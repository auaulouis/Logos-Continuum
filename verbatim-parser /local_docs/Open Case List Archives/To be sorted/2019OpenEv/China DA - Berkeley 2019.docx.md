**[[China's role as an arms exporter]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the Arab
world [[is among the many uncertainties tainting Chinese foreign
policy,]{.mark} due to the secretive nature of arms deals]{.underline}.
China is the world's third largest exporter of arms, behind the United
States and Russia, representing around [6.2% of global
trade](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1069317.shtml) for conventional
major arms. In the Middle East, China currently ranks fifteenth on the
arms suppliers list, while the U.S. remains the [largest
provider](https://www.sipri.org/commentary/blog/2017/state-major-arms-transfers-8-graphics).
[As China continues to foster]{.underline} its approach of [economic
diplomacy]{.underline} in the region, [[many states
are]{.underline}]{.mark} becoming increasingly [[attracted to using
China as a "Plan B" for arms supply, **filling in** any blockage of arms
sales from the US]{.underline}]{.mark} or Europe. [Unlike the
US]{.underline} and Russia, [Chinese arms deals]{.underline} have
traditionally [focus]{.underline}ed [on commercial, rather than
political purposes.]{.underline} Despite this, the growing influence of
China on the world stage begs the question as to what strategic role
Chinese arms sales will play in one of the world's most volatile
regions. This article analyzes China's role as an arms exporter to the
Arab world since the 1980s and argues that the Chinese approach to arms
sales will remain focused on commercial, rather than political reasons.
These [arms sales have become an increasingly attractive option to the
states]{.underline} in the region, [especially in times of need,
and]{.underline} also [represent Xi Jinping's attempt at win-win,
cooperation-based]{.underline} approach to [foreign policy]{.underline}.
These [sales will continue despite]{.underline} the slim chance that
(and/or perhaps unwillingness) by China to replace [US arms sales in the
region]{.underline}, given the former's five-fold deficit in [global
annual
sales](https://www.sipri.org/news/press-release/2018/asia-and-middle-east-lead-rising-trend-arms-imports-us-exports-grow-significantly-says-sipri)
compared to the US and the more advanced military technology that the US
offers. Despite the limited availability of precise numbers on Chinese
arms sales, [scholars and policymakers]{.underline} can [look to
official [Chinese]{.mark} government [documents]{.mark} that
[illustrate]{.mark}]{.underline} its [overall arms export
strategy]{.underline} in the Middle East. These include the recent Arab
Policy Paper, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (FPPC), and
the official arms sales justifications and statements provided by the
government. The Arab Policy Paper --- the first one ever to be released
publicly by the government in 2016 --- shows China's new approach to
Chinese-Arab relations and serves a basis to understand its broader
Middle East strategy. [[The
paper](http://www.china.org.cn/world/2016-01/14/content_37573547.htm)
refers to]{.underline} the importance of pursuing [[a "new type of
international relations]{.mark}"]{.underline} in the Arab world [[that
promotes]{.mark} "win-win cooperation and]{.underline} win-win
[strategy."]{.underline} The document also [lays out the]{.underline}
government's [vision to implement]{.underline} concrete steps to enhance
Sino-Arab [[military cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} and support the
Arab states' national defense and military forces. The FPPC is
illustrative of China's approach to military arms sales and President Xi
Jinping's pursuit of a win-win foreign policy. The [[key
principles](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-06/26/content_17617847.htm)
outlined]{.underline} in the document, [including mutual respect for
sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference,
peaceful co-existence, and benefits]{.underline}, speak directly to its
arms sales strategy. In 2016, [in a speech]{.underline} to the Arab
League in Cairo, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping further [reinforced the
Chinese position]{.underline}, stating that China will "build a
cooperative partnership network for win-win outcomes. In 2014, after
Saudi Arabia confirmed its purchase of DF-21 missiles from China, the
Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson stated that China's arms exports
are based on three principles: "Strengthening the defensive capabilities
of the importers, not harming world or regional peace, security and
stability, and not interfering in other states' internal
affairs."[\[i\]](https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/chinas-arms-sales-philosophy-arab-world#_edn1)
Upholding such principles are not only beneficial to China, but also
attractive to the recipient states, which often adopt similar rhetoric
in foreign affairs. For example, Saudi and Emirati official statements
have typically echoed the same principles to justify any arms purchase,
whether from the United States, Russia, China, or others. Based on this
win-win outlook, China's arms sales policy to Arab states is conducted
primarily for economic reasons. When mutually beneficial, [**[dealing
with China may be an attractive alternative]{.mark}** that
is]{.underline} perhaps [less likely to involve political
strings]{.underline}, complications, [or potential repercussions
that]{.underline} typically [accompany arms deals with the
US.]{.underline} For example, [U.S. arms sales]{.underline} and
economic/military aid to Egypt [is primarily intended to exert
influence]{.underline} on the Egyptian government [to promote American
priorities]{.underline}, including Egypt's peace with Israel. **[For the
US, [arms sales are]{.mark}]{.underline}** in part **[[an exercise of
influence]{.underline}]{.mark}** and reward **[to ensure loyalty, which
can be cut off or suspended, depending on]{.underline}** the political
dynamics and **[U.S.]{.underline}** policy **[preference.]{.underline}**
Contrary to the U.S. approach, Chinese arms sales are focused on
"business only and [business
first](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10670564.2015.1013379?journalCode=cjcc20)."
China sees the Arab world and the Middle East as a whole as a new market
for its low-cost high-tech weapons and thus has an appetite to sell
weapons to any state in the region, regardless of its policies. China
uses its role as a leading oil importer as leverage (for example, it
threatened to decrease oil imports from Saudi Arabia over a price issue)
and has [rarely used arms
sales](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/06/14/china-smells-opportunity-in-the-middle-easts-crisis/),
or the threat to cut them off, as a political tool. For example, it
sells weapons to both Saudi Arabia and Iran, who are not on the same
page when it comes to regional issues. There are, however, exceptions to
this general rule, including China's position against the Soviet Union
during the Cold War, and current issues of national security that would
naturally preclude it from arms sales (e.g., Taiwan). For example,
during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the U.S., Pakistan, and China sold
arms including stingers and missiles to the Mujahedeen, who were
resisting Soviet influence. In 1975, after the Khmer Rouge came to power
in Cambodia, China and the U.S. supplied arms to counter the Soviet
supported Vietnamese government. Compared to annual value of arms sales
by the U.S., EU, and Russia, China's operation in the Middle East is
small. The U.S. is the largest arms exporter to the Middle East and the
world and will likely remain so due to its advanced technology, hegemony
of the international system, control over oil market and access, and
strong ties with the Arab world, specifically the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC). Nearly half of U.S. arms exports go the Middle East, with
Saudi Arabia ranking as the [second largest
importer](https://www.sipri.org/news/press-release/2018/asia-and-middle-east-lead-rising-trend-arms-imports-us-exports-grow-significantly-says-sipri)
of U.S. arms. China is [among the top arms
exporters](https://www.sipri.org/news/press-release/2018/asia-and-middle-east-lead-rising-trend-arms-imports-us-exports-grow-significantly-says-sipri),
but its main clients tend to be its surrounding neighbors such as
Pakistan, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. However, there has been a
[substantial
increase](http://www.kfcris.com/pdf/07b46fba22562acf20bb92fb68f5ea5c5aaa11036d535.pdf)
in China's military spending and arms industry and production, that may
continue to spark Chinese exports to the region. China's arms exports
increased by 74% year-over-year in 2012, as [China sold \$753 million in
arms](http://www.kfcris.com/pdf/07b46fba22562acf20bb92fb68f5ea5c5aaa11036d535.pdf)
to the Middle East, compared to U.S. sales of \$28.5 billion. According
to [a
report](https://www.sipri.org/commentary/blog/2017/state-major-arms-transfers-8-graphics)
by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Chinese
arms exports "nearly doubled over the past five years, and China's arms
imports decreased by 25 percent." Continued technological improvements
along with successful cooperation between China and Gulf countries will
promote increased arms sales in the region for decades to come. Despite
the slim chance that China threatens the United States' status as the
number one arms exporter in the region, Chinese "arms sales will
definitely surge in the years to come" due to high demand and [spending
by Arab
states](http://www.kfcris.com/pdf/07b46fba22562acf20bb92fb68f5ea5c5aaa11036d535.pdf).
According to SIPRI, Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) have some of the fastest growing military budgets in the
world. Over the past few years, Saudi Arabia's [defense budget
increased](https://www.sipri.org/news/press-release/2018/asia-and-middle-east-lead-rising-trend-arms-imports-us-exports-grow-significantly-says-sipri)
from \$27.1 billion (2010) to \$56 billion (2018), which represents 10%
of its GDP. The UAE has a \$22.8 billion annual defense budget,
representing 6% of its GDP. Recently, the UAE [expressed
interest](http://www.kfcris.com/pdf/07b46fba22562acf20bb92fb68f5ea5c5aaa11036d535.pdf)
in China's Pterosaurs-1 UAV, which has the capability to carry BA-7 and
YZ-212 missiles, while Saudi Arabia purchased Chinese missiles and
[signed an
agreement](http://www.kfcris.com/pdf/07b46fba22562acf20bb92fb68f5ea5c5aaa11036d535.pdf)
to build a manufacturing facility of drones in the Kingdom. [[Another
factor that]{.mark}]{.underline} may **[[contribute to increased Chinese
arms sales is U.S. unwillingness to sell]{.mark} certain types of
weaponry [to certain countries]{.mark} in certain
situations]{.underline}**, often [depending on domestic]{.underline}
political power and/or domestic [pressure.]{.underline} For Arab states,
[China can serve as a "Plan B,]{.underline}" something China can exploit
to its own economic advantage. **[For [example,
China's]{.mark}]{.underline}** 1988 intermediate-range **[[ballistic
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}** (IRBMs) sale [**[to Saudi Arabia]{.mark}
resulted from U.S. unwillingness**]{.underline} to do so because of
Israeli opposition. This event, at least within the GCC, **[set the
precedent]{.underline}** for Arab and specifically GCC states **[that
[China can play an increasingly important role in filling
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** selective **[[vacuum]{.mark} left by the US for
arms sales]{.underline}** in the region. [In 2015, [China [sold armed
drones](http://nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/saudi-arabia-arms-sale-yemen-war.html)]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to the Kingdom after the Obama]{.underline} administration [blocked
drone sales **because of the war in Yemen**]{.underline}. The US has
sold its armed drones only to Italy and the United Kingdom, whereas
[[China]{.underline} has [sold]{.underline}
them](https://tcf.org/content/report/rising-china-eyes-middle-east/) [to
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq,]{.underline} and the [UAE]{.underline}. China
has also sold weapons to [non-U.S.
allies](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-changing-oil-strategy-and-its-foreign-policy-implications/),
including [Sudan, Syria, and Iran.]{.underline} China's **[commercial
motives do not suggest a]{.underline}** complete **[lack of interest in
influencing the region]{.underline}** and maintaining political
stability. China is the world's largest oil importer of Saudi oil, and
as such, stability in the Middle East is critical to China. Chinese
[arms sales]{.underline} to the region [is]{.underline} arguably
motivated to maintain oil flows from friendly leaders from Arab oil
exporting states and [a]{.underline} necessary [tool for China to foster
and enhance]{.underline} energy [ties]{.underline}. It is no coincidence
that the major oil exporting countries in the region, including Saudi
Arabia, UAE, and Iran, are all purchasing weapons from China. The
commercial nature of Chinese arms sales gives it short-term and
long-term advantages. Commercially, [arms sales]{.underline} not only
[foster stronger economic ties with]{.underline} Arab
[states]{.underline}, to which China remains dependent on their oil
exports, but also give China a chance to ask for a decrease in the cost
of importing energy from the region. [China has the ability to use arms
sales as leverage to receive]{.underline} low oil prices and/or
[concessions]{.underline}, an important tool given its significant
growth in oil demand and dependency on imports. U.S. and Western
[policymakers and scholars view]{.underline} increased Chinese [arms
sales]{.underline} to the region [as]{.underline} not merely
economically motivated, but also [intended for China's own power
projection and mitigation of U.S. power]{.underline} in the region.
China often criticizes U.S. interference in Middle East affairs,
including the strong presence of U.S. forces in the Gulf (and beyond).
The primary objectives for the US, from China's view, are to maintain,
control, and ensure access to energy resources in the region.
[[Chinese]{.mark} [actions]{.mark}]{.underline} to cooperate with both
U.S. and non-U.S. allies, like Iran and Syria, [[are intended
to]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least in part, [[exert its own
influence]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 1991, [the Chinese provided Iran
with]{.underline} sophisticated dual use [nuclear
technology]{.underline} and natural uranium [under the umbrella of
[nuclear
"cooperation."](https://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/OP351.html)]{.underline}
This, among other factors, [allowed China to build up its image
as]{.underline} an attractive and [easy to deal with]{.underline} arms
provider, [serving an entry point]{.underline} to its long-term
strategic presence [without]{.underline} appearing to have an interest
in [picking sides]{.underline}. Arms sales are part of China's win-win
cooperation and strategy-based foreign policy. Doing so is a rather
unconventional approach to international arms sales, as they have
traditionally been used as a political tool, with the United States as
the top player. China's approach can help its long-term strategic
posture in the region by promoting stronger ties with the Arab states,
ensuring oil flows, and opening a door to economic expansion in the
Middle East through investments and Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs).
Although there are no recent instances of China using arms sales to
exert influence in the Middle East, this does not mean that the
commercial nature of Chinese arms sales is not also linked to national
security interests. The Chinese government's **[[arms exports philosophy
stems from its interest to maintain strategic
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the Arab states in order to best
increase its prospects for securing its business and energy interests in
the region, [regardless of the recipients']{.underline} country's
[intensions]{.underline}. It can therefore be said that PRC arms sales
are exemplified in Xi Jinping's overall win-win, cooperation-based
foreign policy and can in turn have key implications to understanding
the global arms trade of this century.

Michael, \"The New Containment,\" Feb 12,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-02-12/new-containment

WILL AMERICA LEAD? [The weakest link in the chain may be the most
powerful country itself. [There are reasons to]{.mark}]{.underline}
expect the American public to [[support a leading role in the
**containment**]{.underline}]{.mark} of Russia,
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and Iran. The United States has a long
history with such a foreign policy. [The approach has geopolitical logic
behind it, promising to protect American interests in crucial parts of
the world at a reasonable price]{.underline}. But there are also reasons
for skepticism. Today's threats appear less urgent, coping with them
will be more complicated, and the country's attitude toward foreign
entanglements has understandably soured over the last two decades. The
United States was pulled into both world wars by external attacks, and
Americans gave their support to a foreign policy of global reach during
the Cold War because they were persuaded it would head off yet another
world war. After the Soviet collapse, many of the Cold War arrangements
persisted through inertia and gained support because they seemed to
entail little expense or risk. Now that the expenses and risks of such a
policy have increased, many Americans may reconsider their support. The
skepticism has deepened because of the county's recent misadventures
abroad. The interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya turned out
poorly, and the public has little taste for more. This view has much to
recommend it. But it need not threaten the prospects of a new
containment, because that course is quite different from the failed
crusades of recent decades. Those involved efforts to transform the
internal politics and economies of weak states. Containment involves the
opposite, checking the external conduct of strong states. If national
leaders can appreciate and explain the difference, they may be able to
bring the public along. The resurgence of populism, finally, makes any
such project more difficult. The essence of populism is hostility to
elites, and the design and conduct of foreign policy are elite
activities. The foreign policy establishment favors a robust American
role in the world. That may be a good enough reason for
antiestablishment rebels, including the populist in chief now residing
in the White House, to oppose one. So the future direction of American
foreign policy is unclear[. [Washington might forgo leading
coalitions]{.mark} to contain the three [revisionist powers, in which
case their strength will increase]{.mark}. [**Emboldened by the American
abdication**, they may grow **aggressive** and try to coerce their
neighbors.]{.mark} Those neighbors currently rely on the American
nuclear arsenal to protect them; [if they]{.mark} come to [doubt the
credibility of American security guarantees, they may]{.mark} follow
Israel and [opt to]{.mark} develop or **[acquire their own
arsenals]{.mark}** in order to protect themselves. [An American retreat
would]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[make]{.mark}]{.underline} the world
more dangerous and **[[nuclear proliferation more
likely]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thanks to the size, geography, and power
of the United States, Americans for many generations have been able to
pay less attention to American foreign policy than have the citizens of
other countries, whose lives and fortunes that policy has more
immediately and directly affected. [Should the country turn decisively
away from its global role and allow the revisionist challenges to
advance unchecked]{.underline}, however, [[Americans' happy
detachment]{.mark} from the world beyond their borders [may
disappear]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[by the time they realize]{.mark}
what they need to protect, it **[may be too late]{.mark}** to do so
without great difficulty and high cost]{.underline}.

Dave, \"The Trump Administration Has a Plan to Compete with Russia and
China over Weapon Sales,\" Aug 9,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/trump-administration-has-plan-compete-russia-and-china-over-weapon-sales-28327

The [Trump]{.underline} Administration [is hoping to boost the export
prospects for American weapons]{.underline} systems [to allied countries
by modifying policies and streamlining the bureaucratic
process]{.underline}. The [Trump]{.underline} Administration [announced
a revised conventional arms transfer policy in April,]{.underline} but
[that is just the first step.]{.underline} There are more policy changes
coming down the line. "The new policy reflects the priorities of the
president's National Security Strategy," Ambassador Tina Kaidanow,
Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, said
on Aug. 8 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Which
are, namely, to preserve peace through strength by reforming regulations
to facilitate the exports of U.S. military equipment; to strengthen
partners and allies; to facilitate U.S. economic security and
innovation." Under the new policy, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [hopes to make its export bureaucracy more
proactive and cut red tape in the process]{.underline}. "These steps are
among the first in what we hope will be a series of efforts to
streamline the arms transfer process," Kaidanow said. "I can assure you
that my colleagues and I at the State Department, but also again more
broadly in the USG, will continue exploring ways to cut red tape and
give U.S. industry every advantage in an increasingly competitive global
marketplace, while continuing to ensure the responsible export of arms."
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is making these policy
changes with great power competition with China]{.underline} and Russia
in mind. "[We're trying to improve our ability to compete with our
adversaries by providing our partners with viable alternatives to
foreign products in order to maintain influence in key
regions]{.underline} throughout the world," Laura Cressey, Deputy
Director for Regional Security and Arms Transfers at U.S. Department of
State, said. "We're going to be working with our partners and allies to
identify critical capability requirements that they have and then trying
to expedite transfers to support these essential foreign policy and
national security objectives." However, writing the policy guidance is
the easy part. Implementing the policy will be far more challenging.
"The release of the new policy was only the first step in a series of
what we believe will be very practical results-focused initiatives to
transform the way that the U.S. government works to support and grow our
defense industrial base," Kaidanow said. "Through that memorandum, the
president also directed the secretary of state, in coordination with the
secretaries of defense, commerce, and energy, to submit an
implementation plan within 60 days." As part of the effort, the United
States is looking at reforming export hurdles such as the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations, which has been a vexing problem for the
defense industry for decades. "We'll look at streamlining the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, and also continuing
to revise the U.S. Munitions List and the Commerce Control List,"
Cressey said. Additionally, the State Department and Defense Department
will try to speed up the bureaucratic processes involved in weapons
exports. "We will also be looking at the day-to-day processes to ensure
that we are as efficient, as streamlined, and as effective as possible,"
Cressey said. "So some of the things that we're looking at, and that
folks in industry and associations have asked us to look at, is:
establishing milestones and timelines for the foreign military sales
process; improving and speeding up our contracting process -- processes
within the Defense Department; trying to increase the competitiveness of
U.S. defense items and systems by building in exportability to the
design and development; and also by expanding support for what we call
non-program-of-record systems. We're looking into potential financing
options that could make our systems more attainable for our foreign
partners. And we're also examining existing polices to ensure that they
don't unnecessarily detract from our ability to compete in international
-- in the international marketplace." [Without the changes, the United
States is increasingly in danger of losing its market share as
China]{.underline}, in particular, [increasing develops and produces
evermore-capable weapons for the export market.]{.underline} [One
example is the]{.underline} Unmanned Aerial Systems (U[AS) market, which
the United States dominates, but which is also threatened by Chinese
competition]{.underline} and by Washington's tight export regulations.
"By removing some of the previous administration's artificial barriers
to the transfer of arms to critical partners, the UAS export policy
being one example, [this administration is both strengthening our hand
in the ongoing strategic competition while also stimulating economic
growth at home, as well as job creation]{.underline}," Alex Gray,
Special Assistant to the President for the Defense Industrial Base,
said. "It should be noted that the U.S. aerospace and defense industries
contribute almost \$1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy and they
support about 2.5 million American jobs. Just as one point, the
international -- UAS export market alone is estimated to be worth more
than \$50 billion a year within the next decade. Those are the stakes
we're competing for." Those nations that are unable to purchase American
weapons could find that China or Russia are more than willing to supply
them with comparable systems. "We are witnessing China -- as an example,
not alone -- but [China filling voids the U.S. left with a denial to a
friend or ally,]{.underline}" Keith Webster, president of the Defense
and Aerospace Export Council at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said.
"[The consequence of a denial filled by China or others is]{.underline}
as follows: [The U.S. loses market share that is not easily recaptured,
and]{.underline} in some cases will never be recaptured. [The U.S. loses
control of the capability. The U.S. loses the opportunity to train,
influence, and maintain a military relationship with foreign
forces]{.underline}, who now are introducing into their inventory a
Chinese -- Korean, Israeli, et cetera -- capability."

University, Senior Fellow in the Brent Scowcroft Center on International
Security at The Atlantic Council; National Bureau of Asian Research, No.
58 "Approaching Critical Mass: Asia\'s Multipolar Nuclear Future,"

RP)

[The most **important reason** to be concerned about nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in Asia, of course, [is the threat]{.underline}
that nuclear [weapons might be used]{.underline}. To be sure, the use of
nuclear weapons remains remote, but the probability is not zero and the
[consequences **could be catastrophic**]{.underline}. The subject,
therefore, deserves careful scrutiny. [Nuclear use would overturn a
**70-year tradition**]{.underline} of nonuse, [could result in
**large-scale**]{.underline} death and [**destruction**, and might **set
a precedent** that shapes how]{.underline} nuclear [weapons
are]{.underline} viewed, [proliferated, and postured]{.underline}
decades hence. [The **dangers of [escalation]{.mark}** [may be magnified
in a **multipolar nuclear order** in which]{.mark} small
[skirmishes]{.mark}]{.underline} present the potential to quickly
[**[draw in]{.mark} multiple [powers]{.mark}**, each
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} a finger on [[the **nuclear
trigger**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The following discussion will explore
the logic of crisis escalation and strategic stability in a multipolar
nuclear order.14 First and foremost, [the existence of multipolar
nuclear powers means]{.underline} that [[crises]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[pit **multiple nuclear**]{.mark}**-armed
[states]{.mark}**]{.underline} against one another. This may be the
result of formal planning if a state's strategy calls for fighting
multiple nuclear-armed adversaries simultaneously. [A state may **choose
such a strategy** if it believes]{.underline} that a [war with
one]{.underline} of these states [would **inevitably mean** war with
both]{.underline}. Alternatively, in a war between state A and state B,
[[state]{.mark} A [may decide to conduct a **preventive strike**]{.mark}
on state C for fear]{.underline} that [it would]{.underline} otherwise
[seek to **exploit the aftermath** of]{.underline} the [war]{.underline}
between states A and B. [Given U.S. nuclear strategy]{.underline} in the
early Cold War, for example, [it is likely that a nuclear war between
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the Soviet Union would
have]{.underline} also [resulted in]{.underline} U.S. [**nuclear attacks
against China**, even if China had not been a **direct
participant**]{.underline} in the precipitating dispute. In addition,
[[conflicts of interest]{.underline}]{.mark} between nuclear powers
[[may]{.mark} **inadvertently [impinge]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} the interests of [[other]{.mark} nuclear-armed
[states]{.mark}, **drawing them into conflict**. There is always a
danger]{.underline} that [one nuclear power could take action against
a]{.underline} nuclear [rival and that this]{.underline} action [would
unintentionally **cross a red line**]{.underline} for a third nuclear
power, [[triggering a **tripartite nuclear
crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Linton Brooks and Mira Rapp-Hooper have
dubbed this category of phenomena the "security trilemma."15 For
example, [if the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [were to
engage in a show of force in an effort to **signal resolve** to
Russia]{.underline}, such as the flushing of nuclear submarines, [this
action could]{.underline} inadvertently [trigger a crisis **for China**.
[There is also]{.mark}]{.underline} the issue of [**["catalytic"
war]{.mark}**. This may be the first mechanism]{.underline} by which
Cold War [strategists feared that [multiple]{.mark} nuclear
[players]{.mark} could **[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
[[**motivations** for]{.underline}]{.mark} a [nuclear
[exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}. They worried that [a third nuclear
power]{.underline}, such as China, [might conduct a]{.underline} nuclear
[strike]{.underline} on one of the superpowers, [leading the wounded
superpower to **conclude wrongly**]{.underline} that [the
other]{.underline} superpower [was responsible and thereby **retaliate
against an innocent state**]{.underline} presumed to be the aggressor.
This outcome was seen as potentially attractive to the third state as a
way of destroying the superpowers and promoting itself within the global
power hierarchy. Fortunately, this scenario never came to pass during
the Cold War. With modern intelligence, reconnaissance, and early
warning capabilities among the major powers, it is more difficult to
imagine such a scenario today, although [this risk is]{.underline} still
[conceivable among less **technologically developed** states. In
addition to acting]{.underline} directly [against one another, nuclear
[powers could be **drawn into**]{.mark}]{.underline} smaller [conflicts
between]{.underline} their **[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and brought
face to face [in peak crises. International relations]{.underline}
theorists [discuss]{.underline} the concept of [**["chain
ganging"]{.mark}** within alliance relationships, the
dangers]{.underline} of [which [are **more severe**]{.mark}
when]{.underline} the possibility of nuclear [escalation is
present]{.underline}.16 Although this was a potential problem even in a
bipolar nuclear order, [the more nuclear weapons states present, the
**greater the likelihood** of]{.underline} multiple nuclear powers
[entering a crisis. A similar logic suggests]{.underline} that **[[the
more fingers]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the nuclear trigger, [**[the more
likely]{.mark}** it is]{.underline} that [nuclear weapons will be used.
Multipolar nuclear [crises are **not without historical
precedent**]{.mark}]{.underline}.17 Several [Cold War crises featured
the]{.underline} Soviet [Union against]{.underline} the United States
and its [European nuclear-armed allies]{.underline}, Britain and later
France. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War involved the United States, the Soviet
Union, and a nuclear-armed Israel. The United States has been an
interested party in regional nuclear disputes, including the Sino-Soviet
border war of 1969 and several crises in the past two decades on the
Indian subcontinent. Indeed, [many of these crises stand out
as]{.underline} among [[the **most dangerous**]{.mark} of the nuclear
era]{.underline}.

### UQ -- China Sales Down

#### China's sales are low now, but new markets created by the plan help them take off

**Bitzinger 2019** - Visiting Senior Fellow with the Military
Transformations Program at the S Rajaratnam School of International
Studies\
Richard A, \"How China Weaponizes Overseas Arm Sales,\" Apr 16,
https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/04/opinion/how-china-weaponizes-overseas-arms-sales/

Weaponizing arms exports Admittedly, [China remains a smallish arms
exporter, compared to the United States, which dominates the global arms
bazaar, t]{.underline}ypically capturing 35% to 40% of the market.
Moreover, [Beijing is still overwhelmingly dependent on sales to just a
few countries, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.]{.underline} It [also
still relies on countries either too poor to buy Western armaments or
who have been subjected to arms embargoes]{.underline}. [Few
big-spending arms importers]{.underline} -- such as the oil-rich Gulf
states -- [have ever been interested in Chinese arms]{.underline} (other
than armed drones). Iran used to be a major consumer of Chinese arms,
but it has not placed a new order with Beijing in several years.
Nevertheless, China's growing, cumulative political, economic, and
military rise is reshaping global as well as regional geopolitics,
including strategic alliances and balances of power -- and arms exports
are a critical ingredient in this remaking. [While Chinese arms exports
may have had their beginnings in mostly economic rationales]{.underline}
-- such as profits and support for the domestic arms industry --
[increasingly overseas arms sales are being used as a tool to advance
Beijing's strategic interests]{.underline}. This is self-evident in the
growing range of Chinese arms sales -- especially to Africa and Latin
America -- and in Beijing's readiness to sell its most advanced weapons
systems with no political strings attached and generally at prices below
those of Western competitors. As such, [arms exports will also
increasingly figure in the growing strategic competition with the United
States.]{.underline} The arms competition between these two countries --
both in East Asia and increasingly globally as well -- is synonymous
with their emerging great-power rivalry. In this regard, [China has a
growing capability to shape the direction and character of this arms
competition]{.underline} -- not only through its military-technological
development and diffusion of arms exports[, but more importantly,
through its strategic choices that influence the contours of alliances
and military advantage in different geographic areas]{.underline}.

#### Chinese sales are low now -- buyers prefer to buy American

**SCMP 2018** - \"How can China boost weapons exports in face of fierce
competition, quality issues,\" Oct 31, News p. 4, ProQuest

The biennial Airshow China expo in Zhuhai, which starts tomorrow, will
showcase many advanced, Chinese-made weapons to potential customers in
Asia and Africa. More than 900 Chinese weapons will be on display,
according to the organiser of the six-day show, which will feature more
than 700 exhibitors from more than 42 countries and regions - with more
than 400 exhibitors from China alone. Another important factor is that
major importers of arms lack the required political trust in China. But
[while military experts say the quality of cheaper Chinese weapons has
improved, Chinese manufacturers are still struggling to build brands in
an international market dominated by competitors from the United States
and Russia]{.underline}. At September\'s Africa Aerospace and Defence
air show in Pretoria, South Africa, Chinese -exhibitors struggled to
find buyers even though Beijing tried hard to secure sales of its Hongdu
L-15 Falcon trainer and JF-17 fighter, Andrei Chang, the founder of
military magazine Kanwa Asian -Defence, told the South China Morning
Post. He said Cameroon had -received four Harbin Z-9WE attack
helicopters from China after Beijing offered a US\$100 -million loan
last year, but one of them had crashed soon after being handed over.
[Cameroon was still negotiating with China over the incident and had no
plans to buy any more Chinese weapons due to quality
concerns]{.underline}, Chang said. Professor Jonathan Holslag, head of
research at the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies, said
financial problems were causing many countries, -including South Africa,
to be more hesitant and cautious when buying new arms. \"There is also
fierce competition and many countries are willing to make offers at
knockdown prices,\" Holslag said, adding that many of Beijing\'s
previous clients harboured quality concerns. \"[Military sales come with
important maintenance and training services and China still has a way to
go in this regard]{.underline},\" he said. [Chinese arms manufacturers
may find it even more challenging to make sales following the reported
failure of Chinese-made -C-705 anti-ship missiles to hit their
targets]{.underline} during an Indonesian exercise in September that was
watched by Indonesian President Joko Widodo. IHS Jane\'s reported that
two -C-705 missiles failed to hit their targets after being fired from
two of the Indonesian navy\'s KCR-40-class missile attack craft during
the large-scale Armada Jaya 2016 exercise in the Java Sea on September
14.

### AT: UQ overwhelms 

#### Chinese sales haven't gone to new markets, plan changes that

policy?,\" Jul 7,
https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2018/07/07/are-arms-exports-a-tool-of-chinese-foreign-policy/

[The reform of China's defence industry is far from complete, and the
industry still faces obstacles including the dominance of state-owned
enterprise monopolies and a lack of clear legislative and regulatory
framework]{.underline}s for civil--military integration. But overall,
Beijing's reform efforts have not gone without effect. [A number of
Chinese firms are leading the development and export of]{.underline}
unmanned aerial vehicles ([UAVs)]{.underline}. In 2017, the China
Electronics Technology Group Corporation and the China Aerospace Science
and Technology Corporation worked with a commercial fixed-wing drone
model by Skywalker Technology to launch in the world's largest
fixed-wing drone swarm. By 2018, China had exported heavy and armed UAVs
to more than 10 countries worldwide. [The modernisation of the Chinese
defence industry]{.underline}, in combination with competitive pricing[,
has enabled China to become a major arms exporter and not be dependent
on imports]{.underline}. While the volume of Chinese arms exports grew
by 275 per cent between 2000 and 2017, its arms imports decreased by 56
per cent, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. Over the past ten years, China accounted for 5.2 per cent of
total arms trade, behind the United States (32.4 per cent), Russia (23.7
per cent), Germany (6.6 per cent) and France (6.2 per cent). But [the
geographical distribution of Chinese arms sales has not varied
significantly over time.]{.underline} [China still mainly sells to its
traditional customers Pakistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh, which account
for 63 per cent of its total exports over the past five
years.]{.underline} The only region to which there has been a visible
increase in Chinese arms exports is Latin America, from 0 per cent in
the early 2000s to 5 per cent by 2017. This includes arms transfers to
Bolivia and Venezuela in particular.

Keep China Down, Russia Out, and Friendly States In A smart [[arms
transfer policy would strangle]{.mark} both Russia, the number two
exporter, and [China]{.mark}, which is trying to take its place. Russia
in particular needs arms exports to fund its aggressive but underfunded
military modernization plans (not to mention hard currency for its weak
economy). [It is in America's interests to choke off as large a
percentage of the]{.mark} Russian [export market as possible]{.mark} in
favor of the products of more closely aligned countries.]{.underline} In
terms of both American influence and curbing proliferation, it is better
for countries like Malaysia and Indonesia to buy German or South Korean
submarines than Russian. This will have the added benefit of diminishing
the quality and, eventually, raising the price of the products Russia
will export to states, such as Syria, that cannot buy arms from anywhere
else. In the spirit of bolstering potential partners and limiting the
reach of Russian weapons, the United States can directly compete against
Russia in one important market. India accounts for a stunning 39 percent
of Russia's recent arms exports (SIPRI). Indian orders might be big
enough to provide some meaningful economic benefits to the United
States, but more importantly, U.S. sales would cut into Russia's market
share. Tying India and the United States closer, even if it means
allowing most production, jobs, and even some technology transfer to go
abroad, should be a central goal of U.S. arms transfer policy. [Lockheed
Martin's offer to transfer the F-16 production line to
India](http://carnegieendowment.org/2017/08/02/americans-are-back-f-16-for-iaf-and-f-18-for-indian-navy-pub-72706)
appears a step in this direction. America should accept that Saudi
Arabia is going to buy a lot of U.S. weapons, but avoid coddling the
Kingdom. [Saudi Arabia (and its Gulf State allies) will remain an
important customer largely because the country is desperate to keep the
United States involved in the region. The Saudi military is almost
entirely American equipped and trained and most of its military
capability requires continued American support to function for more than
a couple of days.]{.underline} A few additional jobs may result from
selling more arms to the Kingdom, but this may not justify giving up the
leverage over Saudi and its allies' policies towards Yemen, Syria, and
Qatar that do not necessarily advance American interests. The United
States should encourage, but steer, Europe. Since the Cold War the
United States has used its economic and political clout to
[systematically inhibit an independent European defense production
capability](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00396330412331343773).
This has certainly increased U.S. market share, but continued efforts
come at the expense of more important political goals. It would be much
easier to ask NATO allies to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense if
more of this money would go into indigenous industries. The United
States should recognize that European global competitiveness in the arms
trade can serve American interests (and perhaps provide competition for
its own sheltered defense industry). This will relieve pressure on
Europe to export to countries embargoed by the United States, which
undermines the influence of U.S. arms transfer policy. When the United
States placed real restrictions on arms transfers to Egypt's al-Sisi
regime, other states quickly attempted to fill this gap. As one French
policymaker cynically noted, "[Obama was the \[French fighter jet\]
Rafale's best
salesperson](http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/08/21/ventes-d-armes-la-strategie-gagnante-de-la-france_4732524_3232.html)."
Overall, from 2012-2015 the export agreements of major European sellers
to Egypt [have gone up
forty-seven-fold](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2017-05/us_conventional_arms_transfers_to_developing_nations_2008-2015.pdf)over
the previous four-year period. That said, Europe has by and large
cooperated with successful arms embargoes against Russia and China
(although [Europe does sell nearly \$400 million of dual use equipment
to China each
year](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2131937/chinas-military-build-may-be-game-changer-european-arms)).
Maintaining and even tightening these key sanctions must be the highest
priority of any defense cooperation policy with Europe. More broadly,
fixation on "buying American" misses tremendous opportunities for
leading coordinated action with like-minded states in Europe and
elsewhere. This is feasible given that the United States, NATO members,
South Korea, Israel, and a few other allies account for a whopping 62
percent of total global arms exports
([SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers)). To this end,
the United States should liberalize its own market. Much as when
"foreign" automotive firms build their cars in the United States,
acquiring products from abroad may create more jobs than selling weapons
internationally. The U.S. Air Force's current \$16 billion
fighter-trainer contract has been largely narrowed down to [three
candidates with foreign
connections](https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/t-38-replacements-180967111/):
a Lockheed Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries version of Korea's T-50; a
new design from a Boeing-Saab team; and an entirely foreign offering
from Leonardo. Winning such a contract will give one of three
like-minded states (South Korea, Sweden, or Italy, respectively) a boost
in other international competitions against less scrupulous dealers. And
the United States can still shape these exports for its political
interests, such as when it [recently vetoed the T-50's export to
Uzbekistan](https://thediplomat.com/2015/10/us-stops-export-of-korean-fighter-jets-to-uzbekistan/).
America is Like No Other Arms Exporter and Should Act Like It [[The
United States --- by dint of its]{.mark} huge military [budget]{.mark},
massive [defense R&D, and]{.mark} long [dominance of the global arms
market --- can use arms transfers in ways beyond]{.mark} the dreams of
[its competitors]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, many competitors
recognize this, albeit grudgingly. I have interviewed officials in
multiple countries (both clients and competitors of the United States)
claiming they will defer to U.S. wishes on arms exports if they trust it
is done for political rather than economic reasons. Many of America's
closest allies, who are also arms export competitors, look to the United
States for leadership on controversial importers such as Saudi Arabia.
And, the Trump administration should be given due credit for exercising
discretion, given, for instance, its recent [unilateral embargo on arms
transfer to South
Sudan](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/world/africa/us-arms-ban-on-south-sudan-.html).
In fact, one administration official stated flatly that sales "[will not
come at the expense of human
rights](https://breakingdefense.com/2018/03/nsc-readies-major-overhaul-in-us-arms-exports/)."
In no small part, **[[U.S. domination of the]{.mark} global [arms trade
is based on the]{.mark} world's [belief that the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [uses its clout to advance]{.mark} its [political
ends,]{.mark} not economic gain. [Destroying this reputation
will]{.mark} do little to bring jobs to the United States, while doing
much to [damage American influence]{.mark} abroad.]{.underline}**

PLAN = People's Liberation Army Navy

**[China\'s defensive concerns have traditionally been continental in
nature]{.underline}**; thus, the ground forces of the PLA have been the
predominant service, while the navy or maritime concerns have been far
more limited. In building a navy that is only gradually beginning to
deploy out of Asian waters, **[[China is developing a mechanism with
which it can engage others in their own
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The U.S. and British navies have been
global in their deployments for decades, while China has traditionally
been limited to its peripheral seas. [**Today, [the PLAN is using Latin
America as one of several experimental destinations]{.mark}**, where it
can benefit from showing its flag while also making connections with
local navies. The point of the [liaisons with Latin American navies is
not merely to better relations, but to learn how to]{.mark}
[operate]{.mark} successfully [with navies, which operate with the U.S.
Navy, and]{.mark} thus slowly [learn]{.mark} more about [how the latter
engages]{.mark} around the world. [This]{.mark}]{.underline} slowly
deepening **[[confidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, cultivated over the
gradual repetition of brief visits, **[[allows China to expand its
knowledge of the U.S. military]{.underline}]{.mark}** and how it
interacts with partners. This is an indirect manner of learning
something of great interest to China as the PLAN also watches the United
States interact with several maritime allies in the Asia-Pacific region.
**[This enhanced information also accompanies opportunities for the PLAN
to improve its own operational skills in deployment,]{.underline}**
similar to the experience its sailors are gaining from repeated
deployments into the Gulf of Aden for counter-piracy operations.
Similarly, [[the deployment]{.mark} of Peace Ark to Latin America in
September 2011 was a classic example of using a military instrument in a
nonmilitary manner. This vessel [illustrates the]{.mark} fundamental
[reassessment]{.mark} that the [Chinese leadership has taken regarding
its role around the world]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as the selection
of tools with which to interact with others. The role of any hospital
ship is not only to show the flag, thus making presence in a foreign
land clear, but also to provide humanitarian assistance to places where
conditions welcome outside care, which may not arrive in any other form.
In the 2011 Peace Ark voyage, the Chinese medical team offered care to
those in need in Jamaica, Cuba, and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as
China\'s relatively new diplomatic partner, Costa Rica. (15) Since
**[the U.S. Navy has been the traditional military power providing
humanitarian relief in the Western Hemisphere,]{.underline}** the Peace
Ark was a deliberate message from the Chinese to demonstrate improved
capability. Beijing has learned its lesson from its notable absence from
the 2004 tsunami relief efforts in the Indian Ocean\--a region some
called China\'s backyard when the tragedy occurred. Peace Ark also
signaled China\'s willingness to operate in a region traditionally
unwelcome to outsiders because of the Monroe Doctrine\'s unilateral
nature. Although **[[Chinese arms]{.mark} [sales]{.mark} to Latin
America]{.underline}** have been relatively small, such sales **[[are
increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Latin American armed forces still
prefer purchasing their arms from the United States, but the staggering
expense of many U.S. arms packages makes that prohibitive for the less
wealthy Latin militaries. Europe and Brazil remain at least as appealing
as China as sources of arms. The focus of Beijing\'s arms sales to Latin
American governments has been on smaller amounts and less lethal items,
such as uniforms, transports, or small arms. (16) [[As China\'s arms
exports]{.mark} diversify and [expand, and as U.S. systems
become]{.mark} ever more [expensive]{.mark}, it is likely that [China\'s
share of sales will increase]{.mark} as the U.S. share decreases. The
fiscal options available to militaries in the region,]{.underline} along
with their growing responsibilities to address transnational organized
crime, [may in any event force Latin American militaries to focus on
lower-tier weaponry. [If China\'s arms sales move up]{.mark} the scale
in cost, [this would make Latin America]{.mark} continue to [go
elsewhere]{.mark} for its weaponry.]{.underline}

#### China competes directly with the US for access to the arms export market -- any US arms reduction is filled-in with Chinese arms -- key to China's rising political, economic, and military rise and international influence

Now, as a paper I co-authored with Michael Raska (a colleague at the S
Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore) points out[**,
[Chinese arms exports]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} increasingly being employed
as [an **explicit tool of international relations**]{.mark}. In
particular, overseas a[rms sales are being weaponized in the]{.mark}
growing [strategic competition with the United
States]{.mark}.]{.underline}Since the turn of the century[, [China's
defense industry has modernized]{.mark} to the extent that it is now
able to offer an impressive array of armaments]{.underline}, including
fourth-generation fighter jets, trainer jets, antiship cruise missiles,
man-portable SAM systems, self-propelled and towed artillery, armored
vehicles, multiple rocket launchers, large surface combatants, and
submarines. [[Many of these weapons systems are competitive]{.mark} with
their Western counterparts.]{.underline} Of special note, [[China
has]{.mark} quite recently but also quite significantly [become **a key
exporter of armed drones**]{.mark} or unmanned combat aerial
vehicles]{.underline} (UCAVs). According to Chinese sources, Beijing
sold more than US\$700 million worth of UCAVs to militaries in Egypt,
Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia, Turkmenistan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Moreover,
[[Chinese drones have been "bloodied in battle," greatly boosting their
reputation]{.underline}]{.mark}. The UAE and Iraq have used Chinese
drones to attack terrorist sites, while Nigeria has employed Chinese
UCAVs against the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group. Admittedly, China
remains a smallish arms exporter, compared to the United States, which
dominates the global arms bazaar, typically capturing 35% to 40% of the

#### China fills in -- economic incentives

**Bowler '18** (Tim Bowler is a reporter and business analysist for the
BBC news. BBC is the British Broadcasting Company.

Brutal civil wars in Syria and Yemen, coupled with the return of [[great
power rivalries between the US]{.mark}, Russia [and China]{.mark}, have
[brought the world\'s arms trade into]{.mark} sharp [focus]{.mark}. And
unsurprisingly [it is a thriving]{.mark} global [industry]{.mark}, with
the total [international trade]{.mark} in arms now [worth]{.mark} about
\$[100bn]{.mark}]{.underline} (£74bn) per year, Pieter Wezeman, senior
researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(Sipri), tells the BBC. In its latest figures, the defence industry
think tank says that [major weapons sales in the five years to 2017 were
10% higher than in
2008-12.](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2018/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-international-arms-transfers-2017)
And it is the United States that is extending its lead as the globe\'s
number one arms exporter, adds Sipri. It estimates that the US now
accounts for 34% of all global arms sales, up from 30% five years ago,
and are now at their highest level since the late 1990s.is now the
world\'s top importer of US arms \"The US has been open to supplying
arms to a large variety of recipients, and there are a large number of
countries ready to acquire weapons from the US,\" says Mr Wezeman. The
US\'s arms exports are 58% higher than those of Russia, the world\'s
second-largest exporter. And while US arms exports grew by 25% in
2013-17 compared with 2008-12, Russia\'s exports fell by 7.1% over the
same period. It is Middle East states that have been among the US\'s
biggest customers - Saudi Arabia tops the list - with the region as a
whole accounting for almost half of US arms exports during 2013-17. This
comes as arms imports to the region have doubled over the past 10 years,
driven by widespread conflicts across the area - most notably the civil
wars in Syria and in Yemen, which the UN has called the world\'s worst
man-made humanitarian disaster.of Yemen\'s population are in need of
humanitarian assistance Since Yemen\'s civil war started in 2015, Saudi
Arabia and eight other Arab states have carried out an air campaign in
support of forces loyal to President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. These are
fighting Houthi rebels said to be backed militarily by Iran. The UN says
that as of last November, [at least 5,295 civilians had been killed and
8,873
wounded](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/yemen),
although the actual figures are likely to be much higher. The bitter
conflict in Yemen has brought the ethical issues of international arms
sales into sharp relief in many western countries, which have seen Saudi
Arabia and its allies use their advanced weapons systems in the country.
\"Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were major arms
importers anyway,\" says Sipri\'s Pieter Wezeman. \"The major difference
is that now they are using these weapons - in Yemen.\" Arabia and eight
other Arab states are carrying out air strikes to restore President
Hadi\'s government The UN says that Saudi-led coalition airstrikes
continue to be the leading cause of child casualties as well as overall
civilian casualties. Meanwhile, rebel forces have fired artillery
indiscriminately into cities such as Taizz and Aden, killing civilians,
and also fired rockets into southern Saudi Arabia. \"There is a clear
risk that arms sales contribute to human rights violations,\" says
Oliver Feeley-Sprague, arms trade expert at Amnesty International.
\"There are clear violations being committed by all sides. But in
general, the more weapons get supplied, the more they risk being used.\"
The scale of the war in Yemen has led some countries to act: Norway, the
Netherlands, Sweden and Germany among others, have all recently
restricted arms sales to the region. Across in China, its economic rise
has been mirrored by a growing defence budget and its increasing
importance as a global arms supplier. The country is now the world\'s
fifth largest seller of arms. This puts it behind the US, Russia,
France, and Germany, but ahead of the UK. fifth-largest weapons exporter

world where arms sales are rising, the major exception to this seems to
have been Africa. Between 2008-12 and 2013-17 arms imports by African
countries fell by 22%. Yet crucially, the figures here do not tell the

Treaty (ATT) came into force, with the aim of regulating the

including terrorism. [Yet so far its impact has been limited, say
critics](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/). \"We are
disappointed by the way a number of states have decided to implement it,

lawful. However, the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) has been
given permission to appeal against this ruling, and the case will now go
to the Court of Appeal. The UK government says it has \"one of the most
robust export control regimes in the world\". The ATT may have had a
bigger impact on curbing the flow of weapons to non-state actors, says
Sipri\'s Pieter Wezeman - but so far it has not had any visible impact
on the overall trade in arms.

### L -- Africa

#### China will fill any vacuum to expand their military influence over Africa

**Tian 2018** - Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers and Military
Expenditure Programme\
Nan, \"China's Arms Trade: A Rival for Global Influence?,\" Sep 17,
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/09/17/chinas_arms_trade_a_rival_for_global_influence\_\_113806.html

Against the backdrop of the recent China-Africa Defence and Security
Forum, numerous articles have been written questioning the rationale
behind the conference and the potential ramifications of a closer
Sino-African relationship. Prime among those is the link between growing
Chinese arms exports to the region and a way of securing greater
geopolitical influence. [The Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline}
(BRI), announced in 2013, is one significant example where the economic
expansion via the land (belt) and sea (silk road) has challenged the
strategic interests of many states. [Couple this with China's growing
arms industry and arms exports, the question of vital importance is
whether weapon sales have become a new foreign policy tool for China in
Africa]{.underline}. [Development of the Chinese arms industry has
enabled it to become a major arms exporter]{.underline} (number five in
the world) in recent years. According to the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute, between 2008-2012 and 2013-2017, the 38%
increase in total arms exports was second only to Israel. In this time
Chinese export to Africa rose by 55%, and its share of total African
arms imports increased from 8.4 to 17%. [Although Russia remains the
largest supplier of major weapons to Africa]{.underline} (39% of the
region's imports), [some see the rise of Chinese arms exports to the
region as having a threefold rationale]{.underline}: [Beijing's push to
become a major arms producer. Compete against Russia]{.underline} to
capture this growing arms market. [A foreign policy tool to gain
regional influence for future economic and political
interests.]{.underline} Although the total volume of major arms flow
from China to Africa is less than half of Russia's, it sells to far more
African countries than Russia. Between 2013--17, Russia sold major arms
to 14 Africa countries, compared to the 23 of China. This "blanket"
style of selling does not typically fit with the notion of linking
targeted arms sales with foreign policy objectives. The diversity in the
types of weapons and of arms recipients (e.g., from Algeria to South
Africa and Kenya to Cote d\'Ivoire) suggests a more demand and supply
relationship[. As China continues to develop its arms industry, any
international buyer will help expand its network, offer important
developmental feedback, and improve weapon quality and company
profitability]{.underline}. The fall in export of Russian made weapons
to Africa corresponded with the rise in Chinese exports, potentially due
to the availability of more cost-effective options. This is especially
the case in Algeria, where import of major Chinese arms increased by
46-fold between 2008-2012 and 2013-2017, while the transfer of Russian
weapons fell by 35%. Yet in-depth analysis into Chinese arms exports to
Africa shows Algeria as an outlier that is biasing the recent trends. Of
all major weapons exported from China to Africa between 2013 and 2017,
46% went to Algeria, prime among them are three heavy corvettes
delivered in 2015 and 2016. Remove Algeria and major arms exports to
Africa decreased by 12% between 2008-2012 and 2013-2017. Other major
African buyers of Chinese weapons are Morocco and Nigeria. It seems that
suggestions linking China's BRI project, its military base in Djibouti,
and increased military engagement in the related countries are not
founded on arms transfers evidence. The main focus on of Chinese arms
exports remains to its close neighbours. Since 2008, Pakistan (40%) and
Bangladesh (13%) together account for over half of all China's major
weapons exports. Add in Myanmar, and it's a picture where China usually
sells weapons to countries that the West (the US and Western Europe)
does not. Such sales are partly due to less stringent human rights
conditions linked to arms sales and more affordable weapons, but also
recognising the gaps left by the US and thus securing greater
geopolitical influence as part of its foreign policy. Comparing the
types of weapons sold to African and Asia countries reinforces the
argument further. Large ticket items exported to Bangladesh and Pakistan
include frigates, corvettes, submarines, and air defence systems. In
addition to the transfer of the weapon, such transactions (sales and
military aid) include training, maintenance, and exchange of information
on the capability of the weapons. All of which enhances country
relationships and boosts future collaborations. In contrast, weapons
exports to Africa are mostly of lower value in the form of armoured
personnel carriers (APCs), light training aircraft, battle tanks and
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These are akin to one-time
transactions, with limited commitments to training or maintenance. While
the ability to buy expensive high-tech weapons is lower in African
countries compared to neighbours close to China, China has looked to
challenge US influence in Asia with more intimate (military and
economic) relations with the likes of Pakistan and Bangladesh. The same
is not evident in Africa. It has been common knowledge that China has
historically linked arms sales to close neighbours with foreign policy
considerations, extending this to African countries is far less
straightforward. Although this does not mean China has no future
ambitions to use arms exports as a foreign policy tool, evidence from
arms exports over the past ten years presents a far less compelling case
in the present. Instead, China's interests in Africa seem to remain
mainly economic (e.g., Forum on China-Africa Cooperation) focusing on
trade (China is Africa's largest trading partner) and investment deals
with arms sale transactions in a demand and supply basis. However,
[looking into the future and to China's growing geopolitical ambitions,
the defence and security forum might become the launch pad for China to
increase its military influence in Africa and a perfect platform to
integrate its economic partnerships with a military twist]{.underline}.

For most of the 1980s and 1990s, weapons sales to Africa represented
less than 15 percent of its total arms exports. As China has worked to
expand its foothold in the region, this number has grown. Since 2008,
countries in Africa collectively purchased around 21 percent (\$3
billion since 2008) of China's overall arms exports. Northern African
countries are the primary destination of Chinese weapons, constituting
42 percent of Chinese exports to the continent. An additional 29 percent
flows into to Eastern Africa, and the remaining 29 percent are divided
between other African states. This relatively wide market distribution
is somewhat unusual for major arms traders. Of the \$4.9 billion of US
arms exported to Africa over the last decade, roughly 87 percent were
purchased by Egypt and Morocco. Similarly, Algeria and Egypt accounted
for 84 percent of Russian arms transfers in Africa over the same period.
In terms of trade value, Russia leads the pack at \$12.4 billion in
sales since 2008. The US tallied less than half of that at \$4.9
billion, while China sold around \$3 billion.

said, Chinese weaponry is becoming increasingly attractive due in part
to its cost-effectiveness. Although Chinese arms are often less advanced
than those sold by other countries, the DOD notes that "Chinese arms are
less expensive than those offered by the top international arms
suppliers... \[but still\] have advanced capabilities." For example,
[the low-cost K-8 jet]{.underline} trainer is [estimated to make up 80
percent of all jet]{.underline} trainer [aircraft in
Africa]{.underline}. [China is actively working to strengthen its
foothold in certain markets, such as Algeria]{.underline}. [China's
exports to the North African country]{.underline} totaled \$483 million
between 2008 and 2014, but [jumped to \$247 million in 2015]{.underline}
alone [and peaked at \$499 million]{.underline} in 2016 as several
weapon orders were fulfilled. [These procurements included three C-28A
frigates, which were ordered by Algeria in 2012.]{.underline} Although
not a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime, a
non-proliferation agreement targeted at missiles and systems capable of
delivery weapons of mass destruction, Beijing is generally compliant
with international protocols. The 2002 Regulations on the Export Control
of Missiles and Missile-related Items and Technologies, for instance,
outlines measures to safeguard against proliferation. In June 2017,
China published a draft of the Export Control Law, which if enacted will
update existing legislation and establish a comprehensive export control
regime.

### L -- Central Asia

#### China wants to expand into Central Asia -- Nationalism, geopolitical influence, national security, competition with Russia

Studies Institute (SSI) of the U.S. Army War College (USAWC); "New signs
of Chinese military interest in Central Asia"; 1/16/2017; The Central

How can we explain China's moves and their implications? [Four
motives]{.underline}, in particular, [to China's recent military
moves]{.underline} appear to [stand out]{.underline}. First, the
continuing rise of Chinese power in general, and in particular the
[aggressively nationalist foreign policy]{.underline} program [of Xi
Jinping]{.underline}'s government, underlies all of China's activities.
Second, one of the [grandest designs of]{.underline} that policy is
[China's Go West policy]{.underline}. [Expressed in]{.underline} the One
Belt, One Road ([OBOR]{.underline}) policy, now renamed the Belt Road
Initiative, China has undertaken a vast economic-political project [to
bind Central and South Asia]{.underline}, including Pakistan, [to its
geopolitical agenda]{.underline}. Because [China is investing hundreds
of billions of dollars]{.underline} in the area, it is [increasingly
concerned about the safety of its investments and geostrategic
influence]{.underline} in Central Asia. Analysts tend to agree that
these two motives are involved in shaping Chinese policy calculations
about Central Asia. Yet beyond advancing Chinese power and protecting
foreign investments, at least two additional factors are evidently at
play. At home, the Chinese government remains [concerned over the
continuing signs of unrest in]{.underline} Xinjiang among [the Uyghur
population]{.underline}. [Coinciding with the exercises in
Tajikistan]{.underline}, [Beijing]{.underline} has [ordered all
residents of Xinjiang to surrender their passports]{.underline} in order
"to maintain social order" and prevent people, especially young men,
from moving abroad to participate in terrorist movements like ISIS or
the Taliban. This move effectively makes Xinjiang residents serfs who
are bound to the land, and bespeaks the regime's ongoing failure to deal
with its own domestic Muslim issues. It is therefore natural that the
regime resorts to ever more repressive means to prevent the insurgency
in Xinjiang from further linking up with the enduring violence in
Afghanistan and Syria, which has previously seen participation of
Uyghurs. The second motive may be China's [concerns about Afghanistan
and]{.underline} even [Russia]{.underline}'s role there. Recent accounts
in the U.S. press show that the Afghan government has made little or no
progress in reestablishing control by its own means over the country and
that the [Taliban is]{.underline} probably [advancing]{.underline}, not
retreating. Second, on December 2, General John Nicholson, the
[Commander of U.S. and allied forces]{.underline} in Afghanistan,
publicly acc[used Pakistan of supporting the Taliban]{.underline}; and
Russia and Iran of legitimizing the movement. In particular, he [accused
Moscow of competing with NATO]{.underline} in Afghanistan. Russia has
already admitted publicly its intelligence exchanges with the Taliban,
suggesting that Russia on the one hand is pledging its support to NATO
and Central Asian states against Taliban-inspired terrorism, and on the
other supporting the Taliban against allied interests. Analysts and
officials in Beijing, who no doubt are seeing the same evidence, must
then question Russia's willingness and capability to provide security in
Central Asia in defense of Chinese investments there. Clearly Pakistan
and Iran are also unreliable despite whatever benefits their closeness
to Beijing offers China on other issues. Under the circumstances the
temptation to "do it yourself" and have the PLA defend Chinese interests
in these states rather than rely on unreliable local governments becomes
much stronger. IMPLICATIONS: The consequences of what appears to be a
creeping Chinese military involvement in Central Asia are many and
important. At home it suggests that the [Chinese
leadership]{.underline}, like many governments before it that cannot
deal with internal challenges to its rule, [is looking to
internationalize its]{.underline} domestic [security problems and
overcome them by projecting military]{.underline} and other forms of
[power abroad]{.underline}. Yet for over thirty years it has signally
failed to arrest or block the growth of Uyghur unrest and ethno-national
or religious sentiment. There is little reason to believe that a more
aggressive military policy in Central Asia will offer the government in
Beijing a respite from its domestic security dilemmas. Second, one has
to wonder just how much Chinese power is able to induce Iran and even
more importantly Pakistan to support China in its strategic interests.
If China cannot get Pakistan to stop supporting terrorism throughout the
Islamic world despite its huge dependence on China, what does that say
about the relationship between China and Pakistan? And the same question
can apply with even more force to Iran, which is much less dependent on
China for support. Third, if in fact Moscow is playing a double game in
Afghanistan and Central Asia that negatively affects China's interests,
this would seriously undermine the "division of labor" between China and
Russia regarding Central Asia that analysts have hitherto discerned.
[China, with Russian acquiescence]{.underline}, had [become the leading
foreign economic power]{.underline} in the region [but]{.underline} has
repeatedly [stated its disinterest in projecting military
power]{.underline} into Central Asia. This supposedly fostered the
global alliance of Russia and China and allowed them to cooperate on
regional issues in Central Asia without impinging on each other's vital
interests. If [China has now decided]{.underline}, however cautiously,
[to upend that division of labor]{.underline}, possibly [because it
cannot rely on Russian policy]{.underline} or for other reasons, can it
sustain its relationship of cooperation with Russia in Central Asia? In
turn, does [the manifestation of Sino-Russian rivalry and tensions in
Central Asia affect the larger Sino-Russian relationship]{.underline}?
And if so how and where? Fourth, similar questions affect the Central
Asian states. Tajikistan, which has in the past been forced to bow to
Chinese pressure for border rectification and investments, may now see
its military sovereignty compromised and it may not be the only state in
the region to face greater Chinese pressures. How will these states
react to assigns of increased Sino-Russian rivalry where they may well
be pressed to choose sides? And fifth, if China is going to try to
eclipse Russia's security role in Central Asia, how will it react in
Central Asia and globally? Given the visibly growing Russian dependence
upon China for economic and political support, what happens when signs
of Chinese encroachment upon Russian "prerogatives" start to multiply?
Does Moscow want to undertake an "agonizing reappraisal" of its total
foreign and defense polices due to events in Central Asia? And will it
continue to try and play its double game there? It is too early to
discern answers to these questions, yet it is not too early to raise
them. As regards Russia, [Moscow]{.underline} may have [reacted to these
developments]{.underline} [by the announcement of new
exercises]{.underline} recently conducted with Tajikistan and of major
new arms sales. **[Exercises and arms sales have been two of the
principal instruments by which Moscow has secured support from
Tajikistan and its neighbors]{.underline}**, even if the arms sales
often amount to subsidized exports of Russian weapons. Of course, it is
possible that some secret arrangements exist between Beijing and Moscow
regarding exercises with Tajikistan and other Central Asian states. But
in view of China's earlier moves and the well documented signs of
friction between Russia and China in Central Asia despite their division
of labor, such cooperation is not likely. CONCLUSIONS: Instead, it seems
that [China]{.underline}, through these exercises and its earlier calls
in 2016 for a security formula for Central and South Asia, [is spreading
its wings and contemplating a discernible expansion of its power
projection]{.underline} capabilities and even responsibilities. That can
only occur [at the expense of Central Asian states, Russia,
and]{.underline} probably [India]{.underline} as well. This forces us to
ask if [China's already visible economic pull]{.underline} upon Central
Asian states [will be supplemented by]{.underline} their [military
dependence]{.underline} on China, despite their desires to avoid it or
at least avoid Chinese efforts to impose such dependence? To be sure,
China has established itself in Central Asia for years to come, but
would a Chinese move to upgrade its powers and obligations in the region
be met with equal and opposing countermoves from other powers who also
have important equities and interests there? Given the nature of
contemporary international relations, the answer to that question is
almost certainly yes. In other words, a new chapter of the contemporary
great game in Central Asia is underway. And we as analysts if not
participants must get ready for it.

### L -- Drones

#### China will fill-in for the US, results in the spread of drones

**Reimann 2019** - contributor to Foreign Policy In Focus\
Jakob, \"China is Flooding the Middle East With Cheap Drones,\" Feb 18,
https://fpif.org/china-is-flooding-the-middle-east-with-cheap-drones/

The last great revolution on the world's battlefields began with the
advent of the drone era. Particularly in the Middle East, the drone
became the symbol of the U.S. empire operating in a legal vacuum. In the
first decade and a half of the "War on Terror," the U.S. still had a
virtual monopoly on the risk-free execution from thousands of meters
above --- but once the genie is out of the bottle, every attempt to
squeeze it back in is notoriously doomed to failure. And so, quickly
other countries in the region aspired after the financially --- and
politically --- cheap execution by drone. The number of armies with
their own drone fleet is growing rapidly. [A multi-billion-dollar market
with astronomical growth rates opened up --- demand that's essentially
served only by one actor: China.]{.underline} The U.S. has squandered
its lead [The appearance of the Rainbow CH-4]{.underline} --- the
driving force of Chinese combat drones --- [is almost identical to
the]{.underline} notorious [Reaper]{.underline} drone of the U.S. arms
manufacturer General Atomics. While the CH-4 lags behind the Reaper in
most performance parameters, it can keep up with or even outperform its
competitor in some of them. Also, the CH-4's weaponry, the AKD-10
warhead, is almost identical to the Reaper's Hellfire missiles. [The
striking similarity follows a strategy of Chinese engineering well-known
from cell phones or cars: the look of a world-famous Western branded
product is copied with an inferior but sufficiently good quality
compared to that of the original]{.underline} --- but at significantly
less cost. Chinese drones are 50 to 75 percent cheaper than the
originals from the U.S. A late 2015 article published in the Asia Times
suggests that this copying of U.S. technology is likely rooted in
Beijing's data theft. According to records by world-famous NSA
whistleblower Edward Snowden, by 2010 alone "Chinese hackers had
conducted more than 30,000 cyber attacks" on Pentagon computer networks
and other U.S. military agencies in order to "exfiltrate \[data on\]
sensitive military technology." Although there is no final proof that
data on drones were skimmed off too, Asia Times quotes then NSA director
Gen. Keith Alexander, who suggests that it is highly likely that the
Reaper blueprints were part of the Chinese data hack, while military
experts and analysts largely share this view. With the latest model ---
[the CH-7, which is still in the development phase --- China could
possibly pull ahead the U.S. for the first time,]{.underline} military
journal Defense One explains. [The CH-7 "will be the sole option for
buyers wanting to field stealth combat drones]{.underline}," it
predicts. "The United States had a decade-plus head start on \[drone\]
technology," says military expert Paul Scharre, "and has unfortunately
squandered that lead." China captures the market For a long time, it was
only the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel that had combat
drones and used them to execute alleged terrorists --- something that
has changed dramatically in recent years. Meanwhile, the number of
countries with combat drones has swelled to at least 29, as research
organization New America identifies. And 10 countries have demonstrably
used them to kill suspected enemies; in addition to the three mentioned,
there is Iran, Azerbaijan, the UAE, as well as Nigeria, Iraq, Pakistan,
and Turkey (the last four countries drone-killed people on their own
soil). Historically, Israel is the largest drone exporter, with a market
share of over 60 percent in the last three decades. More recently, from
2008-2017, China exported a total of 88 drones to at least 12 countries,
ranking third among the world's drone exporters behind the United States
(351) and Israel (186). However, [while the vast majority of U.S. and
Israeli exports are made up of unarmed reconnaissance drones, China's
sales focus on armed drones]{.underline}. During the mentioned period,
[China exported 68 combat drones, putting it ahead of the U.S. (62) and
Israel (56).]{.underline} Foreign Policy thus recently titled rightly:
"China Has Already Won the Drone Wars." All of the armed forces of the
Chinese military have large fleets of various drones, but Beijing has
used them so far only for disaster relief, surveillance of domestic
critics, and military reconnaissance --- not to kill. (In 2013, Beijing
considered executing by drone a Myanmar drug baron wanted in the murders
of 13 Chinese sailors, but eventually caught and tried him.) Rather,
Beijing appears to be establishing a norm permanently prohibiting lethal
drone strikes in East and South Asia. However, this no-shoot dogma does
not prevent the Chinese arms industry from exporting their drones to
states that are patently using them for killing elsewhere. How China
services U.S. clients While the Pentagon continues to this day to
deliver armed Reaper drones only to the UK, France, and Italy,
purchasers of Chinese combat drones, according to Chinese manufacturers,
include Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, the UAE, and Zambia. So far, the
three largest buyers of Chinese drones are Pakistan (with a share of 25
percent) as well as Egypt and Myanmar (with 23 and 13 percent,
respectively). [Several of Beijing's buyers are close strategic U.S.
allies who have requested the sale of armed drones from Washington to no
avail and have thus fallen back on Chinese products]{.underline}. [The
U.S. is by far the largest arms exporter and usually sells military
equipment to almost every country in the world.]{.underline} According
to the SIPRI research institute, the U.S. sold \$98 billion worth of
weapons to as many as 112 countries in 2007-2017. Hence, on the face of
it, it seems rather counterintuitive that it would hand over the
lucrative battle drone market to China. A recent report by the DIA, the
Pentagon's internal intelligence service, deals with this contradiction.
"[China is a niche provider of armed \[drones\]" in the Middle
East,]{.underline} the report acknowledges, and correctly concludes that
"China faces little competition" as it is not a member of international
export control regimes. In fact, unlike the U.S. and the European
arms-exporting countries, China is not a contracting party to the
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTRC), which strictly regulates the
proliferation of combat drones and makes U.S. drone exports to the
Middle East more difficult. In addition to attempts by the Trump
administration to amend the MTRC, Trump's State Department published a
new export policy in April 2018: "We will remove barriers to the global
\[drone\] market and avoid ceding export opportunities to competitors
where such self-imposed restrictions are unwarranted." Since the wording
does not specify when restrictions are "unwarranted," the new policy can
be understood as blank approval for future drone exports. De facto, it
was also made possible to buy combat drones directly from the
manufacturer, without the government as a broker agent. "To date,
however, that hasn't led to any reported sales to the Middle East,"
Forbes reported late last year. So, in contrast to relatively strict
regulations on U.S. drone exports, China's "no questions asked" policy
allowed it to quickly gain a foothold in the lucrative Middle East drone
market and aggressively expand the course of the proliferation of cheap
drones. State-of-the-art technology perceived as revolutionary always
comes with a certain adulation for its possessor. Thus, a recent report
by London-based military think tank RUSI concludes that "national
prestige and status is the main reason that most states" in the Middle
East increasingly acquire drones, as Middle East Eye reports. However,
in addition to their value as status symbols, in recent years they are
more and more being used strategically on the battlefields of the
region, which the RUSI report attributes largely to increased Chinese
exports. And so Chinese drones also recorded their first deaths: Besides
fatal deployment by the Nigerian army against Boko Haram, since the end
of 2015, the Iraqi military performed more than 260 air strikes against
Islamic State targets with Chinese drones. They gained particular infamy
on April 22 last year, when the UAE executed the de facto president of
Yemen, Saleh Ali al-Sammad, with a Chinese drone, escalating the nearly
four-year war in the country. The murdered Al-Sammad was seen as a
promoter of the UN-mediated peace process in Yemen, whereas his
successor, Mahdi al-Mashat, is an implacable, uncompromising hardliner
and provocateur.

#### Chinese drones will get in the hands of terrorists, makes them uniquely worse than the US

Jakob, \"China is Flooding the Middle East With Cheap Drones,\" Feb 18,
https://fpif.org/china-is-flooding-the-middle-east-with-cheap-drones/

Pandora's box is open [Of particular concern is China's drone policy in
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. [A \$ 65 billion economic program clinched
between the two countries in spring 2017 includes the construction of a
Chinese drone factory in Saudi Arabi]{.underline}a --- the first of its
kind in the region. Initially, the license production of 300 drones was
agreed, which represents a massive figure given the 88 drones that China
has exported in the last decade altogether. However, the license drones
are not exclusively intended for the Saudi Royal Air Force --- [Riyadh
can explicitly market them to other countries in the
region.]{.underline} End-user certificates do not exist for deals with
Beijing. In view of the fact that Saudi Arabia, along with supporting
various jihadist groups in the region, is a close ally of Al Qaeda in
Yemen, it is within the realm of possibility to envision some of these
drones end up in terrorist's hands. [Fueled by Beijing's export
policy,]{.underline} [the threat scenario of drone-armed jihadists has
moved significantly closer.]{.underline} Research by the Jamestown
Foundation shows that we have already entered the era of "unmanned
terrorism." [Groups commonly labelled as "terrorists]{.underline}" from
Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan to Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen [are already
using mini-drones to drop bombs, grenades, and incendiary devices onto
enemy positions or civilian facilities]{.underline}. Further flooding
the region with cheap combat drones from China will certainly heave
these tactics to the next level in the future. Since 2001, thousands of
people, most of them civilians, have been killed by drone in the
so-called "War on Terror," changing the nature of war in its entirety
and exposing civilians in all these undeclared war zones to a permanent
threat on their lives. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Barack Obama proved he
could always escape punishment and international condemnation even after
using drones to turn weddings and funerals into blood baths and mass
graves. And so, the desires of local actors to acquire these practical
killing tools were aroused, too. [The Chinese leadership is exploiting
these developments without compromise and flooding the Middle East with
cheap drones. The consequences of this expansionary policy cannot be
foreseen. Pandora's box is already open.]{.underline}

#### UAV empirics

**CSIS 18** (Center for Strategic and International Studies; Founded by
Georgetown University in 1962, ranked the number one think tank in the
world; "How dominant is China in the global arms trade?"; 5/29/2018;
CSIS;
<https://chinapower.csis.org/china-global-arms-trade/)//Garfield-Ben>

That said, [Chinese weaponry is]{.underline} becoming increasingly
[attractive due in part to its cost-effectiveness]{.underline}. Although
Chinese arms are often less advanced than those sold by other countries,
[the DOD notes that "Chinese arms are less expensive than those offered
by the top international arms suppliers... \[but still\] have advanced
capabilities]{.underline}." For example, [the low-cost K-8
jet]{.underline} trainer is [estimated to make up 80 percent of all
jet]{.underline} trainer [aircraft in Africa]{.underline}. China is
actively working to strengthen its foothold in certain markets, such as
Algeria. China's exports to the North African country totaled \$483
million between 2008 and 2014, but jumped to \$247 million in 2015 alone
and peaked at \$499 million in 2016 as several weapon orders were
fulfilled. These procurements included three C-28A frigates, which were
ordered by Algeria in 2012. Although not a member of the Missile
Technology Control Regime, a non-proliferation agreement targeted at
missiles and systems capable of delivery weapons of mass destruction,
[Beijing is generally compliant with international
protocols]{.underline}. The 2002 Regulations on the Export Control of
Missiles and Missile-related Items and Technologies, for instance,
outlines measures to safeguard against proliferation. In June 2017,
[China published a draft of the Export Control Law, which if enacted
will update existing legislation and establish a comprehensive export
control regime. Beijing]{.underline} has been [quick to adapt its
domestic regulations to]{.underline} account for [emerging technology.
This has enabled it to fill the void left by other suppliers. The
US]{.underline}, which has long been [at the forefront of]{.underline}
unmanned aerial vehicle [(UAV) development]{.underline}, has purposely
[restricted the export of]{.underline} its [UAVs. Regulations
that]{.underline} until recently [characterized long-range unmanned
aerial systems as cruise missiles]{.underline}, have also [limited
overseas access of American UAVs.]{.underline} These factors have
[created a ripe market opportunity for China]{.underline}, which has
[made its UAVs available to countries such as Nigeria and
Egypt.]{.underline} It is worth noting that Chinese weapons have found
their way into various conflict zones. Reports indicate that Chinese
arms have been used during conflicts in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan, and Somalia. In July 2014, China North
Industries Corporation delivered 100 guided missile systems, over 9,000
automatic rifles, and 24 million rounds of ammunition to the South
Sudanese government, whose actions have been widely criticized by the
international community.

### L -- High Tech Weapons

#### China is on the verge of selling high-tech systems

**Farley 2017** Robert, \"Can China Replace the United States as the
World\'s Top Arms Dealer?\" Nov 21,
https://thediplomat.com/2017/11/can-china-replace-the-us-as-the-worlds-top-arms-dealer/

But it may not be too long before the United States needs to worry about
competition directly in its niche. [China is taking steps to modernize
the relationship between its defense industrial base and its technology
sector, with the hope of generating investment in firms that work at the
juncture between the latter and the former]{.underline}. Leveraging the
relationship between civilian and military technology is how the United
State achieved military superiority over the Soviet Union during the
Cold War. It's also been a preoccupation of advocates of the "Third
Offset," which hopes to further harness the U.S. tech sector in the
service of maintaining American superiority in military technology. And
there are indications that the Chinese are ever-more-ready to challenge
the United States in this arena. The Chinese defense industry remains
far more autarkic than the United States', and is still largely state
controlled. But [allowing heavy civilian investment into
military-related civilian industries]{.underline}, as well as focusing
on building linkages between civilian industries and the military,
[could accelerate Chinese innovation.]{.underline} [If China can
successfully connect its burgeoning tech industry with its defense
industrial base]{.underline} (a project that even the United States has
struggled with), [then it can accomplish something that the Soviet Union
utterly failed at]{.underline}. Obviously, many obstacles remain, some
of which the United States also faces. The task of integrating China's
state-owned defense giants with its private sector tech companies will
be enormously complicated, with many potential pitfalls. Not the least
of these is convincing Chinese tech firms that their technologies are
safe in the hands of state-owned defense giants, a task that is probably
even more difficult than getting U.S. tech firms to work with Lockheed
Martin and Raytheon. The eventual outcome might look something like the
European model, where large, state-controlled defense firms have a
tolerably good relationship with the civilian sector. The difference
would be that, as in the United States, the defense industrial base can
count on huge, consistent government outlays. [If China can square the
circle, it can compete with the United States not only on the air and at
sea, but also in the international arms market]{.underline}. Chinese
arms in the hands of traditional U.S. export partners may not be quite
as dangerous as those in Chinese hands, but they have the potential to
undercut a dominant U.S. market position.

suggestions that **[[it is connected with access to]{.mark} markets for

also been suggested that **[[it is a result of efforts by Latin American

Bolivia, Cuba, Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru imported SALW from

Red Arrow-8 (HJ-8) wire-guided antitank missile systems and in December
2006 announced the supply of 'infantry and artillery munitions' as part
of a donation.234 Further donations to the Bolivian armed forces were
announced in 2007, 2009 and 2010 but it is unclear if SALW were part of
these arrangements.]{.underline} China also proposed to replace
Bolivia's HN-5 stocks in 2006 but it is not know if a delivery went

there is limited information on subsequent deliveries of SALW. There
have also been some suggestions that Norinco has supplied its CQ 5.56
carbine, a clone of the US M-4, to Paraguay.237 Peru reported to UNROCA
the import of 15 QW-18 MANPADS from China in 2009 and 15 QW-18s in 2010.

#### US containing Chinese arms sales in Latin America but China wants to expand

**Tokatlian 18** (Juan Gabriel Tokatlian; Ph.D in International
Relations from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced
International Studies in Washington, D.C.; "No One's Supplanting US
Military Influence in Latin America"; 9/5/2018; Defense One;
<https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/09/no-ones-supplanting-us-military-influence-latin-america/151029/)//>
A.F. + B.T.

Many [U.S. and Latin American experts]{.underline} who analyze
inter-American military relations tend to [repeat two
inaccuracies]{.underline}. First, [they confuse diplomatic statements
and military realities]{.underline}. Second, they [reckon that the
military policies of China, Russia, Iran, and India towards Latin
America are generating a disturbing imbalance that is detrimental to
Washington]{.underline}. The former tendency is exemplified by an
emphasis on then-Secretary of State John Kerry's 2013 speech announcing
[the end of the Monroe
Doctrine](https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/11/217680.htm).
In practice, however, [the Defense Department and]{.underline}
especially U[.S. Southern Command, have reaffirmed their supremacy in
Latin America.]{.underline} The latter tendency requires a bit more
unpacking. There is no doubt that China's economic growth is being
accompanied by an incipient military projection beyond its regional area
of influence, including attempts to boost arms exports to Latin America.
Yet [Bejing's effective military impact upon Latin America]{.underline}
in the region [remains low]{.underline} --- with the exception of its
arms exports to Venezuela. Russia is the region's largest foreign arms
supplier: since 2013, [according to
SIPRI](https://sipri.org/databases/armstransfers), Moscow has supplied
27 percent of the region's imported weapons, more than the United States
(15 percent) and France (10 percent) combined. Meanwhile, military ties
between Iran and Latin America annoy Washington, but Tehran lacks the
capability to ensure its standing or hinder U.S. preeminence in the
region. And as for the limited defense ties between India and Latin
America, Indian specialist Sanjay Badri-Maharaj says it is a farce to
talk about them. In short, [the U.S. military preponderance in the
region]{.underline} persists and it [is rock-solid. No extra-regional
country,]{.underline} individually or jointly, [can challenge U.S.
military clout and control in the region. mong its instruments are U.S.
Southern Command]{.underline}, located in Miami; the [U.S. Navy's Fourth
Fleet]{.underline}, disestablished in 1950 and reassembled in 2008;
military [bases in Cuba and Honduras]{.underline}; cooperative [security
locations in El Salvador and Aruba-Curacao]{.underline}; and [security
assistance organizations]{.underline} in various Latin American
countries. And [while Beijing has sought to implement security
cooperation programs]{.underline} and extend [more invitations to
military courses in China]{.underline}, its [efforts are so far dwarfed
by Washington's]{.underline}: according to the Washington Office on
Latin America: 75 out of 107 U.S. global military assistance programs
are operating in the region, while the [last year]{.underline} alone saw
[5,361 Latin American military and security personnel trained in the
United States. China]{.underline} and Russia are [trying to increase
military-to-military contacts, but the United States has]{.underline}
the National Guard's State Partnership [Program by which 17
states]{.underline}, plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., [have
agreements on security and defense with 23 Latin American countries.
Beijing]{.underline} and Moscow has been [promising material
assistance]{.underline} in the area of defense and security, but it is
[Washington]{.underline} that earlier this year [[pledged \$436
million](https://securityassistance.org/latin-america-and-caribbean) in
military]{.underline} and police [aid,]{.underline} according to data
from Security Assistance Monitor
(https://securityassistance.org/latin-america-and-caribbean) (This year,
the U.S. [sold \$1.3 billion in
arms](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/major-arms-sales-notifications-tracker.html)
to Mexico alone. It is true that Russia has expanded its relationship
with Venezuela, to the point that it now undertakes military exercises
that seriously concern the United States. However, SouthCom conducts
regular, collective joint exercises with countries in Latin America
through drills such as Panamax, UNITAS, Tradewinds and New Horizons. And
U.S. special operations there have drifted upward. Since 2006, the slice
[of U.S. special operators deployed to the region has [risen from 3
percent to 4.39
percent](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176371/tomgram%3A_nick_turse%2C_the_coming_year_in_special_ops/)]{.underline},
according to researcher Nick Turse. In fiscal 2016, the [Special
Operations Command
South](http://www.southcom.mil/About/SOUTHCOM-Components-and-Units/)
conducted several anti-terrorist maneuvers with specialized regional
units in the context of a change of focus from Central America to the
Caribbean (especially with the Dominican Republic and Trinidad and
Tobago) and a growing emphasis on South America (especially Brazil,
Chile and Peru). In 2017, the Army's Special Forces conducted various
exercises with the armed forces of the region: with naval forces from
Central America targeting drug interdiction; with Colombian and Peruvian
units on matters such as drug-trafficking and terrorism, and with
special forces from Chile on urban warfare. In addition, [visits to the
region by U.S. military officials are very frequent]{.underline} and in
some years they have surpassed trips by diplomats. There are some 1,200
uniformed military and civilians dealing with Latin America in SouthCom,
more than the total of officials from various government agencies in
Washington. The [political influence]{.underline} of the military in
inter-American [relations is such that before assuming
their]{.underline} respective [presidencies]{.underline} in Colombia and
Paraguay, [Ivan Duque and Mario Abdo Benitez, visited SouthCom at Doral
Florida]{.underline}. To sum up, the United States remains undoubtedly,
and by far, the primus inter pares on military affairs vis-à-vis Latin
America. The acceptance of the idea, both in Latin America and the
United States, that military policies by China, Russia, and Iran towards
the area are alarming is questionable. [The available evidence does not
support such fear. U.S. military primacy in the Americas is
undeniable.]{.underline}

### L -- Mexico

#### China already finding ways to get weapons to Mexican cartels

**CSIS 18** (Center for Strategic and International Studies; Founded by

Over the past decade, Chinese arm sales to the Americas have grown
modestly. In 2008, China exported a meager \$41 million to countries in
the Western Hemisphere. This number plateaued at \$178 million in 2015
before dropping to \$36 million in 2016. Beijing did not sell any
weapons to the region in 2017. Chinese conventional weapons make up just
3 percent of the combined North and South American arms import market,
which is dominated by the United States (19 percent), Russia (14
percent), and Germany (12 percent).Chinese arms exports in the Americas
are concentrated in Venezuela, which attracted 87.4 percent of Beijing's
regional weapons sales over the last decade. Chinese weapon transfers to
Venezuela did not begin in earnest until after 2006 when the United
States placed an arms embargo against Venezuela for failing to cooperate
in US-led anti-terrorism efforts. Since then Caracas has found a ready
partner as it has sought to upgrade its military in a cost-effective
manner. Notable transactions include the sale of 18 K-8 trainer jets in
2010, 121 VN-4 armored vehicles in 2012, and an undisclosed number of
C-802 anti-ship missiles in 2017. China is now Venezuela's number two
supplier of conventional weapons at 12 percent of the market share; a
position well behind Russia's dominant role as the supplier for 74
percent of Caracas' arms imports. While China's major conventional
weapons sales in the region are limited, China is a provider of small
arms to North America. Prior to 2009, most of these procurements flowed
into Canada, but in recent years Mexico has become a more significant
market. All told, however, China only supplies a fraction of both
country's foreign small arms acquisitions. According to some reports,
Chinese weapons are increasingly finding their way into the hands of
Mexican cartels.

### L -- Middle East

#### China will fill the gap in the region, expanding their geopolitical leverage and diminishing the US

**Al Saud 2018** - graduate student in the Department of Political
Science at Columbia University\
Latifa A, \"China\'s Arms Sales Philosophy in the Arab World,\" Dec 3,
<https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/chinas-arms-sales-philosophy-arab-world>

China's commercial motives do not suggest a complete lack of interest in
influencing the region and maintaining political stability. China is the
world's largest oil [importer of Saudi oil, and as such, stability in
the Middle East is critical to China]{.underline}. [Chinese
arms]{.underline} [sales]{.underline} [to the]{.underline} [region is
arguably motivated to maintain oil flows]{.underline} from friendly
leaders from Arab oil exporting states [and a necessary tool for China
to foster and enhance energy ties.]{.underline} It is no coincidence
that the [major]{.underline} oil [exporting countries]{.underline} in
the region, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran, [are all purchasing
weapons from China]{.underline}. The commercial nature of Chinese arms
sales gives it short-term and long-term advantages. Commercially, [arms
sales not only foster stronger economic ties with Arab states, to which
China remains dependent on their oil exports, but also give China a
chance to ask for a decrease in the cost of importing energy from the
region. China has the ability to use arms sales as leverage to receive
low oil prices]{.underline} and/or concessions, an important tool given
its significant growth in oil demand and dependency on imports. U.S. and
Western policymakers and scholars view increased Chinese arms sales to
the region as not merely economically motivated, but also intended for
China's own power projection and mitigation of U.S. power in the region.
China often criticizes U.S. interference in Middle East affairs,
including the strong presence of U.S. forces in the Gulf (and beyond).
The primary objectives for the US, from China's view, are to maintain,
control, and ensure access to energy resources in the region. [Chinese
actions to cooperate with both U.S. and non-U.S. allies]{.underline},
like Iran and Syria, [are intended to, at least in part, exert its own
influence]{.underline}. In 1991, the Chinese provided Iran with
sophisticated dual use nuclear technology and natural uranium under the
umbrella of nuclear "cooperation." This, among other factors, allowed
China to build up its image as an attractive and easy to deal with arms
provider, serving an entry point to its long-term strategic presence
without appearing to have an interest in picking sides. [Arms sales are
part of China's win-win cooperation and strategy-based foreign
policy]{.underline}. Doing so is a rather unconventional approach to
international arms sales, as they have traditionally been used as a
political tool, with the United States as the top player. [China's
approach can help its long-term strategic posture in the region by
promoting stronger ties with the Arab states, ensuring oil flows, and
opening a door to economic expansion in the Middle East
through]{.underline} investments and Foreign Direct Investments
([FDIs]{.underline}). Although there are no recent instances of China
using arms sales to exert influence in the Middle East, this does not
mean that the commercial nature of Chinese arms sales is not also linked
to national security interests. [The Chinese government's arms exports
philosophy stems from its interest to maintain strategic relations with
the Arab states in order to best increase its prospects for securing its
business and energy interests in the regio]{.underline}n, regardless of
the recipients' country's intensions. [It can therefore be said that PRC
arms sales are exemplified in Xi Jinping's overall win-win,
cooperation-based foreign policy and can in turn have key implications
to understanding the global arms trade of this century.]{.underline}

[[China's donation is part of]{.mark} a [new wave]{.mark} of

history of territorial disputes in the South China Sea.]{.underline}
Beijing's donations so far remain small compared with arms transfers
from the United States, a defense treaty ally with the Philippines since
the 1950s. Washington has in the past five years provided 15 billion
peso (\$282 million) of military aid, including drones, ships,
surveillance planes and assault rifles. Washington and Manila have for
decades held joint exercises, as many as 300 a year, and the programs
remain intact despite repeated threats last year by Duterte to cancel
them and abrogate bilateral defense pacts.

### L -- Saudi Arabia

#### US sales to Riyadh are necessary to pressure them, otherwise China will fill in and green light MBS's adventurism

Technology\
Jonathan D, \"AMERICA'S ARMS SALES POLICY: SECURITY ABROAD, NOT JOBS AT
HOME,\" Apr 6,
https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/americas-arms-sales-policy-security-abroad-not-jobs-at-home/

[A smart arms transfer policy would strangle]{.underline} both Russia,
the number two exporter, and [China, which is trying to take its
place]{.underline}. Russia in particular needs arms exports to fund its
aggressive but underfunded military modernization plans (not to mention
hard currency for its weak economy). It is in America's interests to
choke off as large a percentage of the Russian export market as possible
in favor of the products of more closely aligned countries. In terms of
both American influence and curbing proliferation, it is better for
countries like Malaysia and Indonesia to buy German or South Korean
submarines than Russian. This will have the added benefit of diminishing
the quality and, eventually, raising the price of the products Russia
will export to states, such as Syria, that cannot buy arms from anywhere
else. In the spirit of bolstering potential partners and limiting the
reach of Russian weapons, the United States can directly compete against
Russia in one important market. India accounts for a stunning 39 percent
of Russia's recent arms exports (SIPRI). Indian orders might be big
enough to provide some meaningful economic benefits to the United
States, but more importantly, U.S. sales would cut into Russia's market
share. Tying India and the United States closer, even if it means
allowing most production, jobs, and even some technology transfer to go
abroad, should be a central goal of U.S. arms transfer policy. Lockheed
Martin's offer to transfer the F-16 production line to India appears a
step in this direction. [America should accept that Saudi Arabia is
going to buy a lot of U.S. weapons, but avoid coddling the Kingdom.
Saudi Arabia]{.underline} (and its Gulf State allies) [will remain an
important customer largely because the country is desperate to keep the
United States involved in the region.]{.underline} The Saudi military is
almost entirely American equipped and trained and most of its military
capability requires continued American support to function for more than
a couple of days. A [few additional jobs may result from selling more
arms to the Kingdom, but this may not justify giving up the leverage
over Saudi and its allies' policies towards Yemen, Syria, and Qatar that
do not necessarily advance American interests]{.underline}. The United
States should encourage, but steer, Europe. Since the Cold War the
United States has used its economic and political clout to
systematically inhibit an independent European defense production
capability. This has certainly increased U.S. market share, but
continued efforts come at the expense of more important political goals.
It would be much easier to ask NATO allies to spend 2 percent of their
GDP on defense if more of this money would go into indigenous
industries. The United States should recognize that European global
competitiveness in the arms trade can serve American interests (and
perhaps provide competition for its own sheltered defense industry).
This will relieve pressure on Europe to export to countries embargoed by
the United States, which undermines the influence of U.S. arms transfer
policy. When the United States placed real restrictions on arms
transfers to Egypt's al-Sisi regime, other states quickly attempted to
fill this gap. As one French policymaker cynically noted, "Obama was the
\[French fighter jet\] Rafale's best salesperson." Overall, from
2012-2015 the export agreements of major European sellers to Egypt have
gone up forty-seven-fold over the previous four-year period. That said,
Europe has by and large cooperated with successful arms embargoes
against Russia and China (although Europe does sell nearly \$400 million
of dual use equipment to China each year). Maintaining and even
tightening these key sanctions must be the highest priority of any
defense cooperation policy with Europe. More broadly, fixation on
"buying American" misses tremendous opportunities for leading
coordinated action with like-minded states in Europe and elsewhere. This
is feasible given that the United States, NATO members, South Korea,
Israel, and a few other allies account for a whopping 62 percent of
total global arms exports (SIPRI). To this end, the United States should
liberalize its own market. Much as when "foreign" automotive firms build
their cars in the United States, acquiring products from abroad may
create more jobs than selling weapons internationally. The U.S. Air
Force's current \$16 billion fighter-trainer contract has been largely
narrowed down to three candidates with foreign connections: a Lockheed
Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries version of Korea's T-50; a new design
from a Boeing-Saab team; and an entirely foreign offering from Leonardo.
Winning such a contract will give one of three like-minded states (South
Korea, Sweden, or Italy, respectively) a boost in other international
competitions against less scrupulous dealers. And the United States can
still shape these exports for its political interests, such as when it
recently vetoed the T-50's export to Uzbekistan. America is Like No
Other Arms Exporter and Should Act Like It The United States --- by dint
of its huge military budget, massive defense R&D, and long dominance of
the global arms market --- can use arms transfers in ways beyond the
dreams of its competitors. Indeed, many competitors recognize this,
albeit grudgingly. I have interviewed officials in multiple countries
(both clients and competitors of the United States) claiming they will
defer to U.S. wishes on arms exports if they trust it is done for
political rather than economic reasons. [Many of America's closest
allies, who are also arms export competitors, look to the United States
for leadership on controversial importers such as Saudi
Arabi]{.underline}a. And, the Trump administration should be given due
credit for exercising discretion, given, for instance, its recent
unilateral embargo on arms transfer to South Sudan. In fact, one
administration official stated flatly that sales "will not come at the
expense of human rights." In no small part, [U.S. domination of the
global arms trade is based on the world's belief that the United States
uses its clout to advance its political ends, not economic gain.
Destroying this reputation will do little to bring jobs to the United
States, while doing much to damage American influence
abroad.]{.underline}

NOTE: SALW = Small Arms/ Light Weapons

One of the negative aspects of China's increasing engagement with
African states is the spread of small arms and/or light weapons
especially in conflict zones and \[where\] opposition is violently
suppressed. These [weapons have]{.underline} undoubtably [contributed
to]{.underline} the enhancement of [closer ties between China and
authoritarian regimes and served as an instrument for consolidating its
presence]{.underline} in the continent. China has developed an extensive
presence in Africa through infrastructure such as airports, roads,
hospitals, convention centers, media investment, agricultural and health
education, among many other activities that seemingly put China in a
good light. At the same time many of China's seemingly worthwhile
activities by have not consolidated its ties to the African political
elite and incumbent regimes as much as its arms sales to authoritarian
regimes have. Its positive contributions in the continent have been
offset by the lure of the benefits that are associated with arms sales
to African states despite their negative consequences in growing African
states. [Chinese small arms have been implicated in ethnic violence and
war crimes in Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) among others]{.underline}. They have also been [instrumental in
the suppression of democratic progress in Zimbabwe]{.underline}, and at
the same time expanding its influence and political economic ties with
the authoritarian regime of President Robert Mugabe. China's worldview
which puts social and economic rights over individual liberties and
political rights is often [quick to supply weapons]{.underline} to
authoritarian African states [because it does not make human rights
observance a condition for arms sales]{.underline} to any country.
Incumbent African regimes that face severe threats to their survival are
therefore quick to turn to China as a source of arms supply in the
struggle to preserve their power. Apart from the lure of profits for
China's arms sales to Africa, there is also the added benefit of China
finding employment opportunities for its skilled Chinese citizens. This
contributes to spreading its technical and personnel influence in the
continent. At times, an arms supply relationship also involves
establishing an arms factory in a recipient state that requires the
expertise of skilled Chinese scientists, engineers, and industrial
managers. Such a relationship for China leads to a long term business
and security relationship with the African country. This is one reason
why China's influence in Sudan is so strong. However, what happens is
that weapons that are sold by China or produced by China in Africa end
up fueling and feeding the conflicts in countries such as the DRC,
Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic, among others.
Regime survival or incumbent regime power consolidation efforts fuel
arms transfers in South Sudan and Burundi. Chinese arms are often
implicated in these conflicts because of China's aggressive arms sales
strategy w is based on the following: A "catch all" customers strategy
that has established an arms transfer or military relationship with
several large African states such as Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe,
and South Africa, as well as smaller states like the Republic of Congo,
Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Burundi, and Sierra Leone, among others; A
favorable financing strategy especially for African countries that
cannot afford to buy sophisticated weapons and afford to pay the market
price for small or light weapons; and China's use of frequent and
aggressive small arms marketing of its and more sophisticated military
hardware at annual arms exhibits in various states within the continent.
The wide array of Chinese arms enables China to sell weapons to both
rich authoritarian African states as well as poorer smaller ones. The
Chinese policy of placing no human rights or democracy conditions on
arms sales as well its overall policy of non-interference in the
politics of African states translates into the availability and
affordability of Chinese arms in many African states. The bloody
footprints of China's arm sales in Africa It is not therefore surprising
that arms from China have been implicated in the Ethiopian-Eritrean
conflict in which China is known to have supplied arms to both sides in
the conflict. It is also well documented that Chinese weapons were used
in Sudan's suppression of rebels in Darfur following a revolt in 2003
which led to a genocide against the region's people. It is alleged that
the light weapons used in the massacres in eastern DRC were of Chinese
origin. There, children as young as 11 years old were given weapons by
warlord Thomas Lubanga, and forced to participate in interethnic
killings in the early 2000s. Furthermore, Chinese trained Congolese
troops have been implicated on several occasions in ethnic killings of
innocent civilians in the eastern DRC. Similarly, in 2009
Chinese-trained Guinean Commando units were responsible for the killings
of about 150 people during a protest against authoritarian and
undemocratic rule in the country. According to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI)
[report](http://www.sipriyearook.org/view/9780199695522/sipri-97801996995522.xml)
of 2010, China was found to be the foremost exporter of arms to Africa.
The Chinese Type 56 which is China's version of the Russian Kalashnikov
(AK47) assault rifle is much easier to use as a light weapon. The
argument could be made that in spite of China's claim that it does not
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, the fact that it
supplies weapons to warring factions within a sovereign nation is itself
inherently interventionist by nature. Such interference produces
consequences such as gross human rights violations, murder, rapes,
tortures, and extra-judicial killings. China's arms sales to Africa
attract negative attention especially because they are made available to
states like Sudan and Zimbabwe and the DRC, known for blatant human
rights violations in Africa. This often means that China is reaping the
profits of selling weapons to both incumbent regimes and rebel groups.
The general outcome is the consolidation and expansion of its ties and
presence in the continent. Looking forward: an unsustainable arrangement
China's propensity to spread small arms and light weapons (SALW) among
African states will end up undermining whatever positive perception it
has generated in the continent as well as taint its goals to support
sustainable development and contribute to the national development goals
of individual African states. In particular, it will cast doubt on its
willingness to support Millenium Development Goals, and other specific
development goals in the continent such as the Program for
Infrastructure Development in Africa and similar such programs. So far,
China's military to military ties with African states has been a source
of frustration for the United Nations. While it China contributes to
peacekeeping efforts in the continent, the United Nations does not know
details of its military engagement, or specific military ties, with the
countries in which its peacekeepers are deployed such has the DRC, South
Sudan, Liberia, Mali, among others. In other words, the expanding
military ties with African states, and perhaps the access by rebels to
Chinese arms are factors that are likely to undermine UN peacekeeping
functions of disarmament of ex-combatants. It is difficult to know
whether Chinese arms complement or undermine the efforts to enhance
security in fragile African states. It is a question of whether China is
willing to ensure that its military ties with countries of concern such
as the DRC, Sudan, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe, complement peacekeeping
activities there or help to promote peace, stability, democracy and
development. Human rights
[organizations](https://www.saferworld.org.uk/resources/view-resorce/500-chinas-growing-role-in-african-pece-and-security)
have often called attention to the destabilizing role that Chinese arms
play in conflict zones in Africa. China so far seems determined to
support and forge closer ties with authoritarian regimes in their goals
of power consolidation, oppression of the opposition. China on the other
hand is preoccupied with spreading its influence, consolidating its ties
and deepening its engagement with every African state regardless of
whether it is democratic or authoritarian. Accordingly, Chinese SALWs
are supplied to both national armies in Africa as well as to rebel
groups in the DRC, Chad and Uganda, and now the warring factions in
South Sudan. China's supply of arms to both rebels and national armies
is often a violation of embargoes as well as a blatant case of economic
self-interested behavior. The glimmer of hope in all this is that China
has at times bowed to international pressure to cease supplying weapons
in areas of gross human rights violations such as was the case with
Darfur. But overall China still gives priority to concern over
sovereignty and often defers to incumbent regimes such that human rights
observance and non-proliferation of SALWs are relegated a secondary role
in China's foreign policy rights towards Africa states.

[At least **[46 states imported]{.mark} military [SALW from

from China, with Pakistan and Bangladesh the most prominent recipients,
both of direct deliveries as well as licensed production arrangements
and technology transfers. **[[There has been an increase in]{.mark} the
[quantity]{.mark} and quality of weapons supplied by China [to Latin
America]{.mark} in recent years.]{.underline}** [[In the Middle
East]{.mark}, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Qatar imported SALW from China
in the period 2006--10. [Iran has been a major recipient]{.mark} of
Chinese arms, including SALW, since the 1980--88 Iran--Iraq
War.]{.underline} But in response to concerns that Iran is an important
point of diversion of arms and technology to armed non-state actors and
the illicit market, China is reported to have wound down arms sales to
Iran. There is significant evidence to indicate that [[armed non-state

for greater sharing with China of other states' experiences, policies
and practices with regards to assessments of the risk of diversion,
including unauthorized re-exports. Building on Chinese interest in
developing and implementing robust controls on SALW exports, and given
that there have been a number of cases of Chinese SALW exports being
re-exported without authorization, it could be desirable for states
participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement to consider conducting
outreach to China on its Best Practice Guidelines on Subsequent Transfer
(Re-export) Controls for Conventional Weapons Systems. States could also
share their own experiences and practices in dealing with cases of
unauthorized re-export and in strengthening risk assessment and
post-shipment and delivery measures in this area.

### Arms Sales Key

#### China's sales aren't economic but geopolitical -- the plan gives them a unique opportunity to expand their SOI

(Exports),\" Sep 27,

[Is there something]{.underline} different, something special, [that
distinguishes China's arms export strategy from its Western
counterparts? The answer is]{.underline} a resounding
**[yes]{.underline}**. First and foremost, Western strategists should
not be under any illusion that export revenue is the primary goal.
Rather[, Beijing's end-game is longer-term geo-political and strategic
influence.]{.underline} [The search for regional and global influence is
the critical aim of Chinese economic diplomacy]{.underline}. It reflects
a more narrowly focused aspect of Beijing's soft power framework,
embracing foreign aid, foreign direct investment, overseas educational
programs and, importantly, arms sales. China's arms export model
operates according to a carefully-crafted strategy based on three
principles: promoting the legitimate self-defence capability of the
recipient country; strengthening the peace, security and stability of
that country and region; and non-interference in its internal affairs.
Beijing's long-standing approach of linking non-interference to arms
sales rests on the view that a customer's political, military and human
rights record lies outside the contractual arrangements. [The 'no
questions asked' policy attracts the opprobrium of Western
states]{.underline}, but there is no disputing its effectiveness in
selling guns and securing influence. [The policy particularly appeals to
second- and third-tier military states suffering excessive dependence on
US or Russian weaponry]{.underline}. [Chinese arms offer poorer states
the opportunity to diversify arms sources]{.underline}, regain a degree
of sovereignty over military capability and reduce strategic
vulnerability to arms embargoes. The Chinese arms export model has
several other significant features. From a Chinese strategic
perspective, [it leverages strong client-state relationships and in the
process bolsters Beijing's influence, particularly among neighbouring
states]{.underline}. It is no accident that China's arms sales to
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar indirectly act to contain
the potential threat of Asia's other mega-power, India. Chinese arms are
also competitively packaged. Pricing is low compared to Western models.
Chinese drones, for example, reportedly cost 10--20 per cent of the
near-equivalent US version. Finally, [China is amenable to technology
transfer through defence offset, supporting client states to indigenise
maintenance, repair and overhaul activities and even produce
components.]{.underline} While it may not yet be the dominant player,
[China's arms export strategy has proved effective in taking market
share from competitor nations]{.underline}. [China has also begun to
encroach into higher income markets, especially where technological
sophistication is not required. There is a long-term strategy at work
here, driven by diplomatic and geostrategic objectives,]{.underline} not
commercial gain.

Alexander, \"US needs to sell more weapons as Russia and China fill the
breach,\" Jul 4, The Australian

WORLD COMMENTARY National security is hurt by excessive restrictions
[America's arms-sales policies are too restrictive, leading]{.underline}
even some [pro-US countries to buy weapons from]{.underline} Russia and
[China]{.underline}. This year's National Defence Authorisation Act
would give Defence Secretary Jim Mattis authority to waive certain new
restrictions for specific countries enacted by congress last year. But
the problem is more fundamental[: The US arms-sale regime needs to be
recalibrated to protect American influence in a highly competitive
geopolitical environment]{.underline}. The US government blocks weapons
sales to foreign countries for various reasons. Congress is often wary
of selling arms to countries that could use them to undermine civil
liberties. The Defence Department often worries the purchasing country
could allow sensitive US technology to fall into the wrong hands. The
State Department arms-control bureau has a general aversion to any
weapons proliferation on grounds that it could trigger an arms race.
These are valid concerns. [But as Russia and China actively pursue
weapons sales as part of an aggressive strategy to expand their spheres
of influence, US strategic interests must be given more
weight.]{.underline} Over the past decade, Russia has easily maintained
its position as the world's second-largest weapons supplier, comprising
22 per cent of global sales from 2013-17[. Chinese arms exports
increased by nearly 40 per cent from 2013-17 compared with the previous
four years,]{.underline} the largest increase for any large exporter
country except Israel, according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. [Neither Russia nor China has qualms about selling
weapons to even brazen human-rights violators]{.underline}. In fact
[they often provide the technologies authoritarian governments use to
surveil and repress their citizens.]{.underline} And they are especially
eager to peel off countries the US has declined to arm. Russia sells
aircraft, submarines, anti-aircraft systems and missiles. China has made
strides in advanced missile systems as well as unmanned aerial vehicles.
The sale of these sophisticated weapons poses a direct threat to US
security interests. It also creates challenges around interoperability.
Technologies developed by the Russians and Chinese --- such as advanced
radars, sonars, sensors and communications platforms --- cannot
integrate effectively with US technologies. [The more a country
purchases from Russia or China, the less able it is to purchase from the
US in the future, pushing a country further out of America's security
orbit]{.underline}. [The lack of interoperability would also present
major obstacles if the US needed to fight a war alongside an ally whose
advanced military equipment had been sourced from Russia or
China]{.underline}.

For now[, the United States remains the dominant power in East Asia, but
China is]{.underline} quickly [closing the gap]{.underline}. Although an
economic crisis or domestic political turmoil could derail China's rise,
if current trends continue, China will before long supplant the United
States as the region's economic, military, and political hegemon. As
that day approaches, U.S. allies and partners in the region, such as
Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea, will start to face
some difficult questions. Namely, should they step up their individual
defense efforts and increase their cooperation with other countries in
the region, or can they safely decide to accept Chinese dominance,
looking to Beijing as they have looked to Washington for the past half
century? I[t may be tempting to believe that China will be
a]{.underline} relatively [benign]{.underline} regional
[hegemon.]{.underline} Economic interdependence, one argument goes,
should restrain Chinese aggression: because the legitimacy of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rests on economic growth, which depends on
trade, Beijing would maintain peaceful relations with its neighbors.
Moreover, China claims to be a different sort of great power. Chinese
officials and scholars regularly decry interventionism and reject the
notion of "spheres of influence" as a Cold War relic. Chinese President
Xi Jinping has said that his country has "never engaged in colonialism
or aggression" thanks to its "peace-loving cultural tradition." In this
view, life in China's Asia would not be so different from what it is
today. [But this is not how]{.underline} regional [hegemons behave.
Great powers]{.underline} typically [dominate their regions in their
quest for security.]{.underline} They [develop and wield]{.underline}
tremendous [economic power.]{.underline} They [build massive militaries,
expel external rivals, and]{.underline} use regional institutions and
cultural programs to [entrench their influence]{.underline}. Because
hegemons fear that neighboring countries will allow external rivals to
establish a military foothold, they [develop a profound interest in the
domestic politics of their neighborhood]{.underline}, and even seek to
spread their culture to draw other countries closer. [China is already
following the strategies of previous]{.underline} regional [hegemons. It
is using economic coercion to bend other countries to its
will]{.underline}. It is [building up its military to ward off
challengers.]{.underline} It is [intervening in other
countries']{.underline} domestic [politics]{.underline} to get
friendlier policies. And it is investing massively in educational and
cultural programs to enhance its soft power. As Chinese power and
ambition grow, such efforts will only increase. China's neighbors must
start debating how comfortable they are with this future, and what costs
they are willing to pay to shape or forestall it. ECONOMIC CENTRALITY
Over the past few decades, [China has become the number one trading
partner]{.underline} and principal export destination [for most
countries in East Asia.]{.underline} Beijing has [struck a number
of]{.underline} regional [economic deals]{.underline}, including
free-trade agreements with Australia, Singapore, South Korea, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and others. Through such
arrangements, [which exclude the United States]{.underline}, Beijing
seeks to create a Chinese-dominated East Asian community. Beijing is
also [building an institutional infrastructure to increase its influence
at the expense of U.S.-led institutions]{.underline}, such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, [and Japanese-led
ones]{.underline}, such as the Asian Development Bank. In 2014, China,
along with Brazil, Russia, and India, set up the \$100 billion New
Development Bank, which is headquartered in Shanghai. In 2015, China
founded the \$100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which 80
countries have now joined. Furthermore, [Xi's much-heralded Belt and
Road initiative will promote Chinese trade]{.underline} and financial
cooperation throughout the region [and provide]{.underline} massive
[Chinese investment in]{.underline} regional [infrastructure and natural
resources]{.underline}. The China Development Bank has already committed
\$250 billion in loans to the project. Such policies [mimic the economic
strategies of previous regional hegemons.]{.underline} China was the
predominant economic and military power in East Asia until the
nineteenth century. It granted or withheld trade privileges according to
an elaborate system of tribute, in which other countries had to send
diplomatic missions, bestow gifts, and kowtow to the Chinese emperor.
The Chinese then determined the prices and quantities of all goods
traded. Imperial China consolidated its economic power by investing in
agriculture and railroads, extracting minerals, and encouraging close
commercial integration throughout the region. [In Latin America, the
United States followed the same playbook]{.underline} to establish
itself as the region's central economic player. In the nineteenth
century, American firms flocked to the region in search of fruit,
minerals, sugar, and tobacco. The U.S. company United Fruit managed to
gain control of the entire fruit export trade in Central America.
[Finance was another powerful tool]{.underline}; as the Uruguayan
journalist Eduardo Galeano has argued, [a U.S. "banking
invasion"]{.underline} diverted local capital to U.S. firms. Washington
encouraged American banks to assume the debts of European creditors to
minimize the influence of European rivals. For almost 100 years,
Washington used diplomacy to advance its economic interests through
initiatives promoting U.S. regional trade and investment, such as the
Big Brother policy in the 1880s, "dollar diplomacy" in the early 1900s,
and the Alliance for Progress in the 1960s. The [United States also
built a regional institutional architecture]{.underline} to advance its
agenda. In 1948, it created [the Organization of American
States]{.underline} (headquartered in Washington, D.C.) [to promote
regional security and cooperation]{.underline}. American influence
ensured that the OAS remained silent on, or even legitimized, various
U.S. military and political interventions in Latin America. Other
development institutions, including the IMF, the World Bank, the
Inter-American Development Bank, the U.S. Agency for International
Development, and the Export-Import Bank of the United States, also
advanced U.S. interests. Through "tied aid," such organizations required
sponsored projects to hire U.S. vendors. The IMF, as Galeano has argued,
was "born in the United States, headquartered in the United States, and
at the service of the United States." Another regional hegemon, [Japan,
pursued similar strategies]{.underline} in its empire that dominated the
region in the early twentieth century. Vowing to eject the Western
colonial powers, Tokyo declared itself the head of a "Greater East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere." To feed its industrial economy and military,
[Tokyo extracted raw materials from countries it conquered]{.underline}.
To promote Japan's centrality, and to prevent economic activities by
rival countries, it reformed and managed local economies in a regional
network, [standardizing the]{.underline} region's currency in a ["yen
bloc" and dispatching Japanese banks]{.underline} throughout the area so
that they controlled the majority of the region's bank deposits. Tokyo
also created the Southern Development Bank, which provided financial
services and printed currency in occupied territories. Economic
dominance lets regional hegemons use economic coercion to advance their
agendas. Similarly, in Eastern Europe after World War II, the Soviet
Union relied on economic and financial statecraft to dominate the
region. Moscow blocked all trade with Western Europe and forbade Eastern
European states from accepting aid under the 1948 Marshall Plan.
Instead, it created the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance to manage
and integrate the regional economy. Soviet investment, trade agreements,
and trade credits made Eastern European countries economically dependent
on Moscow, both as their primary export market and as their supplier of
raw materials and energy. And by selling raw materials at below-market
prices, [Moscow encouraged local political leaders to become dependent
on its subsidies. **Economic dominance lets regional hegemons use
economic coercion to advance their agendas.**]{.underline} In Latin
America, the United States has long sought to coerce countries through
sanctions. In addition to the long-standing (and failed) U.S. embargo of
Cuba, Washington used financial pressure to weaken President Salvador
Allende in Chile in the 1970s and embargoed Nicaragua to undermine the
Sandinista government in 1985. Similarly, in Eastern Europe, Moscow
sought to control independent-minded leaders, imposing sanctions against
Yugoslavia in 1948, Albania in 1961, and Romania in 1964. [Beijing has
already begun to employ such economic coercion]{.underline}. In 2017,
China punished South Korea and the Japanese--South Korean business
conglomerate Lotte for cooperating with the U.S.-built THAAD missile
defense program. (Lotte had sold the land on which THAAD was deployed to
the South Korean government.) Beijing banned Chinese tour groups from
visiting South Korea, Chinese regulators closed 80 percent of Lotte
supermarkets and other Korean-owned businesses (ostensibly for fire-code
violations), and state-run media urged boycotts of Korean products.
Beijing has also used economic coercion against Japan (banning the
export of Chinese rare-earth metals to the country after a 2009 ship
collision) and Norway (embargoing Norwegian fish exports after the
Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010). And in
2016, when Mongolia hosted the Dalai Lama, Beijing imposed extra fees on
commodities moving through the country and froze all diplomatic
activity---including negotiations about a \$4 billion Chinese loan. "We
hope that Mongolia has taken this lesson to heart," the Chinese foreign
ministry said in a statement. Apparently it has: the Mongolian
government has announced that the spiritual leader will not be invited
back. Such coercion will be less necessary in the future as leaders
preemptively adjust their policies with Beijing in mind. [Consider the
Philippines]{.underline}: in the past, [the country has stood up to
China]{.underline}---for example, filing a complaint about Chinese
territorial assertiveness with an international tribunal at The Hague in
2013. [But]{.underline} more recently, Philippine President Rodrigo
[Duterte, who has received \$24 billion]{.underline} in investment
pledges from Beijing, [has warmed relations]{.underline} with China and
distanced his country from the United States. **[Following the example
of previous hegemons, China is also expanding its regional military
reach.]{.underline}** Since the 1990s, [Chinese military spending has
soared]{.underline}, and the [CCP is modernizing weaponry]{.underline}
and [reforming its military organizations and doctrine. The People's
Liberation Army]{.underline} (PLA) has [adopted the doctrine of
"anti-access, area denial" to push the U.S. military away from its
shores and airspace]{.underline}. China has also built the region's
largest coast guard and controls a vast militia of civilian fishing
vessels. In 2017, the [PLA opened its first overseas military base in
Djibouti]{.underline}; it will [likely build more bases]{.underline}
along the African east coast and the Indian Ocean in coming years.
Meanwhile, in the South China Sea, [China has built six large islands
that house air force bases, missile shelters, and radar]{.underline} and
communications [facilities]{.underline}. Already, the U[.S. military
finds itself constrained by]{.underline} the expanding bubble of
[Chinese air defenses]{.underline}, by China's growing ability to find
and strike U.S. naval vessels, and by an increased missile threat to
U.S. air bases and ports. **[Beijing is using these capabilities to more
forcefully assert its territorial claims.]{.underline}** By [transiting
disputed waters and massing ships]{.underline} there, Beijing is
[pressuring Japan]{.underline} militarily [over]{.underline} a cluster
of small islands called the Diaoyu by China and the
[Senkaku]{.underline} by Japan. Elsewhere, to deny access to disputed
areas, the PLA [swarms fishing and coast guard vessels]{.underline}, and
[fires water cannons at other]{.underline} countries'
[ships]{.underline}. Last summer, after [asserting ownership of an
oil-rich area in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone, Beijing threatened
to use military force]{.underline} if Vietnam did not stop drilling.
[Vietnam stopped drilling]{.underline}. Contemporary China's quest for
regional military dominance follows the behavior of previous regional
hegemons, including China itself. As the historian Peter Perdue has
argued, [modern China is a product of invasions that
subdued]{.underline} all of modern [Xinjiang]{.underline} and [Mongolia,
and]{.underline} reached [Tibet]{.underline}, as well. Chinese
dynasties, he has written, "never shrank from the use of force,"
including the "righteous extermination" of rival states and rebels.
Throughout Asia, Chinese military garrisons subdued invaders and
pirates. [Subsequent hegemons dominated their regions through military
force]{.underline}, too. Starting in the late nineteenth century, the
United States began to build what would become the Western Hemisphere's
preeminent military. In that period, the [United States acquired
territory through]{.underline} numerous [wars]{.underline} against
Mexico and Spain. Over the next few decades (often to advance the United
States' commercial interests), [U.S. forces invaded Latin American
countries more than 20 times]{.underline}, most often the [Dominican
Republic, Haiti, Mexico, and Nicaragua]{.underline}. During the Cold
War, the United States repeatedly used military force to counter leftist
movements in Latin America: it blockaded Cuba in 1962, sent troops to
the Dominican Republic in 1965, mined Nicaraguan harbors in the 1980s,
and invaded Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989. [Japan also built and
maintained its empire through military force]{.underline}. Its
nineteenth-century military modernization yielded stunning victories
over China and Russia. Through these and other military campaigns, Japan
seized territories such as Korea and Taiwan and wrested colonial
possessions from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. The Japanese military then administered the empire, fighting
counterinsurgencies and suppressing independence movements. In Europe
after World War II, the [Soviet Union dominated its sphere of influence
with the region's most powerful army]{.underline}. It stationed troops
in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, and Poland. To shape the
region to its liking, the Kremlin was willing to use force. It
dispatched Soviet troops to quell uprisings in Hungary in 1956 and
Czechoslovakia in 1968. These [hegemons did not tolerate the presence of
rival great powers in their regions]{.underline}. Likewise,
[China]{.underline} today [is chafing against the U.S. presence in
Asia]{.underline} and actively working to undermine it. Chinese
officials and defense white papers criticize U.S. alliances as outdated
and destabilizing. [Xi]{.underline} himself, calling for a new "Asian
security architecture[," has argued that these relationships fail to
address the region's]{.underline} complex [security needs]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, by cultivating close ties with Seoul and encouraging the
Philippines' tilt toward China, Beijing has sought to draw U.S allies
away. NOSY NEIGHBOR [Beijing is also interfering in the domestic
politics of other countries]{.underline}. Citing China specifically,
Canadian intelligence officials have warned of [foreign
agents]{.underline} who might be [serving as provincial cabinet
ministers and government employees]{.underline}. And in 2016, a scandal
erupted in Australia after it was revealed that Sam Dastyari, a
[senator]{.underline} who [had]{.underline} defended Chinese territorial
claims in the South China Sea, had [financial ties to a Chinese
firm]{.underline}, prompting new laws banning foreign political
donations. Historically, regional hegemons have intervened extensively
in domestic politics to support friendly governments and undermine
parties and leaders perceived as hostile. Within China's tribute system,
the emperor delegated the administration of subservient states to local
leaders, an approach known as "using barbarians to govern barbarians."
But local independence went only so far. As the sixteenth-century
statesman Chang Chu-cheng said of such vassals, "Just like dogs, if they
wag their tails, bones will be thrown to them; if they bark wildly, they
will be beaten with sticks; after the beating, if they submit again,
bones will be thrown to them again; after the bones, if they bark again,
then more beating." [Japan similarly intervened in domestic politics
during its imperial heyday]{.underline}. In the Philippines, for
example, [it abolished all political parties except for the pro-Japanese
one]{.underline}. Elsewhere, it delegated control to friendly local
leaders and police, and trained such leaders at institutes in Japan. If
officials in China, Korea, and Manchuria did not cooperate, Tokyo relied
on a Japanese paramilitary organization that intimidated, blackmailed,
and assassinated local leaders. For its part, [the United States meddled
in Latin American politics countless times]{.underline}. Through the
Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, [Washington]{.underline}
claimed the right to intervene in its neighbors' affairs. It [relied on
covert]{.underline} and overt, [violent]{.underline} and nonviolent
[methods to support anticommunist leaders]{.underline} and to undermine
or depose leftist ones. The U.S. diplomat Robert Olds explained the
approach in blunt terms in 1927: "Central America has always understood
that governments which we recognize and support stay in power, while
those which we do not recognize and support fall." During the Cold War,
the U.S. military and the CIA funded, armed, and trained anticommunist
forces throughout Latin America at institutions such as the U.S. Army
School of the Americas in Panama. U.S.-trained forces sought to depose
leftist governments in Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.
Washington also supported coups in Guatemala in 1954 and Chile in 1973.
[Moscow was similarly busy in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. After World
War II, the Soviet Union installed communist parties in its neighbors'
governments, in which advancement depended on loyalty to Moscow. Under
Stalin, Soviet secret police harassed, tortured, and murdered opposition
leaders. After Stalin, the Soviets relied on subtler tactics, such as
bringing foreign elites to train in communist party schools and to build
networks with Soviet and regional politicians. Through the Brezhnev
Doctrine, Moscow claimed the authority to intervene in its neighbors'
politics in order to defend socialism from hostile forces.

### Zero-Sum

#### US and China use arms sales to compete for influence, it's 0 sum -- exhaustive study of sales between 2008 and 2017

**Huang 18** (Kristen Huang; Journalist at SCMP citing SIPRI; "China's
arms sales rise as it vies with US for influence on the world stage";
3/12/2018; South China Morning Post, Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute;
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2136877/chinas-arms-sales-rise-it-vies-us-influence-world-stage)//Garfield-Ben

The rivalry between [America and China]{.underline} has seen both sides
[step up]{.underline} international [arms sales]{.underline} and
transfers as they seek [to strengthen military ties with]{.underline}
key [allies]{.underline}, according to a report published on Monday.
[The study]{.underline} by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI), which [examined the volume of international
transfers]{.underline} of major weapons [between 2008 and
2017]{.underline}, showed China's arms exports represented 5.7 per cent
of the world's share of arms exports between 2013-17 -- up by more than
a third from the 4.6 per cent recorded between 2008-12. The report was
published a week after China unveiled an 8.1 per cent increase in
military spending over a three-year period, although China's state media
defended the rise as proportionate and low, adding that it would not
lead to an arms race with the United States. The administration of US
President Donald Trump has dubbed China as a "rival", and the latest
SIPRI report shows how [the US has used arms transfers]{.underline} as a
foreign policy tool [to offset Beijing's growing influence]{.underline}.
For example, [US arms deliveries to India grew by 557 per
cent]{.underline} between 2008 and 2017, [the year China and India
became embroiled in a]{.underline} protracted [border
dispute]{.underline} over the Doklam region in the Himalayas. "This
development is part of the growing strategic partnership between the two
countries under which the USA has begun to supply India with advanced
military equipment," the report said. The [US]{.underline} has also
[started to increase its security cooperation with Vietnam, which is
embroiled in a dispute with Beijing over the South China
Sea]{.underline}. [In 2017 it delivered one patrol ship]{.underline},
the USS Morgenthau, to Vietnam -- [the first major US arms transfer to
that country.]{.underline} [Tensions between China and
Japan]{.underline} in the East China Sea also [saw Japan moving closer
to the US]{.underline}, the report said. It said [Tokyo turned to the US
for several types of advanced weapons]{.underline} between 2013 and
2017, including the first batches of a total of 42 combat aircraft.
Japan also ordered advanced air and missile defence systems from the US
in the same period. But in [cases where US relations]{.underline} with
other countries had [deteriorated the result was a fall in arms
transfers.]{.underline} For example, the report said that
[Venezuela]{.underline}, which [once relied on the US as its main arms
supplier]{.underline}, [had rebuilt its armed forces with weapons from
China]{.underline} and Russia [after ties with Washington
soured]{.underline} following the Hugo Chavez's election as president in
1999. [As China became]{.underline} increasingly [capable of producing
its own advanced weapons]{.underline}, its arms [exports increased by 38
per cent]{.underline} and its arms imports decreased by 19 per cent in
2013-2017 compared with 2008-2012. The report showed [China
delivered]{.underline} major [arms to 48 countries]{.underline} in the
past five years, with [Pakistan]{.underline} topping the list, followed
by [Bangladesh and Algeria.]{.underline} "China was the largest arms
supplier to Pakistan in 2008--12 and 2013--17. Although the volume of
China's arms exports to Pakistan remained roughly the same in both
periods, its share of Pakistan's arms imports rose from 45 per cent in
2008--12 to 70 per cent in 2013--17 due to the overall decrease in
Pakistan's arms imports between those periods," the report stated. The
report also said China's arms exports to Africa rose by 55 per cent over
the period. Military expert Collin Koh, from the S Rajaratnam School of
International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore,
said higher value military items like warships and fighter jets were the
major reason for the rise in China's arms exports. "This is most notable
in naval sales. For example, submarines to Pakistan and Thailand, and
corvettes to Bangladesh and Algeria. Even with land-based systems, China
has also made inroads in higher value sales, such as its long-range
rocket artillery," he said.

#### Interoperability issues guarantee that the weapons distribution is zero-sum

Alexander, \"US needs to sell more weapons as Russia and China fill the
breach,\" Jul 4, The Australian

WORLD COMMENTARY National security is hurt by excessive restrictions
[America's arms-sales policies are too restrictive, leading]{.underline}
even some [pro-US countries to buy weapons from]{.underline} Russia and
[China]{.underline}. This year's National Defence Authorisation Act
would give Defence Secretary Jim Mattis authority to waive certain new
restrictions for specific countries enacted by congress last year. But
the problem is more fundamental[: The US arms-sale regime needs to be
recalibrated to protect American influence in a highly competitive
geopolitical environment]{.underline}. The US government blocks weapons
sales to foreign countries for various reasons. Congress is often wary
of selling arms to countries that could use them to undermine civil
liberties. The Defence Department often worries the purchasing country
could allow sensitive US technology to fall into the wrong hands. The
State Department arms-control bureau has a general aversion to any
weapons proliferation on grounds that it could trigger an arms race.
These are valid concerns. [But as Russia and China actively pursue
weapons sales as part of an aggressive strategy to expand their spheres
of influence, US strategic interests must be given more
weight.]{.underline} Over the past decade, Russia has easily maintained
its position as the world's second-largest weapons supplier, comprising
22 per cent of global sales from 2013-17[. Chinese arms exports
increased by nearly 40 per cent from 2013-17 compared with the previous
four years,]{.underline} the largest increase for any large exporter
country except Israel, according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. [Neither Russia nor China has qualms about selling
weapons to even brazen human-rights violators]{.underline}. In fact
[they often provide the technologies authoritarian governments use to
surveil and repress their citizens.]{.underline} And they are especially
eager to peel off countries the US has declined to arm. Russia sells
aircraft, submarines, anti-aircraft systems and missiles. China has made
strides in advanced missile systems as well as unmanned aerial vehicles.
The sale of these sophisticated weapons poses a direct threat to US
security interests. It also creates challenges around interoperability.
Technologies developed by the Russians and Chinese --- such as advanced
radars, sonars, sensors and communications platforms --- cannot
integrate effectively with US technologies. [The more a country
purchases from Russia or China, the less able it is to purchase from the
US in the future, pushing a country further out of America's security
orbit]{.underline}. [The lack of interoperability would also present
major obstacles if the US needed to fight a war alongside an ally whose
advanced military equipment had been sourced from Russia or
China]{.underline}. [Countries cut off by the US will still be able to
purchase advanced systems]{.underline}. Worse, [they will be able to do
so without depending on the US for maintenance, ammunition or spare
parts]{.underline}. [This eliminates a key lever for US influence in the
event that human-rights abuses occur]{.underline}, for instance.

Andy, \"China willing to do whatever it can to surpass the U.S.
military,\" Jun 9,
https://warisboring.com/china-willing-to-do-whatever-it-can-to-surpass-the-u-s-military/

[The Chinese military is reportedly close to achieving technological
parity with the United States, just one step in China's plan to achieve
global dominance]{.underline}. [According to a report by former deputy
defense secretary]{.underline} Robert Work, [the Chinese are looking to
surpass the United States and keep them trailing behind at all
costs.]{.underline} "The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been
patiently stalking the US military for two decades," the report read.
"It has studied the preferred American way of war and devised a strategy
to exploit its weaknesses and offset its strengths- particularly its
military-technological strengths." Work added that [China "appears
increasingly close to achieving technological parity with U.S.
operational systems and has a plan to achieve technological
superiority]{.underline}." China's plan to push the U.S. off of its
pedestal began in the late 1990s and early 2000s, though actual catching
up took longer than expected. According to Newsweek, [China has largely
relied upon industrial and technical espionage to establish some form of
equal footing with the US, though some innovation has been
home-grown]{.underline}. China's military budget is the world's second
largest, trailing behind the USA but with more focus on materials.
"Every day we wait, we fall farther and farther behind," Work said.

<https://chinapower.csis.org/china-global-arms-trade/)//Garfield-Ben>

For most of the 1980s and 1990s, weapons sales to Africa represented
less than 15 percent of its total arms exports. As China has worked to
expand its foothold in the region, this number has grown. Since 2008,
countries in Africa collectively purchased around 21 percent (\$3
billion since 2008) of China's overall arms exports. Northern African
countries are the primary destination of Chinese weapons, constituting
42 percent of Chinese exports to the continent. An additional 29 percent
flows into to Eastern Africa, and the remaining 29 percent are divided
between other African states. This relatively wide market distribution
is somewhat unusual for major arms traders. Of the \$4.9 billion of US
arms exported to Africa over the last decade, roughly 87 percent were
purchased by Egypt and Morocco. Similarly, Algeria and Egypt accounted
for 84 percent of Russian arms transfers in Africa over the same period.
In terms of trade value, Russia leads the pack at \$12.4 billion in
sales since 2008. The US tallied less than half of that at \$4.9
billion, while China sold around \$3 billion. That said, [Chinese
weaponry]{.underline} is becoming increasingly [attractive
due]{.underline} in part [to its cost-effectiveness]{.underline}.
Although Chinese arms are often less advanced than those sold by other
countries, [the DOD notes that "Chinese arms are less expensive than
those offered by the top international arms suppliers... \[but still\]
have advanced capabilities."]{.underline} For example, [the low-cost K-8
jet]{.underline} trainer is estimated to [make up 80 percent of all
jet]{.underline} trainer [aircraft in Africa. China is
actively]{.underline} [working to strengthen its foothold in certain
markets]{.underline}, such as Algeria. China's exports to the North
African country totaled \$483 million between 2008 and 2014, but jumped
to \$247 million in 2015 alone and peaked at \$499 million in 2016 as
several weapon orders were fulfilled. These [procurements included three
C-28A frigates]{.underline}, which were ordered by Algeria in 2012.

Unlike most other regions where China is a net exporter of arms, Europe
presents a different story. More than [99 percent of
China's]{.underline} total [arms imports]{.underline} (\$12.8 billion[)
come from Europe]{.underline}, while it exports a paltry \$16 million of
its own weapons to the continent. This trend is [driven by]{.underline}
and large by [Russia]{.underline}, which supplies China with 67 percent
of foreign arms. France and Ukraine collectively supply an additional 23
percent of these imports. Historically [Russian arms have poured over
the border]{.underline} to China, [but]{.underline} this [trend is
shifting]{.underline}. Russian arms sales to China averaged [\$2.5
billion]{.underline} through the 2000s until 2006, but this figure
[dropped to around 900 million]{.underline} in recent years. This
downturn has reduced the market share of Russian arms exports obtained
by China from 47.7 percent of total sales in 2006 to 8.7 percent in
2012. Historically Russian arms have poured over the border to China,
but this trend is shifting. Russian arms sales to China averaged \$2.5
billion through the 2000s until 2006, but this figure dropped to around
900 million in recent years. This downturn has reduced the market share
of Russian arms exports obtained by China from 47.7 percent of total
sales in 2006 to 8.7 percent in 2012. [This trend reflects China's
growing capability to domestically produce weapons**, which in many
cases has been supported by the successful reverse engineering of
existing technology. For instance, the Shenyang J-11 fighter was adopted
from the Russia Su-27k that Beijing first purchased in 1992. It has been
suggested that China's HQ-9 surface-to-air missiles were inspired by
Russia's S-300 platform.**]{.underline} China's economic growth has also
contributed to this shift. [China spends more on research and
development than any other country]{.underline} except the United
States. The nature of Chinese arms imports is also changing. Whereas in
the past China procured entire weapons systems, it is increasingly
purchasing specific components that can be outfitted on platforms
designed and built at home. Of particular note is China's longstanding
need to acquire foreign engines to counterbalance its struggles to
indigenously produce them. Between 2012 and 2016, China purchased over
420 aircraft engines from Russia, along with four Sukhoi Su-35s. This
represents a reversal from 1997 to 2001 when China bought only four
engines but 79 finished aircraft from Russia.

China is actively working to strengthen its foothold in certain markets,
such as Algeria. China's exports to the North African country totaled
\$483 million between 2008 and 2014, but jumped to \$247 million in 2015
alone and peaked at \$499 million in 2016 as several weapon orders were

ordered by Algeria in 2012. [Although not a member of the Missile
Technology Control Regime]{.underline}, a non-proliferation agreement
targeted at missiles and systems capable of delivery weapons of mass
destruction, [Beijing is]{.underline} generally [compliant with
international protocols. The 2002 Regulations on the Export Control of
Missiles and Missile-related Items and Technologies]{.underline}, for
instance, [outlines measures to safeguard against
proliferation]{.underline}. In June 2017, [China published a draft of
the Export Control Law, which]{.underline} if enacted [will update
existing legislation and establish a comprehensive export control
regime. Beijing]{.underline} has been [quick to adapt its domestic
regulations to]{.underline} account for [emerging
technology]{.underline}. This has enabled it to fill the void left by
other suppliers. The US, which has long been at the forefront of
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) development, has purposely restricted the
export of its UAVs. Regulations that until recently characterized
long-range unmanned aerial systems as cruise missiles, have also limited
overseas access of American UAVs. These factors have created a ripe
market opportunity for China, which has made its UAVs available to
countries such as Nigeria and Egypt.

[China dismissed the possibility of entering into negotiations for a
trilateral arms control deal alongside the United States and
Russia]{.underline}, highlighting that the U.S. had failed to uphold its
international commitments. At a news briefing Monday, [Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang warned of \"growing instabilities and
uncertainties]{.underline} in the field of international strategic
security,\" specifically [pointing out how a \"certain major country has
withdrawn from one international treaty and mechanism after another
while building up its own nuclear and missile power.\"]{.underline} The
remarks came as President Donald Trump attempted to get Beijing to join
new non-proliferation agreements as Washington had abandoned previous
agreements with Moscow. Lu argued that [such moves \"impacted global
stability, eroded strategic mutual trust between major countries and
weakened international arms control mechanism.\"]{.underline} He said
that \"[China and Russia both believe that they need to strengthen the
planning of strategic cooperation, adhere to multilateralism, firmly
check the negative tendency and resist the harm of

arms control, China\'s position is clear-cut]{.underline},\" Lu added.
\"[The premise and basis for trilateral arms control negotiations do not
exist at all, and China will never participate in them.\"]{.underline}
In February, the White House withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, a measure that banned the U.S. and Russia
from deploying land-based missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,420
miles. Washington argued that Moscow\'s Novator 9M729 missile violated
the agreement\'s restrictions, while Russian officials rejected this and
counterclaimed that the Pentagon\'s own Aegis Ashore defense system in
Eastern Europe could be used offensively, thus violating the treaty.
Though China was not a party to the agreement, Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Geng Shuang called the U.S. move \"regrettable\" at the
time and warned it could \"trigger a series of adverse consequences.\"
Asked if China would join a new INF, Geng said such a move \"involves a
series of complex issues covering political, military and legal fields,
which draws concerns from many countries\" and \"what is imperative at
the moment is to uphold and implement the existing treaty instead of
creating a new one.\" Since then, the [Trump administration suggested it
might also consider letting the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START) expire]{.underline} and instead seek a three-way arrangement
with Moscow and Beijing. The New START is itself a sequel to the
original START treaty signed in 1991 by the U.S. and Soviet Union, and
expanded on restrictions to both countries\' nuclear arsenals.

Conflict between a rising power and an established power is not

relationship, [there is a tipping point]{.underline} or a point of no
return, [and China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [are

powers have been increasingly relying on their military capabilities and
hard power tactics. That's especially true [in [the
S]{.mark}]{.underline}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea, which [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one of
[[the]{.mark} single [greatest]{.mark} points of
[contention]{.mark}]{.underline} between China and the United States.
While there is a realization on both sides of the Pacific that a kind of
strategic stability is necessary to prevent great power conflict, [both
[China and the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[remain unwilling to compromise]{.underline} [and make
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [kind of meaningful [concessions required to
move the relationship further from confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}
and conflict and closer to cooperation and rapprochement. Instead, these
two countries are drawing lines in the sand and preparing for the worst.
Failed pursuit of strategic stability China's proposed solution to the
Sino-American strategic stability issue is the "new model of
major-country relations," which encourages the United States and China
to avoid confrontation and conflict, respect one another's political
systems and national interests---specifically China's core
interests---and pursue win-win cooperation. China is exceptionally
enthusiastic about this proposal and brings it up at every high-level
Sino-American meeting. Chinese enthusiasm for the "new model of
major-country relations" can be explained in a number of different ways.
[[American acceptance of China's proposal would]{.mark} facilitate
Beijing's rise[, legitimize the]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese Communist
Party [([CCP) as a leader]{.underline}]{.mark} [for national strength
and revival and reduce the likelihood of American
containment]{.underline}. As acceptance of the "new model of
major-country relations" would create an international environment
conducive to China's rise, it would essentially allow China to become
the preeminent power in Asia without great power competition or
conflict. This proposal also has the potential to put China on par with
the United States, to elevate it to an equal status, one acknowledged by
the United States. [Not only would American recognition of China's
strength and power have effects abroad, but [it would also **stoke
Chinese nationalism and strengthen CCP leadership at
home**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, this new model is a means of
establishing a new code of conduct for the Sino-American relationship
that is more in line with Chinese national interests, opening the door
for the creation of a Chinese sphere of influence in Asia and,
potentially, a Sino-centric regional order. Prior to the recent meeting
between Xi Jinping and Barack Obama, Xi announced that China's proposed
"new model of major-country-relations" would be an important discussion
point for the meeting, but, while this proposal was brought up during
the meeting, no clear progress was made. Because U.S. leaders believe
that the "new model of major-country relations" is not in America's best
interests, the United States has repeatedly dismissed China's proposal.
As the hegemonic power, the United States maintains its power by
dominating global politics; to accept a geopolitical framework
alternative proposed by a strategic rival requires sacrificing a certain
amount of power and influence. Along those same lines, [acceptance of
[China's proposal might give other states]{.mark} in the international
system [the impression that the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is in decline and on the losing end of
the classic "Thucydides trap."]{.mark}]{.underline} Outside of
traditional power politics, the call for the United States to respect
China's "core interests"--- as many Chinese and foreign scholars have
noted---is a loaded statement. While the United States is not opposed to
respecting a state's national interests, it tends to be unwilling to
respect national interests which are highly contested, which is the
situation for the majority of China's "core interests[." In addition
to]{.underline} [[traditional Chinese national interests, such as
**Taiwan**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Tibet, and Xinjiang, [China's "core
interests" [also]{.mark} **[cover most of its territorial claims in
Asia]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The United States is concerned that
[[China's "new model]{.mark} of major-country relations" [is a
ploy]{.mark} designed [to trick the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[into acknowledging China's extensive
territorial claims and undercutting the interests
of]{.mark}]{.underline} American [a[llies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
long-time strategic partners in the Asia-Pacific region, which would
likely result in the [weakening of the American-led "hub-and-spoke"
security structure]{.underline}, a security framework China hopes to
replace with its New Asian Security Concept. There are also suspicions
in the United States that China's proposal is a call for the creation of
spheres of influence, a concept to which the Obama administration has
been consistently opposed. America's approach to Sino-American strategic
stability is to have China and the United States focus on cooperation
and agree to avoid letting competition in one area affect cooperation
and collaboration in others. In many ways, this resembles China's old
"shelving disputes and pursuing joint development" strategy for Asia. As
this kind of strategy is the geopolitical equivalent of sweeping dirt
under the rug, it is only effective to a point. Eventually, the dirt
spills out. Sooner or later, unaddressed problems surface. At best, this
approach is only a temporary stop on the road to functional strategic
stability. At worst, this approach has already outlived its usefulness.
China views this strategy as an attempt by the United States to avoid
addressing China's demands that the United States acknowledge China's
rise to great power status and redefine the relationship accordingly,
which only encourages the already strong Chinese desire to push forward
the "new model of major-country relations." China and the United States
are at an impasse regarding strategic stability. [While both states have
made commitments and promises to prevent great power conflict, neither
China nor the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has developed a
reasonable or implementable solution for Sino-American strategic
stability.]{.underline} Thus, competition continues unmanaged, unchecked
and confrontation is steadily evolving into conflict. Drawing Lines in
the "Sea" The problems pushing the Sino-American relationship towards
conflict are numerous and diverse, but if you are looking for the issue
most likely to cause conflict, you need look no further than the South
China Sea. China perceives the territorial disputes in this area as
issues in which aggressive foreign state actors led by the United States
are threatening China's territorial sovereignty. For China, because of
its history, territorial sovereignty issues implicate regime survival in
a way that transcends all other quarrels and disagreements. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, on the other
hand, [[views China's territorial claims]{.mark} and actions to bolster
those claims [as]{.mark} Chinese expansionism, [aggression
against]{.mark} American [allies]{.mark} and strategic
partners]{.underline}, and a threat to the guiding principles of the
liberal world order---which the United States views as crucial for the
preservation of America's global hegemonic power. The situation in the
South China Sea has been steadily escalating for several years now. In
April, 2014, American defense secretary Chuck Hagel met with Chinese
defense minister Chang Wanquan. During the meeting, Hagel said, "All
parties should refrain from provocative actions and the use of
intimidation, coercion, or aggression to advance their claims. Such
disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with
international law." Chang replied, "I'd like to reiterate that the
territorial sovereignty issue is a Chinese core interest. On this issue,
we will make no compromises, no concessions. Not even a tiny bit of
violation will be allowed." The inability to discuss openly or
compromise on this issue has made it impossible to resolve and has led
to escalation and increased tension. In the aftermath of this meeting,
China began investing heavily in island construction and land
reclamation activities in disputed waters. As these activities have
stirred up a lot of dust in the region, the United States has demanded
that China abandon its present course of action, insisting that it is
provocative and negatively impacting regional peace and stability. [Not
only has [China dismissed America's demands, it]{.mark} has also
[increased its military presence in contested areas]{.mark} in order to
establish anti-access zones]{.underline}. While China claims that its
actions are within the scope of international law, the United States
asserts that Chinese actions are in violation of the law of the sea and
laws for the regulation of the international commons. China argues that
the South China Sea issue is a territorial sovereignty issue, yet the
United States regards this issue as a freedom of navigation dispute, as
well as a fight for the preservation of the international legal
system---a cornerstone for the American-led liberal world order. In
August of this year, the United States launched its new Asia-Pacific
Maritime Security Strategy, which aims "to safeguard the freedom of the
seas, deter conflict and escalation, and promote adherence to
international law and standards." The Asia-Pacific region is now at the
heart of the American naval security agenda. In response, Chinese
foreign ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said that China "opposes any
country's attempt to challenge China's territorial sovereignty and
security under the pretext of safeguarding navigation freedom."
Responding to Chinese criticisms of America's new regional maritime
security strategy, American Defense Secretary Ashton Carter stated,
"Make no mistake, we will fly, sail, and operate wherever international
law permits...We will do that at times and places of our choosing." In
2014, the United States carried out "freedom of navigation" exercises in
various parts of the world and challenged the territorial claims of 18
different countries; however, the United States has yet to officially
challenge China's claims in the South China Sea. But, that may soon
change, as the United States is currently considering sending American
naval vessels within 12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands in
order to force China to end its land reclamation activities. Such plans
are considered aggressive, dangerous and extremely provocative by the
Chinese. A recent Global Times editorial read, "China mustn't tolerate
rampant US violations of China's adjacent waters and the skies over
these expanding islands. The Chinese military should be ready to launch
countermeasures according to Washington's level of provocation." The
article further stated, "If the US encroaches on China's core interests,
the Chinese military will stand up and use force to stop it." The
article stated plainly, "If the US adopts an aggressive approach, it
will breach China's bottom line, and China will not sit idly by." Other
reports from this newspaper, a state-sponsored Chinese media outlet,
have made it clear that [[if the bottom line for the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is that China must end all of its land reclamation
activities in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea, then [war
is inevitable]{.mark}, which suggests that this issue may be the tipping
point for the Sino-American relationship]{.underline}. How the United
States and China choose to move forward on this issue will permanently
redefine the relationship between these two great powers. Granted, this
may just be saber rattling, but even if that is the case, **[[this issue
is still decidedly zero-sum]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[which increases
the likelihood of conflict.]{.underline} [[For China,]{.mark} [political
preservation and]{.mark} [a]{.mark} potential [Chinese sphere of
influence]{.mark} [are on the line,]{.mark} [and for the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [the liberal
world order and [American hegemony are at stake.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Sooner or later, this trying issue will need to be resolved, and
regardless of whether it is resolved through diplomacy or military
force, it will take a toll on the geopolitical influence of either one
or both countries. Were the international institutions for collective
security strong enough to handle situations like this when they
arise---and if China and the United States were willing to establish a
new relationship model which addresses each country's respective
security concerns and encourages effective collaboration---it might
actually be possible to resolve this issue peacefully. But given current
circumstances, this is little more than idealism and wishful thinking.
As [**[there is currently no clear solution to this problem that would
allow both countries to walk out of this situation with their heads held
high]{.mark}**, these two states are pondering the
unthinkable]{.underline}. Depending on each country's level of
commitment and resolve, this situation may have already passed the
tipping point. [The outcome of the geopolitical power struggle between
China and the United States will almost certainly be decided in the
South China Sea]{.underline}. Some have suggested that the South China
Sea issue is not a Sino-American issue. On the contrary, it is the most
pressing Sino-American issue. [[One side will either choose to back down
or be forced to back down.]{.mark} No matter how everything plays out in
the South China Sea, geopolitics in the Asia-Pacific region will never
be the same again.]{.underline}

Whether a Sinocentric structure in Asia is a subconscious Chinese goal
or not, there are enough lingering fears elsewhere in the region about
this prospect to create active resistance to the concept. Simply put,
[we should expect Japan, India, Vietnam, the Philippines,
and]{.underline} many ot[hers to resist the establishment of a new
Middle Kingdom]{.underline}. [[Should the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[scale back its security role]{.mark} in the region, that [resistance
would also occur]{.mark}]{.underline}, only in more unstable and
dangerous forms. It is important to discuss why [[China\'s
neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline} tolerate-indeed, even [[welcome-U.S.
security]{.mark} hegemony in the region]{.underline} and why, by
contrast, [these same countries would strongly resist Chinese
hegemony.]{.underline} There is a structural reason why this is so, and
it relates to geography and is therefore enduring: [China is a large
neighbor in the region and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is not.]{.underline} [Because the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has to project its presence across a vast ocean,
it requires the permission of most countries in the region to continue
its role as the security hegemon.]{.underline} The United States
requires bases, access rights, and negotiated agreements with local
governments to fulfill its security guarantees. [If these governments
withdrew their permission due,]{.underline} say, to [bad American
behavior, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would find it
difficult and costly to sustain its presence]{.underline} across the
ocean in the face of broad resistance. [China,]{.underline} by contrast,
[is a permanent presence in the region that the neighbors can never
dislodge]{.underline}. [[Should China engage in the same bad behavior,
these countries cannot make China go away. They can only **fight or
accept China\'s treatment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} It is therefore
easier for the countries in the region to enter into a security contract
with an outside power, knowing they have some bargaining leverage and an
escape clause. [When dealing with a powerful neighbor like China that
isn\'t going anywhere, the only way to achieve the same bargaining
leverage is to match that neighbor\'s power]{.underline}, especially its
military power. And [that implies arms races and spiraling security
dilemmas]{.underline}.10 Thus, [hegemons are not all created
equal]{.underline}. [It is easier to strike a bargain with an outside
hegemon than with a local one]{.underline}-an immutable reason why the
U.S. security presence will be welcome in the region. Even more
crucially, [U]{.underline}.[S. service as the region\'s security hegemon
is much more likely to result in stability than if the region were left
alone to find its own stable structure]{.underline} (more on this
below}. Adding to America\'s attractiveness as an outsider are [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' seven-decade [record of
keeping the region\'s commons open for all and its not having
territorial disputes with countries in the region.]{.underline} [The
logic behind why most countries in the region welcome the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as the security hegemon, and
why most would resist China attempting to play the same role, is a
strong argument for maintaining this arrangement.]{.underline} Which
brings us to Global Trends\' second pathway, the Hobbesian scramble for
security, as the most likely outcome should the United States opt to
reduce its costs by withdrawing from the region. As this chapter will
later explore, [[this outcome would very likely **trigger multisided
missile and nuclear arms races** across the region]{.mark}, with
unpredictable and unstable consequences]{.underline}. The risk of
military disaster inside the most important economic region in the world
would rise abruptly. [[**The U.S. economy** and standard of living would
not escape the risks and costs of these developments]{.mark}. It is easy
to see how the absence of the United States as an outside security
provider could result in a dangerously unstable security competition in
East Asia.]{.underline} [[The rapid rise of China\'s military power
would create the logic for an **offsetting alliance by most of its
neighbors**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Some however (perhaps, e.g., a future
unified Korea) may choose to bandwagon with China instead, especially if
historical grievances make allying with some of China\'s adversaries
politically unacceptable[. [Bandwagoning]{.underline}]{.mark} [by some
[would increase the **security anxiety**]{.mark} of the remainder that
don\'t.]{.underline} Finally, some significant powers (e.g., Russia)
might choose to remain unaligned, which would compound the region\'s
uncertainty because the players would have to ponder how these neutrals
would eventually act during a regional crisis[. Should one or more
countries conclude that stability was unachievable and conflict
inevitable, the calculation would then turn to the logic of security
trends and time pressure and the **possible advantage gained by striking
first** rather than waiting for adversaries to grow even stronger in the
future.]{.underline}

If there is [a single theme that unifies]{.underline} much of [what
follows]{.underline}, it [is the]{.underline} often **[underestimated
importance of political beliefs and ideology]{.underline}**. America\'s
post-Cold War strategy for dealing with China was rooted in prevailing
liberal ideas about the linkages between trade, economic growth and
democracy, and a faith in the presumed universality and irresistible
power of the human desire for freedom. [The strategy pursued by
[China]{.mark}\'s leaders]{.underline}, on the other hand, was, and
still [[is]{.underline}, **[motivated]{.underline}**]{.mark} first and
foremost **[by their commitment [to preserving]{.mark}]{.underline}**

and grievances against foreign powers, [and its **rejection
of**]{.underline} the idea that there are, in fact, **[[universal human
values]{.underline}]{.mark}** [are essential pieces of its programme for
mobilising **popular support** and bolstering **regime
legitimacy**]{.underline}. [[It is impossible to **make sense**
of]{.mark} the ambitions, fears, strategy and tactics of
[China]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} present [regime [without]{.mark}
reference to [its **authoritarian,**]{.mark} **illiberal
[character]{.mark}**]{.underline} and distinctive, Leninist roots. The

[by]{.mark}]{.underline}** the [traditional]{.underline} dynamics of
**[[power politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- that is, by the narrowing

also by]{.underline} a wide and [**[deep divergence]{.underline}** [in

[[The]{.mark} resulting [rivalry is more
**intense**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [the **stakes are

interests]{.underline}, [some of which could]{.underline} conceivably
[be reconciled]{.underline}, [but [by **incompatible visions for the
future**]{.mark} **of Asia and the world**]{.underline}.
[[China\'s]{.mark} current [rulers]{.mark}]{.underline} may not be

policies of their [people and governments]{.underline}, and [to suppress
information and discourage the expression of opinions seen as

to these new realities, American and allied policymakers cannot afford
to downplay the ideological dimension in their own strategy.
[[Beijing\'s]{.mark} obsessive [desire to]{.mark} squelch dissent,

### T/ Human Rights

#### If the US doesn't sell weapons, it becomes impossible to pressure them over human rights concerns

[Countries cut off by the US will still be able to purchase advanced
systems]{.underline}. Worse, [they will be able to do so without
depending on the US for maintenance, ammunition or spare
parts]{.underline}. [This eliminates a key lever for US influence in the
event that human-rights abuses occur]{.underline}, for instance. [Take
Turkey]{.underline}. In 2016 and 2017 [it had been attempting to
purchase helicopters]{.underline} and other technology from US
manufacturers, [but was turned down due to concerns around deteriorating
governance]{.underline}. [Then late last year it acquired a
sophisticated missile-defence system from Russia]{.underline} for
\$US2.5 billion, an unprecedented move for a member of NATO. Vietnam's
relations with the US have been pleasantly thawing, partly because of a
common concern around China's aggressiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.
[The US lifted its arms embargo on Vietnam in 2016, but residual
concerns about human rights have largely limited sales to sonars and
radars]{.underline}. In addition the US has not provided meaningful
military assistance to Vietnam to help offset costs. [As a result,
Vietnam continues to purchase much of its military equipment from
Russia, which often subsidises the transactions.]{.underline} Or
consider Thailand, traditionally one of America's closest security
partners in Asia. A 2014 coup caused concern about the country's
trajectory and led the US to limit some weapons sales. China took
immediate advantage, signing a deal to sell over \$US1bn of submarines
to the Thai navy. Late last year Bangkok announced plans to establish a
joint naval centre with Beijing to service those submarines, as well as
a joint arms factory to produce and maintain other military equipment.
There are more examples around the world. [As the US moves into a phase
of more intense competition with Russia and especially China, its
approach to arms transfers must change]{.underline}.

"In 2018, China's arms sales increased, continuing a trend that enabled
China to become the world's fastest-growing arms supplier during the
past 15 years," according to the 2019 China Military Power report
published by the Department of Defense. "From 2013 through 2017, China
was the world's fourth-largest arms supplier, completing more than \$25
billion worth of arms sales." ["Arms transfers also are a component of
China's foreign policy,]{.underline} used in conjunction with other
types of military, economic aid, and development assistance to support
broader foreign policy goals," the Pentagon report said[. "These include
securing access to natural resources and export markets, promoting
political influence among host country elites]{.underline}, and building
support in international forums." Needless to say, [the United States
and other countries have long done the same thing, using arms exports as
an instrument of foreign policy and political influence]{.underline}. Up

human rights and other considerations]{.underline}**. See U.S. Arms

### Petro-Yuan Scenario (v Saudi Arabia)

#### The plan causes Riyadh to rely on China, resulting in a petro-yuan and the death of dollar heg

**Ramani 2018** - PhD Candidate in IR @ Oxford\
Samuel, \"The Risks of the China-Saudi Arabia Partnership,\" Feb 17,
https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/the-risks-of-the-china-saudi-arabia-partnership/

**[Saudi Arabia's Balancing Act Between China and the United
States]{.underline}** Even though Washington did not react strongly to
China's emergence as Saudi Arabia's largest trade partner in 2010, [many
U.S. policymakers are concerned that China will make Saudi Arabia an
unwitting pawn in its efforts to erode U.S. hegemony over global
financial markets]{.underline}. These concerns have risen sharply since
Saudi Arabia's Vice Minister of Economy and Planning Mohammed
al-Tuwaijri announced on August 24 that Saudi Arabia planned to
partially cover its budget deficit in Chinese yuan to reduce its
financial dependency on the U.S. dollar. Many American economists have
expressed alarm at Saudi Arabia's willingness to borrow in Chinese yuan,
[as Riyadh's decision could cause other oil-exporting countries to
abandon the U.S. dollar in favor of the "petro-yuan."]{.underline} A
marked decline in the use of the U.S. dollar as the preferred
credit-issuing currency by oil-producing countries would greatly weaken
the U.S. dollar's long-term viability as a global reserve currency. [As
the United States views its alliance with Saudi Arabia as the lynchpin
of its Middle East strategy, Washington will likely react strongly if
Riyadh uses its influence within OPEC to strengthen the Chinese
yuan.]{.underline} [As Saudi Arabia remains dependent on U.S. arms sales
to pursue its geopolitical objectives in the Middle East]{.underline}
and counter Iran, **[intense U.S. pressure would likely cause Riyadh to
distance itself from Beijing,]{.underline}** limiting economic
integration between the two countries. In addition to setting informal
limits on the scope and nature of Saudi Arabia's economic partnership
with China, [Riyadh's dependence on U.S. military equipment restricts
its ability to purchase large quantities of Chinese arms.]{.underline}
Historically, [Saudi Arabia has only purchased arms from China to
pressure the United States into selling Riyadh highly sophisticated
weaponry]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia's purchases of DF-3 missiles from
China in 1987, and current procurements of Chinese stealth weaponry for
military use in Yemen, exemplify its tactical approach to arms deals
with Beijing. [As U.S.-Saudi Arabia relations have improved considerably
under Donald Trump, the need for Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from
China will likely decrease]{.underline} in the years to come. As Qatar
has been able to covertly purchase Chinese SY-400 missiles with little
U.S. scrutiny, and China has a long-standing defense partnership with
Iran, the Chinese government is likely to forge stronger defense links
with Saudi Arabia's chief rivals, straining the Beijing-Riyadh
partnership.

#### That puts the whole international order in jeopardy 

**Cao 2016** Lan, Fowler School of Law @ Chapman University, \"Currency
Wars and the Erosion of Dollar Hegemony,\" Michigan Journal of
International Law, Vol 38 Iss 1)

As George Soros succinctly described, "in the financial sphere the
Bretton Woods institutions---the IMF and the World Bank---have lost
their monopoly position. Under Chinese leadership, a parallel set of
institutions is emerging."404 Soros noted that against [this context of
"rival camps" with China and Russia on one side and the United States on
the other, "China has begun to build a parallel set of financial
institutions,]{.underline} including the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank (AIIB); the Asian Bond Fund Initiative; the New Development Bank
(formerly the BRICS Bank); and the Chiang Mai Initiative, which is an
Asian regional multilateral arrangement to swap currencies."405 I have
focused on the New Development Bank and on a myriad of other actions,
from the various ChinaRussia bilateral agreements, the historic gas
deal, to demonstrate that the hegemony of the dollar is being eroded as
more and more countries seek to price oil and gas in a currency other
than the dollar, such as the yuan. Since the closure of the gold window,
[the dollar's unique status has been maintained partly by its linkage to
oil. Breaking the dollar-oil link will be a significant step toward
bringing the world closer to a non-dollar-based regime.]{.underline}
Hence, it is interesting to note that whereas Saddam Hussein moved to
price oil in a currency other than the U.S. dollar,406 Iraq post-Saddam
Hussein is now committed to selling oil in dollars.407 [The search for
hard assets such as oil, gas, gold and other natural resources has also
intensified]{.underline}. Gold in particular remains relevant to the
international economy, despite vociferous claims to the contrary. It
remains relevant despite prior efforts to demote it. Take as an example
the move by the IMF in January 1976 to convert the SDR "from a
gold-backed reserve asset to one referencing a basket of paper
currencies."408 Take as another example the deliberate effort by the
United States during the Carter administration to lower the price of
gold by dumping 300 tons of it onto the international market.409 to show
that dollars, rather than gold, should be the global reserve currency.
[China's quest to internationalize the yuan and its recent inclusion in
the IMF's SDR basket reflect not only Chinese desire "to use financial
liberalization as an engine of growth" but also its "ultimate ambition
of replacing the US dollar as the dominant currency in the
world."]{.underline}410 It is not only China but Russia as well that has
stepped up efforts to increase its own gold reserves. From 2004 to 2013,
Russian reserves increased from 390 tons to over 1,000 tons.411 Through
QE, massive printing of dollars has upset the complex relationship
between the dollar and other currencies tied to it, such as the yuan.
Dollar devaluation has resulted in inflation in other countries,
contributing to economic stress and political revolutions in many parts
of the world. Moreover, [the drive to repatriate gold in the
post-2008-financial crisis world must be seen in this context--of
growing mistrust in the global financial system,]{.underline} in the
same way that mistrust during the Cold War drove Germany and other
European countries to keep its gold stored in New York rather than risk
confiscation by the Soviets on the other side of the Iron Curtain. "If
the United States or the U.K. suddenly deemed it necessary to confiscate
foreign gold to defend its paper currency in a crisis, that gold would
be conveyed from the original owners to the possession of the United
States or the U.K."412 [As there is mistrust in paper money such as the
dollar, there is an increasing demand to accumulate gold as a reserve
asset]{.underline}. As Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank
declared in 2013, "I never thought it wise to sell \[gold\] because for
central banks this is a reserve of safety. It's viewed by the country as
such. In the case of non-dollar countries, it gives you a fairly good
protection against fluctuations of the dollar."413 This Article has
connected seemingly disparate dots in [the international economic system
to warn about the dangers that lie beneath the dollar's apparent
strength. Before any serious efforts to defend the system can be
mustered]{.underline},414 the [first task is to realize that positive
snapshots, a rallying stock market, a strong dollar, a robust economic
recovery, or a slowdown in China's economy]{.underline}415 [may in fact
be deceiving because what lies beneath are fault lines that pose
fundamental danger to the postWorld War II international economic
regime.]{.underline}

At this point, [[the]{.mark} long-term national interests [of
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline} **[Latin
America]{.underline}** [remain united in]{.underline}]{.mark} [a desire
for economic prosperity, and the faster arrival of [a **multipolar
world**]{.mark}]{.underline} where both have relative influence over
regions of the world. To achieve this, [Latin American [nations]{.mark}
and Russia seek [to **balance out power** with the **US**]{.mark} in
**Latin America**]{.underline} for this purpose (as Latin America is not
and will not likely be able to successfully enact policy in a united
manner in any other area of the world). Conclusions In an interview in
2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that, "We are interested
in strong, economically stable and politically independent, united Latin
America that is becoming an important part of the emerging polycentric
world order."30 Given the past 15 years of Latin American movement
toward a Russian-led sphere, it would seem as though the region wants to
pursue the same policy goals. The historical ties between the two
regions create a basis from which current cooperation is not only easily
facilitated but also almost natural. If the realist school of thought is
assumed to be true, then it would make sense that naturally, Latin
America and Russia, both of which have potential to exude more influence
in their respective regions, would wish to see that expand onto the
international stage, to a more favorable context---a multipolar world.
As [[Russia has begun]{.mark} a more **[aggressive]{.mark} foreign
[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to display its]{.mark} reinvigorated
**[military]{.mark}** and **economy**]{.underline}, [it is in the
position to pursue such goals further abroad, in Latin America, which is
yet unable to coherently influence the world]{.underline} outside its
own region. Therefore, Russian leaders, with experiences from the Cold
War, will use realist, geopolitical strategy to confront perceived
challenges to the nationalism that pervades its policies -- specifically
the US. One of the best ways it has found, is to engage a region nearly
devoid of US attention given current events, and that has enough history
with the US to have built up a resentment and desire for autonomy that
would make an aligning of interests mutually beneficial. For the US, the
past historical grievances perceived by Latin America, combined with a
lack of interest today, as well as a liberalist foreign policy to date
has not allowed it to sufficiently maintain its grip to the south of its
borders. That said, [[the inevitability of a **Russia-Latin America
sphere**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[or]{.mark} the faster transition into
[multipolarism is **not**]{.mark} **necessarily
[evident]{.mark}**]{.underline} either. However, [there are measures
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [can
take that would allow for a **refocus** on]{.underline} **[Latin
America]{.underline}** [to counter **Russian intervention**]{.underline}
there. [Those policies]{.underline}, which should theoretically take
place within the next decade, [would be best to **mimic Russian
activity**]{.underline} today. [[By pursuing]{.mark}
**economic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[political
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[with the region with the
mutually beneficial policies between equal partners, [the US]{.mark}
government [can show]{.mark} Latin American [leaders]{.mark} that the
era of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Monroe Doctrine]{.mark} has truly
[ended]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as Secretary of State John Kerry
announced at the end of 2013.31 This action alone is a significant step
in the direction of mutual respect and moderation that could benefit the
US. Fortunately, it also shares a positive history with Latin America,
and can use this to justify further involvement in supporting
organizations like MERCOSUR, the OAS, or others. [[Opening]{.mark} up
**political [relations with Cuba]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by beginning
dialogue between both governments [has]{.mark} also [been]{.mark} a step
[noticed]{.mark} **[across Latin America]{.mark}**]{.underline} as one
in a positive direction. [[Unless the US is able to]{.mark} pursue
a]{.underline} **[[moderate]{.underline}]{.mark}**d
**[approach]{.underline}** to governments (particularly contrarian,
anti-American governments) in the region, [[Latin America will]{.mark}
continue to **[drift toward Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [creating an
**unfavorable world order**]{.underline} in the future. In this case,
moderation includes countering Russian involvement in Latin American
trade and political organizations, normalizing relations with "security
threats" such as Venezuela or Cuba that begins a more active and
apologetic role in developing Latin America to their mutual benefit. The
projection for National Intelligence Council (NIC) 2030 in the Stalled
Engines World, where the US draws inward and allows competitors to fill
vacuums to pursue their interests is not inevitable.32 At the moment,
[[Russia]{.mark} has [illustrated the trend by]{.mark} successfully
[making inroads]{.mark} into Latin America [in an effort to]{.mark}
create a [**balance** **against US hegemony**]{.mark} as a unipolar
state in the **international system**]{.underline} today. [[Without
action]{.mark} within the **near future**]{.underline}, [this
[cooperation]{.mark} between Latin America and Russia [could create an
**unfavorable world order**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for the US as
multipolarism comes to the fore of the international
system]{.underline}, but will certainly benefit Russia and Latin America
to the extent of the investment in their reinvigorated relationship.

**New Latin American partnership [staves off]{.underline} Chinese
[encroachment]{.underline} -- that's the [litmus test]{.underline} for

**Cerna 11** \[Michael, China Research Center, China\'s Growing Presence

With both the U.S. and China making gains in the region in different
sectors, there is seemingly room for each side to grow; which implies
that, in fact, trade with Latin America is not a zero-sum game.
**[[China presents an alternative to the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, but that is not necessarily a bad
thing. The U.S. is much more diversified than China at the moment and
therefore does not need to enter into direct competition. However, as
China responds to calls from Brazil and diversifies its investments,
[there is increasing worry that China is going to outmatch U.S.
trade]{.underline} in the region. [These fears may be economically
based, but [there are]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[harmful
political consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} -- primarily, [[providing
Latin America]{.mark} with a **quasi-world power as [an alternative to
the U.S.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Since the Monroe Doctrine, Latin America
has been considered a secure sphere of influence for the U.S. [[The
fact]{.mark} that [China presents a less democratic alternative to U.S.
influence presents a major problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. The third BRICS
summit in April provided more insight into the potential consequences of
China's growing place in Latin America via its relations with Brazil.
One proposal to emerge from the summit of the five nations (Brazil,
India, China, Russia and South Africa) was a broad-based international
reserve currency system providing stability and certainty. The idea was
to set up a new exchange rate mechanism that would bypass the U.S.
dollar as the reserve currency of the world. In addition, banks of the
five BRICS nations agreed to establish mutual credit lines in their
local currencies, not in U.S. currency. While the chances of such a
proposal gaining support are debatable, [[it sets a clear example of
a]{.mark} possible **[shift]{.mark} in power [away from the
U.S]{.mark}**. and [toward a]{.mark} more [global
organization]{.mark}]{.underline}, one that is arguably [**[anchored by
China.]{.underline}** [If China becomes a preferred partner in Latin
America, **it will show**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**that [U.S. dominance
around the globe also is at risk]{.mark}**.]{.underline} So what does
China's growing place in the region mean for the future? Depending on
whom this question is posed to, there are two probable answers. The
first is that [[China's intensifying relations]{.mark} with Latin
America [offer a clear sign of the end of U.S. dominance]{.mark} in the
region, [and]{.mark} in a greater sense, **[the entire
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [There is **enough evidence to show that
the tides have changed in favor of China.**]{.underline} The other
answer is that it means nothing. The U.S. is obviously still the more
dominant power in the region, and Chinese presence will eventually
subside, again leaving the United States as the region's premier
partner. The real answer probably falls somewhere in the middle. Is
China the preferred partner for Latin America? At this point, the
definitive answer is no. However, [[the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[should not take its place in the region for
granted]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is clear evidence of an
increasingly symbiotic relationship with China throughout Latin America.
While the U.S. is the most dominant trade partner to the region as a
whole, it is losing ground in key countries, namely Brazil, which is
blossoming on the world stage and is emerging as the clear leader in the
region. Increasing trade and investment can be beneficial for all, but
the power that China can derive from its growing economic influence
could bring increased political and ideological influence that the U.S.
might find unnerving. China already has replaced the U.S. as the largest
trading partner for Brazil and Chile, and is on pace to do the same in
Peru and Venezuela. At the very least, [[this should cause the U.S. to
pay **more attention to**]{.mark} **its [southern neighbors]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}and take steps to make sure that China only benefits
economically and not politically at the expense of the U.S. **[The world
will be watching]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As it stands, the Chinese are
not broadening their relations with the region in a way that directly
competes with the United States. China is strictly concerned with
commodities, including oil. U.S. President Barack Obama recently signed
an agreement with Brazil's Petrobras that will allow the oil company to
drill in the Gulf of Mexico. [This symbolic move could cause tensions to
increase as the world's two largest oil consumers battle]{.underline}
over rights to Brazilian oil. In that regard, [the [competition may **go
beyond a race to Latin commodities** and move into]{.mark} the realm of
**[fighting for political influence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is odd to
think that the United States would need to compete for hemispheric
dominance with a country on the other side of the globe, but [China's
actions and increasing integration into the region tell us that such a
scenario may one day arise.]{.underline} [[Given]{.mark} the
[**proximity** and **importance** of Latin America to the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates,
[[this]{.mark} region [could be **the symbolic battle** that best
measures]{.mark} **the [continued hegemony of the U.S. versus
China.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[China's]{.mark} attempts to expand its [influence]{.mark} in Latin
America [represent]{.mark} a [**critical**]{.mark}]{.underline}, if
understated, [portion of this policy of **[hedging against the
U.S]{.mark}.**]{.underline} threat. Indeed, [[Latin America represents
a]{.underline} **[glowing]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for Chinese planners [to
**undermine U.S. power**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and reduce their own
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline}. [Latin American [farms
produce]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[11 percent of]{.mark} global
[food]{.mark}]{.underline}** and agriculture production value. Moreover,
[Latin America retains **[immense resource
wealth]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The region's mines extract significant
portions of the world's copper, silver, molybdenum, zinc, and lithium
supplies. [Additionally, Latin America can serve as an **[alternative
energy]{.mark} supplier**]{.underline} [for China]{.underline}, given
Venezuela's sustained oil reserves and the increasing discovery of
harder-to-extract resources like shale and oil sands. Not only does
Latin America provide an effective resource hedge---[its markets will
also become increasingly important as Chinese leaders attempt to change
the country's internal economic profile.]{.underline} Newly confirmed
President-for-Life Xi Jinping has indicated that the next step in
China's development will be an attempt to change its economy from a
low-skill, labor-intensive export juggernaut to a more balanced system,
in which medium and high-skill exports are coupled with growing material
imports, especially in China's megacities. [China's departure from the
ranks of producer-exporter nations will leave a **significant gap** in
the global economy's structure, as Chinese [firms]{.mark} increasingly
[seek to compete with American]{.mark} **refined [goods]{.mark}**
producers rather than support the]{.underline} [**high-skill U.S.
economy.** Latin America is poised to]{.underline} **[fill China's
void]{.underline}**. Its high levels of income inequality and nearly
600-million population can support increasing economic
industrialization, thus enabling China's economic transition by serving
as a base for Beijing's increasingly sophisticated economy. Moreover,
Latin America's markets will become increasingly attractive to Chinese
producers. Not only will Chinese medium-skill refined goods find their
way to Latin America, but Chinese companies will also rely on the Latin
American upper class to consume an expanding set of high-skill products.
[The CCP has **already begun**]{.underline} working toward these
long-term objectives. Chinese firms have purchased Chilean and Peruvian
copper mines and obtained major stakes in Venezuelan oil fields. Between
2015 and 2019, China's leaders plan to invest \$250 billion in the
region and reach trade levels of \$500 billion. China's investment is
aided by its lax environmental and ethical standards, and the
willingness of Chinese companies to accept higher levels of risk and
extend more secure lines of credit. The willingness to accept higher
risk offers China a great deal of leverage. Sri Lanka's experience
serves as an example---the island nation had to surrender the major port
of Hambantota to China on a 99-year lease in order to repay its debts to
Chinese firms. Additionally, [[it is easy to envision]{.mark} the CCP
[supporting]{.mark} the **small, [elite classes]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of Latin American states to increase its regional influence, [at the
detriment of **democratic governance**]{.mark}]{.underline} [throughout
the **continent**]{.underline}. **[Colombia]{.underline}**,
**[Bolivia]{.underline}**, **[Brazil]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Panama]{.underline}** [are **particularly vulnerable**]{.underline}
to these actions, [due to present **income disparities** within each
country.]{.underline} By slowly decreasing its export relationship with
the United States, [[China's leaders]{.mark} can steadily [strengthen
its]{.mark} political **[position]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[nullify the]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[diplomatic
and economic [instruments]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[possesses to counter China]{.mark}.
Given Chinese **naval expansion projections**]{.underline} over the next
two decades, [it is essential to consider the possibility that Chinese
[aircraft carrier battle groups will **project naval power
across**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the Pacific]{.mark} to Latin American
coastlines, [forcing]{.mark} the U.S. government to accept the **[loss
of global sea control]{.mark},**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} by
extension, [the elimination of the **international
system**]{.mark}]{.underline} it has cultivated for the past 70 years.
Growing Chinese influence in Latin America poses not only economic and
security threats to U.S. interests, but an equally dangerous political
one. China lacks the ideological commitments of the Soviet Union, as
shown by its willingness to support North Korea's totalitarian system,
former President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwean military dictatorship, and
the explicitly Muslim Pakistan and Iran. [[Authoritarian regimes
are]{.mark} more **[pliable]{.mark}**]{.underline} than democratic ones,
[especially when it comes to Chinese **economic
interests**]{.underline}. They lack the ethical scruples that limit
representative governments, allowing fundamentally predatory economic
practices that benefit the ruling elite but harm all others. Over time,
[absent a **counterbalancing force**]{.underline}, [Chinese [pressure
could]{.mark} progressively **[reverse]{.mark} Latin American
[democratization]{.mark}**, creating states **hostile to
America**]{.underline} [in its geopolitical]{.underline}
**[backyard]{.underline}**. During the first years of the 20th century,
the U.S. government gained control of the Panama Canal. In his
characteristic manner, President Theodore Roosevelt combined targeted
displays of American power with inducements to local authorities to
obtain a prize arguably unparalleled in U.S. history. Much like its
cousin in Egypt, the Panama Canal greatly shortened transit times
between hemispheres. This facilitated international trade, and more
important, enabled U.S. warships to travel between the Pacific and
Atlantic fleets, giving America undisputed sea control over the Western
Atlantic and Eastern Pacific. This forced Britain to accept America's
growing power, however begrudgingly, setting the stage for the steady
rise of the United States to global preeminence. China has abandoned its
attempts to construct a Nicaraguan Canal to compete with its Panamanian
counterpart. Nevertheless, the episode, combined with growing Chinese
investment in Latin America, is illustrative. Equally revealing is
China's \$65 billion investment plan in Latin America and the Caribbean
states called the "Forum of China and the Community of Latin American
and Caribbean States," an important Chinese vehicle for controlling the
region's natural resources and raw materials. Surrendering control of
these valuable commodities will diminish the independence of
participating nations and prove antithetical to their interests, but the
allure of Chinese investments may be too strong. For the moment,
[Chinese political [pressure is]{.mark} **most
[apparent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in the CCP's attempts to

trading partner for]{.underline} Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and
Guatemala, **[four of the five]{.underline}** [Central American states
that recognize Taiwan.]{.underline} Several states, including the United
States and the majority of its allies, maintain unofficial diplomatic
relations with Taiwan. However, [by **chipping away** at Taiwan's

**further**]{.underline}. [In the event of a **military

[and is]{.mark} only [recognized by]{.mark} **fewer than [5 percent of

America will thus prove extremely useful, for its long- and short-term
goals, and in both its own region and America's. Washington
policymakers, whether elected or appointed, political or military, have
safely assumed that the United States is secure from foreign powers'
adventures to its south. International communism posed an intermittent
challenge to this proposition throughout the Cold War. Nevertheless, the
Western Hemisphere has been viewed as a secondary, or even tertiary,
theater of great-power competition. Aside from infrequent applications
of military force, law enforcement agencies have been the major
implements of American power in Latin America since 1945. This
demonstrates the security of America's regional position. Or at least,
it did up until now. [China's moves threaten to transform Latin American
nations into **strategic liabilities**]{.underline} for Washington. The
United States has not faced a serious threat in its own hemisphere since

### AT: China Peaceful 

#### No peaceful rise 

**Mulgan 2016**- prof of Japanese politics, U of New South Wales\
Aurelia George, \"China's Rise as a Predator State,\"
thediplomat.com/2016/03/chinas-rise-as-a-predator-state/

[China's land grab and]{.underline} subsequent [militarization of
"islands]{.underline}" in the South China Sea [have]{.underline} finally
[dispelled the myth that its rise will be peaceful.]{.underline} Indeed,
these developments point to an unwelcome fact -- that **[China has
become a predator state.]{.underline}** Rand's Michael Mazarr wrote
about predator states in the late 1990s. He argues that what
distinguishes a predator state above all is "territorial aggression" --
the predisposition to grab territory and resources. China is one of two
contemporary examples; the other is Russia in Europe. The best
historical examples are Napoleonic France, Nazi Germany and Imperial
Japan, and more recently Iraq under Saddam Hussein. These examples teach
us that predator states cause wars. Predator states are buoyed by an
expansionist ideology -- the active promotion of the idea that
neighbouring territories (both land and maritime) belong by rights to
the predator. Such states often possess a sense of historical grievance
or victimization that can only be "righted" by territorial grabs.
Indeed, a Mazarr contends, the "politics of memory operates
powerfully...causing \[predator states\] to react by forming aggressive,
predatory instincts." Besides territorial aggression, predator states
exhibit several other distinguishing features. First, [national policy
demonstrates very high levels of militarization. Predator states divert
large quantities of national resources into military expansion for
purposes of power projection]{.underline}. The emphasis in military
planning and weapons acquisitions is inherently offensive rather than
defensive and is geared to intimidating potential adversaries and
winning offensive wars. The flipside domestically is, as Mazarr writes,
that "military, nationalistic, and territorial issues continue to play a
large role in domestic politics and in the states' approach to the
world." In China's case, nationalism has overtaken Marxism and more
recently developmentalism as state ideology. Second, [predator states
adopt a strongly strategic perspective on national advancement and
display an associated willingness to use all the institutions and
instruments of the state over which they maintain control]{.underline}
-- economic, cultural, military, technological, resource, trade, legal,
media -- in the pursuit of this overwhelming important strategic
objective. China, for example, deployed a broad range of retaliatory
instruments against Japan over the Senkaku Islands affair in 2010,
including restricting the export of rare earth metals. The use of such
"strategic" instruments extends beyond such punitive acts of state
retaliation to a whole range of long-term, so-called "market-based"
investments. These include foreign acquisitions in strategically
important and sensitive areas such as land, resource and water assets
and critical infrastructure as well as in private-sector developments
and industries. The "strategic" element cannot be discounted in these
acquisitions because the line between private enterprise and state-owned
enterprises in the Chinese case is imprecise given the complex
interweaving of business and state actors. In the end, everything
becomes "strategic" in the sense of supporting national advancement and
security. Third, predator states are not democracies where there exist
checks and balances and other moderating influences that negate the
potential for predation against other states. Predator states have
authoritarian governments with low levels of accountability. Political
leaders are only answerable to other power cliques and display a
willingness to engage in political repression, including imprisonment
and even murder of their opponents. In such states, there is no real
separation of the executive from the judiciary and, in that sense, no
rule of law. Levels of domestic lawlessness are matched by international
lawlessness. Predator states do not respond to appeals to international
laws or norms because they are inherently lawless themselves -- they
understand and respect only power in international affairs. [China's
actions in the South China Sea clearly demonstrate that it does not
support a rules-based regional or global order; nor does it believe that
you can fight power with rules as other states are attempting to do in
dealing with this issue.]{.underline} Finally, [predator states show a
predisposition to act unilaterally rather than multilaterally.
Multilateral cooperation is entertained only where it fits with the
long-term strategic interests of the state.]{.underline} Moreover, there
is little willingness to trade off state interests for larger collective
interests in the international community. In that sense, predator states
are not interested in providing international public goods and should
not be considered as potentially benign hegemons.

Following the example of previous hegemons, [[China is]{.mark} also
[expanding its regional military reach]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the
1990s, Chinese military spending has soared, and the CCP is modernizing
weaponry and reforming its military organizations and doctrine. The
People's Liberation Army (PLA) has adopted the doctrine of "anti-access,
area denial" to push the U.S. military away from its shores and
airspace. China has also built the region's largest coast guard and
controls a vast militia of civilian fishing vessels. In 2017[, the [PLA
opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti; it will likely
build more bases along the African east coast and the Indian Ocean in
coming years]{.mark}. Meanwhile, [in the South China Sea, China has
built six large islands that house air force bases, missile shelters,
and radar and communications facilities.]{.mark}]{.underline} Already,
the U.S. military finds itself constrained by the expanding bubble of
Chinese air defenses, by China's growing ability to find and strike U.S.
naval vessels, and by an increased missile threat to U.S. air bases and
ports. [[Beijing is using these capabilities to more forcefully assert
its territorial claims]{.mark}. By transiting disputed waters and
massing ships there, Beijing is pressuring Japan militarily over a
cluster of small islands called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkaku by
Japan. Elsewhere, to deny access to disputed areas, the [PLA swarms
fishing and coast guard vessels, and fires water cannons at other
countries' ships]{.mark}. Last summer, after asserting ownership of an
oil-rich area in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone, [Beijing threatened
to use military force if Vietnam did not stop]{.mark}
drilling.]{.underline} Vietnam stopped drilling. Contemporary China's
quest for regional military dominance follows the behavior of previous
regional hegemons, including China itself. As the historian Peter Perdue
has argued, modern China is a product of invasions that subdued all of
modern Xinjiang and Mongolia, and reached Tibet, as well. Chinese
dynasties, he has written, "never shrank from the use of force,"
including the "righteous extermination" of rival states and rebels.
Throughout Asia, Chinese military garrisons subdued invaders and
pirates.

[[Beijing is]{.mark} also [interfering in]{.mark} the [domestic politics
of other countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} Citing China specifically[,
Canadian [intelligence officials have warned of foreign agents who might
be serving as provincial cabinet ministers and government
employees]{.mark}. And in 2016, a scandal erupted in Australia after [it
was revealed that Sam Dastyari, a senator]{.mark} who had defended
Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea, [had financial ties
to a Chinese firm]{.mark}, prompting new laws banning foreign political
donations.]{.underline} Historically, regional hegemons have [intervened
extensively in domestic politics]{.underline} to support friendly
governments [and undermine parties and leaders perceived as
hostile]{.underline}. Within China's tribute system, [the emperor
delegated the administration of subservient states to local leaders, an
approach known as "using barbarians to govern barbarians.]{.underline}"
But [[local independence went only so far]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the
sixteenth-century statesman Chang Chu-cheng said of such vassals, "Just
like dogs, if they wag their tails, bones will be thrown to them; [[if
they bark wildly, they will be beaten with sticks; after the beating, if
they submit again, bones will be thrown to them again; after the bones,
if they bark again, then more beating."]{.underline}]{.mark} Japan
similarly intervened in domestic politics during its imperial heyday. In
the Philippines, for example, it abolished all political parties except
for the pro-Japanese one. Elsewhere, it delegated control to friendly
local leaders and police, and trained such leaders at institutes in
Japan. If officials in China, Korea, and Manchuria did not cooperate,
Tokyo relied on a Japanese paramilitary organization that intimidated,
blackmailed, and assassinated local leaders.

#### Historical resentment and militarization of surrounding countries proves.

When examining [[China's current behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
context of previous regional hegemonies, some common themes stand out.
First, economic interdependence [[has a dark side]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Although interdependence raises the cost of conflict, it also creates
leverage. [China's centrality in regional trade and finance increases
its coercive power, which Beijing has already begun to
exercise]{.underline}. Second, history shows that regional hegemons
[[meddle extensively in their neighbors' domestic
politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed[, [Beijing has already begun to
reverse its much-touted policy of nonintervention]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As China grows stronger, its neighbors can expect Beijing to
increasingly interfere in their domestic politics. East Asian countries
need to decide whether this is something they are willing to accept. In
particular, [Japan, the only country with the potential power to balance
China, faces an important choice]{.underline}. Since World War II,
[Japan has adhered to a highly restrained national security policy,
spending just one percent of its GDP on defense.]{.underline} For
obvious historical reasons, the Japanese people are suspicious of
military statecraft, and they worry about a lagging economy and the
expense of caring for an aging population. They may decide to continue
devoting their wealth to butter rather than guns. This would be a
perfectly valid choice, but before making it, the Japanese people should
contemplate their life in China's Asia. Beijing and Tokyo are already
embroiled in a bitter territorial dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku
Islands. To gain control of the islands, weaken the U.S.-Japanese
relationship, and advance other interests, Beijing can be expected to
use greater military and economic coercion and to meddle in Japanese
politics. Beyond a hegemon's normal reasons to intervene, [[China
harbors deep historical resentment toward Japan. Imagine if the United
States had actually hated Cuba. If Japan decided that Chinese hegemony
would be unacceptable, its national security policy would need to
change]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States' global interests and
commitments allow Washington to devote only some of its resources to
Asia. It would not have the capability, let alone the will, to balance
Beijing alone. Japan would need to become more like West Germany: a U.S.
ally that, although outgunned and directly threatened by a hostile great
power, mobilized substantial military might and was a true partner with
the United States in securing its national defense.

Whether a Sinocentric structure in Asia is a subconscious Chinese goal
or not, there are enough lingering fears elsewhere in the region about
this prospect to create active resistance to the concept. Simply put,
[we should expect Japan, India, Vietnam, the Philippines,
and]{.underline} many ot[hers to resist the establishment of a new
Middle Kingdom]{.underline}. [[Should the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[scale back its security role]{.mark} in the region, that [resistance
would also occur]{.mark}]{.underline}, only in more unstable and
dangerous forms. It is important to discuss why [[China\'s
neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline} tolerate-indeed, even [[welcome-U.S.
security]{.mark} hegemony in the region]{.underline} and why, by
contrast, [these same countries would strongly resist Chinese
hegemony.]{.underline} There is a structural reason why this is so, and
it relates to geography and is therefore enduring: [China is a large
neighbor in the region and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is not.]{.underline} [Because the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has to project its presence across a vast ocean,
it requires the permission of most countries in the region to continue
its role as the security hegemon.]{.underline} The United States
requires bases, access rights, and negotiated agreements with local
governments to fulfill its security guarantees. [If these governments
withdrew their permission due,]{.underline} say, to [bad American
behavior, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would find it
difficult and costly to sustain its presence]{.underline} across the
ocean in the face of broad resistance. [China,]{.underline} by contrast,
[is a permanent presence in the region that the neighbors can never
dislodge]{.underline}. [[Should China engage in the same bad behavior,
these countries cannot make China go away. They can only **fight or
accept China\'s treatment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} It is therefore
easier for the countries in the region to enter into a security contract
with an outside power, knowing they have some bargaining leverage and an
escape clause. [When dealing with a powerful neighbor like China that
isn\'t going anywhere, the only way to achieve the same bargaining
leverage is to match that neighbor\'s power]{.underline}, especially its
military power. And [that implies arms races and spiraling security
dilemmas]{.underline}.10 Thus, [hegemons are not all created
equal]{.underline}. [It is easier to strike a bargain with an outside
hegemon than with a local one]{.underline}-an immutable reason why the
U.S. security presence will be welcome in the region. Even more
crucially, [U]{.underline}.[S. service as the region\'s security hegemon
is much more likely to result in stability than if the region were left
alone to find its own stable structure]{.underline} (more on this
below}. Adding to America\'s attractiveness as an outsider are [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' seven-decade [record of
keeping the region\'s commons open for all and its not having
territorial disputes with countries in the region.]{.underline} [The
logic behind why most countries in the region welcome the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as the security hegemon, and
why most would resist China attempting to play the same role, is a
strong argument for maintaining this arrangement.]{.underline} Which
brings us to Global Trends\' second pathway, the Hobbesian scramble for
security, as the most likely outcome should the United States opt to
reduce its costs by withdrawing from the region. As this chapter will
later explore, [[this outcome would very likely **trigger multisided
missile and nuclear arms races** across the region]{.mark}, with
unpredictable and unstable consequences]{.underline}. The risk of
military disaster inside the most important economic region in the world
would rise abruptly. [[**The U.S. economy** and standard of living would
not escape the risks and costs of these developments]{.mark}. It is easy
to see how the absence of the United States as an outside security
provider could result in a dangerously unstable security competition in
East Asia.]{.underline} [[The rapid rise of China\'s military power
would create the logic for an **offsetting alliance by most of its
neighbors**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Some however (perhaps, e.g., a future
unified Korea) may choose to bandwagon with China instead, especially if
historical grievances make allying with some of China\'s adversaries
politically unacceptable[. [Bandwagoning]{.underline}]{.mark} [by some
[would increase the **security anxiety**]{.mark} of the remainder that
don\'t.]{.underline} Finally, some significant powers (e.g., Russia)
might choose to remain unaligned, which would compound the region\'s
uncertainty because the players would have to ponder how these neutrals
would eventually act during a regional crisis[. Should one or more
countries conclude that stability was unachievable and conflict
inevitable, the calculation would then turn to the logic of security
trends and time pressure and the **possible advantage gained by striking
first** rather than waiting for adversaries to grow even stronger in the
future.]{.underline}

### AT: Interdependence Checks

#### Interdependence won't check Beijing -- they are revisionist

**Lind 2018** - Associate Professor of Government at Dartmouth College\
Jennifer, \"Life in China\'s Asia: What Regional Hegemony Would Look
Like,\" Mar/Apr,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-02-13/life-chinas-asia

[It may be tempting to believe that China will be a relatively benign
regional hegemon. Economic interdependence]{.underline}, one argument
goes[, should restrain Chinese aggression]{.underline}: because the
legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rests on economic
growth, which depends on trade, Beijing would maintain peaceful
relations with its neighbors. Moreover, China claims to be a different
sort of great power. Chinese officials and scholars regularly decry
interventionism and reject the notion of "spheres of influence" as a
Cold War relic. Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that his country
has "never engaged in colonialism or aggression" thanks to its
"peace-loving cultural tradition." In this view, life in China's Asia
would not be so different from what it is today. But [**this is not how
regional hegemons behave**. Great powers typically dominate their
regions in their quest for security.]{.underline} [They develop and
wield tremendous economic power]{.underline}. [They build massive
militaries, expel external rivals, and use regional institutions and
cultural programs to entrench their influence]{.underline}. Because
hegemons fear that neighboring countries will allow external rivals to
establish a military foothold, [they develop a profound interest in the
domestic politics of their neighborhood, and even seek to spread their
culture to draw other countries closer. China is already following the
strategies of previous regional hegemons. It is using economic
coercion]{.underline} to bend other countries to its will. It is
building up its military to ward off challengers. [It is intervening in
other countries' domestic politics to get friendlier policies. And it is
investing massively in educational and cultural programs to enhance its
soft power. As Chinese power and ambition grow, such efforts will only
increase]{.underline}. China's neighbors must start debating how
comfortable they are with this future, and what costs they are willing
to pay to shape or forestall it.

### AT: China War Limited

#### There's no limited US-China war -- Beijing [mixes]{.underline} conventional and nuclear capabilities and US military strategy focuses on [disabling]{.underline} crucial infrastructure, that forces Beijing into [use it or lose it]{.underline} and makes them fear the US plans a [nuclear first strike]{.underline}

The bad news is that one other trigger remains: a [conventional
war]{.underline} that [threatens China's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}.
Conventional forces can threaten nuclear forces [in ways that generate
pressures to escalate]{.underline}---[especially when]{.underline} ever
more [capable U.S. conventional forces face adversaries
with]{.underline} relatively small and [fragile nuclear arsenals, such
as China. If U.S. operations endangered]{.underline} or damaged [China's
nuclear forces, Chinese leaders might]{.underline} come to [think that
Washington had aims beyond]{.underline} winning the [conventional
war]{.underline}---[that it might]{.underline} be seeking to disable or
[destroy China's nuclear arsenal]{.underline} outright, perhaps as a
prelude to regime change. In the fog of war, [Beijing might]{.underline}
reluctantly [conclude that limited nuclear escalation]{.underline}---an
initial strike small enough that it could avoid full-scale U.S.
retaliation---[was a viable option]{.underline} to defend itself. STRAIT
SHOOTERS The most [worrisome flash point]{.underline} for a U.S.-Chinese
war [is Taiwan]{.underline}. Beijing's long-term objective of reunifying
the island with mainland China is clearly in conflict with Washington's
longstanding desire to maintain the status quo in the strait. It is not
difficult to imagine how this might lead to war. For example, China
could decide that the political or military window for regaining control
over the island was closing and launch an attack, using air and naval
forces to blockade Taiwanese harbors or bombard the island. Although
U.S. law does not require Washington to intervene in such a scenario,
the Taiwan Relations Act states that the United States will "consider
any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and
security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United
States." Were Washington to intervene on Taipei's behalf, the world's
sole superpower and its rising competitor would find themselves in [the
first great-power war of the twenty-first century.]{.underline} In the
course of such a war, U.[S. conventional military operations
would]{.underline} likely threaten, disable, or outright
[eliminate]{.underline} some [Chinese nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}---whether doing so was Washington's stated
objective or not. In fact, [if the United States engaged in the style of
warfare it has practiced over the last 30 years]{.underline}, this
[outcome would be]{.underline} all but [guaranteed.]{.underline}
[Consider submarine warfare.]{.underline} China could use its
conventionally armed attack submarines to blockade Taiwanese harbors or
bomb the island, or to attack U.S. and allied forces in the region. If
that happened, the [U.S. Navy would]{.underline} almost [certainly
undertake an antisubmarine campaign, which would]{.underline} likely
[threaten China's]{.underline} "boomers," the [four nuclear-armed
ballistic missile submarines]{.underline} that form its naval nuclear
deterrent. China's [conventionally armed and nuclear-armed submarines
share the same shore-based communications system; a U.S. attack on these
transmitters would]{.underline} thus not only disrupt the activities of
China's attack submarine force but also [cut off its boomers from
contact with Beijing]{.underline}, leaving Chinese leaders unsure of the
fate of their naval nuclear force. [In addition, nuclear ballistic
missile submarines depend on attack submarines for
protection]{.underline}, just as lumbering bomber aircraft rely on
nimble fighter jets. [If the United States started sinking Chinese
attack submarines, it would be]{.underline} sinking the very force that
protects China's ballistic missile submarines, [leaving the latter
dramatically more vulnerable.]{.underline} Even more dangerous, [U.S.
forces]{.underline} hunting Chinese attack submarines [could
inadvertently sink a Chinese boomer]{.underline} instead. After all, at
least some Chinese attack submarines might be escorting ballistic
missile submarines, especially in wartime, when China might flush its
boomers from their ports and try to send them within range of the
continental United States. Since correctly identifying targets remains
one of the trickiest challenges of undersea warfare, a U.S. submarine
crew might come within shooting range of a Chinese submarine without
being sure of its type, especially in a crowded, noisy environment like
the Taiwan Strait. Platitudes about caution are easy in peacetime. In
wartime, when Chinese attack submarines might already have launched
deadly strikes, the [U.S. crew might decide to shoot first and ask
questions later.]{.underline} Adding to China's sense of vulnerability,
the small size of its nuclear-armed submarine force means that [just two
such incidents would eliminate half of its sea-based
deterrent.]{.underline} Meanwhile, any Chinese [boomers that
escaped]{.underline} this fate [would]{.underline} likely [be cut off
from communication]{.underline} with onshore commanders, left [without
an escort force]{.underline}, and [unable to return to destroyed
ports]{.underline}. If that happened, [China would essentially have no
naval nuclear deterrent]{.underline}. The [situation is similar
onshore]{.underline}, where any U.S. military campaign would have to
contend with China's growing land-based conventional ballistic missile
force. Much of this force is within range of Taiwan, ready to launch
ballistic missiles against the island or at any allies coming to its
aid. Once again[, U.S. victory]{.underline} would [hinge on the ability
to degrade]{.underline} this [conventional ballistic missile
force.]{.underline} And once again, it [would be virtually
impossible]{.underline} to do so [while leaving China's nuclear
ballistic missile force unscathed.]{.underline} Chinese [conventional
and nuclear ballistic missiles are]{.underline} often [attached to the
same base]{.underline} headquarters, [meaning that]{.underline} they
likely [share]{.underline} transportation and supply networks, patrol
routes, and other [supporting infrastructure]{.underline}. It is also
possible that they share some command-and-control networks, or that the
[United States would be unable to distinguish between]{.underline} the
conventional and nuclear [networks even if they were]{.underline}
physically [separate.]{.underline} To add to the challenge, [some of
China's ballistic missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear
warhead]{.underline}, and the [two versions are virtually
indistinguishable to]{.underline} U.S. [aerial
surveillance]{.underline}. In a war, targeting the conventional variants
would likely mean destroying some nuclear ones in the process.
Furthermore, [sending manned aircraft to attack Chinese missile launch
sites]{.underline} and bases [would require at least partial control of
the airspace over China]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in turn [would
require weakening Chinese air defenses]{.underline}. But degrading
China's coastal air defense network in order to fight a conventional war
[would]{.underline} also [leave much of its nuclear force without
protection.]{.underline} Once China was under attack, its leaders might
come to fear that [even intercontinental ballistic missiles located deep
in the country's interior were vulnerable]{.underline}. For years,
observers have pointed to the U.S. military's failed attempts to locate
and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles during the 1990--91 Gulf War as evidence
that mobile missiles are virtually impervious to attack. Therefore, the
thinking goes, China could retain a nuclear deterrent no matter what
harm U.S. forces inflicted on its coastal areas. Yet recent research
suggests otherwise. [Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles are
larger and less mobile]{.underline} than the Iraqi Scuds were, and they
are [harder to move without detection. The United States is]{.underline}
also likely to have been [tracking them]{.underline} much more
[closely]{.underline} in peacetime. As a result, China is unlikely to
view a failed Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30 years ago as reassurance that
its residual nuclear force is safe today, especially during an ongoing,
high-intensity conventional war. [China's]{.underline} vehement
[criticism of a U.S.]{.underline} regional [missile defense
system]{.underline} designed to guard against a potential North Korean
attack [already reflects these latent fears. Beijing's worry is that
this]{.underline} system [could help Washington block]{.underline} the
handful of [missiles China might launch in the aftermath of a U.S.
attack]{.underline} on its arsenal. [That]{.underline} sort of [campaign
might seem]{.underline} much more [plausible in Beijing's eyes if a
conventional war had]{.underline} already [begun to]{.underline}
seriously [undermine other parts of China's nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}. It does not help that [China's real-time
awareness]{.underline} of the state of its forces [would probably be
limited]{.underline}, since blinding the adversary is a standard part of
the U.S. military playbook. Put simply, the favored U.S. strategy to
ensure a conventional victory would likely endanger much of China's
nuclear arsenal in the process, at sea and on land. [Whether the United
States actually intended to target all of China's nuclear weapons would
be incidental]{.underline}. All that would matter is that [Chinese
leaders would consider them threatened.]{.underline}

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI), [China's conventional arms sales surged from \$650 million in
2008 to \$1.13 billion in 2017]{.underline}.1 The lion's share of these
exports, around [74 percent, went to Asia]{.underline}. An additional
[21 percent flowed into Africa]{.underline}. Although China has
established itself as an arms export leader, the [overall value of its
trade still pales in comparison to the United States]{.underline}, whose
[exports averaged \$9 billion]{.underline} annually over the last ten
years. Most of Beijing's arms exports are sold to countries close to
home. Despite low levels of arms exports throughout the mid-1990s and
into the mid-2000s, most of what China did export (82.8 percent) were
shipped to countries across Asia. This trend has continued as China has
emerged as a leader in the global arms trade. A combined [62.4 percent
of China's conventional weapons]{.underline} sales since 2008 have
[found their way to Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.]{.underline}
Other Asian countries have purchased an additional 11.8 percent of
Chinese arms. Over the past decade, [Chinese arms sales across South and
Southeast Asia grew from \$386 million]{.underline} in 2008 [to \$1.5
billion]{.underline} in 2016 before falling to \$948 million in 2017.
Notwithstanding this growth, China lags other traditional arms exporters
to the region. Since 2008, the US has exported \$27.2 billion worth of
conventional weapons across Asia (not including the Middle East).2
[Close military ties have paved the way for China to supply Pakistan
with more arms]{.underline} than any other country. **[These exchanges
are]{.underline}** often **[tied to political objectives]{.underline}**.
Due in large part to growing [cooperation between Beijing and Islamabad
on counter-terrorism initiatives]{.underline}, sales surged from \$250
million in 2008 to over \$750 million in 2009. In March 2018, [Beijing
announced the sale of]{.underline} sophisticated optical tracking
[systems that could be used for nuclear missiles]{.underline} with
multiple warheads. This announcement came just weeks after India
successfully tested the Agni-V long-range ballistic missile in
mid-January. Other purchases highlight close levels of collaboration
between China and Pakistan, such as the [co-developed JF-17
aircraft]{.underline}. Bangladesh is also a strong buyer of Chinese
weapons. Between 2008 and 2017, [China provided \$1.86 billion of
weapons to Bangladesh]{.underline}. This constitutes [71.9 percent of
Bangladesh's military acquisitions]{.underline} over this period, making
China far and away the biggest supplier of arms to Dhaka. **[China
supports these procurements by offering generous loans and providing its
wares at competitive prices]{.underline}**. Discounted [acquisitions
include the]{.underline} 2013 [transfer of two]{.underline} used
Type-035G [Ming-class submarines]{.underline} for Bangladesh for just
over \$100 million each. Since 2006, China has also supplied Bangladesh
with the majority of its small arms, totaling [over 16,000 rifles and
4,100 pistols]{.underline}. Myanmar is the third largest market for
Chinese arms exports in Asia. Since the easing of sanctions against
Myanmar in the early 2010s, it has ramped up its acquisition of foreign
arms. This buying spree has enabled China to make considerable inroads.
Over the last six years, [Myanmar has imported \$954 million in
conventional weapons from China]{.underline}. Higher ticket items
[include 17 JF-17 aircraft, 12 Chinese Rainbow UAVs, 2 Type-43 Frigates,

World\'s Top Arms Dealer?\" Nov 21,
https://thediplomat.com/2017/11/can-china-replace-the-us-as-the-worlds-top-arms-dealer/

But it may not be too long before the United States needs to worry about
competition directly in its niche. [China is taking steps to modernize
the relationship between its defense industrial base and its technology
sector, with the hope of generating investment in firms that work at the
juncture between the latter and the former]{.underline}. Leveraging the
relationship between civilian and military technology is how the United
State achieved military superiority over the Soviet Union during the
Cold War. It's also been a preoccupation of advocates of the "Third
Offset," which hopes to further harness the U.S. tech sector in the
service of maintaining American superiority in military technology. And
there are indications that the Chinese are ever-more-ready to challenge
the United States in this arena. The Chinese defense industry remains
far more autarkic than the United States', and is still largely state
controlled. But [allowing heavy civilian investment into
military-related civilian industries]{.underline}, as well as focusing
on building linkages between civilian industries and the military,
[could accelerate Chinese innovation.]{.underline} [If China can
successfully connect its burgeoning tech industry with its defense
industrial base]{.underline} (a project that even the United States has
struggled with), [then it can accomplish something that the Soviet Union
utterly failed at]{.underline}. Obviously, many obstacles remain, some
of which the United States also faces. The task of integrating China's
state-owned defense giants with its private sector tech companies will
be enormously complicated, with many potential pitfalls. Not the least
of these is convincing Chinese tech firms that their technologies are
safe in the hands of state-owned defense giants, a task that is probably
even more difficult than getting U.S. tech firms to work with Lockheed
Martin and Raytheon. The eventual outcome might look something like the
European model, where large, state-controlled defense firms have a
tolerably good relationship with the civilian sector. The difference
would be that, as in the United States, the defense industrial base can
count on huge, consistent government outlays. [If China can square the
circle, it can compete with the United States not only on the air and at
sea, but also in the international arms market]{.underline}. Chinese
arms in the hands of traditional U.S. export partners may not be quite
as dangerous as those in Chinese hands, but they have the potential to
undercut a dominant U.S. market position.

### Uniqueness Overwhelms the Link

#### US limits to Chinese expansion fail -- they've still expanded globally

[China is selling arms to more countries and is now the world's leading
exporter of armed drones]{.underline}, according to a report released by
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday.∂
But the latest data from the Swedish think tank shows [Chinese arms
exports increased by a relatively low 2.7 per cent in the period from
2014 to 2018, compared to the previous five years]{.underline}.∂ Weapons
exports from the United States, however, jumped 29 per cent in the
2014-18 period from 2009-13.∂ Meanwhile, [China expanded its customer
base to 53 countries in 2014-18, up from 41 in the previous five
years]{.underline}.∂ [The researchers also found that China is the world
leader in sales of armed drones, or unmanned combat aerial
vehicles]{.underline} -- supplying 153 of them to 13 countries in the
past five years.∂ By contrast, [the US -- the world's biggest arms
exporter -- only sold five armed drones, to Britain, over the 10 years
from 2009.]{.underline}∂ [The main buyers of the Chinese drones are
Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates.∂]{.underline} Nan Tian, a researcher with
SIPRI's arms transfers and military expenditure programme, said [China's
military technology advances -- with more emphasis on developing its own
weapons -- were a key reason for the slower growth in arms
exports]{.underline}, along with its defence budget.∂ "Previously, China
relied on foreign countries such as Russia, Ukraine and France in
developing its own armament industry," Nan said. "Now, **[it has
increasingly turned to domestic manufacturers such as AVIC and Norinco
in arms exports]{.underline}**."∂ He added that armed drones had been
"one of the most visible technological developments" made by Chinese
arms producers.∂ As export growth has slowed, China's military spending
has been increasing at a more modest pace. Last week, [Beijing said the
defence budget would rise 7.5 per cent for 2019, the fourth consecutive
year of single-digit spending growth for the People's Liberation
Army.∂]{.underline} SIPRI, which monitors the international arms trade,
said [the slower growth in China's weapons exports in recent years
contrasted sharply with the 195 per cent rise in arms sales in the
2009-13 period, from the previous five years]{.underline}.∂ Pakistan,
China's key ally in South Asia, remained Beijing's top arms buyer in the
last five years -- a position it has maintained since 1991 -- followed
by Bangladesh and Algeria.∂ The US, Russia, France, Germany and China
are the world's top five arms exporters, accounting for three quarters
of the total volume of weapons sales from 2014 to 2018.∂ Of China's arms
exports, 70 per cent went to Asia and Oceania in the last five years,
followed by 20 per cent going to Africa and 6.1 per cent to the Middle
East.∂ Meanwhile, the top three buyers of American weapons were all US
allies -- Saudi Arabia, Australia and the UAE.∂ The SIPRI report noted
that almost all of the biggest arms importing countries were not on
China's top buyers list.∂ "[China's arms exports are limited by the fact
that many countries -- including four of the top 10 arms importers in
2014-18 (India, Australia, South Korea and Vietnam) -- will not procure
Chinese arms for political reasons]{.underline}," the report said.

#### Pakistan deal thumps

[Vows by China and Pakistan to deepen security and defence ties will
reinforce Beijing\'s ambitions to increase its arms
exports]{.underline}, which could create unease among some countries in
the region, especially India, security experts say.∂ President Xi
Jinping made his first state visit to Pakistan last week and met Prime
Minister, Nawaz Sharif, with the sides agreeing to boost their
partnership to \"all-weather levels\".∂ [The two nations also decided to
step up dialogue between their armed forces, and expand cooperation in
defence technology and production]{.underline}.∂ Three weeks before Xi
departed for the trip, [Sharif approved a US\$5 billion deal to buy
eight submarines from China]{.underline}, Reuters reported, quoting an
unnamed Pakistani government official as saying, but added the deal had
not been finalised. **[It would be China\'s largest single sale of
submarines,]{.underline}** experts say.∂ [The deal would likely
encourage Beijing to expand arms exports]{.underline}, said Mathieu
Duchatel, head of the China and Global Security Project at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, which tracks global military
spending and arms sales.∂ \"**[With progress in its defence industry and
strong government support for research and development, China has become
a major player in weapons system]{.underline}**,\" Duchatel said.
\"**[The success in the deals with Pakistan will make it easier for
China to secure markets in the countries in which China has strong
defence relationship, as it means that the weapon systems are already
tested.]{.underline}**\" China was the third-largest arms exporter in
2012-13 but has since fallen to fifth place, behind Britain, France,
Russia and the United States, according to the institute\'s research.
But it remains the main supplier for Pakistan, delivering half of the
country\'s arms from 2010-14.∂ Li Jie, a researcher at the PLA Navy\'s
Military Academy, said the submarine deal likely involved the Type
039-class, a diesel-electric vessel that first went into operation in
the 1990s. China had sold submarines overseas before, but the deal with
Pakistan was the biggest, he said.∂ \"The Type 039-class submarine is
equipped with an advanced air-independent propulsion system, which would
allow the warship to stay and operate underwater much longer and make it
more difficult to be detected by its enemies,\" Li said.∂ \"The Pakistan
Navy will gain a competitive advantage in their underwater fighting
capability.\" [China is pushing for deeper ties with
Pakistan]{.underline} amid concerns over Islamabad\'s ability to
maintain security within its own borders. Beijing wants a planned
network of roads, railways and energy projects linking Pakistan\'s
deepwater Gwadar port with the Xinjiang region on the mainland.∂ The
corridor would shorten the route for energy imports, bypassing the
Strait of Malacca, a bottleneck at risk of blockade in wartime.∂ Beijing
has also expressed concerns about terrorists from Pakistan and
Afghanistan entering Xinjiang, and has pledged to help broker talks
between political factions in Afghanistan. Pakistan, for its part, is
seeking a reliable supplier of advanced weapons amid tensions with
India.∂ \"This is a big step forward,\" said Imtiaz Gul, founder and
political analyst for the Centre for Research and Security Studies in
Islamabad. \"[Pakistan does not attract much foreign investment, or much
defence and military cooperation from Western countries. Anything that
comes Pakistan\'s way in terms of finance and military hardware helps
end Pakistan\'s international isolation]{.underline}.\"∂ But the deal
could stoke an already heated arms race in the region. \"The proposed
sale of eight Type 039 submarines by China to Pakistan is bound to
result in India\'s need to retaliate,\" said D.S. Rajan, a former
director of India\'s Chennai Centre for China Studies, adding Pakistan
would likely equip the submarines with nuclear-tipped missiles.∂ \"India
still has no such subs with nuclear-tipped missiles,\" he said. \"India
may therefore feel more and more anxious to fill this gap.\"∂ Dr
Rajeswari Rajagopalan, a defence analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer
Research Foundation think tank, agreed the deal would have serious
consequences for the region but said it was unlikely to result in
increased arms spending on both sides.∂ \"Nevertheless, India has been
paying adequate attention in recent years to the acquisition of naval
capabilities, including submarines. This is something India has to do
irrespective of the China-Pakistan deal,\" he said.∂ \"If India does not
replenish the dwindling submarine force, it will end up having the same
number of submarines as Pakistan. And now if this deal goes through,
that number will be heavily skewed in favour of Pakistan.\"

#### Nobody wants Chinese arms -- malfunctioning systems, defective weapons, empirical failures

In [November 2016]{.underline}, China held its major biennial air show
in Zhuhai. The event brought in 700 exhibitors as potential customers
from Africa and Asia flocked to see Beijing's military wares. The main
focus of interest was, of course, [China's new J-20 stealth
fighter]{.underline} --- the country's next-generation warplane --- as
the air show was the site of the [plane's first public
demonstration.]{.underline} But the Chinese arms industry is also having
trouble, according to the December 2016 edition of O.E. Watch, the
newsletter for the U.S. Army's Foreign Military Studies Office.
"[Despite]{.underline} this [attention, China still faces]{.underline} a
number of [hurdles in the defense trade industry]{.underline}," the
newsletter noted. "The [global perception of the Chinese defense
industry is less than adequate]{.underline}. Some of the perceptions are
[due to malfunctioning systems or defective weapon designs]{.underline}.
Additionally, [China lacks]{.underline} extra services, such as
[training and the maintenance of equipment and arms]{.underline}. Some
[countries also lack political trust in China."]{.underline} To be sure,
China has made serious inroads around the world by selling weapons. Two
thirds of African countries now use Chinese arms. Over the last few
years Chinese weapons exports reached record highs. But [lately, arms
deals have slowed]{.underline} --- and Russia and America still dominate
the global market. In September, [Chinese exhibitors apparently
struggled to find buyers]{.underline} at an air show in South Africa
even as officials in Beijing aggressively tried to secure deals [for the
JF-17 fighter]{.underline} --- a Chinese-Pakistani equivalent to the
U.S.-made F-16. Several African countries are more heavily scrutinizing
their budgets with consequences for arms sales. [Nigeria is]{.underline}
currently [the only African country with JF-17s on order.]{.underline}
When [Cameroon purchased four brand new Chinese attack
helicopters]{.underline}, one of them [crashed shortly after
delivery]{.underline}, causing an apparent freeze in new acquisitions.
There have been concerns among some buyers about the quality of Chinese
weapons. Compared to battle-tested American and Russian weapons, many
Chinese systems have yet to prove themselves to new military customers.
[During an Indonesian Navy exercise]{.underline} on Sept. 14, 2016, [two
Chinese made C-705 missiles failed to hit their targets]{.underline}
after launching from two KCR-40 attack ships. This was a particularly
embarrassing setback in no small part because Indonesian Pres. Joko
Widodo personally witnessed it.

[Saudi Arabia has already been increasing business with the Russians and

Saudi Crown Prince at the Kremlin, where the two agreed to "expand
cooperation in oil and gas matters" after working together on output
deals to stabilize markets amid fluctuating global crude prices. And
October of last year saw the first-ever visit of a Saudi monarch ---
King Salman --- to Russia, during which a \$1 billion joint investment
fund was created and 15 cooperation agreements were signed in the areas
of technology, defense and agriculture, including Moscow's readiness to
sell Riyadh its S-400 missile defense system. [China, meanwhile, is the
kingdom's largest trading partner]{.underline}, with \$42 billion in
bilateral trade in 2017. Last March, [the two signed a raft of deals
worth a reported \$65 billion in sectors ranging from energy to space
technology]{.underline}. Some in Riyadh have also talked of trading oil
in yuan instead of dollars as retaliation for potential U.S. sanctions.
[But as trade tensions with the U.S. continue to put strain on China's
economy, it is likely to lay low at this stage to avoid further conflict
with the U.S. administration.]{.underline} Additionally[, China is far
from able to match U.S. weapons production in terms of sophistication

[Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest. In the case of
Taiwan]{.underline}, for example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs
to purchase weapons from other countries to provide for its defense,
[those weapons do not have to be made in the United States.]{.underline}
[Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China
tensions.]{.underline} Even if Taiwan's defenses remained robust, [China
would clearly prefer a situation in which American arms no longer signal
an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's behalf]{.underline}. This could
also promote more productive U.S.-China diplomacy in general, as well as
greater stability in the Pacific region. Most important, [breaking off
arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of the United States
becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan and
China.]{.underline}

## INTERNAL ANSWERS

### Arms not key to Influence

#### The disad is just wrong -- China sells to a litany of countries in Africa but its sale strategy does not provide geopolitical benefits to advance a revisionist agenda. It only uses sales in Asia to challenge US influence -- not the same elsewhere because they are defensive realists.

[Although the]{.underline} total [volume of]{.underline} major [arms
flow from China to Africa is less than half of Russia's, **it sells to
far more African countries than Russia.**]{.underline} Between 2013--17,
[Russia sold]{.underline} major [arms to 14 Africa countries, compared
to the 23 of China.]{.underline} [This "blanket" style of selling **does
not**]{.underline} typically [**fit with the notion of linking**
targeted **arms sales with foreign policy objectives.**]{.underline}
[The diversity in the types of weapons and of arms
recipients]{.underline} (e.g., from Algeria to South Africa and Kenya to
Cote d\'Ivoire) **[suggests a more demand and supply
relationship]{.underline}**. As China continues to develop its arms
industry, [any international buyer will help expand its
network]{.underline}, offer important developmental feedback, and
improve weapon quality and company profitability. [The fall in export of
Russian]{.underline} made w[eapons to Africa corresponded with the rise
in Chinese exports]{.underline}, potentially due to the availability of
more cost-effective options. This is especially the [c]{.underline}ase
[in Algeria]{.underline}, where [import of]{.underline} major [Chinese
arms increased by 46-fold]{.underline} between 2008-2012 and 2013-2017,
while the transfer of Russian weapons fell by 35%. Yet in-depth analysis
into Chinese arms exports to Africa shows Algeria as an outlier that is
biasing the recent trends. Of all major weapons exported from China to
Africa between 2013 and 2017, 46% went to Algeria, prime among them are
three heavy corvettes delivered in 2015 and 2016. Remove Algeria and
major arms exports to Africa decreased by 12% between 2008-2012 and
2013-2017. Other [major African buyers of Chinese weapons are Morocco
and Nigeria.]{.underline} It seems that [suggestions linking China's BRI
project]{.underline}, its [military base in Djibouti, and]{.underline}
increased [military engagement]{.underline} in the related countries
**[are not founded on arms transfers]{.underline}** evidence. [The main
focus on of Chinese arms exports remains to]{.underline} its close
neighbours. Since 2008, [Pakistan]{.underline} (40%) [and
Bangladesh]{.underline} (13%) together account for over half of all
China's major weapons exports. Add in Myanmar, and it's a picture where
**[China usually sells weapons to countries that the West]{.underline}**
(the US and Western Europe) **[does not]{.underline}**. Such sales are
partly due to less stringent human rights conditions linked to arms
sales and more affordable weapons, but also recognising the gaps left by
the US and thus securing greater geopolitical influence as part of its
foreign policy. [Comparing]{.underline} the types of [weapons sold to
African and Asia]{.underline} countries reinforces the argument further.
[Large ticket items exported to Bangladesh and Pakistan]{.underline}
include frigates, corvettes, submarines, and air defence systems. In
addition to the transfer of the weapon, such transactions (sales and
military aid) include training, [maintenance, and exchange of
information on the capability of the weapons]{.underline}. All of [which
enhances]{.underline} country [relationships and boosts]{.underline}
future [collaborations.]{.underline} [In contrast, weapons exports to
Africa are]{.underline} mostly [of lower value]{.underline} in the form
of armoured personnel carriers (APCs), light training aircraft, battle
tanks and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). **[These are akin to one-time
transactions, with limited commitments to training or
maintenance.]{.underline}** While the ability to buy expensive high-tech
weapons is lower in African countries compared to neighbours close to
China, **[China has looked to challenge US influence in
Asia]{.underline}** with more intimate (military and economic) relations
with the likes of Pakistan and Bangladesh. **[The same is not evident in
Africa.]{.underline}** It has been common knowledge that [China has
historically linked arms sales to close neighbours with foreign policy
considerations, extending this]{.underline} to African countries [is far
less straightforward]{.underline}. Although this does not mean China has
no future ambitions to use arms exports as a foreign policy tool,
evidence from arms exports over the past ten years presents a far less
compelling case in the present. Instead, **[China's interests in Africa
seem to remain mainly economic]{.underline}** (e.g., Forum on
China-Africa Cooperation) focusing on trade (China is Africa's largest
trading partner) and investment deals with arms sale transactions in a
demand and supply basis.

#### Arms sales don't produce the leverage China wants

Lowy Institute in Australia and an expert on the Chinese military,

Roggeveen: It is safe to assume that the answer is both, though we
should be careful not to confuse commercial with economic. [All arms
spending is]{.underline}, in purely economic terms[, wasteful, since
military arms]{.underline} either [go unused or are used in]{.underline}
massively expensive [wars.]{.underline} **[Exporting arms can only
defray that cost.]{.underline}** **[Nor should we assume]{.underline}**
that [arms **sales**]{.underline} necessarily [**produce** political
**leverage** or]{.underline} even closer [political ties]{.underline}.
Sweden is one of the most [successful arms exporter]{.underline}s in the
world, [yet it is not obvious]{.underline} that [this has had political
payoffs. Australia]{.underline}, which tends to buy American,
[has]{.underline} also [closed]{.underline} huge arms [contracts with
European manufacturers, but its relations with Europe are]{.underline}
slowly becoming [more distant]{.underline} as Australia embraces its
geography and takes in more Asian immigrants. One last skeptical note:
[**Arms importers have leverage of their own**, which they]{.underline}
regularly [exploit for political purposes. The]{.underline} recent [sale
of Chinese]{.underline} JF-17 [fighters to Myanmar,]{.underline} for
example, [was followed]{.underline} just this week [by]{.underline} news
that [Myanmar]{.underline} is [buying]{.underline} six SU-30 [fighters
from Russia. The message to Beijing ought to be clear**: Myanmar is not
a Chinese client state, and if you push us**]{.underline} too hard **[we
can take our money elsewhere.]{.underline}**

Roggeveen: In strategic terms, [the most significant arms
export]{.underline} to Asia that [China has ever conducted
is]{.underline} still its [transfer of nuclear weapons
tech]{.underline}nology [to Pakistan]{.underline}. Next to that**[,
everything else pales]{.underline}** for two reasons. First, [the scale
of Chinese conventional weapons exports]{.underline} to the rest of Asia
[remains]{.underline} relatively [modest]{.underline}---though, as the
SIPRI figures show, it is clearly growing. But second, if China were not
exporting weapons to Asia, countries would simply be purchasing them
from elsewhere. Granted, China's presence in the market creates
competition, presumably driving down prices and improving overall
quality. But the conventional weapons Beijing is offering to the market
are in ready supply, whereas nuclear weapons technology is much harder
to come by. For those reasons, I **[doubt Chinese arms sales make a huge
contribution to Beijing's ambitions]{.underline}** for greater regional
influence, [particularly in contrast to]{.underline} its signature
initiative, known as [One Belt, One Road. China is offering]{.underline}
fast, large-scale [infrastructure support, which]{.underline} other
players such as [the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and bilateral
donors do not provide.]{.underline} The [connections these projects
create with China are physical and can generate economic
markets]{.underline} that are painful to disturb, so they **[are much
more durable than the ties created by arms sales.]{.underline}**

Given this enthusiasm for the global economy, [the image of a
revisionist China that has gained traction]{.underline} in many Western
capitals [is misleading]{.underline}. [Beijing relies on a global
network of trade ties, so it is loath to court direct confrontation with
the United States.]{.underline} Chinese leaders fear---not without
reason---that such a confrontation might cut off its access to U.S.
markets and lead U.S. allies to band together against China rather than
stay neutral, stripping it of important economic partnerships and
valuable diplomatic connections. As a result[, caution, not
assertiveness or aggressiveness, will be the order of the day in
Beijing's foreign policy in the coming years. Even as it continues to
modernize]{.underline} and expand its military, [China will carefully

The liberal world order, which came into being at the end of World War
II under American leadership, has been going through a radical
transformation in recent years mostly owing to China\'s spectacular
rise. In parallel to its increasing material power capability, [China is
also posing fundamental challenges to the normative fabric of the
liberal world order]{.underline}.∂ What are the key characteristics of
China\'s challenge to the liberal world order and whether the growing
confrontation between the established hegemon, the United States, and
the aspiring hegemon, China, will result in the global Armageddon
requires serious attention.∂ For long, U[.S.-led international
organizations have not only enabled Western actors to materialize their
interests across the globe but also perpetuate the core liberal
assumption that there is only one route to modernity and development,
i.e., the Western way]{.underline}.∂ Acting as the gatekeepers to the
Western international community, such international organizations have
long played key roles in the socialization of erstwhile non-Western
states into constitutive norms, rules and values of the Western world.∂
The hope for transformation∂ Since its opening up to the world economy
in the late 1970s, Western powers hoped that China would gradually
transform into a responsible stakeholder of the liberal international
order and adopt its core values, such as consolidation and promotion of
the principles of individual entrepreneurship, democratic way of
government, minimum state involvement in the economy, rule of law, free
trade, the secularization of societal relations and respect for
multiculturalism. The main reason of such optimism was that China
benefited from becoming a part of the capitalist world economy and its
double-digit economic development was long made possible by its economic
interaction with the U.S.∂ However, [it is now the case that China\'s
adoption of capitalist practices has not paved the way for its liberal
democratic transformation and the U.S., under the Obama and Trump
administrations, have begun defining China as a strategic rival that
needs to be contained]{.underline}. [Looking from the American
perspective, the \"strategy of engagement\" has now given way to a
\"strategy of containment.\"]{.underline}∂ At stake now is whether
China\'s evolving approach to liberal international order justifies a
radical change in the American approach toward China, away from
engagement to containment. At closer inspection, it seems that **[the
maintenance of regional and global stability is still in China\'s
national interests]{.underline}**. As of today, particularly given the
protectionist trade war that President Trump has waged on China and
China\'s galloping internal challenges, Beijing is not in a position to
risk the gains of its ongoing development process by adopting a hardline
approach toward the United States and its neighbors.∂ China has the
largest reserves in U.S. dollars and its access to the American market,
technology and foreign direct investment is still important for its
economic modernization. China does not have the luxury of postponing its
transformation into an economy in which Chinese companies produce mainly
technology-intensive high value-added goods and domestic consumption
increases to such an extent that China\'s economic development is not
negatively affected by recessions and contractions in developed Western
economies.∂ The Chinese economy cannot survive long on the principles of
export-led growth and high domestic savings. Besides[, an aggressive
stance against its neighbors will likely push them further closer to the
arms of the United States, thereby tarnishing Chinese attempts at
manufacturing soft power]{.underline}.∂ How to gain a role∂ [China owes
its meteoric rise in global politics to its efforts to become a part of
the capitalist world economy.]{.underline} Its influence in global
politics arises from the intense economic relationships it has developed
with many other countries.∂ China has now become the number one
trading-partner of not only its neighbors to the south and east but also
many developed countries in the West. China is still the global factory
of merchandise goods and it needs to import many raw materials from
abroad because it is a resource-poor country.∂ If [China wants to
benefit from its growing economic relations with other countries, such
as through the Belt and Road Imitative (BRI), the message that Chinese
leaders have long been giving should continue to resonate: China\'s rise
also means the rise of others.]{.underline} For China\'s
\"no-strings-attached\" development aid policy not to be seen imperial,
China\'s economic rise should continue benefiting others as well. The
improvement of infrastructural capacities of the countries on which
China is dependent on for raw materials and to which China exports goods
are in the final analysis in China\'s national economic interests.∂ An
important characteristic of China\'s rise also relates to its
continental size and huge population. Because size matters in
international politics, every small increase in Chinese per capita
income will lift many Chinese people out of poverty and increase
China\'s share in the global economy.∂ Despite the fact the per capita
income in China is still less than \$10,000, China will likely overtake
the United States as the largest economy by no later than the
mid-century. Any war with the United States will certainly postpone this
to much later.∂ Challenge to liberal order∂ [China\'s challenge to the
liberal world order closely varies with its civilizational state
identity and core values of Chinese society]{.underline}, such as a
father-like status of the state in the eyes of people, unitary state
identity, territorial integrity, realpolitik security culture, societal
cohesion, primacy of family bonds over individuality, primacy of state
sovereignty over popular sovereignty, state\'s unquestioned involvement
in economics and social life, primacy of responsible and ethical
statesmanship over electoral legitimacy, resolving conflicts through
societal mechanisms and trust relationships rather than legal
instruments, primacy of hierarchical relations within the society over
egalitarianism and primacy of shame culture over guilt culture.∂
[Another key characteristic of China\'s rise is **that despite all
counter allegations that Chinese foreign policy has turned out to become
more assertive and aggressive over the last decade Chinese leaders seem
to have been following a low key foreign policy orientation by avoiding
rigid positions on global issues unless core national interests are at
stake,**]{.underline} such as the status of Taiwan, Tibet, the Uighur
region, the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Chinese leaders also
avoid taking global responsibilities. [This is a challenge mainly
because the costs of maintaining global stability and providing global
commons will dramatically increase absent the Chinese
contribution.]{.underline} On the other hand, such a reluctant approach
to global governance might suggest that **[China is not resolved to
replace the United States as the global hegemon]{.underline}**.∂ [China
is not openly questioning the established Western liberal order by
either forming anti-Western coalitions of states or doing its best to
make sure that Western-led international organizations do not operate
smoothly]{.underline}.∂ It is for sure that [China, along with many
other rising powers, wants to see that its growing ascendance in global
politics be accommodated institutionally and peacefully]{.underline}.
However, should Western powers decline to accommodate China, the latter
will not hesitate to help establish alternative institutional platforms
under its guidance, such as the Asia Infrastructure and Investment Bank
and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. China values
external democratization of global politics rather than internal
democratization of national politics.∂ The project goal∂ **[Today\'s
China is not pursuing a strategy of global hegemony]{.underline}**.
Defining their empire-state as the Middle Kingdom, Chinese rulers have
never adopted an imperial mission whose essential logic was to help
transform others in China\'s image. Despite that they believed in the
superiority of their civilization, Chinese rulers have never engaged in
an empire-building project whose goal was to bring civilization to
barbarians.∂ The expectation was that others would at some time in the
future accept and respect the legitimacy of China\'s primacy and pay
their tributes to Beijing in return for Chinese benevolence and
rewarding economic relations. Embracing a benign imperial mindset,
today\'s rulers of China want to make sure that a decentralized imperial
order take place, first in East and Southeast Asia, in which China sits
at the center and other states respect the superiority of Chinese values
as well as China\'s centrality in their development.∂ [China is against
the idea of a universal civilization as well as the practices of setting
global standards of human rights. From the Chinese perspective, rules,
values and norms are relative and products of different time and space
configurations.]{.underline} Similar to other great powers, [China hopes
that its values and norms are shared by others. However, it does not
construct its foreign relations on the basis of a normative understating
in that it is China\'s historical and civilizational mission to project
its values abroad.∂]{.underline} On the contrary, Chinese leaders appear
to believe that the main features of Chinese civilizations have already
shaped the dynamics of interstate and transnational relations in East
and Southeast Asia and that the more interdependent economic and
strategic relations China builds with its neighbors, within the
framework of realist Westphalian order, the more leverage Beijing will
have over other capitals.∂ It is probable that its historical,
civilizational and cultural characteristics on one hand and
developmentalist economic philosophy on the other will likely affect
China\'s contemporary foreign and security policies in a more
reconciliatory, benign and cooperative fashion. However, this in no way
suggests that the process of its climbing up the ladder of power will
never cause geopolitical rivalries and conflicts in the years ahead.

#### Chinese rise is peaceful

**Ting, 2019** (Kacee Ting is a practising barrister in Hong Kong and
vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, 7/17/2019,

The rise of the United States from a former British colony to become the
world supreme power was propelled by its profiteering from both warring
sides in world wars, joining the Allies in the later period of World War
II, and orchestrating the downfall and disintegration of the former
Soviet Union. In those decades, China was too poor to warrant any
attention until earlier this century. The US no longer saw China as a
useful source of cheap labor for American multinationals but a potential
threat to future US hegemony. Since about 2005, [the US developed a
covert China containment policy which had two aspects: multi-frontal
containment and internal transformation]{.underline}.∂ One of the
subscribers to this China containment policy, University of Chicago
International Relations Professor John Mearsheimer, told a recent
seminar on Power Politics in the Indo-pacific Region in Poland that,
"...China is more likely to become a counter-weight to the US, who will
not allow a new rival to emerge. Hence, it is trying every means to
contain China's rise.∂ "The US has defeated its rivals time and time
again in the past. This time it is China's turn. China will also be
defeated by the US."∂ But [at the end of the day it boils down to one
central question: "Is it necessary to contain China?"]{.underline}
[Unlike European powers often rising on the ruins of another, the
Chinese nation has stayed away from hegemony despite its economic
preponderance for milleniums.]{.underline}∂ In traditional Chinese
culture, the quest for harmony -- or at times only a simple appearance
of harmony -- is constant: it refers to a balanced relationship between
Men and Society, between Mankind and Nature and among Men. A Chinese
person will consequently feel embarrassed to refuse something bluntly,
because he/she does not want to risk losing face with vis-à-vis or
breaking a "harmonious" ambience, albeit the latter is only a thin
surface. ∂ [The Western world uses a number of ways to resolve problems,
but most of them are bipolar and allow for confrontation, differing
interests or points of view]{.underline}.∂ Westerners are not
necessarily aware of what they have in common because there are degrees
of nuance between a "cards on the table" confrontation, close to
physical assault and a well-conducted negotiation.∂ The Chinese race, by
the great majority, is the Han ethnic group. Han ancestors are the
agricultural tribes emerging from central and eastern Asia and enjoyed
the abundance of land and rich resources. Because of this
self-sufficiency and availability of unlimited resource, the Han ethnics
were very contended and never needed to invade or conquer. ∂ On the
contrary, nomads often invaded the Hans from all other directions greedy
for their richness, forcing the ancient Han ethnics into self-defense
battles against invasion. ∂ Ever since 1840, [China was the victim of
foreign invasion by Western powers and Japan]{.underline} (the First
opium War, the Second Opium War, the War of Resistance Against Japanese
Aggression in World War II) [rather than being a belligerent
hegemon]{.underline}. ∂ In fact, **[China has always been a peace-loving
nation.]{.underline}** The best proof may be the invention and use of
gunpowder. As early as in the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907), there was
written gunpowder formula recorded in the book \"Tai Shang Sheng Zu Jin
Dan Secret\" 《太上聖祖金丹秘訣》. Chinese ancients invented gunpowder
by chance in the pursuit for immortality.∂ Ironically, it is the West
that used gunpowder as weapon against the Chinese who discovered that
thousands of years ago but had never thought to use it to hurt people.
The East used gunpowder to further develop fireworks whereas the West
used gunpowder to make weapons.∂ [From the outset of the trade dispute
with the US, China has taken a passive and defensive attitude
throughout]{.underline}.∂ According to the white paper entitled "China's
Peaceful Development" issued by the Information Office of the State
Council of China in September 2011, China regards itself as a member of
the international community and aims at building of a harmonious world
of durable peace and common prosperity and work with other countries on
international relations and foreign policies. For instance[, China
respects the right of the people of other countries to independently
choose their own social system and path of development, and does not
interfere in other countries' internal affairs.]{.underline} In 2015,
President Xi Jinping reiterated the message that "No matter how strong
its economy grows, China will never seek hegemony, expansion or sphere
of influence." The message has been emphasized time and again since
then.∂ **[The so-called theory of "China Threat" has bedraggled the
world long but only to no avail. China has been taking a path of
peaceful development upholding national sovereignty and territorial
integrity while avoiding the enhancement of national interests through
aggression]{.underline}**.∂ Skeptics like Mearsheimer works on suspicion
and not facts; they relied on speculation rather than analysis; they had
no understanding of the Han ethnic culture but based his conclusion upon
belligerent and confrontational Western way of thought.

#### Chinese transition is [peaceful]{.underline} \-- 

**Harris 14** (Peter, contributor to the National Interest and
newsletter editor for the International History and Politics section of
the American Political Science Association, 2014, "Problems with
Power-Transition Theory: Beyond the Vanishing Disparities Thesis", Asian
Security, p. 253-254)//EAW

It should be noted that [[power-transition theorists]{.mark} tend to
argue that rising states will be the ones to initiate hegemonic war with
a declining state rather]{.underline} than the other way around. [There
are actually several assumptions embedded in this claim]{.underline}
that a vanishing disparity in power will cause a rising state to
initiate war with a declining state. First, [Organski [assume]{.mark}s
that [there]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [distributional]{.mark}
[consequences]{.mark} [to how the international order is
organized]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} which create material
incentives for states to compete over its form. Second, [because
dominant states are presumed to have had a hand in constructing the
extant international order]{.underline}, such states always benefit
disproportionately from their dealings with others in the international
system, receiving "the greatest share of the benefits that flow from the
existence of the international order," and thus have a rational
self-interest in maintaining the status quo. Third, [Organski
[assume]{.mark}s [that]{.mark} [rising]{.mark} [states]{.mark}
invariably [stand]{.mark} [to gain from changing the status quo]{.mark}
[because a new international order would serve them better]{.mark} than
the extant one]{.underline}. Fourth, [Organski implies that
international order can be remade by rising states---]{.underline}that
is, world order is sufficiently malleable such that a newly dominant
state could have significant influence over its shape if that rising
state is able to displace or unseat the established hegemon. Fifth, [war
against the preexisting hegemon is cost-effective for the rising state
or group of states]{.underline}---that is, the benefits of usurping a
dominant state via force outweigh the costs of waging hegemonic war.∂
Viewed through the lens that Organski has bequeathed, then, Thucydides's
trap is a lethal contraption indeed. Consider, for example, its
application to the contemporary and anticipated rise of China. China is
the third largest country in the world by area and the first biggest by
population. Its economy has grown rapidly for decades and is forecast to
overtake that of the United States at some point during this century.
[[China is already the world's largest trading nation, its biggest
producer of steel, and the second biggest consumer of
oil]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its voracious appetite for raw materials spurs
economic growth in countries on its periphery and farther afield.
Beijing's economic policy is geared towards the urbanization and
industrialization of what has historically been a primarily agrarian
society. While its GDP per capita is still quite low relative to other
industrialized economies, this only portends the distance that China
still has to go and foretells the enormous latent potential that the
country still has at its future disposal. In short, [China
[already]{.mark} [surpasses the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[on]{.mark} some of Organski's key measures of [national]{.mark}
[power]{.mark} and is almost certain to eclipse its rival along his
other dimensions in due course.]{.underline} What is more, neither the
United States nor any other world power seems capable of doing much to
halt China's rise. At some point---namely, the point at which Chinese
power comes close to eclipsing that of the United States---Organski's
formulation of power-transition theory would clearly predict that
conflict between the United States, China, and their respective allies
will ensue. China is destined to want to change the extant world order,
which unambiguously is the product of the United States and its liberal,
maritime-capitalist, Anglo-Saxon predecessor as world hegemon, the
British Empire. The scene is set for a Great Power showdown of epic
proportions.∂ It would be remiss not to mention, however, that Organski
acknowledges in World Politics that his theory of power transitions does
not explain all historical cases of interest. In particular, Organski
highlights the Anglo-American power transition of the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries as the "one major exception that bears
examination." As noted in the introduction, the United States surpassed
the British Empire in financial, industrial, and military terms in a
mostly peaceful fashion. Organski speculates that this peaceful power
transition occurred because of several unique circumstances: unlike
other rising states, the United States did not seek world leadership;
the United States' growth in power was due to the development of its
internal provinces and was thus non-threatening to external powers; the
United States was accepting of the extant Anglo-French international
order; and, in any case, London was powerless to prevent the inevitable.
Each of these conjectures could have been modeled by Organski as
intervening variables---general conditions that might hold in other
power-transitional dyads and not just the Anglo-American case, factors
that might blunt the causal predictions of the vanishing disparities
thesis. As it is, however, Organski in World Politics and his subsequent
work does little more than discuss these factors as anomalies to explain
the Anglo-American outlier. In general terms, peaceful power transitions
should not be expected; Organski's power-transition theory does
not---indeed, cannot---explain their occurrence.

But beyond China's relationships with its customers, I think there is a
strategic agenda. [China wants be a world power, and this ambition is
being advanced largely through technological means]{.underline}. China
clearly wants to compete with Boeing and Airbus as a maker of civilian
airliners, and it has an equally ambitious space program. [It is also
focused on leading the way in artificial intelligence and computer
technology.]{.underline} China wants to be a world-class manufacturer of
weapons, too, and if it is going to make these weapons for its own armed
forces, it might as well export them. WPR: What are the implications of
Chinese arms sales in its immediate spheres of influence? Roggeveen: In
strategic terms, the most significant arms export to Asia that China has
ever conducted is still its transfer of nuclear weapons technology to
Pakistan. Next to that, everything else pales for two reasons. First,
[the scale of Chinese conventional weapons exports to the rest of Asia
remains relatively modest]{.underline}---though, as the SIPRI figures
show, it is clearly growing. But second, [if China were not exporting
weapons to Asia, countries would simply be purchasing them from
elsewhere]{.underline}. Granted, China's presence in the market creates
competition, presumably driving down prices and improving overall
quality. [But the conventional weapons Beijing is offering to the market
are in ready supply]{.underline}, whereas nuclear weapons technology is
much harder to come by. For those reasons, [I doubt Chinese arms sales
make a huge contribution to Beijing's ambitions for greater regional
influence, particularly in contrast to]{.underline} its signature
initiative, known [as One Belt, One Road.]{.underline} China is offering
fast, large-scale infrastructure support, which other players such as
the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and bilateral donors do not
provide. The connections these projects create with China are physical
and can generate economic markets that are painful to disturb, so [they
are much more durable than the ties created by arms sales]{.underline}.

[Why has armed conflict declined to historically low
levels]{.underline}? What accounts for the post-Cold War peace, and how
long is it likely to last? Surely no questions are more important for
either the theory or practice of international relations, and few are
harder to answer. Only by understanding the causes of the New Peace can
we extrapolate its likely future, however, and plan accordingly. Of the
many possible independent variables, [none is more controversial than
the suggestion that hegemonic stability is at work. The possibility that
the United States]{.underline}, wittingly or not, [has essentially
established a global Pax Americana is generally overlooked by the major
scholarly works on the subject]{.underline}. This stands in stark
contrast to the policy world, where the [many positive aspects of
unipolarity and/or US hegemony are articles of faith, rarely discussed
and never seriously questioned]{.underline}. Scholar and public
intellectual Michael Lind spoke for many when he wrote, "in my
experience, most members of the U.S. foreign policy elite sincerely
believe that the alternative to perpetual U.S. world domination is chaos
and war." 4 One of those is certainly Robert Kagan, who noted, "Pinker
traces the beginning of a long-term decline in deaths from war to 1945,
which just happens to be birthdate of the American world order. The
coincidence eludes him, but it need not elude us."5 This paper examines
the theoretical, empirical, and psychological foundations of that
widespread belief. The first section discusses the New Peace and its
potential explanations; the second explains the difference between
unipolarity and hegemony, and examines the logic of the
hegemonic-stability argument; the third turns to the evidence, comparing
both US power and grand strategy to conflict levels; the fourth examines
the political psychology of hegemony and reviews some major findings
that provide insight into how international order can be misperceived.
Insights from that field are crucial in any discussion of the
relationship between US power and global stability, which is built far
more on belief and perception than evidence. [The New Peace does not
appear to be the result of unipolarity or US hegemony]{.underline}.
[While that conclusion might not sit well with many US analysts, the
news is not all bad, for if the current generation of declinists is
right and unipolarity's days are numbered, the odds are good that the
world will not descend into the atavistic chaos that haunts the
neoconservative imagination.]{.underline} [The United States can adjust
its grand strategy without fear in the Trump years, perhaps even letting
the "unipolar moment" expire,]{.underline} because the New Peace may
well be unrelated to its dominance.6

### AT: Petro-Yuan Impact

#### Petro-yuan impact is bunk

International Politics at the London School of Economics\

Fantasy,\" Apr 26,

China\'s recent introduction of yuan-denominated oil futures has
attracted some fairly extensive press commentary. Partly this is down to
a habit of over-interpreting everything happening in China as just more
evidence of their unstoppable rise to global superpower status, but it
is also due to some profound misconceptions about the importance of oil
as a commodity. [It is widely thought, for example, that oil somehow
underwrites the global financial system and guarantees the U.S.
dollar\'s hegemonic status. Inevitably, stories about the toppling of
the \"Petro-dollar\"]{.underline} and the long yearned for rise of an
alternative reserve currency, one not dependent on the whims of a
capricious political elite in Washington, [have
proliferated]{.underline} across the alter-net and on the state-backed
media platforms of Russia and China. But we should be clear[**: the
Petro-dollar does not exist,** and really hasn\'t done in any meaningful
way]{.underline} since the 1970s, [therefore the \"Petro-yuan\" has no
future.]{.underline} This is not to say that oil will never be traded in
yuan, that is likely, but i[t is to say that trading oil in yuan will
not suddenly transform the currency into the global reserve many claim
is inevitable.]{.underline} Origins Of The Petro-Dollar The myth of the
Petro-dollar comes from efforts in the 1970s to prevent the U.S.
suffering severe negative effects in its balance of payments from rising
oil prices. Until the late 1960s the U.S. had been an oil-exporter, but
by also being an oil consumer they had never sought to maximize the rent
from oil production by driving prices upwards. OPEC countries, however,
never had such qualms and when the opportunity arose as the U.S. became
an importer, happily restrained supply to drive prices, and their own
national incomes, higher. The U.S. was worried about the resultant trade
deficit caused by suddenly having to pay vast amounts for necessary
imports, and so secured the agreement of Saudi Arabia to only trade oil
in U.S. dollars, meaning the U.S. could pay for oil in their own
currency. Saudi Arabia, for their part, accumulated huge reserves of
U.S. dollars, investing some of them back into the U.S. economy. The
enormous lake of U.S. dollars this created augmented the role of the
dollar as the global reserve currency, being a highly liquid,
easily-exchanged claim on the products, services and investment
potential generated by the U.S. economy. But this was merely one step in
the rise of the greenback as the global reserve. The next step came when
other economies--East Asia in particular--followed the lead of the oil
producers and also built up huge reserves of U.S. dollars, all of which
was made possible by the abandonment of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange
rate system in the early 1970s. This practice helped to keep exchange
rates for exporters low, and kept a lid on inflation in the U.S., which
suited everyone up to a point. Future Petro-Yuan? Bringing this up to
date, it was a long time ago when the link between oil and the dollar
mattered much at all beyond the financial returns of non-dollar based
oil companies. Since the 1980s, the dollar has been consolidated as the
global reserve currency because of the strength and dynamism of the U.S.
economy, and oil exporters have demanded to be paid in U.S. dollars
because that\'s the currency they prefer to hold on to. To do otherwise
is to take on exchange risk. Exporters can, and routinely do, accept
payment in whatever exchange medium they wish \-- tanks, planes and
construction services \-- but their central banks demand dollars for
reasons entirely unconnected to oil. Because the U.S. dollar is a hard
currency, easily exchangeable, underwritten by the U.S. taxpayer, and
founded upon decades of broadly consistent macro-economic policy
management. Those who believe that oil being traded in U.S. dollars
gives the U.S. economy a unique advantage in the global economy have it
exactly the wrong way around. The U.S. economy is the central economy in
the global system because it is the most open, innovative, and
productive economy in the world, and because of this, the U.S. dollar is
the most convenient, liquid and reliable medium of exchange. One can
imagine another currency challenging it at some point in the future, but
only on the basis of the openness of its underlying economy, and the
depth of the capital markets denominated in it. And if the euro can\'t
do it yet, why does anyone imagine the yuan is up to the job?
Furthermore, the U.S. dollar\'s position as the global reserve currency
has been underwritten by Chinese economic policy. China has deliberately
built up a huge pile of U.S. dollar-denominated reserves which, contrary
to much press coverage and occasional threats of a big selloff from
China, confirms rather than undermines the dollar\'s status.
Yuan-Denominated Oil Futures? When China, like any other economy, allows
the trading of oil futures in yuan, the contract merely promises dated
delivery of oil in exchange for yuan. The contract does not supply the
oil, it does not forward the yuan to an oil producer, it is merely a
transaction that allows a buyer guaranteed delivery of oil by paying for
it in yuan. The counter-party has to supply the oil in exchange for the
yuan. Somewhere along the supply-chain someone will be paying in U.S.
dollars, unless the ultimate supplier wishes to hold yuan. And despite
the fanfare over the last few years, [the yuan still comprises a tiny
share of foreign exchange reserves held globally.]{.underline} Indeed,
[at 1.1% of the total, the yuan is significantly behind both the
Australian and Canadian dollars]{.underline}, meaning that--with pound
sterling--Queen Elizabeth II\'s head appears on 7.5 times more foreign
currency reserves than Mao\'s. [If China wants to change that, it will
need to open up its economy, liberate its capital account and start
living up to, rather than repudiating, its reform promises]{.underline}.
Shanghai-traded oil futures in themselves have nothing to do with it.
