[Contemporary evolutionary theorists offer excellent arguments for
**explaining**]{.underline} some of the human **[behavior expected by
realism]{.underline}**. Particularly interesting are those in the
subdiscipline of evolutionary theory known as sociobiology, the study of
human behavior from the perspective of evolutionary theory.31 Thus far,
however, realists have not used evolutionary theory to place
[realism]{.underline} on a stronger foundation.32 After briefly
reviewing the evolutionary process, I discuss how it [**can explain the
origins of egoism and domination and why it is a better ultimate cause
of realist behavior** than those put forth by Niebuhr and
Morgenthau]{.underline}.33 the process of evolution[. In evolutionary
theory]{.underline}, Homo sapiens, or [the]{.underline} anatomically
modern [human, is]{.underline} an animal, and [like]{.underline} all
[animals behaves as ~~he~~ does \[they do\] as a result of]{.underline}
evolution by [natural selection]{.underline}.34 The essence [of
evolution by natural selection is that most behavioral characteristics
of a species evolve because they help the species survive and
reproduce]{.underline}.35 According to philosopher of biology Elliott
Sober, [there are three constituents of this process]{.underline}.36
[First,]{.underline} there must be [genetic variation]{.underline} in
the species. If all individuals are the same, then there is no basis for
change. Gene frequencies, however, alter regularly through genetic
drift, migration, mutation, and natural selection.37 Thus for sexually
reproducing species, only identical twins (or other monozygotic multiple
births) are truly identical; all others possess differences. [Second,
genetic variation must improve what biologists term
"fitness]{.underline}": A member of a species is at if it is better able
to survive and reproduce---hence the term "survival of the fittest."38
These individuals will be better represented in the next generation than
those less at. [Finally, there must be heritable variation in
fitness:]{.underline} The characteristic must be passed from parent to
offspring.39 [According to evolutionary theory, human behavioral
traits]{.underline} (the genetic causes of human behavior) [evolve and
genes that increase fitness spread though the population. By displaying
these traits, an individual stands a better chance of surviving long
enough to reproduce and of having her genes represented in the next
generation.]{.underline}

#### Genetic analysis and Darwinian evolution suggests that in the face of survival countries only act for self-preservation

Realism, and International Politics*, 130-131 // NC)

[Evolutionary theory offers two sufficient explanations for the trait of
egoism]{.underline}. [The first]{.underline} is a classic Darwinian
argument: [In a hostile environment where resources are
scarce]{.underline} and thus survival precarious, **[organisms typically
satisfy their own physiological needs]{.underline}** for food, shelter,
and so on **[before assisting other]{.underline}**. [In]{.underline}
times of [danger or great stress, an organism]{.underline} usually
places its life---[its survival]{.underline}---**[before that of other
members]{.underline}** of its group, be it pack, herd, or tribe. For
these reasons, [egoistic behavior contributes to fitness.]{.underline}
Evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins's [selfish gene theory provides
the second]{.underline} sufficient [explanation for egoism]{.underline}.
A conceptual shift is required here because Dawkins's level of analysis
is the gene, not the organism. As Dawkins explains, at one time there
were no organisms, just chemicals in a primordial "soup."42 [At first,
different types of molecules started forming by accident]{.underline},
including some that could reproduce [by using]{.underline} the
constituents of the soup---[carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and
oxygen]{.underline}. [Because these constituents were in limited supply,
molecules competed for them as they replicated]{.underline}. From this
competition, the most efficient copy makers emerged. [The process,
however, was never perfect]{.underline}. Sometimes mistakes were made
during replication, and occasionally these accidents resulted in more
efficient replication or made some other contribution to fitness[. One
such mistake might have been the formation of a thin membrane that held
the contents of the molecule together---a primitive cell.]{.underline} A
second might have involved the division of the primitive cell into ever
larger components, [organs,]{.underline} and so on to create [what
Dawkins calls "survival machines]{.underline}." He explains, "The first
survival machines probably [consisted of nothing more than a protective
coat]{.underline}. But making a living got steadily harder as new rivals
arose with better and more effective survival machines. Survival
machines got bigger and more elaborate, and the process was cumulative
and progressive."43 [From a genetic perspective, there is no
intentionality in this process]{.underline}, but it continued
nonetheless because of evolution. [Dawkins makes clear, however, that
the interests of the gene and the organism need not coincide at
different stages in an organism's life, particularly after
reproduction]{.underline}.44 In general, however, **[the selfishness of
the gene increases its fitness, and so the behavior
spreads.]{.underline}**

### 2AC/1NC -- Egotism = Evolutionary

#### Evolutionary biology explains egotism

[Evolutionary theory offers a powerful explanation for]{.underline} the
trait of [egoism]{.underline} (by which we mean the nonpejorative
definition of ''self-regarding, prompted by selfinterest'').86 [Given
competition for limited resources and threats from predators and the
environment]{.underline}, **[an individual organism is primed to seek
its own survival]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}---the Darwinian bottom
line---[reproductive success. The]{.underline} [organism has
to]{.underline} [ensure that its physiological needs]{.underline} (for
food, water, shelter, and so on) [are satisfied so that it can survive
and reproduce]{.underline}. The imperative for [survival in a hostile
environment]{.underline} also [requires that an individual organism
places its survival]{.underline}, **[especially in a time of danger or
stress]{.underline}**, [above the survival of others.]{.underline} The
[genes of egoistic individuals]{.underline} [survive and spread at the
expense of those that fail to]{.underline} effectively [put their own
interests first]{.underline}. Of course, [cooperation]{.underline} and
helping behaviors are common in nature, but such behaviors **[persist
only where they help the genes causing that behavior to
spread]{.underline}**. Genes obviously do not ''want'' or ''try'' to
spread, but the machinery of [natural selection]{.underline} **[means
that self-serving alleles will generally increase in relative
frequency]{.underline}** in the population over time, at [the expense of
alleles]{.underline} [that are neutral or self-sacrificing]{.underline}
for no return benefit. Evolutionary theorists now recognize, following
William Hamilton's concept of ''inclusive fitness,'' that egoism has
complexities. Darwin himself envisioned these nuances, even though he
did not know the biological mechanisms at work. Hamilton used genetic
models to show that, [while individual organisms are egoistic, **they
should be less so in their behavior toward genetic
relatives**]{.underline}, especially in parent-offspring and sibling
relationships.87,88 **[This decrease in egoism is because close
relatives share many of the same genes]{.underline}**---one-half for
siblings and parents, one-quarter for aunts, uncles, and grandparents,
and one-eighth for cousins. [An individual's Darwinian
fitness]{.underline} therefore [includes the success of related
others]{.underline} (hence the phrase inclusive fitness). The preeminent
evolutionary theorist J.B.S. [Haldane]{.underline} thus [quipped that he
would give his life to save two of his brothers]{.underline} (each
sharing half of his genes) [or eight of his cousins]{.underline} (each
sharing one-eighth of his genes).89,90 **[Inclusive fitness provides a
biological basis for the common intuition that individuals favor those
who are close genetic relatives]{.underline}**.91 [Evolutionary theory
accounts for egoism]{.underline} [and explains why cooperation can
extend to the family or close kin group]{.underline} **[but remains
difficult between unrelated individuals]{.underline}**. [Cooperation
among unrelated individuals]{.underline} **[is]{.underline}**
**[possible but only as the result of interactions that help genes
replicate in the long run]{.underline}**, [through mechanisms such as
reciprocal altruism]{.underline}, [indirect]{.underline} [reciprocity,
and signaling]{.underline}.92 [**Even cooperation**]{.underline} and
helping behavior, therefore, **[are strategies that increase an
individual's Darwinian fitness]{.underline}**---indeed, that is
precisely why they evolved.93 In nature, [genetic egoism is the basis of
natural selection.]{.underline}

#### Realism's thesis of egotism is supported by the evolutionary advantage of selfishness

Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict, University Press of Kentucky, 2004.

[Evolutionary theory offers two sufficient explanations for the trait of
egoism]{.underline}. The first is a classic Darwinian argument: Darwin
argued that [an individual organism is concerned for its own survival in
an environment where resources are scarce]{.underline}. [It has to
ensure that its physiological needs-for food, shelter, and so on-are
satisfied so that it can continue to survive.]{.underline} The
**[concern for survival in a hostile environment also requires that in a
time of danger]{.underline}** or great stress **[an individual organism
usually places its life]{.underline}**, its survival, **[above that of
other members of the social group]{.underline}**, the pack, herd, or
tribe.53 For these reasons, [egoistic behavior contributes to
fitness]{.underline}. The selfish gene theory of evolutionary theorist
Richard Dawkins provides the second sufficient explanation for egoism.
As I discussed in chapter 1, Dawkins focuses his analysis on the gene,
not the organism. Beginning with chemicals in a primordial \"soup,\"
different types of molecules started forming, and in time efficient copy
makers emerged.54 They made mistakes, however, and these contributed to
fitness, such as the formation of a thin membrane that held the contents
of the molecule together to become a primitive cell. Over time, these
\"[survival machines]{.underline}\". [became more sophisticated due to
evolution]{.underline} Some cells became specialized, creating organs
and ultimately animal bodies. But again, as I stressed in the previous
chapter, there is no intentionality in this process. Genes did not want
to create or inhabit people, but the process continued nonetheless. The
fundamental point here is that \"[selfishness\" of the gene increases
its fitness, and so the behavior spreads.]{.underline} [The gene creates
an instinctual or genetic basis for egoism **because it is concerned
only with satisfying its wants,**]{.underline} principally reproduction
and food consumption. The organism evolved largely to satisfy the wants
of the gene, and in a similar manner egoism evolves through a
population. Egoism thus becomes a trait or adaptation in animals, such
as humans, that aids survival. Evolutionary theorists now recognize, as
a result of William Hamilton\'s idea of inclusive fitness, that egoism
is more complex than Darwin envisioned. Hamilton recognized that
[individuals are egoistic, but less so in their behavior toward genetic
relatives]{.underline}, in parent-offspring and sibling relationships.
This is [**because close relatives share at least fifty percent of their
genotype-one-half for siblings and parents**, one-quarter for aunts,
uncles, and grandparents, and one-eighth for cousin]{.underline}s. As
the great evolutionary theorist J.B.S. Haldane wrote in 1955, [the gene
that inclines a man to jump into a river to save a drowning
child,]{.underline} and thus to take a one-in-ten chance of dying,
[could flourish as long as the child were his offspring or
sibling]{.underline}. 55 The gene could also spread, albeit more slowly,
if the child were a first cousin, since the cousin shares an average of
oneeighth of his genes. Indeed, Haldane captured this point well when he
wrote that he would give his life to save two of his brothers (each
sharing half of his genotype) or eight of his cousins (each sharing
one-eighth of his genotype). As a result of the ideas of Darwin,
Dawkins, and Hamilton, [evolutionary theory provides an explanation for
what is commonly known,]{.underline} that **[individuals favor those who
are close genetic relatives]{.underline}**. Consequently, [complex
social behavior among unrelated individuals]{.underline} **[can be seen
as the interaction of selfish individuals]{.underline}**, and most
evolutionary theorists expect no tendency toward solidarity,
cooperation, or altruism beyond what is in the interests of the animals.
Similarly, [realists]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, as we will see
below, [rational choice theorists]{.underline} [also do not expect
individuals or states to show this type of behavior]{.underline} [beyond
their own self-interest]{.underline}. Thus, [evolutionary
theor]{.underline}y can [explain egoism **and suggests why cooperation
between unrelated individuals is very often difficult**]{.underline} and
remarkably unlike the behavior one encounters within the family.

### 2AC/1NC -- Dominance Hierarchies

#### Dominance behavior and hierarchies are evolutionarily constant across vastly different species

**Johnson, PhD, and Thayer, PhD, 16**

Bradley, Department of Political Science and Geography at UT San Antonio
(2016). The evolution of offensive realism: Survival under anarchy from
the Pleistocene to the present. Politics and the Life Sciences, 35(1),
1-26.)//bc

Evolutionary theory can also explain dominance. Like egoism, [the desire
to dominate is a trait of human nature]{.underline} (which, as with
egoism, we stress does not necessarily apply to every individual or
situation but is a statistical tendency underlying behavior). As
evolutionary economist Robert Frank has explained, [**''Evidence
suggests that we come into the world equipped with a nervous system that
worries about rank.** Something inherent in our biological
makeup]{.underline} **[motivates us to try to improve]{.underline}**,
[or at least maintain]{.underline}, **[our standing against those with
whom we compete]{.underline}** [for important positional
resources]{.underline}.''94 In the context of evolutionary theory,
[dominance usually means that particular individuals]{.underline} in a
social group [have priority of access to resources]{.underline} [in
competitive situations]{.underline}.95 A wide variety of [animals
exhibit a form of social organization called a dominance
hierarchy]{.underline}, in which members of a social group each have a
status rank descending from the alpha male down through all the other
individuals to the lowliest subordinates[. A dominance hierarchy is
created competitively]{.underline}, [often violently, **and is
maintained forcefully**]{.underline}, [but it can]{.underline} serve to
[prevent or reduce]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} within a group
[because it establishes a pecking order that is generally
respected]{.underline}. As with all things in nature, [dominance
hierarchies vary considerably]{.underline}. Hierarchies may be weak or
strong, and ''alpha'' males may sire nearly all offspring or just more
than others. However, what is striking is the prevalence and potency of
dominance in social organization, despite variations in the specifics.
[Dominance behavior]{.underline} **[occurs in thousands of taxonomic
groups ranging from fish and reptiles to birds and
mammals.]{.underline}** Of particular note regarding the impact of
dominance on human behavior are the roles of both phylogeny (a species'
ancestral lineage) and ecology (its adaptations to local conditions).
With regard to phylogeny, [most primates and all the great
apes]{.underline} (the group to which humans belong) [have strong social
dominance hierarchies, and humans are no
exception]{.underline}---**[dominance hierarchies have been extensively
documented among humans in a wide variety of settings and
eras]{.underline}**.96,97,98 With regard to ecology, dominance
hierarchies are a common form of social organization in the kind of
ecological settings in which humans evolved (social groups with
competing interests, variation in power, and finite resources). The
strength of dominance hierarchies in humans is debated and varies
empirically, but such hierarchies are always evident in some form or
other. [Even where dominance hierarchies are actively
suppressed]{.underline}, such as in more egalitarian small-scale
societies, **[suppression itself is evidence of the competition for
status that simmers beneath the surface]{.underline}**.99 In historical
and contemporary societies, **[competition for power is all too
obvious]{.underline}**, and [the quest for status, dominance, and
leadership is ancient and ever present]{.underline}.100,101,102,103
Males of most mammal species are particularly competitive with each
other over females. Indeed, the competition for mates is subject to a
special type of evolutionary selection process---sexual selection, as
opposed to standard natural selection. Reproductive access to females
tends to be highly skewed, with a few males responsible for a large
proportion of progeny. This is because a single male can reproduce with
multiple females, whereas females can usually only reproduce and rear
the offspring of one male at a time, with a long delay before becoming
reproductively available again. In some species, reproductive access is
settled by coercion, in which the strongest male defeats rivals to
dominate a harem. In other species, males cannot coerce females, but the
females are choosy about with whom they mate, leading to selection
pressures for males to demonstrate or signal their quality as attractive
partners. In either case, it is females rather than males that are the
limiting factor in sexual competition, making male competition for
available females intense. Sexual selection has led to costly biological
adaptations, such as fighting, the growth of heavy ''weapons'' (e.g.,
antlers), risky courtship displays, or adornments that signal genetic
quality (e.g., gigantic tails). These types of adaptations not only
consume precious time and energy but can also decrease survival in
other, nonreproductive domains of life (for example, the plumage of male
peacocks limits their ability to fly). Thus, the power of sexual
selection can lead to the evolution of traits that actually damage
survival in order to achieve superiority over other males.104,105
Reproduction trumps survival in evolution. [Sexual selection is
typically responsible for the hierarchical nature of group-living animal
species]{.underline}, including humans, [as males fight for rank and the
reproductive benefits in brings]{.underline}. As we would expect, [this
leads to sex differences in the desire for status.]{.underline} Both
laboratory experiments and real-world observations have identified
empirical differences between men and women in a range of social
behaviors, not least that men tend to have relative-gains, or
''zero-sum'' motivations (wanting to get ahead at the expense of
others), whereas women tend to favor payoff-maximization, or
''variable-sum'' motivations (content to do well even if others also do
well in the process).106,107,108,109 It is well established that
[dominance and statusseeking behaviors]{.underline} [in humans are based
on many of the same biochemical and neurological processes as in other
mammals]{.underline}, **[such as the secretion and uptake of
testosterone and serotonin]{.underline}**, [which modify
status-challenging behavior]{.underline}.110,111 However rational we may
like to think we are, [our judgments and decision-making are
nevertheless influenced by cognitive mechanisms and
biochemicals]{.underline} circulating in our bodies and brains that
relate to dominance behavior.112,113,114,115 Dominance hierarchies need
not only benefit those at the top. An [organized social structure can
help promote the harvesting of resources]{.underline}, [coordinate group
activity, and reduce within-group conflict]{.underline}. Although alphas
in the hierarchy tend to have the highest reproductive success, other
[males may benefit from group membership by gaining protection from
other groups]{.underline}, or by biding their time for a chance to
challenge the alpha male when they become strong enough or old enough.
**[Ethological studies have shown that hierarchical dominance systems
within a primate group's social network can reduce overt
aggression]{.underline}**, [although aggression increases again when the
alpha male is challenged]{.underline}.116,117,118 To summarize, a
species that lives communally could have two broad forms of social
organization. [The group can accept organization with some
centralization of power]{.underline} ([dominance
hierarchies]{.underline}), [or it can engage in perpetual conflict
(''scramble competition''), which incurs costs in terms of time, energy,
and injuries, as well as depriving the group of many benefits of a
communal existence,]{.underline} such as more efficient resource
harvesting.119 Among social mammals, and primates in particular,
dominance hierarchies have emerged as the primary form of social
organization. Thus far, we have emphasized [a state of ''anarchy'' in
evolutionary history]{.underline}, **[in which there was no overarching
power to provide protection from predators]{.underline}**, rivals, or
other threats. **[Egoism and dominance arose as strategies that provided
solutions to achieving survival and reproduction in this
environment]{.underline}**. However, [dominance hierarchies were in some
sense a mechanism by which this anarchy could be
suppressed]{.underline}---at least within the group---to the benefit of
all group members since they share at least some common interests (such
as avoiding conflict). [This collective benefit points to the special
and much more significant role of anarchy at a higher
level]{.underline}---**[anarchy between groups]{.underline}**. As we
show in the next section, competition between groups is especially
significant for human evolution, and for international politics,
precisely because it is at the intergroup level where anarchy reigns
supreme and is much harder to suppress.

#### States' tendencies towards aggression and selfishness are derived from the evolutionary need to maintain dominance hierarchies

**[Evolutionary theory can also explain domination]{.underline}**. Like
egoism, [the desire to dominate is a trait]{.underline}. In the context
of evolutionary theory, **[domination usually means that particular
individuals in social groups have regular priority of access to
resources]{.underline}** in competitive situations. For most social
mammals, [a form of social organization called a dominance
hierarchy]{.underline} [operates most of the time.]{.underline} The
creation of the [dominance hierarchy may be violent and is almost always
competitive]{.underline}. A single leader, almost always male (the alpha
male), leads the group. The ubiquity of this social ordering strongly
suggests that such a [pattern of organization]{.underline} [contributes
to fitness.]{.underline} Ethologists categorize two principal types of
behavior among social mammals in a dominance hierarchy: dominant and
submissive.56 [Dominant mammals have enhanced access to mates, food, and
territory]{.underline}, **[increasing their chances of reproductive
success]{.underline}**.57 **[Acquiring dominant status usually requires
aggression]{.underline}**.58 Dominance, however, is an unstable
condition; to maintain it, [dominant individuals must be willing to
defend their privileged access]{.underline} to available resources as
long as they are able. Evolutionary anthropologist Richard Wrangham and
ethologist Dale Peterson explain why an individual animal is motivated
to vie for dominant status: \"The motivation of a male chimpanzee who
challenges another\'s rank is not that he foresees more matings or
better food or a longer life.\"59 Rather, \"those rewards explain why
\... selection has favored the desire for power, but the immediate
reason he vies for status \... is simply to dominate his peers.\"60
[Dominant animals often assume behavior reflecting their
status]{.underline}. For example, [dominant wolves and rhesus monkeys
hold their tails higher than other members of their group in an effort
to communicate dominance.]{.underline} A dominant animal that engages in
such displays is better off if it can gain priority of access to
resources without having to fight for it continuously.61 [Such signaling
behavior is found among submissive social mammals as well. They often
try to be as inconspicuous as possible]{.underline} and recognize what
is permitted and forbidden given their place in the hierarchy. **[This
behavior shows that the subordinate accepts its place in the dominance
hierarchy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}-at least temporarily-[will
make no effort to challenge the dominant animal.]{.underline}
Ethologists argue that [dominance hierarchies evolve because they help
defend against predators, promote the harvesting of resources, and
reduce intragroup conflict]{.underline}.62 A species that lives
communally has two choices. It can either accept organization with some
centralization of power, or engage in perpetual conflict over scarce
resources, which may result in serious injury and deprive the group of
the benefits of a communal existence, such as more efficient resource
harvesting.63 Ethological studies have confirmed that a hierarchical
dominance system within a primate band minimizes overt aggression and
that group aggression often increases when the alpha male is
challenged.64 For primates and especially humans, the dominance
hierarchy may have produced a fortuitous result: great intelligence.65
As cognitive psychologist Denise Dellarosa Cummins argues, it has had a
profound effect on human evolution: \"[The fundamental components of our
reasoning architectur]{.underline}e [evolved in response to pressures to
reason about dominance hierarchies]{.underline}, the social organization
that characterizes most social mammals.\"66 Her study and others have
found that dominance hierarchies have contributed to the evolution of
the mind, which in turn has contributed to fitness. According to
Cummins, [submissive individuals can detect, exploit, and circumvent the
constraints of domination. If an animal can take what it wants by
force**, it is sure to dominate the available
resources**]{.underline}-[unless its subordinates are smart enough to
outwit]{.underline} [it]{.underline}. To survive, a subordinate must use
other strategies: deception, guile, appeasement, bartering, alliance
formation, or friendship. Thus intelligence is particularly important to
the survival of subordinates. \"[The evolution of mind
emerges]{.underline},\" Cummins writes, \"**[as a strategic arms race in
which the weaponry is ever-increasing mental capacity to represent and
manipulate internal representations of the minds of
others.]{.underline}**\"67 From their studies of chimpanzee societies,
ethologists have learned that the struggle for survival is best
characterized as a struggle between those who are dominant and those
seeking to outwit them, i.e., between recognizing an opponent\'s
intentions and hiding one\'s own. The following example illustrates how
a subordinate chimpanzee, Belle, who knows the location of hidden food,
attempts to deceive Rock, who is dominant: Belle accordingly stopped
uncovering the food if Rock was close. She sat on it until Rock left.
Rock, however, soon learned this, and when she sat in one place for more
than a few seconds, he came over, shoved her aside, searched her sitting
place, and got the food. Belle next stopped going all the way \[to the
food\]. Rock, however, countered by steadily expanding the area of his
search through the grass near where Belle had sat. Eventually, Belle sat
farther and farther away, waiting until Rock looked in the opposite
direction before she moved toward the food at all, and Rock in turn
seemed to look away until Belle started to move somewhere. On some
occasions Rock started to wander off, only to wheel around suddenly
precisely as Belle was about to uncover some food \.... On a few trials,
she actually started off a trail by leading the group in the opposite
direction from the food, and then, while Rock was engaged in his search,
she doubled back rapidly and got some food. 68 [Despite the \"arms
race\" described by Cummins to outwit dominance, the subordinate members
of the group continue to participate]{.underline} in the dominance
hierarchy **[because doing so increases the chances of
survival]{.underline}**. As ethologist David Barash explains**[, if
subordinates \"are more fit by accepting]{.underline}**\"
[subordinate]{.underline} \"[ranking than by refusing to
participate]{.underline}, **[then some form of social dominance
hierarchy will result]{.underline}**.\"69 Humans and other primates
evolved a mental architecture to address the difficulties they
encountered in dominance hierarchies. These problems, which \"directly
impact survival rates and reproductive success,\" include two crucial
needs: \"the necessity to recognize and respond appropriately to
permissions, obligations, and prohibition,\" and the necessity \"to
circumvent the constraints of hierarchy by dint of guile, particularly
through successfully forecasting others\' behavior. \"70 Because [human
mental architecture was created through evolution]{.underline}, **[it
remains part of human behavior today]{.underline}**, as cognitive
psychology studies show. 71

### 2AC/1NC -- Offensive Realism

#### Evolutionary theory explains offensive realism -- egotism, domination, and ethnocentrism are rooted in evolutionary needs

**Thayer, PhD, 4**

Antonio. Darwin and International Relations : On the Evolutionary
Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict, University Press of Kentucky, 2004.

**[Evolutionary theory allows realists to advance offensive realist
arguments without seeking an ultimate cause in]{.underline}** either the
**[anarchic international state system or in theological or metaphysical
ideas]{.underline}**. [Realism based on evolutionary theory reaches the
same]{.underline} [conclusions]{.underline}, [but the]{.underline}
ultimate [causal mechanism is different]{.underline}: human evolution in
the anarchic and perilous conditions of the late-Pliocene, Pleistocene,
and most of the Holocene epochs. Specially, **[evolutionary theory
explains why humans are egoistic]{.underline}**, **[strive to dominate
others, and make ingroup/out-group distinctions]{.underline}**.
**[These]{.underline}** adaptations in turn **[serve as a foundation for
offensive realism]{.underline}**. The central issue here is what causes
states to behave as offensive realists predict. Mearsheimer advances a
powerful argument that anarchy is the fundamental cause of such
behavior. The fact that there is no world government compels the leaders
of states to take steps to ensure their security, such as striving to
have a powerful military, aggressing when forced to do so, and forging
and maintaining alliances. This is what neorealists call a self-help
system: leaders of states are forced to take these steps because nothing
else can guarantee their security in the anarchic world of international
relations. I argue that [evolutionary theor]{.underline}y also
[offers]{.underline} [a fundamental cause for offensive realist
behavior]{.underline}. Evolutionary theory explains why individuals are
motivated to act as offensive realism expects, whether an individual is
a captain of industry or a conquistador. My argument is that **[anarchy
is even more important than most scholars ofinternational relations
recognize]{.underline}**. The [human environment of evolutionary
adaptation was anarchic]{.underline}; **[our ancestors lived in a state
of nature in which resources were poor]{.underline}** a**[nd dangers
from other humans and the environment were great]{.underline}**-so great
that it is truly remarkable that a mammal standing three feet
high-without claws or strong teeth, not particularly strong or
swift-survived and evolved to become what we consider human. [**Humans**
**endured because natural selection gave them the right behaviors to
last in those conditions**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} environment
[produced the behaviors examined here:]{.underline} [egoism, domination,
and the in-group/out-group distinction]{.underline}. These specific
[traits are sufficient to explain why leaders will behave,]{.underline}
in the proper circumstances, [as offensive realists expect them to
behave]{.underline}. That is, [even if they must hurt other humans or
risk injury to themselves,]{.underline} **[they will strive to maximize
their power]{.underline}**, defined as either [control over
others]{.underline} (for example, through wealth or leadership) [or
control over ecological circumstances]{.underline} (such as meeting
their own and their family\'s or tribe\'s need for food, shelter, or
other resources). Evolutionary theory explains why people seek control
over environmental circumstances-humans are egoistic and concerned about
food-and why some, particularly males, will seek to dominate others by
maintaining a privileged position in a dominance hierarchy. Clearly, as
the leaders of states are human, they too will be influenced by
evolutionary theory as they respond to the actions of other states and
as they make their own decisions. In this chapter, I have already
discussed these two elements of my argument: that evolutionary theory
allows realist scholars to explain why state decision makers are
egoistic and why those state leaders strive to dominate others when
circumstances permit.s1 These adaptations were critically important in
the course of human evolution and remain a significant ultimate cause of
human behavior. Recalling that [biology is good
probability]{.underline}, [not destiny]{.underline}, [we should expect
that leaders of states and major decision makers will possess these
traits and are not likely to suppress them]{.underline} the way a
saintly individual, like Mother Teresa, might. Indeed, if leaders
suppress them, they are likely doing so only for tactical reasons or as
required by specific circumstances. In fact, [a state\'s
elites]{.underline}-the captains of industry and media, and military and
political leaders-**[are more likely than average to show these traits
in abundance]{.underline}** [since most leaders rise to the top of their
respective hierarchies through a very competitive process]{.underline}.
**[This is almost always the case for political leaders]{.underline}**.
[The rise to the top is the result of an often arduous,]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} perhaps [physically dangerous, proces]{.underline}s[;
those who triumph,]{.underline} whether Mao or Clinton, **[are almost
certain to be egoistic individuals]{.underline}** [who are used to
dominating the individuals]{.underline} or institutions [around them.
Even those who inherit the throne have discovered]{.underline} time and
again **[that keeping it involves almost endless struggle and
sacrifice]{.underline}**. Shakespeare has King Henry remind us in Henry
TV, Part 2 (Act III, scene i), that \"uneasy lies the head that wears a
crown.\" Moreover, the king struggles against internal as well as
external enemies, as the Bard captures so well in Macbeth (Act II, scene
ii) with Macbeth's murder of Duncan, and with his suspicion of what the
murder would cost him: Methought I heard a voice cry, \"Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murther sleep\"-the innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the
ravell\'d sleave of care A third cause of offensive realist behavior in
humans is [the in-group/outgroup distinction]{.underline} commonly made
in psychology, anthropology, and sociology, which I will discuss in more
detail in chapter 5 when I explain the origins of ethnic conflict. The
basic points here are that [humans divide their worldview]{.underline}
[into an \"Us,\" the in-group, versus \"Them,\" the
out-group]{.underline}, in order to simplifY the human mind\'s
information processing. Psychologists refer to the in-group as one\'s
own group, toward which one is positively biased, perhaps a family,
tribe, organization, or state. They argue that in-groups develop from a
need for self-definition, both positive and negative. [The in-group
identity provides people with meaning, purpose, and a sense of
community, but also with knowledge of what they are not-the
out-group]{.underline}. The out-group may also be another family, tribe,
organization, or state.

### 2AC/1NC -- Heuristics Inevitable

#### Heuristics cannot be changed -- evolution and natural selection lock-in responses 

**Petersen, 15**, \[Michael Bang Petersen holds a Phd in Poltical
Science, and is a professor of Politcal Psychology and Behavior\], (Feb
2015, \"\",Political Psychology, Vol. 36, No. S1, Supplement: Advances
in Political Psychology, accessed 7-19-2019), //Snitty

This is the fundamental principle. [Humans evolved as political animals
and, in order to be successful as a species, our minds are required to
come naturally equipped with a number of political
heuristics]{.underline}. **[Political heuristics cannot be presumed to
be \"learned\" in the sense of logically deduced or acquired through
explicit instruction]{.underline}**. [To anyone interested in
understanding political heuristics, this should be a welcome
message.]{.underline} When in Popper\'s (1959) \"context of
discovery\" - the context of hypothesis formulation - [we are no longer
confined to our own fallible intuitions when considering the structure
of political heuristics. Instead, we can utilize one of the best
validated and most powerful scientific theories of all times to
understand the heuristics used by modern citizens: the theory of
evolution by natural selection.]{.underline} In processes of **[natural
selection]{.underline}**, origin - and, in particular, the functional
requirements related to this origin - **[determines
structure]{.underline}**. Hence, by (1) utilizing anthropological and
archaeological knowledge to specify the kinds of political challenges
our ancestors have faced, (2) considering the nested representational
and motivational problems that would have needed to be solved in order
to meet these challenges, and (3) considering the evolutionarily
recurrent cues available for these systems to process to reach these
solutions, we can build testable hypotheses on the structure of
political heuristics. Principle 2. [The Function of Many Political
Heuristics Is to Solve Evolutionarily Recurrent Adaptive
Problems]{.underline} In the traditional perspective, the function of
heuristics is to help citizens formulate value- consistent opinions with
minimal cognitive effort. [Evolved heuristics, in contrast, have
numerous, highly different functions; although the overarching goal of
all of them was to help our ancestors survive and reproduce under
evolutionarily recurrent conditions]{.underline}. **[Each heuristic
-]{.underline}** [and its underlying representational and motivational
system]{.underline} - **[is designed by natural selection to solve a
particular problem]{.underline}**. [In this regard, consistency between
values and attitudes or between attitudes expressed at certain points in
time has most likely not been the most important problems facing our
ancestors]{.underline}. [Whenever modern political issues or events
exhibit the cues that would have disclosed a problem under ancestral
circumstances]{.underline}, [we ought to **expect the relevant systems
to come online**]{.underline}. [Our minds are built to infer indirectly
whether an adaptive problem is present from the cues available, and our
mind will presume that the adaptive problem is indeed present if the
appropriate set of cues is present]{.underline}. Cues surrounding social
welfare debates, such as needy individuals requesting help, activate
representational and motivational systems designed for small-scale
social exchange (Petersen, 2012a). [Similarly, cues surrounding criminal
justice debates, such as cost-infliction and malicious intents, activate
representational and motivational systems designed for small-scale
counterexploitation]{.underline} (Petersen, Sell, Cosmides, & Tooby,
2012).

### 2AC/1NC -- Aggression

#### Aggression is [biological]{.underline} --- psychological adaptations determine reactions to conflict

**Klasios**, **19** -- Researcher for York University (John,
\"Aggression among men: An integrated evolutionary explanation\",
Science Direct, July-August 2019, Vol. 47, p. 29-45))SK

\*\*we do not endorse gendered language

A number of [biosocial
[criminologists](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/criminologist)]{.underline}
have attempted to [illuminate aggression]{.underline} (as well as crime
and
[delinquency](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/social-sciences/delinquency)
more generally) [in terms of its
[heritability](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/heritability)]{.underline}.
Here, my aim will be twofold: First, to bridge behavior genetics with
the [explanatory
model](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/psychology/explanatory-model)
developed in this paper, and then to briefly discuss the evolutionary
processes that can act to generate heritable variation in traits
connected to male aggression. [Heritable variation in violent crime has
been established by behavior geneticists]{.underline} (e.g., [Barnes et
al.,
2014](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0050);
[DiLalla & Gheyara,

[Ferguson,
2010](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0250);
[Rhee & Waldman,
2002](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0570)).[7](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#fn0035)
On the one hand, these studies show us how much of the variance in a
given population, at a given time, can be explained by heritable
factors. Yet on the other hand, heritability studies are largely silent
on the mechanistic and developmental details that subserve the
heritability of traits. In order to see how these two sides of the coin
are interrelated, we can start by considering the concept of reactive
heritability, which sketches how heritable traits express or magnify
themselves developmentally (e.g., [Tooby & Cosmides,
1990](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0680);
[von Rueden, Lukaszewski, & Gurven,
2015](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0585)).
[To illustrate how]{.underline} such [processes]{.underline} can [work,
we can consider an example germane to **aggression**, whereby an
individual inherits above **average physical strength**.]{.underline}
From the figurative point-of-view of the underlying psychological
adaptations that govern aggression (broadly speaking), and all else
equal, it is unknown what the level of physical strength is in the
organism that the adaptations are developing and operating in. However,
it is possible that [natural-selection can design]{.underline} such
[adaptations so that they can assess what the agent\'s physical strength
level is]{.underline}---perhaps, for instance, [by attending to feedback
regarding how often, and to what degree, the agent is either successful
or unsuccessful in physical [conflicts of
interest](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/social-sciences/conflict-of-interest)]{.underline}
with other agents. Given these assessments, [the underlying
psychological adaptation can then compute an overall index of the
agent\'s physical strength, and then utilize that index when judging if
and when to instrumentally mete out aggression]{.underline}. Whether
such an adaptation has actually evolved, and, if so, what its design
features are, are of course empirical questions. However,
[**evolutionary psychologists** have]{.underline} indeed [found
experimental evidence that suggests that a psychological adaptation has
evolved in men that can assess one\'s physical strength, and then use
that assessment as an "internal regulatory variable" which
governs]{.underline}, for instance, [one\'s **proneness to use anger**
as a bargaining tactic during conflicts]{.underline} of interest with
other agents ([Sell, Cosmides, et al.,
2009](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0620);

### AT: Cooperation Checks Aggression

#### Group selection/cooperation doesn't check aggression -- evolutionary forces of individual competition are more powerful

**Johnson, PhD, and Thayer, PhD, 16**

(Dominic D. P., PhD from Geneva University in political science, and
Bradley, Department of Political Science and Geography at UT San Antonio
(2016). The evolution of offensive realism: Survival under anarchy from
the Pleistocene to the present. Politics and the Life Sciences, 35(1),
1-26.)//bc

If intergroup conflict is so important, might evolution favor the most
cooperative groups? [Evolution is sometimes argued to operate on groups
rather than individuals]{.underline} (''group selection''). This idea is
important because[, if individuals are working for the good of the
group]{.underline} rather than only for themselves[, then groups
composed of more-cooperative individuals may do better than
less-cooperative groups]{.underline}, meaning that genuinely altruistic
traits (sacrificing one's own interests for the good of others) can
spread in the population.184,185 However, **[there are several reasons
why this possibility does not affect our argument.]{.underline}** First,
**[group selection is a controversial hypothesis]{.underline}**, [which
has been rejected by many prominent evolutionary
biologists]{.underline}.186 While [selection]{.underline} at the level
of groups is possible in principle, it [requires special conditions to
overcome]{.underline} **[what are generally agreed to be the much more
powerful forces of competition and selection acting on
individuals]{.underline}**, and [these forces are always in play whether
groups are in competition with each other or not.]{.underline}
Therefore, even the strongest advocates of group selection, such as
David Sloan Wilson, argue that, in any given case, [it remains an
empirical question as to whether or not the selection pressures acting
at the level of individuals are outweighed by selection
pressures]{.underline} potentially [acting at the level of the
group]{.underline} (so called multi-level selection). While biological
group selection in humans is possible in theory, [there have not been
any published empirical examples]{.underline}. Second, [even if group
selection does occur**, it can only increase altruism within
groups.**]{.underline} Between groups, [group selection would do the
opposite]{.underline}, [maintaining or even exacerbating
conflict.]{.underline}187 Because [the premise is that selection
operates at the level of groups]{.underline}, a[ltruistic traits can
only spread if altruism helps spread the genes responsible for
it]{.underline} at the expense of other genes, and [that must occur via
intergroup competition or conflict]{.underline}. Therefore, [to advocate
group selection]{.underline} over individual selection **[does nothing
to reduce predictions regarding human conflict or
aggression]{.underline}**. If anything, **[group selection would tend to
increase violence]{.underline}**, [since between-group
competition]{.underline} (conflict among strangers) [can be more brutal
than within-group competition]{.underline} (conflict among kin and
fellow group members). In Matt Ridley's words, **[to prefer group
selection over individual selection ''is to prefer genocide over
murder]{.underline}**.''188 Group selection can promote cooperation and
altruism, but only within the group. The dark side of group selection is
the unfettered conflict it presupposes and predicts between groups in
competition with each other. Third, it is important to remember that the
empirical observation of altruism in nature does not imply or demand
group selection. [Given group selection's theoretical
constraints]{.underline}, **[it should be a last-resort
explanation]{.underline}** (subject to empirical testing), not a first
point of call. As we have explained, there are several mechanisms by
which altruistic or helping behavior can (and have) evolved because of
the benefits of helping others that accrue to oneself ---not least,
altruistic behavior among kin, reciprocity, and reputation formation. In
short, [you do not need group selection to explain
altruism]{.underline}. In the right contexts, helping others can help
oneself. The [strategic allocation of resources to others often advances
one's own]{.underline} [Darwinian fitness]{.underline}. **[We do not
need to resort to group selection unless altruism cannot be explained by
more conventional mechanisms]{.underline}** based on individual
selection. George C. Williams famously made this point in response to so
called naïve group selectionists of the time, and his insight has
continued to be reiterated to biology students ever since.189 While
biological group selection among humans is unlikely, the selection of
cultural traits among groups is possible. The constraints on biological
group selection, such as [significant differences in a given
trait]{.underline} between groups and low migration, [are relaxed in the
case of cultural traits,]{.underline} [since groups actively promote
cultural distinctions]{.underline} and have many mechanisms to prevent
flows between them.190 Therefore, [it is]{.underline} not just likely
but [quite apparent that]{.underline} many [cultural traits]{.underline}
have [evolved out of group-level competition]{.underline}---sometimes
referred to as memes, as opposed to genes. (Examples include the spread
of Christianity or Islam at the expense of traditional religions over
the last 2,000 years.) However, once again, the potential for cultural
group selection does not change or challenge our argument. To the extent
that cultural group selection extends back into our evolutionary past,
cultural traits have not been consistently or powerfully contrary to the
evolved traits of egoism, dominance, and ingroup/outgroup bias. Indeed,
cultural selection has often reinforced, not reduced, these very
behaviors over human history. Moreover, and lastly, cultural differences
have themselves represented an additional cause and consequence of
conflict. In addition to fighting over resources, we can now fight over
ideology as well.

#### Intergroup competition and conflict is evolutionarily inevitable -- cooperation only happens when it's beneficial to the individual 

**Johnson, PhD, and Thayer, PhD, 16**

(Dominic D. P., PhD from Geneva University in political science, and
Bradley, Department of Political Science and Geography at UT San Antonio
(2016). The evolution of offensive realism: Survival under anarchy from
the Pleistocene to the present. Politics and the Life Sciences, 35(1),
1-26.)//bc

Humans evolved as a distinct lineage principally in the Pleistocene era
(from 2 million to 10,000 years ago), and our analysis therefore
requires a discussion of the small-scale hunter-gatherer groups that
formed the social and ecological context for that period of human
evolution. Of the many features of hunter-gatherer society and
organization, we focus on intergroup relations, since these are most
relevant to the behaviors associated with international relations.
[While relations within groups might be characterized by coordination
and cooperation]{.underline} (although internal conflict was important
too), **[relations between groups were characterized by competition and
conflict]{.underline}** (although external cooperation and trade was
also possible). A key debate in evolutionary anthropology has revolved
around the origins and extent of intergroup conflict among
huntergatherers, and the emerging consensus is that such conflict is
(and has long been) significant and widespread, and that it serves
adaptive functions.59 Let us first consider these functional advantages.
[Why would hunter-gatherer groups fight at all]{.underline}? What is the
logic for risking life and limb in engaging in violent aggression
against other groups? Conflict may seem costly to all parties involved,
winners and losers alike, but [what matters for natural selection is
whether fighting]{.underline}, [despite its costs, can bring net
benefits to Darwinian fitness]{.underline}. Evolutionary theory would
expect that **[intergroup conflict contributes to fitness in certain
circumstances]{.underline}** [if successful defense and offense against
outgroups yield resources and reduce competition in an environment
defined by finite resources]{.underline}.60,61 A resource is any
material substance that has the potential to increase the individual's
ability to survive or reproduce, such as food, shelter, territory,
coalition allies, and members of the opposite sex.62 What an
evolutionary perspective allows us to understand is that [the origins of
warfare and the functions of warfare are interconnected.]{.underline}
**[The origins of warfare are rooted in the imperative to gain and
defend resources necessary for survival]{.underline}** **[and
reproduction in dangerous and competitive conditions]{.underline}**.
[Competition for resources results in situations where consumption
by]{.underline} [one individual or group diminishes the amount available
for others]{.underline}, or where one individual or group controls the
distribution of resources and thus can deny them to others.63,64 In the
Pleistocene era, [any group facing a shortage of resources]{.underline}
(or a need for more, as the group expands) [could]{.underline} have
adopted one or a combination of three basic strategies. First, the group
could [eliminate or reduce consumption to make the resource last. This
strategy was clearly not an option for critical resources]{.underline},
such as food and water. Second, [the group might seek an alternative for
the resource]{.underline}, [perhaps through technological innovation or
by substitution]{.underline}. In the Pleistocene era, this strategy
could have been an option with some resources but not others. Third,
**[the group could acquire more of the resource from outside of their
territory]{.underline}** **[through migration to uninhabited areas,
trade, theft, or warfare]{.underline}**.65,77,67,68,69,70 Although
**[warfare]{.underline}** is certainly costly to any member of a group
who is killed or wounded, as well as in terms of the resources and time
expended, it **[can become the sole]{.underline}** (or least bad)
**[choice for a group if migration is risky]{.underline}** due to
factors such as inhospitable or unproductive terrain or hostile
neighboring groups, and where trade is difficult or impossible. For
example[, a group seeking a fixed]{.underline} [source of water may be
unable to trade for it if the group lacks adequate resources to offer in
exchange]{.underline}. Warfare might then be necessary for offensive
purposes, to plunder resources from others. [Aggression may be a risky
strategy]{.underline}, **[but it is a more attractive option than
starvation or other lethal dangers]{.underline}**. [Any]{.underline}
given [individual's Darwinian fitness will be increased if they can
successfully seize the resources of others]{.underline} at sufficiently
low cost.71 Of course, warfare also may be waged for defensive reasons,
such as to defend critical resources from the advances of others.72 E.O.
Wilson captures the evolutionary logic succinctly, saying that
[humans]{.underline} would [fight wars]{.underline} ''**[when they and
their closest relatives stand to gain long-term reproductive
success,'']{.underline}** and he continues, ''[despite appearances to
the contrary, warfare may be just one example of the rule that cultural
practices are generally adaptive in a Darwinian sense]{.underline}.''73
An evolutionary approach allows the expectation that contemporary humans
possess specific behavioral traits that contributed to fitness in the
past, including the willingness to fight to retain or gain the resources
necessary so that the individual, the family, and the extended family
group would continue to survive and reproduce.74 Unsurprisingly, direct
evidence of human behavior from the Pleistocene era is rare, but in
addition to archeological finds, we have evidence from recent and
contemporary indigenous societies that offer a model for the behavior of
our distant ancestors, who lived under similar social and ecological
conditions. Napoleon Chagnon's work among the Yanomamo of the Amazon
revealed that [indigenous groups had a constant need to find new
territory as they expanded and split]{.underline}, and [they experienced
a constant fear of other groups]{.underline} [because violent conflict
was a recurring strategy used to stake out a livelihoo]{.underline}d.75
The Yanomamo are just one example of a pattern that extends to a wide
range of indigenous societies around the world.76,77 Across such
societies, around 15 percent of male deaths occurred in warfare, which
compares to a figure of around 1 percent for the United States and
Europe in the so-called bloody 20th century (and in many of those
small-scale indigenous societies, the rate of male deaths from warfare
is much higher than the average figure of 15 percent).78,79 It has been
argued that such high levels of conflict among indigenous societies
might have been caused by pressure from more developed societies
encroaching on their territories and way of life from the outside.
However, a study by Wrangham and Glowacki, which explicitly looked at
warfare among [hunter-gatherers who were surrounded by other
hunter-gatherers]{.underline}, found that [warfare was just as common in
this more ''natural'' setting.]{.underline}80 Evidence from across the
cumulative research of archeologists and anthropologists indicates that
[**violence is a widespread feature of small-scale foraging societies**
and follows a pattern that is consistent as far back as we can see in
the ethnographic and archeological record]{.underline}.81 Wrangham's and
Glowacki's work has also established empirical support for the
evolutionary logic in the patterns of intergroup conflict. Hunter
gatherers have recurrent tendencies, including hostility toward members
of different societies, and for killing to be carried out in relative
safety---that is, only when there is a strong asymmetry in power between
subgroups, such as in a raid or ambush (the ''imbalance of power''
hypothesis). By contrast, as ''rational actor'' theorists would expect,
hunter[-gatherers are averse to the risk of fighting symmetric
battles]{.underline} [with roughly equivalent numbers on each
side.]{.underline}82 Importantly, [sustained instances of imbalances
of]{.underline} [power over evolutionary history]{.underline} **[would
have led to the selection of contingent aggression]{.underline}**. In
other words, [since imbalances of power]{.underline} [offer systematic
opportunities]{.underline} for low-cost aggression over time, [we should
expect human groups to]{.underline} have **[developed a disposition to
act aggressively against others when the opportunity
arises,]{.underline}** because opportunistic aggression is a strategy
that pays off on the average. Indeed, Wrangham and Glowacki find
evidence that after ''**[warriors killed members of a neighboring
society,]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} [killer's group benefited as a
whole via territorial expansion''83]{.underline}--- precisely as has
been shown for intergroup killings by chimpanzees. Chagnon, Wrangham and
Glowacki and others have also shown that [individuals]{.underline}, as
well as the group, [may gain significant reputational and reproductive
advantages of participation in warfare]{.underline}. Although warfare is
a high-stakes collective action problem, **[warriors are willing to
participate because over evolutionary time the dividends have tended to
outweigh the costs]{.underline}**.84,85

## Status Competition

### 2AC/1NC -- Insecurity

#### Status competition arises from insecurity over international credibility and humiliation -- causes military aggression and imperialism

**Barnhart, PhD, 16**

(Joslyn (2016), BA Reed College MA Claremont Mckenna PHD University of
California LA, Status Competition and Territorial Aggression: Evidence
from the Scramble for Africa, Security Studies, 25:3, 385-419, DOI:
10.1080/09636412.2016.1195620) //bc

This theory of status assertion overlaps to some degree with other
status based theories of behavior. [Social Identity Theory]{.underline}
(SIT) [posits that groups want to maintain positive, distinctive
identities]{.underline} [and that an unfavorable comparison with a
reference group engenders a desire to enhance one's
position]{.underline}.35 While [states]{.underline} may choose to seek
status through less competitive strategies such as imitation and social
creativity, they [are more likely to seek status through a strategy of
social competition]{.underline} [when the borders between groups appears
to be "impermeable."]{.underline}36 [Disrespect can be understood
as]{.underline} a signal of impermeability---as [a sign that
higher-status]{.underline} [states are unwilling to accept new
members]{.underline} into their ranks. [Impermeability]{.underline},
however, [suggests a sustained state]{.underline} [of restricted
access]{.underline} over time, [not solely in the form of
disrespect]{.underline}. I argue instead that a single instance of
disrespect may be sufficient to lead states to engage in competitive
assertions of status. Instances of humiliation also increase the
likelihood of competitive strategies, though they are not signals of
boundary impermeability. I also argue that [status-challenged states
with sufficient capabilities are likely to first pursue competitive
strategies over imitation or social creativity]{.underline} for a number
of reasons. First, as suggested above, because [humiliation and
disrespect]{.underline} engender anger, they **[serve as a trigger for
aggressive action]{.underline}**.37 Second, because [competitive
strategies]{.underline} [rely upon established bases of
status]{.underline}, [they are less risky than a strategy of
creativity]{.underline} with which a state may or may not succeed in
establishing new dimensions of status. Finally, [competitive strategies
also enable status-threatened states to send a more targeted signal to
states that have disrespected it than do imitation or
creativity]{.underline}. [This signal]{.underline} often [involves
vigorously]{.underline} [exercising the right or pursuing the exact
interest that the disrespected state was originally denied]{.underline}.
[Wohlforth]{.underline} presents an alternative model, [arguing that a
state will compete for status when it matches higher-status
state]{.underline}s **[in some but not all of the key material
dimensions of status]{.underline}**.38 He argues that [periods of power
transition]{.underline} **[create the conditions for status
ambiguity]{.underline}** in which [states have an incentive to strive
for]{.underline} [preeminence]{.underline}. I argue, however, that while
instances of humiliation and disrespect may be more likely to occur
during shifts in relative capabilities, [states also experience
humiliation and disrespect when the distribution of capabilities is
relatively stable and unambiguous]{.underline}.39 Because of the
difficulty of objectively measuring how one's characteristics rank
relative to others, [states obtain estimates of their
status]{.underline} [through the amount of consideration they receive
from others]{.underline}. [Instances of disrespect allow for
such]{.underline} [estimates and]{.underline} therefore [serve as
triggers for status seeking]{.underline}, whether the underlying
distribution of forces is shifting or not. Finally, realist analyses of
[status competition]{.underline} (for example, Robert Gilpin's War and
Change in World Politics) **[view military aggression as arising from
inconsistency between a state's degree of influence and its military
power as states seek to demonstrate relative military
capability]{.underline}**.40 I argue, in contrast, [that status is
partly]{.underline} but not wholly [based on relative capabilities and
that direct military]{.underline} [conflict is one among many
status-seeking strategies]{.underline}. States need not engage in direct
conflict with rivals or in costly displays of capability or resolve in
order to demonstrate their ranking relative to others. Numerous less
risky and less costly status-seeking strategies, such as the extension
of imperial control or the adoption of policies opposed to dominant
states, are available to humiliated and disrespected states that allow
them to signal the status they expect to hold in the international
system.

#### States engage in status competition -- five reasons.

When do states engage in status competition? The renewed emphasis within
the international relations literature on status, status attri- bution,
and status competition is a welcome trend. It is clear that [states care
about their status]{.underline} and [foreign policy makers perceive that
high status attribution is salient for them]{.underline}, for both
domestic political and foreign policy reasons. However, we raisefive
warn- ings about how scholars address status seeking and status
competition. **[First]{.underline}**, we suggest [that it is dangerous
to conflate competition and conflict between states as driven
exclusively or primarily by status considerations]{.underline}. [Policy
makers'desires to maintain or enhance their status may be a'fundamental
state motivation']{.underline}(Duque, 2018, p. 1) [but status concerns
likely constitute a variable condition rather than a constant state of
affairs for most states]{.underline}. If so, then we need to specify
conditions under which **[policy makers are motivated to engage in
international politics as a function of their need for greater status,
or from a fear of being unable to maintain the status they
have]{.underline}**. 8 It is a dis- torting academic exercise to assume
that almost all foreign policy activity is motivated by status
considerations, any more than solely by security concerns or domestic
political advantages. [Sometimes the desire to acquire a naval carrier
is based on perceived security needs rather than the need to acquire
a'status toy.']{.underline} **[Second]{.underline}**, we do not believe
that [the pursuit of greater status]{.underline}, [or the need to
maintain extant status]{.underline}, [should automatically equate to
status competition and conflict between states]{.underline}. In fact,
the conditions and constraints involved for states potentially engaging
in status-seeking policies are complex (as suggested in Figure 9), and
do not automatically lead to extensive competition or conflict. As we
had noted earlier, status-seeking strategies may depend in substantial
part on where states are positioned (e.g. Roren & Beaumont, 2018), and
the extent of their dissatisfaction with their positioning. [States on a
strong upward status trajectory]{.underline} (e.g. China)
[are]{.underline} likely to behave differently, and [likely to take
fewer risks than states in danger of losing their status]{.underline},
as their status is declining in the group hierarchy, or if they may be
in danger altogether of falling out of the status club (Russia).
Additionally, [it is unlikely that different types of status-seeking
strategies produce similar levels of inter-state competition or
conflict]{.underline}. Larson's work (Larson,2017; Larson &
Shevchenko,2003, 2010) applying SIT theory to status seeking suggests
that there are three broad, non-mutually exclusive strategies available
to states seeking higher status or for trying to keep the status they
have. These include social mobility (emulating the values of
higher-status states), social competition (striving to equal or surpass
the domi- nant group), and social creativity (revaluing a negative
characteristic as positive, or, iden- tifying a new dimension on which
the state may demonstrate superiority). While all three strategies can
generate substantial conflict between states, social mobility and social
crea- tivity generate fewer conflicts than social competition, and may
generate substantial cooperation (Duque,2018, p. 18). Which of these
strategies will be pursued by states seeking additional status, and the
conditions under which status seeking generates sub- stantial
inter-state conflict and competition requires substantial additional
theoretical and empirical work. **[Third]{.underline}**, [too much of
the extant scholarship ignores the premise that the global contexts in
which states operate are also likely to impact on the status seeking
options]{.underline}. For example, Wohlforth (2009) argues that [the
more stratified the distribution of capabilities in international
politics, the less the ambiguity about positioning, and the ability of
states to do something about their positioning]{.underline}. [The more
unambiguous and highly stra- tified the international system, the less
likely that states will engage in status competition]{.underline} as
especially membership in the most prestigious of status clubs is
exceedingly difficult to attain for states not already part of the
grouping. Wohlforth's warning is important: it suggests that [the
structure of the international system can significantly constrain
additional status seeking by states, even when policy makers prefer to
change their status positioning in international politics]{.underline}.
9 We have yet to assess systematically how these considerations impact
on the extent to which foreign policy makers will prioritize their
status concerns, and engage in further status seeking.
**[Fourth]{.underline}**, [there is substantial, unresolved controversy
in the status literature regarding the relevant reference point for
status seekers. Status is inherently both a relational and a per-
ceptual concept]{.underline}. [When policy makers assess their own
status, whether in terms of group membership or a hierarchical ordering,
what is the relevant reference group?]{.underline} The [literature has
offered]{.underline} at least [three competing answers]{.underline} to
this question. [One is that status is assessed in terms of 'aspiration':
unless one has already achieved positioning at the apex of a hier-
archy, states always seek entrance to status groups with higher
standing]{.underline}, and in terms of hierarchical ordering, are
typically seeking a higher position than what they perceive to have been
attributed to them. 10 A [second approach suggests that, at least for
major and regional powers, it is the global attribution of status by the
global community of states that matters]{.underline} (Bezerra, Cramer,
Hauser, Miller, & Volgy,2015; Miller et al.,2015). [A third perspective
suggests that it is pri- marily the 'relevant reference group' that
matters to policy makers, and there are two can- didates]{.underline}:
[status attribution in the hierarchy]{.underline} by other club members
(e.g. other members of the major power club), or, attribution by those
other states that [are deemed most relevant to the state in
question]{.underline} (Renshon,2017). Which states are relevant
reference points? For most states [status attribution may be
regional]{.underline}: their relative status compared to those states
with which they most often interact, and typically those would be other
states in the region. 11 [For rising powers]{.underline}, the [relevant
states]{.underline} [could]{.underline} [be]{.underline} both the [club
members]{.underline} where they are seeking entrance, [and]{.underline},
depending on whether or not such status seeking constitutes a zero-sum
game, [other rising powers seeking membership in the same
club]{.underline}. The appropriate reference group matters to policy
makers, and it should matter as well for our central question of the
extent to which status seeking by'rising'powers equals status
competition amongst them. Clearly, [such status seeking does not have to
result is status competition]{.underline}. Both [India and Brazil could
join the major power club without directly competing against each other
for additional status]{.underline}, unless the status marker is one of
gaining a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. China and Russia
can both increase their ranking in the major power hierarchy and need
not define such outcomes as constituting a zero-sum process. Of course,
[the extent to which such status seeking leads to substantial
competition and conflict also depends on the type of status seeking
strategy the two states would adopt]{.underline}. **[Status competition
and conflict is much more likely for states that seek to become regional
powers in the same region]{.underline}**. Two or more states seeking to
be recognized as the dominant power in a geopolitical space makes for
both competition and conflict; [Turkish and Iranian regional status
aspirations]{.underline} in the Middle East [are unlikely to be played
out in any manner short of a zero-sum context]{.underline}.
**[Fifth]{.underline}**, we caution that [status seeking strategies will
differ depending on the status tra- jectories and capability
trajectories of status aspiring states]{.underline}. [For instance, the
Russian Fed- eration]{.underline}---a state that lost its status in the
superpower club and for a while had difficulty maintaining its
membership in the major power club during the 1990s---has engaged in a
series of status seeking strategies (Larson & Shevchenko,2003; 2010;
Lewis,2018) that are dramatically different from that of China, a rising
power that entered the major power club after the Cold War's end and
continues developing rapidly its economic and military capabilities. It
is understandable that as the Soviet Union disintegrated, the resulting
Russian Fed- eration lost its predecessor's status as a superpower. What
is more interesting is that it [somehow maintained its status as a major
power, especially during the 1990s when its economy was in shambles, its
military beaten internally by a weak Chechen rebellion, and its
political system in disarray]{.underline}. 12 Such a halo effect for a
declining power is likely to cause substantial worry for its policy
makers as its status increasingly depends on its his- torical
positioning (and the path dependency associated with status attribution,
a point also underscored by Duque (2018)) while its capabilities to
sustain global activity and influence are in decline. Again, a
[comparison between the Russian Federation and China]{.underline} (which
emerged into the major power club around 1990 and with capabilities in
an upward trajectory) **[is a useful illustration regarding divergent
paths and difficulties associated with declining versus upward
trajectories in capabilities, status, and status
strategies]{.underline}**. The differences in relative capability
trajectories for these two states are obvious, as indicated inFigures
10and 11.In 1989, the Chinese economy was a bit smaller than that of the
Soviet Union; today it is roughly more thanfive times larger than that
of the Russian Federation (Figure 10). At the end of the Cold War
Chinese military spending was roughly ten percent of the Soviet Union;
by 2016, China's military spending was more than three times that of the
Russian Federation (Figure 11). On relative capabilities alone, and as
well on the trajectory of their capabilities, these two states have
dramatically different capacities to influence the course of
international affairs. To the extent that such capability trajectories
constrain status seeking strategies, these two states may not be
comparable; to the extent that the growth of capabilities may impact on
satisfaction with the status quo, they also signal substantial
differences in risk-taking for maintaining or increasing their status in
international affairs. The ebb andflow of recent current events
underscore the substantial differences between Russian risk-taking
versus Chinese caution. The capture of Crimea and the con- tinued
underwriting of tensions in eastern Ukraine, the strong military and
political invol- vement with the Assad regime in Syria, and the
aggressive interference in the American elections of 2016 are but a few
signs of such Russian risk-taking. Russian commitment to modernizing its
extensive nuclear forces even during times of economic difficulties, is
another. Meanwhile, [China has exhibited relatively risk-averse policies
outside of its immediate backyard]{.underline} (in the East and South
China seas), [ranging from a modest response to the U.S. bombing of its
Serbian embassy]{.underline} 13 in 1999 [through its quiet diplomacy and
negotiations with the U.S. in response to President Trump's blustering
denunciations and tariffthreats over China's trade
policies]{.underline}. **[It is difficult to decipher whether or not
this comparison is an anomaly or one that is typical of the differences
between declining versus rising powers, without a systematic and
comparative analysis that moves beyond these two cases]{.underline}**.
Nor can we tell without a more systematic and comparative analysis
across a broader variety of cases whether or not these differences in
strategies (high risk-taking and aggressive for the Russian Federation
and low-risk, conservative on the part of China) is a function of
differences in trajectories or their relative dissatisfaction with the
global status quo. Yet these two cases are strongly suggestive of
dramatically different status-seeking strategies by states with
different capa- bility trajectories and different issues related to
their relative status in the major power club's hierarchy. In this
sense, their approaches to status seeking may not be comparable. They
are also suggestive of another issue: the reference point for status
aspiration may be historical rather than contemporary, and not
necessarily one of competition and conflict between'rising'powers. [The
Russian status reference appears to be more in the context of its status
as attributed by Western states and powers]{.underline} (e.g.
Neumann,2016), [and not in comparison to China's rising
status]{.underline}. The Chinese reference may be in the context of its
historical focus on global South leadership, and thus may be at least as
con- cerned with its status among the entire community of states as much
as with those that are members of the major power club. In fact, there
is no reason to assume that status seeking among rising powers must be a
zero-sum game of competition and conflict. The creation of institutions
such as the BRICS and the G-20 illustrate that substantial cooperation
between rising powers can also achieve higher status. **[Whether rising
powers actually engage in status competition with each other may very
well depend on the nature of their trajectories, their membership in
major or regional power status clubs, and the extent of their
dissatisfaction with the pro- gress they are making in either seeking
club membership or their placement within the hierarchy once membership
is granted]{.underline}**. 14 [We need to assess systematically the
range of factors, both environmental and endogenous to rising powers
that would trigger or mini- mize status competition between
them]{.underline}; such work is not presently available in our knowl-
edge base regarding how'rising'powers seek additional status in world
politics. [The focus of this special issue is to add to that knowledge
base.]{.underline}

This link between individual and group status does not hold solely for
small groups but is also relevant for large groups. In modern settings,
individuals have a constant high stake in how their nation performs by
comparison to other nations, because the higher the nation's standing,
the stronger their pride as members of the nation and of its political
manifestation, the state. To quote Greenfeld: 'nationality elevated
every member of the community which it made sovereign. It guaranteed
status. National identity is, fundamentally, a matter of dignity. It
gives people reasons to be proud.'30 That is to say that
[decision-makers have to care about their state's standing for two
mutually reinforcing reasons. First, decision-makers identify with their
state because they are not only members of the nation-state themselves,
but also its chief representatives on the world stage]{.underline}.31
[Second, they would be compelled to cater to]{.underline} the sentiments
of their [domestic publics]{.underline} or/and of powerful domestic
groups [such as the military that regard status as a matter of national
prid]{.underline}e[. To this extent, maintaining]{.underline} their own
personal [status]{.underline} in their respective domestic societies [is
tied to how high or low is the status of the state
internationally]{.underline}. Moreover, even if leaders bow to domestic
pressure for their own interest, the demand for status conscientious
policies derives from a high psychological investment of citizens in the
international standing of their state.32 [Status]{.underline} may also
be significant because of two additional instrumental reasons: it [adds
to the coercive capacity of the state, and implicitly, to its security;
and it increases the state's soft power, and therefore bolsters its
legitimacy,]{.underline} which, in turn reduces its costs of exercising
leadership. However, these forms of instrumentality are more complex
than usually assumed. The straightforward connection between a state's
policy and its perception by other states has been contested [-- states
do not acquire a reputation for strength by firmness, or for weakness by
giving in to their opponents, **and consequently reputation is not
proven as producing material advantages**.]{.underline}33 Thus, [the
repeated concern of decision-makers for status in the absence of
verifiable material payoffs is easier to understand if status is
conceptualised as sought foremost for the **psychological satisfaction
it provides**]{.underline}, rather than for concrete benefits alone. It
is even conceivable that decision-makers who claim to act so as to
manipulate the opponent's perceptions of their strength are motivated by
deeper concerns for competitiveness in terms of status and for the
related need to maintain domestic morale.34 **[Furthermore, status may
add to the soft power of a state, but the pursuit of status may also
undermine soft power]{.underline}**.35 For instance, it could be argued
that the US intervened against Iraq in 2003 as a demonstration of
strength in the aftermath of 9/11. The military success of the Iraq war
enhanced (before the insurrection) the prestige of the US and
contributed to its status. But at the same time, it affected negatively
the soft power of the US in global polls.36 Hence, while this article
does not rule out that status may constitute a useful instrument, it
regards status primarily as an end in itself

#### ***[Status Anxiety]{.underline}* theory suggests larger differences in *[capabilities]{.underline}* and *[reputation]{.underline}* lead to more stability**

[A final proviso must be made]{.underline} concerning statements by
French and British decision-makers [that reflect concern for the
upsetting of the balance of power by the rising state]{.underline}, and
as such may expose a long-term security risk, but may [also]{.underline}
convey concern [for the loss of dominant status]{.underline}. Both
interpretations may not be mutually exclusive, since decision-makers
'may try to balance power while at the same time struggling to alter
their status in the global hierarchy'.68 However, even as the two
interpretations remain difficult to tell apart, [the status anxiety
model may be to some extent more warranted]{.underline}. [The balance of
power model assumes that the most dangerous distribution of power is an
asymmetrical one]{.underline}, [in which a state possesses significantly
more capabilities]{.underline} (and presumably status) [relative its
competitors]{.underline}. Therefore, as long as the distribution of
power between states is even, no security threat is present. [But for
hegemonic theories]{.underline}, [such as status anxiety]{.underline},
the opposite is the case: **[the steeper the disparity of capabilities
and prestige, the more stable will the international hierarchy
be]{.underline}**. [Hence, the flatter the hierarchy becomes due to the
emerging symmetry in status between the declining dominant state and its
main contender]{.underline}, the higher the danger of rivalry.69 The
point is that, in both cases examined, the dominant state and the
next-in-line power were almost level in terms of status and
capabilities, which, if balance of power logic applied, should have
resulted in mutual forbearance. To this extent, the French and British
invocations of the balance of power may represent efforts to legitimise
the dominant power's resistance to the rising power.

#### Status seeking is intrinsic to state identity -- international power is rooted in social perception

[Humans are hardwired to care about their status]{.underline} as
individuals and [about the status of groups with which they
identify]{.underline}.7 Numerous scholars have demonstrated the
significant degree to which status concerns drive international
behavior.8 [International status is based on the collective beliefs of
others about a state's rank on admirable characteristics]{.underline}
[such as military capability, wealth, demographic position, or
diplomatic influence]{.underline}.9 Because objective rankings of status
dimensions are often impossible, **[a state's rank is rooted in social
perception]{.underline}**.10 [International status seeking is therefore
the process of attempting to shape other states']{.underline}
[perceptions]{.underline} [about one's rightful position]{.underline}
[in the international hierarchy]{.underline}.11 Status seeking may be an
innate human trait, but actors do not seek status at all times. [States
are particularly inclined to engage in status competition]{.underline}
[**when their status has been called into question** by an instance of
disrespect]{.underline} [or by a humiliating international
event]{.underline}. To show "respect" is to behave in a manner
consistent with another state's status; to show disrespect is to deny
another state the degree of esteem or consideration it feels entitled
to, thereby implicitly refusing to recognize the state's desired
status.12 [Disrespect]{.underline} therefore [depends upon a state's
expectation of how much consideration and deference it believes others
should show it,]{.underline} **[an expectation that is derived from the
state's identity]{.underline}**.13 Disrespect may assume an evaluative
form in which others clearly acknowledge but disregard a state's
interests or a nonevaluative form in which others ignore the state's
interests, rights, and concerns altogether.[14 An act of disrespect may
occur]{.underline} [within the public sphere for all to see or may occur
privately between two states. A state is humiliated when it believes
that its position has been lowered]{.underline} in the eyes of others
**[and that this lowered estimation will result in a future decline in
respect and deference]{.underline}**.15 [Humiliation]{.underline} may be
an intended act.16It [may]{.underline} also, however, [be
self-inflicted]{.underline} [when a state fails to live up to the
expectations of the international community. Defeat in conflict to a
"weaker" state,]{.underline} for instance, [or the involuntary loss of
territory]{.underline} to a lower-status state [will likely cause the
international community to question the state's position]{.underline}
within the international status hierarchy. Humiliating events occur on
the world stage and thereby threaten to generate common knowledge within
the international community of the state's decline.17 [Humiliated or
disrespected state]{.underline}s that have the capabilities to do so
**[will likely engage in competitive acts with the intention of
signaling the status]{.underline}** **[they expect to hold in the
international system]{.underline}**.18 Such [competitive acts may occur
within a bilateral environment as a disrespected state attempts to
signal to a particular rival]{.underline} [that it expects to be treated
with a greater degree of deference]{.underline}. [They may also occur
within]{.underline} more [multilateral environments as states
that]{.underline} have been humiliated or disrespected on the world
stage [attempt to shape the perceptions of the international
community]{.underline} of their right to heightened status.19
Competitive [status-seeking acts]{.underline} [may include efforts to
gain membership into elite clubs]{.underline} [through the acquisition
of symbols of great power]{.underline} or regional status.20 [They may
also include direct military confrontation]{.underline} or competition
over spheres of influence, the size of weapons arsenals, or the extent
of territorial holdings. Finally[, states may attempt to
demonstrate]{.underline} their [existing infl]{.underline}uence [over
international outcomes]{.underline} [in an effort to minimize the
appearance of influence]{.underline} by the superior state.21
Status-challenged states are likely to adopt competitive status-seeking
strategies aimed at asserting their "rightful position" in the
international system for two primary reasons.22 First, both [humiliation
and disrespect]{.underline} **[engender strong emotional
responses]{.underline}** such as anger [that increase the likelihood
that a state will behave in an aggressive manner]{.underline} toward
others.23 Such emotional reactions to humiliation will lead states to
first and foremost desire revenge upon the state that directly or
indirectly threatened their status.24 Second, [leaders of
disrespected]{.underline} and humiliated [states will desire to protect
the state's self-image]{.underline} [for fear that if they do not, **the
state will face demotion within the international status
hierarchy**]{.underline}.25 This demotion has both instrumental
consequences, in that [a decline in status is a decline in influence,
but also emotional consequences as well in that states,]{.underline}
like individuals, [seek to have a voice and to be respected by those in
their community]{.underline}. Such [states]{.underline} therefore [seek
clear and effective ways to establish common knowledge]{.underline}
within the international community of their state's distinctive
capabilities, their intention for the state to be perceived as high
status, and their expectation that others within the international
community will treat it accordingly.26

Status and status-seeking behaviour in IR For a growing number of
scholars coming from different research traditions, **[status matters in
international politics]{.underline}** (Dafoe, Renshon, & Huth, 2014;
Paul, Larson, & Wohlforth, 2014b). [The increasing number of
studies]{.underline} [that dealt with status by using different theories
and methodologies is a clear result of the attributed importance to this
research theme in IR]{.underline}. Within the literature, [status
is]{.underline}, however, [overwhelmingly ascribed to the material
sources]{.underline} such as military and economic capabilities such as
industrial and technological wealth and power, military spending and
military might (Larson & Shevchenko, 2003; Larson & Shevchenko, 2010;
Paul, Larson, & Wohlforth, 2014; Wohlforth, 2009) [as well as material
related actions]{.underline} such as military assertiveness, state of
diplomatic relations, membership in major international organizations,
numbers of head-of-state visits or hosting the Olympics (Larson &
Shevchenko, 2003; Larson & Shevchenko, 2010; Pu, 2017), the possession
of superior technological capabilities (Larson and Shevchenko 2003,
2010) or nuclear weapons (O'Neill, 2001). Aside these material
attributions, in a very restricted number of studies status has also
been attached to fundamental values, political system or ideology,
culture or civilization or moral superiority (Carvalho & Neumann, 2014;
Luard, 1976; Neumann, 2014). [Despite the fact that a large body of
literature focuses on largely material foundation of
status]{.underline}, [it has been widely accepted that material strength
alone cannot bring higher status to states.]{.underline} [Status can
only be possible through achieving a certain level of international
legitimacy]{.underline} (Stephen, 2014). In fact, status is a social
phenomenon and is generally defined as 'a recognized position (a
hierarchy) in a social hierarchy, implying relations of dominance and
deference'. From that vantage point, in the existing literature [there
is an intrinsic relationship between status and the concepts like
identity, prestige, esteem and honour]{.underline} (Larson & Shevchenko,
2014). The literature also emphasizes that [social status refers to a
position in a social system with its distinctive array of designated
rights and obligations]{.underline}. [As such, status as a social
relation actually depends on recognition and acceptance]{.underline}.
This brings us to the question of status inconsistency. Status
inconsistency in international relations suggests that differences on
several status dimensions have certain consequences that can be observed
in states' foreign policy choices. A state may have high material
capabilities in terms of economic and military assets. However, in some
cases, it may not translate this achieved status into an ascribed status
due to the lack of status recognition. [A country with relatively little
material capacity can acquire higher ascribed status mainly due to the
positional closeness to the major powers]{.underline}. This type of
circumstances is referred as [status inconsistency]{.underline} [in
international relations]{.underline} which [may]{.underline} also [lead
to deviant behaviours, even conflict and violence]{.underline}. Volgy,
Corbetta, Grant, and Baird (2011) suggested that [status inconsistency
can be observed in both underachieving or overachieving
terms]{.underline}. Overachievers are the ones who have gained
over-recognition yet lacking critical material means associated with
that status while underachievers are not granted recognition even though
they have material capacity and will for that status (Volgy & Mayhall,
1995). Another point in the existing literature on status focuses on the
way states compare their status in a given society. In this sense,
[status communities are important theoretical innovation to understand
the way countries make status comparison]{.underline}. [It is often
acknowledged that status is relative and status inconsistency generally
occurs within specific referent status communities of peer
competitors]{.underline}. A significant portion of this literature draws
heavily from social comparison theory (SCT) which observes that
individuals judge their worth, and accordingly derive self-esteem,
through comparisons with others (Paul, Larson, & Wohlforth, 2014a, p.
17). According to this transposed argument, **[states become status
seekers because]{.underline}**, like individuals and groups, **[they
have an innate desire for favourable social status comparisons relative
to their peers]{.underline}** (Wohlforth, 2009, p. 35). Where social
comparisons help actors ask 'How do I rank relative to my peers?'
temporal comparisons help actors evaluate how they have improved or
declined over time (Clunan, 2009, p. 12). Who is rising, at which degree
and for which status? In the last decade, there has been tremendous
changes in rising powers' global governance policies as a result of huge
power transitions from the Global North to the Global South and the rise
of salience of informal groupings or status clubs in the international
system. This shift has made rising powers both more cooperative and
competitive in many issue areas of global governance from global
financial governance to the funding of the UN and its special agencies,
from development cooperation to climate change. [The uncertainties
around which power is rising]{.underline}, which is not also [adds
additional confusion to the assessment of these states' status seeking
policies]{.underline}. In their article collected under this cluster on
status competition and rising powers, Thomas J. Volgy and Kelly Marie
Gordell touch upon the uncertainties around the way the so-called rising
powers are rising, have risen or declining and try to assess the linkage
between the typology of rising power and their differing status-seeking
strategies emanating from the variations observed in their rise.
[Despite extensive scholarly attention to the concepts of rising power
and status/status-seeking]{.underline}, [contestation regarding the
classification of state powers]{.underline} (which are rising, which are
declining, and what status clubs are considered to be the targets of
rising powers), the conditions under which status concerns play a role
for the rising powers, and the consequences that can exist when it comes
to global and regional forms of governance [continues to
remain]{.underline}. As suggested by Volgy and Gordell, lack of
consensus regarding even categorization of 'rising' versus 'risen', or,
declining powers for instance becomes problematic in attempts to better
understand how status is regarded by states, and the potential for it to
influence state actions, and the variation in risks that states are
willing to take when they are rising, have risen, or are in decline.
Indeed, countries thought of as 'rising powers' ultimately vary since
the term rising can be understood in a variety of ways. For instance,
Volgy and Gordell argue that states such as Brazil, China, India,
Russia, and South Africa stand apart from the other states like Turkey.
This is in terms of opportunity, willingness, and overall competence to
operate as major or regional powers for example, among the broader
community of states. These states and their actions and interactions
have consequences for the extent of global and regional governance
within the international political system. As underlined by Volgy and
Gordell [there exists a linkage between the level of rise of the
so-called rising powers and their status competition
policies]{.underline}. For the authors, [the majority of states within
this special issue have effectively risen, with some potentially still
rising]{.underline} (from one grouping to another), while two countries,
Iran and Turkey, are considered at best rising, but with uncertain
trajectories. [Whether the rising powers may or may not create influence
in the international system determines the extent to which these states
need to engage in status competition]{.underline}. In short, [not all
rising powers can upgrade their status by the adoption of status
competition strategies since their 'rise' and their rising actorness
depend on the positive impact they may create vis-à-vis the major powers
and other actors of the current international system]{.underline}. Some
status-seeking strategies are much more appropriate for a group of
rising powers, while others are not.

[This]{.underline} second [study]{.underline} again [found evidence for
a **competitive orientation towards status**]{.underline}. [Participants
were willing to]{.underline} "give up" a significant amount of absolute
status -- that is, to be less respected and to [receive less deference
on an absolute level -- if it meant receiving more respect and deference
**than others** received.]{.underline} In direct comparisons of the
strength of the two orientations, [it was found that participants had at
least as strong a competitive orientation as they had an individualist
orientation, if not stronger]{.underline} (depending on the specific
question asked). Together, these [two studies suggest]{.underline} that
the human [**desire for status is very competitive** in
nature]{.underline}: participants sought to have higher status than
others, above and beyond simply having high status. That is,
[participants wanted to be accorded a higher level of respect than
others]{.underline}, above and beyond simply wanting to be respected.
These findings are important for a number of reasons. First, as
mentioned in the Introduction, [these findings might help explain the
**pervasiveness of status hierarchies.**]{.underline}
[Individuals]{.underline} might generate and [**perpetuate status
inequality** by continually striving to receive more
respect]{.underline} and deference [than others, rather than being
satisfied with an egalitarian social structure]{.underline} in which
everyone is respected and where everyone's voice is heard equally.
Second, the current [results might shed light on well-established
phenomena in the psychological literature, such as why]{.underline}
[people]{.underline} feel competitive with friends (Tesser, 1988), why
they [are happier when others around them are worse off]{.underline}
economically (e.g., Boyce, Brown, & Moore, 2010), and why they desire to
have a better education or bigger house than others (e.g., Solnick &
Hemenway, 1998). [It is possible that the fundamental human desire for
status, with its competitive nature, might help drive these kinds of
behaviors.]{.underline}

[The more status competition will extend to additional
dimensions]{.underline}, **[the more status anxiety will
intensify]{.underline}**, [and the more the chances of a continuing
rivalry will increase.]{.underline} Indeed, [a dominant power falling
behind in a single dimension is more likely to seek to regain its
position]{.underline} by harnessing additional resources and cutting
costs [rather than by resorting to threats or actual
violence.]{.underline} But the more the upcoming state will seem on the
verge of replicating its initial success, the more it will threaten the
status of the dominant state. Typically, [in]{.underline} modern
[I]{.underline}nternational [R]{.underline}elations, [rivalry will
undergo a sequential progression from benign trade and financial
competition, triggered by the rising state's economic growth, to more
serious arms races,]{.underline} **[caused by the rising actor's efforts
to match]{.underline}** (and protect) **[its economic accomplishments in
the military field]{.underline}**, to open hostility, caused by the
rising power's eventual assertive policy toward third parties.65 The
reasons for this exact sequence may have to do with the change brought
by the industrial revolution in military affairs. If in preindustrial
times, a polity could convert military force into economic bounty and
vice versa more easily, as well as capitalise on victory in war through
conquest, in present days an efficient military requires preliminary
strong economic foundations; and, furthermore, the conquest of territory
brings steadily diminishing economic returns. [As a result, a growing
state has to develop first economically, then militarily, and only then
it is able to contemplate an assertive foreign policy]{.underline}. The
problem is that as it is undergoing this sequence, the rising power is
likely to elicit increasing status anxiety on the part of the dominant
state.66 [The dominant state will]{.underline} not fear a direct attack
on its territory, but will [be concerned that, by allowing a free hand
to the rising power, it will de facto abdicate its superior
rank]{.underline}. [Therefore, a situation of ambiguity over the proper
distribution of status emerges between the declining dominant state and
its nearest challenger, **which is likely to generate
rivalry.**]{.underline}

#### **Positions of power are zero-sum -- challenges to those positions is the fundamental cause of rivalry**

power rivalry*, 152-153, // NC)

[Rivalries between great powers over dominance have captured scholarly
attention since the days of Thucydides. However, the bulk of studies
have concentrated on shifts in capabilities, while **neglecting the
motives that produce such positional rivalries.** The status
anxiety]{.underline} hypothesis is an effort to **[address this
omission]{.underline}**, [by tracing their occurrence and
continuation]{.underline}, sometimes for decades, to the clashing status
requirements of the dominant power and those of the next-in-line state.
In a nutshell, [status anxiety argues that the refusal of the dominant
power to allow the succession of the challenger will be a **fundamental
cause of rivalry,**]{.underline} [worsening as the rising power
threatens to overtake the current leader in additional
dimensions]{.underline}. The purpose of this article was to formulate
this hypothesis as well as subject it to preliminary testing. **[The
findings suggest that status anxiety represented a significant
influence]{.underline}**, though not necessarily excluding additional
balance of power considerations, [in the foreign policy decision-making
of declining dominant powers]{.underline}: France in the mid-eighteenth
century and Britain at the turn of the twentieth century. [Status
anxiety thus helps account for the hostility France manifested towards
Britain]{.underline}, [and Britain towards German demands for superior
status]{.underline}, a reaction which is more problematic to account for
by theories stressing solely physical security and material gains. A
further contribution of this endeavour is that it suggests the existence
of a dominant power club, distinct from the club of major or great
powers, and, as such, following a different set of rules.138 [The
existing status literature has concentrated exclusively on]{.underline}
the latter club, [arguing]{.underline} persuasively that [there is no
impediment]{.underline} for granting either admission to new members or
opportunities [for further advancement to current ones]{.underline}.139
[Hence, status competition in the great power club is seen as nonzero
sum. But the dominant power club has a membership of one]{.underline},
which makes it unfeasible for the dominant power to satisfy the demands
of dominant power aspirants without voluntarily surrendering its
supremacy. Accordingly, [status competition over the **dominant position
is more likely to be zero-sum** and lead to rivalry.]{.underline} The
findings of this article are at this point only plausible, yet they
highlight the need for further research covering the entire universe of
dominant powers in order to determine both if intense status anxiety
always prompts conflict and if reduced status anxiety or its absence
lead to stability. Consequently, additional studies of the role of
status for dominant powers foreign policy should be conducted, extending
beyond the current en vogue concentration on the foreign policy of
rising powers alone[. Indeed, dominant powers' status anxiety may be
increasingly policy-relevant, if unipolarity were to erode due to a
steady shrinking of distance between the US and China]{.underline}.

A significant portion of the [IR literature draws heavily from
behavioral economics and social psychology]{.underline}, and their
respective observations that individuals judge their worth, and
accordingly derive self-esteem, through comparisons with others (Larson
et al., 2014: 17). [According to]{.underline} Leon Festinger's (1954:
118) [social comparison theory logic, in the absence of "objective
evidence," individuals will make self-evaluative judgments about their
opinions and abilities by comparing themselves]{.underline} [with the
opinions and abilities of their peers.]{.underline} Experiments in the
SCT tradition have subsequently shown that individuals are highly
sensitive to their relative position. When individuals engage in
downward comparisons --- those made with people worse off --- they
appear to reduce distress and enhance self-esteem, while upward
comparisons --- those made with people better off --- can be
"demoralizing, because one is forced to face one's own inferiority"
(Wood, 1989: 239). In economics, the logic of SCT has informed debate on
the individual utility of absolute versus relative consumption.
[Experiments operating in this tradition have shown that, contrary to
traditional economic models premised on the notion that an individual's
sense of well-being derives from their absolute standard of living, it
is actually an individual's relative living standard]{.underline} that
proves to be a far more important economic determinant (Frank, 1999:
109). As Frank (2005: 137--140) showed across a number of experiments,
individuals increasingly favor scenarios that give them larger homes and
higher salaries relative to their peers than those that give them a
greater absolute value in home size and salary but a lower position in
these assets relative to their peers. Frank (2004: 140) concluded, in
effect, that "positional concerns loom large in human motivation" to
such an extent that individuals appear willing to sacrifice absolute
consumption for relative gains. 802 European Journal of International
Relations 22(4) Likewise, where individuals derive parts of their
identity from membership in various social groups (Tajfel, 1978), they
will also derive significant self-esteem from comparing the achievements
and qualities of their in-group to those of a reference group (Larson
and Shevchenko, 2010: 68). [According to this transposed argument,
states become status seekers because,]{.underline} as with individuals
and groups, **[they have an innate desire for favorable social status
comparisons]{.underline}** relative to their peers (Wohlforth, 2009:
35). Larson and Shevchenko (2010: 68, 70, 86) argue, for example, that
China primarily compares its achievements to Japan, the US, and Russia,
and that unfavorable comparisons with these actors are a main source of
Beijing's status insecurity. Thus, the literature on status in world
politics is often framed in the language of accommodation, and
adjustment (Larson et al., 2014: 4), [which presupposes that **status
insecurities develop from lateral social comparisons and can be resolved
through lateral improvements**.]{.underline}

#### The drive for [status]{.underline} is inevitable but checked by [stable leadership]{.underline} --- threats to power encourages [status-seeking]{.underline} and [imperialism]{.underline}

**Barnhart, 16** - Assistant Professor of Government (Joslyn, \"Status
Competition and Territorial Aggression: Evidence from the Scramble for
Africa\", Security Studies, 7-8-2016, Vol 25, Issue 3, p. 417-419))SK

This article has demonstrated that [humiliated]{.underline} and
disrespected [states are likely to engage in **competitive
status-seeking behavior**]{.underline} and that they are often willing
to do so [in spite of]{.underline} their material and [strategic
interests]{.underline}. The cases above demonstrate that responses to
humiliation and disrespect need not involve demonstrations of one's
military effectiveness relative to that of potential rivals. France, in
a move that undoubtedly changed few minds about its military capability
relative to that of potential European rivals, handily acquired control
of the bankrupt Tunisian government within less than two weeks.
Similarly, [Germany's initial act of imperialism involved little more
than planting a flag at a remote]{.underline}, barren port. Rather,
[both states sought to signal their expectation of holding higher status
by exercising the prerogatives associated with their desired
status]{.underline}. Because it often threatens the status, security,
and interests of other states, [status seeking engendered by humiliation
and disrespect often has a significant impact on international
behavior]{.underline}. [Germany's decision to become an empire, for
instance, generated status concerns for Italy, leading it to embark upon
a colonial policy of its own]{.underline}.146 While in 1882 Minister of
Foreign Affairs Pasquale Mancini privately decried the system of
territorial colonies as "sterile and harmful \... a source of weakness
rather than of strength," in May 1884, he ordered the occupation of
Massawa in current-day Eritrea in January of 1885.147 The timing of this
shift in attitude can be pinpointed almost exactly to Bismarck's
imperial debut. [The Italian statesman came to see German actions as
setting a new precedent that threatened the relegation of Italy to a
lower status]{.underline}.148 [A]{.underline}s one [diplomat
stated]{.underline} at the time, "[Germany had acted; Italy must
act]{.underline}."149 If Italy were to ever acquire its "place in the
sun," it would have to "abandon prudence" and engage in costly African
expansion like the other European powers.150 The [French and German
adoption of forward policies in Africa also presented direct threats to
Britain's unchallenged status as the preeminent seafaring
power]{.underline}. With the French ratification of the Congo treaty and
the possibility of French ownership of much of the west coast of Africa,
the British began to detect a consistent French policy of anti-British
antagonism.151 [British leaders]{.underline} also [increasingly
confronted the antagonistic intentions]{.underline} of the "young and
ambitious" Germany, which was continuing its assault on Britain's "Munro
\[sic\] doctrine" in the west. Over time, [British leaders came to
realize that if Britain were to remain a preeminent power, **they could
not allow themselves to be "cheeked by Bismarck** or anyone
else]{.underline}."152 [Without a "positive and vigorous effort" to
assert British rights as the preeminent power, Britain would be left
behind, suffering the inevitable **decline of an empire**.]{.underline}
As The Times put it in 1891, "[With the colonies massed around us we can
hold our]{.underline} own in the ranks of the world [Power]{.underline}s
\... [without them we must sink to the position of a merely European
kingdom]{.underline} a position [which]{.underline} for England [entails
slow but sure decay]{.underline}."153 British leaders agreed, with
Neville Chamberlain stating that a failure to expand further would
"strike at the root cause of our great position."154 [By the turn of the
century, Britain---the once reluctant imperialist---had acquired
possession of over roughly one-quarter of the entire African
continent]{.underline}.155 The European powers collectively had assumed
control of 95 percent of the entire African continent. While concerns
about status have not generated similar competition for territory over
the last century, [recent territorial claims by **Russia and China**
suggest that the **potential for status-driven conquest
remains**]{.underline}.156 The likelihood that states in the
contemporary system will seek status through territorial expansion
increases in cases in which states' spheres of interest are disrespected
by prominent powers within the international community. [Territorial
expansion]{.underline}, however, [is only one of many ways that states
in the contemporary international system may assert their status
following instances of humiliation]{.underline} or disrespect. [States
may choose to lead multilateral interventions, to conduct weapons tests,
or to form regional economic institutions]{.underline}.157 Regardless of
the exact competitive status-seeking strategy contemporary states engage
in, we should expect the general conditions outlined in this article to
apply. States that have been humiliated or disrespected will be likely
to engage in competitive behaviors in an effort to secure their status.
[As with French and German conquests in Africa in the 1880s, the actions
such states take in the contemporary world are likely to have
far-reaching consequences.]{.underline}

### 2AC/1NC -- Multipolarity Bad

Similarity. As the perceived similarity of target to actor increases, so
do comparison concerns and thus competitiveness. [Similarity refers both
to similarity in terms of ability or performance on the comparison
dimension]{.underline} (Festinger, 1954, p. 120). For instance, two
golfers are similar to the extent that their performance is similar. Yet
similarity can also refer to similarity of personal characteristics or
attributes more generally, beyond the specific comparison dimension.
Experiments in this vein (Goethals & Darley, 1977) showed [that people
tend to compare themselves with others who are most similar to
them]{.underline} along a number of different attributes that are not
necessarily relevant to the specific comparison context (e.g., "dot
estimation ability" that was determined by false feedback; D. T. Miller,
Turnbull, & McFarland, 1988). Thus, two Psychology of Competition 5
academics who are both persons of color, from the same university, from
a similar PhD vintage, and working in the same field are highly similar
in terms of personal characteristics and are more likely prone toward
mutual social comparison. **[The inclination to compare with similar
others--- whether in terms of performance or
characteristics---]{.underline}** **[begets competitive behavior toward
them]{.underline}**. To illustrate, [one experiment found that
competitive performance]{.underline}--- measured by reaction time to a
geometric-shape recognition task---[increased with the degree of
performance similarity with a rival in competitive
situations]{.underline} (Dakin & Arrowood, 1981). To the extent that
hostility is related to competitiveness, "horizontal hostility" research
(White & Langer, 1999; White et al., 2006) has showed that comparison
concerns increase among similar minority groups, who strive to see their
own group as superior to another, similar group. Among similar minority
groups, the one that is further removed from the mainstream harbors
greater hostility to its less extreme minority counterparts. Examples
include vegans' greater hostility attitudes toward vegetarians (White et
al., 2006) or punks' more hostile attitudes toward gothics (White et
al., 2006). [However, comparison concerns brought about by similarity
among groups also generate competitive rivalry]{.underline}. For
example, [an analysis of a data set on N]{.underline}ational
[C]{.underline}ollegiate [A]{.underline}thletic
[A]{.underline}ssociation [basketball teams]{.underline} [found that a
greater similarity among teams]{.underline}---in terms of geographic
proximity, performance histories, and academic quality---**[led to more
intense experiences of rivalry and competitiveness]{.underline}** for
their players (Kilduff et al., 2010).

### 2AC/1NC -- Logic of Emulation

#### Status competition drives states to the logic of emulation -- attempting to acquire status symbols and credibility through military or economic buildup 

**Ward, PhD, 19**

(Steven, PhD from Georgetown University's Department of Government in
2012, MA in Security Studies from Georgetown's Edmund A. Walsh School of
Foreign Service. "Logics of Stratified Identity Management in World
Politics." International Theory, vol. 11, no. 2, 2019, pp. 211--238.,

The other category of [responses to national status
dissatisfaction]{.underline} [involves]{.underline} [promoting or
working collectively toward some sort of change in the state's
position]{.underline} in or orientation toward the international social
hierarchy. These logics are collective: in SIT's terms, [they aim at
achieving some sort of social change for the entire
in-group]{.underline}. [Responses]{.underline} [in this category are
still usefully understood as phenomena that vary at the individual
level.]{.underline} Different individuals, situated differently within
the national community, with different psychological profiles and
different interests, may prefer and promote different approaches to
redressing a national status deficit. Responses remain collective so
long as they are premised on the maintenance of a strong affiliation
with the state as an identity category, and so long as they are meant to
work by changing the state's position in or orientation toward the
international status hierarchy. I draw on existing distinctions familiar
from social psychological work on intergroup status dynamics to identify
three collective logics of stratified identity management: emulation of
in-groups with higher standing; transformation of some element of the
intergroup comparative situation; and rejection of status quo norms,
rules, institutions, and political arrangements. Emulation Emulation
refers to any effort to improve the group's status by acquiring
symbolically significant resources that are consensually valued and
thought necessary for the achievement of higher status. In short, the
[logic of emulation]{.underline} **[involves an effort undertaken by or
on behalf of an in-group to climb an existing status
'ladder]{.underline}**' -- [to acquire admirable characteristics or
competently perform consensually valued practices]{.underline} in order
to convince relevant others to recognize that the group belongs to a
higher status position than it currently occupies (or to defend an
existing -- but insecure -- position). Notably, this conceptualization
says nothing about the substance of moves informed by the logic of
emulation. That is driven by the nature of what Nexon and Neumann
(following Bourdieu) call capital in the particular social field within
which advanced position is sought. 39 The kinds of characteristics and
performances that are consensually valued -- that are thought to be
status enhancing -- vary across different status communities, different
hierarchies, and over time. In some contexts, for example, [symbols of
military and economic power are understood as the most relevant forms of
status-producing capital]{.underline}. Nexon and Neumann suggest that
[this is typically true of status communities that occupy the top of the
international hierarchy]{.underline} -- in other words**[, to establish
a claim to 'great power' status, or 'world power' status, or to compete
for the position of hegemon,]{.underline}** **[a state will need to
acquire symbolically significant resources]{.underline}** [and
competently perform symbolically significant practices]{.underline}
**[that indicate a certain level of advancement in economic and military
fields]{.underline}**. 40 Still, [the specific form that symbolically
significant practices]{.underline} and resources [take]{.underline} is
constructed and [varies over time]{.underline}. In the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, salient symbols of 'world power' status were
battleships and colonies. Thus, elites in Wilhelmine Germany and
Imperial Japan who promoted efforts to gain entry into the 'world power'
club did so by advocating the construction of large navies and the
acquisition of empires. 41 Over the next several decades, the symbolic
significance of empire was reversed, and [battleships were replaced by
aircraft carriers, space programs, and nuclear weapons as geopolitically
significant status symbols]{.underline}. 42 [Other]{.underline} -- less
violent and conflict prone -- [resources]{.underline} and performances
[may also be understood as capital and sought for reasons related to the
competition for status]{.underline}. For example, Rhamey and Early argue
that Olympic medals increase status, which implies that investing in
athletic prowess is a means of competing for position in global or
regional hierarchies. 43 Towns argues that [practices and institutions
related to gender have also been]{.underline} -- in various ways --
[symbolically significant markers of status.]{.underline} [During the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, for instance, political institutions
that excluded women from power signaled civilization and
advancement.]{.underline} More recently, [political institutions that
aim at inclusion have become symbolically valuable]{.underline}, and
Towns suggests that [the incentive to compete for status is a critical
part of the explanation for the spread of these institutions around the
world]{.underline}. 44 Neumann also argues that even the status
community at the top of the global hierarchy -- the 'great powers' --
has had not just a material and geopolitical basis but also an
institutional and cultural component. [Competition for
status]{.underline} within this community [requires not just acquiring
symbolically significant military or economic resources]{.underline}
(like battleships) or competently performing symbolically significant
military or economic practices (like empire building) **[but also
adopting consensually valued political and cultural institutions and
practices (like democracy or free markets).]{.underline}** 45 [The logic
of emulation subsumes a number of important arguments]{.underline}
[about how states seek]{.underline} (or defend) their
[status]{.underline}. For instance, Renshon argues that [status
dissatisfaction leads states to start wars or militarized disputes as a
way of publicly demonstrating military capacity]{.underline}. This works
because [military capacity is a 'valuable attribute or possession' that
drives status attribution]{.underline} in international relations. 46
Thus, to the extent that [improving and demonstrating military
capacity]{.underline} is a strategy for seeking status, it [functions
via the logic of emulation]{.underline}: by **[advancing the
status-seeker's position along a consensually valued dimension of
comparison in the hope of thereby securing recognition from relevant
others.]{.underline}** Similarly, Barnhart argues that [states whose
status is under threat respond by acquiring symbolically significant
resources to strengthen the foundation of their position]{.underline}.
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, within the 'great power'
status community, this involved competitions for colonial territory,
since empire was, at the time, a symbol of great power status. 47 The
logic of emulation subsumes two of Larson and Shevchenko's
status-seeking strategies. [Social competition]{.underline}, according
to Larson and Shevchenko[, refers to an attempt by a lower status state
to catch or pass a higher status state along the dimensions of
comparison that constitute the latter's advantage.]{.underline} Since,
according to Larson and Shevchenko, [international status hierarchies
are typically founded on military and economic power,]{.underline}
social competition entails the acquisition of symbolically significant
military and economic resources. On the other hand, social mobility
refers -- in Larson and Shevchenko's translation -- to status
advancement via the adoption of the practices, norms, and values of
higher status states. 48 Though these strategies involve substantively
different sets of behaviors in Larson and Shevchenko's framework --
[arms racing]{.underline}, for instance, on the one hand;
[democratization]{.underline}, for example, on the other -- the [logic
by which each is supposed to result in higher status is the
same]{.underline}. **[Both work by advancing the state's position along
consensually valued dimensions of comparison]{.underline}** in [order to
convince relevant others to recognize the former's status
claims.]{.underline}

### 2AC/1NC -- ! -- Distancing

#### Weak national status causes individuals to distance themselves from the state by identifying with larger ethnic or smaller subnational groups

2012, MA in Security Studies from Georgetown's Edmund A. Walsh School of

Politics." International Theory, vol. 11, no. 2, 2019, pp. 211--238.,

[Changes in identification can insulate an individual from the negative
social psychological consequences of low, inadequate, or threatened
national status]{.underline} in two broad ways: first, [by weakening the
individual's attachment to the state]{.underline}, [thereby reducing the
degree to which the individual's self-esteem depends on the state's
status]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, second, [by]{.underline} -- to
some extent -- [replacing the national identity category within the
individual's social identity with some other significant in-group that
contributes more positively to the individual's
self-conception.]{.underline} Identification dynamics can function at
different levels of aggregation, with different consequences for
politics and foreign policy. The most obvious way in which
[dissatisfaction with national status may prompt a change in
identification is by weakening ties to the state relative to subnational
identity categori]{.underline}es. [This is the inverse of]{.underline}
the [nation-building dynam]{.underline}ic that Sambanis, Skaperdas, and
Wohlforth link to state status gains: they argue that [victory in war
increases national status]{.underline}, [which incentivizes individuals
to identify more strongly with the state than with subnational identity
categories]{.underline}. Reversing this logic implies that [reductions
in the state's status produce incentives for **individuals to identify
more weakly with the state and more strongly with subnational
groups.**]{.underline} Examples of this dynamic are easy to identify.
[The loss of Spain's last American possessions after the 'Disaster' of
1898]{.underline} [was felt as a devastating reduction in Spanish status
in some quarters]{.underline}. It constituted for many 'a crisis of both
identity and legitimacy: identity because their own self-esteem was
bound up with that of the nation; legitimacy because those to whom they
had, willingly or unwillingly, entrusted the interests of the nation had
signally failed to defend those interests'. 23 One consequence was that
[some subnational identity groups were strengthene]{.underline}d. For
instance, [the Disaster 'reinforced the feeling among many Catalans that
they had a separate national identity]{.underline} [and a different
historical destiny and that these were incompatible with those of
Castile']{.underline}. 24 The loss of status that accompanied [the
erosion of the British Empire after World War]{.underline}
[II]{.underline} [had a similar effect on the strength and coherence of
the 'British' national identity]{.underline}. David McCrone notes that
'the loss of empire eroded \[the British\] identity at home and abroad',
with a variety of consequences. 25 For one thing, this likely
contributed to the increased salience of sub-British and especially
racial identity categories: Enoch Powell's 'hostility to immigration
from the Black Commonwealth', for instance, flowed from an '"ethnic"
definition of nationality', and 'rested on his recognition that England
lay at the core, and that in many respects "Britain" had come to an
end'. 26 It is also likely that [the loss of the British Empire
contributed in some manner to the increasing salience of Scottish
identity]{.underline} in the decades after the end of World War II. 27
[Concerns about the implications of lost status on the strength of
national identity]{.underline} and the prospects for national
disintegration [are also central to understanding Charles de Gaulle's
desire]{.underline} [to return France to the ranks of the 'world powers'
during the 1960s.]{.underline} 28 There is even evidence that [recurrent
anxiety about relative national decline]{.underline} has [contributed to
partisan animosity in the United States over the past three
decades]{.underline}. 29 Thus, one novel insight that emerges from this
framework is that anxiety about or dissatisfaction with national status
may trigger or exacerbate processes that reduce the strength of national
identity categories and hence unravel or disintegrate political
coherence inside the state. [Identification dynamics can also operate at
trans- or supra-national levels]{.underline}, in which case they may
have very different consequences. It is possible, for instance, that an
[individual could compensate for inadequate or unsatisfying national
status]{.underline} **[by identifying more strongly with an identity
category constituted at a higher level of aggregation than the
state]{.underline}**. Social psychologists refer to this sort of process
as '[recategorization']{.underline}. A classic example comes from
post--Cold War Germany. [East Germans dealt with negative social
comparisons vis-à-vis higher status West Germans]{.underline} [by
tending to identify more strongly simply as 'Germans'.]{.underline} 30
The [Anglo-American power transition]{.underline} during the late 19th
and early 20th centuries [provides another example of
recategorization]{.underline} at work. [Although the rise of the United
States as a continental hegemon presented a serious threat to
British]{.underline} [status]{.underline}, it [did not generate intense
Anglo-American rivalry.]{.underline} 31 Part of the reason was that some
[British elites dealt]{.underline} with this development by
**[identifying more broadly with the Anglo-Saxon ethno-linguistic
family]{.underline}** and celebrating its apparently glorious future. 32
[Cecil Spring-Rice]{.underline}, for instance, [was a long-time British
diplomat and became ambassador to the United States during World War
I]{.underline}. [He was resigned to the inevitability of British decline
**but took comfort in the fact that the United States was 'the real
fortress of our race'**]{.underline}. 33 According to Anderson, 'the
contemplation of America's growing strength gave \[Spring-Rice\] much
satisfaction'. 34 Spring-Rice was not alone: other British leaders made
similar references to 'race patriotism', as did some American leaders.
35 This likely had real consequences for Anglo-American relations:
Anderson suggests that 'the most powerful incentive among the British
populace toward support of American imperialism was the assumption of
Anglo-American racial affinity'. 36 The upshot was that the expansion of
American power and influence -- in important ways a source of
consternation for British leaders and elites concerned about their place
in the world -- became a source of pride. 37 Both versions of this logic
involve [shifts in individual identification as responses to national
status dissatisfaction]{.underline}. Both have firm foundations in
insights from the same social psychological frameworks that have
informed existing analyses of status in IR. They also have potentially
significant implications for both domestic politics and foreign policy.
Yet i[dentification dynamics linked to changes in or anxiety about
national status remain largely ignored]{.underline} or at least
unstudied by analysts interested in understanding the role of status in
international politics. 38

[We do not believe that our concerns about rising, status maintaining,
and status declin- ing powers is a trivial one]{.underline}. In fact,
[the strategies needed, and the risks that states are willing to take
for status purposes very much revolve around the'status of their
status']{.underline}. The risk- taking actions of the Russian Federation
are dramatically different from that of China. These differences are
not, we claim, simply historical or cultural in nature (e.g. Freedman,
2016; Kotkin,2016) but have to do as much with their respective current
trajectories and the consequent risks their policy-makers are willing to
take under these different circumstances. We offer less certainty
regarding Iranian and Turkish aspirations and the likelihood of their
successes. [The extent to which we can distinguish particular countries
as powers from the broader community of states largely depends
on]{.underline} three components: **[opportunity, willingness, and
competence]{.underline}**. As rising powers, these two [states have the
potential to gain membership to a high status-generating
club]{.underline}. [To do so, however, would require,]{.underline} even
for regional power status, [not only a vast commitment to increasing
their economic and mili- tary clout, but as well a substantial
commitment to their region of interest]{.underline} (the Middle East,
presumably). Even then, regional power status would only be conferred if
one of the two would substantially exceed the other both in capabilities
and activism in the region. That is not likely in the near future: the
costs, both domestic and international, would be too high for such a
status race. What would such a status race mean for governance,
especially regional governance in the Middle East? The role of rising
powers, as they navigate between the givens of their regions and the
pressures of global governance, is uncertain (e.g. Destradi, Nolte, &
Prys-Hansen,2018). In the case of Iran and Turkey, their limitations are
not the only issue. These two states (along with several other Middle
Eastern countries) are also sub- stantially constrained in a region by
several other regional power pretenders that also lack the capabilities
to dominate the region, but are caught in a dense set of rivalries that
make it exceedingly difficult for them not to resist the rise of a
regional power (Volgy, Gordell, & Bezerra,2019). One major lesson of the
[post-Cold War]{.underline} era, with respect to global governance, has
been that [it is far easier to create new regional institutions than to
create global ones]{.underline} (Volgy et al.,2009). No wonder then,
that much of the new formal architectural construction since 1990 has
been regional in scope, in Latin America (Brazil), Southern Africa
(South Africa) post-Soviet space (Russia), and Asia (China). Turkey and
Iran face different chal- lenges in their region: [there is no other
region as conflict-ridden andfilled with as many strategic rivalries as
the Middle East]{.underline} (Volgy et al.,2019), [making regional
governance exceedingly difficult]{.underline}, even if there was a
dominant power. 16 Ultimately, [the inability of rising powers to
effectively establish new architecture within this environment suggests
the need to keep this track record in mind when evaluating their
status-seeking strategies]{.underline}.

### 2AC/1NC -- ! -- War

#### Status competition causes war --- only [unipolarity]{.underline} can dampen conflict 

**Wohlforth, '9** - Professor of Government in the Dartmouth College
Department of Government (William C., \"Unipolarity, Status Competition,
and Great Power War\", Cambridge Core, January 2009,
https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/unipolarity-status-competition-and-great-power-war/3BCD0B8AB97EB360AD84C32658AF6906))SK

The [evidence suggests that narrow]{.underline} and asymmetrical
capabilities [gaps foster **status competition**]{.underline} [even
among states relatively confident of their basic territorial
security]{.underline} for the reasons identified in social identity
theory and theories of status competition. [Broad patterns of evidence
are consistent with this]{.underline} expectation, suggesting that
[unipolarity shapes strategies of identity]{.underline} maintenance [in
ways that **dampen status conflict**.]{.underline} The implication is
that [unipolarity helps explain low levels of military competition and
conflict]{.underline} among major powers [after 1991]{.underline} and
that [a return to **bipolarity or multipolarity** would increase the
likelihood of such **conflict**]{.underline}. This has been a
preliminary exercise. The evidence for the hypotheses explored here is
hardly conclusive, but it is sufficiently suggestive to warrant further
refinement and testing, all the more so given the importance of the
question at stake. If status matters in the way the theory discussed
here suggests, then the widespread view that the rise of a peer
competitor and the shift back to a bipolar or multipolar structure
present readily surmountable policy challenges is suspect. Most scholars
agree with Jacek Kugler and Douglas Lemke's argument: "\[S\]hould a
satisfied state undergo a power transition and catch up with dominant
power, there is little or no expectation of war." 81 [Given that today's
rising powers have every material reason to like the status quo, many
observers are optimistic that the rise of peer competitors can be
readily managed by fashioning an order that accommodates their material
interests.]{.underline} Yet it is far harder to manage competition for
status than for most material things. [While diplomatic efforts to
manage status competition seem easy]{.underline} under unipolarity,
theory and [evidence]{.underline} [suggest that it could present much
greater challenges as the system moves back to bipolarity or
multipolarity.]{.underline} When status is seen as a positional good,
efforts to craft negotiated bargains about status contests face long
odds. And this positionality problem is particularly acute concerning
the very issue unipolarity solves: primacy. [The route back to
bipolarity or multipolarity is thus **fraught with
danger.**]{.underline} [With two or more plausible claimants to primacy,
positional competition and the potential for **major power war** could
once again form the backdrop of world politics]{.underline}.

## Conflict Deaths/Pinker

### 2AC/1NC -- Battle Deaths Decreasing

#### Battle deaths are maintaining a downward trend -- improvements in medicine and NGOs

**Fazal, PhD, 14**

(Tanisha, Ph.D.: Political Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA,
2001. "Dead Wrong?: Battle Deaths, Military Medicine, and Exaggerated
Reports of War\'s Demise." 2014.
http://muse.jhu.edu/article/553214.)//bc

As a first cut in bringing a broader set of casualty data into the
discussion of the changing incidence of war, I provide wounded-to-killed
ratios for four of the most frequent belligerents from 1775 to 2008 (see
figure 3). Where possible, data on civil wars in which these countries
were involved are included as well. All four graphs in this figure
demonstrate a significant upward trajectory in wounded-to-killed ratios.
France sees a dramatic rise after World War II, while Israel and Russia
demonstrate steadier inclines; the U.S. ratio jumps during Operations
Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, in particular. In figure 4, I
assemble these and other data to graph wounded-to-killed ratios over the
past two centuries using a smoothed spline function to plot a curve
through the data.84 [The figure demonstrates an upward trend in
wounded-to-killed ratios, **especially beginning in the latter half of
the twentieth century.**]{.underline} Note that these data include
interstate wars (such as the world wars), extrasystemic wars (such as
the American War of Independence), and civil wars (such as Russia's wars
with Chechnya in the 1990s and Indonesia's civil wars with leftists).
Although an ideal next step would be to regress some function of time as
well as the wounded-to-killed ratio on battle deaths, missing data limit
my confidence in taking this path. [The PRIO battle death data aggregate
all battle deaths for all conflicts in a given year; the
wounded-to-killed dataset contains a much sparser grouping of
data]{.underline}. Running regressions on battle deaths would therefore
require imputing values for a significant amount of missing data. In the
online appendix, I take this approach and find that, [although the
year]{.underline} \[End Page 115\] [in which a conflict occurs tends to
be a significant predictor]{.underline} (and depressor) [of battle
deaths in bivariate regressions,]{.underline} **[the coefficient on
"year" tends to be both positive and statistically
insignificant]{.underline}** w[hen interpolated wounded-to-killed ratios
are included]{.underline} in the analysis. By contrast, [the coefficient
on the wounded-to-killed ratio is almost always negative]{.underline},
although significant in only some models.85 As wounded-to-killed ratios
improve, battle deaths decline. **[The data suggest that both battle
deaths and battle casualties are on the decline]{.underline}**.
Producing a revised version of figure 1's count of battle deaths based
on available data would be problematic, however, for two reasons. First,
doing so would require using predicted values of wounded-to-killed
ratios from figure 4 and then plugging these already imputed values into
the wounded-to-killed ratio formula (W/K = R, where W = wounded, K =
killed, and R = ratio) to generate an estimated number of wounded that
could then be added to the known number of killed. Not only would such a
line be empirically questionable, but it would look almost exactly like
figure 1, because it would be a function of those data. Second, it would
also look as though the number of battle deaths had not declined at all
while casualties were on the decline, because it would dramatically
increase the scale of the graph to account for the much greater number
of casualties than fatalities. In the absence of more comprehensive data
on the wounded, I take a simpler approach. [Rather than trying to impute
values for all of the years under consideration]{.underline}, **[I look
only at the endpoints in figure 1 to compare the percentage change in
battle deaths with (imputed) battle casualties]{.underline}**. As figure
5 shows, [from 1946 to 2008,]{.underline} **[the number of battle deaths
declined by 50 percent]{.underline}**. By contrast, [estimated battle
casualties during the same period declined by less than 20
percent]{.underline}. Thus, the data suggest that **[battle deaths
declined more than twice as quickly than battle casualties during this
time frame]{.underline}**. If this is true, then it may be premature to
declare victory on war. The findings represented in figure 5 and the
preceding analysis raise two additional points. First, more data on the
battle wounded are needed before making a true comparison between the
decline in battle deaths and the incidence of battle casualties. Second,
the available data suggest that, [even accounting for the battle wounded
and notwithstanding improvements in medical care in
conflict]{.underline} [zones]{.underline}, [the number of casualties of
war still fell]{.underline}. **[This finding tempers]{.underline}**, but
does not negate, **[the empirical claim made by Goldstein and Pinker
about the decline of war more generally]{.underline}**. Indeed, in many
ways it is consistent with their arguments. [Improvements in medical
care in conflict zones are partially]{.underline} \[End Page 116\] a
[result of the humanitarian revolution celebrated]{.underline} [by the
declinist theory of war.]{.underline} Nongovernmental organizations
([NGOs]{.underline}) such as the ICRC and Médicins sans Frontières (MSF)
[are now able to access conflict zones]{.underline}, and **[state
militaries make tremendous investments in the well-being of their
troops, both on and off the battlefield.]{.underline}**

#### Battle deaths are on a downward trend -- fewer interstate and civil wars post-Korean War

Battle." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 50, no. 3, 2006, pp.

To improve on the fatalities data for the COW conflicts we use estimates
gathered by Lacina and Gleditsch (2005) for the Uppsala/PRIO data set on
state-based armed conflicts between 1946 and 2002 (Gleditsch et al.
2002; Harbom and Wallensteen 2005). We matched the Lacina and Gleditsch
data to the COW conflict list and backdated the deaths data to 1900. Our
data are consistently limited, for all types of wars, to battle deaths
alone.5 Figure 2, plotting battle deaths divided by global population,
tracks this revised estimate of the likelihood or risk that an
individual person would die in state-based armed combat, from 1900 to
1997.6 Figure 3 presents the same graph from 1946 to 1997; the data are
identical but it is hard to identify recent trends visually in Figure 2
because of the extremely high values for World Wars I and II. **[The
data strongly refute the assertion that the risk of battle death is a
flat line.]{.underline}** [Rather there is a distinct apex in the era of
World Wars I and II]{.underline}. The trend in battle deaths worldwide
is also lumpy, revealing the influence of a few major conflicts within
each era. The first years of the twentieth century were marked by a
small spike in battle deaths in 1905-the Russo-Japanese War-and an
escalating trend in violence starting in 1910, driven by the Mexican
Revolution and the first and second Balkan Wars, and culminating in the
enormous death toll of World War I. The 1920s and 1930s were much less
deadly, but [numbers of battle deaths climbed again in the years leading
up to World War II,]{.underline} a conflict that caused more battle
deaths, more indirect deaths through disease and starvation, and claimed
more victims of genocide than any war before or since. Figure 3 shows
that [the post-1946 era has also been one of successive
spikes]{.underline} [in the number of battle deaths
worldwide,]{.underline} **[but each of these crises has generated fewer
deaths per year than that preceding it]{.underline}**. The 1950s were
bloodied by the Chinese civil war, the Korean War, and the French
Indochina war. [The next major peaks in the graph track the Cold War
proxy wars]{.underline} in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Similarly, in
the 1980s, the superpower-supplied Iran-Iraq War and the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan generated the largest battles. Finally, [at the end of
the Cold War]{.underline} [there is an upsurge in combat
death]{.underline}s due to war in the Balkans, former Soviet republics,
and Persian Gulf. The trend from that peak to 1997 was steadily
downward, with the most recent years being some of the most peaceful of
the last century. A few key features stand out in this review of battle
deaths in the twentieth century. First, the largest peaks in combat
deaths are in interstate wars, followed by internationalized civil wars,
and for the most part feature at least some conven- tional, rather than
guerilla, warfare. Purely conventional wars have been the most deadly.
[In the post-World War II period, each peak is lower than the last
reflecting,]{.underline} in part, that **[there has not been an
interstate conflict between major powers since the Korean
War.]{.underline}** Second, **[civil wars seem to have grown less
frequent]{.underline}** (Harbom, H6gbladh, and Wallensteen 2006),
**[less deadly, and less likely to become interna-
tionalized]{.underline}** [since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}
(Lacina 2006). [These trends reflect]{.underline} in part [the
de-escalation of the superpower rivalry and the declining levels of
superpower military aid to regional conflicts.]{.underline} For example,
[declining tension between the Unit- ed States and the USSR]{.underline}
**[sped the de-escalation of the Soviet war in
Afghanistan]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [decreased rates of
mortality there]{.underline} (Sliwinski 1989:40-41). [Other countries
expe- riencing]{.underline} the [dismantling of superpower
proxy]{.underline} [wars]{.underline} [include El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Namibia, and Cambodia.]{.underline} Table
1 shows a regression analysis of these data. Time is simply a yearly
index running from zero in 1900 up to 1997. An ordinary least-squares
regression for time as a predictor of battle deaths from 1900 to 1997
finds a downward linear trend, significant at the 90% confidence level.
Adjusting the model to allow for a nonlinear temporal trend reveals this
downward tendency even more clearly; the estimated coefficients on a
term for time and its square imply that [the]{.underline} [trend in
battle deaths over time has been an upside down parabola]{.underline}
with an apex in the early 1940s. **[There are also negative linear
trends in battle deaths in the post-World War period]{.underline}** [and
after the Cold War]{.underline} h[ave sounded a note of some optimism
about the international system]{.underline}. [The post-World War II
international system]{.underline} **[witnessed a remarkable decline in
the numbers of combat deaths worldwide]{.underline}**. This is in large
part [due to the decreasing incidence of interstate]{.underline} [and
Great-Power wars]{.underline}, the most deadly type of conflict humans
have ever faced, and to decreased casualty levels in civil wars due to
less frequent intervention by major powers. Thus, [the success of the
post-World War II period]{.underline} **[has been in building a
historically unprecedented network of peaceful ties]{.underline}** among
the most powerful states in the international system.8 The challenge
going into the twenty-first century is to expand these gains into areas
still torn by domestic conflict, terrorism, and interstate feuds.

There has been a great deal of alarmist writing about the bloody
post-Cold War era, often painted in the media as a world of
unprecedented internecine conflict. Snow (1996, pp. 1-2, 105-113) holds,
for instance, that armed conflicts of the 1990s, which he calls
\"uncivil wars,\" were less principled, less focused on political goals,
and therefore bloodier than many in the past. Sarkees et al. (2003, p.
65) strike a similar note of pessimism, arguing that the risk of
suffering death in battle has trended neither up nor down since the
Napoleonic wars. Such remarks are surprising given that [organisations
that monitor the global incidence of armed conflict have found that the
late 1990s and first years of the twenty-first century
enjoyed]{.underline} **[a downward trend in warfare]{.underline}**
[between and within states]{.underline} (Gleditsch et al., 2002; State
Failure Task Force, 2003). What do global trends in battle deaths tell
us about the amount of armed combat taking place in the world today?
Figure 2 provides our estimate of the global trend in battle deaths from
1946 to 2002 in state-based armed conflicts, while Table 1 notes the
five conflicts that inflicted the largest numbers of battle deaths
during that era. Figure 2 reveals that [the long-term trend in battle
deaths has been sharply downward. The late 1940s and early
1950s]{.underline} [were very grim]{.underline}; [the combined impact of
the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War were augmented by the French
Indochina War]{.underline} (estimated to have killed 365,000 in battle)
[and the Greek Civil War]{.underline} (154,000 battle deaths[). The
Vietnam War forms the next hump in the dataset,]{.underline} [and the
combined impacts of the Iran-Iraq]{.underline} [war]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the [Soviet intervention in Afghanistan constitute the
third peak]{.underline}. In the mid-1990s, the world seemed to enter
another trough in the number of battle deaths, until the war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with an estimated 145,000 battle
deaths in 1998-2001, and the interstate war between Ethiopia and Eritrea
that killed 50,000 from 1998 to 2000. **[Each peak is significantly
lower than the previous one]{.underline}** [and the trough in 2002 is
the lowest for the entire period]{.underline}.7 Thus, the good news
about battle deaths since World War II is that [although there have been
multiple major international security crises **their military scale has
progressively diminished**]{.underline}. [This may reflect]{.underline}
**[increasingly pacific behavior among the great powers]{.underline}**,
[who possess the resources]{.underline} and the military technology
(such as aerial power and heavy artillery) [to inflict large numbers of
battle deaths]{.underline} in the wars they start, join, or provide with
support. Each of the five largest conflicts identified was a war of this
type. [The Korean War and the Vietnam]{.underline} [War]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} massive [Cold War confrontations, and the Chinese
Civil War]{.underline} [was]{.underline} also [fed by superpower
military assistance.]{.underline} [The wars between Iran and Iraq and
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan were]{.underline} also
[driven]{.underline} in part [by the logic of Cold War]{.underline}
politics and the parties were armed by the US and USSR. By contrast,
[declining tension between]{.underline} the [superpowers]{.underline}
**[hastened the de-escalation of the Soviet war in
Afghanistan]{.underline}** **[and slowed rates of battle deaths there in
the late 1980s]{.underline}** (Sliwinski, 1989, pp. 40-41). And while
[the]{.underline} recent [war]{.underline} [in the DRC involved regional
armies]{.underline}, **[it was not a proxy war for major military
powers]{.underline}**. [The most cataclysmic battle]{.underline}s of the
past half-century [were related to the now defunct ideological
polarisation between East and West]{.underline}. The very [large
conflicts]{.underline} that these peaks represent [almost overwhelm the
rest of the curve]{.underline}: together, **[the five conflicts in Table
1 constitute more than half of the estimated toll of global battle
deaths in the period 1946-2002]{.underline}**, accounting for about 5.76
million battle deaths out of a total of about 10 million[. The five wars
with the highest number of battle deaths]{.underline}, especially the
Vietnam and Korean Wars, [are such outliers that they eclipse most of
the rest of the story of global warfare]{.underline}. Figure 3 shows the
graph of global battle deaths with those five largest conflicts
excluded. What seemed like a down ward trend in battle violence vanishes
and the world seems to fluctuate between high and low war intensity
years (although the final year is the lowest for the entire period).
Thus, the bad news about global battle deaths is that, although the
now-terminated Cold War played a devastating role in driving major
battle death events, there is a persistence of smaller scale, more
diverse conflicts, the trend in which is less obvious. Even so, [the
data by no means support the sombre picture]{.underline} painted by
Sarkees et al. (2003) [of a world of]{.underline} basically [constant
total rates of combat.]{.underline} Table 2 shows that the mean and
median numbers of battle deaths in a year of conflict after the Cold War
era were significantly lower than during the Cold War. Nor do we find
support for Snow\'s hypothesis of increasingly bloody civil conflicts,
at least when measured according to the number of battle deaths; [the
mean and median number]{.underline} [of combat fatalities in a
year]{.underline} of internal or internationalised internal conflict
**[have fallen dramatically since the end of the Cold
War.]{.underline}**

[OMG]{.underline} join Sarkees, Wayman, and Singer (2003) in
[challenging the claim that war deaths have been
declining]{.underline}.16 OMG criticize what they describe as \"strong
claims made on the basis of current data from media reports\" to the
effect that \"the number of deaths related to war has declined
consistently since the mid-20th century and that recent wars have killed
relatively few people\" (2008b, 6). This claim they argue should be
\"reevaluated.\" Contrary to OMG, [we are not aware of any conflict
researcher who has claimed that the decline has been
\"consistent]{.underline}\" -- [it has been highly uneven]{.underline}
as Figure 1 shows.17 Second, [the most prominent and well-documented
\"strong clai]{.underline}m\" [in the literature is that battle-deaths,
not war deaths, have declined. OMG\'s claim that there is no evidence
for a decline in war **deaths is based exclusively on taking the PRIO
data**]{.underline} displayed in Figure 1 and then using their thirteen
WHO survey estimates to transform the PRIO data so that they no longer
show a clear downward trend, and even increase slightly for 1985 through
1994 compared to 1975 through 1984, shown below in Figure 2. However,
[the method that they use to reach this conclusion is neither sound nor
convincing]{.underline}. First, [if the authors wished to challenge the
PRIO]{.underline} [finding]{.underline} that battle-deaths have
declined, [they should have used the same period for comparison in both
cases. They fail to do]{.underline} [this]{.underline}. The series of
ten-year periods OMG use to support their claim that fatalities are not
declining starts in 1955 and ends in 1994. But, as is obvious from an
inspection of the plots below, **[the PRIO data set shows much higher
deaths before 1955,]{.underline}** **[and much lower deaths after
1994]{.underline}** [than it does for the period between these years
covered in the OMG picture]{.underline}. [The WHO fatality tolls miss
the Korean War]{.underline}? the second deadliest conflict since World
War II. They also miss the decline in battle deaths between 1994 and
2002. [The battle-death count in 2002 was only 22 percent of the 1994
count]{.underline} according to the UCDP/PRIO version of the PRIO data
set.18 Once again OMG fail, quite inappropriately, to compare like with
like. Second, [no claims about global fatality trends can be made with
any confidence based on a nonrandom convenience sample of just thirteen
countries]{.underline}. **[The OMG sample contains only 18 percent of
the seventy-one countries that experienced conflict during the period
covered by the WHO surveys]{.underline}** (1955-2002) according to the
Correlates of War version of the PRIO data set used by OMG.19 Such a
small convenience sample cannot provide a reliable basis for
extrapolation. [The PRIO data set,]{.underline} however, [records
battle-death fatalities in all countries that experience armed
conflict]{.underline}. [These latter data can legitimately be used to
make claims about global trends; the former cannot]{.underline}. Third,
[OMG perform statistical analysis on their small and dubiously selected
convenience sample,]{.underline} [fitting a line to a mere thirteen data
points that give OMG esti mates and PRIO figures for the thirteen
countries in the OMG sampl]{.underline}e. Figure 3 gives a scatter plot
of these data points that shows Ethiopia to be an outlier and Vietnam to
be a huge outlier. The remaining eleven estimates become an indistinct
\"splotch\" of clustered points near the origin. Essentially, [OMG fit a
line to only three data points, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and the \"splotch\"
that represents the other eleven countries.]{.underline}

### 2AC/1NC -- Violent Deaths Decreasing

#### Overall patterns of violent death statistics show larger civilizations *[decrease]{.underline}* the rates of violent death

In his sweeping 2011 work The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence
has Declined[, Steven Pinker makes the audacious claim, "today we may be
living in the most peaceable era in our species'
existence."]{.underline} To someone who pays even a little attention to
constant news reports of violence, both local and international, this
statement sounds ludicrous. The grandeur of this assertion should
immediately raise our suspicions; as the science popularizer Carl Sagan
often said, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." Does
Pinker have that evidence and does he interpret it correctly? Over the
course of 800 pages, Pinker makes a convincing argument with numbers,
figures, and references to many books and articles. Nonetheless, it's
critical that we don't rely on a single argument to form our worldview.
We must remember that data is never objective, and therefore we need to
look at the data itself as well as multiple expert interpretations. In
this article, we'll examine the global violent conflict data and
different stances on the same numbers. (As a note, Pinker's work deals
with all forms of violence from the individual --- homicides, abuse ---
to the worldwide, but here we'll focus on international violent
conflicts --- war --- and leave the rest for future articles). This is
Episode 2 of the Reality Project, an endeavor with the aim of becoming
less wrong about the world with data. You can find all the articles
here. (I'd like to emphasize I'm not trying to minimize the atrocities
of war by presenting only data. It can be easy to lose track that we are
talking about people when looking at numbers and every loss of human
life is a tragedy.) The Data Our primary sources of derived data on the
more positive side will be The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven
Pinker and the "War and Peace" page on Our World in Data. For a
contrasting viewpoint, we'll use "Steven Pinker is Wrong" by John Gray
and "The Decline of Conflict: What Do the Data Really Say?" by Pasquale
Cirillo and Nassim Nicholas Taleb. You can find raw data for your own
analysis at The Conflict Catalog or the World Bank. The first question
we need to ask to assess violence today is how violent was the past.
While extremely reliable data is difficult to come by, anthropologists
use archaeological evidence to determine causes of death and therefore
approximate the rates of violence in a society. These results are shown
in the following graphs of percentages of deaths that come from violent
conflict in prehistoric and non-state societies (from Our World in
Data). Percentage of deaths attributed to violence in prehistoric and
nonstate societies [The percentages of individuals killed by violence
ranges from about 60% to less than 5% in both prehistoric and nonstate
societies]{.underline}. Those numbers are almost meaningless until we
put them in perspective with modern figures: Percentage of deaths
attributed to violence in state societies The most relevant entries are
the final two. [The US and Europe from 1900--1960, even with two world
wars, saw less than 1% of their population perish in armed conflicts. In
2007, just 0.04% of deaths in the world were from international
violence]{.underline}. [If this data is correct, the world in 2007 was
at least an order of magnitude safer than most prehistoric
societies]{.underline}. [We can also look at the same data in a slightly
different manner, as the violent deaths per 100,000 citizens per
year]{.underline}. Left: violent deaths per 100,000 citizens per year in
non-state societies. Right: same data for state societies. **[Here we
again see the same pattern of lower violence in modern
times]{.underline}**. On the left are non-state societies and on the
right are state societies. Focusing on the bottom 3 rows of the
right-hand table, [we can see the strikingly low rates of violent death
among modern societies, even accounting for two world wars]{.underline}.
Again, it's worth stressing the data here is not complete, but [what is
available suggests]{.underline} the following hypothesis: [prehistoric
and nonstate societies experienced much higher rates of violence than
modern state societies]{.underline}. As Pinker and others (notably Jared
Diamond) have made clear, [**the "noble savage" idea is entirely
false**. People]{.underline} did not live peacefully with one another
when they were organized in tribes and then become more violent as they
were civilized, but the opposite: they **[were extremely violent in
tribes and gradually became less so as larger
civilizations]{.underline}** were built **[and commerce started to
connect the world]{.underline}** (this highlights two of the drivers in
the decline of global war --- trade and powerful states --- that we'll
look at shortly). Even accounting for the atrocities wrought by
nation-states **[in the 20th century, rates of violent death appear to
be lower now than at any previous point.]{.underline}**

### 2AC/1NC -- Trade Disincentives War

#### Trade disincentivizes war by making the costs of war outweigh its benefits 

**Koehrsen**, **1-5**-2019

[The theory of gentle commerce can be summed up in two statements:
**When it's cheaper to buy something than to steal something, the
economics wins Our neighbors**]{.underline} --- both within and outside
our country --- are worth more to us alive than dead because exchanges
are positive-sum Why don't you steal a loaf of bread from the grocery
store? [Although most people believe they don't steal because it's the
wrong thing to do, the real reason is more mundane: in our society, the
potential cost of getting caught stealing]{.underline} --- jail time and
social ostracization --- [are higher than the cost to purchase
items]{.underline}. When people are provided a legal means to obtain
their goods that is cheaper than violence, they will take the legal
option. We explored the second point in "The Disappearing Poor", but
it's worth reiterating. Without exchanges in a market economy, all
interactions between humans are zero-sum: you can steal something from
me, but your gain is offset by my loss so humanity is no better off; the
size of the economy stays the same. However, **[in an exchange of goods,
both parties come out better ahead.]{.underline}** Exchange also allows
for specialization so different individuals/countries can make the goods
for which they are best suited. [Moreover, as trade continues, countries
become dependent on one another because they no longer make all the
goods they need.]{.underline} [The end result]{.underline} of exchange
[is]{.underline} more plentiful goods at cheaper prices for all parties
and [improved international relations.]{.underline} Over the past
several hundred years, we have slowly built up an international
marketplace where all players are heavily dependent on one another. [The
US will not fight with another major power,]{.underline} not because she
couldn't defeat them, but **[because the economic losses would far
outweigh the gains]{.underline}**. As discussed by Pinker, **[countries
that depend more on each other for trade are less likely to have a
violent conflict controlling for other factors.]{.underline}** In
summary, the financial incentives have switched from war to trade for
most nations.

### AT: Conflicts Increasing

#### **Even if the amount of conflicts has increased, newer technologies lowers the number of deaths in conflict**

**Koehrsen**, **1-5**-2019

reserve university, Applied data science researcher and data scientist
for cortex building intelligence, \"Has Global Violence Declined? A Look

[It's worth looking into the period of time for which we have the best
data: the modern age]{.underline}. In particular, we'll zoom [in on the
post-1945 era]{.underline}, a time that Pinker has classified as "The
Long Peace". From this vantage point, **[things look very
good]{.underline}**. As noted by Pinker, [since 1953, there have been
zero conflicts between major world powers]{.underline} (the exception
since WW2 was the Korean War) [and there have been zero internationally
recognized states that have gone out of existence]{.underline} through
conquest since 1945. When we look at the data on battle deaths per
100,000 people in state-based conflicts, [we see a significant decline
since World War Two]{.underline}. State-based violent conflict deaths
from World War Two on Since the end of the second world war, **[the rate
of deaths from all conflicts has decreased, with the most noticeable
decline in conflicts between states]{.underline}**. Most of the
remaining battle deaths occur in civil conflicts, such as the tragic
civil war in Syria that has been ongoing since 2011. Moreover, many of
these civil wars involve foreign states, and the argument could be made
major states have stopped fighting each other directly but engage
through other conflicts. One discouraging bit of news in contrast to the
above graph is the number of overall state conflicts since the second
world war: Number of state-based conflicts since the end of World War
Two While the number of battle-related deaths (in the rate of people
killed / 100,000 / year) has decreased, [the total number of conflict is
rising]{.underline}. **[This tells us that, contrary to what we might
think as weapon technology advances, violent conflicts are resulting in
fewer battle deaths]{.underline}**. [While, there are more civil
conflicts around the globe, these tend to be **less catastrophic than
wars between major powers**.]{.underline} Fortunately, [the wars between
major states have been on the decline]{.underline} --- even including
the entire 20th century --- **[and show no signs of
reversal]{.underline}**. We can see this in the final chart of section
showing the percent of the time major powers have been at war over the
past 500 years (grouped into 25-year periods). Percent of Years in which
Great Powers Fought One Another (bunched into 25-year periods). There
has been a clear decline in the percentage of years in which the major
powers fought with one another since at least 1600. At one point the
rate reached 100% --- indicating there was at least one conflict between
world powers for the entire 25-year period. Contrast that with 2000,
when there were 0 conflicts between world powers. The current period of
66 years without a conflict between major powers is the longest time
since at least the Roman Empire. After an exploration of the data thus
far, Pinker's argument looks to be holding up: the rate of death in
battle for modern state societies in war is much lower than prehistoric
and non-state societies even accounting for the world wars. Furthermore,
the major powers no longer fight one another and while the number of
civil conflicts has increased, these result in fewer deaths than
conflicts between major states. However, before we consider this case to
be closed we need to talk about one fundamental issue.

## Ethnocentrism

### 2AC/1NC -- Implicit Bias

#### Human nature and implicit biases make competition inevitable -- recent studies prove

**Müller 19**, \[Harald Müller is the head of the Peace Studies
Foundation of Hesse and Professor of International Relations at the
University of Frankfurt. For many years he was the disarmament advisor
to the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan\], (7-6-2019, \"Justice
from an Interdisciplinary Perspective: The Impact of the Revolution in
Human Sciences on Peace Research and International Relations\",

7-18-2019), //Snitty

[The impact of the justice issue in society and politics hinges on the
ambivalent and contradictory predispositions of the human
mind.]{.underline} Here I follow Boehm's summary of this problem.
Accordingly, **[we have inherited the disposition to dominance,
submission, and resentment of dominance side by side.]{.underline}**
Together with our dispositions for prosocial attitudes such as empathy,
compassion, a sense of fairness, and the drive for cooperation and
community, [we harbor in our brain structure dispositions to egotism,
nepotism (that is, to show prosocial behavior and accompanying emotions
only to a small ingroup) and universally-directed altruism]{.underline}.
[These dispositions are stratified as they manifest themselves in
decreasing strength the wider the circle of possible beneficiaries
is]{.underline}. **[All this is not simply culturally constructed, but
"anchored in human nature"]{.underline}** (Boehm
[2001](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR16),
pp. 225 ff.; for recent empirical support see Magraw-Mickelson and
Gollwitzer
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR74)).
Boehm summarizes: [The evolutionary saga ends with a species altruistic
enough to cooperate quite efficiently in large or small groups, but at
the same time prone to competition and conflict]{.underline}...Our most
amazing accomplishments are complex societies that verge on being
antlike in their divisions of labor and organic cooperation -- and also
in their unusual capacity to go to war (Boehm
[2001](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR16),
p. 254). It goes without saying that, like all genetic dispositions, the
ones discussed here are distributed among people unequally: [Most
individuals have all of them, but in different strengths]{.underline}
(McDermott
[2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR1002),
p. 558). In addition, [the preceding discussion indicates that our
dispositions are varied and contradictory enough to present the basis
for "radically different behavioral outcomes at the level of the
phenotype", because they make an almost unlimited variety of
combinations possible]{.underline} (Boehm
[2001](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR16),
pp. 236 f.). [One particular dark side of our capability to feel and
think in justice terms is our inclination to frame justifications in
terms of justice arguments when we explain why we do (or have done) harm
to others]{.underline}. [They can be framed as dealing out retributive
justice to a rule-breaker (including revenge); justifications can also
be derived from the inherently unjust nature of our
opponent]{.underline} (such as the "unjust enemy" of Immanuel Kant
\[Müller
[2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR86)\]).
[From there it is only a small step to the argument that we were
justified in doing harm to a person to prevent or limit harm being done
to third parties (protection) or ourselves (self-defense)]{.underline}
(Baumeister
[1997](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR13)).
In order to understand the power of the justice factor in politics, it
is essential to overcome the methodological individualism that still
permeates the social sciences. There is still intense discussion about
the possibility of states being "actors", of groups having collective
identities or of the masses having shared feelings. For sociologists or
economists versed in group experiments or for neuroscientists measuring
brain activity during collective experiences the issue has long been
settled. [In recent years, neuroscientists have identified practices
that stimulate regions in the brain whose neuronal circuits trigger
particularly intense we-feelings simultaneously among entire groups of
participants]{.underline}. [These involve synchronous movement or vocal
actions such as marching, dancing, singing, rhythmic
shouting]{.underline} (e.g., of slogans), etc. (Farmer and Maister
[2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR36),
pp. 338 ff.). [Taking part in a mass demonstration or in the vocal
support of the home team in an exciting football match creates an
emotional identity that can be mobilized for good or
bad]{.underline}---[Hitler knew that all too well]{.underline} (Crawford
[2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR23),
p. 536) [as did the perpetrators of the Rwanda genocide]{.underline}
(Ross
[2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR93)).
At a more complex level, **[emotions can be collectivized by
institutionalization]{.underline}** (Crawford
[2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR23)).
Collective emotions in this sense---[the uniform focusing of emotions by
many individuals on the same target---is characteristic of justice
claims by groups adhering to identity concepts such as nation, ethnic
group, religion, or ideology.]{.underline} These are possibly the most
devastating grouping frames in terms of their capability to direct
common identity into collective violence against outsiders (Pinker
[2011](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR89),
pp. 824 ff.). [Collective emotions can thus also be ascribed to, and
mobilized by, states]{.underline} (Mercer
[2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-25196-3_2#CR79)).

[Results show that oxytocin creates intergroup bias because it motivates
in-group favoritism and, in some cases, out-group
derogation]{.underline}. These findings provide evidence for the idea
that [neurobiological mechanisms in general, and oxytocinergic systems
in particular, **evolved to sustain and facilitate within-group
coordination and cooperation**. This]{.underline} notion [is further
supported by the fact that oxytocin modulated in-group
favoritism]{.underline} across different measures and generalizes
[across the two natural out-groups studied here.]{.underline} There are
notable differences in the characteristics of and stereotypic
perceptions vis-à-vis out-groups of Arab immigrants and Germans (refs.
30--33; Materials and Methods). However, [across experiments, effects
for oxytocin on in-group favoritism were strikingly
similar]{.underline}. [It thus seems that oxytocin's effects on ingroup
favoritism are relatively immune to cultural norms, exposure,
between-group differences in socio-economic status, and the
like.]{.underline} Although results provided consistent support for the
hypothesis that oxytocin motivates in-group favoritism, limited support
was found for the hypothesis that oxytocin drives out-group derogation.
Evidence was obtained in experiment 1, and to a lesser extent in
experiment 2, where [we gauged ethnocentrism through implicit measures
that tap into biases operating outside of volitional control
(]{.underline}45). [This finding resonates with work showing that
testosterone]{.underline} in humans [reduces automatic fear responses
but not]{.underline} volitionally controlled, [self-reports of
anxiety]{.underline} (46). Alternatively, it may be that intergroup bias
is driven more by in-group favoritism and that out-group derogation
plays a relatively minor role. In-groups are psychologically
primary---people live in them and, sometimes, for them (47)---and
in-group favoritism has strong adaptive value and facilitates
within-group coordination and survival. Allport (47) already conjectured
that there is good reason to believe that the in-group love--prejudice
effect is far more basic to human life than is the out-group
hate--prejudice effect, and research on human ethnocentrism supported
this positive-- Fig. 3**[. Oxytocin reduces the willingness to sacrifice
in-group targets to save a larger collective but not the readiness to
sacrifice out-group targets.]{.underline}** Results range from 0 to 5

asymmetry of social discrimination (29, 48). Current findings on the
role of oxytocin fit this positive--negative asymmetry, showing that
oxytocin creates intergroup bias primarily because it motivates in-group
favoritism and not because it motivates out-group derogation. [The
research designs in experiments 1 and 2 assessed in-group favoritism in
the context of intergroup comparisons]{.underline}---participants
responded to both in-group and out-group targets. [In experiment 3,
participants either first responded to in-group targets and then to
out-group targets or vice versa.]{.underline} Importantly, order of
target presentation did not qualify our findings, suggesting that
in-group favoritism emerged regardless of whether judgments were
rendered on in-group targets before or after judgments had been rendered
on out-group targets. [Experiments 4 and 5 exposed participants to
either in-group targets or to out-group targets (but not
both)]{.underline} and thus provided an assessment of in-group
favoritism in absence of an explicit intergroup comparison. Again,
support was found for the hypotheses that oxytocin creates intergroup
bias because it motivates in-group favoritism. Put differently, oxytocin
motivated in-group favoritism both when an intergroup comparison was
salient (experiments 1 and 2) and when such an intergroup comparison was
substantially more implicit (experiments 3--5). [Together, these results
suggest that in-group favoritism emerges regardless of whether an
explicit out-group comparison is rendered salient]{.underline}. However,
we should be cautious in concluding that oxytocin motives in-group
favoritism in the pure absence of intergroup comparisons, and future
research could invest in examining oxytocin's effects on in-group
favoritism (and out-group derogation) in the explicit absence of
intergroup comparisons (see ref. 43 for a guiding example). Through its
influence on in-group favoritism, oxytocin contributes to the
development of intergroup bias and preferential treatment of in-group
over out-group members. Because such unfair treatment triggers negative
emotions, violent protest, and aggression among disfavored and excluded
individuals (49), by stimulating in-group favoritism, brain oxytocin may
trigger a chain reaction toward intense between-group conflict. This
possibility questions the rather widespread view of oxytocin as a
"cuddle chemical" or "love drug" (24). There is no doubt that oxytocin
is implicated in the development of trust (10, 18), empathy, and
prosociality (11), but these tendencies appear limited to individuals
belonging to one's in-group (16, 17). Thus, rather than making humans
prosocial, [oxytocin functions to strengthen an evolutionary evolved and
rather functional tendency to discriminate between in-group and
out-group as well as to give members of one's own group preferential
treatment]{.underline}. [Such ethnocentrism has adaptive value to
individuals and their groups but, unfortunately, also **paves the way
for intergroup bias, conflict, and violence**]{.underline}.

#### Posterior Medial Frontal Cortex studies prove Ethnocentrism is *[precognitive --]{.underline}* *[neural resonance]{.underline}* enables the cooperation of in-groups while differences lead to the derogation of out-groups

Threat, Ideological Commitment, and the [Posterior Medial Frontal
Cortex]{.underline} The pMFC [includes the dorsal anterior cingulate
cortex (dACC) and the dorsomedial prefrontal area anterior to the
supplementary motor cortex (dmPFC).]{.underline} The pMFC has been
implicated in an array of reactions to negative stimuli21,22,23. The
pMFC contributes to the detection of discrepancies between current and
preferred conditions, as well as to subsequent decision-making
adjustment of behavior to reduce such discrepancies24,25,26. For
example, the dACC has been implicated in relatively low-level cognitive
control functions such as those measured in the Stroop, Flanker, divided
attention, or Go/No-Go tasks25. Similarly, at a higher level of
abstraction, the dACC component of [the pMFC is hypothesized to evoke
**intensified expressions of ideological commitment to moral or cultural
values following exposure to threats**]{.underline} (e.g., reminders of
uncertainty or death)17,18. [Cues of the concept of death have been
found to similarly trigger activity]{.underline} in the dmPFC27,28 and
to [intensify ideological expressions]{.underline} (e.g., national
identification, punishment of norm-violators)14. **[Cues of social
isolation have likewise been observed to heighten
ethnocentrism]{.underline}**12 and to activate the dACC29. [The dmPFC
component of the pMFC is a]{.underline} particularly plausible
**[inhibitor of prosociality toward out-group members]{.underline}**, as
the dmPFC is considered important to modulating the treatment of self
versus other during social decision-making30,31. A growing [literature
suggests]{.underline} that [human prosocial inclinations-most pronounced
toward fellow in-group members,]{.underline} all else being equal-may
partially [derive from a tendency for feelings]{.underline} and
behaviors [to activate similar neural systems]{.underline}, whether
originating in the self or [in another]{.underline}32. **[The extent of
this self-other neural resonance has been found to predict prosocial
behavior]{.underline}**33,34,35. Consistent with the role of coalitional
bias in moderating prosociality, neural resonance and related prosocial
behaviors are influenced by factors such as group identity36,32. The
modulation of prosociality contingent on group identification may owe to
mechanisms of inhibitory prefrontal cognitive control involving the
dmPFC, as the dmPFC is important for the tonic control of spontaneous
imitation37,30, as well as for shifting between the perspectives of self
and other38. Most compellingly, downregulating the dmPFC causes greater
financial sharing behavior39, directly implicating the dmPFC as
inhibiting prosociality, plausibly including the suppression of
prosociality on the basis of out-group affiliation. These relatively
high-level social functions of the dmPFC may be understood as
manifestations of a larger role of the dmPFC in various cognitive
control functions40. For example, experimentally upregulating the dmPFC
was recently shown to enhance impulse control in an asocial
delay-discounting paradigm in which participants who postpone immediate
reward receive greater future reward41. The pMFC complex appears
responsive to cues of the presence of various sorts of social
discrepancies, and [pMFC activity predicts behavioral shifts designed to
reduce said discrepancies]{.underline}42. For instance, [pMFC activity
correlates with preference changes in a manner that appears to reduce
cognitive dissonance]{.underline}43,44,45 [or to **heighten social
conformity following evidence that a person\'s opinions deviate from the
group consensus**46]{.underline},47. In a demonstration of the causal
role of the pMFC in enabling such dynamics, the experimental
downregulation of pMFC activity via TMS has been shown to decrease
social conformity despite cues of disagreement with the group48. In sum,
upon detection of relatively low-level problems such as receiving a
negative outcome in a motor task24, or relatively high-level problems
such as a deviation between a person\'s stated views and those of
his/her peers, the pMFC appears involved in the activation of networks
that coordinate problem-relevant responses23,47,49. Considered together,
the overall pattern of results implicates the pMFC as part of
neurobiological architecture evolved to manage challenges spanning
various low-level and high-level domains[. Accordingly, when
participants are presented with an out-group member\'s critique of their
group, the pMFC would hypothetically be involved in detecting this
conflict and with coordinating a typical response: **derogation of that
out-group critic and their ideas.** By the same logic, the pMFC is
predicted to help enable individuals confronted with their own mortality
to amplify their belief in a pleasant afterlife]{.underline}. If so,
then participants for whom the pMFC complex has been downregulated may
be expected to evince less derogation of critical out-group members and
less religious belief following reminders of the inevitability of death.

#### Ethnocentrism/in out distinction is intrinsic to human nature

Egoism and dominance are important mechanisms for attaining security,
but also important is attaining security from members of other groups.
In fact, [interactions with people from other
groups]{.underline}---unrelated others that may not have shared
interests---**[may be especially costly or lethal compared to
within-group interactions]{.underline}**. [Evolutionary theory provides
an important framework for understanding the ingroup/outgroup
distinction]{.underline} commonly noted by anthropologists,
sociologists, and political scientists, and perhaps most prominently by
psychologists.120,121 Of the many biases identified in the so-called
cognitive revolution in psychology, the ingroup/outgroup bias is one of
most pervasive, pernicious, and powerful. The key finding is that
[humans quickly adopt an ''us'']{.underline} (ingroup) [versus
''them'']{.underline} (outgroup) [worldview]{.underline}. We are
positively biased toward our own groups and negatively biased toward
other groups. Psychologists argue that the ingroup/outgroup distinction
develops from a need for social identity. [Identification with a
specific group provides individuals with meaning and
purpose,]{.underline} encouraging them to become part of a community
with common interests, values, and goals.122,123,124 [One also knows
what one is not]{.underline}---[the outgroup, which is stereotyped and
homogenized as the ''Other.'']{.underline} Among the many different
possible ingroup categories, the most common and significant include
family, friends, age, sex, class, ethnicity, politics, religion, and
nationality. **[The ubiquity and strength of the ingroup/outgroup bias
across history and across human cultures suggest it is an ingrained
aspect of human nature,]{.underline}** and [evolutionary theory
explains]{.underline} [why such a mechanism would
evolve]{.underline}.125,126,127 First, considerable evidence from both
[archeological and ethnographic research]{.underline} on preindustrial
societies [points to intensive intergroup conflict]{.underline} in our
past.128,129,130,131,132,133 As we noted earlier, [around 15 percent of
male]{.underline} [populations]{.underline} in indigenous small-scale
societies [died in warfare]{.underline} (and, in some such societies,
war-related mortality rates were considerably higher).134,135 [War also
remains a significant influence on]{.underline} the [social
organization]{.underline} and physical distribution of these societies
even when they are not actually at war. In human history and prehistory,
[other human groups were commonly the most dangerous threat in the
environment,]{.underline} **[and the ingroup/outgroup bias is likely to
have helped the ingroup remain cohesive]{.underline}**, [avoid and be
wary of outgroups, solve the collective action problem in emergencies,
and kill outsiders]{.underline}.136,137,138 Second, the ingroup/outgroup
bias offers a rapid heuristic to weigh the various threats when
encountering other humans. Will the outsider be a threat to oneself or
to one's family? Will an outsider compete for the current or future
resources that the insiders need to survive or expand? Will a male from
the outgroup present competition for mates, or will his presence
threaten the ingroup male's position in the extended family or group? In
[environments where resources are highly contested]{.underline},
**[outgroup fear can become extreme]{.underline}**. For example,
Wrangham recounts that among the Inuit of the Arctic, ''[unfamiliar men
would normally be killed even before questions were
asked]{.underline}.''139 Such wariness of individuals from other groups
is paralleled among animals. For example, [among wolves, lions, and
chimpanzees, when members of rival groups are found alone, they are
extremely vulnerable and risk being killed]{.underline}.140,141,142 We
discussed intergroup killing in chimpanzees earlier, but the pattern is
notable among social carnivores, too: [Studies of undisturbed wolf
populations in Alaska have found that 39 to 65 percent of adult deaths
were due to intergroup killing]{.underline}.143 Of course, the ability
to assess threats is much more complex in humans than it is in other
animals, and human intelligence gives us a greater repertoire of
behavior. Thus, [humans may consider other variables]{.underline}, [such
as the possibility of future trade or cooperation]{.underline}, [when
assessing outgroups.]{.underline} Still, humans exhibit an instinctive
fight or flight response, just as other animals do, which operates below
(and faster than) conscious awareness.144,145 [Befriending or
cooperating with a stranger may have benefits]{.underline}, **[but those
benefits are uncertain and limited whereas the costs of trusting an
outsider may be lethal]{.underline}**. It is therefore no surprise, as
psychologists have argued, that evolution has favored a bias to be
fearful of strangers to avoid the costlier error.146,147

#### Precognitive ethnocentrism is a consequence of the evolutionary need to protect wealth and fear threats to the dominance hierarchy

[The in-group/out-group distinction is important to evolutionary
theory\'s explanation of offensive realism]{.underline} because [it
explains why humans created these ideas]{.underline} [and why we often
fear out-groups]{.underline}. [When the out-group is another state**, we
can see it as a threat to our state\'s resources or
territory,**]{.underline} or [to our elite\'s political or economic
interests]{.underline}. By explaining the origins of the distinction
between in-groups and out-groups, evolutionary theory shows why [humans
make the distinction readily]{.underline}, whether it is a sports fan\'s
trivial in-group/outgroup distinction, or a nontrivial, life-or-death
distinction held by a Hutu or a Tutsi, a kulak or a commissar, a friend
or foe. Humans make in-group/out-group distinctions for three reasons.
First, [humans seek resources-food]{.underline}, [water, and shelter-to
care for themselves and relatives]{.underline}, and they seek mates to
reproduce their genotype; in sum, [they are egoistic for the reasons
advanced by]{.underline} Darwin, William Hamilton, and other
[evolutionary theorists]{.underline}, as I described in chapter 1 and in
the discussion above. [They are unlikely to assist those who are not
related]{.underline}, but may do so occasionally, expecting reciprocal
behavior. **[Humans behave in these ways because resources were
scarce]{.underline}** in the late-Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene
environments in which we evolved. In that environment, it is [easy to
understand why humans would prefer more resources to fewer:]{.underline}
**[more strength is preferable to less strength, more wealth to less
wealth, domination to being dominated]{.underline}**. Most people do
indeed prefer more resources to fewer; [the rich want even more wealth,
and seldom say they are too wealthy.]{.underline} Rather, **[they seem
to worry about protecting their wealth from those who may take it from
them]{.underline}**, [such as revolutionaries or the
government]{.underline}. In essence, in prehistoric times when there was
too little to go around, [humans discriminated between self and others,
family and others, tribe and others, in-groups and
out-groups.]{.underline} **[This behavior remains today.]{.underline}**
We [humans are likely to perceive out-groups]{.underline} **[as threats
to our resources]{.underline}**, the resources we need to maintain
ourselves and our families and extended in-groups such as the tribe or
state. Second, living and evolving in dangerous environments, humans,
like other animals, need the ability to assess threats rapidly and react
quickly. [The ingroup/out-group distinction may be thought of as the
human mind\'s immediate threat assessment]{.underline}. **[It is a
mechanism for determining whether or not nonrelated conspecifics
presented a threat]{.underline}**. In sum, our [mind rapidly
debates]{.underline}: [no threat/threat]{.underline}. Is the outsider a
threat to oneself or to one\'s family? As a result, [over the course of
human evolution]{.underline}, **[strangers were first likely to fear one
another,]{.underline}** at least until they became familiar. Third, in
addition to the immediate threat posed by conspecifics, [humans also
learned to assess fairly quickly whether the outsider was a threat in
the long run to the in-group]{.underline}, **[or to one\'s position in
the dominance hierarchy.]{.underline}** Members of the in-group might
ask whether the presence of an individual or group would be a threat to
their future resources-the scarce and precious resources needed to
survive. The [evolutionary origins of this distinction suggest that
elites]{.underline}, as people, [will also fear other
states]{.underline} **[because they are the out-group]{.underline}**
[and may have the power to take control if the elites cannot deter an
attack]{.underline}. Thus, evolutionary theory explains why people will
be egoistic, strive to dominate, and create ingroups and out-groups, and
this explains why people, especially leaders of states, are likely to
behave as offensive realism expects.

#### Ethnocentrism is [inevitable]{.underline} --- simulations prove that it's the dominant strategy --- refer to the graph

[The moral of this story]{.underline} is: form [groups]{.underline},
[cooperate with members]{.underline} of your own group, [and
exclude]{.underline} members of [other
groups]{.underline}---balkanization as survival. The point of [Hammond
and Axelrod]{.underline}\'s work on this is to [highlight a possible
evolutionary mechanism underlying inherent tendencies
toward]{.underline} unjust group [discrimination, such as **implicit
bias**]{.underline}. My point in describing it here is to demonstrate
why [we **cannot rely on** the open-mindedness of the **philosophy
community** to be naturally inclusive]{.underline}. [There are **forces
acting against inclusion**]{.underline}, [one]{.underline} of which is
inherent in each individual---and [that is to exclude the alien
voice]{.underline}---and at its most visceral it can be experienced as a
matter of survival. [To make this]{.underline} point more [vivid, we can
advert to a]{.underline} computer-generated agent-based
[simulation]{.underline}. This was created following Axelrod and Hammond
by Uri Wilensky8 in a software program of Wilensky\'s creation called
NetLogo. [The sim]{.underline}ulation [uses different colored shapes to
signify the four different kinds of agents and their
ethnicities]{.underline}. Shapes representing the four kinds of agents
are: • [Solid circle]{.underline}: [the
altruist]{.underline}---cooperates with everyone □ [Hollow
square:]{.underline} [the egoist]{.underline}---defects from everyone ▪
[Solid square: the traitor]{.underline}---cooperates with members of
out-groups and defects from the in-group ∘ Hol[low circle: **the
ethnocentric**---cooperates with the in-group and defects from members
of out-groups.]{.underline} The world these agents populate is a 51 x 51
wrap-around grid randomly populated at the outset by these four kinds of
agent groups, each of which occurs as one of four distinct
ethnicities---each represented by an arbitrary color: blue, green,
yellow, and red. Call this starting setup the ecosystem at maximal
entropy. [As one generation advances to the next, clusters of colors
self-organize, and the initial **chaos transforms into undulating
blotches** of color]{.underline} (see figures 1 and 2) (Black and white
versions of figures and colors appear in the print edition of this
article. Color versions appear in the electronic edition). In addition
to the visual depiction of the the evolution of the groups, [the
simulation provides a dynamic graph of the number of individuals of each
kind of agent---of each strategy]{.underline} (not each ethnicity). [The
colors of the lines of the graph denote strategies as
follows]{.underline}: Green ([CC]{.underline}): [the
altruist]{.underline} (solid circle); Black ([DD]{.underline}): [the
egoist]{.underline} (hollow square); Yellow ([DC): the
traitor]{.underline} (solid square[); **Red (CD): the
ethnocentric**]{.underline} (hollow circle) (see figure 3). [At about
100 generations, there are clear clusters of individual
colors]{.underline}, [and the numbers of individuals of each strategy
begin to clearly depart, with the **ethnocentrics**]{.underline} (red
line on graph) **[winning]{.underline}**, the altruists (green line)
second, and the traitors and egoists heading downward. [By the 200th
generation, a clear discrepancy has arisen, with the ethnocentrics the
**clear winner** and the other three together at the bottom]{.underline}
(see figure 4). If [we let this run for two thousand generations, the
differences become only more stark, until the proportions fall into a
dynamic equilibrium, with the ethnocentrics standing at about **75
percent of the total population**]{.underline}. [The
takeaway]{.underline} from Hammond and Axelrod\'s evolution of
ethnocentrisms [is recognition of a very basic force at work in human
decision-making]{.underline} that is working against diversity of
subject matter in the field of philosophy. [Without recourse to normally
expected mechanisms such as reciprocity, reputation, conformity, or
leadership, each agent]{.underline} in the model [acts]{.underline}
individually, and, through interactive group dynamics, [in-group
favoritism]{.underline}---[that is, ethnocentrism---evolves as the
**dominant strategy**]{.underline}. [From the perspective of members of
the in-group, the cooperative behavior on the part of the ethnocentric
appears helpful, even self-sacrificing, and yet the overall effect is
rank balkanization]{.underline}. Even assuming pro-social motives, we
cannot infer a tendency toward an even distribution of goods over time.
[Axelrod and Hammond\'s model]{.underline}, assuming that it provides a
legitimate insight into tendencies in human decision-making, [shows that
there is a built-in drive toward exclusionism]{.underline}.

Although possible, [to expect]{.underline} that [individuals will change
their]{.underline} habits and their expe[riences at the level of
minuscule threads of daily experience and to do so on a large scale is
**unreasonably optimistic.**]{.underline} [There are few incentives to
do so]{.underline}, there are few "manuals" that show the way, [and
there are many daily experiences that oppose change]{.underline}.
Existing [group memberships, such as]{.underline} [**religious,
political, and ethnic identities**, are viewed around the world as
sacred]{.underline} in nature [and where explicit negative attitudes
towards those from another group are common]{.underline}. This being the
case, [it is important to consider the role of mechanisms other than
individuals]{.underline} volunteering to change individual minds. In
many social sciences that are not as focused on the individual as
psychology is, the idea of measuring progress and creating change has
always been considered at the more macro level of groups, institutions,
laws, and governance. As we consider the evidence on implicit cognition,
[it is clear that if individuals are largely unaware of their own mental
states]{.underline} and that their behavior is not in line with their
own intentions and values, [that levers of change other than individual
minds **must be relied upon**]{.underline}. [Institutions in democracies
have the power to shape environments to elicit the attitudes and beliefs
their own citizens aspire to but fall short on]{.underline}.
[Institutions that control]{.underline} housing,
[education]{.underline}, business, healthcare, [and]{.underline} the
[law]{.underline} [can take up the challenge of creating **implicit bias
reducing experiences** that a society willingly acknowledges to be in
the public interest.]{.underline} This becomes a necessity when such an
aspiration is combined with knowledge of the deep bounds of the
rationality of individual decision making. [If a society believes that
all its citizens deserve equal opportunity, then institutions may fill
in the gaps created by the limits of individual
decision-making.]{.underline}

## Hegemonic Stability Theory

### 2AC/1NC -- HST -- Generic

These sorts of trends tend to give U.S. strategists the heebie-jeebies.
[A staple of]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [thinking for]{.underline}
**[decades]{.underline}** [has been that]{.underline} **[U.S. hegemony
is the mainstay of global order]{.underline}**. According to this
\"theory of hegemonic stability,\" [peace and prosperity]{.underline}
are [only]{.underline} likely [to persist when]{.underline} **[a liberal
superpower]{.underline}** [is prepared to act to keep]{.underline}
[**markets open** and **stamp out brewing conflict**]{.underline}. If
Mead or Robert Kagan are correct, then a United States that is both
unwilling and unable to stabilize the rest of the world really should be
a source of concern. Here\'s the thing, though: at the same time that
commentators were bemoaning U.S. decline, the world was looking up. I
suspect that [ThinkProgress and Britain\'s]{.underline} Spectator
[magazine]{.underline} would agree on very little in politics, but this
month they both [ran features pointing out]{.underline} [something
important]{.underline}: **[2013 was \"the best year in human
history.\"]{.underline}** [Their data is
**incontrovertible**]{.underline}. [If you look at human
development]{.underline} [indicators]{.underline}, **[all]{.underline}**
of the **[key metrics]{.underline}** \-- [infant mortality]{.underline},
infectious [diseases]{.underline}, [per capital income]{.underline} \--
[are **trending in the right direction**]{.underline}. By the end of
2013, [the smallest fraction]{.underline} of the world\'s population
[will be living in poverty]{.underline}. **[Both traditional and human
security measures]{.underline}** **[reveal the same
trend]{.underline}**. [Whether it\'s **violent crime**]{.underline},
**[discrimination]{.underline}**, **[civil or interstate
war]{.underline}**, **[the aggregate data shows a more peaceable
world]{.underline}**. Or, as the Spectator put it: \"Every day in every
way, the world grows richer, safer and smarter.\" If you don\'t believe
political partisans, then buy Angus Deaton\'s The Great Escape and
you\'ll discover the same message. [Despite the post-2008 trend
of]{.underline} [predicting that the global order is
crumbling]{.underline} and the world is going to hell, **[the opposite
is transpiring]{.underline}**. How and why can this be happening when
American power is on the wane? Those fearful of disorder have made two
fundamental errors in judgment. First, they assume that China, Iran, and
others want to rewrite the global rules of the game. Not so. To be sure,
these countries want to preserve their sovereignty and expand their
sphere of influence \-- and on these issues, they will clash with the
United States. On the other hand, contra Mead, they will also clash with
each other as well. Furthermore, Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran very much
want to participate in the global economy. Indeed, the reason Rouhani is
trying to negotiate a nuclear deal is to get Iran out from under the
dead weight of crippling economic sanctions. And contra what everyone
expected in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, emerging markets are
not eager to topple the existing global order. Indeed, the recent trade
deal in Bali suggests that, if anything, they want to reinforce the
existing rules of the game. The bigger error, however, has come from
analysts confusing a U.S. reluctance to use military force in the Middle
East with a decline in American power and influence. The truth is that
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [still
wields considerable power]{.underline}, **[which is]{.underline}** one
**[reason why 2013 turned out to be such a good year.]{.underline}**
Whether one looks at global capital flows or the use of the dollar as a

[has]{.underline} also [helped to **tamp down conflict**]{.underline}
[in the]{.underline} [Central African Republic]{.underline}, [as well as

political dysfunction, one can only imagine what America\'s rivals must
think. In 2013 alone, the federal government couldn\'t evade a stupid,
counterproductive budget sequester, a government shutdown, and
brinksmanship with the debt ceiling. There was no agreement on
immigration reform, much less on policies such as climate change,
education, or infrastructure. [Despite mounting gridlock and policy own
goals]{.underline}, however, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [ends 2013 with a rapidly declining]{.underline}
federal budget [deficit, a]{.underline} [surging energy sector, and
accelerating growth]{.underline} in the economy [and

2014 could be a breakthrough year for the United States. [The most

[can\'t **displace** **the**]{.underline} **[structural strengths of the

[The spread of liberal democracy and economic liberalism]{.underline} in
the postwar era [has created unprecedented amounts of wealth and lifted
more people out of poverty than any other political or economic
system]{.underline}. Although income is still very unevenly distributed
(in some countries more so than in the past), [more people enjoy a
higher standard of living than during any other era.]{.underline} As a
way of organizing relations within and between societies, [the American
model of strong market freedoms backed by robust institutions is largely
responsible for generating the tremendous growth in GDP]{.underline},
[trade]{.underline}, [and cross-border securities]{.underline} that the
world has witnessed in the last sixty-five years. At the domestic level,
[a market-based economy protects private ownership]{.underline},
[determines resource-use through the price mechanism]{.underline} [and
puts in place credit institutions so that income can grow beyond the
underlying resource base.]{.underline} Safeguarding [political
freedoms,]{.underline} primarily through free and general elections, is
not only a good in itself but should, in theory, [limit the ability of
elected officials]{.underline} [to use]{.underline} their [political
power to manipulate market outcomes for private gain]{.underline}. In
practice, political freedoms have been less widely accepted than market
freedoms, in part because the United States has historically been less
effective in promoting political reform than market reform. In addition,
the prospect of being thrown out of office has not always deterred
politicians from abusing their position, especially -- but not
exclusively -- in developing countries. The [unequal distribution of
resources and wealth]{.underline} within societies [is in large part due
to the failure to promote political and economic freedoms in equal
measure and to prevent agents higher up in the hierarchy from using
their power for economic gain]{.underline}. Internationally,
[institutions such as the World Trade Organization, the IMF, the World
Bank, and more]{.underline} informal arrangements [such as the
G-]{.underline}7-plus meetings **[have encouraged the free flow of
goods, services, and capital across countries]{.underline}**. As one
would expect, states at the top of the international power ladder have
been more successful in pursuing their economic interests than less
powerful states. As the single largest producer, trader, and financial
power, [the United States has commanded the greatest
authority]{.underline} in the economic field and consequently been in a
good position to further its economic interests. [In the security field,
the United States has been the most powerful state for most of the
postwar era,]{.underline} and when it shared superpower status with the
Soviet Union during the Cold War, it had even more leverage over those
who scoffed at the barter terms available with the Soviet Union. [The
United States has]{.underline}, [through its military and naval
presence]{.underline} in different parts of the world, [helped safeguard
economic activity in areas where property rights are weak]{.underline}
and guaranteed the free flow of goods at sea. Since enforcing the right
to ownership is a prerequisite for efficient production and enforcing
the right to safe passage is necessary for exchange[, all states with a
stake in the functioning of the current economic order are well served
by the United States' self-appointed role as global
policeman]{.underline}. However, an examination of cases where the
United States has rolled out its military and naval machinery,
unsurprisingly reveals that the primary consideration has been the
protection of American business and political interests.

### 2AC/1NC -- Heg Good -- Generic

#### Hegemony is good -- promotes global prosperity 

**Bil 06** (Max, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations,
\"Power for Good\", The Weekly Standard. 10 April. Vol. 11, Issue 28,
Factiva)//snitty

His case for labeling the United States a global government, rather than
a global empire. rests on a rickety foundation.
[traditionally,]{.underline}\" he notes, \"the [imperial power has been
seen as a predator]{.underline}, drawing economic profit and political
gain from its control of the imperial possession, [while the members of
the society it controls suffer.\"]{.underline} [The United
States]{.underline}, he correctly notes. [does not exploit any states in
this way]{.underline}. [Instead, it provides the whole world with
valuable \"public goods\"-]{.underline} [principally protection from
predators\--that are welcomed by most of the world\'s
states]{.underline}. But that hardly makes it that different from the
British Empire, which also performed all sorts of public services, such
as stamping out the slave trade and piracy. Mandelbaum may see the
United States as a particularly benign great power. and he is not wrong
to do so; but most empires of the past also saw themselves as advancing
a mission civilisatrice. His assurance that the United States means
it\--honestly!\--is not likely to mollify America\'s critics. Nor is his
choice of terminology particularly reassuring. I can\'t see some
mandarin at the Quai d\'Orsay (the French foreign ministry) slapping
himself on the forehead and exclaiming, \"So they are not an empire
after all. They\'re only the world\'s government. What a relief. Vive
les Etats-Unis!\" The value of The Case for Goliath does not lie in its
central conceit\--the ..\--the United States as the world\'s
government\--but in the arguments Mandelbaum advances for why [American
power serves the interests of other countries]{.underline}. The case he
makes is not particularly novel (William Odom and Robert Dujarric made
similar points in their 2004 book, America\'s Inadvertent Empire), but
it bears repeating at a time when the publishing industry is churning
out reams of paranoid tomes with titles like Rogue Nation, The Sorrows
of Empire, and The New American Militarism. [Mandelbaum begins by
listing five security benefits the United States offers the
world]{.underline}. [First, the continuing deployment of American troops
in Europe is a reassurance that \"no sudden shifts in Europe\'s security
arrangements would occur.]{.underline}\" [Second, the United States has
\"reduced the demand for nuclear weapons]{.underline}. and the number of
nuclear-armed countries, to levels considerably below what they
otherwise have reached,\" both by attempting to stop rogue states from
acquiring nukes and by providing nuclear protection to countries such as
Japan(South Korea. and Taiwan that would otherwise go nuclear. [Third,
the United States has fought terrorists across the world]{.underline}
and waged preventive war in Iraq to remove the threat posed by Saddam
Hussein. [Fourth, the United States has undertaken humanitarian
interventions]{.underline} in such places as Bosnia and Kosovo, which
Mandelbaum likens to the \"practice. increasingly common in Western
countries, of removing children from the custody of parents who are
abusing them.\" [Fifth. the United States has attempted to create \"the
apparatus of a working, effective, decent government\" in such
dysfunctional places]{.underline} as Haiti and Afghanistan. Mandelbaum
also points to five economic benefits of American power. First, the
United States provides the security essential for international commerce
by. for instance, policing Atlantic and Pacific shipping lanes. Second,
the United States safeguards the extraction and export of Middle Eastern
oil, the lifeblood of the global economy. Third, in the monetary realm,
the United States has made the dollar \"the world\'s \'reserve\'
currency\" and supplied loans to \"governments in the throes of currency
crises.\" Fourth, the United States has pushed for the expansion of
international trade by midwifing the World Trade Organization, the North
American Free Trade Agreement. and other instruments of liberalization.
And fifth, by providing a ready market for goods exported by such
countries as China and Japan. the United States \"became the
indispensable supplier of demand to the world.\" Naturally. the United
States gets scant thanks for all these services provided gratis. But
Mandelbaum points out that for all their griping, other countries have
not pooled \"their resources to confront the enormous power of the
United States because, [unlike the supremely powerful countries of the
past. the United States \[does\] not threaten them.\" Instead. the
United States actually helps other nations achieve shared
goals]{.underline} such as democracy. peace. and prosperity.

### 2AC/1NC -- Heg Good -- Asia

#### US hegemonic presence in Northeast Asia is crucial to maintaining balance in the region

**Liu, PhD, and Hung, PhD, 11**

(Tony Tai-Ting, Ph.D. International Politics, National Chung Hsing
University, and Ming-Te, Graduate Institute of International Politics,
National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan. \"Hegemonic Stability and
Northeast Asia: What Hegemon? What Stability?.\" Journal of Asia Pacific
Studies 2.2 (2011).)//bc

Regarding the issue of stable order in Northeast Asia, a simple
definition of stability should be provided. Instability in Northeast
Asia revolves around five hot points, namely North Korea's nuclear
development, inter-Korean relations, Cross-Strait relations and
Sino-Japanese relations, with Sino-US relations as the main undercurrent
of regional order[. With the US holding on to vested interest
in]{.underline} [Northeast Asia, **the region continues to be under the
shadow of historical tensions**]{.underline} two decades after the end
of the Cold War. **[A short review reveals that the US continues to have
an important balancing role in the region.]{.underline}** US and
Regional Security in Northeast Asia US strategy in Asia is summarized by
former Secretary of State James Baker (1991) as the "fan out" strategy,
describing the bilateral nature of US foreign relations with friendly
states in the region such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, as opposed
to the group nature of the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO). [With troops
stationed in Japan and South Korea]{.underline}, **[the US continues to
have a strong military presence in Northeast Asia]{.underline}**. It is
often forgotten with time passing that [the original intent of the
alliances is to provide military support to allies that are under the
immediate threat of communism.]{.underline} [With authoritarian regimes
remaining intact]{.underline} in China and North Korea, [US presence
remains in Northeast Asia,]{.underline} calling forth images of Cold War
Asia. As recent as 2000, [China's military demonstration]{.underline} in
response to provocations of independence across the Taiwan Strait [has
garnered heavy attention from the US. The Cheonan ship sinking
incident]{.underline} in the Yellow Sea (2010) [and rumours of
leadership change]{.underline} in North Korea [has the US
on]{.underline} [watch over developments in the region]{.underline}.1 It
**[is clear that the US has a strong interest of maintaining order in
Northeast Asia]{.underline}**. As long as regional conflicts remain
unsolved and worries over China's rise continue to dominate policy
discussions, US regional presence would remain. From the angle of US
allies, **[US military presence]{.underline}** as a result of its
regional strategy [provides the public good of support against
authoritarian regimes]{.underline} [such as China and North
Korea.]{.underline} Regardless of historical antagonisms between Korea
and Japan, [both states would be greatly affected by sudden change in US
strategy]{.underline}, causing both states to reluctantly agree to the
lowest common denominator of US presence. [Rising tensions in the
region]{.underline} often [generate the tightening of military
relations]{.underline} [between US-ROK and US-Japan,]{.underline}
evident in the revision of the US-Japan security treaty after China's
missile demonstration in 1996 and the US-ROK joint condemnation of North
Korea in the immediate aftermath of the Cheonan incident. Meanwhile,
[military sales to Taiwan]{.underline} [have continued in light of
improving relations across the Strait. **In light of the hegemonic
stability theory, the US fulfills two principles**]{.underline}: (1)
regardless of the debate in capabilities, **[the US continues to have
the capability and will to uphold regional security]{.underline}** [and
order in Northeast Asia]{.underline}; (2) **[US military presence
provides a public good for regional allies]{.underline}** **[by
deterring military aggression from China or North Korea.]{.underline}**
China and Regional Order in Northeast Asia Using the five regional hot
points mentioned above as the working definition of stability, [China
seems to agree with its US counterpart on the maintenance of
order]{.underline} in Northeast Asia but the Chinese approach to the
issue is different. Compared to the US, it is important to point out
that [China is an immediate player concerned in changes to bilateral
relations]{.underline} in Northeast Asia, not only [due to its
geographic location but also as an interested party in the
relationship]{.underline}s. Many studies fail to address the obvious
geopolitical factor in China's serious and uncompromising stance
regarding regional security. China's national interest is immediately
threatened by the outbreak of conflicts due to the possibility of
spillover effects and externalities,1 which may potentially initiate the
US alliance system and lead to a spinoff crisis.2 In terms of regional
security[, China has as much interest as the US in maintaining stability
in Northeast Asia,]{.underline} if not greater. Ironically, [China's
authoritarian natur]{.underline}e has [caused the PLA to]{.underline}
[be regarded as a visible threat to regional securit]{.underline}y in
contrast to the paternal image of US military presence. The Tiananmen
incident and successive military gestures regarding succession movements
and territorial issues have deepened the authoritarian image to the
detriment of China's connection with the international community. In
this regard, [China's rising capabilities can only be a challenge to
regional security]{.underline}, a claim paradoxical to China's interest
in maintaining regional order and supportive of claims such as China's
intent to the historical glory of regional hegemony and revise
international order due to discontent of the status quo (Bernstein and
Munro, 1998). In the case of China, [one can wonder what public good the
state can provide in order to apply the hegemonic stability
theory]{.underline}. In light of theory, a controversial case may be
made that [China's internal stability is itself the dominating factor in
regional security and the public good that may be provided to
neighbouring countries]{.underline}. At least one observer has boldly
predicted the collapse of China (Chang, 2001). Power transition
theorists point out that **[a system is most unstable when the
distribution of power changes]{.underline}** but do not state further of
the potential consequences (Lemke and Tammen, 2003; Kugler and Tammen,
2004). Regarding China, the state under close examination, [most threat
theory advocates]{.underline} merely [warn of the danger of China's
collapse and suggest how other states should respond;]{.underline}
rarely do observers suggest how regional security should be maintained
if China should suddenly break up. In other words, most discussions
magnify China's ambition and dwell on the issue of defense against
China, instead of pondering over how China should uphold internal
stability, a task left for the Chinese themselves. As a rising power
with massive population, China threat may come from within rather than
demonstrated without. When discussing hegemony, rarely does the
hegemonic state's capability and stability come into question. At the
intersection of political economy, even as the US is shocked by domestic
economic recession, regional expectations for US military presence
remain stable, especially in Northeast Asia. In contrast, despite great
power potential, China has yet to fully develop into a hegemonic state
as defined by theory and the state's authoritarian nature makes the
regime's future unpredictable in the age of information exchange.
[China's proximity to a region rife with historical, political and
ethnic tensions]{.underline} divert energy away from national
development and [puts the state in a different setting if it is to
strive for hegemonic]{.underline} [status]{.underline}. Geopolitics is
an important consideration in the case of China, a factor not as
prominent in the case of the sea sheltered US.

### 2AC/1NC -- Heg Good -- GPW

#### Decline in hegemony emboldens China and causes status competition --- miscalc, draw-in and GPW

**Heath, 18** - senior international defense researcher at the RAND
Corporation (Timothy, \"The Competition for Status Could Increase the
Risk of a Military Clash in Asia\", Asia Maritime Transparency
Initiative, [February 1,
2018](file:///C:\Users\seamu\Documents\February%201,%202018),
https://amti.csis.org/competition-status-risk-clash-asia/))SK

However, while the salience of conflict for the sake of gaining
territory may be declining, [the importance of status as a **potential
driver of conflict** may be increasing]{.underline}. Status is an
ambiguous and elusive concept, but at its core, [status consists of a
country's **ranking in a hierarchy** within a peer group]{.underline}.
Status can be measured indirectly through estimations of a country's
influence and prestige, as well as its reputation. [Status matters a
great deal because it can confer considerable benefits, as
[studies](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137499578_2)]{.underline}
on the [have shown]{.underline} topic. [Jonathon
[Renshon]{.underline}](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11037.html),
[an expert]{.underline} on the role of status in international
relations, has [described how high-status countries enjoy a]{.underline}
greater degree of [**deference** from other countries and can thus
secure a far larger share of available resources]{.underline} at a far
lower cost than their lower status peers. [Status can only be achieved
through competition]{.underline}, however. [Because]{.underline}
[rankings are inherently **zero sum**]{.underline}, [one country's rise
in status invariably requires the diminishment of its
competitors]{.underline}. [The immense benefits that]{.underline} can
[accompany high status]{.underline} and the competition required to
secure it h[elp explain why status concerns have historically
underpinned many inter-state conflict]{.underline}s. Historically, many
a country has gone to great lengths and sometimes incurred crippling
costs to salvage a faltering status or increase its standing. [In
the]{.underline} 1956 **[Suez Crisis]{.underline}**, for example, [Great
Britain pursued a]{.underline}n unnecessary and [pointless military
attack to stave off]{.underline} a [challenge from Egypt]{.underline} to
its waning status in the Middle East. The ensuing debacle confirmed
Britain's decline as a great power. During the 1960s, [U.S. anxiety
over]{.underline} its [status vis a vis]{.underline} its primary rival,
[the Soviet Union, led]{.underline} Presidents [Kennedy and Johnson to
escalate the country's commitment to a war in **Vietnam**]{.underline}
of dubious prospects, a situation the [Soviet Union]{.underline}
mirrored in its own disaster [in **Afghanistan**]{.underline} in the
1980s. Conversely, the value of an increase in status can be seen in the
aftermath of Japan's stunning defeat of Russia in 1904-5. The outcome
shocked western opinion and earned Japan the status of peer with the
world's leading imperial powers. Tokyo subsequently expanded its control
of Asia. Similarly, [America's victory in the Spanish-American War
confirmed Spain's eclipse as a great power]{.underline} in Latin and
South America. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cemented
its status as the leading nation]{.underline} in the Americas and saw
its influence expand accordingly. As these examples suggest,
[competition for status tends to **recede** when consensus exists among
peer states about **relative rankings**, as happened]{.underline}
briefly [in the largely peaceful]{.underline} and stable [post-Cold War
"unipolar" moment of U.S. global preeminence]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [competition for status]{.underline} also [tends
to increase in periods of uncertainty]{.underline}. Today, persistent
economic stagnation in the developed world and the rise of developing
countries have unsettled existing hierarchies and raised afresh anxiety
over the standing of many great powers. [Fears of diminished standing
can be seen in]{.underline} the immense commentary bemoaning [the
[decline in U.S. and European
influence](http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/62635)]{.underline}
and in the debate over the possibilities of a [post-Western
age](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/world-brink-post-western-age-donald-trump-brexit-europe-us-declines-munich-security-conference-a7580511.html).
Such apprehensions have also featured prominently in U.S. policy
documents. In its recently released [National Security
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf),
U.S. authorities warned that "China and Russia challenge American power,
influence, and interests." These [concerns are particularly acute in
Asia, which has seen an [intensifying strategic
competition](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2119719/wary-china-quad-bloc-watch-after-officials-us-japan)
for status and influence between **China** and]{.underline} its
principal rivals- [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Japan,
and India]{.underline}. [For China, status is increasingly vital to
realizing its **revitalization as a great power**.]{.underline} To
sustain growth, [China seeks to deepen]{.underline} Asia's integration
through [the]{.underline} [[B]{.underline}elt and [R]{.underline}oad
[I]{.underline}nitiative](http://english.gov.cn/beltAndRoad/) [and shape
the terms of regional trade]{.underline}. [China also seeks to construct
a [regional security
architecture](http://english.gov.cn/archive/white_paper/2017/01/11/content_281475539078636.htm)]{.underline}
defined by Chinese-led organizations such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building.
With adequate status, China could gain the deference and cooperation
from regional powers needed to control potential flashpoints, improve
its security, and secure preferential access to resources and markets at
a fraction of the cost in resources than would be required if it had to
fight and negotiate its way through every issue. [Recognizing the
importance]{.underline} of the issue, [the]{.underline} [19th
**[C]{.underline}**hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty Congress
report](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/19thcpcnationalcongress/2017-11/04/content_34115212.htm)
[outlined]{.underline} as [a **long term goal** the ambition to "become
a **global leader**"]{.underline} in "international influence."
Similarly, [Chinese leaders have stepped up efforts to [strengthen the
country's leadership
position](https://jamestown.org/program/diplomacy-work-forum-xi-steps-up-efforts-to-shape-a-china-centered-regional-order/)]{.underline}
in the region. China for now has relied on peaceful, albeit intrusive,
measures to increase its influence and bolster its standing, such
sustained military modernization, massive economic diplomacy
initiatives, [United Front
tactics](https://www.thechinastory.org/yearbooks/yearbook-2015/forum-ascent/the-expansion-of-the-united-front-under-xi-jinping/)
and the manipulation of diplomatic carrots and sticks. Some observers
have seen evidence of China's increasing influence in the Philippines'
and South Korea's growing sensitivity to Chinese concerns. But the
effectiveness of incremental, peaceful methods is difficult to prove
because their effects are harder to perceive. Some commentators, for
example, [regard Chinese gains in influence as
limited](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/opinion/chinas-limited-influence.html).
Moreover, peaceful, incremental efforts are also vulnerable to
counter-measures. Already, a growing array of [countries have begun to
raise concern about Chinese [**economic
coercion**](http://carnegieendowment.org/2017/07/25/is-coercion-new-normal-in-china-s-economic-statecraft-pub-72632)
and influence operations.]{.underline} [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} its [allies]{.underline} and
partners [rightfully seek to protect their interests by bolstering their
respective positions]{.underline}, even as they continue to cooperate
with China. The strategy may succeed, but at its core is the assumption
that stability can best be gained if China continues to acquiesce to the
international order as established after World War II by the United
States and its allies. [China's conviction that its security **depends
on changes to this order** sets up a]{.underline} deep, [**structural
contradiction** that is unlikely to be resolved]{.underline} any time
soon. Beijing can accordingly be expected to persist in peaceful methods
to supplant the United States as Asia's leader. [If]{.underline},
however, [Beijing at some point concludes that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} its
[allies have successfully **stymied its aspirations**, China may be
tempted by **riskier methods** to assert its status]{.underline}. [A
precedent for such behavior may be seen in a rising Germany of the
1890s-1900s]{.underline}. Convinced that it had been denied a status
befitting its national power by Britain and France, Germany provoked a
series of militarized crises around the world. In 1906, Germany
threatened war against France after the two feuded about influence over
Morocco. And in a second Moroccan crisis five years later, Germany
extracted colonial concessions after it deployed a gunboat in response
to a French military intervention. [In China's case, brinksmanship
behavior could be carried out in the contested East or
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**eas
[with military ships and aircraft]{.underline}. Already, a growing
literature by [Chinese military writers recommend]{.underline}s the
[[skillful **exploitation** of military
crises](https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CT470.html) for strategic
gain]{.underline}. [**Brinksmanship** carries]{.underline} its own
[risks,]{.underline} of course. [**Miscalculation** could lead to
unwanted war]{.underline}. The [strategic effects could be
severe]{.underline} as well. [Rivals]{.underline} like the United
States, Japan, and India [could be alarmed enough by a clash that they
step up military preparations, aggravating China's security
situatio]{.underline}n. Moreover, conflict could imperil China's grand
Belt and Road Initiative ambition, if aggrieved neighbors opt out and
welcome investments by Japan and India instead. China has many good
reasons to never consider military provocations against a neighbor. But
[Beijing]{.underline} also [has compelling reasons to increase the
country's standing and diminish that of the United States and its
allies]{.underline}. Given that the ruling Chinese Communist Party has
staked its reputation towards that end, China's leaders should be
expected to consider all available options to achieve it.

### 2NC/2AC -- AT: Thayer

#### Thayer is wrong -- evolutionary biology's relation to realism is premised on false notions of warfare and warrantless

political scientist best known for his work in international relations,

Macmillan UK // NC)

**[Thayer's thesis is flawed at every stage of its
construction]{.underline}**. [It rests on the assumption that offensive
realism is an accurate depiction of international relations rather than
an ideology **without much empirical support.** The same might be said
for hegemonic stability theory,]{.underline} a justification for the
American imperial project that is empirically problematic. [Thayer
insists that these approaches to international relations are successful
because they build on correct assumptions about human
nature]{.underline}. [There is no discussion whatsoever of efforts to
reduce war and ethnic conflict through conflict resolution, institution
building, development and humanitarian intervention]{.underline}. They
are presumably in conflict with our nature and doomed to failure.
[Thayer's arbitrary choice of what is human and what is not **is offered
without any evidence**, as is his claim that war as the most important
of all human activities affecting evolution]{.underline}. **[We are
given no mechanisms that would account for the increase in brain
capacity warfare that is said to stimulate.]{.underline}** Successful
warriors are assumed to breed more successfully, another claim
unsupported by evidence. We must assume that group advantages, conferred
by individual characteristics such as aggression, bravery and loyalty,
are somehow passed on through warrior genes and that natural selection
does this rest. At the outset, Thayer claims that his approach is both
scientific and readily falsifiable. I think we must accept the latter
claim. [A final word about warfare.]{.underline} [Thayer barrages us

The latest entry in the field is Jonathan Haidt's The Righteous Mind. It
is written for a general, not academic audience, and develops elaborate
arguments to demonstrate the superiority of conservative moral systems.
It has a favorable puff from E.O. Wilson and a tasteless cover design of
a hand giving the finger, presumably to liberals. [Haidt maintains moral
dispositions are inherited and that group selection is a powerful
evolutionary mechanism that is responsible for moral
disposition]{.underline}s. In effect[, social and biological evolution
is self-reinforcin]{.underline}g. All societies, he insists, are held
together by moral codes based on emotions. Haidt identifies six kinds of
moral responses, which he compares with taste receptors. Like different
cuisines, different moralities make use of combinations of them. Each
response is framed as a positive and negative binary. They are
care/harm, liberty/oppression, fairness/ cheating, loyalty/betrayal,
authority/subversion and sanctity/degradation. In their positive valence
-- the first term of every pair -- they shape self-interest in a way to
enhance cooperation among people not closely related by blood. Reason
plays only a minor role: it provides rationalizations for behavior
dictated by emotions. Indeed, the moral foundations of society were
organized 'in advance of experience' (Haidt, 2012, p.131). [Haidt uses
this elaborate superstructure to critique liberal conceptions of
morality]{.underline}. [They build on a limited range of emotional
values and rely too heavily on reason]{.underline}. Conservatives'
moralities are superior because they incorporate all six emotional
values and relegate reason to a minor role. [Science can thus explain
why conservative political and religious groups have been so successful
in recent decades]{.underline} -- **[itself a questionable
statement]{.underline}**. These groups and movements emphasize loyalty,
authority and sanctity, values particularly effective in constructing
cohesion and preventing anomie, but largely anathema to liberals because
they restrict autonomy and individuality. Conservatives also allegedly
benefit from their emphasis on fairness, in contrast to the liberal
concern for equality. The former, but not the latter, builds on basic
moral instincts. [**Haidt's social observations are presented as if they
are the objective result of his research**. This research consists of
surveys and interviews he and others have carried ou]{.underline}t, [and
references to work in anthropology, animal behavior and
neuroscience]{.underline} when it can be interpreted to support his
claims. Mostly[, he offers stories and vignettes as
evidence]{.underline}. A case in point is the interviews of combat
veterans by historian William McNeil to ascertain why they fought. From
them [Haidt]{.underline} (2012, p.123) [infers that human beings are
'conditional hive creatures']{.underline}, and when triggered
appropriately act altruistically. Additional evidence is allegedly
provided by the desire of so many Americans to help survivors of the
terrorist attacks of 9/11. He attributes altruism of this sort to
group-related evolutionary adaptation. [Haidt]{.underline}, and some of
the authors he is fond of citing, [draw unwarranted inferences from
their research]{.underline}. Take his claim that people make moral
judgments 'immediately and emotionally', and that as Hume supposes,
'Reasoning is merely the servant of the passions' (Haidt, 2012, p.40).
[Part of the evidence for these claims comes from a study Haidt
conducted that elicited moral judgments from participants about diverse
behaviors.]{.underline} [The so-called evidence appears to be an
artifact of the experiment that **prejudged the results by requiring
people to make rapid responses**]{.underline}. His [denigration of
reason goes far beyond his finding that people offer rationalizations
for emotional responses to moral issues]{.underline}, let alone his
claim that moral responses are intuitive. An alternative explanation
would be that participant responses reflect socialization. Elsewhere,
[Haidt offers evidence to this effect]{.underline}, [citing surveys of
Americans and Indians and differences in what they find morally
acceptable and objectionable]{.underline}. **[This diversity should
raise doubts about the biological and intuitive nature of moral
feelings]{.underline}**. As ethical practices show enormous cultural
variation, this suggests that [any number of ethical codes are
functional. If so, natural selection would not function to eliminate
some and spread others]{.underline}. Haidt insists that moral codes
reflect biological and social conditioning. But he insists that behavior
can have biological consequences. As an example, he cites the spread of
the gene that made people able to digest milk products in the years
after being weaned. Lactose tolerance undoubtedly conferred a survival
advantage, but there is no evidence that human behavior had anything to
do with the emergence, as opposed to the spread, of the gene. His
broader argument rests on the mechanism of group selection. [When groups
compet]{.underline}e, '[the cohesive, cooperative group usually
wins']{.underline} (Haidt, 2012, p.193). [Natural selection rewards such
groups, as they are more likely survive and reproduce than their less
cohesive competitors]{.underline}. To do this, [natural selection must
work at the genetic level to spread the genes that made individuals more
cooperative within successful groups. It also requires]{.underline}, as
Haidt acknowledges, [a genetic basis for such feelings of sanctity and
loyalty]{.underline} -- the values that are supposed to enhance group
effectiveness. Moreover, [individuals who lack these qualities within
successful groups must be less likely to survive and reproduce than
those who possess them]{.underline}. **[These are very dubious
biological and social assumptions]{.underline}**. **[There is no easy
way to test for the selection of complex skills]{.underline}**, as we
cannot control for the effects of socialization. [Ashkenazi
Jews]{.underline}, for example, [are]{.underline} greatly
[overrepresented among the world's most successful and prominent
violinists,]{.underline} cellists and pianists. **[Does this reflect a
genetic advantage]{.underline}**, or have Jewish families and culture
encouraged an interest in music and nurtured whatever talent appeared?
**[There is never a one-to-one relationship between a gene and a
behavior]{.underline}**. Most [traits are not the result of single
genes]{.underline}, **[but combinations of them and complex patterns of
their activation]{.underline}**. [This is even more likely to be true of
any social orientations that are found to be hereditary.]{.underline} If
so, beneficial social traits may require environmental triggers, or may
appear, at least statistically, as part of a suite of traits, only some
of which may be beneficial. [The evolutionary picture far more complex
and less linear than Haidt acknowledges]{.underline}. It [may be
--]{.underline} and my reading of history and sociology suggests it is
the case -- [that groups and societies benefit from a diverse set of
skills and orientations]{.underline}, not the narrow palette that Haidt,
or anyone else, emphasizes. Haidt insists that whatever traits make a
group more efficient at procuring food make it more fit and likely to
survive. As noted, he attributes this advantage to a single social
variable: group cohesion. It is conventional wisdom that [sedentary
agriculturalists triumphed over nomads because they had access to more
calories.]{.underline} I am at a loss to attribute this development to
group cohesion, which was presumably an equally valuable asset in both
kinds of societies. History is more complex than Haidt acknowledges.
**[Haidt's invocation of natural selection within societies is as
questionable as his application of it across them]{.underline}**. He
maintains that in the ancient world the brave and loyal were more likely
to make it home from war than loners, cowards and those who avoided
military service. He further insists that women were more likely to
choose the former for mates. [No evidence is offered for these
assertions, and it is easy to construct counter narratives.]{.underline}
**[Haidt's approach to social selection is embarrassingly simplistic in
conception]{.underline}**, at odds with current understandings of
genetics and historically and sociologically uninformed. Most
importantly, **[it rests on a set of arbitrary, self-serving assumptions
that he uses to pass off snake oil as science.]{.underline}**

### Evolution =/= IR

#### *[Unique networks]{.underline}* mean natural selection theories can't be applied to international relations

Is natural selection an appropriate mechanism in politics? Kenneth Waltz
thinks so and makes it central to his theory of international politics.
He is clear that the international system selects for certain kinds of
behavior: that which copes most effectively with anarchy and the threats
to survival associated with it. Over time, units become more alike, and
this allows him to ignore state-level variation and construct a theory
entirely at the system level. Waltz does not draw directly on evolution,
but on microeconomics, where the theory of the firm is explicitly
Darwinian in conception. [**Natural selection does not work in
international relations**.]{.underline} If [a giraffe with a long neck
can reach more leaves]{.underline}, it is more likely to survive and
reproduce. Over multiple generations, the statistical average of giraffe
neck lengths will increase -- but not beyond the point where it is no
longer functional. [Unlike necks, **political skill is not
inherited.**]{.underline} [Skillful leaders do not produce more
offspring than their unsuccessful counterparts]{.underline}, nor are
they followed in office by equally qualified successors. Frederick the
Great transformed Prussia from a backwater march into a great power. His
descendants recklessly challenged Napoleonic France and in 1806 lost
most of the territory he had gained. Hardenberg, Gneisenau and
Scharnhorst reorganized the Prussian state and army, regaining their
country's status as a great power. Bismarck built on this foundation,
unified Germany and made it the dominant power in Europe. Wilhelm II and
his advisors gambled recklessly and needlessly on victory in a European
war, which led to Germany's defeat, partial dismemberment, costly
reparations and restrictions on rearmament, and the size of its armed
forces. Gustav Stresemann made gradual but notable progress in
reintegrating Germany into the European political community. Hitler led
Germany into an even more destructive war that left the country smaller
in size and divided into two ideologically opposed, quasi-independent,
rump states. Over the course of the next half-century, the leaders of
the German Federal Republic pursued cautious policies that gained
independence, respect and trust for their country, and ultimately
reunification. Germany's seesawing is more typical of international
relations than the kind of development associated with evolution.
[Natural selection is inappropriate to the study of international
relations for a second important reason]{.underline}: [it **does not
cull the herd of actors who are weak, old or otherwise unable to
compete**]{.underline}. The total number of states in the world shrank
in the nineteenth century because of Napoleon's consolidation of the
Holy Roman Empire, German and Italian unification, and colonial
expansion. In the twentieth century, it has increased from 57 in 1900 to
193, not counting Taiwan.3 Even in Europe, it has grown from 32 in 1945
to 43 today. [As some astute observers of the contemporary scene have
noted, the **international system is ordered in such a way to keep
failed states alive**, **with consequences not always beneficial for
their inhabitants**]{.underline} (Rotberg, 2004).

## Status Competition

### Status Competition Wrong

#### 'Status competition' is flawed --- their authors are [totalizing]{.underline} 

**Volgy and Gordell, 19** (Thomas J. Volgy: Professor of Political
Science. Kelly Marie Gordell: doctorate candidate at the school of
Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona. \"Rising
powers, status competition, and global governance: a closer look at
three contested concepts for analyzing status dynamics in international
politics\", Contemporary Politics, June 3, 2019, pg. 9))SK

However, [we raise five warnings about how scholars address status
seeking and status competition]{.underline}. First, we suggest that [it
is dangerous to conflate competition and conflict between states as
driven **exclusively**]{.underline} or primarily **[by status
considerations]{.underline}**. Policy makers' [desires to
maintain]{.underline} or enhance their [status may be]{.underline} a
'[fundamental]{.underline} state motivation' (Duque, 2018, p. 1[) but
status concerns]{.underline} likely [constitute a **variable condition**
rather than a constant state of affairs]{.underline} for most states. If
so, then [we need to specify conditions under which policy makers are
motivated to engage]{.underline} in international politics [as a
function of their need for]{.underline} greater [status]{.underline},
[or from a fear of being unable to maintain]{.underline} the
[status]{.underline} they have.8 [It is a distorting academic exercise
to assume]{.underline} that almost [all]{.underline} foreign policy
[activity is motivated by status considerations, any more than solely by
security concerns or domestic political advantages]{.underline}.
[Sometimes the desire to acquire a naval carrier is based on **perceived
security needs rather than**]{.underline} the need [**to acquire a
'status toy**.']{.underline} Second, [we do not believe that the pursuit
of greater status]{.underline}, or the need to maintain extant status,
[should automatically equate to status competition and conflict between
states]{.underline}. In fact, the [conditions and
constraints]{.underline} involved for states potentially engaging in
status-seeking policies [are]{.underline} [complex]{.underline} (as
suggested in Figure 9), [and do not automatically lead to extensive
competition]{.underline} or conflict. As we had noted earlier,
status-seeking strategies may depend in substantial part on where states
are positioned (e.g. Roren & Beaumont, 2018), and the extent of their
dissatisfaction with their positioning. [States on a]{.underline} strong
[upward]{.underline} status [trajectory (e.g. **China**) are likely
to]{.underline} behave differently, and likely [to take **fewer
risks**]{.underline} than states in danger of losing their status, as
their status is declining in the group hierarchy, or if they may be in
danger altogether of falling out of the status club (Russia).

### AT: Status Symbols

#### IR status competition *[presupposes]{.underline}* hegemony is contingent on status markers, rather *[temporal comparisons]{.underline}* are necessary to understand the actions of great powers 

**Freedman, PhD,** 8-26-20**15**

(Joshua Freedman is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Politics at
Oberlin College (starting fall 2019), where he teaches courses on global
politics, international law, international security, and the
Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. Freedman earned a Ph.D. (June 2019) from

[The act of recognition in IR is too often defined as a transaction
between established and aspiring actors, which presupposes that actors
always know what status recognition entails but simply disagree on
whether the state in question deserves recognition]{.underline}.
[Successful transactions, however, **depend on both the will and the
capacity of negotiating actors**]{.underline}. [It is not sufficient for
the US to merely]{.underline} be willing [to recognize China as a great
power]{.underline} if both states hold mutually inconsistent views on
the signals that are believed to constitute this act[. Understanding how
these inconsistencies arise, and how they can be mitigated]{.underline},
[should be of interest to IR]{.underline} scholars studying status, and
[yet these issues are rarely explored precisely because the desire for
status recognition is always assumed to originate within a social
comparison logic]{.underline}. [China's status concerns]{.underline}, it
is argued, [challenge this logic by elevating Taiwan as a critical
marker of the country's great power status]{.underline}. **[We cannot
understand this move without first understanding the impact of negative
temporal comparisons on status concerns]{.underline}**. Moreover, just
as temporal comparisons are a common form of self-evaluation for
individuals, a temporal theory of status in world politics is not unique
to China. Rather, the universe of cases that benefit from this approach
encompass any state or political community that has suffered a major
instance of status loss in its history. [Much can still be learned by
applying this temporal approach to these cases. Indeed, part of the task
going forward should be to **ferret out other country
cases**]{.underline}, whether they be contemporary or historical, where
temporal comparisons have had, or are having, significant implications
for status recognition. In addition to these positive cases, the
possibility of negative cases30 presents its own interesting challenges.
These would be cases where unfavorable temporal comparisons exist in the
context of status loss but are not frequently invoked and produce no
observable consequences. Just as we should be interested in why states
may privilege social over temporal comparisons (or vice versa) when
evaluating status, we should be equally interested in how states can
seemingly overcome and ignore unfavorable comparisons in one realm for
favorable comparisons in the other. The temporal theory of status in
world politics outlined in this article complicates the policy
recommendations put forward by the status incentives literature
precisely because the past, as a status metric, is elusive. If Beijing's
concept of status recognition is temporally contingent, the bar can
always move higher. After Taiwan, Outer Mongolia?31 The risk, then, for
the status incentives literature is that established great powers may
recognize rising powers, using the signals and practices that they see
fit, and find that recipient actors still feel unrecognized and so
behave as actors struggling for recognition.

### AT: Western Studies

#### Western studies are limited to *[western culture]{.underline}* specifically -- it can't accurately explain eastern competitiveness

[The research we draw on to build **the present framework principally
used participants from Western**,]{.underline} more individualistic
**[cultures, raising the possibility that this framework is culture
specific and may not apply to Eastern cultures]{.underline}** that
construe the self as part of a larger network (Markus & Kitayama, 1991).
We think it plausible, however, that [some dynamics underlying
competitiveness may be common across cultures]{.underline} (Tang, 1999;
Toda, Shinotsuka, McClintock, & Stech, 1978), though both the base rates
of social comparison and competitiveness and the impact of certain
variables we identify may be culture dependent (A. P. Buunk, Carmona,
Peiró, Dijkstra, & Dijkstra, 2011). [For example, Chinese precollege
students use competitive strategies, whereas American precollege
students use cooperative strategies in the realm of test
taking]{.underline} (Tang, 1999). Yet this difference is not cultural
per se, rather resulting from different institutional structures of
testing: college entrance exams are a onetime event in 10 Garcia et al.
China but repeatable in the United States. Accordingly, a study
comparing the strategies used by students in the two cultures found that
the psychological predictors of "competitive types" and "cooperative
types" did not vary by culture or origin (Tang, 1999). [The same may
hold for the impact of individual and situational factors, which can
remain influential despite significant differences in their concrete
cross-cultural manifestations]{.underline}. To illustrate, a common
Japanese maxim states that "the nail that sticks out gets hammered,"
suggesting it may be more important for Japanese relative to American
populations to avoid falling behind the competition than to break ahead
of the competition. Indeed, findings indicate that the Japanese may be
slightly more motivated than Americans by being ranked near the bottom,
whereas Americans may be slightly more motivated near the top rank
(Heine et al., 2001). In this case, therefore, the situational factor of
proximity to a standard matters but manifests differently across
cultures.

### AT: Competition Inevitable

#### **Competitiveness increases when the number of competitors decreases**

One ubiquitous feature of competitions is the number of competitors. Yet
how exactly does our competitiveness change as the number of competitors
changes? Are we more motivated to compete on exams, in a sales office,
or on the treadmill at the gym as the number of competitors decreases?
[Research has showed the number of competitors (N) to be an important
situational factor of social comparison. Previously]{.underline}, a
number of [**studies found that the intensity of competitive behavior
increases as N decreases,** but these studies generally confounded
expected payoff with the number of competitors]{.underline}: as N
decreased, expected value increased. For example, auction bidders have a
greater tendency to exceed their bidding limits when vying against a few
versus many bidders for one object (Ku et al., 2005). [A study of the
game show Weakest Link]{.underline} (Pillutla & Ronson, 2005) [found
that contestants behaved more competitively toward other contestants as
the number of players decreased in subsequent rounds]{.underline}. And
[research on tournaments]{.underline} (Ehrenberg & Bognanno, 1990) has
[found the same pattern]{.underline} (see also Boudreau, Lacetera, &
Lakhani, 2011; Casas-Arce & Martínez-Jerez, 2009). **[However, in all
these settings, the diminished N changes the payoff structure of the
competition]{.underline}** (Vandegrift & Holaday, 2012) and leaves open
the possibility that the increased competitiveness observed is caused by
the higher expected payoffs with decreased Ns---that is, by the
incentive structure of the competition. Research on the N effect (Garcia
& Tor, 2009; Tor & Garcia, 2010), [however, found that comparison
concerns intensify, and **competitiveness increases as the number of
competitors decreases,**]{.underline} **[even when controlling for
overall expected payoffs]{.underline}**. For instance, in an analysis of
SAT data at the state level for all 50 U.S. states, researchers tested
the prediction that the lower the average number of test takers per
venue in a state, the higher that state's average SAT score. By dividing
the total number of test takers per state by the total number of
test-taking opportunities in that state, a "test-taking density"
variable was created. As predicted, when controlling for various
demographic factors, a significant inverse relationship between
test-taking density and state-level average SAT scores emerged (Garcia &
Tor, 2009). [To examine the N effect in a controlled setting, one study
recruited undergraduates to complete a short, easy quiz in an aggregated
pool of 10 or 100 competitors]{.underline}, with a monetary incentive
for speed without compromising accuracy (Garcia & Tor, 2009). [As
predicted, participants finished]{.underline} the quiz significantly
[faster in the 10-competitors than in the 100-competitors
condition]{.underline}, without a significant difference in accuracy.
One reason for the effect of N on the competitiveness is that comparison
concerns Psychology of Competition 7 decrease with N. Indeed[, people
harbor fewer comparison concerns and lose interest in comparison
information as N increases]{.underline} (Garcia & Tor, 2009; Tor &
Garcia, 2010). [Therefore,]{.underline} notwithstanding the potential
contribution of additional mechanisms (see Mukherjee & Hogarth, 2010;
Tor & Garcia, 2010), [comparison concerns significantly drive the N
effect.]{.underline} Other research findings also suggest that
comparison concerns decrease with N. For example, personalized
comparisons to a specific individual lead to greater increases in the
motivation to compete than do comparisons to people more generally
(Buckingham & Alicke, 2002; W. M. P. Klein, 2003; Locke, 2007). W. M. P.
Klein (2003) found that people behaved more competitively and were less
willing to provide helpful hints on a feedback task when their
performance was compared with a "single other" versus the "average
other." Dubbed the local dominance effect (Zell & Alicke, 2010), this
work likewise describes how local social comparison information is
likely to carry more weight than global comparison information and may
contribute to the stronger social comparison concerns one finds in
smaller-N settings.

[China spends more in absolute dollars on its military than any other
country in the world after the US]{.underline}. Its prolific military
spending, which increased by 170%1 between 2004 and [has been sustained
by an incredible period of economic growth that saw China surpass Japan
as the world's second-largest economy in 2010]{.underline}. While still
far behind the US, China's US\$8.2 trillion gross domestic product
(GDP)2 is well ahead of its other United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
peers: Britain, France, and Russia. In the relative and material terms
of economic strength and military spending,3 [China is the second most
powerful state in the world,4 and yet it has been]{.underline} described
by Larson and Shevchenko (2010) **[as a "status seeker]{.underline}**,"
by Suzuki (2008: 51) as **[a "frustrated great power,"]{.underline}** by
Scobell (2012: 719) as a society **[in dire need of "international
respect]{.underline}**," and by Deng (2008: 8) as "the most
status-conscious country in the world." What accounts for this
disconnect, and what does it mean for thinking about states and
international relations that China has all of this material power and
yet appears to be engaged in a profound struggle for status and great
power recognition? [This article argues that China's status insecurity
results primarily from transaction and signaling problems endemic to the
practice of status recognition in great power politics. As the
sociology, economics, and political science literatures make clear, an
actor's status depends on two conditions: that they can properly signal
their desire for]{.underline} (or right to) [status; and that the rest
of society can properly signal their recognition]{.underline} of this
claim.5 [Signaling problems]{.underline} may arise in both of these
conditions and [are exacerbated]{.underline}, I argue, [by functional
and ontological differences in the way]{.underline} in which
individuals, groups, and, by transposition[, states engage in
self-evaluation]{.underline}. If [for recognition]{.underline} between
two willing parties [to succeed, both actors need to agree on the
signals]{.underline} [that constitute recognition,]{.underline} then it
is imperative that what the aspiring actor holds to be necessary for it
to "arrive" as a great power in the international system is shared by
those granting recognition. Much of the status literature in
International Relations ([IR]{.underline}) [has overlooked this dilemma
by assuming that all states pursue status for similar
reasons]{.underline} by virtue of engaging in similar methods of
self-evaluation. A significant portion of [this literature draws heavily
from]{.underline} social comparison theory [(SCT),]{.underline} and its
observations that individuals judge their worth, and accordingly derive
self-esteem, through comparisons with others (Larson et al., 2014: 17).
[According to this]{.underline} transposed argument[, states become
status seekers because,]{.underline} like individuals and groups,
**[they have an innate desire for favorable social status comparisons
relative to their peers]{.underline}** (Wohlforth, 2009: 35). Thus, the
literature on status in world politics is often framed in the language
of accommodation, and adjustment (Larson et al., 2014: 4[), **which
presupposes that status insecurities develop from lateral social
comparisons and can be resolved through lateral
improvements.**]{.underline} [Yet,]{.underline} while
[individuals]{.underline} engage in self-evaluation and derive
self-esteem through social comparisons with their peers, they also
engage in selfevaluation and derive self-esteem [through temporal
comparisons with their past]{.underline}. Psychology has addressed this
distinction for some time, noting that individuals repeatedly rely on
both social and temporal sources of information when engaging in
selfevaluation. [Applied to IR,]{.underline} temporal comparison theory
([TCT) suggests that status insecurities in the international system may
not be the exclusive province of unfavorable social comparisons with
peers]{.underline}, [but,]{.underline} rather, [may actually be the
outcome of actors succumbing to the stresses and failures of their own
history]{.underline}. The implications of applying this temporal
approach, I argue, are twofold. First, I suggest [that if actors develop
status insecurities because]{.underline} of unfavorable
[temporal]{.underline} rather than social [comparisons]{.underline},
then [they]{.underline} Freedman 799 [will]{.underline} be more likely
to [associate status recognition with the **correction of**]{.underline}
what they perceive to be **[a historic wrong]{.underline}** than they
are to associate it with the club goods and symbols commonly linked with
great power status. **[In this sense, China's perception of its own
status recognition should hinge]{.underline}** as much
**[on]{.underline}** the rights and obligations afforded to it by the
other great powers in the international system as it should on its
ability to match an idealized image of itself from its past. Here**[,
the unresolved]{.underline}** and unfavorable **[status of
Taiwan]{.underline}** becomes as important a marker of China's perpetual
lack of status as unfavorable voting rights in the world's major
institutions. As such, [the second implication of]{.underline} [applying
a temporal approach]{.underline} [to the study of status in IR is the
problem that it poses for the "status incentives]{.underline}"
literature, w[hich advances a logic]{.underline} of status recognition
[centered around international institutions and diplomatic protocol. If,
however, a country's status insecurities result from unfavorable
temporal comparisons]{.underline}, then, as the first implication
suggests, **[the ideas that they hold as being necessary for their own
arrival as a great power may not hinge on such commonly held status
markers.]{.underline}** In raising this critique, this article takes as
its starting point Pouliot's (2014: 194) contention that "practical
notions of status evolve over time and space" precisely because "\[i\]n
the absence of a symbolic hegemon ... various understandings of status
compete against one another, and markers often remain ambiguous and
disputed." Accordingly, in asking why China appears fixated on the issue
of great power status and recognition despite its objective economic and
military power, and despite the observations of many that it has already
been recognized as a great power,6 this article seeks to understand the
source of China's perception that it lacks status recognition, and
accordingly the source of its status insecurity. In making the claim
that China's status insecurity can be better understood by incorporating
TCT into the existing literature, the goal of this article is to
convince social comparison theorists in IR of the incompleteness of
their argument by presenting TCT's usefulness and applicability. The
goal of this article is not --- borrowing language from Price and
Tannenwald (1996: 152) --- "to defeat \[social comparison theorists\] in
some epic Lakatosian battle as if only one can exist and the other must
perish." Stuart Albert (1977: 489), who inaugurated the temporal
comparison research program in psychology, admitted as much when he
remarked that: \[j\]ust as it is not always true that individuals are
obsessed with self-evaluation and select social comparison processes as
the means for doing so, so it is equally wrong to believe that an
individual is completely engaged in explicit temporal comparison
processes to maintain an enduring self-identity over time.

### 2NC/2AC -- Econ R/C

#### Economic inequality is the root cause of status competition

\*\*We do not endorse ableist language

It is well known that [economic inequality is rising]{.underline}. In
most industrialised nations the [distribution of wealth and income is
becoming increasingly concentrated]{.underline}. In the United States,
the top 10% of earners make more than [nine times as
much](http://inequality.org/income-inequality/) on average as the
remainder, and in Australia the ratio approaches five. It is also well
known that [rising economic inequality is associated with a range of
**economic and social ills**]{.underline}. More [unequal
societies]{.underline} tend to [have worse
[health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577953), more
[obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16020644), more [violent
crime](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/073401689301800203),
more [political
instability](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014292195000305),
and more [institutional
corruption](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000312240507000107)]{.underline}.
What is less well known is that [economic inequality also has
psychological effects]{.underline}. For example, there is evidence that
[people]{.underline} in more unequal societies tend to h[ave lower
levels of [life
satisfaction](http://www.gini-research.org/system/uploads/374/original/DP_38_-_Ferrer-i-Carbonell_Ramos.pdf)
and higher rates of
[depression](https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/income-inequality-and-depression-prevalence-across-the-united-sta-3).]{.underline}
[These]{.underline} and other psychological [effects]{.underline} on
individuals [may help to explain the larger scale social
effects]{.underline} of inequality. An important new [review
article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spc3.12304/abstract)
makes a strong case for the explanatory role of two phenomena in
particular. [Nicholas
[Buttrick]{.underline}](http://psychology.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/nrb8pv)
[and]{.underline} [Shigehiro
[Oishi]{.underline}](http://psychology.as.virginia.edu/people/profile/so5x)
[argue]{.underline} economic [inequality breeds mistrust and **status
competition**]{.underline}. These have downstream effects on health and
well-being in more unequal societies. Mistrust Buttrick and Oishi
demonstrate that [inequality is associated with a generalised **distrust
of other people**]{.underline}. People who see large economic
disparities tend to believe the economic system is unfair and others are
advancing themselves by questionable means. This lack of trust is
amplified by high levels of class-based segregation in unequal
societies, which reduces opportunities for people to interact outside
their socioeconomic bubbles. The [combination of distrust and
unfamiliarity contributes to a lack of social cohesion and a sense that
socioeconomic divides are **deep and inevitable**]{.underline}. Mistrust
undermines social connection and civility. [Studies]{.underline}
comparing US states [find that]{.underline} residents of [more unequal
states are less likely to participate in]{.underline} [social
[groups]{.underline}](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4551796/alesina_participation.pdf?sequence=2),
a form of disengagement associated with poorer health outcomes according
to [Australian
research](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-social-cure-why-do-groups-make-us-healthier-and-how-can-we-capitalise-on-these-curing-properties/).
Wealthy residents of these states are also less likely to [contribute to
charity](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/52/15838.full). [People in more
unequal]{.underline} American [states even show differences in their
personality and willingness to engage in **immoral
behaviour**]{.underline}. [One
study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21612851)found they score
relatively low on agreeableness -- a trait that includes tendencies to
be friendly and cooperative.
[Another](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611435980)
revealed that people from these states were more likely to conduct
Google searches for academic cheating aids. [Diminished
trust]{.underline} in economically unequal societies [may have large
social effects.]{.underline} Low generalised trust partially accounts
for the relationship between [inequality and
mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951926/)
observed in a sample of 33 countries, which endures even when public
health expenditures are statistically controlled. It also partially
explains the link between [inequality and homicide
rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20525751) in those countries.
In short, a society where people do not trust one another is at risk of
ill health and violent crime. Such societies tend to have relatively
large economic disparities. According to Buttrick and Oishi, mistrust is
only one of the psychological processes that account for inequality's
adverse social effects. The other is status competition. [People in
highly unequal societies are more concerned with where they stand on the
**status hierarchy**]{.underline}. [Status anxiety may appear as fears
of losing one's economic standing or concerns about how others perceive
it]{.underline}.

### AT: ! -- Status Competition

#### there is no impact to status competition -- multiple checks prove

**Dal, Ph.D., 6/13/2019** (Emel Parlar, Associate Professor at Marmara
University's Department of International Relations, "Status competition
and rising powers in global governance: an introduction", Contemporary
Politics, ISSN: 1356-9775 (Print) 1469-3631, pp. 10-12, 6/13)micahw

Since [status is very closely linked to the identity management of
states and can be ascribed as a result of the overlapping of
self-perception and recognition]{.underline}, [states always remain in
need of achieving positive identity, role and status relative to their
peers or higher-status states in the international
hierarchy]{.underline}. Additionally, the current [power
shifts]{.underline} accelerated in the international system since the
mid-2000s, the emerging crisis in multilateralism as well as the rise of
informal institutions in global governance seem to have [made states
turn to status politics more ambitiously than they have done in the
past]{.underline}. Another characteristic of status-seeking policies of
rising powers is that they are mostly leader-driven. [Internal dynamics
of rising powers and their leaders' foreign policy choices also shape
the way and degree to which they engage in status competition in status
clubs]{.underline}. **[Here the question that needs to be asked is
whether status competition among rising powers leads to an increase in
their status recognition in the eyes of their peers and higher-status
states]{.underline}**. In status clubs like G20 for instance, status
competition among rising powers is generally less obvious mainly due to
the structure of the G20 which is composed of both rising, middle and
major powers. However, this does not point to a lack of competition
among rising powers. In contrast, [among the rising powers of G20
competition and cooperation coexist]{.underline} and **[in some cases
status competition may generate further cooperation as indicated by
Sino-Russian relations]{.underline}**. **[The competition--cooperation
coexistence also justifies the argument that status and its end result
-- status recognition -- are all social processes and
relational]{.underline}**. Given this, [it will not be false to argue
that status competition among rising powers may also contribute to the
reinforcing of their status recognition]{.underline}. Here, it must also
be remembered that status recognition is high among states that have
common values, shared interests and resources. This argument also brings
us to the following conclusion: **[if correctly used by states, status
competition among the states in the same peer group may serve as an
important tool to reinforce their diplomatic network]{.underline}**.
This means that status competition emanating from geopolitical rivalry
among peers may end up with cooperation. This also suggests that [status
competition among rising powers]{.underline} does not always lead to
aggressive behaviour. In contrast, it [may pave the way for the
reinforcement of cooperation among the lower-status states in the same
peer grouping]{.underline}. On the other hand, [rising
powers]{.underline} are certainly not mirror images of one another. They
have different motivations and capacity of influence in global
governance in general and in status clubs in particular. Similarly, they
pose different challenges for major powers. This also i[mpacts the way
major powers recognize their status internationally and positively
perceive their status-seeking strategies as a way to upgrade their
status vis-à-vis]{.underline} both [the major powers]{.underline} and
their peers. A close assessment of status competition among rising
powers shows that [this competition is peaceful rather than being
conflictual or aggressive]{.underline}. [For instance, rising powers aim
to upgrade their status in status clubs through economic, geopolitical,
ideational and normative means]{.underline}. This is not to say that
military power does not play any role in the current status rivalry
among rising peers. Of course, it can be used as a tool of coercion
backing their other status-seeking strategies. In short, **[status
competition among rising powers is not in the form of the classic
political-military competition]{.underline}**. It also does not look
like the great power competition which is much more complex today due to
the inexistence of roughly equivalent great powers as seen in the
rivalry of U.S and China and of U.S and Russia. Last but not least,
**[since status is relational, status competition goes beyond the
material attributes of states]{.underline}**. Ideational patterns are
equally important in order to assess rising powers' status-seeking
behaviours in different status clubs. [The current literature on status
politics does not focus too much on the ideational factors behind the
quest of rising powers for attaining higher status in formal and
informal international organizations]{.underline}. The existing
literature on status competition also neglects the role of ideas in
states' pursuit of 'rivalry' strategies against each other. Further
studies on status/status politics may well go beyond the use of
'material attributes' in the assessment of status-seeking strategies of
lower status states. [The measuring of states' status in the
international hierarchy and their sub-hierarchies also appears as a new
field of research on status/status politics]{.underline}.

## Conflict Deaths

### AT: Pinker

#### Pinker and Goldstein's data doesn't take into account failed homicides or unsuccessful attempts at territorial conquest

**Fazal, PhD, 14**

(Tanisha, Ph.D.: Political Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA,
2001. "Dead Wrong?: Battle Deaths, Military Medicine, and Exaggerated
Reports of War\'s Demise." 2014.
http://muse.jhu.edu/article/553214.)//bc

Several sources of data appear to support the claim that war is on the
decline. Pinker draws on Lewis Richardson's argument that armed
conflicts tend to follow power law distributions in their incidence and
magnitude. This finding \[End Page 97\] suggests that large, cataclysmic
wars will be relatively rare.7 Related, Pinker refers frequently to John
Mueller's finding that great powers no longer fight each other.8 In
addition, using data from The Great Big Book of Horrible Things9---an
encyclopedia of atrocities---Pinker finds that the percentage of
territorial wars from 1651 to 2000 that resulted in the redistribution
of territory dropped precipitously in the early to mid-twentieth
century.10 In reaching their conclusions, both Goldstein and Pinker rely
heavily on the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) battle deaths
data.11 Pinker, for example, graphs the rate of battle deaths in
state-based conflicts, the number of state-based conflicts, and the
deadliness of interstate and civil wars. These graphs principally cover
the second half of the twentieth century and beyond.12 Figure 1
replicates a version of Pinker's figure 6-4, which illustrates a
downward trend in war fatalities. As Pinker notes, this trend is
particularly stark with respect to interstate wars.13 In making their
claims, [Goldstein]{.underline} [and]{.underline} especially
[Pinker]{.underline} [rely heavily on the number of battle fatalities as
a metric of war]{.underline}.14 Battle deaths are used widely by
international relations scholars because death is unambiguous. Yet,
**[what if the probability of dying from wounds sustained in war has
changed over time]{.underline}**?15 \[End Page 98\] To [make a claim
about the decline]{.underline} (or rise) [of X]{.underline} (insert your
most or least-favorite phenomenon here), [one must consider the
possibility of selection effects]{.underline}. For example, [if one were
to use the number of first-class letters delivered by national postal
services as a measure of social cohesion within a country]{.underline},
[it would at first seem sensible to conclude that the world's richest
states saw significant drops]{.underline} in social cohesion beginning
in the late 1990s. The [precipitous decline in postal delivery does
not,]{.underline} however, indicat[e a decline in the desire to
communicate as much as a shift to modern forms of communication such as
email and Facebook]{.underline}. I illustrate this point further using
two other examples from Pinker's book. First, [prior to his discussion
about the decline of war,]{.underline} [Pinker argues that interpersonal
violence has also declined]{.underline}. He presents some of his
strongest evidence on this point in his figure 3-4, which shows a
dramatic decline in homicide rates in Western Europe and nonstate
societies from 1300 to 2000.16 [Missing from]{.underline} this and
[Pinker's subsequent graphs]{.underline}, however, **[is a count of
attempted]{.underline}** \[End Page 99\] **[homicides]{.underline}**.
[The reason to include attempted homicides is that the likelihood of
surviving a knife]{.underline} [wound]{.underline} in London [was
dramatically lower in 1400 than the likelihood of surviving the same
wound today.]{.underline} Significant advances in medical care make such
care both more available and more effective today than in the past.
Here, [Pinker's decision not to define "violence"]{.underline} **[is
particularly problematic]{.underline}** in assessing his claim about its
putative decline.17 [If by "violence" Pinker means
fatalities]{.underline}, then [he is correct that violence is on the
decline]{.underline}. [A standard dictionary definition of
violence]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, **[would include the
attempt or threat to inflict bodily harm]{.underline}**.18 Second,
[Pinker makes a similar misstep in his brief analysis of territorial
conquest]{.underline}. Drawing on data from Mark Zacher[, he illustrates
a dramatic drop in the percentage of territorial wars]{.underline}
resulting in the redistribution of territory beginning in the early to
mid-twentieth century.19 But again, [missing from Pinker's
analysis]{.underline} is **[whether attempts at territorial
redistribution also declined]{.underline}**. [Unsuccessful attempts to
redistribute territor]{.underline}y **[could be more violent than
successful ones;]{.underline}** [scholars therefore need to examine both
failed and successful efforts at territorial redistribution]{.underline}
to determine whether such efforts are becoming less frequent. I follow
Pinker and use Zacher's data to show that [even though the number of
territorial redistributions has declined]{.underline}, [the number of
territorial wars]{.underline}---that is, wars where at least one
belligerent aims to redistribute territory---**[has actually increased
over the course of the twentieth century]{.underline}** (see figure
2).20 Ignoring failed attempts at homicide, territorial redistribution,
or killing in war might possibly be unproblematic for, or even
supportive of, the thesis that war is on the decline. Data on attempted
homicides, for example, might reveal that kind-hearted passersby are
increasingly likely to intervene to save the life of a potential murder
victim. Similarly, some scholars have argued that a norm against
forcible territorial conquest accounts at least in part for the observed
decline of such conquest.21 But [in the realm of battle
deaths,]{.underline} [this argument]{.underline} \[End Page 100[\] is
more difficult to support]{.underline}. **[One would have to
convincingly show that today's soldiers are more likely to try to save a
severely wounded comrade]{.underline}** or enemy than **[they were in
the past]{.underline}** [because they have been influenced by modern
humanitarian norms]{.underline}. The conventional wisdom suggests,
however, **[that soldiers fight to protect one another,22 and there is
no evidence to show that this motive has changed.]{.underline}**

[Counting war fatalities]{.underline} as a means to measure the
frequency of war [is a]{.underline}n apparently sensible but,
ultimately, [flawed strategy given recent developments in technology and
warfare]{.underline}. Death is final and corpses are easier to count
than the wounded. **[That fewer people are dying in war, however, does
not mean that war is at an end.]{.underline}** Indeed, [it does not even
necessarily mean that war has become more humane.]{.underline} \[End

#### Enlightenment focus for improvement *[obscures]{.underline}* the negative effects of globalization and exploitation that *[reproduce inequality]{.underline}*

**Goldin, PhD, 18**

(Ian Goldin is Professor of Globalization and Development and director
of the Oxford Martin Programme on Technological and Economic Change at
the University of Oxford, UK, and the author of Age of Discovery and The
Butterfly Defect, Nature International Journal of Science, "The
limitations of Steven Pinker's optimism," 2-16 // NC)

Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Now builds on his 2011 The Better Angels
of Our Nature (Viking) in offering another engaging, compelling set of
reasons to be cheerful. In this new combined survey, analysis and
manifesto, he convincingly demonstrates that when it comes to health and
life expectancy, poverty reduction and income, education, human rights,
peace and security, **[the global data provide solid grounds for
optimism.]{.underline}** **[But the book's premise lies in the past: the
Enlightenment]{.underline}**, that period in the eighteenth century
when, Pinker argues, reason, science, humanism and progress became the
centre of intellectual endeavour in Europe and North America. That
legacy, he asserts, is ripe for resurrection at a time of political
upheaval, the rise of demagoguery, climate scepticism and 'fake news'.
The Enlightenment undoubtedly saw major advances in constitutional
government. The separation of church and state in some nations allowed
new models of society to flourish. But using the era as a premise is
problematic. **[Many of the breakthroughs that Pinker attributes to the
Enlightenment actually pre-date it]{.underline}**. As Chris Kutarna and
I showed in Age of Discovery (Bloomsbury, 2017), [the Renaissance was a
period of even more dramatic progress]{.underline} in science and the
humanities, sparked by luminaries such as the astronomer Nicolaus
Copernicus and the humanist Erasmus (see P. Ball Nature 452, 816--818;
2008). [Before that were extraordinarily innovative epochs in
Asia]{.underline} and other regions, [such as China's Tang
dynasty]{.underline} (ad 618--907) [and the Islamic Golden
Age]{.underline} (750--1260). Another issue we highlighted is that
**[less salubrious aspects of change accompanied eras of rapid
progress]{.underline}**. During the Renaissance [voyages of
discovery,]{.underline} European sailors spread diseases that [killed
millions of indigenous Americans]{.underline}. Europe saw [the rise of
religious extremists]{.underline} --- such as the demagogue Girolamo
Savonarola, who ruled Florence in the 1490s --- along with intolerance
of diversity and science. [Enlightenment advances were tied to empire
building and the nascent Industrial Revolution, predicated]{.underline}
not just [on]{.underline} noble ideas and scientific curiosity, but also
on slavery, genocide, exploitation and cultural triumphalism. Like the
Renaissance, it ended in chaos and conflict, including the French
revolutionary wars of 1792--99. Both eras show that science and
evidence-based thinking do not necessarily triumph over irrationality
and ideology. Shared social norms and ethics are the framework that
allows reason to prevail. Moreover, progress in science and society is a
tapestry that cannot be unpicked through simple periodization. That
said, comparing historical eras can be instructive. Although history
does not repeat itself, it may rhyme; it can offer insights into
predicaments and solutions, as I have found helpful, for instance, in
conceptualizing the future of work. Many of the Enlightenment's
philosophical, social and scientific advances offer lessons for our
reason-starved times, as Pinker ably argues; but context is key.
Although it is framed as a historically informed template for a new age
of reason, [Enlightenment]{.underline} Now ultimately
[becomes]{.underline} something else: [an extended dismissal of the
arguments of despair that Pinker fears are defining politics and
crowding out an alternative approach rooted in rationality and global
cooperation.]{.underline} He does not frame the thesis in economic
terms. [Yet he essentially defends globalization]{.underline} and the
growth of market economies by claiming that it has brought more progress
than any force in history. As an economist, I agree. [But globalization
has also led to an escalation of risks. What is rational for individuals
is increasingly irrational for society. **The drivers of progress are
rising incomes and connectivity; these also lead to greater negative
spillovers and systemic risk**]{.underline}. Managing globalization's
underbelly is essential, and the gulf between what needs to be done and
what is being done is widening. **[Economic growth has come at the
expense of ecosystems]{.underline}**. Because nature does not respond to
price signals (rhinos do not reproduce more when their horns are more
valuable), **[increasing freedom of choice has led to overexploitation
of a growing number of natural systems.]{.underline}** Pinker does cite
climate change, but as a worrying exception to a relentlessly positive
narrative, rather than as the most glaring example of a wider failure of
global commons management.

#### Pinker's theories are *[gross mischaracterizations]{.underline}* of data -- globalization doesn't check other countries rather increases the magnitude of one crisis 

**Goldin, PhD, 18**

(Ian Goldin is Professor of Globalization and Development and director
of the Oxford Martin Programme on Technological and Economic Change at
the University of Oxford, UK, and the author of Age of Discovery and The
Butterfly Defect, Nature International Journal of Science, "The
limitations of Steven Pinker's optimism," 2-16 // NC)

[Pinker devotes a chapter to inequality.]{.underline} Drawing on the
encyclopedic website Our World in Data by economist Max Roser of the
Oxford Martin School, UK, [he shows that global inequality]{.underline}
(between richer and poorer countries[) is decreasing, whereas inequality
within countries is rising]{.underline}. He concludes that much current
anxiety around inequality --- spurred by the idea that the top 1% is
absorbing the lion's share of economic growth --- is misplaced. I don't
agree[. First, the data he presents do not reflect recent sharp
**economic reversals in many places.** These are likely to become more
significant in some regions.]{.underline} [For instance, in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [cuts to health-care subsidies
and corporate tax rates over the past few months will reduce
redistribuion and weaken the safety nets that]{.underline} (as Pinker
identifies) [helped to alleviate inequality after the 2008 financial
crisis]{.underline}. [Second, he does n]{.underline}o[t]{.underline}
[give enough **weight to the plight of the jobless**]{.underline} ---
and, in the United States, its association with [the growing problem of
opioid misuse --- or the threat that]{.underline} robots and artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) [pose to jobs.]{.underline} [Growing
inequality]{.underline} within countries is [underminin]{.underline}g
[social cohesion and promot]{.underline}ing [extremist political
views]{.underline}, and this is likely to be compounded by technological
change. If most tasks that are repetitive and do not demand dexterity
are automated --- which is possible, according to research at the Oxford
Martin School --- what is the model of future employment in
administrative back offices, call centres or manufacturing? [Pinker is
too sanguine about such immediate threats]{.underline} (although he
argues cogently in favour of minimizing the expenditure of intellectual
and political capital on remote risks, such as the existential threat
posed by AI). He also underestimates the threats that Mike Mariathasan
and I set out in our 2015 book The Butterfly Defect (Princeton
University Press): interconnected systems raise interdependence,
complexity and systemic risk[. With globalization, as connectivity,
incomes and consumption grow, so **risks become multidimensional and
transnational --- witness**]{.underline} **[pandemics, cascading
financial crises and cyberattacks. New technologies turbocharge these
risks and give new powers to individuals and small
groups.]{.underline}** Pinker looks in some depth at the rise in
scepticism about science, in society and in parts of academia such as
the humanities. He gives shorter shrift to the erosion of faith in
expertise elsewhere, even though this is justified in some notable
instances. The financial sector, for example, is home to the biggest and
most powerful global expert system, from banks and treasuries to the
International Monetary Fund. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the
inadequacy of that system, whose primary mission is financial stability.
Similarly, accounting firms have given clean bills of health to corrupt
or collapsing enterprises. The denial of evidence is irrational, but it
is not necessarily irrational to challenge experts and authorities.
[Pinker]{.underline} highlights the importance of ideas in human
advances, but claims that "intellectuals hate progress" --- a surprising
generalization in a case for evidence and reason. And herein lies both
the strength and weakness of this book. It [provides copious reasons for
optimism.]{.underline} It claims to be a scientific, evidence-based
account; but that **[is undermined by its scant attention to the
mounting evidence on new risks.]{.underline}** I share Pinker's optimism
that this could be our best century, in which poverty and many of the
challenges humanity has historically confronted are addressed. Yet there
is also a real potential for dystopian outcomes as sea levels, strife,
temperatures and resistant infections rise, and biodiversity, democratic
institutions, social ties, mental health and resource security are
eroded. We need to face up to these and other daunting challenges while
nurturing the positivity required to tackle them.

[The picture of declining violence presented by this new orthodoxy is
not all it seems to be]{.underline}. As some critics, notably John
Arquilla, have pointed out, [it's a mistake to focus too heavily on
declining fatalities on the battlefield]{.underline}. If these deaths
have been falling, one reason is the balance of terror: nuclear weapons
have so far prevented industrial-style warfare between great powers.
[Pinker dismisses the role of nuclear weapons on the grounds that the
use of other weapons of mass destruction such as poison gas has not
prevented war in the past; but nuclear bombs are incomparably more
destructive]{.underline}. No serious military historian doubts that fear
of their use has been a major factor in preventing conflict between
great powers. Moreover, deaths of non-combatants have been steadily
rising. Around a million of the 10 million deaths due to the first world
war were of non‑combatants, whereas around half of the more than 50

warfare against each other while avoiding direct military conflict.

it is true that war has changed, it [has not become less
destructive]{.underline}. Rather than a contest between well-organised
states that can at some point negotiate peace**[, it is now more often a
many-sided conflict in fractured or collapsed states that no one has the
power to end.]{.underline}** The protagonists are armed irregulars, some
of them killing and being killed for the sake of an idea or faith,
others from fear or a desire for revenge and yet others from the world's
swelling armies of mercenaries, who fight for profit. [For all of them,
attacks on civilian populations have become normal.]{.underline} The
ferocious [conflict in Syria,]{.underline} [in which methodical
starvation]{.underline} and the systematic destruction of urban
environments [are deployed as strategies]{.underline}, [is an example of
this type of warfare. It may be true that the modern state's monopoly of
force has led]{.underline}, in some contexts, **[to declining rates of
violent death. But it is also true that the power of the modern state
has been used for purposes of mass killing,]{.underline}** and one
should not pass too quickly over victims of state terror. With
increasing historical knowledge it has become clear that the
"Holocaust-by-bullets" -- the mass shootings of Jews, mostly in the
Soviet Union, during the second world war -- was perpetrated on an even
larger scale than previously realised. Soviet agricultural
collectivisation incurred millions of foreseeable deaths, mainly as a
result of starvation, with deportation to uninhabitable regions,
life-threatening conditions in the Gulag and military-style operations
against recalcitrant villages also playing an important role. Peacetime
deaths due to internal repression under the Mao regime have been
estimated to be around 70 million. Along with fatalities caused by state
terror were unnumbered millions whose lives were irreparably broken and
shortened. How these casualties fit into the scheme of declining
violence is unclear. Pinker goes so far as to suggest that the
20th-century Hemoclysm might have been a gigantic statistical fluke, and
cautions that any history of the last century that represents it as
having been especially violent may be "apt to exaggerate the narrative
coherence of this history" (the italics are Pinker's[). However, there
is an equal or greater risk in abandoning a coherent and truthful
narrative of the violence of the last century for the sake of a spurious
quantitative precision.]{.underline} **[Estimating the numbers of those
who die from violence involves complex questions of cause and
effect]{.underline}**, which cannot always be separated from moral
judgments. [There are many kinds of lethal force that do not produce
immediate death]{.underline}. Are those who die of [hunger]{.underline}
or [disease]{.underline} during war or its aftermath counted among the
casualties? Do [refugees]{.underline} whose lives are cut short appear
in the count? Where torture is used in war, will its victims figure in
the calculus if they succumb years later from the [physical and mental
damage]{.underline} that has been inflicted on them? Do infants who are
born to brief and painful lives as a result of exposure to Agent Orange
or depleted [uranium]{.underline} find a place in the roll call of the
dead? If women who have been [rape]{.underline}d as part of a military
strategy of sexual violence die before their time, will their passing
feature in the statistical tables? There is something repellently absurd
in the notion that war is a vice of 'backward' peoples While the seeming
exactitude of statistics may be compelling, much of the human cost of
war is incalculable**[. Deaths by violence are not all
equal]{.underline}**. It is terrible to die as a conscript in the
trenches or a civilian in an aerial bombing campaign, but to perish from
overwork, beating or cold in a labour camp can be a greater evil[. It is
worse still to be killed as part of a systematic campaign of
extermination as happened to those who were consigned to death camps
such as Treblinka]{.underline}. [Disregarding these distinctions, the
statistics presented by those who celebrate the]{.underline} arrival of
the [Long Peace are morally dubious if not meaningless]{.underline}. The
radically contingent nature of the figures is another reason for not
taking them too seriously. (For a critique of Pinker's statistical
methods, see Nassim Nicholas Taleb's essay on the Long Peace.) If the
socialist revolutionary Fanya Kaplan had succeeded in assassinating
Lenin in August 1918, violence would still have raged on in Russia. But
the Soviet state might not have survived and could not have been used by
Stalin for slaughter on a huge scale. If a resolute war leader had not
unexpectedly come to power in Britain in May 1940, and the country had
been defeated or (worse) made peace with Germany as much of the British
elite wanted at the time, Europe would likely have remained under Nazi
rule for generations to come -- time in which plans of racial
purification and genocide could have been more fully implemented.
Discussing the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 in which nuclear war was
narrowly averted, Pinker dismisses the view that "the de-escalation was
purely a stroke of uncanny good luck". Instead, he explains the fact
that nuclear war was avoided by reference to the superior judgment of
Kennedy and Khrushchev, who had "an intuitive grasp of game theory" --
an example of increasing rationality in history, Pinker believes. But a
disastrous escalation in the crisis may in fact have been prevented only
by a Soviet submariner, Vasili Arkhipov, who refused to obey orders from
his captain to launch a nuclear torpedo. Had it not been for the
accidental presence of a single courageous human being, a nuclear
conflagration could have occurred causing fatalities on a vast scale. A

is something repellently absurd in the notion that war is a vice of
"backward" peoples. Destroying some of the most refined civilisations
that have ever existed, the wars that ravaged south-east Asia in the
second world war and the decades that followed were the work of colonial
powers. One of the causes of the genocide in Rwanda was the segregation
of the population by German and Belgian imperialism. Unending war in the
Congo has been fuelled by western demand for the country's natural
resources. If violence has dwindled in advanced societies, one reason
may be that they have exported it. Then again, the idea that violence is
declining in the most highly developed countries is questionable. Judged
by accepted standards, the United States is the most advanced society in
the world. According to many estimates the US also has the highest rate
of incarceration, some way ahead of China and Russia, for example.
[Around a quarter of all the world's prisoners are held in American
jails,]{.underline} many for exceptionally long periods[. Black people
are disproportionately represented, many prisoners are mentally ill and
growing numbers are aged and infirm]{.underline}. [Imprisonment in
America involves continuous risk of assault by other
prisoners]{.underline}. There is the threat of long periods spent in
[solitary confinement]{.underline}, sometimes (as in "supermax"
facilities, where something like Bentham's Panopticon has been
constructed) for indefinite periods -- a type of treatment that has been
reasonably classified as torture. [Cruel and unusual punishments
involving flogging and mutilation]{.underline} may have been abolished
in many countries, but, along with unprecedented levels of mass
incarceration, **[the practice of torture seems to be integral to the
functioning of the world's most advanced state]{.underline}**. It may
not be an accident that torture is often deployed in the special
operations that have replaced more traditional types of warfare. [The
extension of counter-terrorism to include assassination by unaccountable
mercenaries and remote-controlled killing by drones is part of this
shift]{.underline}. A metamorphosis in the nature is war is under way,
which is global in reach. With the state of Iraq in ruins as a result of
US-led regime change, a third of the country is controlled by Isis,
which is able to inflict genocidal attacks on Yazidis and wage a
campaign of terror on Christians with near-impunity. In Nigeria, the
Islamist militias of Boko Haram practise a type of warfare featuring
mass killing of civilians, razing of towns and villages and sexual
enslavement of women and children. In Europe, targeted killing of
journalists, artists and Jews in Paris and Copenhagen embodies a type of
warfare that refuses to recognise any distinction between combatants and
civilians. Whether they accept the fact or not, advanced societies have
become terrains of violent conflict. Rather than war declining, the
difference between peace and war has been fatally blurred. [Deaths on
the battlefield have fallen and may continue to fall. From one angle
this can be seen as an advancing condition of peace. From another point
of view that looks at the variety and intensity with which violence is
being employed, **the Long Peace can be described as a condition of
perpetual conflict.**]{.underline}

In November 2017, [around the time when Pinker was likely putting the
final touches on his manuscript, over fifteen thousand scientists from
184 countries issued a dire warning to humanity]{.underline}. [Because
of our overconsumption of the world's resources, they declared, we are
facing "widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss." They
warned that time is running out]{.underline}: "Soon it will be too late
to shift course away from our failing trajectory." JeremyLent1.png
Figure 1: Three graphs from World Scientists\' Warning to Humanity: A
Second Notice. They included nine sobering charts and a carefully
worded, extensively researched analysis showing that, on a multitude of
fronts, the human impact on the earth's biological systems is increasing
at an unsustainable rate. Three of those alarming graphs are shown here:
the rise in CO2 emissions; the decline in available freshwater; and the
increase in the number of ocean dead zones from artificial fertilizer
runoff. This was not the first such notice. Twenty-five years earlier,
in 1992, 1,700 scientists (including the majority of living Nobel
laureates) sent a similarly worded warning to governmental leaders
around the world, calling for a recognition of the earth's fragility and
a new ethic arising from the realization that "we all have but one
lifeboat." The current graphs starkly demonstrate how little the world
has paid attention to this warning since 1992. [Taken together, these
graphs illustrate ecological overshoot:]{.underline} the fact that, [in
the pursuit of material progress, our civilization is consuming the
earth's resources faster than they can be replenished]{.underline}.
Overshoot is particularly dangerous because of its relatively slow
feedback loops: if your checking account balance approaches zero, you
know that if you keep writing checks they will bounce. In overshoot,
however, it's as though our civilization keeps taking out bigger and
bigger overdrafts to replenish the account, and then we pretend these
funds are income and celebrate our continuing "progress." In the end, of
course, the money runs dry and it's game over. [Pinker claims to respect
science, yet he blithely ignores fifteen thousand scientists' desperate
warning to humanity. Instead,]{.underline} he uses the blatant
rhetorical technique of ridicule to paint those concerned about
overshoot as part of a "quasi-religious ideology... laced with
misanthropy, including an indifference to starvation, an indulgence in
ghoulish fantasies of a depopulated planet, and Nazi-like comparisons of
human beings to vermin, pathogens, and cancer." [He]{.underline} then
[uses a couple of the most extreme examples he can find to create a
straw-man to buttress his caricature]{.underline}. There are issues
worthy of debate on the topic of civilization and sustainability, but to
approach a subject of such seriousness with emotion-laden rhetoric is
morally inexcusable and striking evidence of Monbiot's claim that Pinker
"insults the Enlightenment principles he claims to defend." When
[Pinker]{.underline} does get serious on the topic, he [promotes
Ecomodernism as the solution: a neoliberal, technocratic belief that a
combination of market-based solutions and technological fixes will
magically resolve all ecological problems. This approach
fails]{.underline}, however, [to take into account the structural
drivers of overshoot: **a growth-based global economy reliant on
ever-increasing monetization of natural resources and human
activity.**]{.underline} [**Without changing this structure, overshoot
is inevitable**. Transnational corporations]{.underline}, which
currently constitute sixty-nine of the world's hundred largest
economies, [are driven only by increasing short-term financial value for
their shareholders]{.underline}, regardless of the long-term impact on
humanity[. As freshwater resources decline,]{.underline} for example,
[their incentive is to buy up what remains]{.underline} and sell it in
plastic throwaway bottles or process it into sugary drinks, propelling
billions in developing countries toward obesity through sophisticated
marketing[. In fact, until an imminent collapse of civilization itself,
increasing ecological catastrophes are likely to enhance the GDP of
developed countries even while those in less developed regions suffer
dire consequences.]{.underline}

### AT: Battle Deaths Decreasing

[Rethinking the approach to how scholars]{.underline} of international
relations [count wars may require significant revisions to major
datasets such as the Correlates of War and the UCDP lists of armed
conflicts]{.underline}. Both datasets have a fatality threshold for
inclusion, and that threshold is constant for the entire period they
cover.113 But if, [because of improvements in military
medicine]{.underline}, **[the same conflict that produced 1,200
fatalities in 1860 is likely to have produced 800 fatalities in
1980]{.underline}** (or 35 versus 20, in the case of UCDP), **[the
ahistorical nature of the battle death threshold means that the latter
conflict(s) will have been left out of the data set]{.underline}**.
[Including these conflicts in Goldstein's and Pinker's analyses could
force a closer look at whether war has really declined]{.underline}. A
brief survey of UCDP's list of armed conflicts yields more than a dozen
conflicts that produced more than 500 battle deaths in the post-1946
period. [Among them is the 1963 "Sand War" between Morocco and
Algeria]{.underline}, where Micheal Clodfelter reports 300 Algerian and
200 Moroccan fatalities. Based on Algeria's wounded-to-killed ratio from
the independence war just prior to the interstate conflict with Morocco,
it is possible [that Algerian casualties alone exceeded the
1,000-combatant-death threshold used by the Correlates of
War]{.underline}.114 More recently, [Clodfelter reports 700 fatalities
in Thailand's civil war with the Patani in the south]{.underline}, which
began in 2003. This conflict is another candidate for inclusion in a
list of wars that takes all casualties into account. [Depending on a
number of factors---including the percentage of fatalities that have
been sustained by the government]{.underline}---usin[g past
wounded-to-killed ratios for Thailand suggests that this conflict may
have produced more than 1,000 battle casualtie]{.underline}s in a single
year.115 One cannot be confident in any of these adjustments, however,
until additional data on the battle wounded are available. [The
possibility that wars and armed conflicts have been undercounted because
existing datasets use a battle death threshold that does not change over
time **raises questions about the comparability of cases over
time**]{.underline} and the soundness of quantitative analyses that
cover the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, in particular. For
example, several scholars have debated whether democracies are more
likely to win the wars they fight and, if they are, why that would be
so.116 [What if democracies]{.underline}, especially twentieth-century
democracies, [are likely to have especially good military medical
care]{.underline}? Posing this \[End Page 123\] question raises at least
two possible implications for the debate. First, it may be that [certain
wars are not included in the observations under analysis]{.underline},
especially for the twentieth century. Second[, if democracies are more
likely to have stronger military medical systems]{.underline}, then,
[all else being equal, this could tip the balance in their favor in
prosecuting wars]{.underline}. In other words, relative capability in
military medicine could constitute an alternative explanation for the
finding that democracies are winners. To the extent that the general
result that democracies are more likely than nondemocracies to win the
wars they fight is sensitive to recodings of data,117 incorporating the
rise of military medicine could alter this finding. [Bringing military
medicine into the discussion of what counts as war also has implications
for society and policy]{.underline}. T[he massive investment that modern
militaries have made in military medicine reflects their view of its
importance]{.underline}, but the story of the battle wounded has
typically remained untold.118 For example, [in the first year of
Operation Enduring Freedom]{.underline}, [the New York Times published
just one story on the military wounded]{.underline}; its "Casualties"
column effectively redefined "casualty" to mean only fatalities.119
Moreover, [these reports include only the visibly wounded]{.underline},
[ignoring the thousands of veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress
disorder and other]{.underline} war-induced [psychiatric
conditions]{.underline}.120 Similarly, an influential book on casualty
aversion and public support for war in the United States explicitly
takes "casualty" to mean "fatality," and finds (in a robustness test)
that [including the wounded in survey experiments]{.underline} \[End
Page 124\] on casualty aversion [did not alter respondents' level of
support for conflict]{.underline}.121 [The wounded]{.underline}, in
other words**[, seem not to figure into "the human costs of war" in any
significant way.]{.underline}** More broadly[, using fatality counts as
a measure of war is increasingly questionable given new technologies of
warfare]{.underline}. U.S. [drone strikes]{.underline} in Afghanistan
and Pakistan [have probably killed fewer than 1,000 combatants each
annually]{.underline}.122 [Yet]{.underline}, in Pakistan's Federally
Administrated Tribal Areas, **[civilians and soldiers alike must surely
feel like they are living in a war zone]{.underline}**.123 In addition,
[the development of nonlethal weapons]{.underline}---used today
primarily for police actions---**[could result in conflicts with many
fewer direct casualties]{.underline}**.124 Similarly, a barrage of
[cyberattacks]{.underline}, which could cause a great deal of damage
with or without generating casualties directly, [could make a population
feel it was under siege]{.underline}.125 If, as Carl von Clausewitz
observed, "war is the continuation of politics by other means," must
those other means cause fatalities to qualify as war? More to the point,
must they cause a specific, constant number of fatalities? The [rapid
advances in military medicine in the last half century alone suggest
that an ahistorical measure of war may deny the severity]{.underline}
(and possibly incidence) [of many recent conflicts.]{.underline}
**[Although war may be wounded, it is]{.underline}**, sadly for all its

[In a narrow point of view, Pinker is correct:]{.underline} rates of
violent conflict have substantially decreased and there is reason to
believe they are at the lowest point in human history (if only because
data is limited). Also, at least among modern democracies, violence is
no longer seen as the default option for solving problems as it has been
for almost all of human history. That being said, it's worth thinking
about [how Pinker's argument made be misleading]{.underline}. [The first
point is that by focusing on rates rather than numbers, we are
**neglecting the actual human suffering**]{.underline}. More people
dying from war is more people dying from war even if the percentage is
decreasing. The numbers can be used to support multiple conclusions
depending on one's argument. **[A second central issue is, especially
for pre-historic societies, reliable data is hard to get]{.underline}**.
Most of the numbers for conflict rates and deaths in prehistoric
societies come by examining archaeological sites and looking at
artifacts for evidence of violent death. However, [it could be possible
these marks have been misinterpreted and anthropologists could
not]{.underline} possibly [have studied all prehistoric
societies]{.underline}. [Simple extrapolation what has been found is the
only option]{.underline}, but it's also important to not draw immature
conclusions. [The last major issue we'll cover here]{.underline} (for
more see Taleb's article**[) is that we could be living in an anomalous
age.]{.underline}** Pinker calls the most recent 70 years of peace (no
wars between modern nations[), "The Long Peace",]{.underline} but it
[could]{.underline} be **[really only the temporary
peace.]{.underline}** Furthermore, as pointed out by Taleb, [wars tend
to be power law distributed, that is, they have long tails skewed to the
right. The vast majority of deaths in armed conflicts are caused by a
small number of the conflicts]{.underline} as can be seen below:
Distribution of war casualty deaths on log **[scale One single conflict

## Ethnocentrism

### AT: Ethnocentrism Inevitable

#### Game theory models prove ethnocentrism is not inevitable -- rather an effect of *[structural immobility]{.underline}* 

**University of Maryland, 15**

(\"Moving matters: Ethnocentric behavior decreases when societal
mobility rises: Society\'s level of mobility influences whether its

The trend over the last century has been toward greater mobility for
more people around the world. Many people today live in a place
different from where they were born, with different social norms and
customs[. A new study by University of Maryland researchers points to a
surprising byproduct: increased mobility may help people to treat each
other as individuals rather than as members of a defined social group.
The work suggests]{.underline} that **[mobility counteracts the tendency
of populations to become more ethnocentric]{.underline}** \-- or prone
to favor members of their own ethnic, tribal or national group while
being hostile to other groups \-- over time. The study appears online in
the journal Nature Scientific Reports on Dec. 8, 2015. \"Our study marks
the first time that a computational model of evolutionary game theory
has been used to examine whether the well-studied psychological
phenomenon of ethnocentrism develops differently with increased
mobility,\" said Soham De, lead author of the study and a graduate
student in computer science at UMD. \"[The underlying message is very
hopeful: **ethnocentric behavior is not inevitable**, so perhaps there
are additional steps that human societies can take to reduce
conflict]{.underline}.\" Historically, most group conflicts have been
between people who define themselves primarily by the groups to which
they belong. **[Previous psychology research has established that such
categorization is natural]{.underline}**, with humans classifying others
into \'in groups\' and \'out groups.\' A common outcome is for
individuals to favor those in their own group while being hostile to
outsiders. [Indeed, many cultural psychology studies have suggested that
that this tendency toward ethnocentrism is inevitable]{.underline} in
the development of human societies[**. The current study supports the
idea that ethnocentric behavior is not inevitable**, but is affected by
structural conditions within a society, including overall levels of
mobility.]{.underline} The team began with a well-established computer
model of human behavior based on the tenets of game theory, a concept
that economists, political scientists and psychologists use to study
patterns of human decision-making. Such collaborations between computer
scientists and social scientists have become more common, as the former
can use computational models to test theories put forward by the latter.
\"[Evolutionary game theoretic models can help explain how a society\'s
characteristics may evolve over time, as individuals change their
actions and strategies in order to adapt to their current
conditions]{.underline},\" said study co-author Dana Nau, a professor of
computer science at UMD with a joint appointment in the UMD Institute
for Systems Research. \"[Although these models are much simpler than
real human societies, they can help to tease apart causal relationships
and provide support for social science theories]{.underline}.\" [By
introducing mobility into their model, the researchers dramatically
reduced the emergence of ethnocentric behavior]{.underline}. [Their
results indicated that when societies are more mobile]{.underline},
**[their actions are more likely to depend on seeing people as
individuals]{.underline}**, **[rather than as part of a perceived
group]{.underline}**. In addition[, the findings show that there is less
hostility toward other groups in]{.underline} highly [mobile places
compared with those with low mobility.]{.underline} Research in cultural
psychology suggests that in mobile societies, people strategically adapt
to their situation by changing their relationships often, having a broad
network of casual acquaintances and being open toward strangers. They
are likely to evaluate others based on their individual trustworthiness
and worth. But in places where people are not very mobile, opportunities
to form new relationships are limited \-- and ending existing
relationships can carry harsh consequences. In these places, maintaining
loyalty to one\'s own group while keeping a safe distance from other
groups is a good adaptive strategy. \"In contexts that are mobile,
people are constantly coming and going from different relationships;
being open to strangers is presumably adaptive in these circumstances,\"
said study co-author Michele Gelfand, a professor of psychology at UMD.
\"On the other hand, in low-mobility contexts, individuals have far
fewer opportunities to form new relationships. They get most of their
needs met through the group they identify with; in this context, in
makes more sense to treat people according to the groups to which they
belong.\" The researchers ran their game theoretic model through tens of
thousands of iterations, covering various scenarios on UMD\'s
Deepthought2 supercomputer cluster. In low-mobility scenarios, the
researchers found that 75 percent of the population adopted strategies
that favored their own group and were hostile to others. When the
researchers increased the amount of mobility in the model, the inverse
scenario developed, with about 70 percent of the population using
strategies that were more dependent on individual behavior. Thus,
mobility thwarted the evolutionary dominance of group perception and
ethnocentric strategies[. The team then tested their results against
real-life data from the U.S. Census Bureau,]{.underline} which provides
measures of mobility for all 50 states. [Mobility was positively
correlated with responses to the question,]{.underline} \"I am
interested in the cultures of other countries\" and negatively
correlated with responses to questions related to ethnocentric
attitudes[. This analysis of census data was consistent with the results
from the model]{.underline}. \"It\'s always good to test whether what
you predict in your model actually happens in real life,\" Nau said.
Gelfand is careful to note the research does not address how mobility
affects people\'s attitudes, but rather how it affects people\'s
interactions with one another. \"One characteristic an agent can have in
our model is whether they treat another person more as an individual,
rather than a member of a particular group,\" Gelfand said. \"As the
level of mobility goes up a bit, they start to need to have interactions
with new groups. They do much better in these kinds of circumstances if
they treat others as individuals. It becomes adaptive.\" Gelfand also
cautioned that because the model is very abstract, it will not apply to
every real-world scenario. \"But overall, in a mobility context, we
start treating people as individuals rather than recognizing them only
as a member of a category,\" she said.

prosper than non-cooperative groups]{.underline}. The social Darwinist
Spencer ( 1892 ) argued: A life of constant external enmity generates a
code in which aggression, conquest, revenge, are inculcated, while
peaceful occupations are reprobated. Conversely, a life of settled
internal amity generates a code inculcating the virtues conducing to
harmonious cooperation -- justice, honesty, veracity, regard for other's
claims (p. 471). According to Spencer, these two moral codes exist
together in modern and nonindustrial societies. Such ideas were also put
forward by Sumner ( 1906 ) . According to Keith ( 1949 ) , group
survival is possible only when intragroup cooperation and intergroup
competition are combined and in balance. Otherwise, Keith assumed, too
much cooperation or too much competition is detrimental to group
survival. More recent evolutionary explanations, based on
sociobiological theory, maintain that ethnocentrism is an extension of
the basic mechanism underlying kin group selection. Van den Berghe's (
1978, 1995 ) explanation for ethnocentrism illustrates this approach. He
argues that it is beneficial for animal species, including humans, to
cooperate and the main genetic mechanism for cooperation is kin
selection that maximizes inclusive fitness. Inclusive fitness assumes
that genes can be transmitted to ancestors through direct and kin
reproduction. Animals, therefore, tend to cooperate with their kin,
which they favour over non-kin. Because of its evolutionary usefulness,
humans have extended their kinship groups to ethnic groups. As Van den
Berghe states, "ethnocentrism evolved during millions, or at least
hundreds of thousands of years as an extension of kin selection" (p.
404). [Evolutionary explanations can be applied to the present
conceptualization of ethnocentrism]{.underline}. Stressing the
importance of the ethnic ingroup over others and over individual ingroup
members should help ethnic group survival and enhance the transmission
of the ethnic group's genetic material (i.e., extended kin group).
[**Evolutionary explanations of ethnocentrism have been criticized.** It
has never been convincingly demonstrated that ethnocentric groups are
more likely to survive than other groups]{.underline}. Similarly,
[mechanisms that enable the extension of kin group
selection]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [ethnic groups have not been
clearly elucidated]{.underline} (A. D. Smith, 2001 ) . In addition, it
has been argued that [central elements of sociobiological
explanations]{.underline} **[are often not testable]{.underline}** and
that [alternative explanations of the data]{.underline} **[are often
equally plausible and some data]{.underline}** (e.g., hostility,
non-cooperation, and destruction within kin groups) **[even contradict
the theory]{.underline}** (Ross, 1991 ) . Summary and Implications
Evolutionary theories often paint a bleak picture of humanity suggesting
that ethnocentrism is generally difficult, if not impossible, to change,
and may often result in conflicts and wars. [It is]{.underline},
however, [more likely,]{.underline} as M.B. Smith ( 1992 ) [put it, that
"ethnocentrism ... may well have biological roots in human evolution**,
although not necessarily of the sort assumed by the biodeterministic
pessimists**]{.underline}" (p. 84). The relationships between most
ethnic groups in the world tend to be relatively harmonious or often
neutral, and not necessarily confl ictual. Nevertheless, a certain
amount of ethnocentrism may exist in perhaps all ethnic groups, and this
may be due to evolutionary influences. Furthermore, although
ethnocentrism may be evolutionary, and perhaps inevitable, [most
scholars today reject the view that ethnic conflicts]{.underline}, such
as these in ex-Yugoslavia, are **[directly caused by inherent
evolutionary propensities of certain ethnic groups.]{.underline}**
Accordingly, although peace psychologists need to be acquainted with
evolutionary explanations of ethnocentrism, [it is important to note
that evolutionary influences are distal and do not necessarily result in
confl icts.]{.underline}

### AT: Ethnocentrism Intrinsic

#### Ethnocentrism is caused by group categorization and depersonalization -- it's not an intrinsic trait

**Bizumic, PhD, and Duckitt, PhD, 12**

(Boris, PhD from Australian National University, and John, Ph.D from the
University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. (2012), What Is and Is
Not Ethnocentrism? A Conceptual Analysis and Political Implications.
Political Psychology, 33: 887-909. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00907.x)
//bc

There have been many theories attempting to explain what causes
ethnocentrism. These theories have focused on different levels, ranging
from genetic to societal. Most theories dealt with diverse
conceptualizations of ethnocentrism and often did not specifically
differentiate mere ingroup positivity, outgroup negativity, and group
self-centeredness. In terms of social psychological theories, we argue
that this reconceptualization fits in well within three complementary
theories of intragroup and intergroup processes: [realistic conflict
theory]{.underline} (Sherif, 1966), [social identity]{.underline} theory
(Tajfel & Turner,1986), [and self-categorization theory]{.underline}
(Turner et al., 1987). A theoretical explanation follows (for a shorter
explanation, see Bizumic et al., 2009).[All three theories argue that
people become transformed when they are in groups]{.underline}, **[and
the process through which this happens is most fully explained by
self-categorization theory.]{.underline}** According to
self-categorization theory, the basis of group formation involves
categorization, which enables switching from a definition of oneself as
a separate individual to a definition of oneself as a group member.
[This involves depersonalization]{.underline}, through which
[individuals cognitively group themselves together with a social
category]{.underline} (in this instance, one's ethnic or cultural group)
and tend to see themselves as interchangeable with other group members.
As a result of this process, the person experiences himself or herself
at a different level, as a group member, and tends to give more
importance to the group than to his or her own separate individuality
and separate individuality of other ingroup members. Identification with
the group, accordingly, gives rise to what we called intragroup
ethnocentrism and involves two expressions: group cohesion (group unity
and integration become more important than individual freedoms) and
devotion (group interests take over personal self-interest and the
person is ready to sacrifice for the sake of the group if it needs to be
done). In short, [as a result of perceiving the self as one with the
group, the group and its interests]{.underline} (i.e., the whole)
**[become more important than one's own individuality and separate
individual group members]{.underline}**(i.e., the elements of the
whole).Sumner (1911) stated that [ethnocentrism primarily involves
sentiments of group cohesion and devotion]{.underline}, but he also
noted that [these dimensions carry with themselves other
sentiments]{.underline}, [which correspond to intergroup
ethnocentrism]{.underline}. He did not explain the social psychological
processes through which this happens. The social identity perspective
(involving social identity and self-categorization theories) offers such
an explanation. It argues that [group formation]{.underline} [can lead
to intergroup ethnocentrism]{.underline} **[because of the existence of
other groups]{.underline}**. [When people give strong importance to
their ethnic group]{.underline} (in relation to other ingroup members
and themselves individually), and [when they perceive other ethnic
groups]{.underline}, **[they tend to give more importance to their
ethnic group over other groups.]{.underline}** The process of social
comparison is responsible for this because through this process
individuals and groups strive for a sense of positive distinctiveness.
The sense of strong importance of the ingroup in relation to outgroups
is what we called intergroup ethnocentrism, and it has four expressions:
preference (favoring the ingroup), superiority (hyper evaluation of the
ingroup), purity(rejection of outgroups), and exploitativeness (tendency
to impinge on the rights of those who are outside the group).

## Hegemonic Stability Theory

### 2NC/2AC -- Multipolarity Now

#### A multipolar transition is coming --- increased political and economic importance of multilat institutions fills in every void 

**Rosenberg, 19** - professor at Columbia's School of International and
Public Affairs (Mark Y., \"Experts Get Multipolarity All Wrong\",
Foreign Policy, 6-24-2019,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/24/experts-get-multipolarity-all-wrong/))SK

It is certainly true that a more diffuse [distribution of power reduces
stability]{.underline}, makes anarchy more likely, and undermines the
provision of global public goods---indeed, [that is]{.underline}
effectively [an axiom of i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations. [But that doesn't mean that institutions like
the G-20 are obsolete]{.underline}. In fact, [the more **multipolarity
accelerates**, the more meaningful and relevant multilateral
institutions will become.]{.underline} This is true for two main
reasons. First, [given the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[decreased appetite for providing public goods]{.underline} (including
trade regimes, shipping lanes, and security guarantees), other powers
such as [China, Japan, Russia, and]{.underline} even [the]{.underline}
[E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [are **stepping in to fill
the void**]{.underline}. And even if the body is
[flawed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-26/g-20-is-working-on-an-endangered-species-the-summit-communique),
[the G-20 can provide critical coordination and **conflict resolution
mechanisms** for such efforts]{.underline}. Second, and relatedly, such
[forums provide]{.underline} business and markets with [critical
information about how alliances and power dynamics are shifting in a
more fluid international system]{.underline}. That's true [even if
global policymaking itself is less efficient]{.underline}. The upcoming
[Osaka summit]{.underline} should prove an excellent example. It
[offers]{.underline} a timely [opportunity to gather
together]{.underline} [every]{.underline} key external [player in the
Iran imbroglio]{.underline}, for example. [Although]{.underline} formal
[progress toward better U.S.-Iran relations is unlikely]{.underline},
[the summit will provide important signals on the potential for war and
**peace**.]{.underline} In addition, expect host and new G-20 president
Japan to coordinate anti-protectionist nations at the summit, exploiting
its star role in sustaining the (now sans-United States) Trans-Pacific
Partnership and its new EU-Japan trade deal to do so. At the very least,
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo [Abe can provide positive
atmospherics]{.underline} for a much-anticipated summit meeting
[between]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [**Trump** and]{.underline}
Chinese President **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping, [the outcome of which
could determine the fate]{.underline}, at least in the near-to-medium
term, [of the **global economy**]{.underline}. At the same time, [Trump
and]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [**Putin** are also
scheduled to meet, which is relevant not only in light of the
**breakdown of U.S.-Russian arms** treaties but also in terms of
**growing conflict**]{.underline} over Russia between the White House
and the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, [G-20 finance ministers]{.underline}
appear to have [made significant progress in agreeing to a new [digital
tax](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-g20-japan-tax/g20-agrees-to-push-ahead-with-digital-tax-communique-idUKKCN1T903D)
on multinational firms,]{.underline} a major development [in the
[growing
conflict](https://qz.com/680952/apples-uphill-battle-with-china-is-a-reminder-that-theres-no-such-thing-as-borderless-tech/)
between tech companies and the state]{.underline} that will likely be
reinforced at the approaching summit. Recent trends in U.S. and global
markets help reinforce these points. First, increasing geopolitical risk
has actually accompanied a boom in U.S. and global equity markets,
suggesting that [**declining U.S. hegemony** and growing multipolarity
is **not**]{.underline} necessarily **[bad for
business]{.underline}**---or at least for stock prices. At the same
time, markets have often turned downward around the time of recent G-20
summits. At the very least, this pattern indicates the G-20 events are
important to markets, suggesting that [developments at G-20 meetings may
wake up the market to otherwise discounted or mispriced geopolitical
risks]{.underline}. [The importance of the G-20 and bodies like it will
only grow in a more **multipolar world**]{.underline}. As rare but
institutionalized gatherings of major global political economies and
their leaders, [G-20 forums will be the place to understand shifting
alliances and power dynamics]{.underline}. [They will provide
information about major geopolitical and geoeconomic
uncertainties]{.underline}. Political and economic deals will be done
and undone; conflicts revived and resolved; grievances accelerated and
appeased[. The result will]{.underline} not be order, per se. But it
will [certainly be more order---and more information about that
order]{.underline}

### US Heg = Destabilizing -- East Asia

#### American unipolarity is uniquely destabilizing -- causes economic and strategic uncertainty especially in East Asia

**Beeson, PhD, and Broome, PhD, 10**

[The capacity to project military power abroad both relies
on]{.underline}, [and may reinforce, a]{.underline} [country's economic
strength]{.underline}. In this regard, there is no doubt that [the US
remains the most powerful country on earth.]{.underline} By any measure,
it is a force to be reckoned with---often a decisive one. Yet **[even at
the height of the much vaunted unipolar era it was sowing the seeds of
its own decline]{.underline}**. The simple reality has been that [the US
has been increasingly reliant on others to underwrite its grand
strategies and designs]{.underline}. [This would have been a problem at
the best of times]{.underline}, [but in a period of economic crisis,
**it is a major potential weakness**]{.underline} and one that has
implications for the wider international system. [Many other states were
already concerned about the dangers of American
unilateralism]{.underline} **[and the destabilising impact of US foreign
policy during]{.underline}** the presidency of George W**[.
Bush]{.underline}**. It has since become clear that [American economic
policies during the last decade have been equally catastrophic for both
the US and the international order]{.underline} of which it remains a
paramount part. Far from being a force for stability, **[the US has
become the epicentre of economic dislocation and strategic
uncertainty]{.underline}**. By any measure of hegemonic influence,
**[the bases of American authority and power have been severely
undermined]{.underline}**. It is possible that the new administration of
Barack Obama will repair some of the material damage to the global
economy and restore the ideational influence of the US as a source of
policy innovation through constructive engagement with major emerging
market economies. However, while it plainly makes a difference who is in
the White House, **[the US's historical engagement with East Asia
suggests that the basis of its relationship with the region and the
world need to be re-thought and placed on a more stable
footing]{.underline}** which minimises the dangers that flow from
overweening power and a willingness to use it for primarily national
ends. In short, , [the US ought to be encouraged to become a 'normal'
country]{.underline} one that acts more in the interests of the
'international community' in ways that reflect both its own diminishing
importance and the nature of the collective problems that face us all.
[Recent events and historical precedents suggest that
states]{.underline}---or at least a handful of the most powerful
states---**[will play a decisive role in determining future strategic
and economic outcomes]{.underline}**. In this respect, [perhaps the best
we can hope for in the short term is a revamped 'concert of powers': the
continued strengthening of a club-based international forum]{.underline}
[such as the G-20]{.underline} that includes major emerging market
economies, in which the dominant states of the era agree to cooperate
for their mutual benefit. By [exercising a form of collective hegemony
over the international economic order, the combined influence of
existing and emerging major powers may be able to foster the
international policy coordination that will be essential to containing
the aftershocks of the global credit crunch,]{.underline} at the same
time as reducing the likelihood of new economic and strategic
instability resulting from the untrammelled exercise of US power in the
future.

### 2NC/2AC -- Heg Bad -- Interventionism

#### Heg is counterproductive -- causes endless interventionism -- risks nuclear conflict

**Faris**, **19**, \[David Faris is an associate professor of political
science at Roosevelt University\], (5-17-2019, \"The dangerous myth of
American hegemony\",
https://theweek.com/articles/841854/dangerous-myth-american-hegemony,
accessed 7-19-2019), //Snitty

The Trump administration [unveiled
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/world/middleeast/us-military-plans-iran.html)
recently to send as many as 120,000 troops to Iran if American forces
are attacked or if work on a nuclear weapons program is resumed. This
stunning revelation, in the absence of any real provocation from Tehran,
has justifiably caused great alarm for anyone who doesn\'t want to see
the United States stumble into another ruinous war in the Middle East.
[It also should worry us about the overall trajectory of American
foreign policy, as the U.S. looks increasingly like it is in dangerous
decline --- drunk on vanishing power, fearful of a reshuffling of
hierarchies, and driven by emotional decision-making and irrational
fears. The United States today seems incapable of correctly appraising
how its power to coerce other actors in the international system is
diminishing.]{.underline} The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq waged this
century not only failed to achieve even the most charitable
interpretations of their objectives, [but also further destabilized the
region, empowered hostile actors like Iran, and should have confirmed
for any sane observer that the United States lacks the ability to
transform distant societies with military force. Yet]{.underline}
President [Trump\'s]{.underline} [administration]{.underline} [continues
to conduct foreign policy as if the United States is still the
undisputed hegemon of a unipolar world,]{.underline} as it was in the
decade following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Indeed, the
administration\'s general attitude seems lifted directly from \"The
Unipolar Moment,\" [a prominent Foreign Affairs
essay](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/1991-02-01/unipolar-moment)
written by the late Charles Krauthammer back in 1990. \"The center of
world power is the unchallenged superpower, the United States, attended
by its Western allies,\" he wrote. [He warned ominously of \"the
emergence of a new strategic environment, marked by the rise of small
aggressive states armed with weapons of mass destruction and possessing
the means to deliver them]{.underline},\" [and urged America to
aggressively confront them in order to maintain its dominion over the
world.]{.underline} [Both Democratic and Republican presidents over the
past 30 years have crammed their thinking i]{.underline}nto
Krauthammer\'s framework, [flipping out over the slightest provocation
from what became known as \"rogue states]{.underline},\" Iran prominent
among them, and [drawing the United States into a series of unnecessary
and disastrous conflicts]{.underline}. But the immolation of America\'s
designs in Iraq and Afghanistan [led to a revision of American hegemony
by the Obama administration --- admittedly incomplete, and haphazard,
but nevertheless meaningful efforts to extract the United States from
the Middle East and from our seemingly incurable monomania to spend
precious resources hounding and punishing poor, isolated countries with
limited capacity to harm us.]{.underline} Despite Trump\'s rhetoric
during the 2016 campaign about the stupidity of Middle East
entanglements, as president he has consciously or unconsciously returned
to the pre-Obama framework of triumphalist, unilateral arrogance,
without stopping even for a moment to consider the changed material
circumstances facing the United States. [The administration\'s failed
efforts to railroad our NATO allies, the comical inability to bring dirt
poor and isolated North Korea to heel, the humiliating impasse over the
details of trade with China, and now this farcical effort to impose
terms on the Iranians are all the follies of an over-the-hill global
power that either does not recognize the emerging limits of its
influence, or is gripped with panic over the impending erosion of
American power.]{.underline} [**Declining powers** aren\'t just
inept]{.underline}. They **[are also dangerous]{.underline}**. A
c[ountry whose power is deteriorating, particularly one that has fallen
into the hands of an unstable ignoramus who is both terrifyingly
aggressive with rhetoric and who has surrounded himself with
unreconstructed militarists, could act aggressively with both rising
challengers as well as less powerful countries like Iran. What is most
concerning about recent American foreign policy behavior is the extent
to which it may be driven by the need to settle scores before our
relative power declines any further.]{.underline} As political scientist
Jack Levy explained [in a 1988 World Politics
article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2010195?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents),
\"[The temptation is to fight a war under relatively favorable
circumstances now ... to avoid both the worsening of the status quo over
time and the risk of war under less favorable circumstances
later.\"]{.underline} America\'s bizarre obsession with Iran fits
Levy\'s framework perfectly. Terrified that the Iran Deal might lead to
an increase in Iranian power, the Trump administration set it on fire,
and has since taken a series of aggressive steps designed to ratchet up
tensions. Apart from the egregious waste of time and resources on a weak
and distant country that poses no meaningful threat to the United
States, the Trump administration\'s Iran policy is fundamentally
unworkable. The problem is actually much simpler than anyone would like
to acknowledge. The United States today lacks the power to compel Iran
to sign an agreement more favorable than the one the Trump
administration tore up last year, and more importantly it lacks the
expertise, resources, and political will to fight a protracted war.
American threats are empty, not just because the president keeps saying
in public that he doesn\'t want war, but because his goals are
unachievable. [The truth is that America is deliberately running a
trillion-dollar peacetime deficit in the middle of a decade-long
economic expansion, and recently implemented a radical tax reduction
plan.]{.underline} Fresh off [spending \$5.6
trillion](https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/11/costssummary)
despoiling Iraq and spinning our wheels in the endless Afghanistan
quagmire, the United States can ill afford to prosecute a border
skirmish, let alone a full-blown war with an enormous country of 82
million people. Not only that, but the odds of getting appropriations
for an Iran war through the House of Representatives are steep.

### 2NC/2AC -- China Rise Good

#### China rise good --- its focus on [territorial integrity]{.underline} ensures a stable international order 

**Griffiths, 16** - Associate Professor in the Department of Political
Science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs (Ryan
D., \"States, Nations, and Territorial Stability: Why Chinese Hegemony
Would Be Better for International Order\", Security Studies, 7-8-2016,
Vol. 25, Issue 3, p. 519-545))SK

China\'s acknowledgement of the external meaning of territorial
integrity is a contested topic. [The cynical view holds that a
predominant China will try to expand]{.underline} and redraw political
borders [because rising states are revisionist]{.underline} and
territorial expansion is par for the course. Such behavior would clearly
undermine the territorial integrity norm. But I contend that alt[hough
China will increasingly insist on a hegemonic relationship]{.underline}
with its neighbors, [it will do so with an eye on **preserving the
territorial integrity** of states]{.underline}. It might press its
current territorial claims, but [it would not strip states of their
sovereignty and transform them into Chinese possessions]{.underline}. My
position is built on two related arguments. First, C[hina\'s territorial
disputes are not based on claims over other sovereign
states]{.underline}, in total, [nor are the disputes over key sections
of their landmass]{.underline}. There are important disputes to be sure,
such as with India, but these do not lay claim to vital sections of the
Indian state. More importantly, [the trend has been toward
**reconciliation** rather than escalation]{.underline}. Indeed, [China
has shown a proclivity toward **negotiation**]{.underline}, especially
when it is strong. [One might challenge my argument by pointing to
Taiwan]{.underline} and arguing that China\'s territorial claim
threatens the very existence of a sovereign state. [But in this case
China actually invokes **territorial integrity** and treats **Taiwan as
an internal matter**]{.underline}. Since it has never recognized the
sovereignty of Taiwan, [its claim is framed as]{.underline} a matter of
sovereignty---an [intrastate rather than]{.underline} an
[interstate]{.underline} issue. Overall, the real flashpoints in Chinese
territorial disputes are maritime in nature, pitting it against its
neighbors over [control of sea-lanes and various uninhabited
islands]{.underline} like the Spratlys or the Senkakus/Diaoyus. These
[contests are long running]{.underline}, their rightful ownership is
debated, [and]{.underline} increased [assertiveness over them is
unlikely to challenge the territorial integrity norm]{.underline}.
Second, [China has a strong interest in **maintaining the territorial
integrity norm** and this is unlikely to change.]{.underline} Although
its chief application of the norm is aimed at internal regions, it has
to take the norm in full. [It cannot appeal to the norm in its dealings
with internal nations while also engaging in]{.underline} conquest and
[blatant territorial aggression]{.underline}. Winning the normative
argument in these internal disputes requires that it raise territorial
integrity above self-determination. [The purpose of the borders norm is
to promote stability by emphasizing the existing territorial
grid]{.underline}. In all, [China regularly invokes the
norm]{.underline}, and its full weight should continue to shape Chinese
policy regarding territory. This discussion raises the interesting
question of how the territorial status quo is determined. After all, the
government of [Taiwan rejects China\'s denial of Taiwanese
sovereignty]{.underline} on the basis of territorial integrity. [Does
this ambiguity imply that]{.underline} the norm can be stretched to
cover all claims and that [the powerful can casually determine whose
integrity is threatened]{.underline}? The answer is [**no**. The
existing territorial grid has already been determined through diplomacy,
war, and the other practices,]{.underline} both fair and unfair[, which
shape **i**]{.underline}nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations. Of
course, [conflicting claims over territory]{.underline} do exist on the
margins of that grid---Taiwan being one of the most prominent---and it
is precisely in cases such as these, where territorial integrity can be
invoked by both sides, that conflict becomes more likely. But these
cases [are limited]{.underline} in number, [rooted in history, and not
simply conjured whole cloth]{.underline}. The existing territorial grid
would shape China\'s ability to call on the territorial norm. To
conclude[, a hegemonic China ought to influence international order by
shifting the balance from self-determination toward territorial
integrity]{.underline}. It[s insistence on supporting territorial
integrity in the internal sense is significant]{.underline}, and only in
instances of consent would the state recognize independence claims. [As
such,]{.underline} the [prohibition on conquest should endure during a
time of Chinese hegemony]{.underline}, but the rate of state birth would
decrease. State [proliferation would be controlled relative to the
partly controlled international order]{.underline} that has
characterized the post-1945 period. How would a future period of Chinese
hegemony compare with the current international order or orders of the
past? I have argued that [Chinese hegemony would privilege territorial
integrity at the expense of self-determinatio]{.underline}n. The result
would be an international order that would resemble earlier periods in
some ways and be unique in others. [Sovereign norms would once again be
dominant and liberal norms would be subordinated to the right of
state]{.underline}s. One result of this shift would be a decline, if not
disappearance, in nonconsensual secession. However, since a Chinese
hegemon is likely to hold on to the territorial integrity norm,
[conquest would]{.underline} also [remain rare]{.underline}. [The
overall result would be a surprisingly stable international order, a
**Pax Sinica.**]{.underline}

It is when we examine the relationship between the two norms that we
obtain a more nuanced understanding of the tension between state and
nation. Self-determination has encouraged minority nations to seek
independence, and the principle of territorial integrity has both
enabled and thwarted them in their efforts. The enabling effect is that
post-independence security concerns no longer act as a deterrent to
obtaining
independence.[24](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)Fazal

may choose other forms of political association---such as local

saying: "We want a federal Austria. We cannot be independent outside of
Austria, next to a powerful Germany with Germans on our

norms have effects at the system level, and systemic changes that make
conquest rare, and by extension raise the odds of state survival, ought
to increase the rate of secessionism.

The negative consequence of territorial integrity is that while it has
made the international system less perilous and more attractive to
independence movements, it has simultaneously made sovereignty more
difficult to obtain. A consequence of the norm is that the community of
states has worked to preserve political boundaries, and that presents an
obstacle to secessionists who wish to alter them. Jeffrey Herbst argues
that "state boundaries have been singularly successful in their primary
function: preserving the territorial integrity of the state by
preventing significant territorial competition and delegitimizing the
norm of
self-determination."[27](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)Jeffrey

I contend that neither territorial integrity nor self-determination has
been completely consolidated (that is, the relevant actors have not
become fully socialized to them) because the two norms contradict one
another. An unrestricted acceptance of self-determination would
undermine the territorial integrity norm because minority nations would
be free to secede against the wishes of the state. Conversely, full
commitment to maintaining the existing territorial grid would invalidate
the right of secession for aspiring nations. It is on account of this
tension that the post-1945 international order has permitted a measure
of discretion when arbitrating between the right of states and that of
nations. But that discretion prevents the full internationalization of
either norm since actors are expected to balance the merits of both in
any given situation. Their application is conditional---should the state
be privileged or the nation? That conditionality prevents the
consolidation of either norm since their application often depends on a
choice of the best solution for a specific instance.

Recent events in Kosovo and Ukraine highlight the contest between
self-determination and territorial integrity, as well as the potential
for accusations of hypocrisy. Kosovo declared independence in 2008
against the wishes of Serbia, and 108 countries, including the United
States, have recognized it as a sovereign
state.[28](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)Daniel

garnering international support is regarded by many as a victory for
self-determination, and by some as the closest we have come to
recognizing a remedial right to secession in the face of human rights
abuses by the larger state. In regard to the American recognition of
Kosovo, Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice stated: "The unusual
combination of factors found in the Kosovo situation---including the
context of Yugoslavia\'s breakup, the history of ethnic cleansing and
crimes against civilians in Kosovo, and the extended period of UN
administration---are not found elsewhere and therefore make Kosovo a
special case. Kosovo cannot be seen as a precedent for any other
situation in the world
today."[29](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)Condoleeza

The product of this normative tension is an international order
characterized by a semicontrolled proliferation of states. The
international legal community has attempted to balance the norms by
specifying the conditions where minority nations have the right to
independence. The right holds when the central government gives its
consent and thus removes the home state
veto.[32](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)Pål

application of self-determination to colonized peoples was subject to
the so-called "saltwater test" and governed by the principle of uti
possedetis (as you possess), and therefore limited to first order
overseas administrative units. See Robert H. Jackson, Quasi-States:

states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, but these are ex post
determinations that in any case were not applied to all nations (for
example, Chechnya and Tatarstan). Finally, as we saw with Kosovo, the
right can hold under somewhat ill-defined circumstances when powerful
states conclude that there is cause to recognize the breakaway region.
The end result is an evolving and fuzzy set of criteria for admission to
the club of sovereign states. The gate is not wide enough to admit all
claimants nor sufficiently defined to cleanly sort out those who qualify
from those who do
not.[34](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)Øyvind

Although the postwar effort to balance these norms is born from good
intentions, the promotion of both has created an ambiguity and fuzziness
around the path to statehood. Jonathan Paquin effectively argues that
the United States balances the trade-off between territorial integrity
and self-determination by choosing the path that promotes the greatest
regional
security.[35](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)Jonathan

notes Typically, as with Kosovo, it defends the territorial integrity of
the state in question until a point is reached where security would be
greater if it switched sides and supported the self-determination
movement. It then defends that switch with various liberal arguments and
the assertion that the case in question is sui generis, or part of a
dissolved state, and not a precedent-setting event. Unfortunately, this
response to secessionism yields unintended consequences insofar as it
shapes the behavior of secessionist movements. First, aspiring nations
now have incentive to create regional
instability.[36](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)Alan

powerful international supporters can apply pressure on the central
government to remove its home state veto, as Khartoum did with South
Sudan, or treat the instance as sui generis, as with Kosovo, and simply
recognize the breakaway region against the wishes of the sovereign.

In sum, the international order since 1945 has been characterized by
semicontrolled state proliferation, where there are three defining
features. First, states have proliferated, a reversal of the trend
toward state aggregation that characterized earlier periods
(see [Figure 1](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628#f0001)).
Second, independence movements have also proliferated. Minority nations
have responded to the international climate by seeking independence, and
new secessionist movements have continued to rise and replace those who
have seceded. Third, nations sometimes secede even in the absence of
sovereign consent, and thus state proliferation is only partly
controlled. David Armitage refers to these processes as a "contagion of
sovereignty," exemplified by a proliferation of states, an increased
number of independence movements, and an attempt by existing states to
limit
secession.[39](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2016.1195628)

### 2NC/2AC -- Heg Collapse Now

#### US hegemony is [collapsing]{.underline} in on itself --- embracing [transformative politics]{.underline} is necessary ensure a [successful transition]{.underline}

[The US]{.underline} now [seems set on a course to contribute to
creating the conditions for a new era of international discord, leading
to the further **destabilisation**]{.underline} of the (neo)liberal
"world order" that it had itself co-designed and upheld, though of
course also to project and protect its own advantages, interests, and
values on a world scale. The [recently intensified historical tendencies
of increased]{.underline} [**oligarchization of wealth** and
**authoritarianization of power** are being produced by the system
itself, but threaten the stability of liberal democratic
culture]{.underline}. 13 Growing popular [discontent with the status
quo]{.underline}, and the [rise of nationalist]{.underline}, populist,
and authoritarian ideological and [political currents]{.underline}, [are
symptomatic of rising frustration]{.underline} and popular anger [with
the established "order]{.underline}" (for a discussion of the two sides
of Polanyian double movement, see Patomäki, 2014). With the anticipated
unintended effects of ongoing developments in the US and other parts of
the world, historical [preparations are now in motion that are likely to
produce]{.underline} the next major systemic crisis, or even **[global
catastrophe]{.underline}**. These [unintended consequences will be
deeply]{.underline} ~~disabling~~ \[[damaging]{.underline}\], [calling
into question the prevailing paradigm]{.underline} of (neo)liberal
"world order", [including]{.underline} its characteristic modes of
[subjectivity, practices, and institutions]{.underline}. At present, as
judged from the impressions of participants at the recent Munich
security conference in mid-February 2017, [there has emerged "a lack of
consensus even on what a liberal order is]{.underline}" (Leonard, 2017).
There is a growing perception, and increasing global comment, that the
era of **[Western liberal dominance is now ending]{.underline}**, and
that a "post-Western" world order is dawning. [Power and influence have
diffused significantly]{.underline}, through processes of globalization,
and economic expansion by "emerging powers", including the BRICS nations
and others, such as Turkey (Gray and Gills, 2016). This is a time of
high and increasing structural tension between the persistence of the
territorially bounded and sovereign nation-state system, versus the
realities of a highly transnationalized global economic system (Gills,
2000; Gills, 2011). Arguably, a Polanyian "double movement" is still in
motion, but of its "left" and "right" ideological manifestations, the
latter appears dominant, at least for the time being. The whole idea of
a world order, however, is once again contested. [The historical outcome
of this global contestation]{.underline}, both ideologically and
practically, [will turn upon how states and social forces around the
world will act and respond in the coming period of global
histor]{.underline}y. This outcome is historically indeterminate, as
reality involves complex multi-path developmental processes that can be
interwoven, or contradictory in numerous ways. Finally, in our view it
is mistaken to prematurely conclude that because historical developments
are not smooth and linear, and because many developments at present seem
dangerously regressive or chaotic, that there is no rational (and
progressive) tangential direction to world history. [We
claim]{.underline}, from a dialectical perspective, [that]{.underline}
the [rational tendency is manifested in potential toward a system that
is capable of increased reflexive self-regulation, in terms
of]{.underline} wider wholes and (contested) [common good]{.underline},
[rather than limitation to actions]{.underline} and responses
[from]{.underline} particular ([powerful) actors'
perspectives]{.underline}. [This rational tendency may manifest
itself,]{.underline} for example, [as **democratic global
Keynesianism**]{.underline}, enabling (even radical) processes of
decommodification, and new syntheses in the market/social nexus. [Such a
historical tendency in response to the present "disorder" would
constitute an emerging alternative "democratic world
order]{.underline}". [Its emergence and consolidation are historically
**contingent upon new forms of cosmopolitan transformative
praxis**]{.underline} (Hosseini, Gills and Goodman, 2016). Such a
process is also dependent upon the rationality of participating
individual actors (cf. Bhaskar, 1993, p. 91). [Thus we can anticipate
the construction of new common institutions]{.underline} (of
international cooperation and global governance) [to evolve,
in]{.underline} either **[evolutionary]{.underline}** or dialectical
**[fashion]{.underline}**, [replacing]{.underline} certain aspects of
[the authority of territorial sovereign states with more]{.underline}
adequate ([social]{.underline}, Keynesian, democratic) regional and
[global arrangements]{.underline}. [They can be anticipated in terms of
overcoming definite lacks, absences, problems, and contradictions of the
world economy]{.underline} step-by-step -- or more [drastically, through
**many institutional transformations at once**]{.underline}, [perhaps
following a future major global crisis]{.underline} or some form of
catastrophe. [As Yeats evoked us to reflect, even as "things fall
apart", "surely **some revelation is at hand**".]{.underline}

### Western Bias

#### Western academia has become infected with an [ethnocentric]{.underline} hold on truth--- be highly skeptical of their scholarship

**[alternative perspectives]{.underline}**. [Limiting the diversity of
theory we consider in]{.underline} the field of
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations [limits the
truth we can generate and **taints what knowledge we**]{.underline} do
**[produce]{.underline}**. [This is]{.underline} especially [problematic
given]{.underline} the growing importance of [knowledge as an economic
phenomenon - **as a good with value**]{.underline}. [Knowledge and
information are increasingly sources of economic worth]{.underline} and
measures of economic success. Whereas Marx proposed a philosophy of
historical materialism whereby material factors-such as productive
capacity and technology-are the sources of power and the drivers of
history, [we are likely now living in a **post-Marxist age of
informationism**]{.underline}, in which [knowledge]{.underline} and its
spread [are the most important sources of power]{.underline}. Examples
abound. A 2009 World Bank report found that a 10 percentage-point
increase in high-speed Internet connections is accompanied by an
increase in economic growth of 1.3 percentage-points. The US budget for
intelligence work has risen every year since 2006 and now sits at around
US\$80 billion per year. A recent [New York Times]{.underline} opinion
piece by Karl Taro Greenfeld [highlighted the importance of information
gleaned from]{.underline} social [media in building social and
**cultural capital**]{.underline}. If the search for truth drives
contemporary history, and [**westerners dominate the search for truth**
about international affairs]{.underline}, then much of [the world has
been unjustly prevented from participating]{.underline} in an important
world-historic and power-generating process. [Western-skewed
**i**]{.underline}nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations [scholarship
excludes much of the world from touching the benefits of the pursuit of
knowledge about the international system]{.underline}, while at the same
time [generating an **incomplete picture of world
affairs**]{.underline}. This exclusion does not seem to the result of
some intentional or malicious grand conspiracy. It would be incorrect to
argue that individual westerners are at fault. Instead, [this problem is
the result of a sort of organic growth]{.underline}, an unintentional
historical process. [It is more correct to view western dominance of
international relations theory as a disease that has **infected
academia**-and one that harms westerners as well as
non-westerners]{.underline}. The non-universality of international
relations thought prevents western theorists from arriving at good
understandings of the international system and from gaining access to
the truth. [The **ethnocentrism** at play is implicit and harmful to all
interested in the pursuit of truth, from any culture or
region]{.underline}. Despite this lack of intentionality or fault,
Robert Cox\'s insight holds: \"Theory is always for someone and for some
purpose.\" [International relations theory is by and for westerners,
even if it is not intentionally so.]{.underline}
