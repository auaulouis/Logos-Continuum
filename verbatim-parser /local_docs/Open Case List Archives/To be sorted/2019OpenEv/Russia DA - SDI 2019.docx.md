#### The plan causes Russia to fill in -- fear of China makes arms sales inevitable

As Mattis Seeks Influence In Southeast Asia" Zachary Fryer-Biggs,

[[Washington is concerned that]{.underline}]{.mark} China, in the midst
of a land grab for every rock in the South China Sea, will come to
dominate the smaller countries that rim that body of water, and that
[[Russia will become the]{.underline}]{.mark}ir [[arms dealer of
choice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[\"[They\'re going to fill in vacuums if the U.S. isn\'t
there,\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** said Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for South and Southeast Asia Joe Felter, who joined Mattis on
the trip. [\"]{.underline}We look at [[China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} as competitors[,]{.underline} and certainly
some of their [[actions]{.underline}]{.mark} should [[give]{.mark} these
countries [a reason for concern]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\"]{.mark}

U.S. officials said [Indonesia is shopping for partners, part of a
long-standing strategy to buy weapons]{.underline} from a range of
countries to keep Indonesia from becoming committed to any. But
[officials are working hard to close a big fighter
purchase]{.underline}, a deal they think could cover as many as 48
aircraft valued at \$4.5 billion. [Vietnam is also talking about more
weapons,]{.underline} although the officials said no big deals were near
completion.

Mattis\'s trip comes as [[Trump has sought to increase U.S. arms
sales]{.underline}]{.mark} to help offset trade deficits and boost the
U.S. economy. [His plan includes both changing U.S. export rules to make
it easier to sell to foreign countries and an aggressive sales pitch
overseas to buy from the U.S., already the world\'s largest weapons
exporter.]{.underline}

The Obama administration had undertaken its own push to reform the arms
export system as part of a \"pivot to the Pacific,\" but concerns about
human rights abuses slowed some sales. [The Trump administration made
its own pivot, exporting bombs to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, for
example, after the Obama team stopped delivery because of civilian
casualties in Yemen.

Trump also pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an
Obama-era trade deal that might have bolstered smaller East Asian
economies. Supporters of the pact said that easier trade with the U.S.
would give the smaller nations of the Pacific Rim more independence from
China. Trump moved to withdraw from the agreement less than a week into
his presidency.

Other countries in the deal reacted angrily to Trump\'s decision.

\"The United States is not an island,\" said New Zealand\'s then--prime
minister, John Key. \"It can\'t just sit there and say it\'s not going
to trade with the rest of the world.\"

Individual trade pacts are pending, but Trump\'s national security
strategy, released in December, indicates the administration wants to
return the focus to East Asia. The policy statement focuses heavily on
competition with China and Russia and describes the need to work closely
with allies in the region to foster economic ties to offset China\'s
growth.

Hence Mattis\'s trip.

\"That\'s a document, that\'s a paper,\" Felter told reporters.
\"Secretary Mattis, the United States secretary of defense, traveling to
Indonesia and Vietnam, dropping in on Indonesia and Vietnam demonstrates
that priority.\"

Beyond discussions about joint military training and selling weapons,
Felter said, Mattis\'s broader goal was to show smaller nations that the
U.S. remains committed to its place as the world\'s last superpower,
despite Trump\'s \"America First\" rhetoric.

\"What they want is to be reassured that the Indo-Pacific region is a
priority for the United States,\" he said. \"That we are present in the
region. That we have no intention of withdrawing.\"

[American [leadership is seen as vital in the
region]{.mark},]{.underline} partly [[because countries are concerned by
China]{.mark}\'s aggressive efforts]{.underline} to build runways and
military facilities on various contested shoals [[in the]{.mark}
**[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea.]{.underline}
This is part of China\'s attempt to claim as much territory as possible
in a shipping zone where about a third of the world\'s cargo travels,
according to some estimates.

Earlier in the trip, Mattis said he was confident that Indonesia will
want to work closely with the U.S.

\"Indonesia has its own interests and its own relations,\" he told
reporters. \"I think when two countries are democracies, they share a
lot in common right away. We\'re a democracy, Indonesia is a democracy,
and I think that is a strong bedrock for our relationship.\"

Vietnam, which has more than 1,000 miles of coastline on the South China
Sea, is particularly economically dependent on that body of water and
supports U.S. efforts to ensure free movement.

\"That\'s just the reality of geography. It doesn\'t take a Rhodes
scholar to figure that out,\" said Mattis, who landed there on
Wednesday.

He added that he planned on thanking Vietnam\'s government for helping
maintain sanctions on North Korea, with Vietnam turning away inexpensive
coal shipments that could help power its burgeoning economy.

[[Mattis arrived in Vietnam a day after Russian Defense Minister]{.mark}
Sergei Shoigu [left]{.mark} the country following a visit spent [lauding

[[Russia is currently]{.mark} in the process of [modernizing and
recapitalizing its entire arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons and
delivery systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. In February 2011, Vladimir
Popovkin, Russia\'s First Deputy Minister of Defense, announced that
Moscow would spend about \$70 billion on Russia\'s strategic nuclear
forces between 2011 and 2020. \[31\] **[[Due to the]{.mark} recent

#### Arms exports are key to Russia's defense-industrial complex and economy\-\--current defense cuts will shrink the industry

[[Armaments exports play an important role in the Russian economy. They
account for a]{.underline}]{.mark} small but [[significant share
of]{.mark} total [exports]{.mark},]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} for a substantial share of manufactured
exports. This makes the industry one of the leading sectors through
which Russia is integrated with the global economy. [Arms
exports]{.underline} continue to play an important role in
[[provid]{.underline}]{.mark}ing **[[demand for goods and services
produced by the defence-industrial complex in
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Exports]{.underline}]{.mark} are not as
important to the defence-industrial complex as they were in the 1990s,
but they [continue to help [keep production lines in service,
and]{.mark} thus [help preserve the **full spectrum** of
defence-industrial production capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}.86
[[This might become even more important in the
future]{.underline}]{.mark} if, [[as planned, defence expenditure is
further reduced]{.underline}]{.mark} from its current elevated level.87
If the scheduled reduction in spending is indeed sustained,
international arms sales would help offset reduced domestic demand.

#### Effectively funding nuclear modernization causes nuclear war with the US

[[Russia faces real challenges]{.mark} in [sustaining]{.mark} its
military [modernisation efforts, given low oil prices]{.mark}, Western
[sanctions and]{.mark} the cost of operations in [Ukraine and
Syria.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Despite]{.underline} that, [Moscow looks
set to continue]{.underline} the program. At its heart is [nuclear
weapons modernisation]{.underline}. Russia's most recent military
doctrine, released in 2014, continues to emphasise the primacy of
nuclear weapons in Russian defence policy, stating: '[[Russia reserves
the right to use nuclear weapons in response to]{.mark} a use of nuclear
or other weapons of mass destruction against her and (or) her allies,
and in the case of an aggression against her [with conventional
weapons]{.mark} [that]{.mark} would [put in danger]{.mark} the very
[existence of the state]{.mark}]{.underline}.' [Three developments
suggest a willingness by Russia to use nuclear weapons in response to
non-nuclear attacks in a manner [that lowers the threshold of nuclear
war]{.mark}. First,]{.underline} the concept of [[preventative
de-escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} is important. [A recent IISS analysis
explained de-escalation [in which limited nuclear war could be used
to]{.mark}: '...de-escalate and [terminate combat
actions]{.mark}]{.underline} on terms acceptable to Russia through the
threat of inflicting unacceptable damage upon the enemy. Such limited
nuclear use may deter both nuclear and conventional aggression.'
[Second, the integration of conventional pre-nuclear and nuclear forces
reinforces Russia's coercive power against NATO in the pre-war 'Phase
Zero' in a future regional crisis]{.underline}---for
[example]{.underline}, in [the Baltics]{.underline}. And [third, the
Russians are clearly conscious of that coercive power given their recent
nuclear signalling]{.underline} that suggests Russia continues to see
such weapons as a means of national strength. [[Russia has undertaken
sabre rattling through simulated nuclear strikes in large-scale
exercises and aggressive probing of NATO airspace with nuclear-capable
bombers]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has demonstrated the dual-role Kalibr
NK sea-launched cruise missile in deadly strikes against Syria, and
deployed dual-role Iskander short-range ballistic missiles into
Kaliningrad in a manner that was highly threatening to NATO. That has
been backed by public statements which reinforce Russia's nuclear
weapons capability and even explicit nuclear threats to NATO states,
notably Denmark. Russian nuclear forces are being swiftly upgraded with
the focus on ICBM modernisation, based on introducing the SS-27 'Yars'
road-mobile missile, and from 2018 the silo-based RS-28 'Sarmat' heavy
ICBM. Yars and Sarmat replace much of Russia's aging Soviet strategic
rocket forces with significantly more capable delivery systems. Russia's
Navy is transitioning to modern Sineva and Bulava sea-launched ballistic
missiles, on the modern Borei class SSBNs, while the Russian Air Force
is restarting the Tu-160 Blackjack production line to produce the
updated Tu-160M2 bomber that eventually will be complemented by the
'PAK-DA' advanced bomber sometime in the 2020s. The strategic nuclear
force modernisation is important but it's the integration of Russia's
conventional pre-nuclear forces with its large 'non-strategic nuclear
forces' that's of greatest significance. That's shaping Russian thinking
on the use of nuclear weapons, particularly during Hybrid Warfare, in a
way that makes the risk of a crisis with Russia much more dangerous.
Russia is increasingly focusing on the use of its nuclear forces to
enhance its ability to undertake military adventurism at the
conventional level in a manner that's highly threatening to NATO.
However the reliance on nuclear signalling, the **[[changing operational
posture of dual-role forces and concepts like 'preventative
de-escalation', increases the risk of miscalculation in a crisis that
could lead to an escalation through the nuclear
threshold.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Russian Arms market is key for Defense Industry which is declining now -- decreased presence in global arms market

**Stratfor 19** (Stratfor, an American geopolitical intelligence
platform, May 2, 2019, Accessed: July 11, 2019, Business Insider,
"Russia is one of the world\'s biggest weapons dealers, but its defense
industry is headed for trouble",
<https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-defense-industry-faces-problems-hurting-military-modernization-2019-5>)

The [[Kremlin has been striving to modernize]{.underline}]{.mark} all
branches of the Russian military, [but [the country\'s defense
[industry]{.mark} [is
struggling]{.mark}](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/russia-procurement-plans-reflect-militarys-modernization-struggles-putin)
[thanks to decreasing]{.mark} volumes of [orders]{.mark}]{.underline},
difficulties in attracting high-skilled talent and limits to its
technological capabilities.

According to recent figures, [the performance of Russia\'s [aerospace
sector is declining]{.mark} precipitously]{.underline}. In 2018, for
instance, Russian aircraft and spacecraft makers produced 13.5% less
than in 2017. And there\'s been no letup in 2019 either[: In the first
two months of the year, aerospace [output plummeted 48%]{.mark} year on
year.]{.underline}

The [decline in Russia\'s defense output [raises concerns about]{.mark}
the competitive [strength of]{.mark} Russia\'s [defense
industry]{.mark}]{.underline} in general, [whose health is
critical]{.underline} if the country is [to project itself as a military
power]{.underline} in the longer term.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov attributed the reduction in
output to a slowdown of orders for military systems, but [projections
suggest [the slowdown is not just a short-term fluctuation]{.mark}; in
fact, it\'s expected to become even worse]{.underline} in the future.

The [downturn in oil prices has taken a bite out of Russia\'s bottom
line]{.underline}, squeezing spending for the military --- all [at a
time when the country\'s [arms manufacturers]{.mark} have [lost
their]{.mark} competitive [edge in the]{.mark} [global]{.mark} arms
[market]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Together, these factors ensure
that Russia\'s defense industry will struggle to get out of its funk.

Suffering from a dearth of funds

This dire picture stands in stark contrast to [Russia\'s frequent
presentation of sensational new platforms. In reality, however, [just a
few]{.mark} of the big-ticket [weapon systems]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
such as the T-14 main battle tank or the Su-57 fighter aircraft ---
[[find buyers]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the rest remain mere prototypes.

Russia has prioritized some hardware, such as the Sarmat
intercontinental ballistic missile, due to their strategic relevance to
the country\'s overall military posture, but [[Moscow]{.mark} has
[failed to fully develop]{.mark}]{.underline} other
[[programs]{.mark}]{.underline} or only introduced them on a limited
scale.

Under [pressure from a limited government budget, [the Kremlin even
[started reducing its]{.mark} military
[spending]{.mark}](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/what-defense-cuts-mean-russias-military) in
2017]{.underline} --- a strong indicator that, despite the modernization
push, Russia\'s financial challenges are taking a toll on the country
ambitions.

Economically, the plunge in oil prices at the end of 2014 hurt Russia\'s
bottom line, depriving the country of essential revenue and forcing it
to dip into its reserves to bridge the gap. Today, more than four years
on, [Russian [oil revenues are rising, yet the]{.mark} [country is
continuing to deal with]{.mark} the [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the lean years.

Beyond that, [low revenues]{.underline} from taxes, which have forced
Russia to raise taxes and the retirement age, and [Western
sanctions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/sanctions-will-widen-russia-west-rift-2019) over
Moscow\'s activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, have shrunk the financial
pool available to military planners.

But the Kremlin\'s problems don\'t end there. [In the past,
[Russia]{.mark} has [benefited from]{.mark} its [position as a
major]{.mark} global [arms exporter to fuel]{.mark} further [military
development]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the 1990s, for example, such
[[sales were critical]{.mark} to the country]{.underline} as it faced
severe economic hardship.

[While Russia remains the world\'s second-largest arms
exporter]{.underline} (only the United States sells more[),
the]{.underline} actual [[value of]{.mark}]{.underline} those [[exports
has been decreasing]{.mark} significantly]{.underline}. Between 2014 and
2018, their total value [dropped by as much as 17%.]{.underline}

#### The plan causes Russia to fill in -- fear of China makes arms sales inevitable

As Mattis Seeks Influence In Southeast Asia" Zachary Fryer-Biggs,

[[Washington is concerned that]{.underline}]{.mark} China, in the midst
of a land grab for every rock in the South China Sea, will come to
dominate the smaller countries that rim that body of water, and that
[[Russia will become the]{.underline}]{.mark}ir [[arms dealer of
choice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[\"[They\'re going to fill in vacuums if the U.S. isn\'t
there,\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** said Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for South and Southeast Asia Joe Felter, who joined Mattis on
the trip. [\"]{.underline}We look at [[China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} as competitors[,]{.underline} and certainly
some of their [[actions]{.underline}]{.mark} should [[give]{.mark} these
countries [a reason for concern]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\"]{.mark}

U.S. officials said [Indonesia is shopping for partners, part of a
long-standing strategy to buy weapons]{.underline} from a range of
countries to keep Indonesia from becoming committed to any. But
[officials are working hard to close a big fighter
purchase]{.underline}, a deal they think could cover as many as 48
aircraft valued at \$4.5 billion. [Vietnam is also talking about more
weapons,]{.underline} although the officials said no big deals were near
completion.

Mattis\'s trip comes as [[Trump has sought to increase U.S. arms
sales]{.underline}]{.mark} to help offset trade deficits and boost the
U.S. economy. [His plan includes both changing U.S. export rules to make
it easier to sell to foreign countries and an aggressive sales pitch
overseas to buy from the U.S., already the world\'s largest weapons
exporter.]{.underline}

The Obama administration had undertaken its own push to reform the arms
export system as part of a \"pivot to the Pacific,\" but concerns about
human rights abuses slowed some sales. [The Trump administration made
its own pivot, exporting bombs to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, for
example, after the Obama team stopped delivery because of civilian
casualties in Yemen.

Trump also pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an
Obama-era trade deal that might have bolstered smaller East Asian
economies. Supporters of the pact said that easier trade with the U.S.
would give the smaller nations of the Pacific Rim more independence from
China. Trump moved to withdraw from the agreement less than a week into
his presidency.

Other countries in the deal reacted angrily to Trump\'s decision.

\"The United States is not an island,\" said New Zealand\'s then--prime
minister, John Key. \"It can\'t just sit there and say it\'s not going
to trade with the rest of the world.\"

Individual trade pacts are pending, but Trump\'s national security
strategy, released in December, indicates the administration wants to
return the focus to East Asia. The policy statement focuses heavily on
competition with China and Russia and describes the need to work closely
with allies in the region to foster economic ties to offset China\'s
growth.

Hence Mattis\'s trip.

\"That\'s a document, that\'s a paper,\" Felter told reporters.
\"Secretary Mattis, the United States secretary of defense, traveling to
Indonesia and Vietnam, dropping in on Indonesia and Vietnam demonstrates
that priority.\"

Beyond discussions about joint military training and selling weapons,
Felter said, Mattis\'s broader goal was to show smaller nations that the
U.S. remains committed to its place as the world\'s last superpower,
despite Trump\'s \"America First\" rhetoric.

\"What they want is to be reassured that the Indo-Pacific region is a
priority for the United States,\" he said. \"That we are present in the
region. That we have no intention of withdrawing.\"

[American [leadership is seen as vital in the
region]{.mark},]{.underline} partly [[because countries are concerned by
China]{.mark}\'s aggressive efforts]{.underline} to build runways and
military facilities on various contested shoals [[in the]{.mark}
**[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea.]{.underline}
This is part of China\'s attempt to claim as much territory as possible
in a shipping zone where about a third of the world\'s cargo travels,
according to some estimates.

Earlier in the trip, Mattis said he was confident that Indonesia will
want to work closely with the U.S.

\"Indonesia has its own interests and its own relations,\" he told
reporters. \"I think when two countries are democracies, they share a
lot in common right away. We\'re a democracy, Indonesia is a democracy,
and I think that is a strong bedrock for our relationship.\"

Vietnam, which has more than 1,000 miles of coastline on the South China
Sea, is particularly economically dependent on that body of water and
supports U.S. efforts to ensure free movement.

\"That\'s just the reality of geography. It doesn\'t take a Rhodes
scholar to figure that out,\" said Mattis, who landed there on
Wednesday.

He added that he planned on thanking Vietnam\'s government for helping
maintain sanctions on North Korea, with Vietnam turning away inexpensive
coal shipments that could help power its burgeoning economy.

[[Mattis arrived in Vietnam a day after Russian Defense Minister]{.mark}

#### Russian Defense Industry key to continue modernization of tactical nukes -- [deterrence doesn't check]{.underline} because they are seen as usable

Implications",
<https://www.frstrategie.org/publications/notes/russia-s-evolving-nuclear-doctrine-and-its-implications-2016-01>)

[Russia is]{.underline} acutely [conscious]{.underline}, however, [of
the [limited success of its modernization]{.mark} effort thus
far]{.underline}, the daunting [challenges to its success]{.underline}
going forward, and thus its military's continuing weakness relative to
those of the United States and NATO. [The reasons for the only partial
success of Russia's modernization program]{.underline} are several -
[not]{.underline} least of them has [been the great ambition of the
project. Russia's]{.underline} reform [effort inevitably
faces]{.underline} a major [challenge in transforming]{.underline} the
moribund and [calcified post-Soviet military of the 1990s into a modern
fighting force]{.underline}, especially with [the]{.underline}
considerably more [modest]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} possibly
[[declining]{.underline}]{.mark}, given economic realities) [[resources
available]{.mark} to Moscow than to Washington]{.underline} .
Furthermore, the Russian reform effort itself has been hobbled by
bureaucratic and cultural resistance, corruption, inefficiencies, and
other challenges . At the same time, Moscow is aware that the United
States and, to a lesser degree, its NATO allies have capitalized on the
opportunities afforded by the "Revolution in Military Affairs" to
improve their military capabilities dramatically, making catch-up
especially difficult.

The Central Role of Nuclear Weapons

Accordingly, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has continued to [[emphasize
the]{.mark} central [role of]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[nuclear
forces]{.underline}]{.mark} in its strategic and security posture . In
addition to seeing its nuclear arsenal as an important contributor to
its diminished international prestige, [it views these weapons in
practical military terms as providing a way to compensate for its
conventional weakness]{.underline} vis-à-vis NATO (and possibly China)
and as a crucial method in particular for deterring American
exploitation of its own strategic capabilities.

Following this logic, [Moscow is [undertaking]{.mark}]{.underline} an
impressive [[modernization of its nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Hans Kristensen and Robert Norris
report, "[Russia is in the middle of a broad modernization of its
strategic and nonstrategic nuclear forces]{.underline}" that involves
continued [[development]{.mark} and deployment [of]{.mark} a range of
[new missiles, platforms, and]{.mark} supporting
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [include newly modernized
road-mobile and silo-based missiles equipped with multiple independently
targetable reentry vehicles]{.underline} (or MIRVed) ICBMs (the RS-24),
plans for a new large MIRVed ICBM (the "Sarmat") to replace the SS-18,
MIRVed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) (the SS-NX-32
"Bulava"), and a range of other weapons and platforms. Russia is also
rebuilding its supporting architecture for strategic forces, such as
early warning launch detection satellites and ballistic missile early
warning radars, an architecture that had dramatically decayed after the
collapse of the USSR.

This modernization effort is motivated in substantial part by Moscow's
concern about the growing strategic offensive and defensive capabilities
of the United States. While a good deal of Moscow's complaints about
U.S. missile defense and conventional strike capabilities are likely
exaggerated and designed to retard and complicate U.S. deployment and
employment of such weapons, Russian security decision-makers also appear
genuinely fearful about the U.S. ability to leverage its combined
strategic strike and defense assets to coerce Russia. As a result,
[Moscow is [seeking to]{.mark} build and [deploy a strategic nuclear
force]{.mark}]{.underline} that is able to demonstrate clearly to
Washington that such a first-strike capability is out of reach and that
U.S. attempts to use force to disarm Russia of its strategic deterrent
would result in devastating retaliation. To this end, Russia has been
outfitting its strategic forces with systems designed to provide better
tactical and strategic warning, redundant and skip echelon command and
control functions, and new MIRVed missiles designed to penetrate
adversary defenses.

This effort is certainly of interest and of supreme importance to
Western policymakers and analysts. [Such weapons [generate serious
stability issues]{.mark}]{.underline}, cast a shadow over any potential
conflict with Moscow, and would of course [be uniquely and immensely
destructive if actually used]{.underline}. Yet Western governments are
by and large sensitive to these developments and have no genuine
interest in taking actions that would prompt their use. Both Western
[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and Russia [[understand]{.mark} that
[large-scale nuclear employment would be]{.mark}]{.underline} mutually
[[devastating]{.underline}]{.mark} and it thus appears reasonable [and
responsible to conclude that the bar for either side to initiate such a
step remains very high.]{.underline}

Russia's Interest in and Plans for Decisive Limited Nuclear Use

Less well understood but possibly [[of greater
relevance]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is]{.mark} Russia's interest
in]{.underline} and development of capabilities for
[more [limited nuclear use]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moscow is aware of its
only partial success in fielding a modern conventional military and of
that force's imperfect ability to challenge the forces of the United
States and NATO in a broader conflict as well as of the relatively
narrow relevance of its strategic nuclear forces in situations short of
the apocalyptic. This leaves a significant gap in Russia's defense
posture: left alone, [Russia's conventional forces could be decisively
overcome by NATO forces in a plausible conflict]{.underline} over, for
instance, the Baltics or other countries in Eastern Europe. Such a
scenario would likely fall considerably short of a situation in which
Moscow would see the utility in initiating a general nuclear strike
against NATO, a strike that would essentially inevitably result in a
comparable massive Western response. Russia could therefore find itself
exposed to Western coercion if this vulnerability were left unaddressed 

[To deal with this]{.underline} problem[, [Russia
has]{.mark}]{.underline} for a number of years [[seen the value]{.mark}
of seeking [to extend]{.mark} credible nuclear [deterrence down the
ladder]{.mark} of escalation [to]{.mark} scenarios [below the
extreme]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to deter the West from seeking to
exploit this potential conventional vulnerability as leverage. As
Russian expert Yuri Federov has outlined, "\[I\]n the strategic
environment since the end of the Cold War, instead of massive use of
nuclear weapons planned by the Soviets during the Cold War, [\[the\]
Russian military command \[has\] sought to develop a method of limited
use of nuclear weapons that will enable them to deter or stop \[an\]
attack of]{.underline} superior [conventional forces without
escalation]{.underline} into total nuclear exchange or large-scale
regional war." Moscow has occasionally described the objective of such
nuclear employment as "de-escalation of aggression," an approach
sometimes termed an "escalate to de-escalate" strategy." An influential
2003 official document, for instance, described "\[d\]e-escalation of
aggression" as the effort to "forc\[e\] the enemy to halt military
action by a threat to deliver or by actual delivery of strikes of
varying intensity with reliance on conventional and (or) nuclear
weapons." Russia appears to see both nuclear weapons of tailored effect
and non-nuclear but "strategic" conventional weapons as being of
potential use in such scenarios. This strategy is consistent with those
of other countries facing a potential adversary possessing stronger
conventional forces -- NATO in the Cold War and Pakistan vis-à-vis
India, for instance. In accord with this doctrine,
[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} has since the early 1990s made clear that
it [[would resort to using nuclear weapons first]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [precise conditions]{.underline} under which Moscow would employ its
nuclear weapons in this fashion [are ambiguous]{.underline} -- by
design. Official Russian statements as to when it would use its nuclear
weapons have varied. In its 2000 defense statement, for instance, Moscow
adopted a broader set of parameters for such use, apparently prompted by
the Western Alliance's awing display of force unsanctioned by the UN
Security Council in Kosovo. [This [doctrinal statement]{.mark}
explicitly [extended the]{.mark} intended [relevance o]{.mark}f Russia's
[nuclear arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline} from "global war," or a "a war
against a coalition of powerful states in which sovereignty and \[the\]
very survival of Russia are at stake," [[to "regional war,"]{.mark} with
the latter defined as "a war with a powerful state or a
coalition]{.underline} \[namely the United States and NATO\], [which
Russian forces cannot win or terminate on favorable
conditions]{.underline}." In more colloquial terms, Russia explicitly
announced that it was prepared to use nuclear weapons in a major but not
total conflict with NATO in which Russia believed it could not prevail.
[The [most recent]{.mark} (2010 and 2014) official [statement]{.mark}s
of Russia's military doctrine]{.underline}, however, [[appeared to
narrow]{.mark} Russia's declaratory [policy]{.mark} on nuclear
use]{.underline}. With the exception of retaliating against nuclear
attack, the 2010 and 2014 white papers suggested that Moscow would
confine any first nuclear use to situations of, as in the 2003 paper, "a
military conflict involving the utilization of conventional means of
attack (a large-scale war or regional war)" but also "imperiling the
very existence of the state." The last section of the statement seemed
to indicate that Russia's bar for using nuclear weapons in the face of
conventional conflict with NATO would be quite high; such a conflict
would, the statement appeared to imply, have to threaten the collapse of
the state -- an undefined but presumably extreme circumstance -- before
Moscow would reach for its nuclear arsenal.

A number of reports, [[howeve]{.mark}r]{.underline}, suggested that
[this [shift]{.mark} of public statements [was]{.mark} more
[cosmetic]{.mark} than real .]{.underline} The release of the [actual
white paper [followed]{.mark} a series of [controversial
statements]{.mark} indicating [that]{.mark} Russia]{.underline} was
continuing to adhere to a more expansive conception of the role of
nuclear weapons, and indeed that it [was even considering broadening
their writ to include "local conflicts."]{.underline} [These statements
provoked considerable controversy]{.underline} [that]{.underline} might
have [[led]{.underline}]{.mark}, for political and perceptual reasons,
[[to the]{.mark} slightly [more restrictive statement]{.mark} of the
role of Russia's nuclear forces that appeared in the final white
paper]{.underline} . A similar dynamic obtained in the lead-up to the
2014 doctrine's release in late December 2014. Buttressing this
interpretation are reports that the 2010 white paper was accompanied by
a classified annex entitled "The Foundations of State Policy in the Area
of Nuclear Deterrence until 2020," which a number of informed experts
speculate includes provisions for employment of nuclear weapons in a
wider variety of situations than stipulated in the Military
Doctrine document. It seems reasonable to assume that a similar annex
accompanied accompany the 2014 version.

Perhaps more to the point, [recent events]{.underline} and statements
from the Kremlin and other authoritative Russian sources [strongly
suggest that [Moscow envisions nuclear weapons]{.mark} [playing
a]{.mark} significant [role in a limited conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
with the West, a conflict that appears [less implausible in the wake of
Moscow's [seizure of Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}, its [continuing
[incursions into]{.mark} eastern [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, and its
[broader [posture of antagonism]{.mark} towards the West]{.underline}
and interest in revising the post-Cold War political settlement in the
areas in and around the former Soviet Union. Nor does this situation
appear likely to improve, especially with the Russian military playing
an increasing role in the Kremlin's foreign policy. Vladimir Putin and
the broader Russian leadership appear to have concluded that relations
with the West have fundamentally deteriorated and that political
confrontation will continue. It therefore appears likely that the
Kremlin will continue to view nuclear weapons as a key part of Russia's
strategy and military posture, and [will look upon them as a method of
compensating for the country's weakness]{.underline} in relation to
NATO.

#### Modernized low-yield nukes escalate to nuclear war

**Krepon 18** (Michael Krepon the co-founder of the Stimson Center,
given a lifetime achievement award for non-governmental work to reduce
nuclear dangers by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
2015, December 17, 2018, Accessed: July 10, 2019, Arms Control Wonk,
"The highly questionable case for new low-yield options",
<https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1206289/the-highly-questionable-case-for-new-low-yield-options/>)

Do new or more varied means of delivering "tactical" nuclear weapons
provide for more time and space against crossing the nuclear threshold
and, once crossed, enhance escalation control? The argument on the
"[[pro]{.mark}" [side is rooted in]{.mark} the [presumed]{.mark}
[psychology of deterring]{.mark} a nuclear-armed foe: If]{.underline}
the bad guy knows that the good guy has [[more options at the lowest
rungs]{.mark} of the escalation ladder, then the bad guy will be more
deterred]{.underline} from crossing the nuclear threshold. This would
not only provide more time and space for crossing the nuclear threshold,
but also enhance prospects for escalation control.

[This [argument is wobbly]{.mark} for multiple reasons]{.underline}. To
begin with, [[most]{.mark} of those [who seek]{.mark} more [lower yield
options]{.mark} to deter [also seek war-winning]{.mark} nuclear
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, or at least advantageous outcomes in
the event of a nuclear war. Here's Bridge Colby, for example, in the
November/December 2018 issue of [Foreign
Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-10-15/if-you-want-peace-prepare-nuclear-war):

"Washington's task is clear. It must demonstrate to Moscow and Beijing
that any attempt to use force against U.S. friends and allies would
likely fail and would certainly result in costs and risks well out of
proportion to whatever they might gain. This requires conventional
military power, but [it]{.underline} also [means having the
right]{.underline} strategy and weapons [to fight a limited nuclear
war and come out on top."]{.underline} (Emphasis added.)

[[What does it take to]{.mark} fight and [win a limited nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline} against a well-armed and well prepared foe?
Bridge has joined a distinguished line of strategists that have weighed
in on the subject of fighting a limited nuclear war.
[[None]{.mark}]{.underline} of his predecessors --- Kissinger, Nitze,
Brodie, Kahn, Wohlstetter, et. al. --- [[have offered a]{.mark} sensible
[explanation]{.mark} for success]{.underline}. Some recanted their
views. [While escalation control in a limited nuclear war is to be
fervently desired]{.underline}, the likelihood of its occurrence depends
on whether both nuclear-armed adversaries are so chastened and shocked
by witnessing mushroom clouds that they elect to seek a draw[. [If one
or both seek advantage]{.mark} or victory, [many more mushroom
clouds]{.mark} would be required, [and]{.mark} the greater the number of
mushroom clouds, [the less likely "victory" can be
claimed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Bridge has clarified to me that, in his view, "coming out on top" would
mean fighting to a draw because mutual acceptance of the status quo
ante would equate to a U.S. [[victory in]{.mark} peripheral [regions
around Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} and China. This is an important
qualifier, but it still [[presumes that escalation can be
controlled]{.mark} in a limited nuclear war]{.underline}. [Escalation
control presumes that well-armed nuclear adversaries can maintain an
intact chain of command for forces fighting on a radioactive
battlefield]{.underline}. Another critical assumption behind escalation
control is that the level of trust and lines of communication between
still-functional national command authorities in nuclear-warring states
are sufficient to enable leaders to call off additional mushroom clouds.

These assumptions are not impossible to envision but may well be heroic.
[[If]{.mark} the stakes at hand are so great and if trust or control
have broken down to the extent that [mushroom clouds have
appeared]{.mark}]{.underline} on battlefields, then [[preventing
more]{.mark} mushroom clouds [would be]{.mark} extremely
[difficult]{.mark} --- even assuming that both adversaries would accept
a draw]{.underline}. These heroic assumptions become even more far
fetched if one or both major powers seek advantage or victory rather
than a draw.

### U\-\--Russia Arms Sales Low

#### Russia's arms exports are declining

Filip **Brokeš**, **4/24**/19, \"Russia\'s declining arms exports,\"
Central European Financial Observer, Filip Brokeš is an independent
journalist with expertise in Central and Eastern Europe and Politics &
Economy.
https://financialobserver.eu/cse-and-cis/russias-declining-arms-exports/

[According to the world-renowned Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) [Russian exports of major arms decreased by 17 per
cent between 2009-13 and 2014-18]{.mark}.]{.underline} In SIPRI's latest
report titled "Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2018" Russia is
still the world's second largest arms exporter, but [[the gap between
Russia and the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been
widening in recent years]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the [US arms
exports grew by 29 per cent between the two periods, increasing share of
total global arms exports from 30 per cent to 36 per cent, [Russian
share of the global arms exports market decreased from 27 per cent to 21
per cent]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} according to the report. [[The
fall in Russia's global arms export share is]{.mark}, in part, [the
result of general reductions in arms imports by Russia's long term major
arms import partners --- India and Venezuela.]{.mark} "Although India
remained the chief recipient of Russian arms in 2014-18, Russian arms
exports to India fell by 42 per cent between 2014-18 and 2009-13. Arms
exports to Venezuela, which was the fifth largest recipient of Russian
arms in 2009-13, decreased by 96 per cent between the two
periods,"]{.underline} the report says. [[The decreasing demand for arms
by India has hit Russia particularly hard]{.mark}.]{.underline}
According to the report, India's import of arms decreased by 23 per cent
between 2009-13 and 2014-18. ["The decline in India's import is also
partly due to delays in deliveries of arms produced under license from
foreign suppliers, such as combat aircraft ordered from Russian in 2001
and submarines ordered from France in 2008,"]{.underline} according to
the India's daily Business Today. In the period between 2009-13, Russia
accounted for 76 per cent of total Indian arms imports, compared with 58
per cent in 2014-18. Besides India and Venezuela, between 2014-18,
Russia delivered major arms to 46 countries. [[More than half of
Russia's overall arms exports went to only three countries: China, India
and Algeria]{.mark}.]{.underline} "At the regional level, Asia and
Oceania accounted for 60 per cent of Russian arms exports in 2014--18,
Africa for 17 per cent, the Middle East for 16 per cent, Europe for 5.8
per cent and the Americas for 1.4 per cent," the report says.

#### Russian arms sales [and]{.underline} their defense industry are [low now]{.underline}

**Stratfor 4-29**-2019 - American geopolitical intelligence platform and
publisher founded in 1996 in Austin, Texas, by George Friedman, who was
the company\'s chairman. Chip Harmon was appointed president in February
2018. Fred Burton is Stratfor\'s chief security officer ("Russia\'s
Defense Industry Finds Itself in a Tailspin," *Strafor Worldview*,
[https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/russias-defense-industry-finds-itself-tailspin)](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/russias-defense-industry-finds-itself-tailspin)//BB)

[[Russia\'s]{.mark} defense industry is face to face with a major
foe]{.underline}, but it\'s not a foreign military power. [The Kremlin
has [been striving to modernize]{.mark} all branches of the Russian
military, [but the]{.mark} country\'s [defense industry is struggling
thanks to decreasing volumes of orders]{.mark}, difficulties in
attracting]{.underline} high-skilled [talent and limits to
its]{.underline} technological [capabilities]{.underline}. According to
recent figures, [the performance of Russia\'s aerospace sector is
declining precipitously]{.underline}. In 2018, for instance, Russian
aircraft and spacecraft makers produced 13.5 percent less than in 2017.
And there\'s been no letup [in 2019]{.underline} either: In the first
two months of the year, [aerospace output plummeted 48
percent]{.underline} year on year. [[The decline in]{.mark} Russia\'s
[defense output raises concerns about the]{.mark} competitive [strength
of Russia\'s defense industry]{.mark} in general, [whose health is
critical if the country is to project itself as a military
power]{.mark}]{.underline} in the longer term. Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Borisov attributed the reduction in output to a slowdown
of orders for military systems, but projections suggest [[the slowdown
is]{.mark} not just a short-term fluctuation]{.underline}; in fact,
[it\'s [expected to become even worse]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
future[. The downturn in oil prices has taken a bite out of Russia\'s
bottom line, squeezing spending for the military]{.underline} --- all at
a time when the country\'s arms manufacturers have lost their
competitive edge in the global arms market. Together, these factors
ensure that [[Russia\'s defense industry will struggle to get out of its
funk]{.underline}.]{.mark} Suffering From a Dearth of Funds This dire
picture stands in stark contrast to Russia\'s frequent presentation of
sensational new platforms. In reality, however, just a few of the
big-ticket weapon systems --- such as the T-14 main battle tank or the
Su-57 fighter aircraft --- find buyers, as the rest remain mere
prototypes. Russia has prioritized some hardware, such as the Sarmat
intercontinental ballistic missile, due to their strategic relevance to
the country\'s overall military posture, but Moscow has failed to fully
develop other programs or only introduced them on a limited scale.
[Under pressure]{.underline} from a limited government budget[, [the
Kremlin even started reducing its military spending]{.underline}]{.mark}
in 2017 --- a strong indicator that, despite the modernization push,
Russia\'s financial challenges are taking a toll on the country
ambitions. Economically, the plunge in oil prices at the end of 2014
hurt Russia\'s bottom line, depriving the country of essential revenue
and forcing it to dip into its reserves to bridge the gap. Today, more
than four years on, Russian oil revenues are rising, yet the country is
continuing to deal with the consequences of the lean years. Beyond that,
low revenues from taxes, which have forced Russia to raise taxes and the
retirement age, and Western sanctions over Moscow\'s activities in
Ukraine and elsewhere, have shrunk the financial pool available to
military planners. Low oil prices, declining revenues from taxes and
Western sanctions have taken a chunk out of the financial pool available
to Russia\'s military and the broader defense industry. But the
Kremlin\'s problems don\'t end there. [In the past, Russia has benefited
from its position as a major global arms exporter to fuel further
military development. During the 1990s, for example, such sales were
critical to the country as it faced severe economic
hardship]{.underline}. While [Russia remains the world\'s second-largest
arms exporter (only the United States sells more), the actual value of
those exports has been **decreasing significantly**]{.underline}.
Between 2014 and 2018, their total value dropped by as much as 17
percent. Again, budgetary limits are somewhat to blame: [[In the past,
Russia frequently used arms exports as a political
tool]{.underline}]{.mark}, offering weapons at a heavy discount, if not
entirely free. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} with Russia no longer able to
offer customers a good deal on its fighter jets and other defense
products, [[the country is **losing business**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Russia arms exports are declining due to US relations with the Middle East, and Russia is seeking ties with Middle Eastern countries

Alexey **Khlebnikov**, **4/8**/19, \"Russia looks to the Middle East to
boost arms exports,\" Middle East Institute, Alexey Khlebnikov is an
expert on the Middle East at the Russian International Affairs Council.
https://www.mei.edu/publications/russia-looks-middle-east-boost-arms-exports

[According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's
(SIPRI) recently published annual report, [Russia's share of global arms
exports shrank by around one-fifth over the last decade, falling from 27
percent to 21 percent]{.mark}, while [the U.S.]{.mark} share [increased
from 30]{.mark} percent [to 36 percent, widening the gap]{.mark} between
the two major arms exporters. [As Russia looks to reverse this decline,
it is focusing on the Middle East,]{.mark} the world's second-largest
and fastest-growing arms market, as a way to boost its
exports.]{.underline} While it is early days, the effort seems to be
paying off so far. According to Russian media reports, [[Russia and
Egypt recently signed a new arms deal worth at least \$2
billion]{.underline}]{.mark}. This deal, which involves [the purchase of
over 20 4++ generation Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets (Flanker-E), makes
Egypt a major importer of Russian arms]{.underline} and comes on top of
previous deals between the two countries for tens of MiG-29 jets, Ka-52K
helicopters, and coastal defense units. [[In addition to the deal with
Egypt, Russia is also moving ahead with the sale of]{.mark} the S-400
[anti-aircraft system to Turkey]{.mark} in yet another confirmation of
Moscow's growing focus on the Middle East]{.underline}. Whether this
shift will be enough to compensate for the broader decline in Russia's
global market share, however, is another question entirely. For their
part, Russian officials have pushed back against this narrative,
refuting SIPRI's analysis. They argue that in recent years the volume of
Russian arms exports has actually increased and its portfolio of orders
reached a record \$51 billion in 2018. That said, it is important to
note that SIPRI aims to define trends in global arms transfers and
calculates volumes based on the military value of the equipment rather
than its market price. As a result, even if Moscow did reach a record in
2018, the broader trend of a declining Russian share of the global arms
market is still quite clear. A downward trend: Exports in decline What's
driving this trend? Global political and economic developments --- and
their negative impact on Russia's ability to secure new arms deals ---
may be a partial explanation. The confrontation between Russia and the
West, which was exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis in 2014 and Moscow's
subsequent campaign in Syria, plays an important role in this regard.
Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its European allies may eventually
hamper Russia's ability to sign new arms contracts, and for now the U.S.
seems set on using them to ramp up pressure on Russia. In August 2017
U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Countering America\'s Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which aims to punish Moscow for its
malign actions. Under the legislation, countries trading with Russia's
defense and intelligence sectors can face secondary sanctions. Rostec, a
state corporation that brings together all the major producers of
defense and high-tech products, is on the CAATSA list, which means U.S.
policy changes can have a significant impact on its exports, especially
to countries that have military-technical agreements with Russia. In
this context, the Kremlin faces more uncertainty and risks in the arms
exporting business. [Washington has already imposed secondary sanctions
on Beijing over its purchase of Russian Su-35 fighter jets and S-400
systems. This established a precedent and sent a clear signal to Russian
partners that the U.S. might impose sanctions on them as well. In fact,
it puts many countries at risk, including]{.underline} long-time
partners of Moscow, like India, Egypt, and Algeria, as well as [those
with which it has recently begun to develop military-technical ties,
such as Turkey, Vietnam, Pakistan, Qatar, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia, and the UAE. As a result, [changes in U.S. economic and
political relations with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, or the UAE, for
example, can end up having a major impact on Russia's export
capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, it was unclear whether
Russia and India would manage to sign a contract on S-400 deliveries
because of U.S. pressure. In the end, the two partners were able to find
a solution and inked a \$5.4 billion deal, but only after India received
a presidential waiver from the U.S. And just because India was able to
find a solution, that doesn't mean there won't be issues with other
contracts and clients. For now Russia's biggest deals are with Egypt
(helicopters, fighter jets, coastal defense systems, and more),
Indonesia (Su-35 jets), Iraq (T-90s tanks), and Vietnam (T-90s tanks).
[[The Gulf Cooperation Council states are also interested in Russian
weapons]{.mark}, and Russia is expected to begin delivering the S-400
system to Turkey, a NATO member, later this year.]{.underline} Although
the Russia-Turkey contract for the S-400 missile system has been
presented by both sides as a done deal, it still seems uncertain. So
far, Ankara hasn't listened to U.S. requests to drop the deal, and
Washington has recently moved to take more aggressive action, suspending
Turkey's participation in the F-35 program. It is unclear what
additional steps the U.S. is prepared to take vis-à-vis its ally, but in
the end the fate of the Moscow-Ankara deal will determine what happens
with other potential partners in the Middle East, like Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, and Qatar, as well as elsewhere. The same applies to the new
Russia-Egypt contract for Su-35 fighters. Egypt is among most important
U.S. partners in the region and its continuous interest in Russian arms
annoys Washington. However, it seems unlikely that the U.S. will
sanction Egypt given the weak state of its economy; such a move would
also present political issues and would undermine the position of
Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. That said, [[the U.S. has the
capacity to effectively influence its partners' behavior and to limit
Moscow's opportunities to expand its share of the arms market in the
most attractive regions:]{.mark} The Middle East and Asia.]{.underline}
However, if the U.S. continues exerting pressure on its partners over
Russia, it runs the risk of provoking increasing opposition. Moreover,
it is unclear what mechanisms Washington is going to use to implement
secondary sanctions or what incentives it could offer its partners to
stop cooperating with Russia. Otherwise, [the U.S. will need to act
against its partners, which might end up having the opposite effect,
prompting them to seek closer ties with Moscow as a counter-balance to
excessive U.S. pressure.]{.underline} Regional demand: The growing
Middle Eastern market Although Asia and Oceania remain the world's
largest arms market, accounting for 40% of total imports, countries in
the region have started to import less. By contrast, across the Middle
East, the demand for arms is only expected to grow, driven by ongoing
conflicts (such as those in Syria, Yemen, and Libya), the fragile
security situation, and the threat of military confrontation between
state and non-state actors. According to SIPRI, over the last decade the
region's arms imports grew by 75% from 20% of the global total in
2009-13 to 35% in 2014-18. Russia is not alone in looking to the Middle
East as a source of growth, however. Indeed, as the most attractive and
lucrative arms market, the Middle East attracts all the major arms
exporters and the competition is fierce. At present, Middle Eastern
countries import only 10% of their arms from Russia, while 54% comes
from the U.S. and 9% from France. Therefore, Russia's presence in the
market is quite limited, although it is growing thanks to the Kremlin's
outreach to regional arms importers. In last year's SIPRI report Russia
was not even in top three arms exporters to the region. [As it looks to
ramp up its exports, Moscow is highly dependent on the broader political
and economic situation in the Middle East. Given the fact that the
majority of the regional actors --- Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE, Qatar,
Turkey, Jordan, and Kuwait --- are U.S. allies and importers of American
arms, Russia finds itself in a very tricky situation.]{.underline}
European exporters are also ramping up their regional presence. In
recent years, the leaders of the European arms industry --- France,
Germany, the UK, and Italy --- increased their share of the global arms
market by boosting their exports to the Middle East. France is the major
Russian competitor in Egypt, which imports 37% of its arms from France
against 30% from Russia. In this sense, Egypt plays both sides, trying
to diversify its suppliers: In 2015 Cairo signed a deal with Moscow for
50 Russian MiG-29 fighters as well as with Paris for 24 Rafale jets.
Algeria, a long-time major customer, imported 66% of its arms from
Russia in 2014-18, although imports from Germany account for 10% of its
total as well. The current political turmoil in Algeria might well
result in a change in Russia's market share and a shift in favor of
European producers. The UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey --- where
Russia is currently seeking new contracts --- also import a significant
share of their arms from the U.S. and European suppliers. Therefore,
[Russia's position in the regional and global arms market is getting
more complicated and difficult given Moscow's declining share of total
exports, decreasing imports in Asia and Oceania, and rising competition
in the Middle East.]{.underline} In addition, growing U.S. pressure on
Russia via its secondary sanctions puts Moscow in a very challenging
situation that will make it harder to sign big new contracts and
increase its arms exports. [[Despite]{.mark} all of these [difficulties
Moscow is working hard to get new deals,]{.mark} both [in the Middle
East]{.mark} --- the world's fastest-growing and the most attractive
arms market --- and elsewhere, as part of a broader effort to maintain
its status as a leading arms supplier. However, given the geopolitical
headwinds and intense competition, maintaining that status looks like it
will be an increasing challenge in the years ahead.]{.underline}

According to the world-renowned Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) [Russian [exports]{.mark} of major arms [decreased by
17 per cent]{.mark}]{.underline} between 2009-13 and 2014-18.

In SIPRI's
latest [report](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-03/fs_1903_at_2018_0.pdf) titled
"Trends in International Arms Transfers, 2018" Russia is still the
world's second largest arms exporter, but [the [gap]{.mark} between
Russia and the United States [has been widening]{.mark} in recent years.
While the US arms exports grew by 29 per cent between the two periods,
increasing share of total global arms exports from 30 per cent to 36 per
cent, [Russian share of]{.mark} the global arms [exports]{.mark} market
[decreased from 27]{.mark} per cent [to 21 per
cent]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to the report. The fall in Russia's
global arms export share is, in part, the result of general reductions
in arms imports by Russia's long term major arms import partners ---
India and Venezuela.

"Although [India remained the chief recipient of Russian]{.underline}
arms in 2014-18, [[Russian arms exports to India fell by 42 per cent
between 2014-18]{.mark} and 2009-13. Arms exports to Venezuela, which
was the fifth largest recipient of Russian arms in 2009-13, decreased by
96 per cent between the two periods]{.underline}," the report says. The
[[decreasing demand]{.mark} for arms [by India]{.mark} has [hit]{.mark}
Russia particularly [hard]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the report,
India's import of arms decreased by 23 per cent between 2009-13 and
2014-18.

"The decline in India's import is also partly due to delays in
deliveries of arms produced under license from foreign suppliers, such
as combat aircraft ordered from Russian in 2001 and submarines ordered
from France in
2008," [according](https://www.businesstoday.in/top-story/russian-arms-exports-to-india-sank-by-42-between-2014-18-and-2009-13-says-report/story/326773.html) to
the India's daily Business Today. [In the period between 2009-13,
[Russia accounted for 76 per cent of]{.mark} total [Indian arms imports,
compared with 58 per cent in 20]{.mark}14-[18]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Besides India and Venezuela, between 2014-18, Russia delivered major
arms to 46 countries. [More than half of Russia's overall arms exports
went to only three countries: China, India and Algeria]{.underline}. "At
the regional level, [[Asia]{.mark} and Oceania [accounted for 60 per
cent of Russian arms exports]{.mark} in 2014--18]{.underline}, Africa
for 17 per cent, the [Middle East for 16 per cent]{.underline}, Europe
for 5.8 per cent and the Americas for 1.4 per cent," the report says.

### U\-\--US Leads Arms Sales

#### Russia is Behind the US in Arms Exports

[[According to data]{.underline}]{.mark} from SIPRI, [Russ[ia accounted
for nearly 21 per cent of global arms sales in
2016]{.mark}]{.underline},16 [[ranking behind]{.underline}]{.mark} only
[[the US]{.underline}]{.mark} by material scale of exports. Russia's
prominence in global arms markets is not a new development. [[Between
2000 and 2016, the country was responsible for an annual average of 25
per cent of global export]{.underline}s]{.mark} (see Figure 1). In some
years, most recently in 2013, the value of Russia's arms exports even
surpassed that of the US's. While countries like China, Germany, France
and the UK are also significant arms exporters, they remain well behind
Russia and the US in terms of the volume of arms exported. This makes
armaments exports one of the few areas of manufacturing in which Russia
can be considered a world leader. Moreover, this strong performance
looks set to continue, with export orders of \$45--50 billion reported
to be on the books.17

#### US pressure is whittling away at Russians arms markets now

International Affairs Council (Alexey, "Russia looks to the Middle East

https://www.mei.edu/publications/russia-looks-middle-east-boost-arms-exports)

Therefore, Russia's position in the regional and global arms market is
getting more complicated and difficult given Moscow's declining share of
total exports, decreasing imports in Asia and Oceania, and rising
competition in the Middle East. In addition, [[growing U.S. pressure on
Russia via its secondary sanctions puts Moscow in a very challenging
situation]{.mark} that will make it harder to sign big new contracts and
increase its arms exports]{.underline}. [[Despite all of these
difficulties Moscow is working hard to get new
deals]{.underline}]{.mark}, both in the Middle East --- the world's
fastest-growing and the most attractive arms market --- and elsewhere,
[[as part of a]{.mark} broader [effort to maintain its status as a
leading arms supplier]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [given the
geopolitical headwinds and intense competition, [maintaining that status
looks like it will be an **increasing challenge** in the years

#### The US will expand the Recapitalization Incentive Program, or *[RIP]{.underline}*, now to poach Russian clients \-\-- eats away at their market share

security. He has been covering defense and national security issues for
more than a decade, previously as Pentagon correspondent for Defense
News (Marcus, "US: We'll Pay Countries to Ditch Russian, Chinese Arms,"
*Defense One*,
https://www.defenseone.com/business/2019/05/us-countries-well-pay-you-ditch-russian-chinese-arms/157084/)

The State Department wants to go global with a program originally aimed
at ex-Warsaw Pact members. [[The U.S. State Department wants to
expand]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline} little-known [[effort that offers
countries cash to buy American-made weapons if they give up Russian-made
arms]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The year-old initiative]{.underline}, called
the European Recapitalization Incentive Program, [is [already helping
six eastern European countries buy new helicopters or armored vehicles.
Now, State Department officials are looking to take the effort
global]{.mark} to get allies and partners to abandon]{.underline} not
only [Russian weapons]{.underline}, but Chinese ones too. "[The goal is
to help our partners break away from the Russian supply
chain]{.underline} \[and\] logistics chain that allows Russian
contractors and service personnel and Russian-manufactured spare parts
onto either NATO allied bases or partner military bases," a State
Department official said this week. [The effort comes at a
time]{.underline} as military officials across the Potomac River at the
Pentagon talk [about great power competition between the U.S. and
Russia]{.underline} and China. [[To get the money, countries must get
rid of their Russian weapons, promise not to buy new ones, and commit
some of their own funding to buying American]{.underline}]{.mark}.
"[It's meant to incentivize partners and allies to put in their own
funds to modernize their military and divest Russian legacy
equipment]{.underline}," the State Department official said. "The idea
being, we can put in some U.S. grant military assistance. They would
then put in some amount of partner military \[funding\]." The idea is to
start the foreign country toward buying a substantial number of whatever
weapons are needed. "We're going to build at least an initial amount,"
the official said. "We're not just going to buy them one helicopter or
two infantry fighting vehicles." The American cash flows through a
Foreign Military Financing account. "We're not using U.S. taxpayer money
to completely buy this for a partner," the official said. "This is going
in with our partner together to build an overarching capability." The
countries already approved for funding have militaries that use
Soviet-era helicopters and infantry fighting vehicles, according to the
International Institute of Strategic Studies' Military Balance. In some
cases, if a country buys parts for these vehicles and helicopters, they
could face U.S. sanctions. Since the program began about a year ago, the
State Department has pledged \$190 million for six projects in six
countries. The countries are in different stages of buying the new
equipment and State Department officials believe it could take a few
years until the partner nations are able to move ahead with the
purchases. The countries include: Albania, \$30 million for helicopters
Bosnia, \$30.6 million for helicopters Croatia, \$25 million for
infantry fighting vehicles Greece, \$25 million for infantry fighting
vehicles North Macedonia, \$30 million for infantry fighting vehicles
Slovakia, \$50 million for helicopters The Macedonian government touted
the effort as "strengthening the capacities" of its army by improving
its equipment and bringing it in line with NATO standards. State is
looking at a second round of initiatives with potential for \$50 to
\$100 million for new projects, the official said. Even though the
effort is still considered in a pilot or test phase, [the State
Department's fiscal 2020 budget proposal calls for expanding the
effort[. U.S. officials are also looking at how to expand the initiative
beyond Eastern Europe "to compete against Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}
and China [and help our partners get away or stay away from
Russian]{.underline} or Chinese [equipment]{.underline}." While
[State]{.underline} has not yet identified countries outside of Europe,
it['s]{.underline} [exploring countries in Central Asia, Southeast Asia
and Africa]{.underline}.

#### Peeling off [even a few]{.underline} clients collapses the Russian defense-industrial-base [absent new markets]{.underline}

Weapons: The Virtues of an Uncompetitive Market," *Ethics &
International Affairs*, 31.4)

Thanks to its large domestic consumption and numerous export deals, the
United States is shielded from dependence on and demands by its clients
in ways undreamed of by any other arms exporter. [Other
weapons-exporting countries rely on relatively fewer
buyers]{.underline}, which means they enjoy less influence over clients,
feel more pressure to transfer technology, and engage in more corruption
to make sales. In his definitive book on the global arms trade, Keith
Krause lays out the consequence of these forces on "[second-tier
producers,]{.underline}" which "are much more prone to sacrifice or
dilute their technological lead in order to maintain their productive
base, and [are]{.underline} much more [reliant upon export
opportunities]{.underline}. They are therefore less likely to demand
end-use restrictions, and hence reliance may not translate into
dependence." Unsurprisingly, [[the United States has the most diverse
export portfolio in the world]{.underline}.]{.mark} Its two biggest
customers, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, account for 13
percent and 9 percent of all U.S. arms deliveries since 2012,
respectively. Another thirteen heterogeneous states account for 3-6
percent each. More surprisingly, [[Russia, despite being the second
largest global supplier of weapons, sells weapons to a **very small**
group of buyers]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, 39 percent of its
exports go to India, and 11 percent each go to Vietnam and China.
Similarly, China sends 63 percent of its arms exports to only three
countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. **[[A shift
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** any **[[one country]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[away]{.underline} [from]{.underline} Chinese or [Russian imports [would
be devastating for its]{.mark}]{.underline} respective
[[industry]{.underline}]{.mark}, leaving buyers largely in the driver's
seat, demanding lower prices, more bribes, and larger technology
transfer. In contrast, European suppliers have a relatively diverse
group of client states, if not quite as broad as the United States. That
said, nearly half of recent British exports have gone to Saudi Arabia.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - [[Economic growth in Russia slowed in the first

in Russia arose after data showed that the pace of GDP expansion had
unexpectedly climbed to a six-year high in 2018. That also brought
concerns about the reliability of Russia's data. In March alone, GDP
grew by 0.6 percent compared with a year ago after expanding by 1.4
percent in February, the data showed. "[[The big picture is that Russian

<https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/dubai-air-show/2017/11/09/sales-target-russia-sets-its-sights-on-the-middle-east/)>

The view from Moscow

[[Russia's arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Middle East do not
take place in a vacuum. While driven by defense industry interests, they
[[are]{.mark} seen in Moscow as [part of a broader Russian effort to
reassert itself as a player of major consequence]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Russia's expert community likes to talk of an emerging multipolar world
order, and Moscow in many ways tries to act as if that is already the
case]{.underline}. But it is difficult to attribute any strategy to its
actions. "Russia is not seeking to displace the U.S. in the Middle East,
just cut it down to size," says Vladimir Frolov, an independent Russian
foreign affairs analyst. "[Russia sees [weapons sales]{.mark} as
additional leverage and a tool to [create dependency on
Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Sales]{.underline}]{.mark} to the Gulf,
particularly to Saudi, [[are]{.mark} seen as [a tool for]{.mark} other
[foreign policy objectives, to facilitate agreements on political issues
and create stakeholders in relations with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}."
While arms sales are certainly seen by the government as tools in a
larger game, the arms trade in Russia is a little more complicated than
that. "To a great extent these deals are often worked out
independently," according to CAST's Andrey Frolov. "For example,
deliveries to Syria are handled by the Defense Ministry and taken from
military stores. The state export agency Rosoboronexport has nothing to
do with this." This jibes with the sometimes diffused nature of
decision-making in Russia. Contrary to common perception, Putin does not
preside over everything that happens. He sets the general tone and path,
and hundreds of officials below him try to interpret and act according
to perceived wishes. This makes dealing with Russia difficult, but it
also makes formulating and pursuing broad strategy difficult for the
Kremlin. As far as Russia's competition with the U.S. in the Middle East
arms trade goes, the situation was best described by independent analyst
Vladimir Frolov: "[[Russia's strategy in weapons sales is to sell
everything to everyone with]{.mark} little geopolitical consideration
and [zero human rights concern]{.mark}]{.underline}. And **[[Russians
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** [try to]{.underline} [[**seize every
opportunity** where the U.S. is seen as an unreliable
partner]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Egypt]{.mark} [and Turkey
are]{.mark}]{.underline} just the most [[recent]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[examples]{.underline}]{.mark}."

[When countries prefer Russian weaponry over American systems, it is
usually for]{.underline} evident reasons. [[The US will not
sell]{.underline}]{.mark} weapons [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} many of
[[Russia's clients]{.underline}]{.mark} for a variety of reasons.
[[Russian weaponry is relatively inexpensive and]{.underline}]{.mark},
generally speaking, often [[more robust than comparable American
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. In some areas, Moscow's systems lag
severely behind the US in terms of quality and capabilities, but in
others, it is a near-peer competitor. For instance, [Moscow is quite
good at building anti-aircraft missiles]{.underline}, such as the S-300
and S-400 systems, based on lessons-learned from the Kosovo Air War. The
American F-35 joint strike fighter can likely currently beat an S-400
(although there is no way to know for sure unless they engage in direct
combat). However, [Moscow is developing the next generation, the
S-500]{.underline}, whose full capabilities are unknown. [[Russian
current-generation aircraft and ballistic missile defenses are on par
with those of the US]{.underline}]{.mark} in terms of defense
technology. [Some Russian missiles have as long a range as American
missiles, a few of them even longer]{.underline}. \[xiv\] In addition,
the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system is very slow, bureaucratic

Formulating an effective response to Russia's global activism will be
challenging. To do so, U.S. policymakers should consider four broad
points: Ask the first-order question. How do Russia's actions affect
U.S. interests and foreign policy goals? In some areas, Russian
activities have damaged U.S. interests, but elsewhere their impact has
been symbolic rather than substantive. Russian activity should not be
conflated with Russian success. Weigh costs and benefits. Russia's
approach has had mixed results. Its investments in the Middle East have
paid off handsomely. But in Europe, Russian actions have mobilized
Western governments to counter them. Notably, Moscow has fewer resources
than the West, serious domestic problems, and no real allies. Avoid
overreacting. Not every instance of Russian activism threatens the
U.S.-led international order or U.S. security. At a minimum, Washington
and its allies should expose Moscow's tactics. More robust responses are
justified when important U.S. and allied interests are threatened---and
when Washington has realistic, sustainable means to thwart Moscow's
ambitions without exacerbating the situation. Leverage partnerships and
eschew a one-size-fits-all approach. There is no cookie-cutter solution
for countering Russian adventurism. Washington need not bear this burden
alone; it should develop tailored strategies with other actors to deter,
contain, and, if necessary, roll back Russian influence operations.
INTRODUCTION For much of the post--Cold War era, the United States and
Europe paid little attention to Russia's efforts to expand its
political, economic, and military influence abroad. The West saw these
efforts as relics of the Cold War, primarily confined to Russia's
immediate neighborhood but largely absent or at least ineffective
elsewhere. The effects of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's
internal challenges, and Moscow's stated desire for integration with the
West sharply constrained the Kremlin's interest and capacity to project
its influence on a global scale and diminished the West's interest in
Russian foreign policy and its global activities. However, since
Vladimir Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012 after a
four-year stint as prime minister, Russia has engaged in a broad,
sophisticated, well-resourced, and---to many observers---surprisingly
effective campaign to expand its global reach. To advance its diverse
objectives, Moscow has relied on a wide array of diplomatic, military,
intelligence, cyber, trade, energy, and financial tools to influence
political systems, public attitudes, and elite decisionmakers in Europe,
the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These objectives
include, first and foremost, undermining the U.S.-led liberal
international order and the cohesion of the West; enhancing Putin's
domestic legitimacy by demonstrating Russia's status as a global
superpower; promoting specific Russian commercial, military, and energy
interests; and tweaking the United States' nose in areas of traditional
U.S. influence. Russia has engaged in a broad, sophisticated,
well-resourced, and---to many observers---surprisingly effective
campaign to expand its global reach. The Kremlin launched this campaign
in response to the 2012 mass protests in Moscow, apparently convinced
that Western democracy promotion initiatives had instigated these
demonstrations to destabilize Russia itself and promote regime change.1
In 2014, following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the start
of its undeclared war in Ukraine, this counteroffensive intensified and
took on new qualities. Whereas previously the bulk of Russian efforts
had focused on defending Moscow's claimed "sphere of privileged
interests" around its periphery, the new campaign has sought to damage
the international image of Western democracy, exacerbate the internal
tensions within Western political and security institutions, and expand
Russia's global reach at the expense of Washington and its allies by
playing on Western missteps in different parts of the world. [[For the
first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the United States is
facing a]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that is not, in
former president Barack Obama's memorable phrase, a mere "regional
power," but rather one [[that is actively trying to project its
influence]{.mark} and establish a presence well beyond its
periphery]{.underline}.2 Despite Moscow's shift in strategy, the United
States and its European partners are increasingly focused on their own
domestic challenges and regional crises in Asia and the Middle East.
[[Russia is keen to **exploit** increased opportunities in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting **[[vacuum]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
using both hard and soft power, [to expand its influence and presence
and to take advantage of]{.underline} Donald Trump's presidency, marked
by his embrace of an "America First" foreign policy and:3 [a retreat
from]{.underline} long-established [U.S. leadership]{.underline} in
upholding the rules-based international order Washington helped create
after World War II; an abandonment of democracy promotion and rule of
law as elements of U.S. foreign policy; a return to isolationism and a
rejection of nation-building efforts to redirect U.S. resources needed
at home; a dismissal of multilateral cooperation and a devaluation of
long-standing U.S. alliances; the worst domestic political crisis in the
United States in many decades; and, most importantly, a refusal to
acknowledge the challenge posed by Russian adventurism. [Finding
examples of Russian global activism is easy]{.underline}. Assessing its
motivations, consequences, and effectiveness is not. Specifically, it
can be hard to tell whether a given Russian behavior is meant to
actively undermine the liberal political and economic order that has
flourished under U.S. leadership or whether it is designed primarily to
shore up Putin's domestic standing and to create timely economic
opportunities for domestic Russian constituencies that support his
regime. Likewise, framing a coherent and effective U.S. response to
Russia's increased global activism will be challenging. The risk of
doing too much or too little is real, and getting the answer right
entails asking a series of challenging questions. Is Moscow's behavior
largely symbolic or does it threaten the interests of the United States
or its closest allies? What is the cost to U.S. interests of Russia's
efforts to gain geopolitical and economic toeholds beyond its immediate
neighborhood? When should Russian actions trigger a strong U.S.
response? Which Russian activities may risk overreach and pushback? What
are the best ways to measure the impact---both in Russia and the
West---of Moscow's recent global activism? Finding examples of Russian
global activism is easy. Assessing its motivations, consequences, and
effectiveness is not. Identifying the key drivers of Russia's global
activism and providing an overview of Moscow's many efforts to expand
its global influence is a useful and important way to begin formulating
appropriate and effective responses to these behaviors. In some areas,
Russian activities have damaged Western interests, but in others their
impact has proven to be more symbolic than substantive. Not every
far-flung Russian initiative should be viewed as part of a global
zero-sum competition between the United States and Russia, and the costs
to Russia of some of these efforts could exceed the benefits Moscow
hopes to gain. Policymakers should seek to assess the interests that a
given Russian behavior is seeking to advance, which policy tools Moscow
is employing, which U.S. interests are being undermined, and which U.S.
policy tools would constitute the most effective response. THE WEST AND
THE REST Russia's global activism can be divided into four geographic
regions. While there may be some uncertainty about the drivers at play
in each of these regions, there is little uncertainty about the
considerable momentum behind these efforts. In general, Moscow's
ordering of priorities aligns closely with the proximity of the region
to Russia, as well as with Russian threat perceptions. First are
Moscow's efforts to retain its influence or counter Western influence in
the states of the former Soviet Union. In its immediate periphery,
Moscow aims to firm up its hold on its neighbors to prevent additional
countries from aligning too closely with the West, and to preserve a
buffer zone of pro-Russian or, at least, neutral states around it. In
countries that have already turned away from Russia---Georgia, Moldova,
and Ukraine---Moscow seeks to undermine their political transitions,
court their publics, and prevent their true integration with Western
political, economic, or security structures. Moscow also is keen to
shore up its influence in Central Asia, a region increasingly dominated
economically by China. The second category consists of Moscow's efforts
to undermine the Western and transatlantic institutions it considers its
principal adversaries---the United States, the European Union (EU), and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Moscow has attempted to
exploit their internal divisions and challenges as well as the
uncertainty about Washington's commitment to its allies and partners
since President Donald Trump's embrace of the "America First" agenda.
Moscow's anti-Western actions are motivated by a widely held view in the
Russian security establishment that the administrations of former
presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush actively sought to weaken
Russia domestically, undermine its influence internationally, increase
its isolation, and carry out regime change around Russia's periphery and
even in the country itself. Russian leaders apparently have decided to
do to the West what they believe the West has done to them. Third,
Russia is engaging in a campaign to gain or regain influence in other
places where the Soviet Union once held sway. In the Balkans, for
example, Russia plays the nationalist and Christian Orthodox cards to
complicate Western efforts to integrate these countries into European
structures. In the Middle East, Russia seeks to protect its longstanding
equities in Syria and to convey its purported great power status to
domestic and international audiences, as well as its capacity to act
beyond its immediate neighborhood and gain a foothold in what is seen as
a traditionally U.S. sphere of influence. The final category consists of
Russian efforts to gain influence in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin
America. Some of these efforts involve forming coalitions of rising
powers willing to challenge the Western-dominated international system;
elsewhere, [[Moscow tries to]{.underline}]{.mark} cultivate
authoritarian leaders and **[[take advantage of frictions between the
United States and]{.underline}]{.mark}** some of **[[its traditional
allies or partners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Latin America, in
particular, Moscow hopes to embarrass Washington and show that it too
can make a foray into its main global adversary's backyard.

### Link\-\--Africa

#### Russian influence in Africa is [low now]{.underline} \-\-- but increased arms sales expands it

**Ramani 18** -- doctoral candidate in international relations at St.
Antony's College at Oxford. He is also a contributor to The Washington
Post, The Diplomat and the National Interest (Samuel, "As the U.S.
Disengages, Russia Ramps Up Aid and Arms Sales to Sub-Saharan Africa,"
World Politics Review,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/insights/24457/as-the-u-s-disengages-russia-ramps-up-aid-and-arms-sales-to-sub-saharan-africa)

[Beyond mining]{.underline} and other resources, [Russia is]{.underline}
still eyeing [energy sectors in sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline}, as it
promotes nuclear power as a driver of economic development. Its most
prominent move came in 2014, with a landmark but controversial \$76
billion deal for Russian energy giant Rosatom to build two nuclear power
plants in South Africa, which has the continent's only nuclear power
station. Then-President Jacob Zuma personally championed the deal,
bypassing South Africa's parliament. When the deal collapsed in 2017
after a South African court ruled it unlawful, Russia was forced to look
elsewhere in Africa for nuclear energy clients. That search has achieved
some notable success. Last October, Rosatom signed a \$20 billion deal
to construct two nuclear power plants in Nigeria, Africa's largest
economy. Russia is now set to play a leading role in eliminating
Nigeria's chronic electricity shortages, winning it praise. The Nigeria
deal also encouraged Lavrov to negotiate with Angola on the construction
of nuclear power plants, and to forge a nuclear technology-sharing
agreement with Namibia, the world's fourth largest producer of uranium.
[[The growing appeal of Russian weaponry has pushed several African
leaders to ask Moscow for help in carrying out counterterrorism
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}. When it comes to security, Russia has
focused chiefly on expanding its array of existing arms contracts and
positioning itself as a useful counterterrorism partner. [[Russia has
emphasized its willingness to sell arms to governments **without
discrimination**]{.underline}]{.mark} [on ideological or human rights
grounds, [portraying itself as a reliable arms vendor to]{.mark}
authoritarian [African leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many of those
leaders see proof of Russia's commitment to noninterference in Moscow's
strident defense of former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe against
potential U.N. sanctions in 2008, along with Russian arms sales to Sudan
after its president, Omar al-Bashir, was indicted by the International
Criminal Court in 2009. [[This hands-off policy has helped Russia expand
beyond its traditional Soviet-era coterie in sub-Saharan
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since 2010, Russia has supplied Uganda with
74 percent of its conventional weaponry, signed a \$1 billion defense
cooperation agreement with Angola, and agreed to a major
military-technical cooperation pact with Nigeria. These deals are likely
to continue to expand in the years to come, as Russia's effective use of
air power during its military intervention in Syria and successful
marketing of its S-400 missile defense system---which it recently sold
to Turkey, a NATO member---increase its influence over international
arms markets. The growing appeal of Russian weaponry to several African
countries has also pushed their leaders to solicit Moscow for help in
carrying out counterterrorism operations. Russia has been especially
interested in assisting Nigeria combat the extremist group Boko Haram,
while outlining a strategy to deepen its overall cooperation with Abuja.
Even though the Nigerian military continues to work closely with the
United States against Boko Haram, Russia's offers have been received
positively in Nigeria. Nigerian Defense Minister Mansur Dan Ali pointed
to Russia's potential role as a counterterrorism partner during his
meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Shoygu, last summer in
Moscow. Dan Ali even cited Moscow's record against the self-proclaimed
Islamic State in Syria---where Russia rarely distinguished between
"terrorists" and opposition forces---as a model for West Africa to
follow. As senior officials in other African countries, like Chad and
Somalia, echo the Nigerian defense minister's praise for Russia, [Moscow
could gain a more prominent role in providing logistical assistance to
governments across the continent facing their own domestic
insurgencies]{.underline}. It isn't surprising that, during his Africa
trip, Lavrov capitalized on Russia's growing reputation by offering
military assistance to Mozambique, which has experienced a wave of
attacks by Islamist groups in the gas-rich northern part of the country.
[[Even though Russia's influence in sub-Saharan Africa still **pales**
in comparison to]{.underline}]{.mark} China's---and, for that matter,
[[the]{.underline} [United States']{.underline}]{.mark}---[[Moscow has
paid]{.mark} more [attention to]{.mark}]{.underline} the region in
recent years, for its own economic interests and great power
aspirations, and to satisfy [[African countries' desire for
sophisticated weaponry. As Russia continues to expand its
network]{.underline}]{.mark} of partnerships and support
counterterrorism initiatives across the continent, [its rising influence
in sub-Saharan Africa could take a U.S. administration that has shown
little interest in Africa by surprise]{.underline}.

While Russian arms are competitive across sub-Saharan Africa, most of
the region's countries are comparatively poor. Defence spending in
absolute terms is therefore too modest for Africa to become a
destination of real commercial significance. This will not change unless
economic growth accelerates at a sustained rate across the region.
Nevertheless, [Russian exporters appear keen to strengthen their
position, with officials from Rosoboroneksport describing Africa as a
'growth market']{.underline}.70 [[Russian suppliers appear to be
prepared to tailor their approach to the African market by focusing on
the provision of either older equipment or of service and repair
facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}.71 Regardless of whether the region
grows in commercial importance, [[Russia's importance as a supplier of
armaments there means that it could **exploit any political
capital**]{.underline}]{.mark} that might be [gained from this position
by seeking to acquire [**basing rights** for its armed forces, or by
supporting its **energy and mining firms** in gaining rights to exploit

the only country to be making such efforts on the continent. It faces
stiff competition from China, which has been a growing source of arms
and has provided increasing support to African countries in the
development of their natural resources.

#### Russia won't sign on, but will fill-in supply vacuums

**Sorensen 15** -- Juris Doctor, December 2014, J. Reuben Clark Law

JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ABSTENTION AND THE TREATY\'S EFFECTIVENESS IN

[The ATT has been described as]{.underline} \"the most
[important]{.underline} \[treaty\] in the history of the United Nations
in the field of conventional arms control standards.\" 8 [But is the ATT
really the solution?]{.underline} UN Secretary General Ban Ki-[moon
opened the 2012 General Assembly stating, \"\[t\]he arms trade fuels
ill-regulated and civil conflicts,]{.underline} destabilizes regions and
expands the capabilities of terrorists and criminal networks. We do not
have a multilateral treaty on global trade in conventional arms. It\'s a
shame.\" 9 [The ATT was designed to \"prevent and eradicate\" this
problem]{.underline}; 10 [but, will it meet this goal?]{.underline}
Whenever States with principled positions attempt to reach an agreement,
some question arises as to the viability of such an agreement. 11 Not
every UN Member State 12 has faith in the ATT\'s ability \[\*239\] to
effectively address the problem. [[Russia, one of the world\'s largest
dealers in arms]{.underline}, 13 [believes the ATT is no more than a
superficial Band-Aid on a deep woun]{.underline}]{.mark}[d]{.underline}.
14 And if Russia does not get on board with the ATT, then how effective
can it really be? [Russia\'s justifications for abstention from signing
on to the ATT have some merit]{.underline}, as the ATT does not address
arms transfers to private parties. [However[, Russia\'s justifications
are also likely, in part, a **ploy to allow Russia to transfer arms to
States that might otherwise be prohibited** under the
ATT]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A nation balancing conflicting interests can
be tricky; such is the situation with Russia]{.underline}, therefore
justifying its abstention from the ATT is complex.

#### Russia will remain outside the treaty system \-\-- ensures fill-in

First, many States, including [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, either
[[rejected the ATT]{.underline}]{.mark} or abstained from joining it.
133 Additionally, the majority of the States who are signatories to the
ATT have not yet ratified it and may avoid ratifying the treaty
altogether. 134 Just as various countries thought it unwise to join the
treaty when the largest producer and seller of weapons was rejecting the
treaty, 135 [[it may be unwise to think the treaty will be effective
when the second largest producer and seller is not party to the
treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The more countries that do not feel
compelled to abide by the ATT]{.underline}\--either because they are not
party to the treaty or because they do not feel obligated\--[will equate
to **more arms transfers occurring outside the confines of the
ATT**]{.underline}. Nic Marsh of the Peace Research Institute Oslo 136
stated, \"Having the abstentions from two major arms exporters lessens
the moral weight of the treaty . . . . [[By abstaining
they]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[left their options
open]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" 137

#### Russian [alone]{.underline} undercuts ATT solvency

**Sorensen 15** -- Juris Doctor, December 2014, J. Reuben Clark Law

JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ABSTENTION AND THE TREATY\'S EFFECTIVENESS IN
APPLICATION, *11 BYU Int\'l L. & Mgmt. Rev. 237*, Lexis)

Additionally, the ATT will not be as effective as it could be. [[Without
Russia joining the treaty, the ATT loses]{.underline}]{.mark} some of
[i[ts]{.mark} potential [effectiveness.]{.mark} [Russia is one of the
largest suppliers of arms in the world, meaning that Russia **alone**
could supply arms to many of the States that the ATT is intended to
prevent from getting arms]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, other
States, including China, have followed suit and avoided becoming party
to the ATT. With [so]{.underline} many [key exporting]{.underline} and
importing [States abstaining]{.underline} or objecting, [the ATT will
not be able to regulate much of the world where the need for such
regulation exists]{.underline}. Further, as long as the ATT does not
regulate transfers to non-state actors, much of the problem the treaty
was intended to address will be left unaffected by the ATT. Lastly,
[even the Member States who are party to the ATT will likely subordinate
the ATT\'s goals to their own State\'s interests]{.underline}.

[The decrepitude of arms control treaties]{.underline} in Europe [is
becoming increasingly apparent at the same time as Russia continues to
act as a revisionist power. [Russia's unpredictability and lack of
transparency is part of its competitive advantage.]{.mark} [It will
**therefore not give this up** by returning to arms-control
agreements]{.mark} of the late cold war [or negotiating new
ones]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Arms control is an integrated part of
Russia's military strategy: to advance its own military position while
weakening that of its enemies]{.underline}. As a result, it is open to
arms-control agreements that would entrench its military superiority in
eastern Europe and prevent the technological gap between Russia and the
West from growing. This logic creates an opportunity for the West. If
Europe engages in rearmament, enhances its militaries' combat-readiness
and capacity to quickly conduct large-scale, sustainable deployments to
eastern Europe, it will deprive Russia of its relative military
superiority. Moscow will then be willing to talk on arms control.
Europeans still need to agree a common approach on what they want to
achieve vis-à-vis Russia, however. Otherwise, they will be divided and
public support for rearmament will falter.

[[Russian arms control behavior, including the desire to limit U.S.
military capabilities]{.mark} through legally binding agreements while
violating those agreements]{.underline} when convenient, [[is an element
of Russia's overall strategy for accomplishing Moscow's expansionist
goals]{.underline}]{.mark} outlined in Chapter One. [[Russia sees arms
control, including noncompliance with its treaty obligations, as a tool
to be employed as necessary to obtain military advantage]{.mark}, convey
strength, compel respect as a superpower, [deter Western challenges,

bolster the regime's respect and domestic legitimacy [by demonstrating
toughness and a willingness to confront the

cooperative activity]{.underline} to create a more benign world. It is
another arena in which to reinforce President Putin's statement that,
"It's best not to mess with us."1 [[Too often there is a tendency in the
West to dismiss individual Russian arms control violations as mere
"technical" violations that are not "militarily significant]{.mark}."
This approach ignores the broader role that arms control and a policy of
arms control noncompliance play in helping Russia to achieve its
**strategic objectives** and the military capabilities possible as a
result of noncompliance]{.underline}. Soviet/[[Russian arms control
violations generally are not accidents, one-time incidents,
misunderstandings or]{.mark} legitimate [disputes concerning the
technical meaning of treaty obligations]{.mark}]{.underline}. More
often, [they are directly related to Russian military objectives, which
in turn are related to achieving foreign policy goals such as: 1)
recovering Russia's great power status]{.underline} through enhanced
nuclear capability; [2) extending its sphere of influence
over]{.underline} (i.e., [dominating]{.underline}) [former Soviet space
by enhancing Russia's political and military power in Europe; 3)
constraining U.S. military capabilities; and, 4) undermining NATO's will
and capability to resist. [If an arms control
commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}---either legal or political---[[comes to
interfere with an important Russian objective, it is simply
ignored]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Significantly, Russia has violated arms
control agreements even when it was clear the violations would be
detected]{.underline}.

#### Russia uses arms control to expand military power at the expense of the US

**Payne** and Foster **17** -- \*Keith, PhD in IR @ USC, Professor of
Defense and Strategic Studies @ Mo State, \*\*John, PhD, Director of
Defense Research and Engineering, Department of Defense; Director of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ("Russian strategy Expansion,
crisis and conflict," *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)

[Russian arms control violations are a normal and now predictable part
of Russian practice. This arms control behavior is not ad
hoc]{.underline}, accidental, [or exist in a vacuum. It is linked to
Russian military doctrine]{.underline} and force posture goals, [which
in turn are linked to Russian foreign policy goals]{.underline}.
[Russian noncompliance is directed,]{.underline} at least in part,
[toward achieving military advantages that could help to intimidate NATO
states in peacetime and potentially defeat them in wartime]{.underline}.
Specifically, the capabilities acquired by [Russia]{.underline} as part
of its [noncompliance]{.underline} activities help
[facilitate]{.underline} and enable multiple goals, including: 1)
[recovering Russia's great power status]{.underline} (enabled by the
fear of its nuclear capabilities); 2) [extending Moscow's sphere of
influence and domination over former satellite]{.underline}
[states]{.underline} (resulting from the enhancement of Russia's
military power); 3) [constraining U.S. military
capabilities]{.underline} (exacerbated by creating monopolies in areas
where arms control has reduced or eliminated Western deterrent
capabilities); [and]{.underline} 4) [constraining NATO's will and
ability]{.underline} to counter or defend against Russian expansion by
the threat of nuclear escalation. Apparent covert [Russian nuclear
testing is a prime example of this]{.underline}. Russian nuclear weapons
are a key element of Moscow's defense policy and are seen as the basis
of Russia's great power status. Russian nuclear doctrine holds that
controlled and discriminate first use of nuclear weapons will
"de-escalate" a conventional war. Covert Russian nuclear testing may
help Russia realize such nuclear capabilities. Also largely overlooked
in today's debate is the significance of Russian noncompliance with
chemical and biological weapons treaties. Critically, Russian
noncompliance may have given Moscow a monopoly on biological and
chemical weapons in Europe that it could use or threaten to use in the
event of a major war. [Noncompliance with arms control agreements is
certainly not the sole reason for the quantitative and qualitative
growth of Soviet/Russian strategic forces. It has, however, contributed
substantially to that growth]{.underline}. [The military and political
significance of Russian arms control violations has **largely been**
**ignored** in the West]{.underline}. The military advantages are quite
considerable, especially when viewed in the context of continuing
reductions in Western nuclear and military capabilities. [Moscow's
extensive treaty violations]{.underline} may [increase both the prospect
of conflict and its consequences]{.underline}. Further, its violations
have provided Russia with key military capabilities that are highly
relevant to the current European security crisis, particularly in
Russian eyes. "Global norms" against nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons use may not impact Russian behavior in crises or conflict any
more than "global norms" against violating treaty obligations or
invading other countries and annexing their territory have prevented
Russia from doing so. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan rightly stated:
"[Simply collecting agreements will not bring peace. Agreements
genuinely reinforce peace only when they are kept. Otherwise, we are
building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of
war]{.underline}."107

Practices Act, for example. Thus, [countries turn to Moscow when they
wish to signal to Washington that they have other options if they do not
like the United States' pre-conditions]{.underline}. At the same time,
some Arab states are genuinely interested in diversifying supplies away
from the US. Indeed, after the 1991 Gulf War, several GCC states bought
Russian systems. The West should not discount Arab countries making such
decisions. Russia, unlike the America, invests effort across the MENA
region to sell weapons systems[. Western analysts tend to point out
Russia could never replace the United States]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
such views discount another option: [Moscow does not have to replace the
US. Other authoritarian leaders can choose to move closer to Russia
because the Kremlim offers Arab states different advantages including
quicker delivery and better negotiating terms]{.underline}. When it
comes to arms sales in the MENA region, Moscow has made major inroads
during the Putin era with Iran, Syria, Egypt, Libya and Algeria, and to
a lesser extent with Turkey, Iraq, and elsewhere in the Arab Persian
Gulf. It is also making small inroads with Tunisia and Morocco.

**Rounds 19** -- Ph.D. candidate at Georgetown University in
International Relations (Ray, "THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR
SAUDI ARABIA," *War on The Rocks*,
[https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/)](https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/)//BB)

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. [The
United States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second
place Russia remains]{.underline} a [distant]{.underline} 23 percent),
and has more than 40 defense companies in the top 100 globally. However,
with civilian deaths caused by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at
between 16,000 and 50,000 by the end of 2018, calls for the United
States to suspend arms sales to its largest client --- Saudi Arabia ---
have understandably gained traction in both Congress and the public.
More generally, [several authors have penned articles]{.underline} in
these virtual pages [calling for more selective U.S. arms export
decisions or outright embargos]{.underline}, governed less by economic
motivations and more by concern about blowback, human rights,
dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. [I]{.underline}
respectfully [disagree]{.underline} with all of these recommendations.
Whether it is delayed approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase,
an outright embargo, like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, or denial of
technology transfer, as in the 2016 Turkish Patriot missile request,
[using [the withholding of arms sales]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a blunt
[force]{.mark} instrument]{.underline} of coercion [is unlikely to
produce desired strategic benefits and [often
backfires]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Arms]{.mark} [exports are
**best**]{.mark} used [for]{.mark}]{.underline} maintaining or
strengthening relationships while [[limiting adversary access]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} client [states]{.mark}]{.underline}; a tool of nuanced
influence, not outright coercion. In fact, [[threatening to withhold
arms sales to coerce a state]{.mark} in[to]{.mark} [chang]{.mark}ing
[its]{.mark} [behavior]{.mark} often [has]{.mark} [the opposite
effect]{.mark}, [leading clients to **diversify their arms
sourcing**]{.mark} instead of shifting course]{.underline}. Similarly,
calls to restrict technology transfer and worries about demands for
direct offsets mistake what is known as "design technology transfer" for
the much more difficult "capacity" level of transfer. Both are explained
in more detail below, but for now it is worth noting that design
transfer, the level at which most of these offsets occur, does not lead
to the creation of an independent defense industry, but instead provides
the United States with a source of political power. The United States
should not fear technology transfer, but with the appropriate end-user
controls, encourage it. Additionally, while a large domestic market
provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for
political influence, sometimes economics do matter; especially when it
comes to preserving complex production lines for future flexibility.
Finally, the United States should not look to use an arms embargo to
coerce Saudi policy change, not for economic reasons, but simply because
it is unlikely to work. Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting Arms [[Arms
sales are useful]{.underline}]{.mark} tools [[for]{.underline}]{.mark}
maintaining communication, strengthening relationships, and [[keeping
potential adversary states at bay]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conversely, as a
blunt instrument of coercion (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend
Y), they are likely losers. [Senior [U.S. government officials]{.mark}
involved in the arms transfer process that I interviewed over the past
year during the course of my research have [echoed similar
sentiments]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is also borne out by previous
research]{.underline} providing evidence that using arms transfers as
situationally coercive tools is rarely successful. Interestingly,
[coercion attempts using arms transfers are least likely to be
successful when used as a punishment or threat against an autocratic
regime]{.underline}, such as Saudi Arabia. Instead,
[[punishments]{.underline}]{.mark} in the form of an embargo can often
[[push]{.mark} [a client to **diversify sourcing**]{.mark} rather than
to change behavior]{.underline}. [Consider Indonesia and
Egypt]{.underline}. [[In 2015, Egypt agreed to
purchase]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly 50 [[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}
MiG-29M/[[M2s]{.underline}]{.mark} and more than two-dozen French
Rafales. This represented a shocking turn of events after more than
three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter jets[. It was
also driven largely by the U.S. embargo]{.underline} put in place in
2013, after the Egyptian army's removal of then-President Mohamed Morsi,
who had won the presidency in a 2012 election. The embargo caused
significant tension between the two states driven by "an Egyptian sense
that they were at a point of mortal peril" while the United States was
moralizing about democratic reforms. Remarkably, [the United States
lifted the embargo in 2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian
policies]{.underline}, no official U.S. "democracy certification", and
Egyptian military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The U.S. arms
embargo as a tool of coercive change was an abject failure. [A similar
story played out in Indonesia more than a decade prior. A long-time arms
client of the United States with no history of Russian imports,
Indonesia announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase Russian
Su-27/30s]{.underline}. While Indonesia was always far more politically
neutral than Egypt, this remarkable turnaround in arms sourcing
diversification appears to be the result of a U.S. arms embargo
implemented in 1999 in response to Indonesia's apparent human rights
violations carrying out heavy-handed military actions in East Timor.
Furious at U.S. meddling in something the government considered a
domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to Russia with the specific
intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\] arms sales restrictions." In
other words, Indonesia looked to diversify, not capitulate. [Indonesia
continued sourcing Russian arms even after the United States lifted the
embargo]{.underline} in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably, even after the
United States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012, the archipelago
state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian Su-35s. The U.S. attempt at
coercion not only failed but continues to perpetuate negative strategic
effects today. Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer? Another argument for
a more restrictive arms export policy concerns direct industrial offsets
(those economic agreements in which a supplier invests in the industry
of a client state directly related to the arms being transferred) and
technology transfer. However, these tools should not be feared.
Technology transfer is unlikely to breed meaningful competition for the
United States where it matters most, in the medium- to high-end markets,
and instead gives the United States a source of political influence. The
problem in many analyses is confusion over the type of technology
transfer. There are three ideal-typical categories of transfer: material
transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and machines; design
transfer, like blueprints and schematics; and capacity transfer, which
involves basic scientific knowledge and expertise within the industrial
base. Most technology transfers ultimately fall into the first two
categories, despite what a client state might hope for. Consider the
2003 Polish decision to purchase F-16s from Lockheed Martin with direct
offsets valued at more than \$6 billion. This represented 170 percent of
the program value and the then-largest in commercial history. Despite
this massive investment, Poland does not design and produce their own
fighter jets today, but rather subsections of American-designed systems
under license. In fact, direct offsets provided inroads for U.S.
industry in the Polish defense industry in a manner that strongly
incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S. aircraft, and indeed
Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the near future. Offsets
and technology transfer may have helped revive portions of the Polish
defense industry and provided some domestic job creation, but it did not
create an independent competitor to the U.S. defense industry. This is
exactly as expected with material and design levels of transfer. While
some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or China,
might eventually create a world-leading defense industry, it will remain
out of the grasp of most states. Consider China, an unquestionable
economic powerhouse of recent decades. [[Despite decades of arms
purchases]{.mark}, technology transfer, blatant reverse engineering
attempts, and hundreds of billions of dollars, [China still turns to
Russia for help with]{.mark}]{.underline} the most [advanced
[weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline} such as fighter jets, helicopters,
surface-to-air missiles, radars, and jet engines. If China, the second
largest economy in the world struggles so mightily, what threat do
smaller, less capable states pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of
basic scientific knowledge and expertise crafted over decades, cannot
simply be uploaded, emailed to another state, or hacked. Rather, it
takes decades of intentional and costly investment. For high-end
weaponry, where research and development costs remain a prohibitive
barrier to entry, the United States and a handful of other advanced
economies are likely to remain in the driver's seat; even with generous
technology transfer agreements. Finally, [[consider]{.underline}]{.mark}
some of the negative second- and third-order [[effects]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} excessive restriction caused in [American unwillingness to
commit to selling the U.S]{.mark}.-made [Patriot missile]{.mark}
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} and its underlying technology [[to]{.mark}
[Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was recently posited as a U.S. export
restriction success. However, this restraint looks less successful each
passing day. Even with significant design transfer, it is unlikely
Turkey could obtain the requisite capacity transfer to be
self-sufficient in surface-to-air and anti-missile defense systems
anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S. technology, the United States
could have legally restricted Turkey's future export of it. More
importantly, [[Turkey]{.mark} [has]{.mark} since [agreed to
purchase]{.mark} [Russia's]{.mark} advanced]{.underline} S-400
surface-to-air missile [[system]{.underline},]{.mark} a blow to U.S. and
NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will put advanced Russian
technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally and tier-two F-35
industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on several F-35
components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about Turkey's
S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part of the
problem." [[Even worse,]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} since [approved]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[sale]{.mark} [of the Patriot to Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the
acting U.S. Defense Secretary recently commenting, "we need Turkey to
buy the Patriot." Was holding back on some surface-to-air missile
technology worth the strategic cost? It appears unlikely.

[ONLY a few months ago, Canadians were earnestly debating whether or not
the country's]{.underline} Liberal [administration was right to go ahead
with executing a \$12bn contract to deliver armoured vehicles to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. The government said it would, but acknowledged its
critics' concerns by agreeing to adopt a version of an international
treaty that limits arms sales to rogues (see article). However, things
took a different turn. [It was the Saudis who plunged the deal into
uncertainty]{.underline}. After Canada's foreign minister urged the
release of some political prisoners on Twitter, the Saudi government
declared that all new business with Canada was suspended. This left
Canadians unsure if the kingdom still wants the arms deal. And if the
Saudis do walk away, plenty of other countries will be happy to supply
armoured cars. "They could get their combat vehicles from Turkey, South
Korea or Brazil," says Pieter Wezeman, a researcher at SIPRI, a
Stockholm-based think-tank. In the United States, meanwhile, [Congress
has been pressing the administration to implement the letter of a law
that would force countries to make a hard, instant choice between buying
American or Russian weapons. But]{.underline} the Pentagon is hinting
that [America's huge diplomatic power does not]{.underline} quite
[stretch that far]{.underline}. Defence officials argue it would be
better to accept that some countries will go on buying Russian weapons
for a while, in the hope they will gradually kick the habit. [Both these
developments reflect]{.underline} the volatile (and from a Western
viewpoint, **[barely controllable]{.underline}**) [state of the global
arms market. Total demand is growing, the number of sellers is rising
and]{.underline} the [Western countries that have dominated the business
are less confident of shaping the playing field]{.underline}. Above all,
[buyers are becoming more insistent on their right to shop
around]{.underline}. For the likes of India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the
United Arab Emirates, "**[this is a buyer's market,]{.underline}**" says
Lucie Béraud-Sudreau of the International Institute for Strategic
Studies, a London-based think-tank. Speak softly and sell a big stick
The numbers show that the [global commerce in conventional weapons is
still dominated by the United States]{.underline}. [But America feels
strangely nervous about maintaining that role, and this year it has
adopted a more aggressive sales posture.]{.underline} Under a policy
proclaimed in April and mapped out in more detail last month, American
diplomats have been told to promote weapons sales more actively and
speed up procedures for approving them. [At first sight, American
apprehensions seem puzzling]{.underline}. There are several ways to
measure the arms market, but America comes out on top of all of them.
SIPRI has studied the volume of cross-border weapon transfers over the
five years to December and compared them with the previous five years
(see chart). The size of the world market rose by 10% between the two
periods. In the more recent one, America's slice of this expanding pie
was 34%, up from 30% in the previous five years. America and its five
nearest rivals (in descending order Russia, France, Germany, China and
Britain), account for nearly 80% of total transfers. Britain, meanwhile,
claims that last year it jumped to third place among global arms
exporters, as measured by the value of their sales. According to the
Defence and Security Organisation, a government body, America bagged 53%
of the global business, its "highest-ever market share". This left 16%
for Russia and 12% for Britain, double the share taken by France. In
part, [the jumpiness in Washington, DC, stems from the entry to the
market of new competitors]{.underline}, especially China. In part it
reflects new products and technologies where America will struggle to
keep its lead. Both these challenges were highlighted by the appearance
at last year's Paris Air Show of a Chinese military drone that looked
very like the American unmanned aircraft that have been used for
assassinations, for example in Pakistan. Hitherto, America has been
willing to share these powerful drones only with close European allies.
A new policy will broaden the range of customers and thus lessen the
risk that China will dominate a market that could soon be worth \$50bn a
year. China has long been better known as a buyer of arms, mainly from
Russia, than as a seller. A big share of its arms deliveries have gone
to close allies such as Pakistan. But it has enormously increased its
capacity to make and sell its own weapons, including ships and
submarines. Meanwhile, [American arms-export policy has been a
**delicate balance** between, on the one hand, seizing]{.underline}
economic and geopolitical [opportunity and, on the other, being
careful]{.underline} not to share technologies which could destabilise
war zones or be used against the United States. **[But]{.underline}**
such **[caution can be counter-productive]{.underline}**. At a panel
discussion in Washington this month, a defence-industry advocate
lamented that, because of America's technology-transfer curbs, France
had won from it a contract to sell airborne radar to India. "I like the
French, but I like American industry even more," he grumbled. In another
Franco-American contest over technology, France is finding it hard to
sell more Rafale combat aircraft to its prize arms customer, Egypt,
because the accompanying Scalp cruise missile incorporates American
know-how, the transfer of which to third parties is barred. France has
promised to develop its own technology, but Egypt may not have the
patience to wait. Egypt's government has also been a keen purchaser of
Russian equipment, including aircraft and attack helicopters. For
defence-equipment manufacturers such as Britain and France, export sales
matter ever more as a way to maintain their own industries. Britain's
edge in military aviation may depend on its sales to Saudi Arabia. And
the Royal Navy's ambitious building programme got a boost when Australia
said it would buy British for a new range of frigates. France wants to
develop a new air-to-air missile, but only, as Florence Parly, the
defence minister, put it, if it can get foreign customers. Such
[desperation adds to the frenzy of market competition]{.underline}. [So
does the utter indifference Russia and China display towards their
customers' human-rights policies]{.underline}. So too does the growth in
the number of countries that have graduated from being mainly buyers of
weapons and knowhow to sellers---Turkey, the Emirates and South Korea,
for example. Japan, which boasts a huge defence industry, is entirely
new to the market. It plunged in when the government lifted restrictions
on arms exports in 2014. It competes, albeit from a fairly weak
position, with China for Asia-Pacific customers. As for
[Russia]{.underline}, SIPRI calculates that its share of the global
market has slipped (to about 22% in 2013-17). But it [offers a blend of
tried-and-tested hardware and, to a few customers, superb know-how,
especially in air defence]{.underline}. [That creates a dilemma for
America]{.underline}, which hopes soon to sell weapons worth \$6bn to
India, but is dismayed by that country's determination to acquire S-400
air-defence systems from Russia: missiles that could ward off potential
threats from China or Pakistan. Other countries intent on continuing to
buy Russian include Indonesia and Vietnam. Jim Mattis, America's defence
secretary, has implored Congress not to be too harsh with Russia's
customers, so long as they pledge gradually to reduce their reliance. In
a letter leaked in July to Breaking Defense, a specialist news service,
he told a congressman: "[We are faced with a **once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to decrease Russia's dominance in key
regions**]{.underline}." [But that **could only happen if America were
free to sell its own weapons**]{.underline}. For customers, that means
that for the foreseeable future they can keep both American and Russian
weapons in their arsenals.

Though [its foreign actions are]{.underline} often [opportunistic,
Russia increasingly aims to create a multipolar world in which it plays
a more prominent role]{.underline}. Moscow's national security
establishment broadly supports this international outreach, which will
likely remain an enduring feature of Russian foreign policy. Washington
and its allies must carefully judge Russian actions case by case and
respond in concert when possible. THE KREMLIN'S INTERNATIONAL AGENDA
[Moscow has relied on relatively inexpensive]{.underline} diplomatic,
military, intelligence, cyber, trade, energy, and financial [tools to
wield influence and expand its global footprint]{.underline}. **[The
Kremlin has capitalized on Western missteps]{.underline}** and growing
anti-establishment sentiments in Europe and North America. [Russia will
likely continue trying to fill]{.underline} global [power vacuums
resulting from]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [Trump's]{.underline}
"America First" foreign [policy]{.underline}. IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S.
FOREIGN POLICY Formulating an effective response to Russia's global
activism will be challenging. To do so, U.S. policymakers should
consider four broad points: Ask the first-order question. How do
Russia's actions affect U.S. interests and foreign policy goals? In some
areas, Russian activities have damaged U.S. interests, but elsewhere
their impact has been symbolic rather than substantive. Russian activity
should not be conflated with Russian success. Weigh costs and benefits.
Russia's approach has had mixed results. Its investments in the Middle
East have paid off handsomely. But in Europe, Russian actions have
mobilized Western governments to counter them. Notably, Moscow has fewer
resources than the West, serious domestic problems, and no real allies.
Avoid overreacting. Not every instance of Russian activism threatens the
U.S.-led international order or U.S. security. At a minimum, Washington
and its allies should expose Moscow's tactics. More robust responses are
justified when important U.S. and allied interests are threatened---and
when Washington has realistic, sustainable means to thwart Moscow's
ambitions without exacerbating the situation. Leverage partnerships and
eschew a one-size-fits-all approach. There is no cookie-cutter solution
for countering Russian adventurism. Washington need not bear this burden
alone; it should develop tailored strategies with other actors to deter,
contain, and, if necessary, roll back Russian influence operations.
INTRODUCTION For much of the post--Cold War era, the United States and
Europe paid little attention to Russia's efforts to expand its
political, economic, and military influence abroad. The West saw these
efforts as relics of the Cold War, primarily confined to Russia's
immediate neighborhood but largely absent or at least ineffective
elsewhere. The effects of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's
internal challenges, and Moscow's stated desire for integration with the
West sharply constrained the Kremlin's interest and capacity to project
its influence on a global scale and diminished the West's interest in
Russian foreign policy and its global activities. However, since
Vladimir Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012 after a
four-year stint as prime minister, Russia has engaged in a broad,
sophisticated, well-resourced, and---to many observers---surprisingly
effective campaign to expand its global reach. To advance its diverse
objectives, Moscow has relied on a wide array of diplomatic, military,
intelligence, cyber, trade, energy, and financial tools to influence
political systems, public attitudes, and elite decisionmakers in Europe,
the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These objectives
include, first and foremost, undermining the U.S.-led liberal
international order and the cohesion of the West; enhancing Putin's
domestic legitimacy by demonstrating Russia's status as a global
superpower; promoting specific Russian commercial, military, and energy
interests; and tweaking the United States' nose in areas of traditional
U.S. influence. Russia has engaged in a broad, sophisticated,
well-resourced, and---to many observers---surprisingly effective
campaign to expand its global reach. The Kremlin launched this campaign
in response to the 2012 mass protests in Moscow, apparently convinced
that Western democracy promotion initiatives had instigated these
demonstrations to destabilize Russia itself and promote regime change.1
In 2014, following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the start
of its undeclared war in Ukraine, this counteroffensive intensified and
took on new qualities. Whereas previously the bulk of Russian efforts
had focused on defending Moscow's claimed "sphere of privileged
interests" around its periphery, the new campaign has sought to damage
the international image of Western democracy, exacerbate the internal
tensions within Western political and security institutions, and expand
Russia's global reach at the expense of Washington and its allies by
playing on Western missteps in different parts of the world. [For the
first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the United States is
facing a]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline} that is not, in former
president Barack Obama's memorable phrase, a mere "regional power," but
rather one [that is actively trying to project its influence and
establish a presence well beyond its periphery]{.underline}.2 Despite
Moscow's shift in strategy, the United States and its European partners
are increasingly focused on their own domestic challenges and regional
crises in Asia and the Middle East. [Russia is keen to exploit increased
opportunities in the]{.underline} resulting [vacuum]{.underline}, using
both hard and soft power, [to expand its influence and presence and to
take advantage of]{.underline} Donald Trump's presidency, marked by his
embrace of an "America First" foreign policy and:3 [a retreat
from]{.underline} long-established [U.S. leadership]{.underline} in
upholding the rules-based international order Washington helped create
after World War II; an abandonment of democracy promotion and rule of
law as elements of U.S. foreign policy; a return to isolationism and a
rejection of nation-building efforts to redirect U.S. resources needed
at home; a dismissal of multilateral cooperation and a devaluation of
long-standing U.S. alliances; the worst domestic political crisis in the
United States in many decades; and, most importantly, a refusal to
acknowledge the challenge posed by Russian adventurism. Finding examples
of Russian global activism is easy. Assessing its motivations,
consequences, and effectiveness is not. Specifically, it can be hard to
tell whether a given Russian behavior is meant to actively undermine the
liberal political and economic order that has flourished under U.S.
leadership or whether it is designed primarily to shore up Putin's
domestic standing and to create timely economic opportunities for
domestic Russian constituencies that support his regime. Likewise,
framing a coherent and effective U.S. response to Russia's increased
global activism will be challenging. The risk of doing too much or too
little is real, and getting the answer right entails asking a series of
challenging questions. Is Moscow's behavior largely symbolic or does it
threaten the interests of the United States or its closest allies? What
is the cost to U.S. interests of Russia's efforts to gain geopolitical
and economic toeholds beyond its immediate neighborhood? When should
Russian actions trigger a strong U.S. response? Which Russian activities
may risk overreach and pushback? What are the best ways to measure the
impact---both in Russia and the West---of Moscow's recent global
activism? Finding examples of Russian global activism is easy. Assessing
its motivations, consequences, and effectiveness is not. Identifying the
key drivers of Russia's global activism and providing an overview of
Moscow's many efforts to expand its global influence is a useful and
important way to begin formulating appropriate and effective responses
to these behaviors. In some areas, Russian activities have damaged
Western interests, but in others their impact has proven to be more
symbolic than substantive. Not every far-flung Russian initiative should
be viewed as part of a global zero-sum competition between the United
States and Russia, and the costs to Russia of some of these efforts
could exceed the benefits Moscow hopes to gain. Policymakers should seek
to assess the interests that a given Russian behavior is seeking to
advance, which policy tools Moscow is employing, which U.S. interests
are being undermined, and which U.S. policy tools would constitute the
most effective response. THE WEST AND THE REST Russia's global activism
can be divided into four geographic regions. While there may be some
uncertainty about the drivers at play in each of these regions, there is
little uncertainty about the considerable momentum behind these efforts.
In general, Moscow's ordering of priorities aligns closely with the
proximity of the region to Russia, as well as with Russian threat
perceptions. First are Moscow's efforts to retain its influence or
counter Western influence in the states of the former Soviet Union. In
its immediate periphery, Moscow aims to firm up its hold on its
neighbors to prevent additional countries from aligning too closely with
the West, and to preserve a buffer zone of pro-Russian or, at least,
neutral states around it. In countries that have already turned away
from Russia---Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine---Moscow seeks to undermine
their political transitions, court their publics, and prevent their true
integration with Western political, economic, or security structures.
Moscow also is keen to shore up its influence in Central Asia, a region
increasingly dominated economically by China. The second category
consists of Moscow's efforts to undermine the Western and transatlantic
institutions it considers its principal adversaries---the United States,
the European Union (EU), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). Moscow has attempted to exploit their internal divisions and
challenges as well as the uncertainty about Washington's commitment to
its allies and partners since President Donald Trump's embrace of the
"America First" agenda. Moscow's anti-Western actions are motivated by a
widely held view in the Russian security establishment that the
administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush
actively sought to weaken Russia domestically, undermine its influence
internationally, increase its isolation, and carry out regime change
around Russia's periphery and even in the country itself. Russian
leaders apparently have decided to do to the West what they believe the
West has done to them. Third, Russia is engaging in a campaign to gain
or regain influence in other places where the Soviet Union once held
sway. In the Balkans, for example, Russia plays the nationalist and
Christian Orthodox cards to complicate Western efforts to integrate
these countries into European structures. In the Middle East, Russia
seeks to protect its longstanding equities in Syria and to convey its
purported great power status to domestic and international audiences, as
well as its capacity to act beyond its immediate neighborhood and gain a
foothold in what is seen as a traditionally U.S. sphere of influence.
The final category consists of Russian efforts to gain influence in
parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Some of these efforts involve
forming coalitions of rising powers willing to challenge the
Western-dominated international system; elsewhere, [Moscow tries
to]{.underline} cultivate authoritarian leaders and [take advantage of
frictions between the United States and]{.underline} some of [its
traditional allies or partners. In Latin America, in particular, Moscow
hopes to embarrass Washington and show that it too can make a foray into
its main global adversary's backyard]{.underline}.

#### Russia [pounces]{.underline} on US weakness in Latin America

**Tidd 17** -- Admiral, COMMANDER, UNITED STATES SOUTHERN COMMAND (Kurt,
BEFORE THE 115TH CONGRESS SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE 6 APRIL 2017,
Lexis)

Mr. Chairman, I'll speak plainly: if we care about what's going on in
the South China Sea, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, it's worth
keeping an eye on Chinese, Russian, and Iranian activity in this part of
the world, too. [For Russia]{.underline}, China, and Iran, [Latin
America is not an afterthought]{.underline}. These global actors view
the Latin American economic, political, and security arena as an
opportunity to achieve their respective long-term objectives and advance
interests that may be incompatible with ours and those of our partners.
[Their vision for an alternative international order poses a challenge
to every nation that values non-aggression, rule of law, and respect for
human rights]{.underline}---the very same principles that underlie the
Inter-American system of peace and cooperation. Some of what they're
doing---while not a direct military threat---does warrant examination.
Even seemingly benign activities can be used to build malign influence.
Now the region's number two trading partner, China has courted Latin
America through economic diplomacy, importing more and more raw
materials, offering loans, and pledging billions in investments in
infrastructure development. It sees its own development as contingent on
the development of other countries, including those in Latin America and
the Caribbean.2 Beijing cooperates with Latin America on space,
potential nuclear power projects, and telecommunications networks, which
could pose security concerns to the United States. China's military soft
power lies in its ability to engage through offers of all-expenses-paid
training, nostrings-attached defense sales and financing to regional
militaries, and donations of equipment and humanitarian aid. China
prioritizes engagement with regional organizations like the Community of
Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) that exclude the United
States, and seeks to leverage regional relationships to reshape
international economic and financial institutions to its advantage.3 [As
part of the Kremlin's aim to regain its status as a global
power]{.underline} and prove its prowess to domestic audiences, [Russia
uses soft power tools in an attempt to challenge U.S. leadership in the
Western Hemisphere and displace traditional U.S. goodwill
initiatives]{.underline}. Examples include the construction of an
international police training facility in Nicaragua that will be used to
provide regional counternarcotics training and the funding of a vaccine
production plant that will supposedly make drugs accessible and
affordable throughout Central America. Additionally, Russia seeks to
discredit the United States through state-owned media like RT-Español
and SputnikMundo, which spread misinformation to create doubts and
distrust about U.S. intentions and policy towards the region and other
parts of the world. [The Russians]{.underline} are also engaging in some
disquieting behavior, such as [providing battle tanks to Nicaragua,
which impacts regional stability and could cause its neighbors to divert
vital resources (needed to fight threat networks and address
developmental challenges) to maintain parity]{.underline}. As a
continuing state sponsor of terrorism, Iranian involvement in the
Western Hemisphere is always a matter of concern. With the easing of
economic sanctions, Iran may be seeking to rebuild its relationships in
the region. Tehran uses cooperative technological, economic, and
diplomatic interests as the centerpiece of its regional diplomacy.
Although on the surface it portrays its actions as innocuous, Iran could
exploit its cultural centers to build networks, which could be leveraged
to extend its influence and advance its interests. Broadly speaking,
some of this outreach is concerning, especially to those of us who care
about advancing human rights and promoting regional peace and stability.
Keep in mind there's no Chinese, Russian, or Iranian equivalent of a
Leahy Law, no comparable conditions on security assistance, no
independent domestic media that carefully scrutinizes their activities.
Their arms sales aren't tied to international protocols or human rights
vetting. Their loans don't come with requirements to follow strict
environmental or anti-corruption standards, or even clear terms and
conditions for repayment. Their unscrupulous business practices and
disregard for rule of law facilitates corruption, reduces trust in
governments, and poses challenges to the norms and values that have
brought prosperity and security for millions of people across our
hemisphere. It's also worth noting that in recent years these actors
have capitalized on the perception that [the U.S.]{.underline} is
disengaging from the region. Our partners plainly see that we are
conducting fewer engagements; holding smaller and less frequent
exercises; and that we have smaller U.S. military presence in regional
embassies and fewer forces and platforms than ever before. When budget
constraints limit our ability to engage with our regional partners, it
sends a message that others can, and do, exploit. And while we should
work harder to understand the true intentions of these actors, whatever
they intend, in most cases our best response is to strengthen our own
security relationships, rather than focus on "countering" or "competing"
with the likes of China or Russia. At times---when it supports our
interests and those of our partners---we should follow avenues for
cooperation. At others, we might find we need to work with our partners
to address negative influence or destabilizing actions. At all times,
[we should focus on **being the best possible partner** to the
region]{.underline}. So it's on us to demonstrate our commitment by
being an equal and principled partner; it's on us to earn, and keep, the
region's trust. It's on us, because we lose relationships not as a
result of any Chinese or Russian actions; we lose them, in large part,
by not demonstrating the depth of our commitment to the region. Our
leadership is weakened not because China or Russia offer compelling
alternatives, but because it's not always clear to our network of allies
and partners what's important to us. [American (and Inter-American)
principles are undermined not because they no longer matter, but because
we]{.underline} and our partners [don't do everything we can to protect
and promote them.]{.underline} Mr. Chairman, it comes down to this: we
have a choice. [Success or failure in this region depends
on]{.underline} us, what we stand for, and [what we do]{.underline},
much more than it depends on anyone else.

Russian President Vladimir [Putin has made no effort to hide his desire
to reestablish his country as a viable power player and competitor to
U.S. influence in the region]{.underline}. Viewed through the lens of
the Gerasimov Doctrine, [this engagement is both rational from the
Russian perspective and dangerous to the United States]{.underline}. So
far, Russia has primarily focused its outreach efforts on allies in the
Bolivarian Alliance, led by Venezuela and including Cuba, Nicaragua,
Bolivia, El Salvador, and Suriname, all of whom share a strong anti-U.S.
ideology with each possessing deeply criminalized governments.1 Often
operating as a sort of "parasite state," the public outreach of the
Putin regime in Latin America is designed to maximize impact at low
cost. To date, this **[approach consists largely of weapons sales and
donations]{.underline}**, high level state-to-state visits, military and
police training in areas of U.S. specialization such as
counternarcotics, and financial assistance in avoiding the U.S.-based
banking system. Within international forums, Russia has used its seat on
the UN Security Council to protect Venezuela and Nicaragua from
international sanctions, and has aggressively moved to open up financial
operations---including banks and a crypto currency---to help its allies
blunt the impact of U.S. and EU sanctions. [The Russian
presence]{.underline}, increasingly accompanied by Russian organized
crime groups operating under the protection of the Russian state, [is
viewed by most U.S. stakeholders as presenting the biggest strategic
challenge]{.underline} of the three countries discussed.

largest arms supplier to the MENA region.]{.underline} The country
accounted for 18% of the total volume of arms imports by MENA states,

arms. In recent years, [Russia]{.underline} has further expanded its
arms transfers to MENA [seeking to re¬establish its influence in the
region. To MENA countries]{.underline}, [acquiring arms from
Russia]{.underline} is advantageous. It [allows them to]{.underline}
diversify their sources of arms supply and thereby [become less
dependent on Western suppliers.]{.underline} Consequently, this has
enabled Russia to compete with other established arms suppliers such as

imperatives.30 [Many Middle Eastern states view Russia either as a
genuine alternative supplier or as a second option]{.underline} whose
presence might increase regional buyers' leverage with U.S. officials

#### Russia will seize US weakness in the Middle East \-\-- they'll fill the arms sales vacuum

Overall, [Putin's current policy]{.underline} in the Middle East is
succeeding. While some scholars brand him a mere tactician and not a
strategist, he is actually both.657 Not only has he seized initiative in
the Middle East, but he also [has a clear end state in mind---a
polycentric world where Russia has renewed geopolitical strength to
balance the United States]{.underline}. Furthermore, many of
[Russia's]{.underline} tactical [victories]{.underline} in improving
relations with Middle Eastern countries have [come at the expense of
Western influence, specifically America's]{.underline}. [While some of
these victories, like the Western embargo of Egypt, were not part of a
master plan on Putin's part, his actions display a **deft
"opportunistic" touch**]{.underline}.658 It was Putin who flew into
Syria in December 2017, declaring "Mission Accomplished" in regard to
the war versus the Islamic State.659 As Matthew Spence, the former
Deputy Secretary of Defense for Middle Eastern Policy remarked,
"**[power abhors a vacuum]{.underline}**."660 [Putin]{.underline} fully
understands the logic behind Spence's statement. He
[observed]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} Administration [beating a
slow retreat]{.underline} from playing the region's "policeman."661 He
then saw the Trump Administration's recent rash of incoherent policy,
such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, effectively
destroying America's ability to mediate Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.662 As such, [he has been able to exploit the void of
American leadership]{.underline} and insert Russia back into a position
of influence in order to, as Vladimir Frolov states, "cut the \[the
United States\] down to size."663 [Putin will continue to capitalize on
Western weaknesses]{.underline} during his ongoing campaign [to foster a
polycentric world and restore Russia's reputation to that of a great
power]{.underline}. [Given the local demand that exists]{.underline} in
the region, [arms sales will remain one of Putin's key tools to sustain
and increase Russian influence in the Middle East]{.underline}. As
mentioned earlier, [the long-term success of Putin's plan will require
additional diplomatic maneuvering]{.underline}, but his current efforts
are laying the foundation for positive future outcomes.

After almost two decades of relative political obscurity,
[Russia]{.underline} is back, and [has]{.underline} once more [set its
sights on a global role beyond the classic trade of goods and services

non-economic elements are almost always present when it comes to such a
specific commodity as weaponry. Opinion on this greatly vary.
Subscribers of new cold war rhetoric see Russia as a great threat trying
to dismantle the international security order established by the United
States. We often heard such remarks from Hillary Clinton and her
followers, as well as think-tanks and the media friendly to her. \"I
think [Russia\'s objectives are to stymie and to confront and to
undermine American power whenever and wherever they can,\" Clinton
told]{.underline} the [Brookings]{.underline} Institution in September
2015. [But how far Russia\'s resurgence in the Middle East will
ultimately go remains to be seen]{.underline}. [In any case, Russia\'s
arms sales will play an **important role** in the country\'s
geopolitical plans]{.underline}.

### Link\-\--Saudi Arabia

#### Decreased dependence on Western arms sales causes Saudi Arabia to turn to Russian arms.

During a meeting in Moscow in October 2017, [[Russia and Saudi Arabia
reached a\[n\]]{.mark} preliminary [agreement for the]{.mark} potential
acquisition of [Russian weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} The agreement
included S-400 air defence systems and possible transfer of technologies
for the local production of Russian weapons including Cornet-EM
anti-tank missile systems and TOS¬1A multiple rocket launcher systems.
Some Russian experts believe that Saudi Arabia may also be interested in
Russian aviation and aircraft production, in particular in the Su¬30SM,
Su-35S and Su-34 combat aircraft that were tested during operations in
Syria ("Araviyskiy proryv: Rossiya tesnit SSHA na rynke oruzhiya
Blizhnego Vostok", 2017). However, to date, no orders have been placed.
[In theory[, if Saudi Arabia]{.mark} aspires to [reduce its dependence
on Western suppliers, Russia]{.mark}n weapons [would represent a
viable]{.mark} and important a[lternative.]{.mark} Moreover, Saudi
Arabia has made significant efforts to expand its domestic defence
industry.]{.underline} Therefore, it is interested in building
indigenous capacities with regards to the production of military systems
and technologies, which Russia is ready and willing to share.

#### 4. Saudi Arabia would shift to Russia if arms were cut off---this causes the entire Gulf region to follow suit.

If Senators Paul and Murphy would have succeeded in their measure,
Riyadh would almost certainly have gone to another large military
supplier, possibly Russia. Saudi and other GCC officials fear that Iran,
which is not only ideologically and theologically diametrically opposed
to the Kingdom, but also has a population and territory several times
the size of Saudi Arabia, poses an existential threat. The uncomfortable
truth is that Yemen is a proxy war in the Saudi-Iranian competition.
Riyadh feels that it must win in Yemen against the Houthi rebels (who
the Saudis are convinced are sponsored by Iran), and the only way to win
is through military power. [[Saudi Arabia does not have a]{.mark}n
indigenous [military]{.mark} industry [to support the war]{.mark}; [it
has to find military suppliers to sustain its war effort]{.mark}.
[Had]{.mark} the sale been blocked and [Saudi Arabia shifted to]{.mark}
Russia, China, or [other suppliers for military purchases, other Gulf
States would have followed suit]{.mark}, putting in jeopardy an
additional tens of billions of dollars in sales by American
multinational companies and thousands of highly-skilled manufacturing
jobs.]{.underline} Going forward, when considering whether to block arms
sales to Saudi Arabia, therefore, Congress should not only worry about
the particular sale in question. It should also consider the wider
negative implications that a suspension would have on tens of thousands
of high-skilled manufacturing jobs all across America, tens of billions
of dollars in revenues for U.S. companies, and the wider defense
industry.

#### The plan causes Saudi to seek arms from Russia \-\-- completely obviates any benefit of the plan

**Rounds 19** -- Ph.D. candidate at Georgetown University in
International Relations (Ray, "THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR
SAUDI ARABIA," *War on The Rocks*,
[https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/)](https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/)//BB)

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. [The
United States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second
place Russia remains]{.underline} a [distant]{.underline} 23 percent),
and has more than 40 defense companies in the top 100 globally. However,
with civilian deaths caused by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at
between 16,000 and 50,000 by the end of 2018, calls for the United
States to suspend arms sales to its largest client --- Saudi Arabia ---
have understandably gained traction in both Congress and the public.
More generally, [several authors have penned articles]{.underline} in
these virtual pages [calling for more selective U.S. arms export
decisions or outright embargos]{.underline}, governed less by economic
motivations and more by concern about blowback, human rights,
dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. [I]{.underline}
respectfully [disagree]{.underline} with all of these recommendations.
Whether it is delayed approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase,
an outright embargo, like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, or denial of
technology transfer, as in the 2016 Turkish Patriot missile request,
[using the withholding of arms sales as a blunt force
instrument]{.underline} of coercion [is unlikely to produce desired
strategic benefits and often backfires]{.underline}.

[Arms exports are **best** used for]{.underline} maintaining or
strengthening relationships while [limiting adversary access to client
states]{.underline}; a tool of nuanced influence, not outright coercion.
In fact, [threatening to withhold arms sales to coerce a state into
changing its behavior often has the opposite effect, leading clients to
**diversify their arms sourcing** instead of shifting
course]{.underline}. Similarly, calls to restrict technology transfer
and worries about demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as
"design technology transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity"
level of transfer. Both are explained in more detail below, but for now
it is worth noting that design transfer, the level at which most of
these offsets occur, does not lead to the creation of an independent
defense industry, but instead provides the United States with a source
of political power. The United States should not fear technology
transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls, encourage it.
Additionally, while a large domestic market provides the United States
the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political influence,
sometimes economics do matter; especially when it comes to preserving
complex production lines for future flexibility. Finally, the United
States should not look to use an arms embargo to coerce Saudi policy
change, not for economic reasons, but simply because it is unlikely to
work.

Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting Arms

[Arms sales are useful]{.underline} tools [for]{.underline} maintaining
communication, strengthening relationships, and [keeping potential
adversary states at bay]{.underline}. Conversely, as a blunt instrument
of coercion (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend Y), they are
likely losers. [Senior U.S. government officials involved in the arms
transfer process that I interviewed over the past year during the course
of my research have echoed similar sentiments]{.underline}. [This is
also borne out by previous research]{.underline} providing evidence that
using arms transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successful. Interestingly, [coercion attempts using arms
transfers]{.underline} are least likely to be successful when used as a
punishment or threat against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi Arabia.
Instead, punishments in the form of an embargo can often [push a client
to **diversify sourcing** rather than to change behavior]{.underline}.

[Consider Indonesia and Egypt]{.underline}. [In 2015, Egypt agreed to
purchase]{.underline} nearly 50 [Russian]{.underline}
MiG-29M/[M2s]{.underline} and more than two-dozen French Rafales. This
represented a shocking turn of events after more than three decades of
purchasing only American-made fighter jets[. It was also driven largely
by the U.S. embargo]{.underline} put in place in 2013, after the
Egyptian army's removal of then-President Mohamed Morsi, who had won the
presidency in a 2012 election. The embargo caused significant tension
between the two states driven by "an Egyptian sense that they were at a
point of mortal peril" while the United States was moralizing about
democratic reforms. Remarkably, [the United States lifted the embargo in
2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian policies]{.underline}, no
official U.S. "democracy certification", and Egyptian military support
for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The U.S. arms embargo as a tool of
coercive change was an abject failure.

[A similar story played out in Indonesia more than a decade prior. A
long-time arms client of the United States with no history of Russian
imports, Indonesia announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase
Russian Su-27/30s]{.underline}. While Indonesia was always far more
politically neutral than Egypt, this remarkable turnaround in arms
sourcing diversification appears to be the result of a U.S. arms embargo
implemented in 1999 in response to Indonesia's apparent human rights
violations carrying out heavy-handed military actions in East Timor.
Furious at U.S. meddling in something the government considered a
domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to Russia with the specific
intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\] arms sales restrictions." In
other words, Indonesia looked to diversify, not capitulate. [Indonesia
continued sourcing Russian arms even after the United States lifted the
embargo]{.underline} in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably, even after the
United States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012, the archipelago
state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian Su-35s. The U.S. attempt at
coercion not only failed but continues to perpetuate negative strategic
effects today.

Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer?

Another argument for a more restrictive arms export policy concerns
direct industrial offsets (those economic agreements in which a supplier
invests in the industry of a client state directly related to the arms
being transferred) and technology transfer. However, these tools should
not be feared. Technology transfer is unlikely to breed meaningful
competition for the United States where it matters most, in the medium-
to high-end markets, and instead gives the United States a source of
political influence. The problem in many analyses is confusion over the
type of technology transfer. There are three ideal-typical categories of
transfer: material transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and
machines; design transfer, like blueprints and schematics; and capacity
transfer, which involves basic scientific knowledge and expertise within
the industrial base. Most technology transfers ultimately fall into the
first two categories, despite what a client state might hope for.
Consider the 2003 Polish decision to purchase F-16s from Lockheed Martin
with direct offsets valued at more than \$6 billion. This represented
170 percent of the program value and the then-largest in commercial
history. Despite this massive investment, Poland does not design and
produce their own fighter jets today, but rather subsections of
American-designed systems under license. In fact, direct offsets
provided inroads for U.S. industry in the Polish defense industry in a
manner that strongly incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S.
aircraft, and indeed Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the
near future. Offsets and technology transfer may have helped revive
portions of the Polish defense industry and provided some domestic job
creation, but it did not create an independent competitor to the U.S.
defense industry. This is exactly as expected with material and design
levels of transfer. While some of the very largest industrial states,
such as India or China, might eventually create a world-leading defense
industry, it will remain out of the grasp of most states. Consider
China, an unquestionable economic powerhouse of recent decades. [Despite
decades of arms purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse
engineering attempts, and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still
turns to Russia for help with]{.underline} the most [advanced
weaponry]{.underline} such as fighter jets, helicopters, surface-to-air
missiles, radars, and jet engines. If China, the second largest economy
in the world struggles so mightily, what threat do smaller, less capable
states pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of basic scientific
knowledge and expertise crafted over decades, cannot simply be uploaded,
emailed to another state, or hacked. Rather, it takes decades of
intentional and costly investment. For high-end weaponry, where research
and development costs remain a prohibitive barrier to entry, the United
States and a handful of other advanced economies are likely to remain in
the driver's seat; even with generous technology transfer agreements.
Finally, [consider]{.underline} some of the negative second- and
third-order [effects that excessive restriction caused in American
unwillingness to commit to selling the U.S.-made Patriot missile
system]{.underline} and its underlying technology [to
Turkey]{.underline}. This was recently posited as a U.S. export
restriction success. However, this restraint looks less successful each
passing day. Even with significant design transfer, it is unlikely
Turkey could obtain the requisite capacity transfer to be
self-sufficient in surface-to-air and anti-missile defense systems
anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S. technology, the United States
could have legally restricted Turkey's future export of it. More
importantly, [Turkey has since agreed to purchase Russia's
advanced]{.underline} S-400 surface-to-air missile [system]{.underline},
a blow to U.S. and NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will
put advanced Russian technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally
and tier-two F-35 industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on
several F-35 components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about
Turkey's S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part
of the problem." [Even worse, the United States has since approved the
sale of the Patriot to Turkey]{.underline}, with the acting U.S. Defense
Secretary recently commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was
holding back on some surface-to-air missile technology worth the
strategic cost? It appears unlikely.

Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense

As others have pointed out, the United States can afford to "make
economic \[...\] sacrifices" in order to privilege politico-security
benefits in arms export decisions. As one author recently explained in
War on the Rocks: The United States is so economically advantaged in
making and selling weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons
proliferation \[and\] ... technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust
defense industrial base) while retaining its commanding market position.
This is undoubtedly true. However, on rare occasions economics do
matter. Specifically, maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a
production line open which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need
to be prioritized. Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and
F-15. In December 2011, the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off the
assembly line, 554 short of the original program requirement. At the
same time, close U.S. allies such as Japan and Australia made inquiries
about purchasing further increments of the fifth-generation fighter,
which would have kept production going for at least several more years.
The United States rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line
instead. A 2011 RAND Corporation study estimates the cost of restarting
production and fabricating 75 additional F-22s to be \$17 billion ---
nearly \$227 million per jet. Despite this cost and because of an
evolving international security environment, the US Congress inserted
language into the 2017 defense budget directing the U.S. Air Force to
conduct a "production restart assessment," though the likelihood of a
production restart remains infinitesimally small. Fortunately, the
outcome is different for the F-15. In 2013, Qatar made a request for the
purchase of 70 F-15QAs, worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another
export order the 40-year old F-15 production line was slated to close by
2019, eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for
nearly three years, the U.S. administration finally approved the deal in
late 2016, guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the
F-22, the United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and
F-18 and F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to
be an especially prescient decision, as the FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100)
F-15EX air superiority platforms; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is only possible because other countries have spent roughly
\$5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15
into what it is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting
\[these upgrades\] for free."

What About Saudi Arabia?

In sum, more restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright
embargos are unlikely to succeed in policy coercion. [While arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
**diversification**, not desired policy changes]{.underline}.
Additionally, fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating a
competitor out of every client are generally unfounded in the high-end
market in which the United States generally deals. Finally, while the
large domestic market provides the United States the luxury of
sacrificing financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics
do matter, particularly when it comes to saving a production line for
future flexibility. [These conclusions should therefore inform U.S.
policy on Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. The intent here is not to argue the
moral or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi
Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the war in Yemen. It is
natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and want to take any actions
necessary to stop it. However, I ultimately argue against a Saudi
embargo. This is not because, as the president has argued, it might cost
a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense industry jobs. As
others have pointed out, the economic impact of Saudi arms purchases on
the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather, [embargoing Saudi
Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi policies, but likely to
further damage U.S. ties with Riyadh]{.underline}. In the near-term,
[Saudi Arabia can substitute other weapons]{.underline}, such as the
Eurofighter and Tornado, and "dumb bombs" instead of U.S.-built "smart
weapons." [The Saudis can]{.underline} also [rely more heavily
on]{.underline} their Emirati and Egyptian partners using [non-U.S.
produced arms]{.underline}. In the medium to long term, [such an embargo
is likely to push the Kingdom to greater arms diversification. If
history is any guide, the United States will eventually lift any
potential arms embargo with little change in Saudi behavior, but **only
after having provided an opportunity for adversary states** such as
Russia]{.underline} and China [to **gain a strategic foothold** in
Riyadh]{.underline}. [Some might counter that it would be extremely
difficult and costly, in both time and money, for the Saudis to
significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. This is absolutely the case]{.underline}. **[However, costly
does not mean impossible]{.underline}**. [Less wealthy states have
already done it. Egypt is one example above; but others such as
Venezuela and even tiny Kuwait --- frustrated at years of U.S. approval
delays --- have significantly diversified their arms
acquisitions]{.underline}. In other words, [with the money and options
available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers showing a stomach for
a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe that the Saudis might
**significantly diversify** their arms acquisitions]{.underline} over
time [in response to a U.S. embargo. Thus, while a U.S. embargo might
be]{.underline} morally compelling and [emotionally satisfying, it is
unlikely to create meaningful change for those most at risk or be
strategically beneficial to the United States]{.underline}. In the
absence of a compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on
Saudi Arabia might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers
should look elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

Whatever the reason, the green-light policy has proved to be a failure.
The United States has not ended up with a close partner in the Middle
East but with a rogue ally drawing America into unnecessary quagmires
and hurting its interests. The question is what to do about it.

has to be carefully estimated.

President Donald Trump released a statement on November 20 in which he
supported Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's (MBS) claim
that he had nothing to do with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, directly
contradicting a leaked CIA assessment that MBS ordered the killing.
[Vowing to stand with U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, Trump cited lucrative
foreign military sales and Iranian aggression among the reasons for his
support. Saudi Arabia's disastrous war in Yemen has been met with a
similar absence of criticism from the administration. However, the
United States should do more than wring its hands about this war that
has killed thousands and brought many more to the brink of starvation,
by applying pressure on Saudi Arabia to change its course]{.underline}.
The question is how? Walking away from supporting the Saudi-led war in
Yemen and ending U.S. mid-air refueling might give Washington the moral
high ground, but it will do little to stop the killing. [The Saudis view
the threat in Yemen as crucial to their interests, so U.S. pressure to
end the war altogether will fall short of causing real change. To the
Saudis, the threat of Iran establishing a foothold on their southern
border is much more vital to their interests than procuring U.S.
weapons. Rather than walk away from Yemen, they will buy Russian bombs
or use less sophisticated weapons and tactics that will kill even more
civilians. Americans will have washed our hands of a morally
unacceptable situation, but civilian deaths and the threat of famine
will actually get worse, and the world will look on and do nothing. The
only approach worse than walking away is what the United States is
currently doing---giving the Saudis a blank check. Supporting the Saudis
with intelligence, refueling, weaponry and minimal guidance on
protecting civilians has failed at preventing civilian
casualties]{.underline}. This policy was started by the Obama
administration and put on steroids in the age of Trump. The theory was
that by remaining engaged and involved, the United States could exercise
some influence on Saudi Arabia and drive more responsible targeting and
decision-making in Riyadh.
![https://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/thnt83/112176/0/1/0](media/image1.png){width="8.333333333333333e-3in"
height="8.333333333333333e-3in"} It has not worked out this way. The
Saudis continue to conduct the Yemeni war with insufficient regard for
civilian lives and are contributing to a worsening humanitarian crisis.
Unfortunately, there's no end to the war in sight. The U.S.
administration had made clear there will be no consequences for this
behavior when in September it certified to Congress that Saudis are
doing everything they can to avoid civilian casualties, despite obvious
evidence to the contrary. Moreover, that certification was done despite
objections from most of the State Department officials involved in the
policy. [Trump's full support of Saudi Arabia even after the Khashoggi
murder highlights why America has been stuck with these terrible policy
options in Yemen and why have Washington continued to support this
quagmire. American support has not only led to a human catastrophe but
also has done nothing to advance U.S. interests. The view inside the
U.S. government has been that Saudi Arabia is too important to alienate
and the United States does not have the leverage to change its
behavior]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia is the largest global producer of
oil in the world after the United States, a major investor in the U.S.
economy, a purchaser of billions of dollars of weapons, and one of the
most powerful countries in the Middle East---a region where all of
America's friends are imperfect. The Saudis know that even if Washington
threatened and tried to convince them otherwise, America is unlikely to
walk away from them over Yemen. [Report
Advertisement](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/give-saudi-arabia-take-it-or-leave-it-deal-37902#report-ad)
But even if President Trump is unwilling to put additional pressure on
the Kingdom, Saudi Arabia is still facing the real possibility that
domestic political pressure in the West will lead other governments to
walk away from them. Also, international businesses may curb their
investments, and in the U.S. Congress---many members of which disagree
with Trump's support of Saudi Arabia---could put harsh new restrictions
on the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Moreover, many inside the Saudi royal
family have balked at MBS's governing approach and may try to use this
moment to sideline him, putting additional pressure on him to find a way
out of the current diplomatic crisis that he and the people around him
have created. The United States should use this moment to offer Saudi
Arabia a take-it-or-leave-it deal that they may conceivably accept.
[Rather than suddenly withdrawing U.S. support for the conflict in
Yemen, Washington should offer to remain in or even become more engaged
but only if the Saudis change their approach entirely and bring the
United States into the decisionmaking process. This starts with the
Saudis sharing their strategic plans with the United States and taking
on board American recommendations for how to shift to a strategy that is
more viable and less dependent on airstrikes that harm
civilians.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia must also mitigate some of the
worst humanitarian impacts. Under closer guidance, the air war will be
carried out similarly to how the United States conducted the air war
against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. American military personnel will have a
seat at the table with their Saudi partners and an ability to veto
strikes based on humanitarian or civilian casualty concerns. [Report
Advertisement](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/give-saudi-arabia-take-it-or-leave-it-deal-37902#report-ad)
In exchange for being made a greater stakeholder, the United States will
provide more support and get more engaged. This could potentially even
include conducting certain air strikes and putting a limited number of
military advisors on the ground. This will further ensure the Saudis
meet a much higher standard when it comes to the laws of war. This
approach is not without its tradeoffs. It comes with the real risk of
further entangling America in the conflict in Yemen. Washington also has
to accept the reality that the U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria caused
significant civilian casualties, and the United States will be blamed
for similar casualties in Yemen. However, the approach we recommend and
the one the United States has pursued elsewhere is more effective and
humane than what the Saudis are doing in Yemen. American involvement
could make a meaningful difference. Americans should also have realistic
expectations. The Saudis are likely not to take Washington up on this
offer, in which case the United States should suspend military aid and
distance itself from the war in Yemen until the Saudis change their
minds or take clear steps to end the war. But given the scrutiny they
are under, the likelihood of a more flexible approach from the Crown
Prince is much higher than it was two months ago. [Even if Saudi Arabia
is a key ally in the Middle East, the United States should not give it a
blank check of support. America should use the heightened global
scrutiny on the Kingdom to take a realistic shot at getting Saudi Arabia
to change its behavior in Yemen and save thousands of lives. Such an
approach is far wiser than continuing to give the Saudis a blank check
or walking away in a fit of moral indignation.]{.underline}

The Trump administration has few options to move forward on a \$2
billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that Congress is leveraging to censure
the U.S. ally for alleged human rights abuses and to rebuke the White
House for its unconditional embrace of the kingdom. [[Raytheon
Co](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RTN:US). has been blocked from
selling precision-guided munitions kits to Saudi Arabia for more than a
year now \-- far longer than the normal hold for Congress to review an
arms sale]{.underline}. Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on
the Foreign Relations Committee, says his April 2018 block on the order
will continue until he sees evidence that this technology actually does
reduce civilian casualties by turning gravity bombs into more precise
"smart" bombs, as the administration claims. The sale is far from being
resolved since the State Department and Defense Department have yet to
provide this evidence, according to a person familiar with the proposed
sales[. Saudi Arabia's relationship with lawmakers from both parties
reached new lows last year over the kingdom's killing of U.S.-based
Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi in October and the impact that Saudi
Arabia's military campaign in Yemen is having on civilians. Attempted
Reset This tension is in stark contrast to the situation at the
beginning of Donald Trump's presidency, when the Saudi royal family
hosted his first foreign visit, replete with extravagant displays of
friendship between the two countries and promises of mutual
investment]{.underline} \-- including a package of defense deals Trump
said could be worth \$110 billion. [Trump wanted to improve ties with
Saudi Arabia after the relationship languished under his predecessor,
Barack Obama, and arms sales were a major part of that. Now, even as the
U.S. counts on its traditional ally to not only counter Iran's regional
influence but also to soften the oil supply shock of stricter Iran
sanctions, the White House has hit the limits of what it can achieve
without cooperation from Congress. The strongest bipartisan
[statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-13/senate-votes-to-defy-trump-on-yemen-setting-up-eventual-veto)
yet on U.S.-Saudi policy was a joint resolution to withdraw U.S. support
for the war in Yemen, which prompted Trump's second presidential
veto.]{.underline} It will be up to Republican leaders in the Senate to
schedule a vote to override that veto, and a spokesman for majority
leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment on when that vote will take
place. Warning Sent Even if that veto stands, as appears likely,
Republican support for the underlying resolution serves to warn the
administration against trying to force the arms sale by submitting a
formal notification to Congress without Menendez's consent. Members of
Congress would then have 30 calendar days to introduce a joint
[resolution](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL31675.pdf) of disapproval
to stop the sale. Raytheon didn't respond to a request for comment about
the status of the deal, nor did the Saudi embassy in Washington. The
State Department declined to offer an on-the-record response to
questions. The Yemen resolution was adopted with the support of 54
senators, including seven Republicans. Others like South Carolina's
Lindsey Graham, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and one of
Trump's closest allies, have spoken against any arms sales to Saudi
Arabia until the kingdom addresses Congress's concerns. U[nder a 1976
law, the State Department must notify Congress of commercial arms sales
that exceed certain thresholds for ammunition, defense construction or
defense articles and services. If the top Republican or Democrat on the
House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees have any
concerns, they can place an informal hold on the sale by refusing to
consent to the notification process. Demand for Change \"I don't think
they'll ever get arms sales through until there's a change, until
there's more accountability,\"]{.underline} Graham said in an interview,
backing up Menendez's unusually long informal hold. Dana Stroul, a
former Senate staff member, now a senior fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy, said Menendez has bipartisan support for
continuing to block the deal, which includes \$1 billion worth of
precision-guided munitions kits to the U.A.E. \"To override the ranking
member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on something like this,
I actually think a lot of Republicans would come and vote with Menendez,
not because they oppose the sale but because of the affront it would be
to Congress,\" Stroul said. [Legislation Menendez and Graham this year
re-introduced their Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act, which
includes a suspension of arms transfers to Saudi Arabia as well as
sanctions against anyone hindering humanitarian aid to Yemen or
supporting the Houthi rebels active in that country. A 2018 United
Nations investigation concluded the Saudi-led coalition may have
committed war crimes in its disregard for civilian life. With roughly
17,700 civilian casualties in the four year conflict, Congress has
hardened its attitude toward Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. \"Congress is
clearly in a bipartisan way saying 'no, we need to re-evaluate this
relationship'," with Saudi Arabia, Stroul said[. Yet the U.S. is also
counting on Saudi Arabia to
[ensure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-22/al-falih-says-saudis-to-work-with-others-to-ensure-oil-supply-jusfv1of)
adequate oil supplies after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday
there will be no more temporary waivers for other nations seeking to buy
Iran crude despite U.S. sanctions. Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, will ensure that the
oil market "does not go out of balance," Saudi Energy Minister Khalid
Al-Falih said Tuesday]{.underline}. Oil Prices The price of crude
increased 38 percent this year to a high of \$66 per barrel Tuesday as
political woes in Venezuela and Libya have crippled production and the
U.S. moves to bring Iranian oil exports to zero. Trump has closely
watching gasoline prices for U.S. consumers, and he
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1120320642686038016)
Monday that "Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the
Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil." Menendez
defended the hold on the arms sale as an effective way to encourage
Saudi Arabia to act "more constructively," along with the weight of
international opinion and the Yemen resolution. He said the kingdom is
"seeking to change course" in the coalition participating in the Yemen
conflict. Some experts, however, warn that suspending arms sales to
Saudi Arabia could push the kingdom toward more pliant suppliers such as
Russia or China. The Saudis see the Yemen conflict in \"existential
terms,\" Stroul said, and will turn to other countries in violation of
existing U.S. agreements if it means they can continue operations in
Yemen. \"[Withholding arms sales to Saudi Arabia is not going to change
their behavior,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, a senior fellow at the Center
for a New American Security. \"Eventually they will go to China and
Russia.\" There are also concerns that suspending the sale of
precision-guided munitions kits could actually cause more civilian
casualties.]{.underline} \"The Saudis depend hugely on precision-guided
missile imports from the U.S.,\" said Paul Sullivan, a Middle East
expert at Georgetown University's Center for Security Studies. \"Without
the U.S. PGMs, Saudi Arabia will have to take a different tactic. Sadly,
that will likely mean using 'dumb' missiles that can have much larger
impacts on unintended civilian and non-combatant targets. Simply put,
more people die unintentionally from dumb bombs than from PGMs.\" The
implications for civilian casualties is one of the top concerns for Jim
Risch, the Idaho Republican who with Menendez leads the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. "The Saudis are working to make the much-needed
improvements the U.S. has been trying to help them adopt," Risch said by
email. "I would hope that Senator Menendez will review all the facts
surrounding the efforts by the U.S. to limit civilian casualties using
more precise targeting mechanisms." Stroul and Goldenberg noted that the
strategy may be designed to force the Trump administration to
re-evaluate its foreign policy priorities as much as it is designed to
pressure the Saudis. Congress has been especially wary of the White
House's relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who
many lawmakers blame for Khashoggi's assassination. The hold forces the
administration \"to be out there defending a very unpopular Saudi
Arabian,\" Goldenberg said, in reference to the crown prince. \"Maybe
you get to a point where they say it's not worth it.\"

a "fistfight" while in the building, but provided few details and no
evidence. Multiple investigations are underway. The scandal has prompted

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pulled out along with heavyweight
American CEOs like Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink, the heads of Russia's

system]{.underline}. [China](https://www.cnbc.com/china/), meanwhile, is
the kingdom's largest trading partner, with \$42 billion in bilateral
trade in 2017. Last March, the two signed a raft of deals worth a
reported \$65 billion in sectors ranging from energy to space
technology. Some in Riyadh have also talked of trading oil in yuan
instead of dollars as retaliation for potential U.S. sanctions. But as

U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/trumps-trade-war-threatens-chinese-economy-china-already-has-cracks.html)

this stage to avoid further conflict with the U.S. administration.
Additionally, China is far from able to match U.S. weapons production in
terms of sophistication and capabilities, defense experts say. Beijing
sold just \$20 million in arms to the Saudis last year, compared to
\$3.4 billion in exports from the U.S., according to the Stockholm

meaningful [sanctions]{.mark} of Saudi Arabia, [we would be joking to
imagine]{.mark} that [the Saudis would just]{.mark} sit down and [accept
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Ayham Kamel, head of Eurasia Group's Middle
East and North Africa practice, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" Monday.

"[The Saudis I think will begin to tilt --- they were already doing that
beforehand --- they'll be doing more business with China and Russia. I
doubt Mr. Putin would've given the Saudis much trouble with this crisis
as Mr. Trump has]{.underline}."

Testing ties

Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post and frequent critic of
the Saudi royal family, disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate
in Istanbul on October 2. Turkish officials allege he was murdered and
dismembered by a Saudi hit squad. After initially insisting that
Khashoggi left the consulate unharmed, the Saudi government last week
said that he died in a "fistfight" while in the building, but provided
few details and no evidence. Multiple investigations are underway.

The scandal has prompted scores of ministers and CEOs to withdraw from a
major international summit being held this week in Riyadh, aimed at
showcasing Saudi Arabia's investment opportunities. But while U.S.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pulled out along with heavyweight
American CEOs like Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink, the heads of Russia's
direct investment fund (RDIF) will still be in attendance.

ABU DHABI---[[Russia and China are stepping up their efforts to

[**[The market is crucial for the global defense industry]{.mark}, with
Saudi Arabiaʼs \$[7.7 billion in 2018 deals]{.mark} making it [the

[[Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. spent \$40 million each on Chinese

[Russia has sold missile systems to the U.A.E. and military rifles to

[[Russia\'s share of the Middle East defence market has doubled]{.mark}
in three years]{.underline}, establishing a foothold in one of the
world\'s most lucrative defense markets. Who stands to gain or lose?

Subject: [Ever since the country's military campaign in Syria, interest
in Russia's defence offerings has grown, prompting **a struggle for
influence in the region with the US.**]{.underline}

[Ever since the beginning of its intervention in Syria, Russia's
engagement with the Middle East has been steadily on the
rise.]{.underline}

Syria offered the Russian military a priceless opportunity: a
conventional testing ground for its defence industry.

Since then, interest in Russian defence offerings has only grown.

Alexander Mikheyev, CEO of Russian defence firm Rosoboronexport admitted
as much, while speaking to TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency.

\"The demand is rather significant after Syria's events,\" he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has also taken the same line.

"Syria is not a shooting range for Russian weapons, but we are still
using them there, our new weapons," Putin said.

"This has led to the improvement of modern strike systems, including
missile systems. It is one thing to have them, and quite another thing
to see how they fare in combat conditions," clarified the Russian
president.

New Milestones

But this year, [[Russian defence exports have reached]{.mark} new
heights of exposure, making a splash [at]{.mark} the]{.underline}
International Defence Exhibition and Conference ([[IDEX]{.mark}), the
Middle East's largest defence [summit]{.mark}]{.underline}, held
annually in the United Arab Emirates.

IDEX has always been a key event for defence companies around the world,
but is increasingly vital to Russian weapons manufacturers in recent
years, [[as sanctions slowly restrict their access to American and
European markets]{.mark}. Where can [they make up for lost
business]{.mark}? [Among]{.mark} the oil-rich deserts of [the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline}.

More than 50 Russian companies are presenting their wares at IDEX this
year.

Sergey Chemezov, CEO of Rostec Corporation told the Russian Tass news
agency: "For us, Middle Eastern and North African countries are
extremely important markets where we implement numerous projects both in
the civilian sector and in defence."

"In total, about 1,000 exhibits will be on display," he confirmed.

Last year, Russian companies took up nearly 1,400 square meters of space
to showcase their products.

The Middle East isn't the only place where there's money to be made for
Russia, although it may be the most profitable. Other notable markets
include China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia.

This year, [the [Middle East's leaders]{.mark} and generals [will see
new defence offerings]{.mark}, beyond the usual]{.underline} Su-35 and
MiG-29 fighter jets, [small arms]{.underline} and tanks usually pushed
by Russia.

[Foremost amongst them is [the Pantsir-ME]{.mark} shipborne air defence
missile and artillery system]{.underline}, which was demonstrated during
IDEX 2019. Its specifications, if accurate, are impressive.

The Pantsir-ME [can be mounted on any ship displacing more than 300
tonnes, featuring agile missile complements and two high-velocity
machine guns]{.underline}. The system is unique in that **[it [can be
used to cheaply upgrade any fleet]{.mark}, offering an all-in-one
offensive and defensive fire package]{.underline}**.

**[[The system can be used autonomously]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or as
part of a network throughout a vessel. It can also be installed on
smaller corvettes, frigates, or destroyers.

A Russian statement claims that the system missile complement can
simultaneously fire at four targets with a distance of 20 kilometres and
a ceiling of 15 kilometres.

If they miss the first time, Russia claims "the target will be hit by
artillery fire with a 100 percent guarantee".

How? With a "completely automated" learning process that includes target
acquisition, aiming, and firing.

The advertised fire-and-forget features are undoubtedly attractive to
third-world militaries who already face the high-bar of difficulty that
comes with creating a navy without the naval traditions and experiences
established navies benefit from.

[Other Russian offerings include the AK-47, a common sight in Middle
Eastern conflicts due to its low cost and ruggedness]{.underline}, since
[updated with the new AK200]{.underline}, a sleeker, modern variant.

Russia is currently the second-largest arms supplier worldwide.

In 2018, Rostec and its subsidiary, Rosoboronexport, supplied arms and
military equipment to over 40 countries worldwide, amounting to a total
of \$20 billion in trade.

The Middle East and North Africa alone were responsible for more than 40
percent of Rosoboronexport's business. This is up from 20 percent only
two years prior.

The Middle East's appetite for arms has definitely increased. Currently,
the region leads the world by purchased volume of weapons, making up
nearly one-third of the global market.

**[Saudi Arabia looks towards Russia]{.underline}**

Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt, the UAE and Qatar are on the top of the
list major defence buyers. Saudi Arabia remains the top importer,
responsible for a growing share of business with Russia.

According to Rostec's CEO, Saudi Arabia is currently in talks with
Russia to purchase the S400 missile systems.

This came following a bilateral agreement reached during a visit by
Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz to Moscow in October 2017, marking the
first visit by a Saudi monarch to Russia.

Russia's Sputnik also reported that **[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} would
[finalise a deal to domestically produce Russian]{.mark} Kalashnikov
[rifles by]{.mark} the end of February [2019]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Militarisation in the UAE

**[[Russia's biggest client]{.mark} this year [was]{.mark} none other
than [the UAE.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[[It signed defence deals to acquire more than **\$5.4 billion**]{.mark}
in arms and military equipment]{.underline} during the IDEX conference,
[[in spite of ongoing calls to end the war in Yemen]{.mark}, in which
the UAE plays a leading role.]{.underline}

At least [[**\$1.9 billion** was allocated to deals with US
firms]{.underline}]{.mark} Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to purchase air
defence missiles, according to a Reuters report.

Rosoboronexport Director General Alexander Mikheev told reporters that
[Russia had received a request from the UAE to modernise its Pantsir-S1
systems]{.underline}.

This is [in addition to a separate purchase of Russian Kornet-E
anti-tank missile systems worth \$40 million]{.underline}, according to
a statement by UAE Brigadier General Mohammed Al Hassani.

[Saudi Arabia aims to build a defense industry at breakneck speed, and
it's ready to look beyond its traditional Western allies for
help]{.underline}.

The oil-rich kingdom has long been a favorite customer of arms sellers,
especially American ones. President Donald Trump announced \$110 billion
in deals during his trip there last year. Now, [32 year-old Crown Prince
[M]{.mark}ohammed [b]{.mark}in [S]{.mark}alman [wants to make weapons at
home]{.mark}, and he's set an ambitious goal: **[Half of Saudi
procurement]{.mark} is supposed [to be done locally by
2030]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from about 2 percent today.

The Saudis will need partners \-- which means opportunities for Western
companies, who were energetically exploring them at an arms fair in
Riyadh this week. But there's a potential catch. [For joint ventures to
work, [U.S. and European governments may have to sign off on transfers
of technology.]{.mark}]{.underline}

'Other Partners'

[[In case they're reluctant to do so, the Saudis]{.mark} are making it
clear that they have other options.]{.underline} [They're already
[planning to buy the]{.mark} Russian [S-400 air-defense system, under a
deal that would let them manufacture]{.mark} related products [at
home]{.mark}]{.underline}. The prospect of more such agreements is
likely to alarm American policy makers, who worry about losing ground to
Russia and China in the Middle East.

"We will very carefully evaluate what our partners can bring to the
table," Andreas Schwer, head of Saudi Arabian Military Industries or
SAMI, said in an interview Tuesday at the Riyadh fair.

"[We won't hesitate to go to second-tier suppliers or other potential
partners, if they have full governmental support and no
restrictions]{.underline}," said Schwer, previously an executive at
German defense group Rheinmetall AG. Saudi Arabia "could end up with
other partners," and with less U.S. involvement than some people would
like, he said.

Filling the Gaps

One of those people just delivered a warning to Congress on precisely
this issue.

[[**Russia and China are seeking "to fill in perceived gaps** in U.S.
interest by increasing defense cooperation and sales of their equipment
to our regional partners]{.mark},]{.underline}" General Joseph Votel,
the head of U.S. Central Command, told the House Armed Services
Committee on Feb. 27.

[Russia's influence in the Middle East has soared since 2015, when its
military intervention in Syria swung the civil wa]{.underline}r in
President Bashar al-Assad's favor. China's economic role in the region
is expanding, as it signs deals with Iran and seeks to get involved in
rebuilding Syria.

Unlike America, [the Saudis have cordial ties with China and
Russia]{.underline}. The former is one of its best oil customers, and
the latter increasingly its partner in regulating world oil output.

Both countries are competing with a U.S.-backed group, headed by
Westinghouse Electric Co., to win nuclear-power contracts in the
kingdom. And both have expressed interest in getting a piece of the
action when the Saudis put a stake in Aramco up for sale. (So has Trump,
who tweeted that the oil giant's IPO should be in New York.)

'Many Have Reconsidered'

To be sure, Saudi-U.S. ties have deeper roots. They stretch back to
before World War II. And Trump has assured Saudi leaders that he's keen
to sign more defense deals.

But close relations have been accompanied by skepticism on the American
side about Saudi military capabilities. Doubts have been fueled by the
kingdom's struggle to defeat poorly equipped rebels in Yemen, over three
years of war that have taken a heavy civilian toll. Some members of
Congress have opposed weapons deals with the Saudis, and transfers of
nuclear technology.

One longtime U.S. ally in the neighborhood has already angered
Washington by switching arms suppliers.

NATO member Turkey is buying the S-400 from Russia. During a visit last
month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made his opposition clear.

[America has been "advising countries around the world" that **they
could fall afoul of U.S. sanctions by going ahead with arms purchases
from Russia**]{.underline}, Tillerson said. "Many have reconsidered."

### Link\-\--Taiwan

#### Russia fills in for the U.S. --- Turkey and Vietnam prove --- turns the war advantage because the U.S. can't come to Taiwan's defense and wrecks deterrence

SH

These are valid concerns. [But as Russia and China actively pursue
weapons sales as part of an aggressive strategy to expand their spheres
of influence, U.S. strategic interests must be given more
weight.]{.underline}

Over the past decade, [[Russia has easily maintained its position as the
worldʼs second-largest weapons supplier]{.mark}, comprising 22% of
global sales from 2013-17]{.underline}. Chinese arms exports increased
by nearly 40% from 2013-17 compared with the previous four years, the
largest increase for any large exporter country except Israel, according
to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. [Neither Russia
nor China has qualms about selling weapons to even brazen human-rights
violators]{.underline}. In fact they often provide the technologies
authoritarian governments use to surveil and repress their citizens.
**[And [they are]{.mark} especially [eager to peel off countries the
U.S. has declined to arm]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Russia sells aircraft, submarines, antiaircraft systems and
missiles]{.underline}. China has made strides in advanced missile
systems as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. **[[The sale of these
sophisticated weapo]{.mark}ns poses a direct threat to U.S. security
interests. It also [creates challenges around
interoperability]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Technologies developed by the
Russians and Chinese---such as advanced radars, sonars, sensors and
communications platforms---cannot integrate effectively with U.S.
technologies. [[The more a country purchases from Russia]{.mark} or
China, [the less able it is to purchase from the U.S]{.mark}. in the
future, pushing a country further out of Americaʼs security
orbit.]{.underline} **[The lack of interoperability [would also present
major obstacles if the U.S. needed tofight a war alongside an
ally]{.mark} whose advanced military equipment had been sourced from
Russia or China.]{.underline}**

[[Countries cut off by the U.S. will still be able to purchase advanced
systems]{.mark}. Worse, they will be able to do so [without depending on
the U.S. for maintenance, ammunition or spare
parts]{.mark}]{.underline}. This eliminates a key lever for U.S.
influence in the event that human-rights abuses occur, for instance.

[Take [Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In 2016 and 2017 it had
been attempting to purchase helicopters and other technology from U.S.
manufacturers, but was turned down due to concerns around deteriorating
governance. Then in late 2017 [it [acquired a]{.mark} sophisticated
[missile-defense system from Russia]{.mark} for \$2.5 billion, an
unprecedented move for a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization]{.underline}.

[Vietnamʼs relations with the U.S. have been pleasantly thawing, partly
because of a common concern around Chinaʼs aggressiveness in the Indo-
Pacific region]{.underline}. The U.S. lifted its arms embargo on Vietnam
in 2016, but residual concerns about human rights have largely limited
sales to sonars and radars. In addition [[the U.S. has not provided
meaningful military assistance to Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark} to help
offset costs. As a result, [[Vietnam continues to purchase]{.mark} much
of [its military equipment from Russia]{.mark}, which often subsidizes
the transactions]{.underline}.

#### Russia is seeking to diversify its arms sales in Southeast Asia

To great fanfare, in May 2016, [[Russia hosted the third
ASEAN]{.mark}-Russia [Summit]{.mark}]{.underline} at the Black Sea
resort of Sochi. Commemorating the 20th anniversary of Russia's
acceptance as an ASEAN dialog partner, [this summit was intended [to
give new impetus to]{.mark} longstanding efforts by Russia and Southeast
Asia to [forge]{.mark} closer [economic and security
ties]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Defying efforts by the West to
isolate Russia, leaders from all ten ASEAN member states attended the
summit.\[1\] Despite having recently skipped several high-level ASEAN
summits, this time President Putin led the Russian delegation himself.
He also met separately with the leaders of all ten ASEAN states. After
the summit, Putin proclaimed that the two sides had reached agreement
"on building a strategic partnership over the long term." Demonstrating
that [this was not just mere rhetoric, the two sides also announced a
raft of new measures during the summit, on topics ranging from security
relations to closer political and economic ties.]{.underline} However,
Russia's ongoing Sino-centric focus, ASEAN's limited ability to act
collectively, and Moscow's preference for bilateral relations will
continue to predominate in its overall relations with the region.

A Pivot Toward Eastern Relationships?

[In the aftermath of renewed conflict with the West over Ukraine,
[Russia sought to accelerate its much-discussed "turn to the
East"]{.mark} in a bid to avoid isolation and [to **circumvent Western
sanctions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This initiative, which was first
launched after the 2008 financial crisis, was intended to allow Russia
to reduce its dependence on the West, while harnessing the dynamic
growth of the Asia-Pacific region as a means for modernizing the Russian
Far East and ultimately Russia itself. [The first concrete action to
this effect was Russia hosting the APEC]{.underline} (Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation) summit in Vladivostok in 2012, followed by an
acceleration in efforts to increase economic cooperation. [[While Russia
has consistently placed the highest priority on increasing its ties with
China, it also sought to diversify]{.mark} its relations with other Asia
Pacific countries **in order [to avoid becoming]{.mark} overly
[dependent]{.mark} on Beijing**. Southeast Asia figured prominently in
this effort]{.underline}, as Russia sought to build upon its existing
relations with countries in the region, especially Vietnam, Indonesia,
and Myanmar, to maintain its strategic independence. **[I[n a move
reminiscent of its recent policy in the Middle East, it]{.mark} also
[sought to expand relations]{.mark} with countries long considered U.S.
allies]{.underline}** such as the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand.

The pivot to Asia came to include three components:

a civilizational alliance against Western "universal values";

a geopolitical effort to provide a regional alternative to the
U.S.-centered alliance system; and

a geo-economic push to integrate Russia into Asia's dynamic economy.

Given local power dynamics, China has inevitably played the largest role
in all of these components and will continue to do so in the future.
Nevertheless, the region's other states have received increased
attention from Russia as well. Overall, however, this pivot has proven
to be relatively long on rhetoric but rather short on concrete actions,
with numerous discussions of Russia needing to engage with a dynamic
Asia but few efforts to move beyond limited economic cooperation.

While Russian rhetoric frequently highlighted the need to deepen
relations with countries other than China, Russian foreign policy toward
Asia has remained deeply Sino-centric. To the extent they have taken
place, Russian efforts to expand relations beyond China have focused on
East Asian countries and on India, with Southeast Asia very much in the
bottom tier of Russian priorities in the Asia-Pacific region. At the
same time, Russia's interest in the region has been growing, in part for
the potential economic benefits of expanded trade but primarily for
geopolitical reasons. Increasing Russian influence in Southeast Asia can
help Moscow to both balance its increasingly evident junior partner role
vis-à-vis China and to negatively affect U.S. efforts to expand its
reach beyond its traditional allies in the region.

Russia-Southeast Asia Relations: A Low Baseline

Achieving greater integration with Southeast Asia will not be easy,
however, as Russia is starting from a relatively low baseline. While its
relations with the region have been gradually improving, Russia is still
not that significant a player in Southeast Asia. Moreover, the region is
beholden to Russian relations with China and is still of secondary
priority when compared to Russian efforts to maintain its position in
Europe and the former Soviet republics and to increase its role in the
Middle East.

At the regional level, Russia's relations with Southeast Asia have been
dominated by its relations with ASEAN, but its relations with the
association remain relatively weak. Since gaining admission in 2011,
Moscow has consistently failed to capitalize on its ASEAN membership
either to deepen its engagement with the states of Southeast Asia
themselves or to increase its involvement in the broader ASEAN-led
Asia-Pacific regional integration process. Nor has Russia been all that
significant a factor in the economic domain. While its trade in natural
resources, energy technology, and transportation with Southeast Asia has
been increasing steadily, Russia's economic relations with ASEAN remain
relatively frail overall. In 2017, for example, Russia ranked eighth
among ASEAN's major trading partners, with total bilateral trade
accounting for just 0.7 percent of ASEAN's total trade turnover.

[[Russia has been more successful in increasing]{.mark} its [security
ties wit]{.mark}h some of the [countries in Southeast
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}. It has succeeded, for example, in
establishing a close security relationship with Vietnam, its long-time
Cold War ally. **[[Russia has also been a major supplier of advanced
military equipment for the region]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially for
Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In areas other than arms sales,
however, Russia's security relationship with countries in Southeast Asia
still remains fairly limited. While the states in the region would
welcome Russia's playing a greater security role, especially in
soft-balancing against China and the United States, it continues to lack
the economic, political, and military clout needed to effectively
fulfill this role.

BEIRUT --- [Two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union affirmed
the United States as the dominant power in the Middle East, **[a
resurgent Russia is seeking ways]{.mark} large and small [to fill the
vacuum left by the departure of American troops]{.mark}**]{.underline}
from Iraq and the toppling of U.S. allies in the Arab Spring revolts.

The recent diplomacy that averted a U.S. strike on Syria underscored the
extent to which Moscow's steadfast support for its last remaining Arab
ally has helped reassert Russia's role. Russian President Vladimir Putin
has emerged as the world leader with the single biggest influence over
the outcome of a raging war that is threatening the stability of the
wider region, winning concessions from both President Bashar al-

Assad and President Obama to secure a U.N. resolution requiring Syria to
surrender its chemical weapons arsenal.

Less conspicuously, **[[Russia has been nurturing new alliances]{.mark}
and reviving old friendships further afield, reaching out to countries
[long regarded as being within the American sphere of
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** in ways that echo the superpower
rivalries of the Cold War era.

[Those countries include Egypt and Iraq, traditional Arab heavyweights
that have been exploring closer ties with Moscow]{.underline} at a time
when the Obama administration has signaled a reluctance to become too
deeply embroiled in the region's turmoil.

In his address to the United Nations last week, Obama stressed that he
does not regard the Middle East or the conflict in Syria as an arena of
competition with Washington's bygone foe.

"This is not a zero-sum endeavor. We are no longer in a Cold War.
There's no Great Game to be won," Obama said, referring to an earlier
period of big-power rivalry in which the British Empire and Russia's
czars vied for influence across Central Asia.

Whether Russia is equally determined not to compete with the United
States in the strategically vital region is in question, however, Arab
analysts say.

Saudi Arabia, the region's strongest Arab power and Washington's
staunchest Arab ally, is deeply suspicious of Russia's maneuvering and
is convinced that Moscow is engaged in an effort to outwit the United
States at Riyadh's expense, said Mustafa Alani of the Dubai-based Gulf

The overtures between the United States and Iran, a close Moscow ally,
further reinforce anxieties in Riyadh and other Persian Gulf capitals
that Russia is seeking to eclipse the U.S. role in the region, Alani
said.

"The view is that Russia is looking at the whole problem in the Middle
East from the old position of the Cold War," he said. "Wherever America
is, they have to spoil the game. They don't have any principles. Their
only policy is to counter the Americans."

That is not the case, said Fyodor Lukyanov, chairman of the Moscow-­based
Council on Foreign and Defense Policy. Rather, Lukyanov said in an
e-mail, it is Saudi Arabia and its gulf allies that "are trying to play
great games themselves . . . and arrogantly casting stones in a glass
house."

[[Russian intentions]{.mark} in the region are rooted in many concerns,
but foremost among them is Moscow's determination "to [emphasize
Russia's role in the world as an indispensable nation]{.mark},
especially vis-a-vis American helplessness to settle
problems]{.underline}," he said.

The intent is being felt. [Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki]{.underline}, who became premier three years after the 2003
U.S.-led invasion, [has made two trips to Moscow in the past year and
none to Washington. His talks were focused on a \$4 billion defense deal
under which Russia will supply Iraq with a range of armaments, including
fighter jets, which are expected to be delivered soon]{.underline}.

The size of the deal is dwarfed by the more than \$18 billion worth of
arms deals concluded between Baghdad and Washington over the past eight
years. But key elements of those --- including coveted F-16 fighter jets
--- have yet to arrive.

[[Iraqi officials say they turned to Moscow only because they were
frustrated by the slow pace of U.S. arms deliveries]{.mark} at a time
when the conflict in neighboring Syria has heightened anxieties about
Iraq's stability]{.underline}.

Russia, concerned about escalating violence in Iraq, "sees a vacuum
there, which she is trying to fill," Lukyanov said.

Meanwhile, [[strains between Egypt's]{.mark} new military-backed rulers
[and Washington have led]{.mark} Egyptian leaders [to]{.mark} encourage
[Russian advances]{.mark}]{.underline}. A Russian tourism delegation
came to the country to explore ways of expanding visits by Russians at a
time when most Westerners have been staying away, and interim Egyptian
Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy, a former ambassador to Washington, chose
Moscow for his first visit beyond the region in his new job.

[[If the U.S. were to terminate arms sales to the ROC, the latter might
attempt to procure weapons from alternative
sources]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, over the years the ROC has been
encouraged by the U.S. to purchase arms from other pro-western
governments. [Unfortunately for the ROC, [\"most tradi- tional European
arms suppliers have shunned Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, rather
than risk Peking\'s counter-pressure.\"16 In recent years, [the PRC has
succeeded in frustrating the ROC in its attempts to purchase Rapier
missiles from the U.K., Sondra-3 rockets from Brazil, and Franco-Italian
antiship missiles]{.underline}. In the latter case, the PRC was able to
exert enough pressure to thwart the attempted weapons purchase even
after the contract had been signed. Finally, [even if the ROC is able to
purchase weapons from pro- western sources, in the future it may not be
able to secure the required additional or spare parts]{.underline}. This
problem is well exemplified by the ROC\'s inability to secure spare
parts for the three Italian midget submarines it purchased in 1976.

[There is, however, one major weapons producer which is not likely to
bow to pressure from the PRC: the Soviet Union.]{.underline} The Soviet
Union would be anxious to develop close ties with the ROC for two
reasons. First, [[the Soviet Union does not want to see the
reunification of China]{.underline}]{.mark}. PRC acquisition of the
technological know-how of the ROC military com- bined with the modern
research and development facilities in Taiwan would represent a major
boost to PRC military capabilities. [It is in the best interest of the
Soviet Union, therefore, to prevent the ROC from being pressured into a
reunification with the mainland]{.underline}. Second[, **[should the
Soviet Union succeed in establishing itself as a]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[major [weapons supplier to the ROC,]{.mark} it might be able
to [exercise its]{.mark} relatively [superior bargaining
position]{.mark} in order to wrest concessions from Taipei.
It]{.underline}** is axiomatic that \"[the acqui- sition of naval
facilities on Taiwan would represent a major gain for Soviet naval power
in the Pacific]{.underline}.\" 17

Responding to public discussion of such a policy shift, Chiang Ching-
kuo has specifically stated that \"the ROC would not establish ties with
the Soviet Union because the Republic\'s national policy (is)
anti-communist.\" 18 Nevertheless, [[the USSR and the ROC have
cooperated in the past, and in recent years the two governments have
been in communication]{.underline}]{.mark} again. For example, in the
mid-1970s, Soviet agent Victor Louis was sent to the ROC in an
unsuccessful attempt to negotiate the lease of naval facilities in the
Pescadores. Although Louis failed, some analysts have argued that [this
meeting signaled the opening of a new dialogue between the ROC and the
USSR]{.underline}. It might also be noted that Foreign Minister Chou
Shu-kai, dismissed by the elder Chiang following his public pronounce-
ments about increased ROC-USSR cooperation in the early 1970s, has been
resurrected by Chiang Ching-kuo and now serves as the ROC\'s only
ambassador in Europe (Ambassador to the Vatican).

**[[If the ROC chose to enter into]{.mark} some sort of [association
with the USSR]{.mark}, it is fairly safe to assume that many [U.S. goals
and objectives in the region would be at risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Even more worrisome is the likelihood that regional tensions would
accelerate. [One cannot assume that the PRC would sit idly by and watch
as Taiwan was transformed into something resembling an \"Asian
Cuba.\"]{.underline} Should Taiwan choose to play the so-called
\"Russian card,\" the PRC might very well decide to pursue its military
option. Such an action, undertaken when the ROC and the USSR had entered
into an agreement, might very well escalate into a major conflict. One
may only speculate what role the United States might play.

### Link\-\--Taiwan\-\--Relations Possible

#### Closer Russia-Taiwan relations are possible because of Russian economic interests 

**Tang '18 ---** May 2, 2018, Anton Tang graduated from the Graduate
Institute of Russian Studies, National Chengchi University (NCCU),

The example of the Taiwan-Russia Association\'s visit to Russia in 2002
shows that Russia is sticking to the principle of "pragmatism" when it
comes to dealing with international issues: [[The national interest is
Russia's most crucial consideration]{.mark}**. Against this backdrop,
[Taiwan can,]{.mark} of course, look for room to [seek closer contacts
with Russia, as long as such endeavors contribute to Russia's economic
development]{.mark}**]{.underline} and do not cross Russia's "one China
principle" line.

In terms of the current structure of bilateral trade, years of
interaction based on "comparative advantage" and "factor endowment
theory" have led to a fixed palette of import and export items. Yet, [if
recent industrial development in both countries is taken into account,
[greater breakthroughs should be possible in bilateral trade]{.mark} --
various fields such as agriculture, high-tech products and the aerospace
industry are all waiting to be developed.]{.underline}

Finally, from a strategic perspective, Taiwan could take advantage of
the dialogue mechanisms created in various fields by international
organizations in which Taiwan and Russia both are members, such as APEC
and the WTO. It should also closely watch the cooperation opportunities
resulting from Russia's massive promotion of the "Eurasian Economic
Union" in recent years and ponder whether it should emulate the
Vietnamese example in participating in that trading bloc.

To put it simply, [[the best way for Taiwan to **sidestep the "China
factor"**]{.mark} and directly develop its ties with Russia [is by
actively using the cooperation frameworks offered by international
organizations]{.mark}]{.underline} such as APEC and the WTO; the
"Eurasian Economic Union" is currently the most promising choice for
future development.

#### Taiwan-Russia relations are increasing despite Chinese pressure

In recent months, relations between Taiwan and Russia have been steadily
increasing, with the trend of warming ties between the two countries
expected to continue.

In a report from Voice of America (VOA), [[a commentator on Russian
affairs outlined how ties between Taiwan and Russia]{.mark} are
beginning to [look very promising]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

In early May, [[direct flights between Taiwan and Russia were
established]{.mark} for the first time in the history of the two
countries]{.underline}, with routes between Taoyuan International
Airport and Moscow, as well as the eastern city of Vladivostok.

The direct flights come almost a year after Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) introduced visa waivers for Russian citizens in September
2018, in a bid to increase tourism and business from the country.

Currently the visa waiver program is set to end on July 31, 2019, but if
the direct flight routes prove to be successful during their first two
months, MOFA is reportedly considering extending the visa waiver.

[VOA reports that some [businessmen in Russia are hopeful that Taiwan
can become an important trading partner]{.mark} with the federation,
which might surpass Russia's annual trade with Cypress in the
Mediterranean]{.underline}. The report also suggests that **[[the
Russian government is tacitly supporting improved ties with Taiwan,
despite what many see as Russia's lose partnership with
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### Link\-\--Taiwan\-\--A2: Relations Possible

#### Russia and China are competitors, *[not]{.underline}* collaborators 

**Wezeman '17** --- July 5, 2019, Siemon Wezeman is a Senior Researcher

Russia and the shifting landscape of arms sales," Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, Accessed 7/9/19,
https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2017/china-russia-and-shifting-landscape-arms-sales

[After almost five years of difficult negotiations, Russia and China
moved to a new level of arms trade in 2015]{.underline}. Russia finally
agreed to sell China 24 Sukhoi‑35 (Su-35) combat aircraft and four S-400
SAM systems for approximately USD \$7 billion. These are currently among
the most advanced weapons Russia produces. This agreement marked a
turning point. It was the first significant sale of Russian major
weapons to China since the mid-2000s, representing a sizeable addition
to Russia's total annual value of arms exports, which has hovered
between USD \$13.5 billion and USD \$15 billion in recent years.

The agreement could herald a new phase of large sales of Russia's most
sophisticated arms to China. However[, it could also be viewed as a last
chance for Russia to gain some income from arms sales to China before
the latter becomes self-sufficient]{.underline}. The first scenario
would fit the picture of warming Russian--Chinese relations, following
the crisis in Ukraine. The second scenario is more tightly bound to
Russian financial hardships and the difficulties in its arms industry
since 2015. **[[This sale could]{.mark} well [be the last chance for
Russia to engage in a major sale]{.mark} of military equipment to
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the same time as the Su-35 and S-400
are due for delivery, [[China]{.mark} will be [introducing its
own]{.mark} more [advanced]{.mark} Jian-20 ([J-20)]{.mark} combat
aircraft, as well as its own advanced [jet engines, large transport
aircraft, helicopters and]{.mark} long-range [SAM
systems]{.mark}---**many of which are on a par with or even [better than
Russian systems]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

When it comes to the arms trade, **[[China has not only learned from
Russia, but succeeded in challenging it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Given
its financial and defence industrial base, [China is likely to have more
chances to develop new military technologies than Russia]{.underline}.
China's electronics, composites, advanced materials and shipbuilding
industries are all more advanced than those in Russia. The size of the
Chinese economy means that it has many more resources and much more
manpower to invest in research and development. Thus, [it is more than
likely that China's military technology will surpass that of Russia on
all levels]{.underline}.

In the early 2000s the Kremlin began expanding areas of cooperation with
Turkey, a NATO member, and these included modest arms contracts.\[lxxv\]
But [in September 2017, in the context of deteriorating relations with

\$2.5 billion [deal]{.mark}, Ankara's first major arms agreement [with
Russia, to purchase the S-400 missile
system]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[lxxvi\] The deal raises several questions.
First, the Russian system is not compatible with NATO systems. Second,
it is unclear how Turkey intends to use the S-400. Some question whether
the deal will go through at all, but the fact of the matter is, the
signing alone is significant. [[It shows]{.mark} how much influence
Putin has gained with [the NATO ally]{.mark}, who for years now
[has]{.mark} increasingly [turned away from Western democratic

purchasing F-35s. However, concerns about Israeli security, codified in
laws mandating the preservation of Israel's military advantage (see
"Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME)"), have been cited in some
reports as a reason for the United States' not selling F-35s to the
Emiratis, at least for several years after Israel receives its own
F-35s.69 As a result, [[the Emiratis have]{.mark} evidently [been
looking elsewhere, specifically Russia]{.mark}, for advanced combat
aircraft]{.underline}. Media reporting indicates that the two nations
signed an agreement in the spring of 2017 to develop a fifth-generation
fighter jet, along with a separate purchase by the UAE of Russian Sukhoi
Su-35 fighters.70 It is unclear whether the UAE actually intends to
implement the agreement or is more interested in gaining U.S.
concessions on F-35s or other possible transactions due to U.S. concerns
regarding Russia-UAE arms dealings. 71 In addition, after being rebuffed

Furthermore, [if weapons sales are the next great game, then China is
barely on the scoreboard]{.underline}. [Alarmists should recognize that
despite China's 143 percent increase in weapons sales over the last five
years, it still only represents 5 percent of the global arms
market]{.underline}. Russia, the world's second-largest producer, has a
27 percent global market share while US exports make up 31 percent. In
fact, from an economic and geopolitical perspective, Chinese weapons
sales are competing far more directly with Russian than American
transfers. Both Russia and China tend to sell weapons known for their
reliability, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness --- putting them in
competition for trade with poorer countries. On the other hand, Cliff
points out that [American foreign policy has effectively "locked up"
many major weapons markets]{.underline}, including South Korea, Israel,
and Japan. [As a result, Russia and China are left to compete for market
space]{.underline} --- and by extension, influence --- among the
nonaligned countries of the developing world. **[Even there, China is
struggling]{.underline}** to corner the market. According to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China is currently the
dominant arms dealer in just three African countries: South Sudan,
Tanzania, and Zambia. While weapons sales are hardly the defining factor
in the relationship between two countries, it is clear that even in
South Sudan, where China enjoys an unusually monopolistic relationship
in weapons sales, Beijing's ability to influence decision-making is
limited. In a rare divergence from an espoused policy of noninterference
in Africa, China committed 800 soldiers to South Sudan as part of a UN
peacekeeping mission. Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, said that the
commitment of troops was "the responsibility and duty of a responsible
power and not because of China's own interests." However, a report by
the research group Small Arms Survey revealed that China was also
backing a 700-strong militia in the Unity State --- South Sudan's
oil-producing region --- in order to safeguard an oil field. For
Beijing, an end to the war would be a win twice over, proving to the
world that China is capable of being a geopolitical leader while
restoring a semblance of normality conducive to trade. But despite
repeated attempts at intervention and mediation, China has struggled to
bring its influence to bear in conclusively ending the civil war. Though
[China]{.underline} [is]{.underline} still, [in many ways, taking its
first steps as a world power, its struggling aspirations]{.underline}
for responsible stewardship [in Africa are proof that economic ties are
not the sole pillar of diplomacy]{.underline}. The wariness of nations
in China's own backyard is testament to this. On account of its
vacillations between indifference and belligerence, China's foreign
policy has failed to foster trust with its neighbors. It is unclear to
what extent China has attempted to use weapons sales to cultivate
relationships with neighboring states, but its perceived aggressions in
the South China Sea have certainly had a far more negative impact on
regional relations than "friendship prices" on pistols are capable of
making up for. **[Asian nations don't turn to China]{.underline}** ---
the regional power and a country that they should have every economic
incentive to cooperate with --- [as their sole provider of
weapons.]{.underline} While many of the less wealthy Asia-Pacific
nations buy with a relative lack of distinction between the United
States, China, and Russia, the region's wealthier countries --- and
major players in the South China Sea dispute --- import their weapons
primarily from the United States. And unlike nations that share borders
with the United States and Russia, [no Chinese neighbor,]{.underline}
with the exception of Myanmar, [buys weapons in any significant quantity
from Beijing]{.underline}.

While some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or
China, might eventually create a world-leading defense industry, it will
remain out of the grasp of most states. [Consider China, an
unquestionable economic powerhouse of recent decades]{.underline}.
[Despite decades of arms purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse
engineering attempts, and hundreds of billions of dollars, **China still
turns to Russia**]{.underline} [for help with]{.underline} the most
[advanced weaponry such as fighter jets, helicopters, surface-to-air
missiles, radars, and jet engines]{.underline}. If [China]{.underline},
the second largest economy in the world [struggles]{.underline} so
[mightily]{.underline}, what threat do smaller, less capable states
pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of basic scientific knowledge
and expertise crafted over decades, cannot simply be uploaded, emailed
to another state, or hacked. Rather, it takes decades of intentional and
costly investment. For high-end weaponry, where research and development
costs remain a prohibitive barrier to entry, the United States and a
handful of other advanced economies are likely to remain in the driver's
seat; even with generous technology transfer agreements.

#### The PLA will block the sale of advanced weapons

[So far]{.underline}, it would seem that [the influx of Chinese weapons
has had relatively little effect on the global balance of
power]{.underline}. Even among African nations where China is the sole
supplier, Cliff points out that "these countries don't have a lot of
cash, so you're looking at a small number of weapons." But wars of the
21st Century are rarely fought with the parity of the 20th. As Chinese
weapons and weapon systems --- notably their guided missile technology
--- advance, the impact of China's dealings with more volatile
governments may start to have a larger effect, particularly in domestic
clashes, which have comprised 90 percent of the world's conflicts in the
last 25 years. While this trend may be a relative, if cynical, plus for
geopolitical stability, China's apolitical sale of weapons will continue
to fuel conflicts of the most appalling nature. However, [Cliff warns
that it is "too early to tell" what the effect of China's narrowing the
technological gap will have on the global distribution of weapon
technology, since the People's Liberation Army **continues to block**
the sale of the most advanced weapons outside of China]{.underline}.

in 2012 -- and hastened when Russia's military actions in Crimea and
Syria prompted a flood of sanctions from the West. Yet, without the
economic dynamism of China or the US, analysts say Russia's toolset for
projecting and accumulating influence abroad is limited. Even in the
energy sector, resource-rich Russia has not kept pace in the
Asia-Pacific with exports from China, the US and other regional energy
producers. A strong military is necessary for an independent foreign
policy Vasily Kashin, a senior fellow at the National Research
University in Moscow [Russia retains a marked edge with its
military]{.underline}, however, [which is the second strongest and most
technologically advanced globally, behind only the US]{.underline}. In
its Eastern Military District alone, [Russia boasts a diverse arsenal of
hi-tech land, air and maritime assets, including long-range bombers,
top-of-the-line fighter jets and some of the quietest nuclear submarines
in the world]{.underline}. Much of this firepower is directed as a
strategic deterrent towards the US and its allies. Barring the outbreak
of major hostilities in the East, though, Russia's military assets also
serve to boost Russia's credibility as a regional power, according to
Vasily Kashin, a senior fellow at the National Research University in
Moscow. "A strong military is necessary for an independent foreign
policy," Kashin said. "And an independent foreign policy is associated
with significant economic and political benefits." Chinese military set
for capability boost with delivery of Russian Su-35 fighter jets In both
economic and political terms, Russia would struggle to compete outright
with China and the US. In turn, Moscow had taken a pragmatic approach to
maximise its opportunities, said Natasha Kuhrt, a war studies professor
at King's College London. Whereas Russia often played a zero-sum game in
other regions such as Europe, it broadly avoided talk of alliances in
the East, Kuhrt said. Instead, [Russia has presented itself as an
alternative to countries not keen to line up behind Beijing]{.underline}
or Washington. A THIRD WAY [The pitch]{.underline} has certainly [worked
for the Philippines]{.underline}, especially as Philippine President
Rodrigo Duterte pursues his own independent foreign policy agenda,
according to Fe Apon, a Russia specialist at the Centre for
International Relations and Strategic Studies in Manila. "Duterte really
wants to develop relations with non-traditional partners for immediate,
tangible benefits," Apon said. "Russia is a natural choice in the
military area." The growing ties between Moscow and Manila were evident
in August, when the Philippine Defence Minister Delfin Lorenzana
announced plans for one of his country's warships to visit the city of
Vladivostok, home to the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet. The port call was
billed as friendly reciprocation for recent Russian port calls in
Manila, but it will also mark a historic first for a navy that
traditionally operates closer to home. Philippine Navy band members

American allies in Europe and East Asia, to buy new vessels. Russia is

Russia Carlos Sorreta Apon said it seemed clear that Russia was willing
to supply better military hardware than the US, even after six decades
of close partnership between Washington and Manila. She said a Facebook
post last month by the Philippine ambassador to Russia, Carlos Sorreta,
summed up her government's views. "[Russia is willing to provide brand
new equipment customised to]{.underline} the [specific
needs]{.underline} of the Philippines, at favourable financial terms,
with reasonable delivery times, full aftersales service, necessary
training and [without political conditionalities]{.underline} or
limitations," Sorreta said in the post. While the US often imposes
policy expectations on would-be partners or clients -- such as a
government's attitude to human rights -- Russia has few preconditions
about other countries' domestic affairs. [This was a key selling point
for Indonesia]{.underline}, according to Evan Laksmana, a senior
researcher at the Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International
Studies. Indonesia is a former client state of the Soviet Union, and
Laksmana said the country's legacy familiarity with Russian equipment
contributed to Russia's desirability as a partner. Moscow also offers
flexible financial terms on sales, including "soft loans" that carry
below-market interest rates. US military chiefs reach out to Asian
allies as great power game heats up with China and Russia Indonesia has
placed orders for Russian Su-35 fighter jets, while Moscow has leveraged
its ties with the country to send clear signals to its adversaries of
its expanding reach and influence. TESTING THE WATER In December,
Indonesian officials welcomed two Russian Tu-95MS strategic bombers upon
landing at an airfield on a small Indonesian island north of Papua New
Guinea. The bombers then launched a long-range air patrol from the
airfield, Russia's first from Indonesian soil. Similar patrols from
Russia's domestic bases elicit routine protests from the US and Japan --
and in this case, military bases in northern Australia were put on alert
-- but Russia's muscle-flexing has ruffled few feathers in the region at
large. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (centre) reviews Russian

expenditure cuts have become unavoidable]{.underline}. At the time of
writing budget plans for 2016 were still unclear, but the preliminary
indications from the Ministry of Finance are that military spending will
be pegged or even reduced, [[leading to a reduced GDP share of
expenditure on national defense]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps back to
the 3.5 percent of 2014, compared with a peak of 4.3 percent in 2015. Of

It is practically a cliché in international relations: \"Russia without
Ukraine is a country, Russia with Ukraine is an empire.\"
[Putin]{.underline}\'s Russia [appears to believe that reclaiming
great-power status is the only way it can guarantee
security]{.underline} against a hostile West. Jeffrey Lewis, an arms
control expert, traced this Russian government obsession with Ukraine
back to Putin\'s political weakness at home, as well as Russia\'s sense
of military insecurity against a hostile and overwhelmingly powerful
West. \"I suspect that [[the desire to unite the Russian world
and]{.mark} to **[subjugate]{.mark} the non-Russian
[neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is driven by]{.mark} a fundamental
sense of [insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Lewis said in a
much-circulated September podcast on Putin\'s nuclear threats. \"That[,
like the Soviet leadership, he has to try very hard to stay in power,
and]{.underline} so [there's a tendency as his legitimacy declines to
try to blame outside forces.]{.underline} And the problem is that when
you try to look at the world in that conspiratorial way, [there's always
a justification for subjugating the next set of
neighbors.\"]{.underline} This means that [should the US or other
Western countries become sufficiently involved]{.underline} in Ukraine
[that Russia cannot maintain control of the conflict, then [Russia may
feel]{.mark} this puts it at such **existential threat** that [it has no
choice but to **escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline} in response. **[[Even at
the risk of war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Russia knows it would lose a
full-blown war with NATO,]{.underline} of course, [but]{.underline} it
has other options. An official with the Russian Defense Ministry\'s
public advisory board told the Moscow Times that should Western
countries arm Ukraine\'s military, it would respond by escalating in
Ukraine itself as well as \"asymmetrically against Washington or its
allies on other fronts.\" [[Russian]{.mark} asymmetrical
[acts]{.mark}]{.underline} --- cyberattacks, propaganda operations meant
to create panic, military flights, even little green men --- are all
effective precisely because they [[introduce]{.underline} **[uncertainty
and risk]{.underline}**]{.mark}. If that sounds dangerous, it is.
[[American and NATO red lines]{.mark} for what acts of \"asymmetry\"

**Nuclear war\-\--unique because of failing modernization now**

Joshua **Rovner 15**, the John Goodwin Tower Distinguished Chair in
International Politics and National Security at Southern Methodist
University and Director of the Security and Strategy Program, 8/26/15,
"How Vladimir Putin\'s paranoia could lead to nuclear war,"
<http://theweek.com/articles/572575/how-vladimir-putins-paranoia-could-lead-nuclear-war>

In one sense, the fact that Putin is a bad strategist is good news for
the United States. His [[self-defeating strategies are reducing Russian
power]{.mark} and leaving it isolated]{.underline}. This will make it
easier for Washington to focus on other parts of the world. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [does not need
bold action to shore up its gigantic advantages relative to Russia. It
[only needs to allow Putin to keep on blundering]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It also does not need to engage in a costly arms race, [[given doubts
that Russia can live up to its own]{.mark} military
[modernization]{.mark} [targets]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[But Putin]{.mark}\'s incompetence also creates new risks]{.underline}.
His inability to learn from Ukraine, for instance, suggests that he
might be willing to try the same gambit in the Baltics on the pretext of
defending ethnic Russians. Putin may believe that he can attempt a
similar sort of covert coup using special operators and supporting
separatists while publicly denying any involvement. [He
[might]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[begin overt conventional
maneuvers]{.underline}]{.mark} near the Estonian or Latvian border to
send a tacit threat of Russian intervention. Making good on that threat,
however, would risk a conflict with the United States, which would be
obligated to come to the defense of its NATO allies.

What would happen if NATO sent conventional forces to contest Russian
moves in the Baltics? Some analysts correctly note that while NATO
possesses overwhelming advantages in the aggregate, it would be
outnumbered locally. This means that [[Russia could quickly establish a
foothold on]{.mark} some slice of [Baltic territory]{.mark}]{.underline}
before the United States could organize a response. [[NATO
would]{.underline}]{.mark} need some time to arrive in theater with the
strength needed to confront Russian forces, and it would [[have to fight
very hard]{.underline}]{.mark} to eject them. And [beyond the costs of
conventional fighting, [they would]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[face the
risk of]{.mark} a [nuclear exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
escalation is not inevitable, Putin\'s strategic ineptitude makes it
more likely.

In the abstract, [[there are psychological, political, and military
pathways to nuclear escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, intense
[wartime psychological [stress might cause leaders to misinterpret
signals]{.mark} of restraint]{.underline}, exaggerate the costs and
danger of fighting, [[and become risk-acceptant]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Second, [paranoid [leaders might believe]{.mark} the price of [losing is
regime change]{.mark}]{.underline}. If they are convinced that staying
in power requires decisive victory, even against a vastly superior
conventional enemy, [[they might]{.mark} be willing to [gamble]{.mark}
for resurrection by [crossing the nuclear
threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third, [[leaders may]{.mark} opt to [use
nuclear weapons through]{.mark}]{.underline} a process of [[inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. They may reasonably construe attacks on
their command and control systems, for instance, as part of a campaign
to disable their deterrent force. Under these circumstances they might
act on a terrible \"use it or lose it\" impulse, even if their adversary
had no intention of destroying their nuclear capabilities.

While all three of these scenarios could occur during a NATO--Russia
conventional conflict, [[Putin\'s strategic myopia]{.underline}]{.mark}
is particularly troubling because it [[exacerbates]{.mark} the
psychological and political [pathways to
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The inability to recognize failure
might give him false confidence about Russia\'s prospect against NATO
forces, especially because Russia would enjoy initially superior numbers
in a hypothetical war. This lead might not last long. In the last 30
years the United States has demonstrated extraordinary abilities to
overcome enemy defenses through a combination of rapid maneuver,
electronic warfare, suppression of enemy air defenses, and brute force.
A successful counter-attack against Russian forces, especially including
strikes on Russian air defense installations, would come as a terrifying
shock to Russian leaders. In this case a host of familiar psychological
pathologies could take hold, making it possible for Putin to lash out in
anger and frustration rather than seeking some way of limiting the
damage.

[[Russian expansionist ambitions could]{.mark} quickly [become
"an]{.mark} obvious [existential threat]{.mark} to our whole
being",]{.underline} the most senior British military officer in Nato
has said in a strongly worded speech.

General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, appointed last year as Nato's deputy
commander of forces in Europe, said [[the alliance need]{.mark}ed [to
develop]{.mark} both [fast-reacting conventional forces]{.mark} and
capacities [to counter]{.mark} [Russian efforts at coercion and
propaganda]{.mark}, as seen in Ukraine.]{.underline}

Talking of "an era of constant competition with Russia", Bradshaw told
an audience at the Royal United Services Institute that Nato had to
maintain a cohesive system of deterrence on its eastern borders,
something that would require help from the EU.

He said Nato was pushing ahead with plans for a very high readiness
joint taskforce, ["in order to convince Russia, or any other state
adversary, that **any attack on one Nato member will inevitably lead
them into a conflict with the whole alliance**".]{.underline}

David [[Cameron]{.mark} has [warned]{.mark} Vladimir [Putin of "more
consequences]{.mark}" if a ceasefire in Ukraine does not
hold]{.underline}. Speaking on a visit to Govan shipyard in Glasgow on
Friday, the prime minister said the responsibility for what had happened
in Ukraine "lies absolutely squarely with Vladimir Putin and Russia",
and a strong response was needed.

Cameron said: "In terms of what Britain has done, we were the first
country to say that Russia should be thrown out of the G8, and Russia
was thrown out of the G8. We have been the strongest adherent that we
need strong sanctions in Europe and we've pushed for those, achieved
those and held on to those at every single occasion.

In his speech, [[Bradshaw described Russia's tactics as]{.mark} a
"[hybrid]{.mark} combination", [using fast-generated conventional
military forces as well as "subversion]{.mark} by a number of means,
both [military and non-military".]{.mark}]{.underline}

His strongest words came during a section of the speech introducing
other threats faced by Nato, including that from Islamic State. He said:
"While **[the [threat from Russia, together with]{.mark} the
[risk]{.mark} it brings [of]{.mark} a [miscalc]{.mark}ulation resulting
in a slide [into strategic conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however
unlikely we see that as being right now, **[[represents]{.mark} an
obvious [existential threat]{.mark} to our whole being]{.underline}**,
we of course face threats from Isis and other instabilities to our way
of life and the security of our loved ones."

POLICY IMPLICATIONS [[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} bellicose rhetoric
and [provocative [behavior]{.mark} [have prompted]{.mark} long-overdue
[increases in NATO defense spending]{.mark} and more robust efforts by
the alliance [to bolster]{.mark} its [deterrence and]{.mark} defense
[capabilities]{.mark} on its eastern flank.]{.underline} At its last
summit, NATO heads of state agreed to forward deploy more capable and
credible defenses to the territory of NATO's most vulnerable members.
These are necessary and positive contributions that, by reducing Russian
confidence in a quick victory, lower the odds of a NATO-Russia conflict.
But they are not panaceas. [The [military buildup of]{.mark} both
alliance and [Russian forces]{.mark} in the east]{.underline} reflects
the assumption on both sides that it will produce greater security.
Instead, [the action-reaction dynamic risks generating less, not more,
security on both sides]{.underline}.82 [Whether NATO muscle-flexing will
provoke or deter Russian adventurism is uncertain, given]{.underline}
the scope for misjudging the perceptions and risk-reward calculus of the
Kremlin. Based on Russia's recent behavior in the Baltics---specifically
[Putin's willingness to engage in tit-for-tat responses with NATO forces
over incidents of harassment and provocative military
maneuvers]{.underline}---[[Putin is unlikely to]{.mark} [back down and
change his]{.mark} provocative [behavior in the face of NATO's military
moves]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The alliance therefore needs to further
supplement the military measures taken to deter and defend against
Russian military adventurism]{.underline} with other measures to shore
up NATO's defenses on the eastern flank while reducing the risk of war
with Russia. Steps that merit further consideration include the
following.

#### Russia's military modernization effort increases its threat to NATO.

BRUSSELS --- [NATO military officials are exploring whether to upgrade
their defen]{.underline}ses to make them [capable of shooting down newly
deployed Russian intermediate-range nuclear missiles after a landmark
arms treaty]{.underline} [dissolves]{.underline} [next
month]{.underline}, according to three European officials.

[Any change to the stated mission of [NATO's current missile defense
system]{.mark}]{.underline} --- aimed at threats from outside the
region, like Iran --- would probably [divide the alliance's member
countries and [enrage Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has long said
it views NATO's missile defense site in Romania and one under
construction in Poland as a threat to its nuclear arsenal and a source
of instability in Europe.

"**[[It would be a point of no return with the
Russians]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Jim Townsend, a former Pentagon
official and expert on the alliance. "[It would be a real
[escalation]{.mark}."]{.underline}

The [United States announced in February its intention to withdraw from
the 31-year-old Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]{.underline},
signed in 1987 in the waning years of the Cold War, citing Moscow's
years of violations, a step the NATO alliance supported.

The treaty, which prohibits missiles with a range of 310 to 3,420 miles
from Europe, will be terminated on Aug. 2 unless Moscow and Washington
come to agreement to revive it in the next few weeks.

NATO ambassadors will make one last attempt to push Russia to withdraw
its new cruise missiles and revive the treaty on Friday in Brussels.

Discussions about new missile defense measures are at their earliest
stages, officials cautioned. NATO's chief spokeswoman, Oana Lungescu,
denied that any studies of the feasibility of upgrading the ballistic
missile defenses were underway. She said the alliance had repeatedly
made clear that the existing ballistic missile defense system "is
neither designed nor directed against Russia."

But the [[alliance is considering new air and missile
defenses]{.underline}]{.mark}, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
announced last week without revealing details. And given the rising
threat of the Russian cruise missiles, NATO members are expected to
order the alliance to study defense options, either after the October
defense ministers' meeting or the December leaders' summit, a senior
alliance official said.

The NATO Aegis defense system in Romania in 2016. The systems there and
in Poland are currently incapable of firing the interceptor used to
strike intermediate-range missiles.

[Such an order would require all 29 allies to agree to it]{.underline}.
But some officials think that if the treaty ends, the allies will at
least be willing to examine the options. The [senior official said that
if the allies ultimately could not agree on shifting the mission of the
ballistic missile defense sites, they may be open to a compromise that
would introduce new systems to defend against Russian cruise
missiles]{.underline}.

The [push for improved defenses is fueled by Russia's fielding of a new
class of missiles as well as the expected demise of the
treaty]{.underline} --- a [casualty of deteriorating relations between
Russia and the United States]{.underline}. Eastern [European countries,
particularly Poland and the Baltic states]{.underline}, **[believe they
are under growing threat of nuclear bullying by Moscow]{.underline}**
and have been eager to see the alliance develop new defenses.

Based on intelligence from multiple allied agencies, [NATO countries
have forged a consensus that the new Russian nuclear-capable cruise
missiles pose a threat]{.underline}. The [missiles]{.underline}, some
American and European analysts fear, [could give Moscow significant
leverage]{.underline}, using the threat of attack to force other
countries to de-escalate or give in to Russian demands during a crisis.

The [[relationship between Russia and the West has spiraled downward
since]{.mark} Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea]{.underline}. [Russia's
destabilization of Ukraine forced the alliance to reinforce its eastern
flank with new troop deployments and military exercises]{.underline}.
[[Moscow]{.underline} [responded with its own
military]{.underline}]{.mark} [[upgrades]{.underline}]{.mark},
ultimately including the deployment of a new class of ground-based
cruise missiles that the West said [[violated the I.N.F.
treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia's election interference, its
intervention in Syria and the attempted poisoning of a former Russian
intelligence officer in Britain further heightened tensions.

[[Any move by NATO to redirect]{.mark} its [missile defenses]{.mark} or
expand its system with new capabilities [could be a tipping
point]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russians]{.underline} [have never believed
the alliance's denials that its interceptor system would not eventually
be used to shoot down Russian missiles]{.underline}. The system has
remained a persistent irritant for Moscow, which questioned why the
alliance still needed it after Iran agreed in 2015 to pause its nuclear
enrichment program and threatened to direct missiles at the alliance
interceptor sites.

[The Kremlin]{.underline} has a dramatically different perspective. It
[maintains that it is threatened by the West and by instability not only
around Russia's periphery but also at home]{.underline}. With [[NATO's
expansion]{.mark}, the alliance's border with Russia [has
shifted]{.mark} much [closer to]{.mark} the [Russian heartland. These
fears]{.mark}, however unjustified they seem from the West's point of
view, [have prompted the Kremlin to launch a national mobilization
effort to thwart]{.mark} what it perceives as a direct [Western threat
to Russian security]{.mark}]{.underline}. As seen from the Kremlin, over
the past twenty years[, the United States and [NATO]{.mark} have
undertaken numerous [initiatives]{.mark} that [underscore the threat
from the West]{.mark}: NATO [expansion into Eastern Europe]{.mark} and
the Baltics; NATO [partnership programs with states]{.mark} throughout
the [former Soviet Union]{.mark}; improvements in conventional, missile
defense, and [nuclear capabilities;]{.mark} support for antigovernment
uprisings and regime change around Russia's periphery; [and assistance
to opposition]{.mark} movements and parties [inside
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Specifically, Russian officials have argued
that the U.S.-led campaign in the Balkans in the 1990s, the U.S.-led
invasion of Iraq in 2003, NATO's military intervention in Libya in 2011,
and U.S. support for the opposition in Syria and for the Arab Spring
have threatened Russia's security environment.1

These [[conflicting perceptions have contributed to]{.mark} a [lack of
trust]{.mark}, a [deteriorating security environment, and]{.mark} the
prospect of [a]{.mark} much more unstable and [dangerous adversarial
relationship]{.mark} between the West and Russia for many years to
come]{.underline}. It remains to be seen whether U.S. President Donald
Trump's desire to improve relations with Russia will prove successful in
lowering tensions and putting the U.S-Russian relationship on a more
positive trajectory. There are ample grounds, however, for skepticism.
The U.S.-Russian confrontation is deeply rooted in fundamental
differences over interests and values, clashing conceptions of the rules
of international order, and each country's views of its own
exceptionalism.

### Tac Nucs\-\--A2: Mod Already

#### Russia's nuclear stock has decreased, but modernization would pose a new threat

Weapons?",
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanskristensen/2019/05/07/russian-tactical-nuclear-weapons/#631629c72d79>)

[Washington is buzzing with warnings that Russia is increasing its
number of non-strategic nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The Trump
administration's [Nuclear Posture
Review](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF) (NPR)
is clear and unequivocal: "Russia's non-strategic nuclear weapons
modernization is increasing the total number of such weapons in its
arsenal."

The NPR's threat assessment and embrace of what it calls "the return of
Great Power Competition" are [based on the premise that Russian and
Chinese military capabilities]{.underline} and political [activities
have changed so dramatically]{.underline} in the past ten years that US
defense planning also must change significantly (beyond the changes
already made during the past decade).

At the nuclear level, the [[alleged "increase" of the size of Russia's
non-strategic warhead inventory is front and center]{.underline}]{.mark}
to the claim made by the NPR and defense hawks that Russian nuclear
strategy has become more dangerous. Russia has a new reckless
"escalate-to-deescalate" strategy that is more willing to use low-yield
tactical nuclear weapons first, so the argument goes (although this
characterization has been [rejected by some independent
experts](https://warontherocks.com/2017/09/the-myth-of-russias-lowered-nuclear-threshold/)).

Therefore, the [NPR says]{.underline}, the United States must build new
low-yield nuclear weapons to "help counter any mistaken perception of an
exploitable 'gap' in U.S. regional deterrence capabilities."

In response, the Trump administration has already begun production of a
low-yield nuclear warhead -- the W76-2 - that will arm the Navy's
ballistic missile submarines from next year. And it is [pursuing the
development of a new tactical nuclear sea-launched cruise
missile]{.underline}.

[It seems like a perfect threat-funding-loop sales pitch:]{.underline}
Russia is increasing its non-strategic nuclear weapons that it is more
prepared to use first, so give us more money to build new nukes.

[[But is Russia actually increasing]{.mark} the [number of]{.mark} its
non-strategic nuclear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}? In stark contrast
with the NPR claim, I hear [there's no significant increase in the total
numbers. [On the contrary, there has been a
significant reduction]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past ten years --
the very period the NPR uses as the basis for its threat assessment.

In July 2009, when then-principle deputy undersecretary of defense for
policy Jim Miller briefed NATO on the Nuclear Posture Review the [Obama
administration was preparing at the time, [he told the
allies](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09USNATO378_a.html) that
Russia had an "estimated 3-5 thousand" tactical warheads. Two years
later, [Miller told the US
Congress](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg71527/html/CHRG-112hhrg71527.htm) that
"Unclassified estimates suggest that Russia has...2,000 to
4,000]{.underline}...non-strategic tactical nuclear weapons."

Six years later, in February 2018, the Trump administration's
NPR [reported](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF)that
Russia had "[[an active stockpile of up to 2,000 non-strategic nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}..." That's is close to the estimate [we
have made here at
FAS](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00963402.2019.1580891?needAccess=true) for
the past several years.

But that is [not an increase but a significant reduction]{.underline} of
more than 1,000-3,000 tactical warheads over ten years.

When I have questioned US officials about the NPR claim that Russia is
increasing its non-strategic nuclear weapons, I've been told the number
went up again just before the NPR was completed. That is true, other
officials have later confirmed, but they explain it was only a small
increase in 2016 and that the number has not increased since.
[Fluctuations aside, the increase doesn't come close to making up for
the total reduction over the past decade]{.underline}.

This discrepancy between the significant reduction of Russian tactical
nuclear warheads over the past ten years and the NPR's alarming
portrayal of a dangerous increase is deeply disturbing. Not only does it
apparently mischaracterize what Russia is actually doing ([some
officials](https://www.stratcom.mil/Media/Speeches/Article/1800469/house-armed-services-subcommittee-on-strategic-forces-holds-hearing-on-fiscal-2/) even
seem to try to nudge the number up a bit to "approximately 2,000" or
privately suggesting they have "over 2,000" non-strategic nuclear
warheads), it seems to distort what the US intelligence community knows,
for the apparent purpose of creating political support in Congress to
pay for new nuclear weapons.

That said[, there is no doubt that [[Russia]{.mark} is
[modernizing]{.mark}](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00963402.2019.1580891?needAccess=true)[ its
non-strategic nuclear weapons]{.mark} and introducing new or modified
types]{.underline}; [so is the United
States](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00963402.2019.1606503?needAccess=true).
That is [[important to monitor carefully]{.underline}]{.mark} (nor is
there anything benign about Russia's general military aggression and
meddling in other countries\' elections). But Russia is also retiring
old non-strategic nuclear weapons[; it's in [a transition between old
and new types that creates fluctuations]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
estimate. [And its military [strategy relies more on such weapons to
compensate for Russia's inferior conventional
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that has been the case for the past
two decades -- [as well as to make up for what otherwise would be a
sizeable deficit in the overall balance of Russian and US nuclear
warheads]{.underline} (yes, the United States has more strategic weapons
than Russia).

#### Russia struggling to modernize low-yield nukes -- financial crisis & delays of new systems

Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists
where he monitors and informs about the status of the world's nuclear
weapons arsenals. He's also an Associate Senior Fellow to SIPRI, Robert

<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2018.1462912>)

[Overall, Russia's nuclear [modernization effort will present the
international arms control community with new
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unless a new arms reduction agreement
is reached in the near future, the [shrinking of Russia's strategic
nuclear arsenal that has characterized the past two decades will likely
come to an end]{.underline}, with the force leveling out at around 530
launchers with roughly 2,500 assigned warheads. [[But Russia's financial
crisis represents a significant challenge]{.mark} to maintaining even
that force level, as [exemplified by the delays of]{.mark} several
[major weapon systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, like the small ICBM (SS-28)
and the rail-based ICBM.

In his speech to Russia's parliament on March 1st, [President Vladimir
[Putin highlighted]{.mark} several [new nuclear weapon
systems]{.mark}]{.underline} that were intended to demonstrate to the
world -- and in particular the United States -- that nuclear forces are
indispensable for Russia's security and status as a great power. [The
modernization is motivated in part by Moscow's strong desire to maintain
overall parity with the United States]{.underline}, but also by the
Russian leadership's apparent conviction that the US ballistic missile
defense system constitutes a real future risk to the credibility of
Russia's retaliatory capability. Policy and strategy aside, [the
development of multiple weapon systems also [indicates the strong
influence of the military industrial complex on Russia's nuclear]{.mark}
posture [planning]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The international debate about Russia's nuclear strategy reached a new
level of intensity in 2017, and even more so after the Trump
administration published its Nuclear Posture Review in February 2018.
The Nuclear Posture Review claims that "Russian strategy and doctrine
emphasize the potential coercive and military uses of nuclear weapons.
It mistakenly assesses that the threat of nuclear escalation or actual
first use of nuclear weapons would serve to 'de-escalate' a conflict on
terms favorable to Russia" (US Defense Department 2018, 8).
Specifically, the document claims, "[[Moscow threatens and exercises
limited nuclear first use]{.mark}, suggesting a mistaken expectation
that coercive nuclear threats or limited first use could paralyze the
United States and NATO and thereby end a conflict on terms favorable to
Russia." This so-called "[escalate to deescalate" doctrine]{.mark}
"follows from Moscow's mistaken assumption of Western capitulation on
terms favorable to Moscow]{.underline}" (US Defense Department 2018, 30)

Such characterizations conflict with Russia's publicly stated policy.
Like the United States, Russia has at least since 2000 reserved the
right to potentially use nuclear weapons in response to large-scale
conventional aggression. Its current military strategy, published in
December 2014, says that Russia "shall reserve for itself the right to
employ nuclear weapons in response to the use against it and/or its
allies of nuclear and other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, as
well as in the case of aggression against the Russian Federation with
use of conventional weapons when the state's very existence has been
threatened" (Russian Federation 2014). This formulation is almost
identical to the previous version from 2010 (Russian Federation 2010).
Because the wording implies Russia would only use nuclear weapons in
retaliation against an existential threat, independent analysts have
challenged the Nuclear Posture Review's characterization of the Russian
strategy as overblown and a misreading of what is really happening.

Whatever the correct interpretation of Russia's nuclear strategy is,
Moscow seems to be administering that strategy more dynamically and
offensively than it did a decade ago. Russian officials have made many
statements about nuclear weapons that appear to go beyond the published
doctrine, threatening to potentially use them in situations that do not
meet the conditions described. For example, officials explicitly
threatened to use nuclear weapons against ballistic missile defense
facilities, and in regional scenarios that do not threaten Russia's
survival or involve attacks with weapons of mass destruction.

Moreover, [the fact that [Russian military]{.mark} planners are
[pursuing]{.mark} a broad range of e[xisting and new versions of nuclear
weapons suggests that the]{.mark} real [doctrine goes]{.mark} beyond
basic deterrence and [towards regional warfighting
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[or even]{.mark} weapons aimed at
[bluntly causing terror.]{.mark}]{.underline} One widely-cited example
[involves [the so-called Status-6, a nuclear-powered
torpedo]{.mark}]{.underline} with very long range that a [Russian
government document [blatantly described as intended to create "areas of
wide radioactive contamination t]{.mark}hat would be unsuitable for
military, economic, or other activity for long periods of
time"]{.underline} (Podvig 2015). Such indiscriminate damage would
appear to violate the proportionality and distinction principles of the
laws of war. A diagram and description of the proposed weapon, first
revealed in a Russian television broadcast, can still be seen on YouTube
(YouTube 2015). The US Nuclear Posture Review confirmed that [the
Russian torpedo was [under development]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Putin

#### Sustained arms sales key -- successful exports most important thing for military modernization

1992 saw the start of a very important [[reduction in the defence
industry's]{.mark} level of military [output]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
was [[due to the fall]{.mark} not only [in]{.mark} domestic armaments
demand but also in the [volume of exports]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[reduction]{.underline} in both types of demand has given exports a
strategic value in the maintenance of economic activity in part of the
defence industry. Those [[organisations that have managed to export have
become the industry's most dynamic focal points]{.mark},]{.underline}
due to the fact that such [production has meant that the effects of the
decline in output have been softened]{.underline}. After nearly ten
years, the [Russian [defence industry's]{.mark} production capacity [is
in very bad health]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} the [situation in]{.mark} those
[companies most closely connected to exporting is
better]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is the reason why such companies form
an essential part of the nucleus of the future defence industry and what
they produce (type of weapons built) is the basis of future production,
even that used to meet domestic needs. [Therefore, [weapons exports
represent an]{.mark} economic [restriction that will condition]{.mark}
the make-up of the [future military priorities]{.mark}]{.underline} and
the restructuring of the defence industry.

[As a consequence]{.underline} of the change in how exports and the
defence industry are organised, two time periods can be distinguished on
the basis of the policy put into practice. During the first, 1992--97,
the policy in place was one conditioned by the Soviet inheritance and
characterised by the distributing of foreign orders among several of the
companies able to meet them. As a result, exports did not become a
mechanism for slowing down the fall in output suffered by the defence
companies. From 1997 onwards, in spite of the fact that there has been
no explicitly stated export policy, a certain regularity in the
behaviour of the Russian authorities (export policy carried out in
practice) has been revealed simply by observing the facts. To be
specific, the tendency arose to concentrate export orders in only one of
the possible producing companies. This policy is a very controversial
one and, therefore, has been put into practice de facto but not de iure,
which is to say there has been no explicit statement.

The motivation for the export policy is a evidently a combination of
political decisions and economics factors. When multiple producers of a
similar type of weapon exist, one of the producers is selected; however,
[in cases when external demand has been concentrated on a type of
weapon, this economic factor conditions the political
decision.]{.underline} In cases where there are both product
differentiation and a certain external demand, the political decision is
postponed, as shown in Table 2 (political priority column).

[Therefore, the companies in which [export orders]{.mark} are being
concentrated [will go on to constitute]{.mark} one of [the most
important pillars of the]{.mark} future [Russian defence
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore[, their [products
will]{.mark} [be the basis on which]{.mark} [domestic needs are
covered]{.mark} and some of the most important Russian arms development
programmes]{.underline} are estab- lished. The policy of weapons exports
has thus been used as an economic tool to restructure the defence
industry and, in the future, it seems that it will play a much more
dynamic role in this regard.

#### Arms Exports key to re-orient the Russian defense industry away from government subsidies and towards external markets -- leads to effective reformation and modernization

out that [[state companies]{.mark}, receiving government subsidies [are
less efficient than private ones]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among the main
problems is the ineffective allocation of resources (Sherstobitova O.V.,
2013; Kildeeva I.N., 2015), which is the main reason for a lack of
motivation towards choosing the optimal trajectory of economic activity
by the state enterprises. Low efficiency of state companies is admitted
on the level of Russian Federation ministries, including the Ministry of
Finance (Minfin..., 2017).

3.2. [[Reformation]{.mark} an[d]{.mark} modernization [of the]{.mark}
national military-industrial complex [Russian military-industrial
complex requires modernization]{.mark}, which will [allow companies to
optimize their economic activity and lower their costs]{.mark}, which
will lead to greater and more stable]{.underline} financial
[results.]{.underline} The total revenue of 15 largest enterprises of
Russian MIC amounted to 952 bln. rubles, while their total profits are
53.3 bln. rubles, while 3 companies out of 15 ended the year with a net
loss, which evidences the [companies' low efficiency of their available
resources]{.underline}. Apart from purchasing new equipment, which
lowers costs, [stimulating the research and utilization of innovatory
technologies, the MIC [requires]{.mark}]{.underline} a state policy,
aimed at [the [development of market mechanisms]{.mark} in this sphere.
As a part of this reform, [the industry must re-orient itself towards
the external markets]{.mark}, while the research of modern trends in
military sphere and formation of these tendencies nationally [will lead
to an increase in competitiveness by Russian
enterprises]{.mark}]{.underline} on the international markets.

### Tac Nucs\-\--Yes Impact

#### Modernization of nuclear arsenals makes them more usable -- clean weapons, advanced precision capabilities, arms races, and minor Russian advancements already playing a role in deterrence dynamics

**Thomas-Noone 16** (Brendan Thomas-Noone, Research Fellow, Foreign
Policy and Defence Program, United States Studies Centre, September 30,
2016, Accessed: July 23, 2019, Lowy Institute, "Tactical nuclear weapons
in the modern nuclear era",
<https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era>)

What impact the proliferation of credible "reconnaissance-strike
complexes" will have on strategic stability has not been thoroughly
considered. [During the Cold War,]{.underline} [the line between nuclear
and conventional weapon use was "relatively bright and unambiguous",
owing mainly to the indiscriminate nature of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.[\[19\]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era#_edn19) Nuclear
weapons helped to provide strategic stability because generally they
could not be used without causing catastrophic and indiscriminate
destruction. However[, [as technology has advanced]{.mark} in terms of
missile capability, ISR, and warhead design, [discriminate use of
nuclear weapons may become a credible]{.mark} military [option]{.mark}.
[Advanced precision capabilities,]{.mark} in combination with [low-yield
warheads]{.mark}, could, for example, potentially [allow states to use
tactical nuclear weapons]{.mark} in an attempt to dissuade a
conventionally superior opponent from escalating their
attacks]{.underline}.[\[20\]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era#_edn20) Improving
precision warfare capability may also tempt defence planners to
contemplate the use of low-yield nuclear warheads for particularly
difficult targets that are buried underground and protected by advanced
area-denial capabilities. [Other types of warheads, such as so-called
"[clean]{.mark}" nuclear [weapons]{.mark} (fusion reactions that result
in minimal radiation fallout) are also [challenging the]{.mark}
traditional [distinction between conventional and nuclear
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}.[\[21\]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era#_edn21)

The [evolution of tech]{.underline}nology is [also [raising the prospect
of decapitation strikes]{.mark} in a crisis or conflict
situation]{.underline}. Decapitation strikes, where the political and
military leadership and command and control facilities of a nuclear
power are eliminated before they are able to order a retaliatory attack,
were a significant element of Soviet anxiety during the Cold
War.[\[22\]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era#_edn22) The
advent of [increasingly [credible precision strike
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}, [cruise missile capabilities, global
strike delivery platforms, [and hypersonic weapons have]{.mark} all
[made]{.mark} such [strikes more
feasible]{.mark}]{.underline}.[\[23\]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era#_edn23) Indeed,
there are some indications that [[Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} improved
[submarine-borne nuclear-capable [cruise missile capability may
already]{.mark} [be playing a role in]{.mark} nuclear [deterrence
dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline} between Moscow and the
Washington.[\[24\]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era#_edn24)

Additionally, a lesson that emerged from the Cold War period is that the
[[competing nuclear modernisation programs]{.mark} of the United States
and the Soviet Union were "interactive]{.underline}", in that both sides
feared "being placed at a disadvantage in crises or a breakdown of
deterrence".[\[25\]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era#_edn25) For
strategic stability, this [can [lead to a cycle of improvement and
investment]{.mark} in nuclear arsenals [that can become more
"diversified and filled out" and]{.mark} can turn force structures into
ones seemingly ["suited for war-fighting rather than
deterrence]{.mark}"]{.underline}. During the Cold War, this became more
obvious through an "increasing emphasis on flexibility, 'nuclear
options'" and other similar
dictums.[\[26\]](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/tactical-nuclear-weapons-modern-nuclear-era#_edn26) [The
increasing technological capability of all three major nuclear powers to
launch sophisticated tactical nuclear weapon strikes may also provide
incentives for similar arms race dynamics]{.underline}.

## Impact\-\--Russian Revisionism

### Revisionism\-\--1NC

#### Russia will pursue [revisionist expansionism]{.underline} as long as it has the [economic capacity]{.underline} to do so \-\-- [leads to war]{.underline}

**Payne** and Foster **17** -- \*Keith, PhD in IR @ USC, Professor of
Defense and Strategic Studies @ Mo State, \*\*John, PhD, Director of
Defense Research and Engineering, Department of Defense; Director of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ("Russian strategy Expansion,
crisis and conflict," *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)

[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic political [[system]{.mark}
under Putin [is]{.mark} [oriented to expansionist policies]{.mark} and
is predicated on recasting Russia as a de facto empire. The inherent
revisionism of Russian policy and its fundamental anti-liberalism makes
anti-Americanism the default option of Russian policy]{.underline}.
Cooperation, where possible is tactical and instrumental, not a result
of a strategic rapprochement. This applies to arms control accords where
Moscow feels free to break inconvenient agreements. [[Russia's]{.mark}
overall [security policies begin]{.mark} with the [presupposition of
conflict]{.mark} with most of its interlocutors and [thus entails a
consistent bias toward the militarization]{.mark} of its domestic and
foreign policies]{.underline}. Domestic dissent is equated to treason by
fifth columnists linked to external enemies and virtually all elements
of domestic policy are viewed through this prism.71 [Given these
continuing and strongly rooted factors, [Russia's conventional and
nuclear buildup will continue]{.mark} **as long as Russia can afford
it**]{.underline} and Putin retains power, even if he must ratchet back
the level or scope of this buildup as a result of economic pressures.
[The dangerous threat environment]{.underline} for the West described
above [will not change unless there are dramatic changes]{.underline} in
Russia's expansionist goals and Russia's willingness to use any and all
forms of pressure to advance them, i.e., Russia's grand strategy. Absent
such a change in Russia's strategic goals, U.S. and NATO conciliatory
behavior/actions are likely to present an image of disunity and
indecision, and thereby potentially provoke further Russian
belligerence. [[The]{.mark} usual [Western hope that arms control will
address threats]{.mark} and relieve it of the need to respond more
forcefully appears particularly fanciful now. Putin is little interested
in new arms control and is manifestly willing to violate existing
agreements]{.underline}. As will be discussed in Chapters Two and Five,
Russia has systematically violated the Helsinki Final Act, all the
treaties with Ukraine and other CIS governments on the inviolability of
borders, and the 1994 Budapest Accord with Washington, London and Kiev
on Ukraine's denuclearization; it also has broken the INF treaty, the
CFE treaty (Conventional Forces in Europe) and its political promises in
the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives. Unfortunately, [[abundant evidence
points]{.mark} to the continuing mobilization [of Russia for a long-term
state of siege with the West, if not actual wa]{.mark}r]{.underline}, as
Moscow continues to insist that it is secure only if all its
interlocutors are not. A mobilization policy initiated by 2009 has
greatly accelerated since 2013. If Russia cannot escape from the Putin
regime's anti-Western hostility and insistence upon hegemony, [the
ensuing state of siege will be a source of crises and conflict for
years]{.underline}. [Perhaps most dangerous is the fact that Putin is
not a magician who can control the nationalism and militarism he has
inflamed]{.underline}. As the then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey said in July 2014, "If I have a fear about
this it's that [[Putin may actually light]{.mark} a fire that he loses
control [of]{.mark}]{.underline}."72 Indeed, [**[crises and
conflict]{.mark}** are the **logical [consequences]{.mark} of Putin's
[expansionist grand strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Russian expansionism leads to nuclear use

**Payne** and Foster **17** -- \*Keith, PhD in IR @ USC, Professor of
Defense and Strategic Studies @ Mo State, \*\*John, PhD, Director of
Defense Research and Engineering, Department of Defense; Director of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ("Russian strategy Expansion,
crisis and conflict," *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)

Russian nuclear and conventional force programs and Russia grand
strategy [[Russia]{.mark} clearly attributes]{.underline} political and
military [[value to]{.underline}]{.mark} its nuclear arsenal, and the
threat of limited [[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} [first use]{.underline}
more specifically, as a means to support its efforts to reassert its
dominance over the post-Soviet space. Moscow's strategy is intended to
intimidate neighbors and deter outside interference in Russian
activities through the threat of nuclear first use.
[Russia's]{.underline} apparently [low nuclear [threshold raises the
stakes in any conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, and compels adversaries to
confront the possibility that should they become involved, so too would
Russian nuclear weapons. This has been prominently displayed throughout
hostilities in Ukraine, as Russian nuclear exercises, official
statements, and bomber patrols are intended to intimidate Western
states. First and foremost, Russia's strategy couples multidimensional
operations with overt nuclear threats for the purpose of precluding
retaliation by the aggrieved party and/or its allies---thus giving
Russia a free hand to pursue its expansionist goals. Moscow seeks this
seemingly ultimate trump card within its "near abroad." This use of
nuclear weapons is not a replay of Cold War notions of mutual nuclear
deterrence. It is a strategy of nuclear coercion to support expansionist
goals. As noted in Chapter Three, Deputy Commander of NATO Forces in
Europe General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, concluded in this regard that
Russia's "threat of escalation might be used to prevent reestablishment
of territorial integrity."125 Acclaimed Russian analyst Pavel
Felgenhauer agreed, suggesting [[Moscow is becoming comfortable]{.mark}
with [using the threat of]{.mark} [nuclear war]{.mark} to]{.underline}
"[scare the West]{.underline} into concessions."126 This continued
approach could lead to an "emboldened Russia brandishing nuclear weapons
each time it wants something."127 Despite describing its policy as
purely defensive, it is clear that Russia considers nuclear coercion as
a great power instrument to be leveraged during periods of hostilities
to protect a potential fait accompli. If, as seems to be the case,
Moscow views this as a viable strategy, Russia may continue to act more
aggressively toward post-Soviet states, potentially including the
eastern portion of NATO, backed up by nuclear threats. At the very
least, if the Kremlin feels threatened, it will display its nuclear
sabre to escalate the conflict to a nuclear level others would simply be
unwilling to match. During a meeting at the Valdai Club in October 2014,
Putin himself gave a history lesson on the power of nuclear
intimidation, stating: True, the Soviet Union was referred to as "the
Upper Volta with missiles." Maybe so, and there were loads of missiles.
Besides, we had such brilliant politicians like Nikita Khrushchev, who
hammered the desk with his shoe at the UN. And the whole world,
primarily the United States, and NATO thought: this Nikita is best left
alone, he might just go and fire a missile, they have lots of them, we
should better show some respect for them.128 [The danger in this Russian
view is obvious: [nuclear
brinks]{.mark}]{.underline}[man[ship]{.underline} [could trigger a chain
of events that leads to a nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} confrontation or
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.129 [Should a confident and "bold" Putin
severely miscalculate]{.underline} a NATO response, [he could believe
nuclear escalation of a conflict to be a viable option]{.underline}. In
addition, if a conflict erupts, Russia's flexible and discriminate
nuclear systems may afford Moscow the ability to frustrate NATO
war-planning. By employing specific, specialized systems against
high-value target sets, such as aircraft carriers, critical command and
control nodes, and long-range air bases, Russia could effectively carry
out an offset strategy using both non-nuclear and nuclear means to
negate NATO's conventional superiority by destroying the alliance's most
prized assets. This could cause enormous losses for NATO military
personal and infrastructure, and constrain NATO's ability to conduct
offensive operations to dislodge an occupying Russian force. As is
intended, Moscow's threat to use nuclear weapons could result in
coercive pressure to prevent certain conventional NATO actions during
the course of a conflict as well---essentially a form of intra-war
nuclear coercion.130 This could consist of nuclear threats to prevent
NATO from targeting supply hubs, air bases, or sophisticated air and
missile defenses located just inside Russia's borders, which could be
critical targets during an operation to remove Russian forces. By
threatening nuclear escalation, Moscow could force NATO to choose
between limiting its response or nuclear war. Thus, NATO must prepare
for not just a miscalculated Russian nuclear strike, but a calculated
one as well. Finally, should deterrence fail and a crisis escalate,
Russian leaders could believe that limited nuclear use would localize
and terminate a conflict on advantageous terms, as is suggested by its
nuclear escalation strategy. Moscow appears to believe that it can
control escalation by restraining the types of nuclear weapons used,
their targets, and under what circumstances each weapon is used, while
threatening the possibility of further nuclear escalation, up to global
nuclear war. Essentially, by credibly threatening to break the long
revered nuclear taboo, Russia appears to anticipate being able to coerce
NATO into submission or acquiescence to Russian domination of the
post-Soviet space. In short, Russian nuclear strategy envisions the
threat of and possible employment of nuclear weapons to achieve military
and political objectives. As Sergei Ivanov once told the state Duma, "As
regard to use of nuclear weapons in case of aggression, of course \[we
will use them in this case\]. What else were they built for?131 The
Times of London reported in April 2015 that retired Russian generals,
who had been briefed by Ivanov and approved by Putin, met with a group
of retired U.S. generals and warned that if NATO builds up its forces in
the Baltics, Russia would respond by increasing its "nuclear posture"
and that, "Russia will use its nuclear weapons against NATO."132
However, the core of Russia's nuclear strategy does not appear to
anticipate a general nuclear war with NATO. The Kremlin appears to
believe that NATO's greatest strength is also its most exploitable
weakness: dependence on unanimity among its 28 members.133 Following the
great Chinese strategist Sun Tzu's teaching on the value of disrupting
an enemy's alliances, Russian limited nuclear use threats appear
intended to divide NATO by threatening greater destruction and loss
should the bloc fail to yield during a conflict. The Russian leadership
appears to assume that French, British, American, and German leaders
will be divided in their willingness to risk nuclear retaliation over
distant regions such as Warsaw, Narva, or Daugavpils. As U.S. Amb.
Robert Joseph has noted, "Russia's doctrine assumes an asymmetry of
interests and a lack of willingness on the part of the enemy to risk
nuclear war (emphasis added)."134 A fundamental component of Russia's
nuclear strategy is to challenge NATO's resolve. Indeed, the Russian
leadership has seemingly come to see limited nuclear threats as a viable
policy option specifically fashioned to challenge NATO, based on the
presumption that most NATO members ultimately will be unwilling to
defend their Eastern-most allies in the face of Russian nuclear
escalation threats.135 Conclusion The Russian leadership undoubtedly
views nuclear weapons as an essential coercive instrument to accomplish
both political and military objectives related to securing Moscow's
goals. By developing a spectrum of nuclear threats and capabilities, and
a strategy to employ nuclear weapons, Russia clearly backstops its
expansionist campaigns. Whether it be covering hybrid operations,
intimidating European states, or potentially employing nuclear strikes
to defeat a conventionally superior adversary, [[nuclear]{.underline}
[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} [and the threat of their [use are
likely]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} remain, if not
[[grow]{.underline}, [in importance for Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
short, Russia's nuclear strategy is in line with the Putin regime's
worldview and grand strategy discussed in Chapter One, the goal of which
is to establish a new Eurasian security order based on Russian hegemony
at the expense of NATO, and more importantly, the United States. More
disturbingly, [the Kremlin appears to believe that actual nuclear
employment is a realistic option in support of expansion. Should Putin
determine a major confrontation probable, he could conclude that
launching a limited nuclear strike would be an advantageous option.
Given Putin's]{.underline} apparent [propensity]{.underline} [for
risk-taking and [his]{.mark} absolute [desire to reestablish a greater
Russia]{.mark}, he [could find himself in a situation where he greatly
miscalculates]{.mark}]{.underline} either his own forces' abilities or
NATO's willingness to capitulate. If Russia's nuclear exercises are an
indication, [the threat of Russian [nuclear first use is
**real**]{.mark} in a]{.underline} European [contingency that is itself
the result of **Russian expansionism and aggression**]{.underline}.

Reminiscent of the Soviet era, [military [arms exports]{.mark} have once

offsetting the damages caused by Western sanctions]{.underline}.
[[Russia's]{.mark} involvement in the Syrian War on behalf of Bashar

utilized its military exports to enhance its image as a world power,

Middle East. In addition to sending advanced weaponry to Syria, Russia
showcased its military hardware against Western made weapons, sending a
clear signal of Russian reliability and sophistication to nations
wanting to upgrade, purchase or diversify their military inventory. [The

fundamental instrument of national power and [supports the achievement

what it considers its sphere of influence, with **[Putin's goal to

at Russia's defense export sales]{.underline}**. The inextricable link
between foreign military sales and the achievement of Russia's national

surprise.

### Revisionism\-\--A2: Russia Peaceful

#### Overwhelming evidence proves Russia is expansionist and revisionist \-\-- prefer our ev \-\-- theirs is benign optimism and ignores a clear historical record

**Payne 17** -- PhD in IR @ USC, Professor of Defense and Strategic
Studies @ Mo State (Keith, "Russian strategy Expansion, crisis and
conflict," *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)

This monograph, Russian Strategy: Expansion, Crisis and Conflict, is
based on readily-available and open sources of information, particularly
including numerous Russian publications. [[Russian foreign military
actions]{.mark}, defense initiatives, markedly [expanded conventional
and nuclear arms programs]{.mark}, internal repression, and egregious
arms control non-compliance [appear to be elements of]{.mark} an
increasingly assertive and [threatening agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
this text, we call out and examine the apparent grand strategy
underlying Russian policies, programs and behavior. This examination
demonstrates that [[Russian]{.mark} grand [strategy]{.mark} now includes
a deeply-troubling mix of ingredients: [increasing hostility toward the
West]{.mark}, including expressed military threats]{.underline} via
statements and nuclear exercises directed against the United States and
NATO countries; [[expanding programs to produce]{.mark} advanced
[weapons]{.mark} and delivery vehicles, conventional and nuclear;
[revisions in military doctrine]{.mark} that place greater emphasis on
the employment of nuclear weapons, including first use; [military
campaigns against neighboring states]{.mark}; [the first annexation of
European territory]{.mark}]{.underline} by military force [since World
War II; increasing military-oriented incursions in U.S., Canadian,
European and Japanese air space; arms control noncompliance; and
increasing domestic repression and authoritarianism]{.underline}. The
December 2014 edition of Russia's military doctrine identified the
United States and NATO as the top threat to Russia.1 The President of
Estonia, Toomas Ilves, described the current situation in Europe:
"Everything that has happened since 1989 has been predicated on the
fundamental assumption that you don't change borders by force, and
that's now out the window."2 [Russian hostility and expansionist goals
have been manifest at least since Russia's 2008 military action against
Georgia]{.underline}, which reportedly was backed by an alert of Russian
nuclear forces.3 More recent Russian military actions include the
annexation of Crimea, the support of pro-Russian rebels in Eastern
Ukraine with elements of the Russian army, and unprecedented military
operations in Syria. [[These]{.mark} developments [have created the
potential for escalating]{.mark}]{.underline} political-military
[[crises]{.underline}]{.mark} in Europe [and]{.underline} [may be more
dangerous than were Soviet Cold War policies and behavior]{.underline}.
In particular, as is explained herein, contemporary [[Russian nuclear
strategy is intended to coerce the West]{.mark} and [enforce Moscow's
expansionist moves with nuclear first-use threats]{.mark} and planning
that go well beyond Soviet Cold War behavior]{.underline}. [Until these
most recent developments, the West generally has not considered Russia
to be a security threat]{.underline} and there has been very little
focus on Russia [for two decades. U.S. attention has been elsewhere and
the desire to see Russia as only a past threat has been
overwhelming]{.underline}. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney was
roundly ridiculed when he suggested in 2012 that Russia remained a
priority security threat to the West, and in the same year a former Vice
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff asserted confidently that the risk
of a nuclear confrontation with Russia "belongs to the past, not the
future."4 And, when Russia occupied Crimea in 2014, the United States
was in the process of reducing U.S. military forces in Europe. [Russia
continues to receive limited attention]{.underline}. Indeed, [many still
dismiss the potential for an [escalating crisis with
Russia]{.mark},]{.underline}5 [and the systematic, integrated character
of pertinent Russian policies remains largely
unrecognized]{.underline}.6 [This]{.underline} monograph [does not
re-create Cold War images of Russia; it seeks instead to identify and
understand emerging realities and the various threads of contemporary
Russian policy and behavior in the unique context of Russian grand
strategy]{.underline}. [Such a comprehensive understanding of Russian
policy and behavior will be necessary if the West is to formulate an
effective counterstrategy and minimize the potential for crises and
conflicts]{.underline} that otherwise appear inevitable. Herein are
hundreds of references and statements by senior Russian officials.
Perhaps the most indicative of Russia's strategic direction is by former
Russian Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov, "great powers ...do not dissolve
in international unions--- they create them around themselves." It has

#### Revisionism is the best explanation for Russian behavior

China and Russia are pushing a reluctant West to re-examine its most
cherished assumptions about the shape of the global order.[Three decades
after the end of the Cold War, the parameters of the next round of
global state-on-state security competition are now in full
view]{.underline}. Long after history was declared to be at an end and
America's "unipolar moment" was so lyrically heralded, the world today
looks nothing like such post-Cold War projections. The rules-based
liberal global order has proved to be a chimera while the fundamentals
of economic power as the foundation of military strength have once again
been reaffirmed. Despite decades spent cajoling people to believe that
they owe a higher allegiance to institutions transcending the
nation-state, all too many remain stubbornly unconvinced. [This new era
of great power competition will likely remain with us for the rest of
our lives; rapid escalation and, ultimately, war are no longer merely a
theoretical possibility]{.underline}. This is not to say that the
changes wrought during the preceding decades were all for naught.
Although the core principles of great power competition are as true
today as they have always been, over the past three post-Cold War
decades the distribution of power has shifted significantly across the
globe, and in some regions quite dramatically. The world has become more
complex both in terms of technology and social cleavages, but also more
rudimentary: For America and the West more broadly, questions of
national power, national sovereignty, and ultimately national survival
are now more urgent than they have been since 1945.For America and the
West more broadly, questions of national power, national sovereignty,
and ultimately national survival are now more urgent than they have been
since 1945. The lesson here is not that timing is everything, but rather
that [[strategic vision]{.underline}]{.mark}---along with the capacity
to expect the unexpected---[[is what matters]{.mark} most when nations
approach systemic inflection points such as those we are at
today]{.underline}. The United States and Europe come to this current
round of great power competition burdened by several serious handicaps.
[[The confrontation between the United States and]{.underline}]{.mark}
its competitors China and [[Russia is increasingly
global]{.underline}]{.mark}, posing a dilemma akin to that of a
two-front war. Even if one does not fall prey to the exaggerations of
China's wealth and technological progress commonly afflicting accounts
of that country's rise, it is nevertheless clear that [the United States
needs to]{.underline} move beyond the "status quo power"
handicap---namely, the reluctance to take risks by [pushi]{.underline}ng
[back against revisionist states, and the attendant desire to seek
accommodation]{.underline}. For almost half a century, analysts have
labored under the delusion that China can be brought into the liberal
international system through economic development, in the process
morphing into an approximation of a Western democracy. The belief that
economic access will somehow "domesticate" the Chinese communist regime
has always been lacking in empirical foundation. Indeed, the examples
invoked by many in political science, such as the political evolution of
South Korea and Taiwan, have been misapplied; in both cases the
strategic imperative of remaining close to the United States shaped
their domestic politics. The fundamental change in our view of China as
a power hostile to the United States, intent on replacing America in the
international order, should be the underlying assumption of any debate
about U.S. global strategy going forward. This means that in the near
term we must make every effort to "onshore" the critical elements of our
supply chain that we have so ill-advisedly farmed out to Asia. We need
to recall the Cold War lesson that technological superiority rests not
only in design but, more importantly, in processes, alloys, composites,
and so on---namely, in our technological culture writ large. During the
Cold War the Soviets could steal Western designs for weapons systems,
but they had to rely on their own technological culture to produce their
versions. In contrast, we have transferred the crown jewels of American
technological know-how to China, the devastating consequences of which
become clear when we compare the parameters of our systems with theirs,
and measure the shift in the balance of power. "If you are in a hole,
stop digging," goes the old American adage. This applies in spades to
our decades-long trade policy, which has allowed China to enter the WTO,
to claim "developing country" status, and to continue to extort American
corporations for their most treasured economic secrets in exchange for
market access. Enough already. Putin's Russia presents a different
challenge to U.S. global supremacy. [[Russia is a **revisionist power**
intent on creating a sphere of privileged interest]{.mark} along its
periphery, including in Europe, but it lacks the resources to mount a
frontal challenge to the United States]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, Vladimir [[Putin has repeatedly demonstrated
his]{.mark} [thorough understanding of full-spectrum
statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the application of military
force to achieve clearly defined political objectives. [[Putin's]{.mark}
ability to selectively [invest his country's limited
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether [[in new military
hardware]{.mark} or in campaigns such as in Syria and Ukraine, has
yielded outsized results]{.underline}. The key to Russia's successful
challenge to the rules-based order in Europe has been Putin's ability to
anticipate the deeply ingrained risk aversion of key powers in Europe.
Hence, despite having kicked over the table on which the leading states
in the European Union sought to set the future of the European order,
Putin still continues to dangle before them visions of a "grand deal"
that would address Russia's "legitimate security concerns." His gamble
in Ukraine, meanwhile, has polarized the European Union, and especially
has widened the rift over differing threat perceptions between countries
like Germany and France, on the one hand, and the former Soviet
satellites and the Scandinavians on the northeastern flank on the other.
The growing discord within the European Union and NATO has yielded a
debate over what, during the Cold War, would have been considered a
mortal threat to the unity of the West, as seen in today's rather loose
talk about the need for European "strategic autonomy"---as though some
of NATO's most vital European allies were now tracking toward an
emancipatory policy that could ultimately leave the United States
outside. In short, [the challenge to the United States posed by
Russia]{.underline}, notwithstanding the country's relatively weak
economic position [when compared to China's, is much more]{.underline}
intricate and [insidious]{.underline}, for [[it threatens to undermine
and dismantle the foundations of the Transatlantic security
system]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The United States is at an inflection
point,]{.underline} one in which [our choices going forward will have a
transformative impact on our security and that of our
allies]{.underline}. This is a "late 1940s moment"---one that requires a
massive adjustment in how we view and interact with other key players in
the international system and what priorities we set going forward. Today
Washington appears to have finally awakened to the reality that
long-cherished assumptions about what the world would look like after
the Cold War were fundamentally flawed. It is almost uncanny that this
most profound redefinition of U.S. foreign and security policy has been
produced during the Donald J. Trump presidency---at a time when American
politics have become polarized to a point few thought possible only a
decade ago. And yet, through its National Security Strategy and its
National Defense Strategy, the Trump Administration has produced
arguably the first coherent articulation since the fall of the Berlin
Wall of the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be, free of
pious shibboleths and expressing a determination to redress past
mistakes. [What needs to happen now is]{.underline} the translation of
these key strategic documents into guidance that will shape the
[restoration of our military capabilities and those of our
allies]{.underline}. This is our "late 1940s moment," a latter-day
version of the reorientation that yielded our present defense
infrastructure and ultimately led to the creation of NATO. The West
needs to pull together yet again. The clock is ticking.

#### Even if they aren't revisionist, that's only because of a lack of economic resources \-\-- plan changes that calculus

Russia\'s Approach to the Global Order: Revisionist or Not?,"

Yet [[Russia does not]{.mark} and cannot steer global rules because it
does not [have the **econ**]{.mark}**omic
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "[It is important to go beyond a
simple and misleading dichotomy between]{.underline} dominant and
emerging or between [revisionist and status-quo powers because [Russia
fits none of these categories]{.mark}. We need to think about Russia as
a restoring or **recovering power**]{.underline}," he said. Discussions
of the global liberal order often fail to acknowledge that the Soviet
Union also contributed to the establishment of that order after World
War II, he pointed out. The USSR helped found the United Nations and led
in the creation of other institutions and norms (today's
non-proliferation regime and international pacts on human rights, for
example) fundamental to the current international order. Russian
official discourse still emphasizes the importance of international
institutions. The central role for the UN and international law has been
acknowledged in every Foreign Policy Concept adopted in Russia since
2000. To explain Russia's adherence to existing international
institutions such as the UN, Istomin claimed that with the rise of new
powers -- such as China, India, and even the EU, which have their own
agendas regarding the shape of international institutions -- [[Russia
has less ability to affect international norms]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially when compared to the position the USSR enjoyed in a bipolar
world. The United States, of course, faces a similar challenge because
it also must consider the interests of rising powers. Thus, new
institutions will be less reflective of Russian and American interests
-- giving the once-dominate superpowers a reason to cooperate. Istomin
conceded that the [existing discourse on Russia as a revisionist power
is not completely out of touch with reality]{.underline}. "There are
institutions in the international system which Russia does not feel
comfortable with," he said, citing NATO as an example. [Now that Russia
has recovered from the crises of the 1990s, it has pushed back
against]{.underline} those [institutions]{.underline} in which Russia's
voice was not heard. Another reason Russia tries to shape new rules and
institutions in the international system is strategic. "[Russia
understands that the rising powers will continue to rise, and it thus
tries to accommodate the interests of other rising powers in order to
secure a better bargaining position until they get
stronger,]{.underline}" Istomin said. The BRICS -- a forum of countries
with very diverse agendas -- exemplify Moscow's accommodation. "Russia
embraced the idea proposed by the rising powers about the reform of
international financial institutions despite it not being Russia's
priority."

### Revisionism\-\--A2: Russia Peaceful\-\--Response to US

#### Russian motives are [independent]{.underline} of US aggression

Dictators, Demagogues, and the Coming Dark Age @ Yale Press (James, "The
Roots of Russian Aggression,"

**[Don't blame the West]{.underline}**

The Cold War didn't "end" --- it was won.

--- George H. W. Bush, 1992

As U.S.--Russian relations reach a post--Cold War low, a growing number
of observers have concluded that Western behavior, not Russian
belligerence, ultimately lies at fault. According to this analysis, the
United States and its European allies "humiliated" Russia by enlarging
NATO, undertaking military action in the Balkans, extending trade and
other forms of soft power to the former Eastern Bloc, and generally not
affording Moscow the respect it supposedly deserved as a great (albeit
territorially smaller and militarily weaker than it once was) power.
"The West will find it easier to coexist with this tormented,
intransigent, melancholy and oil-rich neighbor when Russia feels
comfortable with itself, not when its nose is rubbed in its long history
of failure," the British military historian Max Hastings wrote in 2008
after Russia invaded Georgia. Two years later, well into Barack Obama's
"reset" aimed at repairing relations with Moscow, former U.S. ambassador
to the Soviet Union Jack Matlock blamed American hubris for the rise in
tensions. "The collapse of the Soviet Union was seen as a military
victory, which led to a spirit of triumphalism and a feeling of
omnipotence as the 'sole superpower,'" he said. Repeating the word
"triumphalist," which has become ubiquitous in these types of
appraisals, Matlock complained that "a lot of this triumphalist
mythology has come from the neocons whose ideas were rejected by Reagan,
who in the end was more interested in negotiating." So stubbornly is
this historical narrative of Western arrogance and Russian innocence
asserted that it has become impervious to all manner of Russian
mischief, no matter how morally egregious or physically destructive. In
2014, after Russian president Vladimir Putin annexed the Crimean
peninsula in the first armed seizure of territory on the European
continent since World War II, former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev
denounced NATO "triumphalism" as the culprit, though the military
alliance had expressly chosen not to offer Ukraine a pathway to
membership at its 2008 Bucharest summit. So, too, last year did Odd Arne
Westad, a Harvard professor and the author of a mammoth new history of
the Cold War, accuse America of "post--Cold War triumphalism" that
"promoted a prosperity agenda of market values on a global scale." He
lamented that, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia was
not welcomed into the Western fold. Instead, "ideas and assumptions that
had built up over generations persisted, despite the disappearance of
the Soviet threat." According to these critics of Western
"triumphalism," Washington and its allies repeatedly neglected to take
post-Soviet Russia's legitimate security concerns into account, thereby
making the present impasse all but inevitable. "After the end of the
Cold War, the Euro-Atlantic countries failed to create a regional
security system that would include Russia," Dmitri Trenin wrote in
February. Trenin, a former Soviet army colonel who now works at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is essentially arguing that
NATO, originally established to resist Moscow, ought to have extended
membership to it. The most recent and prominent airing of this view
appeared in mid May in the pages of The New York Times Magazine, where
Russian-American author Keith Gessen profiled two camps of Washington
"Russia hands." On one side, he wrote, are the hawkish
"internationalists" who impudently act as if the West prevailed in some
long twilight struggle against Soviet Communism. On the other are sober
"realists" who "believe that the intransigent and unchanging one in the
relationship is the United States --- that the country has never gotten
past the idea that it 'won' the Cold War and therefore needs to spread,
at all costs, the American way of life." These critics of Western
"triumphalism" are right that the root of our current problems with
Russia can be traced back to the 1990s. But they have drawn the wrong
lessons from that crucial period. [[No proper understanding of
contemporary]{.mark} [U.S.--Russian relations can escape]{.mark} the
fact that the West won --- and the Soviet Union lost --- [the Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}. By "win," one does not mean only that the free
world achieved its geopolitical objectives, liberating Eastern Europe
and orchestrating the downfall of a superpower rival. For the Cold War
was more than a mere struggle over territory and global influence. It
was also a moral struggle between two fundamentally different systems.
And it wasn't just liberal-democratic market capitalism that prevailed
over totalitarian command-economy socialism. What also won was a version
of state sovereignty whereby small nations have as much right to
determine their destiny as large ones do, free from external domination.
With the fall of the Berlin Wall, there triumphed a particular vision of
ordering not just a society but the world. Long before the collapse of
their empire, Soviet leaders endorsed this conception of state
sovereignty by signing the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, which committed
signatories to respect one another's "sovereign equality," the
"inviolability of frontiers," the "territorial integrity of states,"
"non-intervention in internal affairs," and the "peaceful settlement of
disputes." Collectively, these resolutions constituted the act's "first
basket" of agreements. The second basket incorporated trade and
scientific cooperation, while the third committed states to uphold human
rights, freedom of emigration, and freedom of the press. At the time,
the Soviets were eager for such an agreement because it essentially
legitimized their post-war domination of Central and Eastern Europe,
where they had installed Communist puppet regimes (which, along with the
United States and its Western allies, were also party to the Helsinki
accords). While the Eastern Bloc governments had no intention of
actually upholding the act's "third basket," their formal recognition of
it came back to haunt them in the form of dissidents who cited these
written commitments in making their case for great political freedom.
So, too, were the Soviets and their allies taken by surprise when
national independence movements referenced the act's sovereignty
provisions to expose the fundamental illegitimacy of the Warsaw Pact,
all along a façade for Russian colonialism. That the Soviets (and,
later, Russians) never intended to take the human-rights and sovereignty
provisions of the Final Act seriously is a repudiation not of the Final
Act itself but of the leaders who disingenuously signed it. Soviet
leaders again endorsed the principle of national sovereignty when, in
1989, they supplanted the Brezhnev Doctrine, which permitted Warsaw Pact
countries to intervene militarily against "forces hostile to socialism"
in other member nations, with the "Sinatra Doctrine," whereby Eastern
Bloc states could do it their way. Though it was not Gorbachev's
intention, this momentous decision ultimately led to the peaceful
dissolution of the Soviet Union. The first post--Cold War conflict to
erupt between Russia and the West was in the Balkans, where the United
States and its allies intervened militarily to avert ethnic cleansing
carried out by Moscow's traditional ally, the Serbs. Confronting
internal economic and political instability, and prosecuting a
scorched-earth war in Chechnya, Russia was in no position to challenge
NATO in the former Yugoslavia. This inability to contest Western
intervention in what Moscow considered its imperial backyard bred
feelings of resentment among a rising generation of Russian
nationalists, who would later choose to fixate on the Western military
alliance as the greatest threat to Russian security. [The]{.underline}
subject of NATO's post--Cold War enlargement, and more specifically the
[[false claim that Western leaders promised]{.mark} their Soviet
counterparts [that NATO would refrain]{.mark} from incorporating new
members, [has won credibility of late]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Particularly after the Ukraine crisis, Russia's Western sycophants,
seeking to justify Putin's aggression, trotted out the claim that NATO's
"encircling" of Russia had somehow forced Putin into invading his
neighbors]{.underline}. **[It is remarkable how pervasive this narrative
has become]{.underline}**. Touring the United States over the past year
to promote my book about Europe, I have never addressed an audience in
which someone did not mention, if not endorse, this argument. Assertions
of Western "triumphalism" with regard to NATO enlargement gained
strength in December when an outfit called the National Security Archive
at George Washington University selectively published a series of
recently declassified U.S.-government documents purporting to show, once
and for all, that Western leaders had indeed offered their Soviet
interlocutors a "cascade of assurances" that NATO would not expand.
Despite its official-sounding name, the National Security Archive is a
left-wing organization committed to exposing the Cold War sins, real or
alleged, of America through the highly selective publishing of
tendentiously presented documents, and nothing in the latest dump tells
us anything new. As is already known, James Baker, then the secretary of
state, promised Gorbachev that NATO would not expand "one inch
eastward." The archive attempts to embellish this statement by releasing
some extraneous once-classified documents. But Baker made that pledge
solely in the context of East Germany, a country that, like the Soviet
Union, would soon cease to exist. At the time, it was inconceivable that
places such as Poland or Czechoslovakia (another state not long for this
world), never mind the soon-to-be independent Soviet Baltic republics of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, might one day join NATO. Russia and its
Western apologists can offer no evidence of a promise not to enlarge
NATO, because such a promise was never made. Gorbachev should have the
final word on this matter: "The topic of 'NATO expansion' was not
discussed at all, and it wasn't brought up in those years," he said in
October 2014. "I say this with full responsibility. Not a single Eastern
European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased
to exist in 1991." Only years later would the prospect of former Warsaw
Pact states' joining NATO become a subject of more than academic
discussion, when the alliance offered membership to Hungary, Poland, and
the Czech Republic. In 1997, all three joined. But relitigating what
assurances the West did or did not make to the collapsing Soviet Union
about NATO's future status is a distraction from the more fundamental
question: What right does Russia have to decide whether its former
satrapies can join a defensive military alliance of their own free will?
In the words of the former State Department official Kirk Bennet, "NATO
enlargement was driven by demand, not supply." The newly independent
countries of Central and Eastern Europe all desperately wanted to join
NATO, and given their histories with Russia, it's not hard to understand
why. The practice of invading European neighbors because they stray from
the true socialist path --- employed by the Russians in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia in 1956 and 1968, respectively --- is a model of
interstate behavior that was supposed to have been forever discredited
with the collapse of the Soviet Union. (As events in Georgia in 2008 and
Ukraine six years later demonstrate, however, it has unfortunately been
revived.) The principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity
initially laid out in the Helsinki Final Act were later enshrined in the
1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, agreed to by the Soviet Union
and, following its dissolution, its legal successor state, the Russian
Federation. In 1994, Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum with Ukraine,
Great Britain, and the United States, which saw Kiev surrender its ample
nuclear-weapons stockpile to Moscow in exchange for guarantees of its
territorial integrity. As with practically every understanding it signed
in the post--Cold War period, Russia later violated this pledge.
Throughout the 1990s and well into the reign of Vladimir Putin, the
United States and its allies went out of their way to draw Russia closer
and assuage any fears its government might have had, genuine or
contrived, that the Western alliance harbored aggressive designs. In
1997, the NATO--Russia Founding Act was signed to guide relations
between the West and Russia; among other provisions, the accord limits
the number of troops each side may permanently station in Central and
Eastern Europe. Five years later, the NATO--Russia Council was
established to serve as a forum for "consultation, consensus-building,
cooperation, joint decision and joint action, in which the individual
NATO member states and Russia work as equal partners on a wide spectrum
of security issues of common interest." During the early years of the
war in Afghanistan, Russia and NATO collaborated constructively, with
the former permitting the latter use of its airspace and territory to
transfer supplies to the theater. As late as 2010, the problem that
Russia's then-ambassador to NATO had with the military alliance was not
that it was too belligerent but that it emanated a "mood of
capitulation" with respect to Afghanistan. Further signs of Western
cooperation included granting Russia a place at the table of the G-7
(which thereby became the G-8, until Moscow's annexation of Crimea led
to the suspension of its membership) and admission into the World Trade
Organization. [What provoked the deterioration in relations between
Russia and the West, then, was neither NATO enlargement, nor American
foreign policy, nor anything else that the West did, but **Russian
revanchism and revisionism**]{.underline}. [In 2007, Putin delivered an
anti-American tirade]{.underline} at the Munich Security Conference,
shocking attendees. [Shortly thereafter, Russia launched a cyberattack
on tiny Estonia, and the following year it invaded Georgia]{.underline}.
The French writer Michel Gurfunkiel identifies Putin's four major
strategic goals as reuniting "all the Russian-speaking peoples under a
single nation-state," reestablishing Russia as "the first among equals"
in the "Eurasian community," weakening Europe and the transatlantic
alliance, and restoring Russia as a global power. All of these
objectives are in direct conflict with the understandings achieved by
Western victory in the Cold War and agreed to by Putin's predecessors in
the Kremlin, foremost among them that the consensual model of interstate
relations had replaced the coercive methods of the past. [[Putin's
rhetorical embrace of "Eurasianism]{.mark}," an ideology with fascistic
and mystical undertones, and his establishment of the "Eurasian Union"
as a direct competitor to the European Union, [signaled the decisive
shift away from coop]{.mark}eration [with the West]{.mark} to a strategy
of weakening it from within]{.underline}. [Unlike post-war Germany,
which made full amends for its past militarism and atrocities and
committed itself to multilateralism and nonviolent approaches to
resolving international conflict, Russia never went through a
process]{.underline} of Vergangenheitsbewältigung, or "[coming to
terms]{.underline} with the past." Perhaps this was an unavoidable
consequence of the Cold War's peaceful end --- the Soviet Union, unlike
the Third Reich, was not subjected to a traumatic military defeat and
occupation by its adversaries. But [the [consequences of Russia's not
engaging in the sort of critical appraisal of its own history so
admirably pursued by post-Holocaust Germany are visible]{.mark} all
around us]{.underline} in the modern-day cult of Josef Stalin, the veil
of silence surrounding Communist-era crimes, and the popular support
among the Russian people for Putin's military adventures abroad.
Following the advice of the "realists" Gessen so admires and allowing
Moscow a veto over the foreign-policy orientation of former subjects
would have indulged Russia's notion that it is still an empire and
invited more aggression. By this light, NATO's denial of Membership
Action Plans for Ukraine and Georgia indicates how the West failed to
reap the benefits of winning the Cold War. Chief among these benefits
ought to have been the welcome rise of sovereign countries' Western
aspirations. Instead, the West preferred to assuage Russian inferiority
complexes and hurt feelings. Deprived of the argument that it was
nonexistent NATO expansion to Ukraine that "provoked" Russia to invade
it, some realists cite the EU's 2013 offer of a trade-and-aid package to
Kiev as having justified the aggression. What this excuse neglects to
acknowledge is Putin's 2004 statement "If Ukraine wants to join the EU
and is welcome there, we can only welcome that." Ten years later, he
waged war against the country for trying to do precisely what he had
encouraged. 2 [Our [present-day problems with Russia stem from]{.mark}
two utterly [different]{.mark}, and fundamentally irreconcilable,
[understandings of]{.mark} what the end of [the Cold War]{.mark}
meant.]{.underline} It wasn't just a side that lost but a whole
understanding of how the world should work. From the assassination of
Archduke Ferdinand to the Sudeten crisis to the division of Germany,
most of the 20th century's major conflicts erupted over border disputes
in Central and Eastern Europe. Vladimir Putin's refusal to acknowledge
that small countries have the same rights as larger ones has pitted a
rules-abiding West against a rules-flouting Russia. Faced with neighbors
wishing to break free of their post-imperial yoke, Russians have not
paused to consider that maybe it's their behavior, past and present,
that has led the former "captive nations" to be wary of Moscow's
designs. Rather, [[Russians have internalized]{.mark}, in the words of
former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer, the attitude that
"[nobody likes us, what's wrong with everybody]{.mark}?" For Western
policymakers to endorse such myopia is like **giving car keys to a
drunk**]{.underline}. As Russian troops marched into Crimea under the
same pretext as German forces did into the Sudetenland --- claiming to
"protect" the rights and lives of allegedly threatened ethnic comrades
--- German chancellor Angela Merkel was said to have remarked that
[[Putin lives in]{.mark} "another world."]{.underline} He does. [It's [a
dangerous world where might makes right]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
one that successive generations of Western statesmen, along with
courageous Poles, Czechs, Romanians, and countless others, fought to
overcome. [The [post--Cold War "ideas and assumptions" of
America]{.mark}]{.underline} and its allies [[were]{.mark} not
"triumphalist]{.underline}" diktats [meant to humiliate or "encircle"
Russia]{.underline} by "rubbing its nose" in defeat, but fundamental
principles of sovereignty and national self-determination established to
avert war on a continent repeatedly plagued by it. [[Far from

"At times, **[I'm very concerned about that]{.underline}**," he said.

The general did not elaborate other than to confirm that Russian
maritime activity in the Black Sea showcased the largest grouping of
Russian ships that has been seen in 15 years.

In terms of equipment, he echoed previous comments that combined
long-range fires and air and missile defense systems in the region are
"fundamental" to security in Europe.

Though last year [[large-scale Russian military training exercises
in]{.mark} and near [the Baltic region alarmed leaders]{.mark} and
allies, at the time Scaparrotti told Congress he was more concerned
about Russian meddling in the Balkans.]{.underline}

[[That has not changed]{.underline}.]{.mark}

"[I am concerned about the Balkans," he said. "And the increased malign
influence over the past year]{.underline}."

In fact, the general said, Russian disinformation campaigns and support
to fringe, anti-government and anti-NATO factions within some Balkan
nations had "stepped up" over the past six to eight months.

The [[Russian government tried similar tactics to]{.mark} dissuade or
[prevent Montenegro from joining NATO]{.mark} and failed. They are
[attempting the same]{.mark} push [in]{.mark} [North
Macedonia]{.mark},]{.underline} which may soon join NATO.

[He noted that Balkan stability is somewhat of a veneer that is always
under threat. And [Russian meddling can cause "people to lose
hope"]{.mark}]{.underline} and see the desire to join NATO diminished.

### Revisionism\-\--A2: No War

#### Once a [minor conflict]{.underline} starts, it escalates \-\-- neither side has de-escalation measures in place, and both leaders are conflict-prone

[[Putin's favored tactic]{.underline}]{.mark}, intelligence officials
say, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} known as "[escalation
dominance]{.underline}." [The idea is [to]{.mark}]{.underline} push the
other side until you win, a senior officer based in Europe
explained---to "[[escalate to the point where the adversary
stops]{.underline}]{.mark}, won't go farther. [It's a very destabilizing
strategy]{.underline}." Stavridis cast it in the terms of an old Russian
proverb: "Probe with a bayonet; when you hit steel withdraw, when you
hit mush, proceed." Right now, he added, "the Russians keep pushing out
and hitting mush." This mindset is basically the opposite of how both
American and Soviet leaders approached each other during the Cold War,
even during periods of exceptional stress such as the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis. Having endured the devastation of World War II, they understood
the horror that lurked on the far side of a crisis. "When things started
to get too close, they would back off," said Miller, the retired
Pentagon official. The term of art for this constant recalibration of
risk is "crisis management"---the "most demanding form of diplomacy,"
writes Sir Lawrence Freedman, an emeritus professor of war studies at
King's College London. Leaders had to make delicate judgments about when
to push their opponent and when to create face-saving off-ramps. Perhaps
most critically, they had to possess the confidence to de-escalate when
necessary. Skilled crisis management, Freedman writes, requires "an
ability to match deeds with words, to convey threats without appearing
reckless, and to offer concessions without appearing soft, often while
under intense media scrutiny and facing severe time pressures." A recent
textbook example came in January 2016, when Iran seized those 10 U.S.
Navy sailors, claiming that they had been spying in Iranian waters in
the eastern Persian Gulf. President Barack Obama's secretary of state,
John Kerry, immediately opened communications with his counterpart in
Tehran, using channels established for negotiating the nuclear deal with
Iran. By the next morning, the sailors had been released. The U.S.
acknowledged the sailors had strayed into Iranian waters but did not
apologize, asserting that the transgression had been an innocent error.
Iran, meanwhile, acknowledged that the sailors had not been spying. (The
peaceful resolution was not applauded by Breitbart News, headed at the
time by Stephen Bannon, who is now Trump's chief White House strategist.
Obama, a Breitbart writer sneered, has been "castrated on the world
stage by Iran.") [[Neither Putin nor Trump]{.mark}, it's safe to say,
[are crisis managers]{.mark} by nature. [Both are]{.mark} [notoriously
thin-skinned,]{.mark} operate on instinct, [and]{.mark} have a tendency
to [shun expert advice]{.mark}]{.underline}. (These days, [Putin is said
to surround himself not with seasoned diplomats but cronies from his old
spy days]{.underline}.) [Both are unafraid of brazenly lying, fueling an
atmosphere of extreme distrust on both sides]{.underline}. [Stavridis,
who has studied both [Putin]{.mark} and Trump]{.underline} and who met
with Trump in December, [concluded that the two leaders "[are]{.mark}
not risk-averse. They are risk-affectionate]{.underline}." Aron, the
Russia expert, said, "I think [there is a]{.underline} much more
[cavalier attitude by Putin toward war in general and the threat of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. He continued, "He is not a madman, but [he
is much more [inclined to use the threat of nuclear weapons
in]{.mark}]{.underline} conventional \[[[military]{.underline}\] [and
political confrontation with the West]{.underline}]{.mark}." Perhaps the
most significant difference between the two is that Putin is far more
calculating than Trump. In direct negotiations, he is said to rely on
videotaped analysis of the facial expressions of foreign leaders that
signal when the person is bluffing, confused or lying. [At times, [Trump
has been surprisingly quick to lash out at a perceived slight from
Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, although these moments have been
overshadowed by his effusive praise for the Russian leader. On December
22, Putin promised to strengthen Russia's strategic nuclear forces in
his traditional year-end speech to his officer corps. Hours later, Trump
vowed, via Twitter, to "greatly strengthen and expand" the U.S. nuclear
weapons arsenal. On Morning Joe the following day, host Mika Brzezinski
said that Trump had told her on a phone call, "Let it be an arms race.
We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all." And in late
March, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was becoming
increasingly frustrated with Russia, throwing up his hands in
exasperation when informed that Russia may have violated an arms treaty.
[Some]{.underline} in national security circles see Trump's
impulsiveness as a cause for concern but not for panic. "He can always
overreact," [said]{.underline} Anthony Cordesman, senior strategic
analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a
veteran of many national security posts throughout the U.S. government.
"\[But\] [there are a lot of [people \[around the president\] to prevent
an overreaction]{.mark}]{.underline} with serious consequences." Let's
say that Trump acted upon his impulse to tell a fighter pilot to shoot a
jet that barrel-rolled an American plane. Such a response would still
have to be carried out by the Pentagon, Cordesman said---a process with
lots of room for senior officers to say, "Look, boss, this is a great
idea but can we talk about the repercussions?" And **[yet that process
[is no longer as robust as it once was]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
[Many senior policymaking positions at the Pentagon and State Department
remain unfilled]{.underline}. A small cabal in the White House,
including Bannon, Jared Kushner and a few others, has asserted a role in
foreign policy decisions outside the normal NSC process. It's not yet
clear how much influence is wielded by Trump's widely respected national
security adviser, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. [When lines of
authority and influence are so murky, it increases the risk that a minor
incident could boil up into an unintended clash]{.underline}, said
retired Marine Corps General John Allen, who has served in senior
military and diplomatic posts. [To complicate matters further, the
relentless pace of information in the social media age has destroyed the
one precious factor that helped former leaders safely navigate perilous
situations: time]{.underline}. It's hard to believe now, but during the
1962 Cuban missile crisis, for instance, President Kennedy and his
advisers deliberated for a full 10 weeks before announcing a naval
quarantine of the island. In 1969, a U.S. spy plane was shot down by
North Korean jets over the Sea of Japan, killing all 31 Americans on
board. It took 26 hours for the Pentagon and State Department to
recommend courses of action to President Richard Nixon, according to a
declassified secret assessment. (Nixon eventually decided not to
respond.) Today, thanks to real-time video and data streaming, the men
in the Kremlin and White House can know---or think they know---as much
as the guy in the cockpit of a plane or on the bridge of a warship. The
president no longer needs to rely on reports from military leaders that
have been filtered through their expertise and deeper knowledge of the
situation on the ground. Instead, he can watch a crisis unfold on a
screen and react in real time. [Once news of an incident hits the
internet, the pressure to respond becomes even harder to
withstand]{.underline}. "[The ability to recover from early missteps is
greatly reduced,]{.underline}" Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has written. "[The [speed of war
has changed, and]{.mark} the nature of these changes [makes]{.mark} the
[global security]{.mark} environment even [more unpredictable,]{.mark}
dangerous, and unforgiving]{.underline}." And so in the end, [no matter
how cool and unflappable the instincts of military men and
women]{.underline} like Kevin Webster, [what will smother the inevitable
spark is steady, [thoughtful leadership]{.mark} from within the White
House and the Kremlin]{.underline}. [A recognition that first reports
may be wrong; a willingness to absorb new [and]{.mark} perhaps unwelcome
information; [a thick skin to ward off insults]{.mark} and
accusations]{.underline}; an acknowledgment of the limited value of
threats and bluffs; and [a willingness to recognize the core interests
of the other side]{.underline} and a willingness to accept a face-saving
solution. **[These qualities [are not]{.mark} notably [on display in
either capital]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### No checks on conflict escalation, and Trump is prone to overreact

With these issues in mind, I traveled to Germany this winter to talk
with U.S. Air Force General Tod D. Wolters, who commands American and
NATO air operations. We sat in his headquarters at Ramstein Air Base, a
gleaming, modern complex where officers in the uniforms of various NATO
nations bustle efficiently through polished corridors. "[The degree of
hair-triggeredness is a concern]{.underline}," said Wolters, a former
fighter pilot who encountered Soviet bloc pilots during the Cold War.
"The possibility of an intercept gone wrong," he added, is "on my mind
24/7/365." Admiral James G. Stavridis, the commander of NATO from 2009
to 2013 and now Dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, is more
blunt. [The [potential for miscalc]{.mark}ulation
"[is]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[higher than]{.mark} at [any]{.mark}
other [point since]{.mark} the end of [the Cold
War,]{.mark}"]{.underline} he told me. "**[We are now at maximum
danger]{.underline}**." [This may sound counter-intuitive,
given]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's extravagant professions of
admiration for Putin]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} the strong
consensus inside the U.S. military establishment is that [the pattern of
Russian provocation will continue]{.underline}---and not just because
the various investigations into the Trump campaign's links with Russia
make détente politically unlikely. [Antagonizing the West is central to
one of Putin's most cherished ambitions]{.underline}: undermining NATO.
By constantly pushing the limits with risky intercepts and other
tactics, Putin forces NATO to make difficult choices about when and how
to respond that can sow dissension among its members. In addition, a
certain belligerence towards the U.S. is practically a political
necessity for Putin. The Russian leader owes his popularity to "the
tiger of patriotic mobilization," said Leon Aron, the director of
Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Given the
country's diminished status in the world and its stalled economy, he
added, militarized fervor for the motherland "is the only thing going
for his regime." Meanwhile,\[2\] 2. According to an analysis by the U.S.
Army War College, "[the top [leadership is moving the country onto a war
footing]{.mark}]{.underline}" in response to what it sees as "an arc of
crisis around Russia and a period of great turbulence in international
affairs." since the departure of Trump's first national security
adviser, Michael Flynn, his foreign policy team is now dominated by
officials who advocate a hard line on Russia.\[3\] 3. These include
ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, national security adviser
H.R. McMaster, and senior National Security Council Russia adviser Fiona
Hill. Secretary of Defense James Mattis predicted at his confirmation
hearing that "there are an increasing number of areas where we are going
to have to confront Russia." For all these reasons, Philip [Breedlove,
who retired last summer after three years as supreme allied commander of
NATO, isn't optimistic that Russia will back off]{.underline} anytime
soon. "We're in a bad place and it's getting worse rather than better,"
he told me. "[The probability of coming up against that unintended but
strategic mess-up is, I think, rising rather than becoming less
likely.]{.underline}" When Breedlove's successor, General Curtis
Scaparrotti, took command in May 2016, he grimly warned a gathering of
diplomats and officers of a "resurgent Russia" and cautioned that NATO
must be ready "to fight tonight if deterrence fails." [All of this is
happening at a time when most of the old Cold War safeguards for
resolving tensions with Russia---treaties, gentlemen's understandings,
unofficial back channels---have fallen away]{.underline}. When a Russian
jet barrel-rolls a U.S. aircraft, a senior U.S. official hops in a car
and is driven to the white marble monolith on Wisconsin Avenue that
houses the Russian embassy. There, he sits down with Sergey Kislyak, the
ambassador who has recently attained minor fame for his surreptitious
meetings with various Trump associates. A typical conversation, the U.S.
official told me, goes something like this: "I say, 'Look here, Sergey,
we had this incident on April 11, this is getting out of hand, this is
dangerous.'" Kislyak, the official said, benignly denies that any
misbehavior has occurred. (When I made my own trip to the embassy late
last year, a senior official assured me with a polite smile that Russian
pilots do nothing dangerous---and certainly not barrel-rolls.) [Among
the many senior officers I spoke to in Washington and Europe who are
worried about Russia, there was one more factor fueling their anxiety:
their new commander-in-chief, and how he might react in a
crisis]{.underline}. [[After a Russian fighter barrel-rolled]{.mark} an
RC-135 [over the Baltic Sea]{.mark} last April, [Trump]{.mark} fumed
that the Obama administration had only lodged a diplomatic
protest]{.underline}. [He [considered this to be a weak
response.]{.mark}]{.underline} "It just shows how low we've gone, where
they can toy with us like that," he complained on a radio talk show. "It
shows a lack of respect." [If he were president, [Trump went on]{.mark},
he would do things differently]{.underline}. "You wanna at least make a
phone call or two," he conceded. "\[But\] [[at]{.mark} [a certain
point]{.mark}]{.underline}, when that sucker comes by you, you gotta
shoot. [[You gotta shoot]{.underline}.]{.mark} I mean, you gotta shoot."

### Revisionism\-\--A2: No Nuclear Escalation

#### Russia will [over-rely]{.underline} on nuclear threats in response to conventional crises \-\-- risks nuclear war

Defense and Strategic Studies @ Mo State, \*\*John, PhD, Director of
Defense Research and Engineering, Department of Defense; Director of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ("Russian strategy Expansion,
crisis and conflict," *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)

The year 2014 was a major turning point in post-Cold War history when
Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and engaged in an expanded war in
Eastern Ukraine with the objective of extending Russian control and
possibly creating a land bridge to Crimea. As noted previously,
President Toomas Ilves of Estonia has pointed out, "Everything that has
happened since 1989 has been predicated on the fundamental assumption
that you don't change borders by force, and that's now out the
window."62 It was also a turning point in the Russian use of nuclear
threats. In 2014 and 2015, Russia injected nuclear weapons into the
Ukraine crisis, threatening a nuclear response in the event of a NATO
counter attack. As Deputy Secretary of Defense Work has observed, "
...senior Russian officials continue to make irresponsible statements
regarding Russia's nuclear forces, and we assess that they are doing it
to intimidate our allies and us."63 In his August 2014 Yalta speech on
Ukraine, Putin referenced Russia's large and growing nuclear
capabilities, and warned that NATO should not "mess" with Russia.64 In
September 2014, then-Ukrainian Defense Minister Colonel General Valeriy
Heletey said that Russia threatened on several occasions across
unofficial channels to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine.65
In a March 2015 "documentary" marking the one year anniversary of the
Russian annexation of Crimea, Putin said he was willing to put Russian
nuclear forces on alert during the invasion.66 As Colonel (ret.)
Vladimir Yevseyev, Director of the Center for Social and Political
Research wrote, "Putin is saying that under certain conditions, Russia
will be ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Crimea."67
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} reportedly [[has made nuclear
threats]{.underline}]{.mark} through unofficial channels [[over]{.mark}
[Crimea and the Baltic republics.]{.mark}]{.underline} According to the
London Times, Russian generals present at a meeting in Germany who said
they were speaking for the Russian government indicated that "any
military move by the West on Crimea would trigger a Russian response,
possibly involving nuclear force. 'The United States should also
understand it would also be at risk,"' the generals reportedly said, and
the paper noted that "President Putin is using the threat of a nuclear
showdown over the Baltic states to force NATO to back away from Russia's
border."68 [The fundamental difference in these statements and past
Russian nuclear threats is that [Russia is now talking about the first
use of nuclear weapons **in support of**]{.mark} **Russian aggression
and [expansion]{.mark}**, not only in response]{.underline} to an attack
on Russia. **[[This is an important shift]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As
Lieutenant General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, Deputy NATO military commander,
has noted, Eastern European NATO states face the risk of a Russian
conventional attack backed by the threat of nuclear "escalation" which
would be used to prevent "reestablishment of territorial integrity."69
[Such overt [manifestations of hostility support]{.mark} the [foreign
policy goals of restoring Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} position as a
military force to be reckoned with, expanding Russian
[[dominance]{.underline}]{.mark} in Europe, and creating opportunities
for dissension within the NATO alliance. Nuclear bomber patrols In 2007,
Putin announced the start of bomber "patrols," stating, "Combat alert
has begun today. Twenty strategic missile carriers are taking part in
it. The planes that have scrambled will be in the air for 20 hours with
refueling and in interaction with the Navy."70 These patrols continue to
this day and Russian nuclearcapable bombers are deliberately being flown
into the air defense identification zones of the U.S., Canada, NATO
Europe, and Japan. The intent of these flights is clearly to
intimidate.71 In July 2015, Sputnik News, a Russian state-run news
agency, stated the Tu-95 heavy bomber "is capable of striking the United
States with nuclear bombs," and the purpose of the flights was to
"survey the skies around Russian borders reminding everyone that Russia
is a power to be reckoned with."72 In May 2015, NATO Secretary General
Stoltenberg declared, "Russia has also significantly increased the
scale, number and range of provocative flights by nuclear-capable
bombers across much of the globe. From Japan to Gibraltar. From Crete to
California. And from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea."73 He revealed
that NATO had to intercept Russian military aircraft 400 times in 2014,
twice the number that took place in 2013.74 Sweden has reported
"'unprecedented' Cold War-era levels of activity by Russian military
bombers and fighter aircraft over the Baltic Sea area."75 UK Defense
Minister Michael Fallon said Russia was playing a "provocative and
dangerous" game that could result in the destruction of an airliner over
the UK.76 Russia has even said it will send nuclear-capable bombers to
patrol the Gulf of Mexico.77 These flights have become a serious threat
to air navigation safety because the aircraft reportedly fly without
notification or transponders functioning.78 In April 2015, there was a
particularly serious bomber incident. The UK press reported that two
Russian Tu-95 bombers flying over the English Channel were carrying at
least one "nuclear warheadcarrying missile, designed to seek and destroy
a Vanguard \[strategic ballistic missile\] submarine."79 The UK
protested this flight, reportedly over the threat it posed to air
navigation.80 On July 4, 2015, two Russian Tu-95 bombers reportedly flew
within 40 miles of the U.S. and taunted the U.S. pilots saying, "Good
morning American pilots, we are here to greet you on your Fourth of July
Independence Day."81 Since 2013, there has been a significant increase
in threatening flights by nuclear-capable bombers against Japan,
including a reported over-flight of a Japanese island.82 In 2015,
Reuters reported that the Japanese Air Force announced that "Russian
bombers and patrol planes often enter Japan's air space close to Japan's
northern Hokkaido island and close to four smaller islands which are
claimed both by Japan and Russia," and that Japanese fighter scrambles
against Russia and Chinese aircraft had returned to peak Cold War
levels.83 These flights are indicative of an increasingly hostile and
provocative posture toward both the West and Japan, intended to
strengthen Russia's political and military standing in support of
Moscow's national objectives. Russian nuclear exercises While
[[Russian]{.mark} [nuclear exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} are discussed
in more detail in the next chapter, their increasing [frequency and
aggressiveness [is a reflection of growing hostility]{.mark} toward the
West]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} also [demonstrate Russian views
concerning the linkage of nuclear weapons to Russia's expansionism and
war planning]{.underline}. Russian exercises, which mainly focus on
fighting the U.S., NATO and Japan, appear to emphasize nuclear
warfighting, starting with Russian first use of a small number of
nuclear weapons and escalating to general nuclear war.84 The Russians
routinely stage major strategic nuclear exercises and theater war
exercises simulating the use of nuclear weapons.85 In addition to the
normal training role these exercises serve, they likely are intended to
influence the actions of NATO states through the intimidating effect
they create. The unusual high-profile publicity given to nuclear
exercises in Russia appears designed to reinforce this effort at
intimidation. According to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, "Russia's
recent use of nuclear rhetoric, exercises and operations are deeply
troubling."86 Moreover, he noted that Russia has avoided reporting on
these exercises as required by the Vienna Document, agreed to by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and intended to
enable confidence-building measures that reduce the risk of hazardous
incidents that can lead to inadvertent conflict. 87 In the same year
that the draft Russian nuclear doctrine was made public, Russia
conducted the Zapad \[West\]-1999 theater war exercise, in which
then-Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev said Russia
simulated the first use of nuclear weapons: "Our Army was forced to
launch nuclear strikes first which enabled it to achieve a breakthrough
in the theater situation."88 Alexander Golts wrote that "the enemy
looked just exactly like NATO did in Yugoslavia."89 Russian press
accounts stated that Russia responded with limited nuclear strikes using
cruise missiles launched from Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers "against
countries from whose territories the offensive was launched."90 The use
of strategic bombers with nuclear cruise missiles was repeated in later
Zapad exercises.91 In 2009, the London Daily Telegraph reported, "The
\[Russian\] armed forces are said to have carried out 'war games' in
which nuclear missiles were fired and troops practiced an amphibious
landing on the country's \[Poland's\] coast."92 In this case, the weapon
reportedly used was a tactical nuclear weapon.93 A senior NATO official
told Reuters that Russia's Zapad exercise in 2013 was "supposed to be a
counter-terrorism exercise but it involved the (simulated) use of
nuclear weapons."94 The Russians have also reportedly simulated first
use of nuclear weapons in the Vostok \[East\] exercises and in exercises
conducted in the Indian Ocean.95 Russian strategic nuclear exercises
have become larger and, since 2012, have been presided over personally
by President Putin. In 2013, while Putin hosted a meeting of the G-20
Presidents and Prime Ministers at St. Petersburg, Russia announced it
was conducting a large ICBM force exercise--the timing of which was
hardly coincidental.96 The simulated first use of nuclear weapons is
consistent with Russian concepts of conflict "deescalation," which was
part of the theoretical basis of Putin's nuclear first-use doctrine.97
Writing in May 1999, Major-General V.I. Levshin, Colonel A.V. Nedelin,
and Colonel M. Ye Sergeyev described the concept of "de-escalation of
military operations" as follows: "Fulfilling the de-escalation concept
is understood to mean actually using nuclear weapons both for showing
resolve as well as for the immediate delivery of nuclear strikes against
the enemy ....It seems to us that the cessation of military operations
will be the most acceptable thing for the enemy in this case."98 The
2014--2015 European security crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of
the Ukraine has resulted in a dramatic increase in both nuclear and
conventional Russian military exercises. Russian exercises and what
Russia calls "snap drills" reportedly will reach astounding levels in
2015 (an announcement of 4,000 planned in 2015, including 120 involving
the ICBM force).99 The senior U.S. Army general in Europe, Lt. General
Ben Hodges, says Russia has demonstrated the capability to deploy 30,000
troops and 1,000 tanks "really fast."100 Early in the Ukraine crisis, in
March 2014, the Russian Strategic Missile Troops conducted a nuclear
exercise which reportedly involved a "massive" nuclear strike.101 In May
2014, Russia announced a very large strategic nuclear exercise involving
live launches of tactical and strategic nuclear missiles and missile and
bomber defense interceptors. Russia again said the exercise---in which a
number of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Presidents
participated---ended in a "massive" nuclear strike.102 In February 2015,
Russia conducted what was characterized as the largest ICBM exercise
ever,103 involving 30 ICBM regiments operating in six regions of
Russia.104 In March 2015, Russia conducted "snap drills" involving
strategic nuclear missile submarines, strategic bombers, and the forward
deployment of nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad. Noted
Russian journalist, Pavel Felgenhauer, wrote that the exercise was
intended to send "a clear message: Moscow is not ready to stand down and
is threatening the use of force, including nuclear weapons."105 Russia's
theater exercises with simulated nuclear weapons use have also
threatened Japan. The Russian Vostok \[East\]-2010 exercise reportedly
simulated the use of tactical nuclear weapons and, in part, was fought
in the Kuril Islands claimed by Japan.106 Despite Japan's protest, the
Vostok-2014 exercise, also reportedly involved fighting in the Kuril
Islands and was a nuclear exercise.107 Russia did not even try to hide
the fact that the exercise was directed against the U.S. and Japan.108
Russian sources called it the largest exercise in Russian history.109
These types of exercises go beyond simple defensive military training.
The extent of the simulated use of nuclear weapons is unprecedented and
the geographical reach of these exercises is clearly designed to send a
strong message to the West and Japan. Forward deployment of
nuclear-capable systems Russian officials have frequently made threats
to forward deploy nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad (a
Russian enclave on the border with Poland). For example, President
Dmitry Medvedev threatened to do so the day after Barack Obama was
elected U.S. President.110 Russia appears to believe that the forward
deployment of nuclear systems makes the threat more credible and, thus,
enhances Russian political and military leverage with the states that
are threatened. The likely goal is to convince these states that
defending themselves against a Russia willing to employ nuclear weapons
to attain its foreign policy objectives is a losing proposition and that
accommodation with Russia is the better part of valor. In fact, Russia
reportedly already has deployed nuclear-capable delivery vehicles to
Crimea, including Backfire bombers and Iskander missiles.111 Russia's
most modern nuclear-capable fighter bomber, the Su-34, also appears to
have been deployed near Crimea.112 And, it is possible that Russian
nuclear weapons have also already been deployed there---the Secretary of
Ukraine's National Security Council has stated that Russia is in the
process of doing so.113 Earlier this year, Russia's nuclear weapons
handling organization, the 12th Main Directorate of the General Staff,
announced that Russia is deploying a nuclear weapons handling unit to
Crimea.114 Additionally, according to Russian press accounts, Russia is
deploying advanced nuclear-armed equipment to Kamchatka, the area of the
Russian mainland nearest Japan, including the new Borei class nuclear
ballistic missile submarine and the S-400 advanced air defense
weapon.115 The Russian military buildup The growing militarization of
Russia is a manifestation of its growing hostility toward the West.
Russian expatriate Alexei Bayer notes that Russia today is "bursting
with negative energy, hatred of the outside world and enthusiasm for
confrontation."116 Confrontation requires military capability, and
Moscow is channeling a significant amount of resources and energy toward
investing in and building up this capability, with military expenditures
now reported to be nine percent of Russian GNP.117 According to former
Duma member, Vladimir Ryzhkov, the Russian media "promotes the idea that
Russia exists in a hostile environment, that it is locked in a
confrontation with the United States and the West---because of which the
country must remain on the constant war footing of a 'besieged
fortress,' arm itself against foreign aggressors and crack down on
domestic enemies ranging from the intelligentsia to ordinary
discontents."118 Russian modernization and expansion of its conventional
and nuclear capabilities (described in Chapter Four) enhance Russia's
ability to implement its provocative threats, particularly in light of
the defense spending reductions that have been underway in the United
States and virtually every NATO state.119 This situation is more ominous
in light of the asymmetry in approaches to nuclear weapons and the
West's lack of emphasis on nuclear deterrence. In 2005, then-Chief of
the Russian General Staff General Baluyevski stated, "at present and in
the foreseeable future the threat to Russia's security from abroad is
fairly small," and hence, he added, Russia would not "increase the
number of our deployed missiles and the weapons they carry" because
"this would have taken us nowhere ..."120 That policy was reversed by
2011. Russia is now expanding its strategic nuclear forces both
quantitatively and qualitatively.121 This force buildup appears intended
to support Russian expansionism via nuclear coercion, not the West's
Cold War concept of stable mutual deterrence.122 Arms control policies,
which are discussed in Chapter Five, have contributed to the feasibility
and the intimidation potential of the Russian nuclear buildup. The New
START Treaty has made it economically possible for the Russians to match
and then exceed U.S. strategic nuclear capabilities in numeric terms. As
former Vice Chairman of the Duma Defense Committee, Aleksei Arbatov has
observed, "It is essentially a treaty on limiting the American strategic
forces ....If we want our strategic nuclear forces---as the basis of the
country's defense capability and of its status in the world---to have
equality with the United States and if parity is important to us, then
the new START Treaty makes it much easier for us to maintain it."123 As
is detailed in Chapter Five, Russia has used arms control and arms
control noncompliance to help obtain nuclear capabilities that underpin
Russian coercive nuclear threats. As the U.S National Intelligence
Council observed in a December 2012 report, not only is Russia expanding
and modernizing its strategic and tactical nuclear forces, but Russia is
"pursuing new concepts and capabilities for expanding the role of
nuclear weapons in its security strategy," while the U.S. is going in
the opposite direction.124 Among these concepts reportedly are precision
low-yield nuclear weapons and special low collateral damage weapons.125
These are the types of weapons that Russia reportedly will have a
monopoly, or near-monopoly on, and which are well suited to Russia's
strategy of nuclear intimidation.126 A now-declassified CIA report in
2000 links Russian nuclear doctrine to its new nuclear weapons:
"Moscow's military doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons has been
evolving and probably has served as the justification for the
development of very low-yield, high-precision nuclear weapons."127 It
also noted that the potential use of subkiloton nuclear weapons by
Russia "could include artillery, air-toair missiles, ABM weapons,
satellite weapons, or multiple rocket launchers against tanks or massed
troops."128 In 1998, Russian journalists Vladimir Kucherenko and Aleksey
Podymov reported the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry was working to
"create highly accurate 'clean' third-generation nuclear weapons
...which can be very compact by containing the equivalent of several
dozen or hundreds of metric tons of TNT."129 There are now reports by
well-known Russian journalists concerning Russian deployment of such
weapons on its [new strategic nuclear missiles]{.underline}.130 In April
2009, Vice Admiral Oleg Burtsev, Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff,
stated, "There is no longer any need to equip missiles with powerful
nuclear warheads ....We can install low-yield warheads on existing
cruise missiles."131 And in 2014, Russian Defense Minister General of
the Army Sergei Shoigu said, "Given the role and significance of
long-range precision weapons in strategic deterrence, the number of
precision-weapon delivery vehicles is expected to increase fourfold
before 2021."132 These weapons appear to [buttress Russian nuclear
threats]{.underline}, including nuclear first-use threats, and Russian
efforts to coerce its neighbors into accepting a renewed
Russian-dominated sphere of influence.133 Russia appears to believe it
can exploit the West's fear of war, particularly nuclear war, to force
Eastern Europeans to accept Russian dominance and
"Russification"134---with Western Europe's coerced acceptance.
Correspondingly, the abrogation of arms control agreements and the
development and deployment of new weapons, both nuclear and
conventional, appear intended to intimidate.135 Russia, for example, has
recently given considerable publicity to the claimed capabilities of its
new Armata tank and new infantry combat vehicles which were recently
shown in the Moscow Victory Day parade.136 Large displays of modern
Russian military equipment are made in the annual Victory Day military
parades, 137 and there is constant reporting in the Russian state-run
media on new and supposedly unmatched Russian weapons capabilities,
including a new long-range, underwater drone weapon armed with a
largeyield nuclear warhead.138 The July 2015 Russian disclosure that
"more than eighty warships and support vessels of various classes" were
on duty at sea is another example of this type of signaling.139
Conclusion [[Moscow's confrontational approach]{.mark} toward the
West]{.underline}, including Japan, [[is a manifestation of]{.mark}
Russia's [overall grand]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} as
outlined in Chapter One and its expressed threat perceptions. [The
aim]{.underline} of this policy [is [to recover the great power status
of the Soviet Union]{.mark} by creating a Russian sphere of domination
over former Soviet territory]{.underline}. Mounting Russian hostility
toward the West is reflected in increasing Russian suppression of
democracy, the Russian nuclear and conventional military buildup, its
constant military threats, its nuclear threats and exercises, its
military aggression in Ukraine, and its intensifying pressure on smaller
states and neutrals. Russia seeks to exploit the Western fear of war,
particularly nuclear war, by a variety of nuclear threats, doctrinal
statements about the first use of nuclear weapons, predictions of war,
including nuclear war, well-publicized military exercises involving
first use of nuclear weapons against the United States and its allies,
threatened and actual forward deployment of nuclear systems, threats to
deploy new types of super weapons, threats to abrogate arms control
agreements, and actual Russian violations of existing agreements. The
upgrading of Russian military power and the advertisement of its
capabilities by publicity, military exercises, provocative aircraft
flights, and military threats are a key part of this strategy. [In light
of current Russian economic and conventional military weakness, nuclear
weapons and nuclear threats play a central role in this Russian strategy
of intimidation]{.underline}. **[The [potential for
miscalc]{.mark}ulation, crises, [and conflict are]{.mark} fully
[apparent]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark} this combination of
[Russian]{.mark} goals and [strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Russia will first-use nuclear weapons

For example, the [[many official Russian statements
claim]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[Russia's right to deploy nuclear
weapons]{.underline} [in Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark} reflects efforts to
intimidate the West from acting against Moscow and to convey Moscow's
determination to retain Crimea, and thus to deter any action against its
overall policies in Ukraine. Russian nuclear weapons and multiplying
nuclear threats---including long-range bomber patrols against the United
States and Europe---aim to deter any Western action against Russia, and
to intimidate the West into accepting Russian conquests as irrevocable
faits accompli. [[This]{.mark} [political use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
[is not confined to the present crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similar
moves reportedly occurred during the 2008 Georgian war,49 affirming
Moscow's belief that if it lacked nuclear weapons, the West might
intervene against Russian aggression in the CIS. [[Russia sees its
nuclear arsenal]{.mark},]{.underline} in part, [[as the instrument that
can prevent]{.mark} robust [Western]{.mark} responses to its aggression
and [occupation of neighboring territories]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
a new and fundamentally coercive role for Russian nuclear weapons and
does not reflect Western mutual nuclear deterrence notions of the Cold
War. [[Russian statements about nuclear weapons have moved
beyond]{.mark} the clear [desire]{.mark} to deter and
[intimidate]{.mark} the West to include potential operational
employment]{.underline}. As the British analyst Roger McDermott has
written, [The Russian military understanding of these weapons and
reliance on them in certain scenarios suggests that they play a
significant role in security thinking, which]{.underline} has grown and
[may continue to grow]{.underline} until Russia can successfully redress
its conventional weaknesses. This is borne out in official statements,
as well as in the role assigned to them in operational-strategic
exercises .... [[It is]{.mark} therefore [important]{.mark} to
understand [that Russia regards these weapons differently]{.mark} than
the West: [for Moscow]{.mark} they do not simply have political value,
they play a role in military planning that [compensates for conventional
weakness]{.mark}, and [in]{.mark} certain scenarios are considered to be
operational systems]{.underline}.50 [Thus, Russian [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether they be strategic or tactical
nuclear weapons **[could]{.underline}**, in severe circumstances, **[be
used in combat operations]{.underline}**. The apparent Russian
willingness to employ nuclear weapons likely contributes to their
coercive effect.

It is practically a cliché in international relations: \"Russia without
Ukraine is a country, Russia with Ukraine is an empire.\"
[Putin]{.underline}\'s Russia [appears to believe that reclaiming
great-power status is the only way it can guarantee
security]{.underline} against a hostile West. Jeffrey Lewis, an arms
control expert, traced this Russian government obsession with Ukraine
back to Putin\'s political weakness at home, as well as Russia\'s sense
of military insecurity against a hostile and overwhelmingly powerful
West. \"I suspect that [[the desire to unite the Russian world
and]{.mark} to **[subjugate]{.mark} the non-Russian
[neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is driven by]{.mark} a fundamental
sense of [insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Lewis said in a
much-circulated September podcast on Putin\'s nuclear threats. \"That[,
like the Soviet leadership, he has to try very hard to stay in power,
and]{.underline} so [there's a tendency as his legitimacy declines to
try to blame outside forces.]{.underline} And the problem is that when
you try to look at the world in that conspiratorial way, [there's always
a justification for subjugating the next set of
neighbors.\"]{.underline} This means that [should the US or other
Western countries become sufficiently involved]{.underline} in Ukraine
[that Russia cannot maintain control of the conflict, then [Russia may
feel]{.mark} this puts it at such **existential threat** that [it has no
choice but to **escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline} in response. **[[Even at
the risk of war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Russia knows it would lose a
full-blown war with NATO,]{.underline} of course, [but]{.underline} it
has other options. An official with the Russian Defense Ministry\'s
public advisory board told the Moscow Times that should Western
countries arm Ukraine\'s military, it would respond by escalating in
Ukraine itself as well as \"asymmetrically against Washington or its
allies on other fronts.\" [[Russian]{.mark} asymmetrical
[acts]{.mark}]{.underline} --- cyberattacks, propaganda operations meant
to create panic, military flights, even little green men --- are all
effective precisely because they [[introduce]{.underline} **[uncertainty
and risk]{.underline}**]{.mark}. If that sounds dangerous, it is.
[[American and NATO red lines]{.mark} for what acts of \"asymmetry\"
would and would not trigger war [are **unclear and poorly defined**.
Russia could **easily cross**]{.mark} **such a line [without meaning
to]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} could [create enough confusion]{.mark} that
[the US]{.mark} believes it or its allies are under a severe enough
threat to **[demand retaliation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \"[You don\'t
get to walk this back]{.underline},\" Matthew Rojansky, the director of
the Kennan Institute, warned in comments to the New York Times about
what could happen if the US armed Ukraine\'s military, as Congress is
pushing Obama to do. \"[Once we have done this we become]{.underline} a
belligerent [party in a]{.underline} proxy [war with
Russia]{.underline}, [the **only country on Earth** that can destroy the

Since officially coming to power in May 2000, if not before, Russian
President [Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} sought to restore
Russia's image as a Great Power in the context of zero-sum
anti-Westernism--- for Russia to win, the West had to lose. His
[[approach]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}ast is the
extension of]{.underline} former Russian prime minister Evgeniy
Primakov's vision [of a "multipolar world]{.underline},"
[[driven]{.mark} [by desire to prevent]{.mark} the [West from
dominatin]{.mark}g any region]{.underline}, and curb Western support for
democratization efforts in other countries. For the last 17 years, Putin
[worked to regain political influence and [raise Russia to the status
of]{.mark} a competitor to the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[by]{.mark} [increasing]{.mark}]{.underline} emphasis on Russia's
business interests---primarily [[arms]{.underline}]{.mark}, energy and
high-tech goods such as nuclear reactors.5 Russia's economy remains
over-reliant on raw materials and natural resources, but [the
[defense]{.mark} industry is one technology-intensive sector where
Russia holds an international leadership position]{.underline}.
Domestically, Russia's [defense industry is a major source of Russia's
[Arms Sales]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir Putin
renewed his emphasis on modernizing the armed forces, especially the
navy, on May 7, 2012, on the same day as he took office as president for
a third time.6 [Internationally, the Russian defense industry is a
source of [important revenue]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, Putin lamented
in February 2012 about Iraq and countries undergoing the Arab Spring,
"Russian companies are losing their decades-long positions in local
commercial markets and are being deprived of large commercial
contracts."7 As Sergei Chemezov, chief of the powerful state industrial
holding Rostec, said in February 2015, "As for the conflict situation in
the Middle East, I do not conceal it, and everyone understands this, the
more conflicts there are, the more they \[clients\] buy weapons from us.
Volumes are continuing to grow despite sanctions. Mainly, it is in Latin
America and the Middle East."8 Yet, [[arms]{.mark} [sales]{.mark}
[entail]{.mark} far [more]{.mark} to the Kremlin [than]{.mark} mere
[financial gains]{.mark}. They [are]{.mark} also Moscow's [tactical
foreign policy tool for wielding political influence]{.mark} [and
changing power balance dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, in July
2012, Putin said that arms exports are "[an effective instrument for
[advancing]{.mark} \[Moscow's\] national [interests]{.mark}, both
[political and economic]{.mark}]{.underline}."9 In December 2013, Deputy
Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said that [Russia's [arms sales]{.mark}
are the most [important element of Moscow's relations]{.mark} with other
countries]{.underline}.10 And Moscow's chief goal---regime survival,
which it hopes to achieve through reduction of Western influence---runs
counter to Western interests and values. Thus, in the MENA region,
Moscow courts virtually everyone, and competes with the West whenever an
opportunity arises. Arms exports are a major component of these efforts.

[Short of war itself, the [international]{.mark} [political]{.mark} and
[strategic]{.mark} [relations]{.mark} [between Russia]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates are about as
[bad]{.mark}]{.underline} as they can be. Indeed, it is [no exaggeration
to say that the simultaneous conduct of [two]{.mark} air [independent
campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline} over Syria [[could evolve]{.mark} all too
suddenly [into]{.mark} a [war]{.mark} triggered by accident or by
miscalculatio]{.underline}n. There is little, if any, mystery about the
broad political purpose fueling Vladimir Putin's conduct of
international relations. Subtlety is not a characteristic of Russian
statecraft; cunning and intended trickery, though, are another matter.
Stated directly, [[Putin]{.mark} is [striving to recover]{.mark} and
restore that of which he is able from the late USSR]{.underline}. There
is no ideological theme in his governance. Instead, there is an
[historically unremarkable [striving]{.mark} [after]{.mark} more [power
and influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. The challenge for the Western World,
as demonstrated in this National Institute study in meticulous and
troubling detail, is to decide where and when this latest episode in
[Russian [expansionism]{.mark}]{.underline} will be stopped. What we do
know, for certain, is that it [[must]{.mark} and will [be
halte]{.mark}]{.underline}[d]{.mark}. It is more likely than not that
[[Putin]{.mark} himself [does not have]{.mark} entirely [fixed]{.mark}
[political-strategic objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. His behavior of
recent years has given a credible impression of opportunistic
adaptability. In other words, he will take what he is able, where he
can, and when he can. However, there is ample evidence to support this
study's proposition [that Russian state policy today is driven by a
clear vision of Russia as a recovering and somewhat restored superpower,
very much on the high road back to a renewed hegemony]{.underline} over
Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Putin's international political
objectives appear largely open today: [[he will have Russia take]{.mark}
[whatever]{.mark} turns out to be [available to
take]{.mark}]{.underline}, preferably if the taking allows for some
humiliation of the principal enemy, the United States. A practical
political and strategic problem for Putin is to guess just [[how]{.mark}
[far he dares to push]{.mark} NATO in general and the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates in particular, [before]{.mark} [he finds
himself]{.mark}, almost certainly unexpectedly, [in a situation
analogous to 1939]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Just how dangerous
would it be for Russia to press forcefully the Baltic members of NATO?
Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [not be the]{.mark}
[first]{.mark} statesman [to trust his luck]{.mark} once too often,
based upon unrealistic confidence in his own political genius and
power]{.underline}. There is danger not only [that [Putin]{.mark} [could
miscalculate the military worth of Russia's hand]{.mark}, but that [he
also will misunderstand]{.mark} the practical political and strategic
[strength]{.mark} [of]{.mark} NATO '[red lines]{.mark}]{.underline}.' In
particular, Putin may well discover, despite some current appearances,
that [[not all of NATO]{.mark}'s political leaders are expediently
impressionable and very [readily deterrable]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Putin's [[military]{.mark} instrument is heavily [dependent]{.mark},
indeed probably over-dependent, [upon]{.mark} the [bolstering]{.mark}
value of a whole inventory of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
is [[unlikely to have evaded]{.mark} [Putin's]{.mark} strategic
[grasp]{.mark} [to recognize]{.mark} that [these are]{.mark}
[not]{.mark} simply [weapons]{.mark} [like any others.]{.mark}
[A]{.mark} single [political]{.mark} or strategic guess in
[error]{.mark} [could]{.mark} well [place us]{.mark}, Russians
inc[l]{.mark}uded, [in a world horrifically new]{.mark} to
all.]{.underline}

[[Russia's]{.mark} [interest]{.mark} is [far]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
purely [economic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russian [federal law
states]{.mark} that [strengthening military]{.mark} [and political
positions]{.mark} abroad [is the primary goal]{.mark} of Russian
military-industrial cooperation]{.underline}, and [[Russia]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} undoubtedly [use]{.mark} its [arms exports]{.mark}
industry [to]{.mark} attempt to [affect]{.mark} the [balance of power
in]{.mark} the [Middle East]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Its position in [Syria has cemented its role as a 'game
changer']{.underline} in the region, and it [has used its arms industry
strategically before]{.underline}. For instance, in 2012, [Moscow's
[decision]{.mark} [to stop]{.mark} the sale of [S-300s]{.mark} to Syria
[helped]{.mark} Moscow improve its [relations with Tel
Aviv]{.mark}]{.underline} while in 2016, the [deployment of the [S-300s
in Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} paved the way for the [[develop]{.mark}ment
of the Russian-[Irani]{.mark}an [dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some
even say then president (now prime minister) Dmitry [Medvedev's decision
to [halt]{.mark} [arms]{.mark} exports [to Libya]{.mark}]{.underline} in
2011 was one of the factors that [[led]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [fall of
Gaddafi]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The exact share of the Middle East in Russian arms sales remains unknown
and estimates range as widely as from 8.2 per cent to 37.5 per cent
(\$1.2--5.5 billion dollars) of total arms exports -- Russian [customs
officials]{.underline} only [confirm the [growing]{.mark} numbers of
Russian [weapons consumers]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. Moscow's
[[positions]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Middle East [are still
[vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline} -- weapons exports are an unstable
source of income as volumes vary annually and the needs of importers
change. The existing capacities of Russian producers and the economic
crisis also put constraints on the Moscow's abilities to further
increase its share.

[But arms exports mean that [importers]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} the
[help]{.mark}]{.underline} of their suppliers to service and upgrade the
weapons. This, at least, [[creates]{.mark} [long-term]{.mark} dependent
[relations]{.mark} [between buyer and
seller]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Under these circumstances, Russian
[officials are confident of a more permanent Russian

In recent years [[Russia]{.mark} has [staged]{.mark} a [comeback]{.mark}
in the Mideast]{.underline}, big time, to the extent that [it [may
replace]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as]{.mark} the
[leading foreign power]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. Russia\'s
[[success]{.underline}]{.mark} has been a
[[combination]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} both deft
[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} [as well as
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} and nuclear reactor sales to states
throughout the region, from Iran to Morocco. The [[weak]{.mark}ness of
[U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} regional
[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark} under the Obama administration, [[followed
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the total [[chaos]{.underline}]{.mark} under
Trump, have further [contributed]{.underline} to Russia\'s success.
Russian policy has been sophisticated, but has also benefited from the
void left by the United States.

President Putin\'s fundamental [strategic [objective]{.mark} is to
restore Russian global leadership]{.underline}, or to put it somewhat
less delicately, to [[stick it]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates wherever possible]{.underline}. His primary problem is
that [Russia [does not have that much to offer]{.mark}]{.underline}
today, it cannot compete with the United States and Western countries on
an economic level, or alternatively on a diplomatic one, and
[[all]{.mark} [it does]{.mark} have to offer [is
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, nuclear technology, and energy.

The [[M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}ast is one of the [primary]{.mark}
[regions]{.mark} in the world [in which Russia]{.mark} [can]{.mark}
[pursue]{.mark} its [ambitions]{.mark} today]{.underline}. Most [global
[weapons sales are with M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}astern states, and a
[race]{.mark} is underway among them [to procure]{.mark} nuclear power
[reactors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moscow\'s willingness to sell them
weapons and reactors, and to maintain close relations with rogue regimes
such as those in Damascus and Teheran, provide it with a degree of
influence that it does not have in much of the rest of the world.

[[Arms exports]{.mark} have [always]{.mark} been [part of]{.mark}
Russia's multi-faceted [diplomacy in]{.mark} the [M]{.mark}iddle
[E]{.mark}ast]{.underline}, and they have proven to be an effective
means of political messaging.

Moscow [began [using]{.mark} its [defense]{.mark} industry]{.underline}
as a tool [[for forging]{.mark} and cementing [alliances]{.mark} [as
early as]{.mark} the [Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}. Back then, a host
of Arab dictatorships, including Egypt, Iraq, Libya and Syria, depended
on Soviet-produced arms for survival.

Soviet [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} that often were struggling
economically [[benefited from]{.mark} arms [deals]{.mark}]{.underline}
that came [[with loans]{.mark}, hefty [discounts and no]{.mark}
political [agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} attached. Some of the Soviet
clients in the Middle East embraced the Communist ideology and some
didn't. But that was never a problem for Moscow.

The bottom line for the Soviet Union was that its [regional [clients
allowed it to counter American expansion]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Middle East and create a front away from its own borders.

It would be easy to question the effectiveness of the Soviet strategy of
injecting loads of weapons in the Middle East as a way of projecting its
influence in the region. But [Russia's dramatic [re-emergence]{.mark} in
the region]{.underline} in recent years goes to [show]{.underline} just
how much of its [come-back]{.underline} actually
[[depended]{.underline}]{.mark} [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the regimes
that were [once Soviet [clients]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[manipulation of arms]{.underline}]{.mark} exports to the Middle
East [[to alter]{.mark} the [behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} its [allies]{.underline} is something that Moscow
[[mastered during]{.mark} the [Cold War]{.mark} and [still resorts to
today]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, when the Syrian army occupied

This [growing web of [arms deals]{.mark} strengthens Russia's "soft"
power by helping [bring]{.mark} [Asia]{.mark}n states [into]{.mark}
[Moscow's sphere of influence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Weapons agreements
should be understood as contributors to a broader military relationship,
as opposed to discrete transactions (one does not buy S-400 air defence
systems at the supermarket). [Russia is [increasing]{.mark}ly taking
part in [joint military exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} with its
Southeast Asian security customers, for instance.

The [preponderance of Russian [arms]{.mark} in Asia has [brought]{.mark}
its share of unintended [consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline} Experts deem
Southeast Asia a "crossroads" for [small [arms smuggling]{.mark} and
[weapons trafficking]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To take just one
example, United Nations estimates suggest there are more than 1,100,000
unregistered guns in the Philippines. 26 people are killed every day by
small arms, a number on the rise since President Rodrigo Duterte assumed
office with a message of outright support for vigilante murder.

While it is inherently difficult to quantify the number of Russian arms
in this deluge of illegal arms, [Southeast Asian states have a sketchy
track record]{.underline} for maintaining control over foreign weapons.
This uncertainty [[aligns]{.mark} dangerously [with the rise of
extremism and terror]{.mark}ism in the region]{.underline}.

Some journalists have even raised concerns that groups such as ISIS are
receiving weapons trafficked through Southeast Asian hubs such as
Thailand and Malaysia. The Malaysian Border Security Agency
director-general has not exactly quelled fears, going on the record to
admit "it's not easy to detect a person attempting to sneak in weapons."

In any case, [the [rise]{.mark} and rise of Russia as a regional arms
giant is of [significant consequence]{.mark} to the entire
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}.

The [Kremlin's [export drive]{.mark} in South and Southeast Asia
[represents]{.mark} an ongoing [expansion of Russian
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As]{.mark} regional [tensions]{.mark}
[around]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea continue
to [build]{.mark},]{.underline} we should well expect [[more
states]{.mark} to [join the queue]{.mark} in buying Russian
weapons.]{.underline}

[[Each]{.mark} arms [deal]{.mark} [helps solidify ties]{.mark} between
Moscow]{.underline} and its customers ([particularly those fearful of an
expansionist China]{.underline}). [[Leveraging]{.mark} national [arms
production]{.mark} [to build]{.mark} Russian ["soft"

[From [Russia]{.mark}'s perspective]{.underline}, when it seeks military
export contracts, it is [not simply searching for a consumer with a
need, but is quite literally [inserting]{.mark} [weaponry]{.mark} and
military technologies [into a region]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [gain]{.mark}
or increase its [influence]{.mark} there]{.underline}. Rogozin (2013)
indicated that this is Russia's stance when he said, "They (the FSVTS)
trade arms only with friends and partners." [[Arms sales]{.mark} are one
of Russia's critical [tools]{.mark} [for]{.mark} building
[relationships]{.mark} in regions where it has interests.]{.underline}

[[Russia perceives]{.mark} trends in [arms sales]{.mark} and the defense
industry to be [crucial to achieving a great power position in
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}, if not globally. Since 2008, Asia is an ever
greater Russian priority. [[If Russia fails to compete]{.mark} with its
rivals in arms sales to Asia, [it will lose ground]{.mark} regionally
and globally]{.underline} (Blank and Kim 2013). Therefore, [[Russia
targets East Asia for]{.mark} military [exports]{.mark}]{.underline} not
only because there is tremendous current demand for arms in region, but
also because [it is a geostrategic necessity]{.underline}. Due to the
[enormous economic and geopolitical importance of East
Asia]{.underline}, [[Russia needs access]{.mark} and influence in the
region [to secure and advance]{.mark} its own [economic and geostrategic
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, sales to major Asian players
like India and China are a key component of its ability to conduct a
sovereign independent foreign policy both in Asia and globally (Blank
and Kim). This is also the reason why it continues to seek
military-technical cooperation with other countries in the Western
Pacific.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[uses]{.mark} its [arms
trade]{.mark} [with Vietnam]{.mark} in a similar way]{.underline}. It is
a well known in South-East Asia [that [Russia]{.mark} [desires]{.mark} a
modest amount of [access]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the underwater natural
[resources]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}e]{.underline}a. As such, it was no surprise to experts in the
region when [joint [Russo-Vietnamese]{.mark}]{.underline} resource
extraction and energy development [[agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} were
established. Russia [[achieved]{.mark} this access partly
[through]{.mark} the [assistance]{.mark} it gave to Vietnam [in
building]{.mark} a [nuclear]{.mark} power [plant]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, Russia [[also]{.mark} sold Vietnam a third tranche of the
[sale]{.mark} [of 20]{.mark} new SU-30MK2 [fighter
aircraft]{.mark}]{.underline} (which can target ships, aerial and ground
targets), as well as six Project 636 Varshavyanka-class submarines,
which are upgraded Kilo-class submarines that can more effectively
conduct anti-submarine, anti-ship, general reconnaissance, and patrols
in relatively shallow waters like the South China Sea (Blank 2013b).
Such [arms sales,]{.underline} of course, [[help Vietnam]{.mark}
[solidify]{.mark} its [claims]{.mark} over the areas [where Russia wants
to extract resources]{.mark}, territories [that]{.mark} also [happen to
be claimed by China]{.mark}]{.underline}. This, of course, is an
excellent example of [Russia using its military exports to directly
defend an economic interest especially an energy interest]{.underline}

Spurred by a revised business strategy and favorable international
climate[, [Russia's]{.mark} chief [arms exporter\--
Rosoboronexport]{.mark}]{.underline}\-- [[is seeing **record**
profits]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Rosoboronexport]{.mark} has [sold 5.7
billion]{.mark} dollars worth of weapons since the beginning of 2019,
[setting the]{.mark} Russian defense [industry up for its
strongest]{.mark}-grossing [year]{.mark} decades]{.underline}. Though
[[2019]{.underline}]{.mark} is shaping up to be a particularly
profitable earnings period on the heels of Moscow's multi-billion dollar
S-400 deal with Ankara, this [[cannot be dismissed as a one-off
occurrence]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Currently sitting at a whopping 55
billion dollars, [Rosoboronexport's portfolio has **steadily
grown**]{.mark} over the past decade]{.underline}. Agency chief
Alexander Mikheyev assured Russian state news that [Rosoboronexport is
not resting on its laurels]{.underline}: \"As a world arms export
leader, we are not only watching and following global trends today but
are also developing unique areas of work for the market, including
financial mechanisms for foreign trade activity.\" But can Russia\'s
arms trade sustain its impressive pace of growth over the coming
decades? Since the 2014 Crimean annexation, Rosoboronexport executives
have wasted no time in arguing that the the Russian defense industry
would be in even better financial shape were it not for the effects of
the western sanctions regime: \"For five years, Russia and
Rosoboronexport have been confronted with serious restrictions from some
international financial institutions that have become strongly dependent
on the political will of some world arms market players. We can only
perceive them as unfair competition and the attempts of pressure on us
and our partners,\" said Mikheyev. Mikheyev's claim is inarguably true
as far as the secondary effects of sanctions are concerned; the Kremlin
is currently being denied western capital inflows that, among other
things, could otherwise have contributed to the growth of the Russian
defense sector. However, sanctions have had no discernable effect on
Moscow's ability to secure a series of lucrative arms deals over the
past several years. The reason is hardly surprising: the nations most
likely to abide by the sanctions regime are western NATO members who are
already militarily and politically invested in NATO's defense
infrastructure, and thus were never prospective Russian clients to begin
with. Meanwhile, sanctions have done little to stop some of the world's
biggest arms importers from doing business with Russia. [It was only
last year that [India signed a]{.mark} gargantuan [5.43 billion]{.mark}
dollar weapons [deal]{.mark} with Russia]{.underline}. [There was talk
of punishing India under]{.underline} the Countering America\'s
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act ([CAATSA]{.underline}), [but
Washington is dragging its heels over concerns of alienating New
Delhi]{.underline}. [Washington successfully sanctioned China under
CAATSA, but this had no discernible effect on [the]{.mark} burgeoning
[Sino-Russian defense relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most recently,
[Moscow exploited the growing political rift between NATO-aligned Turkey
and the west to not only sell the S-400 to Ankara, but to secure
[a]{.mark} joint [Russian-Turkish manufacturing deal]{.mark} for its
upcoming S-500 anti air system]{.underline}. In keeping with their
ongoing export strategy of targeting prospective clients who are beyond
the reach of western sanctions, [[Rosoboronexport plans to make]{.mark}
further [inroads in Africa, Latin America, the Middle-East, and Central
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Furthermore, [the Russian arms trade
is aggressively competing for second and third world import markets with
a glut of cheaper, Soviet-inherited hardware that may lack the technical
bells and whistles of their latest offerings, but nonetheless offers
cost-effective performance for low and medium intensity
warfare]{.underline}[. [Rosoboronexport's]{.underline}]{.mark} [ongoing
[success presents]{.mark} the Washington security establishment with a

On November 6, Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of the
Commission for Military Technology Cooperation with Foreign States. He
noted that "Our capabilities in the military technical sphere must be
used to modernize and upgrade all our industries, to support our science
and to create a powerful technological potential for the country's
dynamic development." The president called for "renewed efforts, not
only, in preserving, but also, in strengthening Russia's leading
position on the global arms market, primarily in the high-tech sector,
amid tough competition." [[The US efforts]{.mark} to press other
countries [into suspending military cooperation with Russia are

demand]{.mark} for Russia's military production [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
especially [[high]{.mark} in the Asia-Pacific]{.underline} Region,
accounting for almost 70% of all arms sales, including India (35%),
China (12%) and Vietnam (10%).Today, [Russia's overall military exports
are equal to around \$15 billion]{.underline}, with the global order
book of \$55 billion. According to Alexander Mikheev, the head of
[[Rosoboronexport]{.underline}]{.mark}, the sole state intermediary
agency for Russia\'s defense exports / imports, Russia [[has]{.mark}
already [exported]{.mark} arms [to over 40 countries, signing 1,100
contracts]{.mark} worth about \$19 billion in 2018]{.underline} -- **[[a
25% increase]{.mark} compared to the last year]{.underline}**. The
president's speech coincided with the opening ceremony of Airshow China
2018 (Nov. 6-11), one of the five largest aerospace exhibitions in the
world, Russian manufacturers scored a big success. 14 defense producers
displayed over 200 units of hardware. [[China]{.mark} has defied US
threats to go through with the large deal [to buy S-400 air
defense]{.mark} systems and Su-35 multifunctional fighters]{.underline}
(ten jets already delivered). The joint programs, such as the
development of a heavy AHL helicopter and a long-range powerful
aircraft, are in force. The order book of China's imports exceeds \$7
billion, growing from 5% to 14-15%. The two nations are involved in a
joint project to produce diesel-electric submarines Amur-1650 (export
version of Lada Project 677). [This is a \$2 billion deal]{.underline}.
China confirmed the plan to purchase six Mi-171A2Y "Ansat" helicopters,
which will make a 5,000 km long demonstration tour across Southeast
Asia, including stops at Hanoi (Vietnam), Phnom Penh (Cambodia), Bangkok
(Thailand) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). VKO concern \"Almaz-Antey\" used
the Airshow China 2018 event to introduce the Viking -- the export
version of the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system. Viking boasts the
range of 65 km. 36 targets can be tracked and engaged simultaneously. It
has the capability of striking tactical ballistic and cruise missiles as
well as sea and ground targets. The Radioelectronic Technologies Company
(KRET) presented over 40 exhibits, including the multipurpose airborne
multipurpose radar with AFAR \"Beetle-AME\" designed to detect and track
aerial, surface and ground targets at the same time. The Russian-Chinese
long-overhaul CR929 jet attracted public attention at the air show. Its
basic version will carry 280 passengers over a distance of 12,000 km.
[[India]{.mark} has also defied the US pressure and [will start
receiving receive S-400s]{.mark} in the fall of 2020]{.underline}. [The
\$5 billion deal was signed in October during the visit of]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin to New Delhi]{.underline}. Russia and
Vietnam have signed a \$4.5 billion package of deals, including the \$1
billion purchase of a batch of Russian Su-30 MK2 fighters and a \$2
billion agreement on the sale of six Russian diesel-electric Project
636.1 Varshavyanka (Kilo) submarines. A Mi-35M attack helicopters deal
with to Bangladesh is expected to be inked soon. In February, Russia
signed a \$ 1.14 deal with Indonesia to supply 11 Su-35 4++ generation
fighters. 2018 is rich in international defense shows. As of November
12, Russia has taken part in about 20 international exhibitions and
forums, such as the Eurasian Air Show in Turkey's Antalya, International
Far Eastern Maritime Show in Vladivostok and ADAS-2018 defense
exhibition in the Philippines (for the first time). It intends to attend
some more large ones till the end of the year. Russia has also taken
part in the Indo Defense 2018 show (Nov.7-10) to display over 200
systems and equipment units. There were two weapons presented for the
first time ever in Jakarta: the 122 mm projectile for Tornado-G MLRS and
140 mm projectile for ship-based Ogon flame throwing launcher. There
will be the IDEAS-2018 exhibition in Pakistan in late November,
EDEX-2018 will be held in Egypt in mid-December, and Chile will host the
EXPONAVAL -- 2018 naval exhibition in early December. Russia will take
an active part in all of them though its presence at Le Bourget Paris
air show in June was very limited and it decided to take no part in
Farnborough -- 2018 air show in July. Moscow prefers the shows where it
has more potential customers. This year, some new systems were offered
to potential buyers, such the Viking and Tor-E2 anti-aircraft missile
systems, Sprut-SDM1 light floating tank, Karakut and Sarsar vessels,
Il-78MK-90A aerial tanker and Il-76MD-90A (E) military cargo aircraft.
The Sprut-SDM1 light tank is a special case. The airborne light
amphibious tank with firepower of MBT has no rivals in the world. [The
US-imposed sanctions have failed to reduce the demand for Russian
weapons. China, India as well as many other countries refuse to

talks to get around dollars are underway with China. Some deals may be
temporarily postponed, some talks frozen, but all in all, [the US policy
of using sanctions to reduce Russia arms exports and thus weaken the
competitor has failed]{.underline}. [The most important agreements,

The United States remains the global leader in arms sales, while
[[Russia has surpassed Britain]{.mark} to take the No. 2 spot as it

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said on

report](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2018/global-arms-industry-us-companies-dominate-top-100-russian-arms-industry-moves-second-place) that
the combined sales of arms and military services by U.S. companies rose
2 percent in 2017 to \$222.6 billion.

[Russia [became the second-largest arms producer]{.mark}, it said, with
\$37.7 billion, [up 8.5 percent from a year
earlie]{.mark}]{.underline}[r]{.mark}.

The [group [based]{.mark} its [calculations on the combined sales
of]{.mark} arms-related enterprises ranked among the [Top 100
producers]{.mark} worldwide]{.underline}. The United States had 42 of
the Top 100 companies, while Russia had 10, it said.

"[[Russian companies have experienced significant growth]{.mark} in
their arms sales since 2011]{.underline}," [[said]{.mark} Siemon
Wezeman, senior researcher with [SIPRI]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}s
Arms and Military Expenditure Program.

"This is [in line with Russia's increased spending on arms procurement
to modernize its armed forces]{.underline}," he added.

The report said that, for the first time, [a Russian company,
state-owned [Almaz-Antey]{.mark}, [appeared in]{.mark} the [Top
10]{.mark} in the ranking for global arms sales]{.underline}.

Alexandra Kuimova, a research assistant, said that Almaz-Antey, already
Russia's largest arms-producing company, increased arms sales 17 percent
in 2017 to \$8.6 billion.

[The report said that along with Almaz-Antey, [three other Russian Top
100 firms increased their arms sales by more than 15
percent]{.mark}]{.underline}: United Engine (25 percent), High Precision
Systems (22 percent), and Tactical Missiles (19 percent).

Although the [[Russia-Turkey contract for]{.mark} the S-400 [missile

The [same applies to the new Russia-Egypt contract for Su-35 fighters.
[Egypt is among most important U.S. partners in the region and its

[[to acquire more than \$5.4 billion in arms and military
equipment]{.underline}]{.mark} during the IDEX conference, [in spite of
ongoing calls to end the war in Yemen, in which the UAE plays a leading
role.]{.underline} At least \$1.9 billion was allocated to deals with US
firms Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to purchase air defence missiles,
according to a Reuters report. [Rosoboronexport Director
General]{.underline} Alexander Mikheev [told reporters that
[Russia]{.mark} had [received]{.mark} [a request from the UAE to

separate purchase of Russian Kornet-E anti-tank missile systems worth
**\$40 million**]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a statement by UAE
Brigadier General Mohammed Al Hassani. The Kornet was a favourite of
armed militias and insurgents as far back as the 1990s, seeing heavy use
in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and most notably Yemen. The rockets are
prized for their ease of use, and for giving light infantry the ability
to stand up to heavy armour and conventional armies. "Emirati forces
receive billions of dollars' worth of arms from Western states and
others, only to siphon them off to militias in Yemen that answer to
no-one and are known to be committing war crimes,\" noted Patrick
Wilcken, arms control researcher at Amnesty International. [[Bilateral
**ties between the two countries**]{.mark} **however, [have]{.mark} only
[seen steady improvement in recent years]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On the
same day the deals were declared, Russia announced visas on arrival for
Emirati passport holders, and further announced through Tass, Russia's
state media agency, that the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) had
reached \$2 billion in 2019 from Saudi Arabian and Emirati investments,
with the number only expected to rise. This is in addition to bilateral
cooperation agreements from late 2018 between Russia and the UAE on
areas of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and the creation of a
Russian industrial zone in Egypt, based on an agreement dating to 2014.
Only six months earlier, the UAE reached an agreement with Russia to
send its first astronaut into space, as part of a bid to kickstart its
envisioned space industry.

[[Russia's]{.mark} [econ]{.mark}omy [is growing]{.mark}]{.underline},
albeit slowly, VTB Capital (VTBC) said in a note following the release
of the Russian Federal Statistics Service, or Rosstat's May statistics.
The first tier data for May [shows that retail sales [rose 1.4 percent
year-on-year]{.mark}, with the turnover in the food and non-food
segments increasing modestly, by 1.7 percent and 1.0 percent
year-on-year, respectively]{.underline}. Real wages have been stagnating
for almost six years now, and real wages growth decelerated again from
3.1 percent year-on-year in April to 2.8 percent year-on-year in May.
However, economists warn that these flash estimates tend to be revised.
And despite a surge in completion in the residential sector --- up by
almost 30 percent in the first quarter --- the output in construction
remained almost flat in May at 0.2 percent year-on-year, according to
Alexander Isakov, chief economist at VTB Capital. The stagnation in real
wage growth has been depressing the retail sector, where turnover grew
by 1.4 percent year-on-year in May, up slightly from 1.2 percent
year-on-year in the previous month. "The lacklustre growth reflects
disposable income growth being down 2.3 percent year-on-year in 1Q19
(the last value available). This anemic demand growth is likely to
persist throughout the year, we believe, as long as the 2018 base
effects are at play (higher inflation, no extra-public sector wage
indexations etc.)" said Isakov. [[Real wages are
rising]{.underline}]{.mark}, but too slowly, [[as with economic
growth]{.mark} of only 0.5 percent in the first quarter year-on-year
there is little momentum in the economy. Real wages increased by 2.8
percent year-on-year in May, while growth in April was revised up from
the flash estimate of 1.6 percent year-on-year to 3.1 percent
year-on-year. "We note that personal income tax revenues have been
growing faster than the average nominal wage recently. In April, the
former grew 15.8 percent year-on-year, while the latter added 8.4
percent year-on-year," said Isakov. Construction output]{.underline} ---
one of the three main drivers of economic growth --- remained stagnant
with growth of just 0.2 percent year-on-year in May. The highest growth
registered so far this year has been 0.3 percent year-on-year, in
February. "Nonetheless, the surge in construction-related products might
foreshadow an increase in construction activity," says Isakov.

A number of internal and external challenges threaten to erode its
competitive position as an arms exporter in the future. [[First]{.mark},
in the past [Russian firms have proven weak in]{.mark} the provision of
after-sales [support and guidance]{.mark} to their
customers.]{.underline} This is a lucrative aspect of the arms trade,
and one of immense practical importance to the customer. This is,
though, an area in which Russia has taken steps to improve performance,
with construction under way of a system to enhance after-sales
services.89 [[Second]{.mark}, developments outside Russia might also
threaten its position in the global arms market. If [efforts by China
and India to develop indigenous production]{.mark} capabilities were [to
prove successful]{.mark}, their [need to import]{.mark} Russian
aircraft, missiles, submarines and engines [may
diminish]{.mark}.]{.underline} Both countries -- especially India --
remain behind Russia in key areas. However, [if they are able to produce
viable substitutes for Russian goods in the future, this will result in
[a decline in demand for Russian exports]{.mark} and the [emergence of
potential competitors]{.mark} in third-country markets.]{.underline} For
example, China's progress in the development of advanced fighter
aircraft -- notwithstanding the persistence of its weaknesses in engine
production -- offers the prospect of greater competition for Russia in
markets not traditionally served by Western producers. [[Third]{.mark},
changes in [international relations]{.mark} might [also adversely
affect]{.mark} Russia's [prospects]{.mark} as a leading arms exporter.
Although its [producers might benefit from]{.mark} any [shift]{.mark} in
foreign policy allegiance from traditional US allies [towards Russia, a
shift in the opposite direction]{.mark} by traditional Russian clients
such as India or Vietnam [could knock a significant hole]{.mark} in arms
revenues.]{.underline}

#### Russia arms producers are unpopular and unsustainable

**Stratfor**, **5/2**/19, Stratfor is an American geopolitical
intelligence platform and publisher. \"Russia is one of the world\'s
biggest weapons dealers, but its defense industry is headed for
trouble,\" Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-defense-industry-faces-problems-hurting-military-modernization-2019-5

This is why, for example, [[India\'s withdrawal from]{.mark} the [joint
development]{.mark} and production of the Su-57 fighter aircraft last
year has [cast doubt on Russia\'s ability to sustain the program]{.mark}
in a meaningful way or at an acceptable cost. As a result, [Russia has
sought]{.mark} --- albeit [unsuccessfully]{.mark} so far --- [to
export]{.mark} the Su-57 more widely in an effort to find a partnership
that would make the aircraft viable.]{.underline} Russia, accordingly,
has been considering other solutions to safeguard its defense sector and
improve its overall industrial performance. One possible remedy centers
on what amounts to burden sharing across sectors. In this, the country
is looking to harness the defense industry\'s strengths for civilian
production, similar to the way Western enterprises such as Boeing or
Airbus operate. [By producing non-military products for domestic and
foreign civilian markets, Russian defense manufacturers could sustain
themselves even if their military goods are earning less revenue.
Unfortunately for Russia, the chances that such a gambit will succeed
are low --- even for domestic consumption. Although Moscow has been
pushing an import substitution program amid the West\'s sanctions,
Russian firms continue to privilege foreign, instead of domestic,
components. In 2018, 38% of Russian industrial enterprises purchased
equipment from abroad; two years before, the figure was just 6%.
Ultimately, if Russian arms producers are failing to find sales for
defense customers at home, they\'re unlikely to find any more of a
domestic civilian market for their wares.]{.underline} As a great power,
Russia has lofty ambitions for the modernization of its military.
[[Budget constraints, more competition]{.mark} from elsewhere [and other
issues]{.mark}, however, [mean many]{.mark} of the army\'s most
ostentatious [projects]{.mark} [never make it past the showroom]{.mark}.
And [moving forward, the]{.mark} Russian [defense industry]{.mark}\'s
plight [is unlikely to improve]{.mark} [as it faces a vicious
circle]{.mark} that is leaving it worse for wear.]{.underline}

#### Russia fill in efforts are insufficient

Berlin-based journalist and columnist for Bloomberg View.
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-12/u-s-is-no-1-in-arms-sales-as-russia-loses-market-share

For Russia, the Middle East accounted only for 16 percent of its weapons
exports over the same period, with most going to Egypt and Iraq. Its
major trade partners were India, China and Algeria -- but [sales to
India dropped significantly as its government sought to diversify
suppliers and bought more from the U.S., South Korea and, most painfully
for the Kremlin, Ukraine.]{.underline} Russia has been losing key
aircraft tenders in India to the U.S. This, along with the economic
collapse of another major client, Venezuela, and the current potential
for regime change in Algeria, all makes a rebound in Russian sales look
unlikely. [Arms sales are perhaps the best reflection of a major
military power's international influence.]{.underline} The market isn't
all about price and quality competition; it's about permanent and
situational alliances. [[The growing gap between the U.S. and
Russia]{.mark} in exports [shows]{.mark} that [Putin's forays]{.mark}
into areas such as the Middle East [are failing]{.mark} to translate
into Russian influence in the region. [Although Putin's warm relations
with Egyptian President]{.mark} Abdel-Fattah el-[Sisi and]{.mark} his
alliance with [Iran]{.mark}, which has a lot of influence over Iraq,
[are paying off]{.mark} to some extent, [they **can't**]{.mark} quite
[compensate for ground lost]{.mark} elsewhere.]{.underline} The U.S.'s
allies, France, Germany and the U.K. among them, have been rapidly
increasing their market share, too. That's a rarely mentioned way in
which the security alliance with Washington is paying off for the
Europeans. All the ethical objections to selling arms to countries such
as Saudi Arabia notwithstanding, European Union member states need
markets for their defense industries, which employ about 500,000 people.
Being under the U.S. umbrella opens doors where Russia and China are
less desirable partners -- that is, in most of the world. Many tears
have been shed in the U.S. about the collapse of the American-led global
order. But [[if you take arms sales as]{.mark} a proxy [for influence,
the U.S.'s]{.mark} global [dominance looks to be resilient]{.mark}. In a
more conflict-prone, competitive world, [America is doing]{.mark} rather
[well while]{.mark} its [longstanding geopolitical rivals
stumble]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[It is unlikely that [Russian arms sales]{.mark} will disappear in the
near future, but their [strategic pull is
weakening]{.mark}]{.underline}. Influence and leverage, as arms export
analyst Andrew Pierre notes, are indeed transitory phenomena. [[While
Putin has]{.mark} successfully [integrated arms sales]{.mark} into his
strategy of fostering polycentrism, challenging American hegemony, and
reestablishing Russia's presence globally, [his strategic end
state]{.mark} of returning Russia to its former world power status
[lacks international attractiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[Furthermore, [his focus on short-term political gains]{.mark} in lieu
of a more farsighted plan to achieve his strategic end state [has
handicapped]{.mark} his use of [arms exports]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
fact, [arms sales have merely supported multiple pragmatic
relationships, not an anti-Western coalition, as states seek to maximize
their benefits at the expense of Russia]{.underline}. As Lo observes,
Putin's policy "is frequently held hostage to short-term political and
economic expediency\...and the over-personalization of decision-making."
[Thus, while [Russia's recent dispersal of arms]{.mark} might strengthen
the ability of other states to either reduce the power of the West or
promote regional balancing, it [does not mean]{.mark} that [Russia's
overall strength]{.mark} and influence [rise]{.mark} reciprocally. For
[as long as Putin's strategy remains]{.mark} myopic as he seeks partners
in a quixotic quest to renew Russia's grandeur and global influence,
[states will]{.mark} continue to gain [reverse]{.mark} leverage [on
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recently imprisoned anti-Putin activist
Aleksey Navalny phrased it best in his ominous foreshowing of Putin's
future: This regime is doomed, I've said it and I will repeat it, but of
course, I will not mention specific dates: in the eleventh year I said
that they had a year and a half left, and I will not say anything more.
Doom is obvious, because \[Putin's regime\] is \[a\] feudal power, in
the post-industrial world unthinkable \[sic\]; because it prevents us
from developing, inventing, building, growing, teaching and healing.690
While Navalny's words might err on the dramatic, there is truth within
them. [Although Putin might still view [arms sales]{.mark} as an
important item inside his political toolbox, military exports
[are]{.mark} quickly [becoming]{.mark} a [dull]{.mark} and impractical
instrument [unable to yield]{.mark} the [outcomes]{.mark} that Putin
desires regardless of the previous benefits they once
provided.]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark}'s rapid expansion over the past two decades into Africa,
Latin America and across Asia has relied on its growing economic
resources and has taken the form of heavy investments, funding and
infrastructure projects]{.underline}. Its military exports were largely
bare-bones equipment. [Now, the world's second-largest economy [is fast
positioning itself as]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n attractive [supplier
of]{.mark} relatively affordable [high-tech military hardware to]{.mark}
an increasing number of emerging [economies facing sanctions]{.mark} or
restrictions [from the West]{.mark}. The country's [arms sales to Africa
grew by 55]{.mark} percent between 2012 and 2017 compared to the
previous five-year period, totaling \$273 million in 2017. Of those
sales, [42 percent of exports landed in North Africa]{.mark} --- [a
region]{.mark} long [plagued by U.S.]{.mark} and European [arms
embargoes]{.mark} and a more general reluctance from these suppliers to
do business. Today, 80 percent of trainer jets across Africa are the
Chinese-made K-8 planes, and with advancements in China's aviation
industry, particularly the development of an indigenous jet engine,
Chinese aircraft are becoming more attractive to African customers.
China is now marketing its indigenous, armed unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) to potential buyers in Egypt and Nigeria.]{.underline} Closer to
home, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} in March 2018 [announced a deal to
sell Pakistan a large-scale optical tracking system used to accelerate
the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of
carrying nuclear payloads]{.underline}. It was the first example of
China exporting sensitive technology. [[Pakistan is facing restrictions
from the
U.S.](https://www.ozy.com/opinion/baloch-leader-trump-speaks-a-language-pakistan-can-understand/88951)
on weapons sales because of differences on terrorism and
Afghanistan]{.underline}. State-owned China South Industries Group is
aggressively pitching its mine-clearing laser gun to international
customers such as [[Myanmar]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [already [relies
on China]{.mark} for 68 percent of its weapons [because of]{.mark} E.U.
and [U.S. sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[[Venezuela]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[imports]{.mark} 23 percent of
its weapons [from China]{.mark}]{.underline}, showed off a cache of new
Chinese-built military vehicles at a parade in July 2018. [China is also
pitching a new generation of laser weapons to Venezuela]{.underline}.
These include [the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp.'s LW-30
laser defense system and China Shipbuilding Industry Corp.'s
vehicle-mounted laser weapon]{.underline}, both launched at the Zhuhai
Air Show in November 2018. "The one advantage that African countries,
and for that matter any other country that considers China as an
acceptable arms supplier, will have is that the number of suppliers of
more advanced equipment is increasing, which improves the bargaining
position," says Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms
Transfers and Military Expenditure Programme. Some of China's earliest
successes in selling high-tech military equipment came earlier this
decade, in the Middle East, with drones. The U.S. has strict rules on
who it can sell UAVs to, and several Middle Eastern nations have had
requests to America turned down. So, "China stepped in and offered its
alternatives," says Wezeman. Since 2014, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan and
Iraq have all bought military drones from China. These UAVs have been
deployed in wars against ISIS and in Yemen. But the country's
willingness to sell weapons systems to virtually anyone gives China a
distinct edge in carving out a niche for itself in the global arms
market, and its ability to deliver high-tech machines at cheaper rates
than competitors also attracts potential buyers. China's most advanced
UAV, the CH-5 Rainbow, costs half as much as the \$16.9 million
U.S.-made Reaper. China's base model can be acquired for just \$1
million. Four of China's Type 054A frigates were recently ordered by
Pakistan at a unit cost of \$250 million, compared to a price tag of
\$466 million for the similarly sized French-built La Fayette model.
Speaking to the Global Times newspaper, one of the Chinese Communist
Party's mouthpieces, Beijing-based military analyst Wei Dongxu claimed
in November that the country's new HD-1 supersonic missile, known as an
aircraft carrier killer, would hit the market at a significantly lower
price than existing products. This includes undercutting the \$2.75
million BrahMos missile, developed by Russia and India. The CH-5
Rainbow, China's latest "Killer Drone." None of this would have been
possible, of course, had China not made [significant advances in
developing high-tech military
equipment](https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/chinas-military-civil-fusion-has-washington-worried/90522)
in the first place. One such segment of the market is naval technology,
where China has made rapid strides in large domestic-built craft, such
as corvettes, frigates and submarines. [[Once reliant on Russia]{.mark}
for high-end technology, [China is now developing]{.mark} heavily
customized models of [weapons systems]{.mark} specifically [for]{.mark}

[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} has significantly [escalated its]{.mark}
ballistic [missile programme by buying]{.mark} technology [from
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a US media report.

In a story published on Wednesday, broadcaster CNN said the United
States government had obtained intelligence on the technology transfers,
but the administration of US President Donald Trump did not initially
share its knowledge with key members of Congress.

[Jeff [Stacey, a US national security consultant]{.mark} who worked at
the State Department]{.underline} under former President Barack Obama,
[[told]{.underline}]{.mark} Al Jazeera [[the]{.mark} news [report was
\"significant]{.mark} and alarming\".]{.underline}

\"The key questions is: is this administration, in any way, not just
aware of this, but colluding with this? Are they party to this? How much
information have they actually been given by the Saudis? How much have
they decided to look the other way?\" Stacey said.

Bypassing Congress

The news comes amid strained relations between Congress and the White
House over relations with Saudi Arabia.

A group of US senators is trying to block weapons sales to the kingdom,
along with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, following a bipartisan
outcry over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and
subsequent scrutiny of Saudi Arabia\'s role in the war in Yemen.

Trump bypassed Congress last month to approve \$8bn worth of arms sales
by declaring an emergency over growing tensions with Iran.

[In a statement, [the foreign ministry said China and Saudi Arabia
are]{.mark} \"comprehensive [strategic partners\" and \"maintain]{.mark}
friendly [cooperation]{.mark} in all areas, including [in]{.mark} the
area of [arms sales]{.mark}\".]{.underline}

[\"Such cooperation does not violate any international laws, nor does it
involve the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\" the Chinese
ministry said.]{.underline}

A US State Department official was quoted as saying Washington remains
committed to \"the goal of a Middle East free of weapons of mass
destruction and delivery systems\".

Saudi Arabia hasn\'t commented on the story.

Changing tact?

[The 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime, an informal understanding
among 35 countries, bans Saudi Arabia from buying ballistic missiles
from the US and others. China, however, is not a signatory.]{.underline}

[[The kingdom has been buying Chinese missiles for decades]{.mark},
according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a]{.underline} group that
works with governments on threat reduction. However, it is not known
whether Saudi Arabia has the ability to build its own missiles or deploy
those it has acquired over the years.

[Satellite [imagery]{.mark},]{.underline} originally published by the
Washington Post in January, [[appeared to show a ballistic missile
factory]{.mark} in Al Dawadmi, [west of]{.mark} the Saudi capital,
[Riyadh]{.mark}. Analysts at the time said what was shown in the
[images]{.mark} appeared to [match Chinese
technology.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A new image of the same plant obtained by CNN shows a \"similar level of
activity\" at the site in May.

According to \"two sources familiar with the matter\", while the Senate
Intelligence Committee has now been given access to the Saudi
intelligence, it has not received a specific briefing on the Saudi
technology purchase from China, the report said.

Is China's arms export strategy really a success story? The first
question is to establish whether there has been dramatic growth in
China's arms exports, emulating the success of its broader commercial
exports. While the picture is not equivocal, there are signs that
something is indeed happening. [[Chinese arms sales are
growing]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Across 2012--16, they accounted for 6.2
per cent of the global arms trade, [up by an impressive 74 per
cent]{.mark} compared to 2007--11. In fact, over 2012--16, [China's arms
exports raced ahead]{.mark} of those from Germany, France and the United
Kingdom, [making China the]{.mark} world's [third biggest arms
exporter]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not a short-term aberration, but
a long-term trend. [Between 2000 and 2015, Chinese [arms exports
expanded by a factor of 6.5.]{.mark} In 2016, China shipped US\$2.1
billion in arms, marginally behind France's US\$2.2 billion, but well
ahead of the United Kingdom's US\$1.4 billion.]{.underline} While
China's 2016 market share is well below that of the United States at 33
per cent, the gap is gradually closing with Russia (23 per cent), and
has disappeared altogether with France (6 per cent), Germany (5.6 per
cent) and the United Kingdom (4.6 per cent).

height="6.25e-3in"}[China's arms exports have been criticised for
lacking global appeal since 72 per cent of all exports in the last five
years went to just three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Myanmar.]{.underline} Yet, this criticism is unfair. Such dependence on
a few core customers affects both mature and 'new entrant' arms
exporters alike. [[Report

Russia was the world's second biggest arms exporter across 2012--16 but
relied on just four countries --- India, Vietnam, China and Algeria ---
for 70 per cent of those sales]{.underline}. Likewise, 71 per cent of UK
arms exports go to India, the United States and Saudi Arabia (which
alone accounted for half of all UK sales across 2010--15). (Recommended:

[Detractors](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinas-military-getting-strong-so-why-arent-chinese-weapons-17746)
argue that China's weapons are only attractive to poorer nations because
its older weapons are cheaper. While there is some truth in this
argument, it needs qualification. China has been successful in
diversifying its customer base and now exports arms to 55 countries
worldwide, covering Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
Many of China's clients are indeed developing countries. For example,
two-thirds of the countries situated in the world's poorest continent,
Africa, procure weapon systems from China, and much of it is basic
military equipment. (Recommended: [5 Most Deadly Aircraft

But [times are
changing](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14751798.2017.1310700).
[[Chinese arms are no longer relics]{.mark} from a bygone Soviet
era]{.underline}. The PLA has been replacing old Soviet platforms with
improved 'indigenous' models and is now exporting modernised platforms,
including Type-99 MBTs, J-10 fighters and Yuan-class submarines to
Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan. [[China has]{.mark} also
[adapted]{.mark}, innovated and engaged in systems integration in a
determined bid to move up the technology ladder, developing, for
instance, credible and competitive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
anti-ship cruise missiles. [Raised technological sophistication]{.mark}
combined with relatively low procurement cost [has led to]{.mark}
increasingly [cost-effective]{.mark} arms [exports. Their
attractiveness]{.mark} to more discerning buyers has been [translated
into]{.mark} a sales portfolio in which [25 per cent of]{.mark} China's
[customers are now]{.mark} positioned [in]{.mark} the upper
middle/[higher income country categories, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia
and the U]{.mark}nited [A]{.mark}rab [E]{.mark}mirates.]{.underline} Is
there something different, something special, that distinguishes China's
arms export strategy from its Western counterparts? The answer is a
resounding yes. First and foremost, Western strategists should not be
under any illusion that export revenue is the primary goal. Rather,
Beijing's end-game is longer-term geo-political and strategic influence.
The search for regional and global influence is the critical aim of
Chinese economic diplomacy. It reflects a more narrowly focused aspect
of Beijing's soft power framework, embracing foreign aid, foreign direct
investment, overseas educational programs and, importantly, arms sales.
China's arms export model operates according to a carefully-crafted
strategy based on three principles: promoting the legitimate
self-defence capability of the recipient country; strengthening the
peace, security and stability of that country and region; and
non-interference in its internal affairs. [Report
Advertisement](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-world-should-fear-chinas-military-exports-22494#report-ad)
Beijing's long-standing approach of linking non-interference to arms
sales rests on the view that a customer's political, military and human
rights record lies outside the contractual arrangements. The 'no
questions asked' policy attracts the opprobrium of Western states, but
there is no disputing its effectiveness in selling guns and securing
influence. The policy particularly appeals to second- and third-tier
military states suffering excessive dependence on US or Russian
weaponry. [[Chinese arms offer]{.mark} poorer [states the opportunity to
diversify]{.mark} arms sources, regain a degree of sovereignty over
military capability and reduce strategic vulnerability to arms
embargoes. The Chinese arms export model has several other significant
features. From a Chinese strategic perspective, it leverages strong
client-state relationships and in the process bolsters Beijing's
influence, particularly among neighbouring states. It is no accident
that China's arms sales to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar
indirectly act to contain the potential threat of Asia's other
mega-power, India.]{.underline} Chinese arms are also competitively
packaged. Pricing is low compared to Western models. Chinese drones, for
example,
[reportedly](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/20/chinas-weapons-of-mass-consumption/)
cost 10--20 per cent of the near-equivalent US version. Finally, China
is amenable to technology transfer through defence offset, supporting
client states to indigenise maintenance, repair and overhaul activities
and even produce components. [Report

While it may not yet be the dominant player, [[China's arms export
strategy has proved effective]{.mark} in taking market share from
competitor nations]{.underline}. China has also begun to encroach into
higher income markets, especially where technological sophistication is
not required. There is a long-term strategy at work here, driven by
[diplomatic and geostrategic
objectives](http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2016/02/20/why-has-chinese-foreign-policy-become-more-assertive/),

[[Saudi Arabia, flush with money]{.mark}, nestled in a hostile
environment and saddled with demographic shortcomings, [has long spent
freely to bring in weapons]{.mark} from abroad.]{.underline} And over
the past five years, driven by its intensifying competition with
archrival Iran and a heavy military commitment in the Yemen conflict,
this trend has accelerated. [During the period of 2013-17, the number of
arms systems the Saudi government purchased grew by 255 percent compared
with its acquisitions from 2008-12, ranking it behind only India among
global arms importers, according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute.]{.underline} The Big Picture Middle Eastern
heavyweight Saudi Arabia is the world\'s second-biggest arms importer.
[But [a dependence on foreign sources]{.mark} of weapons [leaves the
kingdom vulnerable]{.mark} to political pressures from the countries
that sell them. [To preserve its independence]{.mark}, while improving
its economic and employment prospects, [the kingdom has increased its
emphasis on developing a]{.mark} robust [domestic defense
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As Saudi Arabia pursues its regional
interests, [it has]{.mark} increasingly [sought to insulate
itself]{.mark} from outside influence. To guard against dependence on
arms imports, which could subject it to political pressure, [it has
worked to build up]{.mark} the [capabilities]{.mark} of its own defense
industry]{.underline}. This shift in philosophy comes as the kingdom\'s
usual arms suppliers increasingly reconsider the extent of their weapons
trade with Riyadh because of mounting casualties from Yemen\'s civil war
and outrage over the apparent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal
Khashoggi. [Besides lessening dependence on foreign weapons sources, a
mature local defense industry could also play a key role in diversifying
the Saudi economy while Riyadh is working to ease its overreliance on
energy exports]{.underline}. If the Saudi defense sector can be
successfully built out, it could provide jobs for a large number of
citizens and help address concerns about growing unemployment. [Building
the Base for a Defense Industry Saudi aspirations for an indigenous
defense industry are certainly ambitious]{.underline}. In its
overarching Saudi Vision 2030 economic strategy, Riyadh wants to produce
locally at least half of the equipment it will need for security and
military use by 2030. [To move toward that goal, when Saudi Arabia
negotiates major arms contracts with trade partners, it increasingly
insists that component manufacturing and final assembly be done in the
kingdom]{.underline}. Riyadh has also overhauled some parts of the
government structure to oversee the growth of its defense industry. For
instance, the General Authority for Military Industries was created in
2017 to coordinate weapons procurement and research and development with
an emphasis on local sourcing. In the same year, Saudi Arabian Military
Industries (SAMI), a state-owned defense company with a focus on
aeronautics, land weapons systems, missiles and defense electronics, all
areas of heavy [Saudi]{.underline} need, was founded. SAMI\'s lofty
[goals include the creation of more than 40,000 direct and 100,000
indirect jobs in the country by 2030, which, by then[, it hopes would
add more than \$3.7 billion]{.mark} to the kingdom\'s annual gross
domestic product, which stood at about \$684 billion in
2017.]{.underline}

Over the last three decades, [[China and Russia have developed

ties]{.underline}. [[Moscow has supported Beijing's military ambitions

transfers have [bolstered]{.mark} China's air defense, anti-ship, and
other [critical capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} in significant ways.
In particular, [they have [enhanced the PLA's capability to threaten
foreign navies and air forces]{.mark} in the waters and airspace near
China]{.underline}. Most recently, the S-400 surface-to-air missile
batteries and Su-35 fighter planes that Russia sold to the PLA could
target drones, jets and ballistic missiles over much of the western
Pacific. Meanwhile, the joint drills and other Sino-Russian military
engagements have allowed the PLA to learn valuable skills from the more
combat-experienced Russian armed forces.

[[The Russian S-400]{.mark} long-range [surface-to-air missile
system]{.mark} has generated much media interest since its deployment
within Russian borders and abroad]{.underline}. It boasts of an
impressive capability against a range of aerial targets including
aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles and has generated
controversial international sales. Reputation notwithstanding, the S-400
has not yet been tested in combat. It has been deployed in Syria whose
borders have been penetrated by aerial incursions, yet it has
purportedly not fired a shot. What this says about the tactical
effectiveness of the weapon system with a reported range of 400 km is
debatable, but its use as an effective strategic weapon system is often
overlooked.

Regardless of its untested combat capability[, [buyers]{.mark} and
potential buyers [include China]{.mark}, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and
Qatar]{.underline}. [The use of the S-400 as an economic warfare tool
cannot be underestimated and is a prime example of Russian Hybrid
Warfare against the United States and its NATO allies]{.underline}.
Before we look at Russia\'s Hybrid Warfare strategy, let\'s examine the
strategic benefits of selling this advanced weapon system.

[The first strategic benefit is obviously the income generated by arms
sales]{.underline}. Russia's economy has suffered through Putin's
mismanagement combined with sanctions implemented due to the invasion of
Crimea, war in Ukraine and U.S. election tampering as well as
significantly reduced oil prices. [The sale of high-tech armaments acts
to diversify the Russian economy away from the reliance on natural
resource exports]{.underline}. These sales will assist Russia in
weathering the negative forces impacting its economy and assist its
expensive military modernization programs.

The second strategic benefit is the prestige and international status
generated by the perception that [[Russia is]{.mark} still [a force to
reckoned with and capable of developing advanced]{.mark} offensive and
defensive [weapon systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Soviet-built
surface-to-air weapon systems were exported across the globe throughout
the Cold War and are ubiquitous, much like the AK-47 assault rifle.
Russia is demonstrating that, although it is no longer a superpower, it
is still able to build sought after weapon systems that could
potentially threaten the advanced aircraft deployed by the United States
and its allies.

[[The]{.mark} third [strategic benefit is]{.mark} the building and
**[strengthening]{.mark} of [ties with]{.mark} countries such as [China
which is currently in partnership with Russia]{.mark} in several
areas**, not to mention its competition with the United States and
ambition to benefit from U.S. isolation, disarray and global retreat**.
[Although Russia and China have had]{.mark} serious [differences in the
past]{.mark} and watch each other with suspicion, the [purchasing of the
S-400]{.mark} weapon system by China [will]{.mark} act to [strengthen
military ties between the two]{.mark} nations as [the sale will require
training]{.mark} of military personnel [and ongoing maintenance]{.mark}
and parts**]{.underline}. The S-400 is a significant economic investment
for any country and will require ongoing cooperation to ensure the
system functions effectively.

[President Donald [Trump\'s attempts to force Russia and China into
political submission]{.mark} through economic restrictions [have helped
to empower budding bonds]{.mark} being forged between the top two U.S.
rivals]{.underline}.

[At a time when the [Trump]{.mark} administration [was waging a]{.mark}
multibillion-dollar [trade war with Beijing and doubling down on
sanctions against Moscow]{.mark}, Chinese President [Xi]{.mark} Jinping
[and]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir [Putin discussed]{.mark} their
[common adversities]{.mark}]{.underline} at a plenary session Friday of
the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. The two leaders
extolled the relationship between their nations, often described by both
sides as being at the highest level in history.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson [Geng Shuang]{.underline} expanded
on this Wednesday at a press conference in Beijing, [telling reporters
that \"the U.S. has been labeling itself as a champion for free trade
and democratic principles in the world economy, but as its competitors
become stronger, the U.S. has imposed various restrictions]{.underline},
including waging a tariff war, which will harm world economy.\"

Geng added that \"Russia will work to gain more room for fair and
democratic trading rules\" and said both Moscow and Beijing \"oppose
unilateralism, protectionism and bullying practices[.\" Together, he
affirmed, [the two have \"agree to further deepen comprehensive
strategic coordination and continue to work
together]{.mark}]{.underline} to build an open world economy, uphold the
multilateral trading system and safeguard the international system.\"

As the 2019 Asia Power Index published last month by the Sydney-based
Lowy Institute revealed, China has continued to gain on the U.S.\'
dominant position in Asia as global economic influence moved from West
to East. The report, a comprehensive study of various measures of
influence and power, awarded China the highest annual improvement of any
of the 25 nations ranked, though it remained a close second to the U.S.
overall.

While Russia\'s own fifth-place score in this particular ranking was
affected by its largely Eurocentric posture, Moscow did manage to
influence the overall outcome by bolstering both economic and military
ties with Beijing. As Herve Lemahieu, director of the Lowy Institute\'s
Asian Power and Diplomacy Program, recently told Newsweek, \"In a sense,
the dynamics within the old Cold War blocs have been reversed.\"

**[\"[Beijing and Moscow have put old antagonisms to
rest]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" Lemahieu said. \"In many ways **[their
bilateral partnership is on a stronger footing than the working
relationships between the United States and many of its
allies]{.underline}**---whether in Europe or in Asia.

\"[Countries that are crucial spokes in the U.S. alliance network have
experienced varying degrees of difficulty in their interactions with the
Trump administration]{.underline},\" he added. \"By contrast, [President
[Putin seems remarkably at ease as the junior partner to President
Xi]{.mark}]{.underline}, within an increasingly Sino-centric order.\"

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[has]{.mark} significantly [increased its domination of]{.mark} global
[weapons sales]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past few years,
[**dramatically [expanding its lead over Russia]{.mark}**, its closest
competitor]{.underline}.

On Monday, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
[([SIPRI) released a]{.mark} new [report]{.mark} on global arms sales,
[revealing that U.S. weapons exports accounted for 36 percent of the
global total]{.mark}]{.underline} between 2014 and 2018. During those
years, **[[the]{.mark} amount of [arms sold]{.mark} globally [by the
U.S. was 75 percent higher than]{.mark} those sold by
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Comparatively, the amount of U.S.
weapons sold in the previous four years, between 2009 and 2013, was only
12 percent higher.

\"[The USA has further solidified its position as the world\'s leading
arms supplier,]{.underline}\" said Aude Fleurant, director of the SIPRI
Arms and Military Expenditure Program, according to Radio Free Europe.

\"\[It\] exported arms to at least 98 countries in the past five years;
these deliveries often included advanced weapons such as combat
aircraft, short-range cruise and ballistic missiles, and large numbers
of guided bombs,\" Fleurant continued.

After the U.S. and Russia, France ranked third, exporting 6.8 percent of
the global total. Germany came in fourth with 6.4 percent, and China
ranked fifth with 5.2 percent. Those five nations combined accounted for
75 percent of the world total.

According to the report, \"more than half\" or 52 percent of U.S.
weapons sales were in the Middle East.

\"[[Weapons from the USA]{.mark}, the United Kingdom and France [are in
high demand in the Gulf region]{.mark}, where conflicts and tensions are
rife]{.underline},\" Pieter D. Wezeman, a senior researcher with the
SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Program, said in the report.
\"Russia, France and Germany dramatically increased their arms sales to
Egypt in the past five years.\"

[[The U.S. issued its latest challenge to Beijing over Taiwan]{.mark} on
Sunday [as Chinese and Russian fleets met]{.mark} for major exercises
off China\'s east coast]{.underline}, an area that has become a tense
flashpoint between Beijing and Washington.

[Two American warships sailed through the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}---the 112-mile-wide body of water separating Taiwan
from mainland China---on Sunday, drawing condemnation from Beijing,
Reuters reported.

Meanwhile, [[Russia and China were building on increasingly warm
relations, with warships]{.mark} from both preparing to take part in
major naval drills]{.underline}.

The U.S. operation---conducted by destroyers USS William P. Lawrence and
USS Stethem---was a so-called \"freedom of navigation\" mission,
designed to keep pressure on Beijing and assert Washington\'s belief
that the waterway constitutes international waters. Similar patrols are
undertaken in the South China Sea, where China has overlapping
territorial claims with several neighbors.

[[Under its \"One China\" policy, Beijing maintains the belief that
Taiwan]{.mark}---]{.underline}independent since 1947---[[must]{.mark}
one day [become part]{.mark} of [a]{.mark} unified [Chinese
state]{.mark}, whether by diplomacy or force. However, U.S. lawmakers
have long maintained support for the Taiwanese
independence,]{.underline} committing to weapons deals and regional
military deployments to protect the island from a takeover.

Commander Clay Doss, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy\'s Seventh Fleet,
said in a statement: \"The ships\' transit through the Taiwan Strait
demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"

But China\'s foreign ministry spokesperson [Geng Shuang
said]{.underline} his nation had expressed its concerns to the U.S.,
having closely monitored the two destroyers\' passage. \"[The Taiwan
issue is the most important and sensitive issue in Sino-U.S.
relations]{.underline},\" he told reporters.

[China has been increasing pressure on Taiwan]{.underline}, with
President Xi Jinping warning earlier this year that Beijing may decide
to invade the island if its leaders took any further steps toward
asserting independence. [Chinese warships and aircraft regularly conduct
patrols close to the island]{.underline}, and in February Taiwanese
President Tsai Ing-wen said the threat against the nation grows more
pressing each day.

**[[While China was condemning the U.S. operation, it was gathering
warships]{.mark} in the northern port of Qingdao for joint exercises
[with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which in recent years has drawn
closer to its neighbor amid expanded naval operations in the Pacific.

### Impact\-\--A2: NATO-Russia War

#### NATO deters any possibility for conflict with Russia

NATO-Russia War?,\" National Interest, Dave Majumdar is the former
Defense Editor of The National Interest.
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/hell-how-many-millions-would-die-nato-russia-war-53857

How would [[a war between Russia and NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
Baltics play out? Chances of a Russian invasion of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia [[appear]{.mark} fairly [remote]{.mark}. Even [the RAND
Corporation]{.mark}, which has been particularly hawkish,
[suggests]{.mark} that [a Russian attack]{.mark} on a NATO member-state
[is low]{.mark} even though the alliance faces a conventional imbalance.
"Our [analysis suggests that NATO's deterrent]{.mark} against a
conventional attack by Russia on a NATO member [is]{.mark} currently
[strong," a recent RAND report states]{.mark}. "While [we assess that a
Russian attack]{.mark} on NATO in the near term **[is highly
unlikely]{.mark}**, it also seems probable that Russia will explore
other avenues to signal its displeasure with ongoing U.S. and NATO
posture enhancements."]{.underline} Other analysts agree that Russia
does not have any desire to invade the Baltic States, all three of which
were once part of the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire before it.
"The Russians do not seem to have any designs on the Baltic countries,"
Olya Oliker, a senior adviser and director of the Russia and Eurasia
Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies told the
National Interest. ["They are, however, increasingly aware that the
United States and many of the other NATO allies think they do. While
they take pains to deny this, they do see strategic advantage in keeping
NATO on edge, and they are certainly not above saber rattling, including
in the Baltic Sea region."]{.underline} Indeed, from the Kremlin's
perspective, there is no reason for Russia to invade those former Soviet
republics. While Russia has since the days of Muscovy has had historical
designs on the Baltics---which were conquered under the Russian Emperor
Peter the Great during the Great Northern War that ran from 1700 to
1721---in order to secure access to the sea, the current leadership in
the Kremlin hopes to build up its facilities in St. Petersburg as a
substitute. "For the past twenty years Russia has been investing
billions of dollars to build new seaports near St. Petersburg, so the
Estonian and Latvian seaports will not be needed any more," Vasily
Kashin, a senior fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and
International Studies at Moscow's Higher School of Economics told the
National Interest. "And except from the seaports, which were necessary
to export Russian commodities, there was never anything really important
in these countries." For the Kremlin, reducing Russia's dependency on
the Baltic Sea ports is a high priority. "Replacing the Baltic States
logistical capabilities with the domestic ones was really an important
priority of the whole Putin presidency," Kashin said. "It does not make
sense to conquer the Baltic States, after all the money was already
spent on alternatives." Moreover, the Kremlin has limited means to
attack the Baltics even if it so chose. [[Most of Moscow's conventional
forces are concentrated elsewhere]{.mark}---it would take time to amass
a force capable of repelling a NATO counterattack.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, the Kremlin does not have the option of leveraging the large
ethnic Russian populations in those Baltic republics. "'Hybrid warfare,'
Crimea- or Donbass-style, however, can hardly be used where it is feared
most: in the Baltic States and Poland," Dmitri Trenin, director of the
Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in his book Should We Fear Russia?
"Moscow's intentions aside, the local Russians' self-identification with
the Russian Federation cannot be compared to that of the Crimeans. Even
though naturalization in Latvia and Estonia was made hard for local
Russians, they are not looking to Moscow for protection and guidance.
Daugavpils is not Donetsk-in-waiting, and Narva is no Lugansk. Poland is
an even more far-fetched case. The Donbass model is not easily
transferable, and employing it on the territory of a NATO member state
denies the Kremlin any rationality whatsoever." [That means that Russia
would have to resort to conventional military means to invade the
Baltics if Moscow were so inclined. But even there, [Russia is not
positioned to take such actions]{.mark}. The Kremlin would have to build
up its forces in the region before launching an invasion, which would
warn NATO of an impending strike.]{.underline} "There is a buildup near
the Ukrainian border. If we want to invade the Baltics, there is need to
relocate forces, potentially warning the enemy," Kashin said.

He believes that the film\'s **[[implausibility lies in Russia being

Leonid Ivashov, president of the Academy of Geopolitical Problems,
supports Sivkov\'s stance: \"The possibility of a mutual nuclear strike
is the film\'s most unrealistic part. Neither Moscow nor Brussels would
want to escalate the situation to such an extent.\"

Moreover, Ivashov pointed out that currently[[, if we were to consider a

It seems [[unlikely that Russia will, in the foreseeable future, achieve
the goal of a fully professional military]{.underline}]{.mark}; for the
next several years, [[Russia will continue to rely largely on conscripts

[its]{.mark} armored [vehicles]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [more modern
equipment]{.mark}]{.underline} by 2020. A [[stagnant economy over the
next several years and flat or declining defense
expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark}, which have just been announced, are
likely to delay this date. Thus, [despite recent improvements in Russian
military capabilities, its [armed forces are not as well trained as some

both the quantity and quality of their military equipment.

#### No NATO/Russia war -- no capability or motives

**Betts 13** -- Richard Betts, Columbia war and peace studies professor,
"The Lost Logic of Deterrence", Foreign Affairs, March/April, ebsco

These continuities with the Cold War would make sense only between
intense adversaries. Washington and Moscow remain in an adversarial
relationship, but not an intense one. If the Cold War is really over,
and the West really won, then continuing implicit deterrence does less
to protect against a negligible threat from Russia than to feed
suspicions that aggravate political friction. In contrast to during the
Cold War, [[it is]{.mark} now [hard to make the case that Russia
is]{.mark} more [a threat to NATO]{.mark} than the reverse]{.underline}.
First, [[the]{.mark} East-West [balance of military
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, which at the height of the Cold War
was favorable to the Warsaw Pact or at best even, [[has]{.mark} not only
[shifted to NATO\'s advantage; it has become **utterly
lopsided**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Russia is]{.mark} now [a lonely
fraction]{.mark} of what the old Warsaw Pact was.]{.underline} It not
only lost its old eastern European allies; those allies are now arrayed
on the other side, as members of NATO. [[By every]{.mark} significant
[measure of power]{.mark} \-- military spending, men under arms,
population, economic strength, control of territory \-- [NATO enjoys
massive advantages over Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. The only capability
that keeps Russia militarily potent is its nuclear arsenal. [[There is
**no plausible way**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [that [Moscow\'s
nuclear weapons could be used for aggression]{.mark}, except as a
backstop for a conventional offensive \-- for which NATO\'s capabilities
are now far greater.]{.underline} [Russia\'s intentions constitute no
more of a threat than its capabilities. [Although Moscow\'s]{.mark}
ruling [elites push distasteful policies, there is **no plausible way**
they could think a military attack on the West would serve their
interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} During the twentieth century, there were
intense territorial conflicts between the two sides and a titanic
struggle between them over whose ideology would dominate the world.
Vladimir [Putin\'s Russia]{.underline} is authoritarian, but unlike the
Soviet Union, it [is not the vanguard of a globe-spanning revolutionary
ideal]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--A2: Russia/US War

#### No escalation -- disagreements remain limited

Fifth, [[there will inevitably be areas of conflict]{.mark} between
Russia and the]{.underline} United States regardless of who is in the
Kremlin. Putin and his entourage can never be happy with having NATO be
Europe\'s most powerful security institution, since Moscow is not a
member and cannot become one. Similarly[, the [Russians will always
object to]{.mark} NATO\'s [missile defense]{.mark} efforts]{.underline}
since they can neither match them nor join them in any meaningful way.
In the case of Iran, Russian officials genuinely perceive less of a
threat from Tehran than do most Americans, and Russia has more to lose
from a cessation of economic ties with Iran \-- as well as from an
Iranian-Western reconciliation. On the other hand, [these
[conflicts]{.mark} can be managed, since they [will]{.mark} likely
**[remain limited and compartmentalized. Russia and the West do not have
fundamentally conflicting]{.mark} vital [interests of the kind
countries]{.mark} would [go to war over]{.mark}.**]{.underline} And as
the Cold War demonstrated, [[nuclear weapons are a]{.mark} great
[pacifier]{.mark} under such conditions.]{.underline} Another novel
development is [that [Russia is]{.mark} much more [integrated into
the]{.mark} international [economy]{.mark} and global society than the
Soviet Union was, and Putin\'s popularity depends heavily on his
economic track record]{.underline}. Beyond that, there are objective
criteria, such as [the smaller size of the Russian population and
economy as well as the [difficulty]{.mark} of [controlling]{.mark}
modern means of social [communication]{.mark}, that [will

#### U.S. first strike would decapitate Russia

**Press 6** (Keir A Lieber., Assistant Professor of Political Science --
University of Notre Dame and Daryl G., Professor of Political Science --
University of Pennsylvania, "The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy", Foreign
Affairs, March / April, Lexis)

Even as the United States\' nuclear forces have grown stronger since the
end of the Cold War, [[Russia\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic
[[nuclear arsenal has]{.mark} sharply
[deteriorated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia has 39 percent fewer
long-range bombers, 58 percent fewer ICBMs, and 80 percent fewer SSBNs
than the Soviet Union fielded during its last days. The true extent of
the Russian arsenal\'s decay, however, is much greater than these cuts
suggest. [[What nuclear forces Russia retains are hardly ready for
use]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia\'s strategic bombers, now located at
only two bases and thus vulnerable to a surprise attack, rarely conduct
training exercises, and their warheads are stored off-base. Over 80
percent of Russia\'s silo-based ICBMs have exceeded their original
service lives, and plans to replace them with new missiles have been
stymied by failed tests and low rates of production. Russia\'s mobile
ICBMs rarely patrol, and although they could fire their missiles from
inside their bases if given sufficient warning of an attack, it appears
unlikely that they would have the time to do so. The third leg of
Russia\'s nuclear triad has weakened the most. Since 2000, Russia\'s
SSBNs have conducted approximately two patrols per year, down from 60 in
1990. (By contrast, the U.S. SSBN patrol rate today is about 40 per
year.) Most of the time, all nine of Russia\'s ballistic missile
submarines are sitting in port, where they make easy targets. Moreover,
submarines require well-trained crews to be effective. Operating a
ballistic missile submarine \-- and silently coordinating its operations
with surface ships and attack submarines to evade an enemy\'s forces --
is not simple. Without frequent patrols, the skills of Russian
submariners, like the submarines themselves, are decaying. Revealingly,
a 2004 test (attended by President Vladimir Putin) of several
submarine-launched ballistic missiles was a total fiasco: all either
failed to launch or veered off course. The fact that there were similar
failures in the summer and fall of 2005 completes this unflattering
picture of Russia\'s nuclear forces. Compounding these problems,
Russia\'s early warning system is a mess. Neither Soviet nor Russian
satellites have ever been capable of reliably detecting missiles
launched from U.S. submarines. (In a recent public statement, a top
Russian general described his country\'s early warning satellite
constellation as \"hopelessly outdated.\") Russian commanders instead
rely on ground-based radar systems to detect incoming warheads from
submarine-launched missiles. But the radar network has a gaping hole in
its coverage that lies to the east of the country, toward the Pacific
Ocean. If U.S. submarines were to fire missiles from areas in the
Pacific, Russian leaders probably would not know of the attack until the
warheads detonated. Russia\'s radar coverage of some areas in the North
Atlantic is also spotty, providing only a few minutes of warning before
the impact of submarine-launched warheads. Moscow could try to reduce
its vulnerability by finding the money to keep its submarines and mobile
missiles dispersed. But that would be only a short-term fix. Russia has
already extended the service life of its aging mobile ICBMs, something
that it cannot do indefinitely, and its efforts to deploy new strategic
weapons continue to flounder. The Russian navy\'s plan to launch a new
class of ballistic missile submarines has fallen far behind schedule. It
is now highly likely that not a single new submarine will be operational
before 2008, and it is likely that none will be deployed until later.
Even as Russia\'s nuclear forces deteriorate, [[the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is
improving its ability]{.underline}]{.mark} to track submarines and
mobile missiles, [further eroding Russian military leaders\'
confidence]{.underline} in Russia\'s nuclear deterrent. (As early as
1998, these leaders publicly expressed doubts about the ability of
Russia\'s ballistic missile submarines to evade U.S. detection.)
Moreover, Moscow has announced plans to reduce its land-based ICBM force
by another 35 percent by 2010; outside experts predict that the actual
cuts will slice 50 to 75 percent off the current force, possibly leaving
Russia with as few as 150 ICBMs by the end of the decade, down from its
1990 level of almost 1,300 missiles. [[The more
Russia\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[arsenal shrinks, the easier it
will become for the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[to carry out a first
strike]{.underline}]{.mark}. To determine how much the nuclear balance
has changed since the Cold War, [[we ran a]{.underline}]{.mark} computer
[[model of a]{.underline}]{.mark} hypothetical [[U.S. attack on
Russia]{.underline}\'s]{.mark} nuclear arsenal using the standard
unclassified formulas that defense analysts have used for decades. We
assigned U.S. nuclear warheads to Russian targets on the basis of two
criteria: the most accurate weapons were aimed at the hardest targets,
and the fastest-arriving weapons at the Russian forces that can react
most quickly. Because Russia is essentially blind to a submarine attack
from the Pacific and would have great difficulty detecting the approach
of low-flying stealthy nuclear-armed cruise missiles, we targeted each
Russian weapon system with at least one submarine-based warhead or
cruise missile. An attack organized in this manner would give Russian
leaders virtually no warning. This simple plan is presumably less
effective than Washington\'s actual strategy, which the U.S. government
has spent decades perfecting. The real U.S. war plan may call for first
targeting Russia\'s command and control, sabotaging Russia\'s radar
stations, or taking other preemptive measures \-- all of which would
make the actual U.S. force far more lethal than our model assumes.
According to our model, such a simplified surprise attack would have a
good chance of destroying every Russian bomber base, submarine, and
ICBM. \[See Footnote #1\] This finding is not based on best-case
assumptions or an unrealistic scenario in which U.S. missiles perform
perfectly and the warheads hit their targets without fail. Rather, we
used standard assumptions to estimate the likely inaccuracy and
unreliability of U.S. weapons systems. Moreover, [[our model
indicates]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[all of Russia\'s strategic nuclear
arsenal would]{.underline} [still be destroyed]{.underline}]{.mark} even
if U.S. weapons were 20 percent less accurate than we assumed, or if
U.S. weapons were only 70 percent reliable, or if Russian ICBM silos
were 50 percent \"harder\" (more reinforced, and hence more resistant to
attack) than we expected. (Of course, the unclassified estimates we used
may understate the capabilities of U.S. forces, making an attack even
more likely to succeed.)

for Russian Insider, specializes in international relations and Russia

Sense, June 10^th^, 2016,
<http://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/06/10/nuclear-war-not-table-because-makes-no-sense.html>

Important personalities in alternative [[news]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
the counter-narrative, have [[spill]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[a lot of
ink]{.underline}]{.mark} recently [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the imminent
[[possibility]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[nuclear
war between the US and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Before considering the issue more closely, it is essential to clarify
certain basic principles on which we should all agree as a premise for
this analysis.

\(a\) Russia will never allow any country to make it a victim of such a
situation as a world war, condemning its citizens to suffer tens of
millions of deaths.

\(b\) The United States does not have the slightest idea of what it
means to lose millions of fellow citizens in an armed conflict. Except
for Pearl Harbour, Americans have never fought or seen the devastation
of a domestic war against a peer competitor.

\(c\) Since the collapse of the USSR, NATO has lost its reason for
existence. If it has continued to fuel the spending spree of the
American military-industrial complex, it is because it has managed to
artfully conjure various bogeymen (intercontinental missiles, imaginary
enemies, "rogue states") over the past 25 years, thanks to the
connivance of the corrupt mainstream media lies and deception.

\(d\) There is no missile shield that is capable of neutralizing with
100% accuracy a nuclear attack (of any kind, that is first strike,
second strike, pre-emptive or response/retaliation). The S-400, Aegis,
S-500, THAAD, and Patriot air-defense systems can all be saturated with
a torrent of decoys to safeguard the nuclear-armed missiles.

Having agreed on the above, then what is the most likely scenario?

[[It is important not to **underestimate**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
obvious and fundamental importance that humanity places on the strategic
balance arising from so-called]{.underline}
"**[[MAD]{.underline}]{.mark}**" ([Mutually Assured
Destruction]{.underline}). According to our trusted analysts, it is
precisely the disturbance of this delicate balance that could lead to
the real threat of war between NATO and Russia.

The question to ask is the following. [Is it really possible to
decisively alter MAD? The short answer is, no]{.underline}. As already
explained in point (d), [[there is **no chance**]{.mark} now, and
probably will not be in the future, where a state can hope [to]{.mark}
carry out a nuclear [attack]{.mark} [without]{.mark} receiving [a
**retaliatory response**]{.mark} from a **nuclear-armed
opponent.**]{.underline}

**[Relax -- it ain't gonna happen.]{.underline}**

Logic then leads us to ask a simple question: What purpose does this
chatter over the supposed nullification of MAD, thanks to the missile
shield in Europe that gives an alleged advantage to Washington, serve?
The Kremlin has vehemently denounced this NATO effort, well aware of the
psychological pressure that this move is meant to place on them. And
this is the only tangible benefit NATO could derive from this, this
psychological pressure of an existential threat hanging over the
Russians. It is yet another infamous attempt by Washington to play with
fire without getting burned.

Observing Moscow's response to this continued aggression is a key issue
in understanding the balance of power between superpowers. Although
seeking to upset the strategic balance of MAD is misguided, NATO's
intention nevertheless remains to invalidate MAD, casting aside
humanity's most important safety guarantee.

A strong response from Moscow has been forthcoming, and this is what has
developed over the last few months in particular: Iskander missiles in
Europe; Russian ships in the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas, all
armed with Kalibr missiles that can carry nuclear warheads; radars able
to identify and track objects from a distance of thousands of miles; and
the S-300/400/500 missile defense systems. It seems clear that Moscow
has manifold possibilities before it as well as the actual ability to
actively disabuse any misguided attempt to alter the balance enshrined
in MAD.

Having established the principle that those [launching a nuclear attack
should expect a symmetrical response]{.underline}, [one wonders for what
reason NATO & Co would want to trigger such a cataclysm. Maybe to save
the dollar from the true economic crisis that threatens to annihilate
American hegemony]{.underline}? [What wealth prospects could the
oligarchs of Wall Street and the City of London ever have once their
main partners]{.underline} (Europeans, Americans, Russians, Chinese)
[are reduced to ashes?]{.underline} [Who would obtain an advantage from
a lethal exchange of nuclear weapons between NATO and
Russia?]{.underline} **[Let's be honest: nobody]{.underline}**. All
those who claim to the contrary have not examined the issue seriously
enough.

[I would like to bring to the attention of the kind reader some issues
that we often take for granted. The real industrial profit for the
military industrial complex, working hand in glove with Wall Street and
London, stems from the preparation for war: spending on research,
development, manufacture, stretching costs, inflating them and extorting
as much money as possible from the government and the American
taxpayers. This is the basic guideline for American military spending
doctrine]{.underline}. [[Do you think]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
Raytheon and [Boeing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would
derive]{.underline}]{.mark} [higher]{.underline}
[[profits]{.underline}]{.mark} [[from a nuclear
exchange]{.underline}]{.mark} [with tens of millions of
deaths[?]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}**, least
of all [because]{.underline} [[those who finance
them]{.underline}]{.mark} (common citizens paying taxes)
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves [[be]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[reduced to [ashes]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

If a **[nuclear exchange is not convenient for anyone]{.underline}**,
and if MAD cannot be altered willy-nilly, then why does NATO continue to
fan the flames, raising the scenario of thermonuclear conflict?

Three main reasons:

1\. To intimidate Russia with the ridiculous hope that Moscow will step
back from the global arena in which it has been playing the leading role
in the last months and years.

2\. The constant state of pre-alert as a harbinger of war for
billion-dollar contracts for the US arms industry.

3\. Placing troops and weapons in distant countries is a way to project
power and at the same time make those nations feel important within the
Atlantic alliance (with the added benefit that these governments will
provide lucrative contracts for the US defense industry)

The second point is the essence of this analysis and continues in the
wake of the previous questions. How does Moscow perceive NATO's
attitude, and what is a possible answer to this continuous aggression?

The answer for Russia is simple: tilt the table and take advantage from
the deterioration of international relations. Sanctions are imposed?
Implement countermeasures that, while painful, are necessary and in the
long term will be positive and decisive. Import and export products
looking towards the east. Encourage local production with reduced
imports. And, especially, decrease the importing and exporting of goods
using the US dollar.

A military doctrine does not differ much from the following basic
principle: develop weapons and tactics to counter the existential
dangers effectively. It is obvious that when Putin recently pointed out
the danger that Romania will face, having decided to accept elements of
the missile shield in their country, he was addressing the issue pointed
out above in (a), which carries a lot of historical weight and
significance.

There are of course two other issues to be addressed:

Many [[analysts]{.underline}]{.mark} [[note]{.underline}]{.mark} [how
[the West has a]{.mark}]{.underline} [really]{.underline}
[[hard]{.underline}]{.mark} [[time]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[Russian
mindset]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in a scenario of existential
crisis.]{.underline} [They are not wrong to say so, but the conclusion
they reach is excessive in my view, especially when they claim that a
Russian preemptive strike on the European missile shield is possible in
order to prevent (what seems to them) an inevitable US nuclear first
strike.]{.underline}

The [[problem with this]{.mark} thesis]{.underline}
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[according
to]{.mark} the [info]{.mark}rmation [at our disposal]{.mark},
[there]{.mark} simply [are **not enough elements to this scenario to
make it probable or even possible**]{.mark}**, especially in relation to
a Russian preemptive strike.**]{.underline} [We observe Russia's
behavior in Libya, Ukraine and now Syria and are left in little doubt
that Moscow's involvement in international affairs has increased
exponentially in recent years.]{.underline} But it is always carried out
in a proportionate way, accompanied by unceasing diplomatic overtures to
Europe and the United States. [The carrot and stick always feature
prominently in Putin's global vision of the foreign affairs for the
Russian Federation.]{.underline}

Realistically, **[[Moscow]{.mark} [is]{.mark} well [aware]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} the military [build-up]{.mark} [on its borders]{.mark} [is
not a]{.mark} significant [threat]{.mark} and [nor is the]{.mark}
missile [shield]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Does this mean that Moscow, or
even Beijing, are happy to be surrounded by the Atlantic Alliance's
bases? Of course not.]{.underline} [But **this does not automatically
mean that the time has come for a final showdown of nuclear
Armageddon.**]{.underline}

[Major analysts of Russians think-tanks have reached the same
conclusions as set out above, namely, nuclear war is not convenient for
anybody, especially NATO.]{.underline} [**The negative effects of such a
conflict would not be limited to Russia**. We must remember that the
best deterrent, along with MAD, is a nuclear arsenal that is intact,
functional, and is ready and deadly. This is exactly the thinking that
the Russians have employed over the last 10 years concerning their
nuclear stockpile, thanks in large part to NATO's
aggressiveness.]{.underline}

In short, the [[beating of the war drums]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the neo conservative and]{.underline}
[[neoliberals]{.underline}]{.mark} [in relation to Russia [is]{.mark}
only [a]{.mark}nother [way to **increase military spending**]{.mark}
[and **fatten their**]{.mark} **own [pockets]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the
same scam is being used when addressing IS, Al Nusra Front/Al-Qaeda as a
national threat). Moscow, however, has an excellent opportunity to
pursue a military doctrine based on modernization, preparation for
conventional and non confrontation with NATO, increasing its zones of
influence in Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, the Caucasus, the
Baltic and Black Seas the, Pacific Ocean, the North Pole and elsewhere.

Of course the danger of an accidental confrontation leading to nuclear
escalation is a possibility that hangs over humanity, but even in this
case, [[it seems]{.underline}]{.mark} difficult if not
[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to imagine that there would not be a
**phone call**]{.mark} between Moscow and Washington]{.underline} **[[to
clarify an accidental situation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and thereby
prevent tens of millions of deaths.]{.underline}

The [engine of the conflicts are **money and power**]{.underline}. [A
nuclear war would lead to the **exact opposite**]{.underline}: [poverty,
famine and a general absence]{.underline} (for the remnant of the
world's population) [of any form of power]{.underline}. A nuclear war
would mean the end of civilization as we know it, would mark the end of
the financial profits, war, industry, energy, banking and other sectors
of the global economy. It would mean the end of all hegemonies, regional
or global.

**[The next time you read alarming news that speaks of an imminent
Armageddon, take a deep breath and ask yourself who would benefit from
such an eventuality? Now you know the answer.]{.underline}**

#### No US/Russia accidental war

**Ryabikhin 9** (Dr. Leonid Ryabikhin, expert of the Russian Science
Committee for Global Security, General (Ret.) Viktor Koltunov, Dr.
Eugene Miasnikov, June 2009, "De-alerting: Decreasing the Operational
Readiness of Strategic Nuclear Forces,"
<http://www.ewi.info/system/files/RyabikhinKoltunovMiasnikov.pdf>)

The issue of the [[possibility of]{.mark} an "[accidental" nuclear
war]{.mark} itself [is hypothetical]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Both states
have]{.underline}]{.mark} developed and
[[implemented]{.underline}]{.mark} constructive [organizational and
technical [measures that]{.mark} practically [exclude launches]{.mark}
resulting [from unauthorized action]{.mark}]{.underline} of personnel or
terrorists. [Nuclear weapons are]{.underline} maintained [under very
strict]{.underline} system of [control that excludes any
accident]{.underline}al or unauthorized [use and guarantees]{.underline}
that these [weapons can only be used provided]{.underline} that there is
an [appropriate authorization]{.underline} by the national leadership.
Besides that it should be mentioned that even the Soviet Union and the
United States had taken important bilateral steps toward decreasing the
risk of accidental nuclear conflict. [[Direct emergency]{.mark}
telephone "[red line" has been established between the White House and
the Kremlin]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1963. In [[1971]{.underline}]{.mark}
the USSR and USA signed [the [Agreement]{.mark} on Measures to Reduce
the Nuclear War Threat.]{.underline} This Agreement
[[established]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[actions of each side in case
of]{.mark} even a hypothetical [accidental]{.mark} missile [launch
and]{.mark} it contains the
[require]{.mark}]{.underline}ment[[s]{.mark}]{.underline} for [[the
owner]{.mark} of the launched missile [to deactivate and eliminate the
missile]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both the Soviet Union and 5 the United
States have developed proper measures to observe the agreed
requirements.

#### [60 years]{.underline} and [hundreds of incidents]{.underline} prove we're right -- accidental war is extremely unlikely

**Quinlan 9** (Sir Michael, Consulting Senior Fellow -- International
Institute for Strategic Studies and Former Permanent Under-Secretary of
State -- UK Ministry of Defense, Thinking About Nuclear Weapons:
Principles, Problems, Prospects, p. 63-69)

Even if initial nuclear use did not quickly end the fighting, [[the
supposition of inexorable momentum]{.mark} in a developing exchange,
with each side [rushing to overreaction]{.mark}]{.underline} amid
confusion and uncertainty, [[is implausible]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
fails to consider what the situation of the decision-makers would really
be. [[Neither side could want escalation]{.mark}. [Both would be
appalled]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}at what was going on. Both would
be [[desperately looking for]{.mark} signs that the other was ready to
call [a halt]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both, given the capacity for evasion
or concealment which drive modern delivery platforms and vehicles can
possess, could have in reserve significant forces invulnerable enough
not to entail use-or-lose pressures. (It may be more open to question,
as noted earlier, whether newer nuclear weapon possessors can be
immediately in that position; but it is within reach of any substantial
state with advanced technological capabilities and attaining it is
certain to be a high priority in the development of forces.) As a
result, neither side can have any predisposition to suppose, in an
ambiguous situation of fearful risk, that the right course when in doubt
is to go on copiously launching weapons. And none of this analysis rests
on any presumption of highly subtle or pre-concerted rationality. [[The
rationality]{.mark} required [is plain]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
argument is reinforced if we consider the possible reasoning of an
aggressor at a more dispassionate level. Any substantial nuclear armoury
can inflict destruction outweighing any possible prize that aggression
could hope to seize. A state attacking the possessor of such an armoury
must therefore be doing so (once given that it cannot count upon
destroying the armoury pre-emptively) on a judgment that the possessor
would be found lacking in the will to use it. If the attacker possessor
used nuclear weapons, whether first or in response to the aggressor's
own first use, this judgment would begin to look dangerously precarious.
There must be at least a substantial probability of the aggressor
leaders' concluding that their initial judgment had been mistaken---that
the risks were after all greater than whatever prize they had been
seeking, and that for their own country's survival they must call off
the aggression. Deterrence planning such as that of NATO was directed in
the first place to preventing the initial misjudgment and in the second,
if it were nevertheless made, to compelling such a reappraisal. The
former aim had to have primacy, because it could not be taken for
granted that the latter was certain to work. But there was no ground for
assuming in advance, for all possible scenarios, that the chance of its
working must be negligible. An aggressor state would itself be at huge
risk if nuclear war developed, as its leaders would know. It may be
argued that a policy which abandons hope of physically defeating the
enemy and simply hopes to get him to desist is pure gamble, a matter of
who blinks first; and that the political and moral nature of most likely
aggressors, almost ex hypothesi, makes them less likely to blink. One
response to this is to ask what is the alternative---it can be only
surrender. But a more hopeful answer lies in the fact that the criticism
is posed in a political vacuum. Real-life conflict would have a
political context. The context which concerned NATO during the Cold War,
for example, was one of defending vital interests against a postulated
aggressor whose own vital interests would not be engaged or would be
less engaged. Certainty is not possible, but a clear asymmetry of vital
interest is a legitimate basis for expecting an asymmetry, credible to
both sides, of resolve in conflict. That places upon statesmen, as page
23 has noted, the key task in deterrence of building up in advance a
clear and shared grasp of where limits lie. That was plainly achieved in
cold-war Europe. If vital interests have been defused in a way that is
clear, and also clearly not overlapping or incompatible with those of
the adversary; a credible basis has been laid for the likelihood of
greater resolve in resistance. It was also sometimes suggested by
critics that whatever might be indicated by theoretical discussion of
political will and interests, the military environment of nuclear
warfare ---particularly difficulties of communication and
control---would drive escalation with overwhelming probability to the
limit. But it is obscure why matters should be regarded as inevitably so
for every possible level and setting of action. Even if the history of
war suggested (as it scarcely does) that military decision-makers are
mostly apt to work on the principle 'When in doubt, lash out', the
nuclear revolution creates an utterly new situation. The pervasive
reality, always plain to both sides during the cold war, is 'if this
goes on to the end, we are all ruined'. Given that inexorable escalation
would mean catastrophe for both, it would be perverse to suppose them
permanently incapable of framing arrangements which avoid it. As page 16
has noted, NATO gave its military commanders no widespread delegated
authority, in peace or war, to launch nuclear weapons without specific
political direction. Many types of weapon moreover had physical
safeguards such as PALS incorporated to reinforce organizational ones.
There were multiple communication and control systems for passing
information, orders, and prohibitions. Such systems could not be totally
guaranteed against disruption if at a fairly intense level at strategic
exchange---which was only one of many possible levels of conflict--- an
adversary judged it to be in his interest to weaken political control.
It was far from clear why he necessarily should so judge. Even then,
however, it remained possible to operate on a general tail-safe
presumption: no authorization, no use. That was the basis on which NATO
operated. If it is feared that the arrangements which a nuclear-weapon
possessor has in place do not meet such standards in some respects, the
logical course is to continue to improve them rather than to assume
escalation to be certain and uncontrollable, with all the enormous
inferences that would have to flow from such an assumption. The
likelihood of escalation can never be 100 per cent, and never zero.
Where between those two extremes it may lie can never be precisely
calculable in advance; and even were it so calculable, it would not be
uniquely fixed---it would stand to vary hugely with circumstances. That
there should be any risk at all of escalation to widespread nuclear war
must be deeply disturbing, and decision-makers would always have to
weigh it most anxiously. But a pair of key truths about it need to be
recognized. The first is that the risk of escalation to large-scale
nuclear war is inescapably present in any significant armed conflict
between nuclear-capable powers, whoever may have started the conflict
and whoever may first have used any particular category of weapon. The
initiator of the conflict will always have physically available to him
options for applying more force if he meets effective resistance. If the
risk of escalation, whatever its degree of probability, is to be
regarded as absolutely unacceptable, the necessary inference is that a
state attacked by a substantial nuclear power must forgo military
resistance. It must surrender, even if it has a nuclear armory of its
own. But the companion truth is that, as page 47 has noted, the risk of
escalation is an inescapable burden also upon the aggressor. The
exploitation of that burden is the crucial route, if conflict does break
out, for managing it to a tolerable outcome---the only route, indeed,
intermediate between surrender and holocaust, and so the necessary basis
for deterrence beforehand. The working nut of plans to exploit
escalation risk most effectively in deterring potential aggression
entails further and complex issues. It is for example plainly desirable,
wherever geography, politics, and available resources so permit without
triggering arms races, to make provisions and dispositions that are
likely to place the onus of making the bigger and more evidently
dangerous steps in escalation upon the aggressor who wishes to maintain
his attack, rather than upon the defender. The customary shorthand fur
this desirable posture used to be 'escalation dominance'.) These issues
are not further discussed here. But addressing them needs to start from
acknowledgement that there are in any event no certainties or absolutes
available, no options guaranteed to be risk-free and cost-free.
Deterrence is not possible without escalation risk; and its presence can
point to no automatic policy conclusion save for those who espouse
outright pacifism and accept its consequences. Accident and
Miscalculation Ensuring the safety and security of nuclear weapons
plainly needs to be taken most seriously. Detailed information is
understandably not published, but such direct evidence as there is
suggests that it always has been so taken in every possessor state, with
the inevitable occasional failures to follow strict procedures dealt
with rigorously. Critics have nevertheless from time to time argued that
the possibility of accident involving nuclear weapons is so substantial
that it must weigh heavily in the entire evaluation of whether
war-prevention structures entailing their existence should be tolerated
at all. Two sorts of scenario are usually in question. The first is that
of a single grave event involving an unintended nuclear explosion---a
technical disaster at a storage site, for example, or the accidental or
unauthorized launch of a delivery system with a live nuclear warhead.
The second is that of some event---perhaps such an explosion or launch,
or some other mishap such as malfunction or misinterpretation of radar
signals or computer systems---initiating a sequence of response and
counter-response that culminated in a nuclear exchange which no one had
truly intended. No event that is physically possible can be said to be
of absolutely zero probability (just as at an opposite extremer it is
absurd to claim, as has been heard from distinguished figures, that
nuclear-weapon use can be guaranteed to happen within some finite future
span despite not having happened for over sixty years.) But human
affairs cannot be managed to the standard of either zero or total
probability. We have to assess levels between those theoretical limits
and weigh the reality and implications against other factors, in
security planning as in everyday life [There have certainly
been]{.underline}, across the decades since 1945, [many known accidents
involving nuclear weapons]{.underline}, from transporters skidding off
roads to bomber aircraft crashing with or accidentally dropping the
weapons they carried (in past days when such carriage was a frequent
feature of readiness arrangements it no longer is). A few of these
accidents may have released into the nearby environment highly toxic
material. [None however has entailed a nuclear detonation.
Some]{.underline} commentators [suggest]{.underline} that [this reflects
bizarrely good fortune]{.underline} amid such massive activity and
deployment over so many years. [A more rational deduction]{.underline}
from the facts of this long experience [would]{.underline} however [be
that the probability of any accident triggering]{.underline} a [nuclear
explosion is]{.underline} [extremely low.]{.underline} It might be
further nested that the mechanisms needed to set of such an explosion
are technically demanding, and that in a large number of ways the past
sixty years have seen extensive improvements in safety arrangements for
both the design and the handling of weapons. It is undoubtedly possible
to see respects in which, after the cold war, some of the factors
bearing upon risk may be new or more adverse; but some are now plainly
less so. The years which the world has come through entirely without
accidental or unauthorized detonation have included early decades in
which knowledge was sketchier, precautions were less developed, and
weapon designs were less ultra-safe than they later became, as well as
substantial periods in which weapon numbers were larger, deployments
immure widespread arid diverse, movements more frequent, and several
aspects of doctrine and readiness arrangements more tense. Similar
considerations apply to the hypothesis of nuclear war being mistakenly
triggered by false alarm. [[Critics]{.mark} again [point
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the fact, as it is understood, of [[numerous
occasions when]{.mark} initial [steps in alert sequences]{.mark} for US
nuclear forces [were embarked]{.mark} upon]{.underline}, or at least
called for, by indicators mistaken or misconstrued. [[In none]{.mark} of
these]{.underline} instances, it is accepted, [[did matters get at all
near]{.mark} to [nuclear launch]{.mark}---[extraordinary good
fortune]{.mark} again, [critics]{.mark} have [suggest]{.mark}ed. [But
the]{.mark}]{.underline} rival and [[more logical inference from
hundreds of events stretching over sixty years of experience presents
itself]{.mark} once more: that [the probability of]{.mark} initial
[misinterpretation leading]{.mark} far [towards]{.mark} mistaken [launch
is remote]{.mark}. Precisely because any nuclear weapon processor
recognizes the vast gravity of any launch, [release sequences have many
steps]{.mark},]{.underline} and [[human decision is repeatedly
interposed]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as capping the sequences[. [To
convey that because a first step was prompted the world]{.mark} somehow
[came close to accidental]{.mark} nuclear [war is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[wild hyperbole]{.underline}**]{.mark}, rather [[like
asserting]{.mark}, [when a tennis champ]{.mark}]{.underline}ion has
[[lost]{.underline}]{.mark} his [[opening service]{.underline}]{.mark}
game, that [[he was nearly beaten in straight sets]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[History]{.underline}]{.mark} anyway [[scarcely offers any]{.mark}
ready [example]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of major war started by accident
even before the nuclear revolution imposed an order-of-magnitude
increase of caution]{.underline}]{.mark}. In was occasion conjectured
that nuclear war might be triggered by the real but accidental or
unauthorized launch of a strategic nuclear-weapon delivery system in the
direction of a potential adversary. [No]{.underline} such
[launch]{.underline} is known to have [occurred in over sixty years.
[The probability]{.mark} of it [is]{.mark} therefore [very
low]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [[even if it did happen,
the]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[hypothesis of it initiating a general
nuclear exchange is far-fetched]{.underline}]{.mark}. It fails to

#### No impact -- accidents will land in the ocean

**Slocombe 9** (Walter, Former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy,
"De-Alerting: Diagnoses, Prescriptions, and Side-Effects", 6-21,
http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf)

Moreover, in recent years, [both [the US]{.mark} and [Russia]{.mark}, as
well as [Britain and China, have modified]{.mark} their [procedures
so]{.mark} that [even if a nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}-armed [[missile
were launched]{.mark}, [it would go not to a "real"
target]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in another country
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} -- at least in the US case - [to **[empty
ocean]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In addition to the basic advantage of
insuring against a nuclear detonation in a populated area, the fact that
a missile launched in error would be on flight path that diverged from a
plausible attacking trajectory should be detectable by either the US or
the Russian warning systems, reducing the possibility of the accident
being perceived as a deliberate attack.
[[De-targeting]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore, [[provides]{.mark} a
[significant protection against]{.mark} technical
[error]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--A2: Russia Econ

#### Arms exports bad for Russia's economy -- largely subsidized, and tax exemptions trades off with overall economic development

**Anthony 98** (Ian Anthony, Director of SIPRI's European Security
Program, He has published numerous books on issues related to arms
control, disarmament and export control, 1998, Accessed July 24, 2019,
SIPRI, "Russia and the Arms Trade",
"<https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/files/books/SIPRI98An/SIPRI98An04.pdf>")

The information available suggests that [Soviet arms exports were far
more profitable to the central state authorities than they were to the
manufacturing enterprises]{.underline}. However, [this appears to be
changing in line with the overall process of economic and political
reform]{.underline}. As government and industry develop and implement
procedures that enable them to work together [[there is evidence that
enterprises]{.underline}]{.mark} (in particular those that can sell
large, complex systems[) [will prefer exports over sales to the Russian
Ministry of Defence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Paradoxically, this]{.mark} fact [is not]{.mark} necessarily [good for
Russian economic prospects]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Some of the
factors]{.underline} which assist Russia in exporting [[arms have a
negative impact on other economic areas]{.underline}]{.mark}. First,
[achieving profits through the distortions created by maintaining [price
controls means that an effective subsidy is paid]{.mark} to
manufacturers [by other parts of Russia's economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Second, the measures taken to give financial relief to manufacturers in
the form of [special [tax exemptions]{.mark} and centrally financed
funds and subsidies [is a barrier to the development of a more]{.mark}
simple and more [enforceable system of financial
regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}.66 Third, because foreign trade is often
denominated in dollars [Russian [producers who depend on exports prefer
a weak rouble]{.mark} which [has a]{.mark} corresponding [impact on the
costs of imports]{.mark}.]{.underline}

66 This is not unique to Russia, although the need for a more effective
system of regulation is probably greater in Russia.

#### Alt Cause - Russian defense industry mostly dependent on oil exports

**Fal'tsman 17** (V. K. Fal'tsman, Institute of Applied Economic
Research of the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public
Administration under the President of the Russian Federation, February
13, 2017, Accessed: July 27, 2019, Studies on Russian Economic
Development, "Dependence of the Russian Defense Industry on Oil Prices:
Conversion",
<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319562096_Dependence_of_the_Russian_defense_industry_on_oil_prices_Conversion>)

Impact of world oil prices on the Russian defense industry. [The oil and
gas industry in the fuel and energy complex and the defense industries
are the two most developed poles of the Russian economy]{.underline}
that determine its state and geopolitical position. At the same time,
oil and gas production is at the raw material pole, while the defense
industry is at the opposite, innovative pole of the Russian economy, as
it is the innovation peak of the manufacturing industry.

The oil and gas and defense industries function quite autonomously.
World oil prices are not directly related to the Russian defense
industry. The [[scale of oil]{.mark} production and
[exports]{.mark}]{.underline}, which depends on export prices,
[indirectly [affects the development of the defense industry
through]{.mark} the financial [flow of revenue to]{.mark} [the state
budget]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The impact of oil prices on the defense industry and Russia's overall
defense can be simplified as follows. [The [export
of]{.mark}]{.underline} hydrocarbons, especially [[oil, is the most
important]{.mark} [source of revenue]{.mark} of the state budget of
Russia]{.underline}. Therefore, the [[collapse]{.mark} of world oil
prices [at the turn of]{.mark} 2014--[2015]{.mark} [led to]{.mark} a
reduction in state budget revenues and]{.underline}, in combination with
the crisis, to the [[sequestration of budget
expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark}. The small increase in oil production
and accumulated financial reserves of the past years, which only
slightly damped this shock of the world market, could not save the
defense industry from the sequestering of defense spending, although
such an attempt was made; i.e., defense spending was classified as
protected items of the state budget.

Compared with the change in oil prices, the dynamics of defense spending
is more inertial. The inertia of defense spending determines the
presence of unfinished production in the defense industries, the
duration of production cycles for aircrafts, tanks, and especially
ships. This inertia is fixed in the contracts of the defense order.

In 2000--2015, the [average [annual export prices for Russian crude oil
dropped]{.mark} twofold]{.underline}, from 96.68 USD per barrel to 55.61
(by 42%) in 2009 and from 94.21 USD per barrel to 50.12 (by 46%) in
2015. Despite this, prices according to Rosstat, defense spending in
current prices continued to increase monotonically, although in 2009,
their growth slowed. In the crisis years, 2014 and 2015, [defense
spending continued to grow at the expense of an increase in their share
in the expenditures of the consolidated budget]{.underline}; other
budget items were cut as a result of the oil shock. [However, in 2017,
[the state was forced to reduce the defense expenses]{.mark} due to a
decrease in revenues from oil exports]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--A2: Hegemony

#### Heg resilient -- geography, tech, innovation, economic power, political cohesiveness, military, strategic depth, infrastructure, commodity production, lack of threats, and low trade exposure

**Stratfor 16** \-\-\-- "The Decline of the Dollar Is Not the Decline of

[**[superpower]{.underline}** [rests on]{.underline} **[several

[[geography]{.mark}, tech]{.underline}nological [prowess, culture of

flexibility]{.underline}]{.mark}, relative [[political cohesiveness and
military dominance]{.underline}. **[While any]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[single [pillar might weaken]{.mark} at one time, [collectively, they

**[[At]{.mark} the [heart]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} U.S.

[major]{.underline} industrial and agricultural
[[commodities]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the exception of petroleum.
[Even then, [it is]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[world\'s

[threats]{.mark} on its immediate borders, [with]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[even [further depth]{.mark}]{.underline}** [supported]{.underline},
for now, [[by]{.mark} its [military]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and aerospace
power. This]{.mark} **geographical productivity** and **external
security**]{.underline} [[allow]{.underline}]{.mark} it to take
[[a]{.mark} hands-off economic approach]{.underline}
**[unmatched]{.underline}** [by most]{.underline} other economies. [Its
[free economic environment]{.mark} cultivates a strong entrepreneurial
culture [and]{.mark} allows venture capital]{.underline} platforms [to
flourish; gives it **[leadership]{.mark} roles [in

**[r]{.underline}**esearch [and]{.underline}
**[d]{.underline}**evelopment [in]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}**
[areas of]{.underline} [tech]{.underline}nology [and academia; enables a
robust financial center; and creates a flexible labor
market]{.underline}. In total, [U.S. [economic power]{.mark}
is]{.underline} **[far from]{.underline}** [just a consequence
of]{.underline} the [dollar\']{.underline}s [hegemony]{.underline} in
global finance [and [makes it a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[magnet]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} capital and
[[investment]{.underline}]{.mark} accumulation.

[A few]{.underline} countries have [replicated aspects of those
strengths]{.underline}, **[but]{.underline}** [no single country has
done so on]{.underline} the [scale of]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. For example, the

[[sits]{.mark} at or [near]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[**[top]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[every category]{.underline}**
[of tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological development, while other
countries can only lead in some areas. On the whole, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[can satisfy]{.mark} most]{.underline} of its [economic [needs, making
it one of]{.mark}]{.underline} the world\'s [[few]{.underline}]{.mark}
heavily industrialized countries [[with]{.underline} **[little trade
exposure]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[This gives]{.mark} it]{.underline}
**[more [resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}** than others [to withstand
downturns in]{.underline} global [trade]{.underline}.

[**[No other country]{.underline}** [can take]{.underline}]{.mark}
[solace in [this]{.mark} fact]{.underline}. Modern [[China]{.mark}
emerged from]{.underline} a [bitter]{.underline} internal [civil
war]{.underline} in the aftermath of Japanese occupation, [compelling it
to]{.underline} overcome its internal tension by employing [a
centralized economic system]{.underline} with strong government
oversight of its corporate structure. The [same is true of
[Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}\'s keiretsu [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} South
[Korea]{.underline}\'s chaebol, both closely linked corporate systems.
[This]{.underline} type of [economy is also prevalent in
[Europe]{.mark}, where]{.underline} a [high]{.underline} level of
[[regulation]{.underline}]{.mark} has **[[quashed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[any [chance]{.mark} of]{.underline} [developing an entrepreneurial tech

#### Heg fails to solve war

**Fettweis, 11 (**Christopher J. Fettweis, Department of Political
Science, Tulane University, 9/26/11, Free Riding or Restraint? Examining
European Grand Strategy, Comparative Strategy, 30:316--332, EBSCO)

It is perhaps worth noting that [[there is no evidence to support
a]{.mark} direct [relationship between]{.mark}]{.underline} the relative
level of [[U.S. activism and international
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, [the limited data we do have
suggest the opposite may be true]{.underline}. During the 1990s, the
United States cut back on its defense spending fairly substantially[. By
1998, the United States was spending \$100 billion less on defense in
real terms than it had in 1990]{.underline}.51 To internationalists,
defense hawks and believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible
"peace dividend" endangered both national and global security. "No
serious analyst of American military capabilities," argued Kristol and
Kagan, "doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet
America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace."52 On the other
hand, [if]{.underline} the pacific [trends were not based upon U.S.
hegemony but]{.underline} [a strengthening norm against interstate war,
one would not have expected an increase in global instability and
violence.]{.underline} The verdict from the past two decades is fairly
plain: [[The world grew more peaceful while the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[cut
its forces. No state]{.mark} seemed to believe that its security was
endangered by a less-capable U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[military]{.underline}, or at least [none [took any action]{.mark} that
would suggest]{.underline} [such a belief]{.underline}. [[No
militaries]{.mark} were [enhanced]{.mark} to address power vacuums,
[no]{.mark} security dilemmas drove insecurity or [arms races]{.mark},
and [no regional balancing]{.mark} occurred once the stabilizing
presence of the U.S. military was diminished]{.underline}. The rest of
the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing
concern, despite the reduction in U.S. capabilities. Most of all, the
United States and its allies were no less safe. The incidence and
magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its
military spending under President Clinton, and kept declining as the
Bush Administration ramped the spending back up. No complex statistical
analysis should be necessary to reach the conclusion that the two are
unrelated. Military spending figures by themselves are insufficient to
disprove a connection between overall U.S. actions and international
stability. Once again, one could presumably argue that spending is not
the only or even the best indication of hegemony, and that it is instead
U.S. foreign political and security commitments that maintain stability.
Since neither was significantly altered during this period, instability
should not have been expected. Alternately, advocates of hegemonic
stability could believe that relative rather than absolute spending is
decisive in bringing peace. Although the United States cut back on its
spending during the 1990s, its relative advantage never wavered.
However, [even if it is true that either U.S. commitments]{.underline}
or relative spending [account for global]{.underline} pacific
[trends]{.underline}, then at the very least stability can evidently be
maintained at drastically lower levels of both. In other words, even if
one can be allowed to argue in the alternative for a moment and suppose
that [there is in fact a level of engagement below which the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cannot drop without increasing
international disorder, a rational grand strategist would still
recommend cutting back on engagement and spending until that level is
determined]{.underline}. [Grand strategic decisions are never
final]{.underline}; continual [adjustments can]{.underline} and must [be
made]{.underline} as time goes on. Basic logic suggests that the United
States ought to spend the minimum amount of its blood and treasure while
seeking the maximum return on its investment. And if the current era of
stability is as stable as many believe it to be, no increase in conflict
would ever occur irrespective of U.S. spending, which would save untold
trillions for an increasingly debt-ridden nation. It is also perhaps
worth noting that if opposite trends had unfolded, if other states had
reacted to news of cuts in U.S. defense spending with more aggressive or
insecure behavior, then internationalists would surely argue that their
expectations had been fulfilled[. If increases in conflict would have
been interpreted as proof of the wisdom of internationalist strategies,
then logical consistency demands that the lack thereof
should]{.underline} at least [pose a problem]{.underline}. As it stands,
[[the only evidence]{.mark} we have [regarding]{.mark} the likely
[systemic reaction to a]{.mark} more [restrained **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [suggests]{.mark} that the current [peaceful trends
are unrelated to]{.mark} U.S. military spending]{.underline}. Evidently
[the rest of the world can operate]{.underline} quite [effectively
without the presence of [a global policeman.]{.mark} Those who think
otherwise base their view on faith alone.]{.underline}

In Ukraine, and in his whistle-stop trip to Hungary, [[Putin]{.mark} is
out to score points for Russia. He [is not]{.mark} out to win friends in
Ukraine or Europe. **Nor is he [out to restore a Russian empire, or
build a]{.mark} new [Moscow-centric geopolitical order. ]{.mark}**[Putin
wants respect]{.mark} for Russia, [not external obligations]{.mark}. He
wants respect in the old-fashioned, hard-power sense of the
word.]{.underline} Other countries should proceed with caution if they
consider trampling on Russia's interests. In the neighborhood, now that
he essentially has the Crimean city of Yalta back in the fold, Putin
wants to turn the clock back seventy years to the old "Yalta agreement"
of 1945. He is pushing for a new division of spheres of influence. [[For
Putin]{.mark}, the contours of [Russia's sphere correspond with
the]{.mark} historic [boundaries of the]{.mark} Russian Empire and the
[USSR]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here, Moscow's priorities override all
others. Russia---as Putin has stressed in numerous speeches----is the
only country in this neighborhood with a unique civilization (rooted in
Russian Orthodoxy and language), a long imperial history, a robust
economy (based on energy and abundant natural resources) and the
capacity to defend its territory and project power abroad. In the
international arena, the United States and China are in the same
category (although Putin is often scathing about the United States), but
few other states have independent standing.

[[Putin is a practitioner of realpolitik]{.mark} in its starkest
form.]{.underline} In his interactions with regional leaders, [[Putin
has laid out his view that]{.mark} all the [states that emerged from the
USSR]{.mark} are appendages of Russia. They [should pay fealty to
Moscow]{.mark}. [Other European countries,]{.mark} including the former
great powers of France, Germany and the UK, **[are satellites of the
United States]{.mark},** grouped under the umbrella of NATO and the
European Union. [The unaligned operate in the shadows of two
blocs]{.mark},]{.underline} as Putin put it once to Georgian leaders.
The only open question for Putin is who gets to decide the final borders
of his new Yalta, Russia or the United States. The future of Ukraine and
the Donbas are one set of decision points. Elsewhere, Russia has
announced it will lift border controls between Russia and Georgia's
separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; and Putin is
questioning other borders in the Soviet Union's old stomping grounds in
the Baltics and Eastern Europe. He is challenging the European Union's
frontiers by appealing to eastern Orthodox countries like Greece and
Cyprus, where politicians and populations feel aggrieved at their
treatment by the austere Protestant powers of northern Europe who set
the tone for European economic reform.

Richard Haass: I believe [[the chance of a world

reflects more than anything else the absence of disputes or goals that

contributing factor in the sense that [[no conceivable dispute among the
major powers would justify any use of nuclear

The cloud hanging over the White House seems to be growing, with

globe at the moment, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [faces
a]{.mark} [**considerably** weaker adversary in
Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The Kremlin spends]{.mark} about [10 percent of what the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [spends on defense]{.mark}]{.underline}
(US\$600 billion). The United States spends more on defense than the
next eight countries combined.

[[Putin slashed military spending]{.mark} a few months ago by 25.5
percent, just as [Trump plans to increase]{.mark} American [defense
spending]{.mark} by more than \$54 billion.]{.underline}

[[Russia's economy pales in comparison to America]{.mark}, Europe, Japan
and China. It has an economy roughly the size of Italy's, but must
provide for a larger population, territory and defense
budget.]{.underline}

It's true that a somewhat weaker power can annoy, pressure or even harm
a stronger power. And while Russia has a huge nuclear arsenal and
impressive cyber capabilities, [[it is seriously outmatched by the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in terms of influence and power]{.mark}.
Obama referred to Russia as "a regional power," and Putin thinks of
America as a "global hegemon." There are important truths in both of
their statements.]{.underline}

Both Putin and his predecessor, the late Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, repeatedly complained about the expansion of NATO into Eastern
Europe, and even into countries formerly part of the Soviet Union -- the
Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Kremlin made its
opposition clear in 2008 when it launched a devastating incursion into
Georgia, a country that hoped to join NATO. In 2014, Russia, Europe and
the United States maneuvered for dominance in Ukraine -- this time
Russia lost. Moscow exacted its revenge by annexing Crimea in March
2014, which only drove Ukraine deeper into the arms of the West.

Putin occasionally overreaches, as he did in Crimea. Yet [[the Russian
president]{.mark} usually [plays his]{.mark} comparatively [weak
hand]{.mark} rather [shrewdly]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Syria, for
example, Putin supports the Bashar al-Assad government, a truly vicious
regime that is prepared to kill hundreds of thousands of its citizens to
hold on to power. Here the United States tried regime change, but Putin
and Iran's backing of Damascus made that impossible. As both the Obama
and Trump administrations struggled to formulate a policy in Syria,
Putin effectively marginalized the United States by forging a common
front with Turkey and Iran.

And while the United States and Russia might disagree about the Syrian
regime, they do have some common ground. Both powers have decided that
the first priority is to combat the Islamic State. Both countries have
found reliable allies against IS in the Syrian Kurds, which my research
suggests is a distinct nation prepared to fight for their autonomy or
independence. Despite Russia's first priority to defend Assad's
government, both the United States and Russia appear at the moment to be
working together with the Syrian Kurds to contain IS, the most immediate
danger to the Middle East and by extension much of the world.

[The crises over Syria, Ukraine and Georgia, as well as
[Russia's]{.mark} blustering [threats]{.mark} against the Baltic
republics, all [are responses of a]{.mark} relatively [vulnerable,
less-than-superpower]{.mark}. [Russians feel threatened]{.mark},
humiliated by the West's military expansion eastward. American troops
regularly exercise in what was once the Soviet Bloc. American rockets
have been placed in the Czech Republic and Poland.]{.underline} Russian
and American planes buzz each other near the Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad.

[Although it is unable to reestablish the kind of dominance in Eastern
Europe that it enjoyed during the Cold War, the Kremlin is determined to
retain an influential position in the part of the world closest to its
borders. What we are watching, in my view, is an uneven struggle between
a real superpower and global hegemon, the United States, and a regional
hegemon, [Russia]{.mark}, that [feels it has been backed into a
corner.]{.mark}]{.underline}

From Venezuela to Syria to Ukraine, Moscow is playing an assertive role
in global affairs. [[Observers often give]{.mark} Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark} the [credit for bringing Russia
"back]{.mark}"]{.underline} as a force to be reckoned with on the
international stage --- [despite his country's acknowledged weakness.
Former U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright expressed a common
view in a recent interview: Putin, she said, "is playing a weak hand
very well internationally."]{.underline}

Yet that analysis betrays a fundamental flaw. Power in global politics
is not dealt from a deck of cards but is a function of state policy.
[[Putin]{.mark} has now been leading his country for almost 20 years. If
anyone [has made Russia's hand weak]{.mark}, it's him.]{.underline}

[[The failure to create a]{.mark} more [dynamic economy]{.mark} is the
root of the problem. Thanks to high energy prices and fiscal caution,
the Kremlin has accrued large reserve funds, but [the economy has
stagnated]{.mark} for a decade.]{.underline} When he returned to the
presidency in 2012, Putin promised 6 percent growth per year, but the
Russian economy is now about the same size as it was in 2008 (\$1.6
trillion), and average real incomes for ordinary Russians have declined
for six years running. (In nominal terms, Russia's economy is smaller
than that of Canada --- or Texas.) [Most [experts predict]{.mark}
economic [growth]{.mark} in Russia [will be less than 2 percent]{.mark}
in the years to come,]{.underline} and few Russians harbor hope that
economic conditions will improve. [Slow economic growth does not
directly threaten Russia's military operations abroad, but [Moscow's
spending on]{.mark} national [defense fell]{.mark} to sixth place in
2018 --- behind the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, India and
France.]{.underline}

[[Policies to generate]{.mark} faster [growth are at Putin's
command]{.mark}. Russia could reduce corruption, increase economic
competition and cut red tape. [Yet doing so would hurt Putin's main
constituencies --- elite cronies]{.mark} who benefit from the status
quo, conservative voters, state bureaucrats, and workers in
import-competing sectors.]{.underline}

[[Putin's foreign policy]{.mark}, too, has led to reactions that have
ultimately [limited Russia's power]{.mark}.]{.underline} My research
shows that the annexation of Crimea brought a four-year surge in support
for Putin within Russia but also removed the largest and most
pro-Russian voting bloc from Ukrainian politics. The landslide victory
of Volodymyr Zelensky in presidential elections in April suggests that
the polarization between Eastern and Western Ukraine that served Russia
well is far less important today. And China will soon replace Russia as
Ukraine's largest single trading partner. To top it off, Moscow's
actions in [[Ukraine]{.mark} have [reinvigorated NATO]{.mark} despite
all the centrifugal forces at work in Europe and led to economic
[sanctions]{.mark} that have further [slowed]{.mark} economic [growth in
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[While Putin is lauded for heightening the chaos of U.S.
politics]{.underline}, there is little evidence that Russia's
multipronged effort influenced voting in 2016. [Elections expert Nate
Silver notes: "If you wrote out a list of the most important factors in
the 2016 election, I'm not sure that Russian social media memes would be
among the top 100. The scale was quite small and there is not much
evidence that they were effective."]{.underline} The deep movers of
political polarization in the United States were in place well before
2016. However one judges the impact of Kremlin-backed efforts in the
2016 election, they have certainly bolstered support for economic
sanctions against Russia.

To be sure, we should recognize Putin's deftness. In Syria, the Kremlin
has kept its ally Bashar al-Assad in power and retained its naval base
with a small number of troops and few casualties. In the Middle East,
the Kremlin has good relations with both Israel and the Palestinians and
with both Saudi Arabia and Iran. Moscow's ties with longtime NATO member
Turkey have never been better, while relations with China have improved.
Putin may even manage to prop up the Maduro regime in Venezuela for a
while. This is an impressive record.

[But in other areas, [Putin's]{.mark} assertive [policies have produced
short-term victories]{.mark} that limit Russian power in the long run.
This trade-off is not lost on the Russian public, which has tired of the
Kremlin's foreign adventures. Surveys show that Russians prioritize
economic development over foreign policy by large margins. In May, they
also expressed less trust in Putin than at any time in the past 13
years.]{.underline}

[Putin can continue to play his weak hand well and abet Russia's
long-term decline or try to strengthen his hand with all the inherent
political risks of altering the status quo at home.]{.underline} My
money is on the former. But before we crown him as a foreign policy
genius, let's remember that his weak hand is largely of his own making.
More importantly, [[by recognizing the self-limiting dynamics of Putin's
foreign policy, we can keep]{.mark} the challenge from [Moscow in proper
perspective.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Russian hegemony is unsustainable -- lack of reform prevents growth -- US will regain hegemony.

Institute, holds a B.A. in Political Science and English at University

"Today I wish to ask the question: '[[Is Vladimir Putin's system of rule
in crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}?'" [[opened]{.mark} Marie [Mendras,
Professor at Sciences Po University]{.mark}]{.underline} and Research
Fellow with the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, at a
March 11, 2013 lecture at the Kennan Institute. Discussing her latest
book, "Russian Politics: The Paradox of a Weak State", Dr. [Mendras
contended that, [in the face of a changing]{.mark} social [landscape,
the current Russian leadership is at a deadlock]{.mark},]{.underline}
reversing Alexis De Tocqueville's axiom about 'bad governments'\* to
claim "that the most dangerous time for Putin's regime is when it is
unable to reform."

Mendras referenced two main factors in [[assessing the sustainability of
Putin]{.mark}'s tenure in the Kremlin: "institutions' capacity and
legitimacy" and the "loyalty of the elites," the latter being
"absolutely crucial to the survival of the current
leadership."]{.underline}

Public institutions, Mendras argued, are the best way to assess the
health of the Russian state, and the measure by which she maintains that
Russia is a weak state if not geopolitically, then certainly in terms of
domestic governance. The already weak Russian institutions of the 1990s
are worse today, according to Mendras, as a result of policy "on the
part of the Putin circles, to weaken further public institutions in
order to develop their own system of rule."

She identified key institutions such as "the opposition" and "universal
suffrage" as institutions indispensable to a rule-of-law state and those
most compromised in Russia today, but went on to state that, even though
it is virtually impossible for the opposition to express itself publicly
and influence politicial and economic decisions, it remains very active
on the Internet. [[The Russian leadership cannot undo the damage done
by]{.mark} the [rigged elections]{.mark} and the resulting protest
movements of 2011-2012.]{.underline}

[It is precisely because they have hollowed out most public
institutions, that [Russia's leaders have no legitimate way of mediating
unrest]{.mark} in (public) society, leading to a "situation that is
stuck on each side." This static and defensive style of leadership,
Mendras asserted, leads to uncertainty among the elite who have given
their loyalty to Putin only in return for his ability to provide
stability and enrichment.]{.underline}

[Mendras cited a growing body of research that shows a new, weaker
public image of [Putin]{.mark} that [is no longer
"sacred]{.mark}."]{.underline} She suggested that elites are in doubt
and questioning how to behave now that their "own vested interests and
perspectives for the future, may be hindered by a regime that cannot
change, and probably can no longer offer the guarantees that it did
until a few years ago."

Mendras posited: "what is happening inside the establishment is
certainly no longer the quiet life of a consensual and happily fed
elite" but acknowledged that it is difficult to know what is really
happening because [no one is willing to openly take risks and propose
real options.]{.underline}

One possible outcome is the appearance of "oligarchic and local
[interests that can no longer be monitored by groups in Moscow or by the
Kremlin,]{.underline}" devolving power to local authorities or
companies. Such unmonitored devolution, with [the Kremlin losing the
ability to project its authority to the provinces, would be the
consequence of the regime degrading institutions in order to cling to
power.]{.underline}

If reform is the only answer to this loss of control and growing social
discontent and uncertainty, [[Mendras doubted that there exists]{.mark}
any political [will]{.mark} at the top [for change]{.mark}]{.underline},
alluding to the modernizing rhetoric of Medvedev's presidency, which did
not produce results. Why, she questioned, would there be change now,
"when the situation is worse for the Putin leadership"?

Predicting [[the outcome of this reluctance to reform 20 years
on]{.underline},]{.mark} Mendras stated that [[Russia]{.mark},
"comparatively speaking, in the world, and even on the Euro-Asian
continent, [**will be weaker than** today]{.mark}". She foresees
economic, political and social fragmentation along with a slow
decline]{.underline} rather than an "implosion" or total failure of the
Russian state.

Marie Mendras concluded that it would be difficult to predict how long
Putin's regime might persist. "Of course, [the regime still has
considerable resources]{.underline}," she stated, "[but political force
and repression has a cost, and that cost of resorting to oppression is
politically, economically, and socially much higher than it was a few
years ago. And I think it is also becoming more costly in foreign policy
and international relations."]{.underline}

#### Russia won't try to counter United States primacy

**Sauer 7** (Tom Lecturer in International Politics -- University of

[[The U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal]{.mark} [is]{.mark},]{.underline} as
Keir Lieber and Daryl Press\'s recent article notes[, [the most powerful
in the world,]{.mark}]{.underline} a situation that is unlikely to
change in the coming
years.[1](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/international_security/v031/31.3lantis.html#FOOT1b) Despite
this gross imbalance, I argue that [[neither Russia nor China is likely
to undertake significant countermeasures to help close this
gap,]{.underline}]{.mark} for three reasons. First, [neither country
feels directly threatened by U.S. nuclear primacy.]{.underline} Second,
[[leaders in Moscow]{.mark} and Beijing [do not believe that the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [will use nuclear weapons]{.mark}
again.]{.underline} Third[[**,** Russia]{.mark} and China [need
only]{.mark} a [minimum deterrent capability]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
the conclusion of this letter, I suggest an alternative explanation for
the United States\' pursuit of nuclear primacy following the end of the
Cold War

With the demise of the Soviet Union, [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[no
longer faces a]{.mark} serious [military challenger]{.mark} or global
hegemonic threat. And [the U.S. military is,]{.mark} by far and away,
[the]{.mark} most [dominant military force]{.mark} on the planet. Russia
comes closest to having the capability to be a military threat to the
United S]{.underline}tates[, but instead of being a threat to Europe, it
now has observer status with NATO (]{.underline}North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) [and, despite having more main battle tanks than the U.S.
Army, is no longer considered a threat]{.underline} to sweep through the
Fulda Gap to occupy Western Europe. [Even [if Russia were to]{.mark}
change course and [adopt a]{.mark} more [hostile position]{.mark}, [it
is not in a position to challenge the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [-- either economically or militarily.
In 2003, [Russia's]{.mark} gross domestic product ([GDP]{.mark}) [was
a]{.mark} little more than [a tenth of U.S. GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}
(\$1.3 trillion vs. \$10.9 trillion). [And although a larger share of
Russia's GDP was for defense expenditures]{.underline} (4.9 percent vs.
3.7 percent), [in absolute terms [the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[outspent Russia by more than
6-to-1.]{.mark} So [Russia would have to devote more than 20 percent
of]{.mark} its [GDP to defense -- which would exceed what the Soviet
Union spent]{.mark} during the height of the Cold War during the 1980s
-- [to equal the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

### Impact\-\--A2: Russia Expansion

#### Reject neg paranoia -- Russia's goals are harmless.

Accessed 11-07-2019)

What Does Russia Want?

As we consider the challenge that Russia poses today, it makes sense to
ask: [[what does Russia want]{.underline}]{.mark}? Let me offer five
suggestions.

[[First, Russia wants to develop its own political]{.mark} and economic
[model, free of criticism]{.mark} from the West]{.underline}. As the
Russians struggled in the 1990s to transform their political
institutions, they welcomed democracy promotion assistance. But, for
many Russians today, [the 1990s experience with democracy evokes bad
memories]{.underline}. They associate democracy not just with chaos and
corruption, but with economic uncertainty and the country's economic
collapse.

Thus, when Putin began to roll back the democratic advances of the
previous decade, he faced little pushback from a population that first
and foremost valued economic security. Relatively few Russians protested
the roll-back, which included eliminating the direct election of
regional governors, sharply reducing the independence of the judicial
and legislative branches, and bringing the major television networks
under Kremlin control.

To be sure, Russians today enjoy more individual liberties than during
Soviet times. But by any objective measure, democracy is significantly
weaker than it was ten years ago. One basic criterion: is the outcome of
elections uncertain? However flawed the 1996 Russian presidential ballot
in which Yeltsin won reelection, there was uncertainty about the
outcome. There was no uncertainty when Putin ran for reelection in 2004,
or when Dmitriy Medvedev, Putin's designated successor, ran for
president this spring.

In the early Putin years, Kremlin pundits spoke of "managed democracy."
More recently, they have talked of "sovereign democracy." Its key
feature appears to be that it is solely up to [Russia to decide its form
of government, without Western interference. The Russians want no
lectures, no advice, no criticism about how they structure their
internal institutions. In their current robust economic circumstances,
they feel they can ignore any lectures, advice or criticism that the
West might offer.]{.underline}

[[Second, Russia wants]{.mark} a sphere of [influence in the]{.mark}
former [Soviet space]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Russia has regained its
strength, it has escalated its expectations regarding its neighbors'
policies and behavior. [[Moscow **does not** seek to recreate the Soviet
Union]{.mark}, but it does seek special deference in the former Soviet
space to what it defines as its vital interests.]{.underline} President
Medvedev recently cited a sphere of influence -- or sphere of
"privileged interests" -- as one of five key principles underlying
Russian foreign policy.

Russia's stance has become most pointedly evident with regard to how it
views the relationships between its neighbors and NATO. Although the
Ukrainian government has sought constructive relations with Moscow in
parallel with its pro-European, pro-Euro Atlantic course, the Russians
insist the Ukrainians make a choice: either NATO and Europe, or good
relations with Moscow. Interestingly, the shrillness of Russian rhetoric
only increased after NATO leaders at the April Bucharest summit failed
to reach consensus on giving Ukraine a NATO membership action plan.

Georgia's expressed desire to join NATO predates Ukraine's. Russia has
over the past eight years applied even more intense pressure on Georgia,
resorting to trade embargos, energy cut-offs, border closings, the
occasional air raid and last month a full-scale military offensive. The
Abkhazian and South Ossetian problems simmered for more than 15 years in
large part because the Kremlin chose not to use its influence to resolve
them; it instead kept the disputes alive as pressure points to exploit
against Georgia.

[[Russia **should have** influence with its neighbors]{.mark}, and they
with Russia.]{.underline} The problem is that Russia sees its sphere of
influence largely in zero-sum terms: Moscow regards steps by Ukraine,
Georgia or other neighbors to draw closer to Europe and the West, or by
Western states or institutions to engage these countries, as a threat to
Russian interests.

[[Third, Russia wants a seat when]{.mark} major European or global
[issues are being decided and to have its views
accommodated.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moscow insists on this regardless of
whether or not it can bring something to the table to facilitate
resolution of the problem.

Russia regularly has a seat when major issues are discussed, but Moscow
has not always been a helpful participant. On how to deal with Kosovo's
desire for independence, Russia rejected the proposal advanced by the
United Nations point-man. In the subsequent EU-U.S.-Russian mediation
attempt, the Russians put forward no new or creative ideas but instead
slavishly backed Serbia's refusal to concede independence.

Long a participant in the Middle East quartet, Moscow's embrace of Hamas
last year did little to facilitate the thorny effort to promote peace
between Israel and the Palestinians. Moscow stands today the most
important player in the effort to persuade Iran to desist from its
effort to acquire nuclear weapons. The Russians certainly do not want a
nuclear-armed Iran. But Russia's broad geopolitical and economic
interests with the Iranians mean that Russian diplomats spend as much
time watering down proposals for UN sanctions against Iran as they do
pressuring Tehran to end its nuclear enrichment effort.

So Russia sits at the table, even if it does not always exercise
influence to promote solutions. Russian leaders assert that no world
problem can be resolved without their participation; simply being there
appears important to Moscow, something seen as part of Russia's due as a
recovered great power.

[[Fourth, Russia does not seek isolation and wants better relations with
Europe and the United States]{.mark}, but on its terms.]{.underline}
Autarky makes little sense for the Kremlin. Integration has spurred
Russian economic growth. Medvedev recognizes this and talks about
integrating fully into the global economy and a greater Europe. [The
Russians would like better relations with the West, but they insist that
that be on Russia's terms. This appears to include recognition of a
Russian sphere of influence in the former Soviet space.]{.underline}

Just two weeks ago, [Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made this point
explicitly. He said the United States and the West must choose between
support for Georgia and good relations with Russia.]{.underline} The
Kremlin feels its energy exports to Europe give it leverage to insist on
its terms. Western Europe receives 20-30 percent of the natural gas that
it uses each year from Russia or from Central Asia via pipelines that
transit Russia. This dependence emboldens the Kremlin.

[[Fifth, Russia wants freedom for its]{.mark} major [economic entities
to take part in global]{.mark} commercial and investment
[markets]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is smart for the Russian economy, as
Russian companies derive significant profits from overseas operations
and access to foreign capital markets. A major goal of Russian foreign
policy is to support the penetration of large companies, such as
Gazprom, into global markets. The Kremlin decries efforts to limit or
scrutinize the activities of Russian companies, for example, European
questions regarding potential Gazprom investments in pipelines or energy
distribution firms. At the same time, the Russian government carefully
scrutinizes and, in some cases, limits or thwarts parallel attempts to
invest in Russia.

#### Russia doesn't want to rule the world -- just its own neighborhood.

Accessed 11-07-2019)

The challenge from Russia is also often viewed in territorial terms:
[[Russia is seen as having an aspiration to restore the Soviet
Union]{.underline}]{.mark}, to unify the Russian-speaking lands, or
simply to establish a sphere of control in its neighbourhood. While
territory does play a role in Russia's agenda, it is important to
understand the extent and nature of the part it plays.

[[Russia **does not** intend to restore the Soviet
Union]{.underline}]{.mark} -- it knows full well that this is simply not
possible. Nor does it seek to unify the Russian-speaking lands. In the
speech where he announced the takeover of Crimea, Putin did refer to the
Russian nation as "one of the biggest, if not the biggest ethnic group
in the world to be divided by borders," thus indeed signalling an
ethnocentric approach to foreign affairs. But this has remained a
one-off case -- he has never returned to this line of reasoning.

[[What Russia]{.mark} truly [wants]{.mark} in terms of territory [is a
sphere of control **in its neighbourhood**]{.mark}]{.underline} --
mainly, [[the six countries that lie between the EU and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and comprise what the EU calls [its Eastern
neighbourhood: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and
Ukraine. [Moscow expects these countries to be sensitive to Moscow's
wishes]{.mark};]{.underline} it wants to have the ability to manage,
arbitrate, and veto their relations with the West, and to prevent the
expansion of Western organisations into that part of the world, based on
the assumption that any Western actions there should have Russia's
approval. [What [Moscow wants to avoid]{.mark} is [the emergence of
direct links]{.mark} and true closeness [between the region's countries
and the West]{.mark}:]{.underline} that is why it bent over backwards in
2013 to prevent the association agreements with the EU from being
signed.

Much of the [[discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} over the past year about
[[responding to]{.mark} Russian moves in [Ukraine has been couched in
terms of]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the need to stop [aggressive
expansionism]{.underline} in its tracks. Hillary [Clinton]{.underline}
has even [invoked the old familiar analogy to [Nazi
expansionism]{.mark}]{.underline} in likening some of the Russian
actions to what Germany was doing in the 1930s. With or without the Nazi
analogy, [a commonly expressed concept is that not acting firmly
enough]{.underline} to stop Russian expansionism in Ukraine [would
invite still further expansion]{.underline}. [[Underlying such]{.mark}
arguments [are]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[certain
[assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [about wider Russian
intentions]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}

useful]{.underline}**. [As long as historical comparisons are being
invoked, [one]{.mark} possibly instructive [comparison is]{.mark}
with]{.underline} an [earlier]{.underline} episode involving application
of [military force by]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline} or the Soviet
Union along its periphery. [This episode provides]{.underline} **[a
[closer]{.mark} correspondence]{.underline}** [than pre-war Nazi
maneuvers]{.underline}, but it is still distant enough to provide some
perspective and a sense of the consequences. [[It is]{.mark} the
Soviet]{.underline} armed [intervention in
[Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}, which occurred 35 years ago as of
this December. [Once Soviet forces entered Afghanistan, a key
question]{.underline} for policy-makers in Jimmy Carter\'s
administration [was the Soviets\' purpose]{.underline} in undertaking
the operation. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance would later summarize in
his memoirs two competing answers to that question. [One view
was]{.underline} that Moscow\'s [motives were]{.underline} primarily
[local]{.underline} and, insofar as they extended beyond Afghanistan,
focused on worries about possible unrest among Muslims in the Central
Asian republics of the USSR. [The other view was that]{.underline} the
Soviets had concluded that the relationship with the United States had
already deteriorated so much that [they should seize the
opportunity]{.underline} not only to quell their Afghan problem but [to
improve their]{.underline} larger strategic [position in]{.underline}
South and Southwest [Asia, moving ever closer to]{.underline} those
[proverbial warm water ports]{.underline} that have traditionally been a
goal of Russian strategists. The different interpretations had
significantly different policy interpretations. An appropriate response
to the latter, more expansive, Soviet strategy would be to slow the
Soviet advance by making Afghanistan even more unstable than it already
was, particularly through assistance to the mujahideen insurgents. But
if the first interpretation were correct, stoking the insurgency would
only prolong the Red Army\'s stay, put more nails in the coffin of
U.S.-Soviet détente, and perhaps lead the Soviets to make other moves
that would start to turn a Soviet threat to Pakistan from a fear into a
reality. [It was [the expansionist interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline}
of Soviet objectives [that implicitly [became]{.mark}]{.underline} the
basis for the [Carter]{.underline} administration\'s
[[policies]{.mark}.]{.underline} It became so without any thorough
analysis by the policy-makers of Moscow\'s motives. Zbigniew Brzezinski,
the national security adviser whose thinking became the chief basis for
the Carter administration\'s policy toward the USSR, did not even think
such analysis was necessary. He later wrote that "the issue was not what
might have been Brezhnev\'s subjective motives in going into Afghanistan
but the objective consequences of a Soviet military presence so much
closer to the Persian Gulf." Thus ensued a U.S. response that included a
broad array of sanctions, withdrawal from the Olympic Games in Moscow in
1980, enunciation of the bellicose-sounding Carter Doctrine about
willingness to use force in the Persian Gulf region, and most
consequentially, increased material aid to the Afghan insurgents.
Despite the significant differences between that situation and what the
West faces today in Ukraine, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[applicable [lessons]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [One is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the importance of [careful consideration]{.mark} of Russian objectives,
**[rather than]{.mark} just making [worst-case
assumptions.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Another]{.mark} lesson [is]{.mark}
the **need for [humility]{.mark}** in]{.underline}
[realizing]{.underline} that our [initial thoughts]{.underline} about
those objectives **[may be wrong]{.underline}**. The
[[Carter]{.underline}]{.mark} administration\'s thoughts and assumptions
about that [[may have been]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}. With the benefit of hindsight, [a good
case can be made]{.underline} today that the [Soviet
[intervention]{.mark} in Afghanistan was not intended to score strategic
gains]{.underline} by moving closer to oil and sea lanes [but instead
[was]{.mark} about [avoiding]{.mark} a substantial
[loss]{.mark}]{.underline} for the Soviets: the overthrow of an existing
Communist government in a country bordering the USSR by an insurgency
that could lead to trouble among Central Asian residents of the USSR
itself. [Another lesson is]{.underline} to [[be wary of how]{.mark}
domestic U.S. [politics]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[push]{.mark}
decision-makers]{.underline} **[[in unhelpful]{.mark}
[directions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [A major pusher of Carter\'s
policies was his]{.underline} [political need to get tough]{.underline},
or to be seen getting tough, [with the Soviets]{.underline}. When Carter
had said in a televised interview shortly after the Soviet intervention
that the intervention had helped to educate him about Soviet goals, his
political opponents jumped all over this comment as supposedly a sign of
naȉveté. Carter\'s political weakness at the time also stemmed from the
near-simultaneous crisis that had begun a few weeks earlier with the
takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. The [constant [hammering]{.mark}
away [by]{.mark}]{.underline} Barack [Obama\'s political
[opponents]{.mark} of the theme [that]{.mark}]{.underline} Mr.
[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} supposedly [[has been]{.mark} too
[weak]{.mark}]{.underline} and insufficiently assertive against U.S.
adversaries [[offers an **obvious parallel**]{.mark} regarding the
potential for political considerations pushing policy into **unhelpful
directions.**]{.underline} Finally there is the importance of taking
fully into account all the consequences, including longer range and more
indirect consequences, of how the United States responds to Russian
moves. A full balance sheet on the results of U.S. aid to the Afghan
insurgency would be complicated and subject to argument, but a major
downside has been contribution to varieties of militant Islamism that
for most of the past 35 years have been more of a worry for the United
States, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, than anything the Russians have
been doing. Some of the violent elements that are principal adversaries
in Afghanistan today are descendants of elements that received U.S. aid
in the 1980s. The Afghan insurgency against the Soviets also continues
to be a major influence, as an inspiration and in other respects,
helping to sustain transnational Islamist terrorism. [[**No one** has a
monopoly of wisdom]{.underline}]{.mark} [on]{.underline} what exactly
are [Russian goals]{.underline} in and around Ukraine today. **[[Maybe
even]{.mark} Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[does not]{.mark}
fully [know]{.mark} what those goals will be, and is in large part
reacting to moves by Ukrainians]{.underline} and by the West. [Applying
the framework of]{.underline} what the [Carter]{.underline}
administration faced [in Afghanistan]{.underline}, however, [**[it is
reasonable]{.mark}** [to characterize]{.mark} the [objectives
**as**]{.mark} **more [local]{.mark} than expansive** in a larger
geopolitical sense]{.underline}. The most explicitly expansionist thing
Putin has done---the annexation of [[Crimea---can be]{.mark} seen as a
**[one-off]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[given]{.mark} the [unusual]{.mark}
historical, demographic, and emotional [circumstances]{.mark} associated
with the peninsula.]{.underline} **[Much of [the
rest]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of Russian policy [has to]{.mark} [do
with]{.mark} the specter of [NATO\'s expansion]{.mark} into
Ukraine]{.underline}. Unfortunately Ukrainian President Poroshenko does
not seem inclined to give that issue a rest.

#### Even if there's expansionism, no impact -- Putin's strategy is self-defeating because of economics, geopolitical barriers and long-term political will

[Since returning]{.underline} to the Russian presidency in 2012 [amid
**stagnant** economic growth and **dropping** poll numbers]{.underline},
Vladimir [Putin has been **grasping for a narrative** that could
legitimize]{.underline} a second decade of [his rule. That
search]{.underline} [explains]{.underline}, in part, why Putin seized on
the crisis in [Ukraine]{.underline}. It has allowed him to present a
bold new vision for Russia, one based on a promise of a national
resurgence, a promise that is hugely appealing for Russians \-- in the
short term, at least. [But in the long term, [Putin's]{.mark}
new]{.underline} national [[story]{.mark} has only [set]{.mark} them
[up]{.mark} for **[disappointment and economic
pain]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For most of the 2000s, [[Putin's]{.mark}
semi-authoritarian model of [politics rested on a]{.mark}]{.underline}
simple [[bargain]{.underline}]{.mark} with Russia's population: [Your
political [freedoms]{.mark} may [shrink]{.mark}, but]{.underline} your
[[incomes]{.mark} will [rise]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was as true for
ordinary Russians as it was, on a dramatically greater scale, for the
oligarchs. Wealth and living standards rose faster during this period
than at any other point in Russia's history. In the first decade of the
twenty-first century, per capita income went from about \$2,000 to more
than \$10,000. Against the background of that growth, most Russians were
willing to tolerate a steady constriction of political accountability
and the growth of a predatory and corrupted bureaucracy.
[[Russia]{.mark}'s economy]{.underline} is still growing, but it **[[is
losing steam]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the years before the global
economic crisis of 2008--9, Russian GDP expanded roughly seven percent
every year. In the years since, that figure has fallen to just 2.5
percent, and [in 2013 the economy grew only 1.3 percent]{.underline} \--
**[its worst mark]{.underline}** [since the 2009
contraction]{.underline} and its slowest positive rate since 1999.
[[Disposable income]{.mark} growth has **[collapsed]{.mark}** to just
1.5 percent]{.underline} a year after growing an average of nearly 15
percent every year between 2004 and 2010, with the exception of the
crisis year of 2009, according to Bloomberg data. [Economists
say]{.underline} that [[improving]{.mark} Russia's economic [growth
would require]{.mark} a range of structural [reforms. **But** Putin,
keen to protect]{.mark}]{.underline} his key political constituencies
\-- [[oligarchs]{.underline}]{.mark} on the one hand [and]{.underline}
Russia's large population of [state-dependent]{.underline}
[workers]{.underline}, bureaucrats, and pensioners on the other \--
[[has avoided]{.mark} major policy [changes.]{.mark} As a result, the
[economy]{.mark} has **[drifted]{.mark} further [into
stagnation]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [It was]{.underline}]{.mark} [thus
[not surprising]{.mark} when [Putin's]{.mark} approval [ratings
**slumped**]{.mark} to]{.underline} 61 percent late last year \-- an
enviable mark for most Western politicians these days, but for Putin,
[his poorest showing in 14 years]{.underline}. [In response, the
president has abandoned economic justifications for his
rule]{.underline} and adopted reactionary conservatism. He has embraced
the Eurasian notion of a morally exceptional and culturally distinct
Russia besieged by Western immorality and materialism. State-owned media
have taken up increasingly xenophobic and, in particular, homophobic
themes over the past year, and independent media have come under intense
pressure. [After a brief, tightly controlled]{.underline} [experiment
with allowing]{.underline} the emergence of a true political
[opposition, the Kremlin]{.underline} has again [closed the
gates]{.underline} on democratization. [The conservative resurgence has
been designed chiefly to suppress the question of Putin's legitimacy,
**rather than answer it**. Putin has now hit on a fresh
narrative]{.underline} to justify his presidency. In his combative
speech last week in defense of Crimea's annexation, he defined the
overthrow of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych as an act of
[aggression]{.underline} by the West against Russia. He went on to say
that Russia was finally prepared to push back against decades, if not
centuries, of Western hostility. He outlined a new foreign policy
doctrine with an expansive definition of Russian interests. Moscow would
now treat the welfare of ethnic Russians outside of Russia as more
important than international law, bilateral relations with its
neighbors, and rapprochement with the West. It is a vigorously
revanchist message framed in terms of popular will and historical
grievances. "If you compress a spring all the way to its limit," Putin
threatened, "it will spring back hard." [[Putinism]{.mark} is no longer
underpinned by the promise of economic growth but by the vision
of]{.underline} a resurgent Russian [empire]{.underline}. [This has
[played]{.mark} very [well]{.mark} with the Russian public,]{.underline}
which overwhelmingly supported the annexation of Crimea, even at the
cost of Russia's relations with the West. The percentage of Russians who
think of Russia as "a great power" is higher than ever at 63 percent,
whereas opinions of the European Union and the United States are at
post-Soviet lows \-- 56 percent of Russians view the United States
negatively, and 41 percent say the same of the European Union. Even
before the Crimea speech, Putin's approval ratings had shot up to a
three-year high of 72 percent, according to the independent Levada
Center in Moscow. Since then, they have risen to 80 percent, the
president's highest rating in four years. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[Putin [has]{.mark} embarked on a **[risky]{.mark}, even
[self-defeating,]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[His
vision]{.underline}]{.mark} of a Russia actively advancing its interests
against a hostile West [[will require constant]{.mark} reinforcement
through]{.underline} fresh [shows of [force]{.mark}]{.underline},
defiance, and even territorial conquest. [[The trouble is]{.mark} that
[Russia's]{.mark} actual [room]{.mark} for maneuver [is
**limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}, both [[geopolitically and
economically]{.mark}.]{.underline} In pursuing a neo-imperial idea,
[[Putin runs the risk]{.mark} [of]{.mark} raising [expectations that
cannot]{.mark} easily [be met, while incurring economic damage]{.mark}
that cannot easily be repaired.]{.underline}

#### No expansionism -- potential Russian targets are super limited

[The [formal]{.mark} component of]{.underline} Russia's new [[empire was
supposed to be]{.mark} the **[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}urasian
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ustoms **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion,
which Putin had envisioned as the centerpiece of a Eurasian political
bloc set to launch in 2015. The customs union already includes a wary
Kazakhstan and Belarus. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Putin's vision
has suffered a **severe setback** now that [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}
\-- Russia's largest regional trade partner and the second-largest
economy and population in the former Soviet Union \-- has [[opted for
Europe]{.mark}an political and economic structures.]{.underline} [It is
difficult to imagine]{.underline} [any future Ukrainian government
folding itself]{.underline} [back]{.underline} into Moscow's embrace.
[[There are]{.mark} also **[severe constraints]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[on Putin's plan to use]{.mark} Russian]{.underline} or Russophone
[[populations]{.mark} abroad as an instrument of]{.underline} [empire.
Russia has already backed]{.underline} the [separatist
enclaves]{.underline} of Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia, [but
these small]{.underline} [[territories have **not contributed**]{.mark}
**much** to Putin's imperial project]{.underline}; they are not as
culturally important to Russia as Crimea. Russia's remaining diaspora
populations are heavily concentrated in Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and
eastern Ukraine, while Belarus has a high percentage of Russian
speakers. [[In the Baltics, Moscow's room]{.mark} for maneuver
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**limited** by]{.mark} these countries'
[membership in]{.mark} the European Union and
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moscow recently raised the issue of language
rights in eastern Estonia, where Russians comprise more than 70 percent
of the population in the border region of Ida-Viru. But [even if Russia
were able [to stir up]{.mark} secessionist sentiment]{.underline} \--
**[which [is surely harder]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in a]{.mark}
relatively [prosperous]{.mark} EU member [state]{.mark}
than]{.underline} it is [in a politically and financially shattered
Ukraine]{.underline} \-- direct [intervention would risk]{.underline}
[military conflict with the]{.underline} world's [largest military
alliance. **[Putin may act tough, but]{.mark} the prospect of a [war
with NATO is]{.mark} likely [enough to scare him off. ]{.mark}**[In
Kazakhstan and Belarus]{.mark}, playing [the]{.mark} ethnic [Russian
card would]{.mark} **needlessly [antagonize]{.mark}** [Russia's
largest]{.mark} dependable [allies]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region.
As Andrew Wilson of the European Council on Foreign Relations recently
argued in Foreign Affairs, [[the]{.mark} mere
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline} of a Russian intervention to protect
Russian speakers abroad **[[has already driven a
wedge]{.underline}]{.mark}** [between Moscow and Minsk. Astana may have
similar concerns. Moreover, [Kazakhstan's]{.mark} deepening [ties with
China]{.mark}]{.underline} **[surely [limit]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[Russia's willingness to destabilize the country in]{.underline} the
name of [Russian [expansionism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That leaves
eastern Ukraine]{.underline}. Russian troops are currently massed across
the border, and any outburst of serious violence between pro-Kiev and
pro-Moscow groups \-- stoked deliberately by Moscow or resulting from a
local miscalculation \-- would virtually assure a Russian incursion.
**[But]{.underline}** [even [eastern]{.mark} [Ukraine
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not]{.mark} an obvious or [easy]{.mark}
prize** for Putin. The [percentage of]{.mark} ethnic [Russians
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [their [appetite for
annexation]{.mark}]{.underline} by Russia [[are]{.mark}
both]{.underline} **[considerably [lower]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the
eastern and southern provinces of Ukraine [than they are in
Crimea]{.underline}. In addition, [any such [incursion would
meet]{.mark}]{.underline} at least some [[resistance]{.mark} from the
Ukrainian military and nationalist paramilitaries. Russian state media
would surely present a Russian invasion as a necessary
mission]{.underline} to protect the rights of ethnic Russians under
threat from Ukrainian "fascists." **[But any serious, prolonged
[bloodshed]{.mark} in eastern Ukraine [would have serious costs for
Putin.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Economic decline, effective institutions and damaging sanctions

[[Russia has]{.mark} **very [few]{.mark} geopolitical [options]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} realizing its vision of an [imperial
resurgence]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At the same time,
[any]{.mark}]{.underline} [[attempt]{.underline}]{.mark} to pursue a
more pugnacious and assertive foreign policy [[would carry **high**
]{.mark}**economic [costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [to which Russia is
**increasingly vulnerable.**]{.underline} To be fair, Russia's economy
is not yet on the edge of crisis. Moscow has nearly \$500 billion in
foreign currency reserves, exceptionally low sovereign debt, and
continues to benefit from relatively high oil prices. But
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[suffers]{.mark} from many [economic
vulnerabilities]{.mark}, [including low]{.mark} levels of
[investment]{.mark}, increasing [capital flight, and]{.mark} an
overwhelming [dependence on energy]{.mark} exports, which are [less
profitable]{.mark} [than ever]{.mark}. To be sure, [Putin's
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} toward Ukraine [[extends
beyond]{.underline}]{.mark} mere [economic [calculations,
**but**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[he has to take into
account]{.underline}]{.mark} [that any [further]{.mark}
incursions]{.underline} into the country [will likely
trigger]{.underline} so-called [level-three
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} from the West, [which would target broad
sectors of the Russian economy]{.underline}. Although no Western
government is willing to sanction the Russian oil industry \-- which
puts seven million barrels per day on the global market \-- [some
might]{.underline} be willing to [put]{.underline} ~~crippling~~
[curbs]{.underline} [on the Russian financial or mining sectors.
Russia's economy will already struggle]{.underline} to grow this year in
any event. [[Further]{.mark} sanctions and sustained capital [flight
would lead to]{.mark} **economic [contraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Lastly, [Putin must keep in mind]{.underline} that [imperial [expansion
is **expensive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Initial
[[estimates]{.underline}]{.mark} by Russian officials [[put the
cost]{.mark} of investment and subsidies [in Crimea at several
billion]{.mark} dollars **[annually]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the next
several years. [That may not sound like much for a \$2 trillion economy,
but [growing fiscal pressures]{.mark} have [already forced]{.mark} the
Russian [government to cut]{.mark} federal [allocations]{.mark} to
regional budgets]{.underline} **[for the past two years]{.underline}**.
[[Even]{.mark} tiny South [Ossetia]{.mark}]{.underline}, for its part,
[has [complained]{.mark}]{.underline} that promises of Russian financial
largesse after the Russia-Georgia War have failed to materialize. [[The
financial drain]{.underline}]{.mark} [of,]{.underline} say, [supporting
a separatist government]{.underline} in eastern Ukraine \-- **[[were it
even possible]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- [[would be substantially
higher]{.underline}]{.mark}. In his response to the Ukraine crisis,
[Putin has indeed crafted a new narrative]{.underline} to legitimize his
power. [For Russians]{.underline} tired of perceived slights and
betrayals by the West, [it is]{.underline} a [seductive]{.underline}
one. **[But [the narrative is fundamentally]{.mark}
[unrealistic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [A country with an ailing economy
cannot afford dreams of revanchist grandeur]{.underline}. Russians seem
not yet to have realized this fact. Hopefully, Putin soon will

#### We're massively increasing spending for deterrence

**Emmott 2016** - Robin, Reuters Staff, February 5, \"Armed with new
U.S. money, NATO to strengthen Russia deterrence\",
<http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-russia-idUSKCN0VE1QA>

[[Backed by an increase in U.S. military spending, NATO is
planning]{.mark} its biggest [build-up]{.mark}]{.underline} in eastern
Europe [since the Cold War [to deter Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} but
will reject Polish demands for permanent bases. Worried since Russia\'s
seizure of Crimea that Moscow could rapidly invade Poland or the Baltic
states, [the Western military alliance wants to bolster
defenses]{.underline} on its eastern flank without provoking the Kremlin
by stationing large forces permanently. NATO defense ministers will next
week begin outlining plans for a complex web of small eastern outposts,
forces on rotation, regular war games and warehoused equipment ready for
a rapid response force. [[That force includes]{.mark} air, maritime and
special operations [units of up to 40,000]{.mark}]{.underline}
personnel. The allies are also expected to offer Moscow a renewed
dialogue in the NATO-Russia Council, which has not met since 2014, about
improved military transparency to avoid surprise events and
misunderstandings, a senior NATO diplomat said. [[U.S. plans for a
four-fold increase in military spending in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}
to \$3.4 billion in 2017 are central to the strategy, which has been
shaped in response to Russia\'s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in
2014. The plans are welcomed by NATO whose chief, Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg, says it will mean \"more troops in the eastern part of the
alliance \... the pre-positioning of equipment, tanks, armored vehicles
\... more exercises and more investment in infrastructure.\" [[Such
moves will reinforce the message]{.underline}]{.mark} from U.S.
President Barack Obama, in a speech he delivered in Estonia in 2014,
[[that NATO will help ensure the independence of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the three [[Baltic states]{.underline}]{.mark}, which for decades were
part of the Soviet Union. Lithuanian Defense Minister Juozas Olekas
openly described Russia as a threat in comments to Reuters last June,
but many European countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
are wary of upsetting the continent\'s biggest energy supplier. With
such concerns paramount, diplomats and officials say NATO will not back
requests for permanent bases by Poland, which has a history of fraught
relations with Russia. \"I am a great proponent of strong deterrents and
to improve our resilience, but I do think that the best way to do it is
to do it on a rotational basis,\" Dutch Defense Minister Jeanine
Hennis-Plasschaert told Reuters.

#### And we're advancing our nuclear arms and other weapons

**AP 2015** - November 8, \"US updating nuclear arsenal to deter
'Russian aggression'\",
<http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-updating-nuclear-arsenal-to-deter-russian-aggression/>

[[The United States is adapting]{.mark} its "operational posture" [to
counter Russian aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}, Defense Secretary
Ashton Carter said Saturday. Carter on Saturday accused Russia of
endangering world order, citing its incursions in Ukraine and loose talk
about nuclear weapons, and said [[the]{.mark} [U.S. defense
establishment is searching for creative ways to deter Russian
aggressive]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and protect US allies[. "[We
are adapting]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[operational posture and
contingency plans]{.underline} as]{.mark} we --- on our own and with
allies --- work [to deter Russia's aggression]{.underline}, and to help
reduce the vulnerability of allies and partners," Carter told a defense
forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. Carter
said [[the United States was modernizing]{.mark} its [nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}, [investing in new technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}
such as drones and a new long-range bomber, as well as lasers, an
electromagnetic railgun [[and]{.mark} new [systems for electronic
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}. The defense chief hinted at additional new
weapons that would be "surprising ones I really can't describe here."
Additionally, "we're updating and advancing our operational plans for
deterrence and defense given Russia's changed behavior," Carter said.
Carter also expressed concern about China's expanding influence and
growing military might. But he reserved his stronger words for Russia.
Carter said Russia is undertaking "challenging activities" at sea, in
the air, in space and in cyberspace. "Most disturbing, Moscow's nuclear
saber-rattling raises questions about Russian leaders' commitment to
strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear
weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution nuclear-age
leaders showed with regard to the brandishing of nuclear weapons," he
said. His remarks were perhaps the strongest he has expressed about
America's former Cold War foe. "We do not seek a cold, let alone a hot,
war with Russia," he said. "We do not seek to make Russia an enemy. But
make no mistake; [the United States will defend our
interests]{.underline}, our allies, the principled international order,
and the positive future it affords us all."

[[Putin's recent article]{.underline}]{.mark}, "Russia and the Changing
World," held few surprises in terms of foreign policy, but
[[offered]{.mark} some [insight into Putin's
worldview]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Putin describes an international
arena]{.mark} that is dangerous and unpredictable and argues that Russia
should be concerned with keeping itself safe. Thus, [Russia does not
have expansionist intentions]{.mark}, [but rather is concerned with
keeping itself insulated from]{.mark} outside
[turbulences]{.mark}]{.underline}. Putin also addressed the threat posed
to Russia's stability by what he calls "illegal soft power." Putin does
not oppose the operation of official Western NGOs (such as the National
Endowment for Democracy) in Russia, but rather the practice of funneling
money into local organizations. Putin believes this will inevitably
corrupt those institutions' agendas and turn them into agents of foreign
powers. [While Putin used similar anti-American rhetoric in his Munich
speech in 2007, [the current approach has a]{.mark} different and a more
[defensive tone]{.mark}. Putin in 2007 was frustrated with the West for
failing to build an equal relationship with Russia; in 2012 Putin is
frustrated that the West has proved incapable of solving threats to
global stability. [Putin's]{.mark} current [emphasis is]{.mark} thus [on
protecting Russia]{.mark} from the resulting global
instability]{.underline}. What must Russia do to deal with this changing
environment? [Putin's first article, published in January in Izvestiya,
laid out one starting point: moving beyond the "post-Soviet
agenda."]{.underline} In the first twenty years of
[Russia's]{.underline} post-Soviet existence, its [leaders have been
preoccupied with returning Russia to the position of global power and
influence held by the Soviet Union. It is encouraging that Putin has
recognized a need to move beyond these ambitions]{.underline} and to
focus instead on how to adapt to a more unpredictable world. [[There
have been major changes in]{.mark} Russian [foreign policy since
the]{.mark} 2008 [war with Georgia]{.mark}, [which was a watershed
moment]{.mark} and a psychological victory [for Russia]{.mark} since it
signaled the end of a geopolitical retreat]{.underline} and demonstrated
to the U.S. where Russia's red line really lies. [Because of the
Georgian war, [Russia now sees no]{.mark} major [reason to encroach any
further upon its near abroad]{.mark}]{.underline}. [When President
[Medvedev referred to]{.mark} the former Soviet space as
[Russia's]{.mark} "[sphere of privileged interests]{.mark},"
[this]{.mark} actually [served as an admission that,]{.mark} unlike
during Soviet times, [Moscow's interests were]{.mark} now [limited to a
regional arena]{.mark}, rather than the global one]{.underline}. [[Even
within Russia's]{.mark} privileged [zone]{.mark}, [Moscow's policy has
not become]{.mark} more [aggressive]{.mark}. Instead, Russia withheld
from intervening in the 2010 inter-ethnic clashes in
Kyrgyzstan]{.underline}, whereas several years ago it would have felt
compelled to act. Moreover, [Putin no longer refers to the Cold War with
the same frequency as he used to, marking a departure from old
perspectives]{.underline}. This has also changed the dynamics of
U.S.-Russia relations. Ideological differences can no longer be used as
an excuse for non-cooperation. Instead, we are now witnessing a
misunderstanding derived from fundamentally different worldviews. Putin
expressed a disappointment with the West and particularly with the U.S.
in how it has implemented its vision of democratization in countries
across the globe; Putin doesn't believe that intervention to such ends
can be successful and does not approve of the West's efforts to do so.
Putin also has a fundamental difference with the West and other
countries on purely conceptual terms; Putin believes in classical
principles of international relations, with sovereign states as the
subjects of international relations and fundamental building blocks of
global society. In Putin's view, the West's use of normative rhetoric
and appeals to values are simply covers for the pursuit of national
interests in specific contexts. Furthermore, [Putin still believes that
Russia should remain a global power, one that does not necessarily need
to expand but needs instead to secure its interests in a particular part
of the world without engaging or interfering in the affairs of others.
[Putin is seeking to secure the status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}, and in
this way he is making Russia the guarantor of a certain set of the
principles of balance of power and strategic independence. In order to
defend these principles, Russia can only rely on its own, independent
strength. Putin has also tried to identify partners, such as India and
China, who share a similar view of international politics.

#### Russia is dead -- no influence or power in Asia

**Blank, 12** (Professor Strategic Studies at US Army War College, '12
(Stephen, Spring, "The End of Russian Power in Asia?" Orbis)

In 2003 the American Sinologist Lowell [[Dittmer called]{.mark} the
[Russia]{.mark} of 2000 [a diplomatic nonentity]{.mark}]{.underline}. 1
While this reﬂected Russia's overall position then, [this appellation
may soon describe Russia's position in East Asia]{.underline}. Though
Russia has been a vital player in Asia since the 1858 treaty of Aigun
with China, if not earlier, [Russian and foreign observers acknowledge
that in East Asia [it teeters on the edge of marginalization]{.mark} as
a signiﬁcant]{.underline}, not to mention great, [power]{.underline}.
This bleak assessment was conﬁrmed by analysts from Chinese, Japanese,
South Korean, and Mongolian think tanks who claimed in 2010 that Russia
would soon play no role in East Asian security. 2 For Russian leaders,
this is the nightmare outcome that they are striving to counter, hence
the vigor of Russia's recent policies. However, [[it is a common]{.mark}
Western [view]{.mark}]{.underline}, and apparently one shared by many
Chinese researchers, [that **[Russia is no longer an Asian
power]{.mark}.**]{.underline} 3 Thus The Institute of World Economy and
International Relations' (IMEMO) Director, Aleksandr Dynkin, writes that
[[absent radical reform, Russia will fall from]{.mark} [the rank of
great powers]{.mark} by 2030 [becoming only a middle power like
Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}. 4 And he is not alone in that view. This
prospect evokes such consternation in Russia that its ofﬁcials and
analysts have asserted a new coherence, purpose, and vigor in Russia's
Asian policy, claiming that Russian foreign policy's center of gravity
has been shifting to the East. 5 According to Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin, President Medvedev identiﬁed three main thrusts of his
foreign policy: relations with the West, the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), and the Asia-Paciﬁc region (APR). 6 Russian ofﬁcials
acknowledge that Asia is the dynamo of the global economy and assert the
emergence of a ''polycentric world order'' largely composed of rising
Asian powers. 7 To compete in this new order, Russia must ensure
favorable conditionsfor its modernization, elicit large-scale foreign
investment, participate in Asian integration and other processes, and
propose a new Asian order free of military blocs (i.e. the U.S. alliance
system). 8 Consequently Moscow vigorously pursues summitry, high-level
diplomatic meetings and speeches, and energy and arms sales in East Asia
(its main currencies of power there). Furthermore, Russia, as it has
done since Leonid Brezhnev, continues to ''proceed from the assumption
that one of the most important prerequisites and components of the
denuclearization process is the formation of regional common security
institutions which would be based on the principle of equal security to
all parties.'' 9 Nevertheless [[Moscow has little leverage]{.mark} on
East Asian processes]{.underline}. Moscow's warnings that the Korean
peninsula is on the brink of war predated North Korea's shelling of
Yeonpyeong Island and the display of a highly enriched uraniumplantmore
advanced than foreigners had believed possible. 10 [Russian and foreign
observers agree that [Moscow lacks inﬂuence upon Pyongyang or
other]{.mark} East Asian [states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[foreign
diplomats]{.mark} privately [ridiculed Russia]{.mark}'s contribution to
the Six-Party Talks [as]{.mark} being ''[more nuisance than
value]{.mark}]{.underline}.'' 11 Similarly Samuel Kim noted in 2004
that, Perhaps the most revealing part of the DPRK-Russia Moscow
Declaration of August 4, 2001 is embodiedinPoint Five:
''Inordertocarryout a series ofbilateralplans,theRussian side conﬁrmed
its intention to use the method of drawing ﬁnancial resources from
outsiders, on the basis of understanding oftheKorean side.''In other
words,Moscowand Pyongyang are now looking to Seoul, Washington, and
Tokyo to foot the bill. 12

### Impact\-\--A2: Russia Expansion\-\--Ext\-\--No Impact\-\--A2: Europe

#### Russia is strategically weak---multiple problems prevent aggressive invasions

**Rumer 15** - Eugene, Director and Senior Associate of the Russia and
Eurasia Program for the Carnegie Endowment, July 20, \"Russia\--A
Different Kind of Threat\",
<http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/07/20/russia-different-kind-of-threat/idml>

[Russian aggression against Ukraine has revived the long-forgotten craft
of marketing the Russian threat.]{.underline} Russia certainly is a
problem, and the U.S. relationship with it is at its worst since before
the Cold War ended. But [[a sober look at Russia]{.mark} [reveals a
superpower in decline. Its economy is stumbling]{.mark}]{.underline};
its [[military capabilities are no match]{.mark} for]{.underline} those
of [the United States and its allies]{.underline}; and [its actions are
in large measure driven by exaggerated threat perceptions]{.underline}
and insecurity at home and abroad. The revival of the Russian threat is
probably welcome in Moscow despite official protestations. Russian
elites were offended when President Obama put Russian aggression in
second place behind the Ebola virus when he described top international
threats in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in
September 2014. The recent statements by U.S. officials may reassure
Moscow that the United States finally takes Russia seriously as a peer
competitor. The reality is likely to be different. Russia is back as a
major challenge for European security. But it is a challenge of a
different kind than the challenge posed by the Soviet Union that exists
in the West's fading memories of the Cold War. The Economy [It is no
secret that the economy remains Russia's weak spot]{.underline}. It had
slowed to a crawl by the time the Ukraine crisis erupted in 2013.
Western [[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} imposed since then [[have
hurt]{.underline}]{.mark}, but not crippled, the economy, and [growth
will remain sluggish]{.underline} at best, even when Russia eventually
recovers from the recession. In 2015, the slump is expected to reduce
Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) by 4--5 percent. Former finance
minister and leading economic liberal Alexei Kudrin estimates average
growth of 1.5--2 percent for President Vladimir Putin's third term, from
2012 to 2018---a far cry from the glory days of his first two terms,
when the Russian economy grew by as much as 8.5 percent. What was the
strength of the Russian economy during Putin's first two terms as
president is now its weakness. Oil and gas revenues account for some 50
percent of the federal budget. When oil is expensive, Russia can afford
to index pensions to inflation, build Olympic and World Cup stadiums,
and modernize its defenses. [[When oil falls]{.underline}]{.mark} from
\$100 a barrel to \$50 a barrel, [[the splurge is difficult to
sustain]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a moment of remarkable candor in a June
2015 interview, the Kremlin chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, referred to
Russia's mineral wealth as a "curse" that had kept the country from
diversifying its economy. Russia had no motivation to reform when "a
golden rain" was pouring down on it, he said. Now [low oil prices are
crimping government spending]{.underline} and [sanctions have cut Russia
off from credit markets]{.underline}. The tough business climate and
uncertainty about the future are choking off new investment and reducing
prospects for growth. Domestic Politics Along with the economic troubles
come the Kremlin's deep-seated fears of political instability. There is
little, if any, domestic political opposition in Russia these days. What
opposition there is has long suffered from internal discord and, since
Putin's return to the presidency, has been decimated by the Kremlin's
harsh measures. But that is likely to be of little comfort to Putin.
Even his high approval ratings---almost 90 percent---could be
misleading. Ukraine's November 2013 popular uprising against then
president Victor Yanukovych must have been a reminder to the Russian
president that political fortunes can change quickly, especially if the
elite and oligarchs conspire against you. Opinion polls showed no sign
of the coming explosion, which was caused by Yanukovych's refusal to
sign an association agreement with the European Union (EU) and the
police's brutal handling of a small group of youthful, pro-EU
demonstrators in Kyiv's main square. In a nationwide poll conducted in
Ukraine in September 2013, an economic union with Russia was favored by
almost the same number of Ukrainians---37 percent---as an economic union
with Europe---42 percent. The people of Ukraine showed little interest
in politics; they were mistrustful of all politicians and overwhelmingly
concerned about day-to-day survival issues. Fifty-five percent of
respondents cited unemployment as their biggest concern; only 14 percent
worried about political instability. And 50 percent disapproved of
political protests without official permission. Throughout 2013,
Yanukovych had been accumulating ever more wealth, placing cronies in
key government and law enforcement posts, and chipping away at the power
of the oligarchs. The opposition was discredited by its failure to
govern after the 2004 Orange Revolution and hampered by internal
rivalries. There was no sign that the Yanukovych regime would collapse
in a matter of weeks, abandoned by many in the ruling elite who quickly
switched sides and supported the revolution. The Kremlin's relentless
quest for new and ever more elaborate tools to secure its control of
Russian politics and eradicate all sources of hostile
influence---domestic and external---is a sure sign of its nervousness. A
ban on foreign ownership of media outlets, restrictions on
nongovernmental organizations, the expulsion of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, the stream of propaganda equating democracy
with decadence, and warnings to the populace against the West's
pernicious influence are just a few elements of the Kremlin's political
offensive, which, no doubt, it sees as necessary self-defense. It never
seems to be enough, and it probably isn't. The Military [The Kremlin's
insecurity manifests itself in the defense sphere]{.underline} as well.
[[Operations in]{.underline}]{.mark} Crimea and eastern
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} have demonstrated that Russian military
capabilities have improved since the desperate days of the 1990s, when
the Russian military was practically written off. A far-reaching
military reform implemented between 2008 and 2012 and a huge surge in
resources for equipment, training, and personnel have resulted in a
military organization that is capable of defeating or denying access to
any adversary in the former Soviet space. But the war waged by Russia
against Ukraine in the summer of 2014 [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the
words of one prominent Russian military observer, [[a war fought
by]{.underline}]{.mark} two 1991-[[vintage
militaries]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the Russian military was simply
better trained, equipped, and led than the Ukrainian military.
[[Russian]{.mark} military [analysts]{.mark} [have a decades-old
concern]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that the West's technological
superiority]{.underline}]{.mark} and capabilities [[could
threaten]{.mark} the [survival]{.mark} of the Russian
state]{.underline}. The [[conventional superiority]{.mark} of the United
States, both real and projected]{.underline}---its air and naval power,
its precision-guided conventional weaponry, its global reach---[[has
long been a source of]{.underline}]{.mark} both fascination and profound
[[insecurity]{.mark} on the part of Russian military
analysts]{.underline}. Worse yet, they fear that over time, U.S. missile
defenses will erode Russia's ultimate deterrent---its strategic nuclear
weapons---and enable the United States to act unilaterally with
impunity. Looking at future challenges, the prospect of U.S. nuclear and
conventional long-range precision weapons combined with missile
defenses, space weapons, and cyber capabilities that could disrupt
Russian early warning and command and control systems must be the worst
nightmare of Russian defense planners responsible for the survival of
the country's nuclear deterrent. The United States may have no desire to
launch a disarming first strike against Russia, but as NATO officials
said during the Cold War, when they dismissed Soviet statements about
peaceful intentions, it's the capability that counts. Paradoxically,
Russian military exploits in Ukraine have undermined Russian security.
[The prospect of [renewed hostilities in]{.mark}]{.underline} eastern
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Kremlin's blatant attempts to
keep Kyiv on edge [[will force the Kremlin to maintain a sizeable
contingent]{.underline}]{.mark} of combat-ready Russian forces [[tied up
on the border]{.underline}]{.mark} with Ukraine. Estimates vary---from
10,000 to as many as 40,000, depending on the intensity of the crisis
and the source. These figures do not include some 15,000 troops
stationed in Crimea---in addition to the Black Sea fleet. There can be
little doubt that [[a sizeable portion of Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark}
roughly 260,000-strong [[army is tied up]{.underline}]{.mark} as a
result of the Russian "victory" in Ukraine.1 The army's 32,000 elite
airborne troops are deemed to be its best trained and equipped. Much of
the rest of the force is generally judged to be of lesser quality and
lower combat readiness. There are of course other contingencies---the
restive North Caucasus and the threat of instability in Central Asia,
for which Russian military planners claim they have to be ready, not to
mention the long (and vulnerable) border with China. However, the
European theater has dominated Russian security policy since the crisis
in Ukraine began. As seen from Moscow, [[Europe does pose a
challenge]{.mark}, if not an outright threat]{.underline}. Whether or
not NATO leaders are willing to admit it, [the alliance's expansion into
the former Warsaw Pact and even the Soviet Union has resulted in a
vastly different geopolitical balance in Europe, with Russia as the
loser]{.underline}. Ukraine's Maidan Revolution promises to bring NATO's
influence---if not its formal presence---to within 300 miles of Moscow.
That is a hard prospect for Russian military planners to accept calmly.
NATO spends some \$900 billion on defense each year, of which some \$600
billion is U.S. defense spending. NATO member states' combined GDP is
over \$30 trillion. The exact amount of Russian defense spending is not
publicly available. The published defense budget for 2015 was \$81
billion. Assuming generously that Russia spends 5 percent of its roughly
\$2 trillion GDP on defense, the total comes to \$100 billion. [[Its
armed forces total some 770,000, compared with NATO's 3.3
million]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ukraine---which presently is not a NATO
member---must now be viewed by Russian military planners as hostile
territory. Its leaders have declared their intent to join NATO, and
Russian aggression against Ukraine and threats to the Baltic states have
mobilized NATO to take steps it has not taken in many years. These
include reinvigorated planning for war with Russia, forward deployments
of U.S. and other allied military units along Russia's border,
prepositioning of weapons and equipment in Eastern Europe, show-of-force
exercises, and training of and deliveries of military hardware to the
Ukrainian army, to name just some of the most visible elements of the
new security environment on Russia's doorstep as a result of its actions
in Ukraine. [Against this backdrop, Russian threats]{.underline} to
deploy nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad, on the Baltic Sea, or to Crimea;
long-range bomber patrols near the borders of the United States and its
NATO allies; harassment of U.S. Navy ships in international waters; and
other moves [appear not as a sign of confidence, but]{.underline} as a
sign of [nervousness]{.underline} about NATO's military superiority. A
government confident of its conventional military capabilities hardly
needs to engage in nuclear scaremongering and threaten nuclear
annihilation to neighbors contemplating legitimate self-defense measures
on their territory.

### Impact\-\--A2: Tac Nucs\-\--Impact

#### Tactical nuke risk severely overblown -- not more usable

**Costlow 18** (Matthew Costlow, Policy Analyst at National Institute
for Public Policy, Breaking Defense, January 23, 2018, Accessed: July
11, 2019, "Big Fear of Small Nukes Overblown",
https://breakingdefense.com/2018/01/big-fears-of-small-nukes-overblown/)

[[Critics]{.underline}]{.mark} of the proposal, however, [[argue]{.mark}
that [the lower]{.mark} a nuclear weapon's [yield]{.mark} is, the less
destructive it is, therefore [making it "more usable" and]{.mark}
general [nuclear war more likely]{.mark}. This is a grave accusation
that [requires a factual rebuttal]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[If low-yield nuclear weapons are more "more usable," we would]{.mark}
expect to [see]{.mark} a rash of international [nuclear crises]{.mark}
[during the]{.mark} 19[70s]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [the U.S.
low-yield]{.mark} tactical [nuclear weapon stockpile was at its
height]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} But there was only one such crisis
then, the Arab-Israeli War, which was certainly not caused by low-yield
nuclear weapons. Despite having reportedly nearly 7,000 low-yield
nuclear weapons at their disposal, U.S. Presidents did not seem very
tempted to use them.

In fact, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [eliminated over
90% of its tactical nuclear weapons post-Cold War]{.underline}, so
pro-disarmament theory holds that the likelihood of nuclear war should
have also receded to a matching degree. Yet the same individuals now say
we are closer to war despite these reductions. Critics cannot have it
both ways, [either the reductions of tactical nuclear weapons have
decreased the chances of war or [political factors outside the weapons
themselves in isolation determine the likelihood of
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Clearly the evidence favors the
latter]{.underline}.

In reality, the United States has reportedly retained low-yield nuclear
weapons in its stockpile for over five decades. Republican and
Democratic presidents have historically sought less-destructive nuclear
options to make nuclear use less likely by better deterring nuclear
aggression.

### Impact\-\--A2: Tac Nucs\-\--UQ

#### Modernizing now - Russia already testing new low-yield nukes

**Pickrell 19** (Ryan Pickrell, a Pentagon correspondent at Business
Insider, May 29, 2019, Accessed: July 7, 2019, Business Insider, "The US
says Russia has been cheating on an arms control treaty and secretly
testing low-yield nukes to strengthen its arsenal",
<https://www.businessinsider.com/us-says-russia-has-been-secretly-testing-low-yield-nukes-2019-5>)

US intelligence agencies suspect that [[Russia has been]{.mark} secretly
[conducting low-yield nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[tests]{.mark}]{.underline} in violation of an international treaty
prohibiting this type of testing.

\"[The United States believes that Russia probably is not adhering to
its nuclear testing moratorium]{.underline} in a manner consistent with
the \'zero-yield\' standard,\" Director of the US Defense Intelligence
Agency Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley wrote in his prepared remarks for a talk
at the Hudson Institute Wednesday, The Wall Street
Journal[reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-says-russia-likely-conducting-low-yield-nuke-tests-defying-test-ban-treaty-11559135102?mod=hp_lead_pos6),
adding that the other intelligence agencies have arrived at similar
conclusions as DIA.

No evidence of Russian violations have yet been presented.

[Russia is suspected to have conducted a number of very low-yield
nuclear tests [at its Novaya Zemlya testing facility in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. US officials declined to tell The WSJ what
explosive yields may have been involved in the tests, which would be
considered violations of the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

The US halted nuclear testing in 1992 after 1,030 nuclear detonations.
Russia followed suit after 715 explosions, ratifying the treaty in 2000.
The Russians were hesitant to agree to US \"zero-yield\" demands, but
they did agree eventually. [[There have long been concerns]{.mark} in
the US that the understanding of the treaty\'s requirements in Russia
may be different from Washington\'s perceptions]{.underline}.

\"Our understanding of nuclear weapon development leads us to believe
[[Russia\'s testing]{.mark} activities [would help it improve its
nuclear]{.mark} weapon [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Ashley
assessed.

#### Russia has been modernizing nukes since the cold war -- over two thirds done

We say our nuclear deterrent is our highest priority; Russia says the
same thing and really means it[. [Since]{.underline}]{.mark} [the end of
[the Cold War, the Russian government has announced]{.mark} about [25
strategic nuclear modernization programs]{.mark} which are mainly new
systems carrying new nuclear warheads]{.underline}. In January 2017,
Russian Defense Minister General of the Army Sergei Shoigu stated that
[development of the strategic nuclear force was Russia's first
priority]{.underline}, noting that [Russia will "...continue a massive
program of nuclear rearmament, deploying modern ICBMs on land and sea,
\[and\] modernizing the strategic bomber
force."]{.underline}[[\[1\]](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/07/putins_nuclear_superweapons_113411.html#_edn1) Russia
sees its great-power status based on its nuclear capability]{.underline}
which probably exceeds that of the rest of the world combined.

Putin's recent claim of 79% modernization of Russia's nuclear Triad
seems exaggerated. However, [[Russia has modernized over two-thirds of
its Triad]{.mark} since the process began]{.underline} in
1997[\[2\]](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/07/putins_nuclear_superweapons_113411.html#_edn2) [[and
will modernize the rest]{.mark}]{.underline} before we modernize any of
our strategic delivery vehicles in a significant way. Moreover, Russia
is expanding its nuclear force. Serious U.S. modernization will not
begin for almost another decade in the best case scenario.

The threat posed by Russian nuclear ambitions was recognized in the 2018
Nuclear Posture Review report which states, "While Russia initially
followed America's lead and made similarly sharp reductions in its
strategic nuclear forces, it retained large numbers of non-strategic
nuclear weapons. [Today, Russia is modernizing these weapons [as well as
its other strategic systems]{.mark}. Even [more troubling has been
Russia's adoption of military strategies and capabilities that rely on
nuclear escalation for their success]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
developments, coupled with Russia's seizure of Crimea and nuclear
threats against our allies, mark Moscow's decided return to Great Power
competition."[\[3\]](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/07/putins_nuclear_superweapons_113411.html#_edn3) It
continued, "[In addition to modernizing 'legacy' Soviet nuclear systems,
[Russia is developing and deploying new nuclear warheads and
launchers]{.mark}.]{.underline} These efforts [include multiple upgrades
for every leg of the Russian nuclear triad of strategic bombers,
sea-based missiles, and land-based missiles]{.underline}. Russia is also
developing at least two new intercontinental range systems, a hypersonic
glide vehicle, and a new intercontinental, nuclear-armed,
nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous
torpedo."[\[4\]](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/05/07/putins_nuclear_superweapons_113411.html#_edn4)

put us]{.mark} certainly [challenged in]{.mark} a military domain in
[almost every perspective by]{.mark}, say, [2025]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Last month, EUCOM requested \$6.5 billion for its key program in the
region, the [European Deterrence
Initiative](https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/839028/european-reassurance-initiative-shifts-to-deterrence/),
which bolsters air, sea, and land forces across the continent. That's
\$2 billion more than requested in fiscal
2018. EUCOM leaders [said](http://www.eucom.mil/media-library/article/36241/u-s-increases-commitment-to-deterrence-with-edi-request) it
reflected the need to "deter aggression and malign influence in Europe
by increasing our air, sea and land force responsiveness, and expanding
interoperability with multi-national forces."

[Russian President Vladimir [Putin has been eager to show
off]{.mark}]{.underline} of new and eye-catching capabilities
in [hypersonic
weapons](http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/03/united-states-accelerating-development-its-own-invincible-hypersonic-weapons/146355/).
Analysts have also noted [[a decade of Russian prowess]{.mark} in
electronic and cyber warfare]{.underline}, as displayed from [Eastern
Ukraine](http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/03/ukraine-tomorrows-drone-war-alive-today/107085/)to [Syria.](http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/04/can-us-warplanes-evade-russian-air-defenses-we-may-soon-find-out-syria/136867/)

Scaparrotti's [warning comes on the heels of [[a new report
from RAN]{.mark}D](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2402.html)]{.underline},
which [[notes a]{.mark} growing "[imbalance" of U.S. and European forces
in Eastern Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Improvements in Russia's
military forces over the last decade have reduced the once-gaping
qualitative and technological gaps between Russia and NATO. These
[improvements come while [Russia is expanding its forces in the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [maintaining]{.underline}]{.mark} [more
[high-readiness forces, and gaining valuable combat experience]{.mark}
in Ukraine and Syria]{.underline}," the [unclassified
version](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2402.html) of the
report says.

### Impact\-\--Regional\-\--A2: Asia\-\--2AC

#### No Russia influence on Asia- long term relationship is impossible

School of International Studies (RSIS). He was a Foreign Service
Officer, working in various capacities in the European department
dealing with Western and Eastern Europe, the Southeast Asia department
dealing with Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, the Computer and

International Economics department dealing with APEC, and FreeTrade
Agreements., PA.November 9, 2017 ("Russia-ASEAN Relations: Where Are
They Headed?," RSIS, Available Online at

[[RUSSIA-ASEAN]{.mark} [relations]{.mark} are [likely to develop]{.mark}
in a [slow]{.mark}, incremental fashion]{.underline} over the next few
years. There are [reasons for adopting a doubting Thomas
approach]{.underline}. To begin with, unlike China and the US,
[[Russia]{.mark} [has]{.mark} had [no tradition of strong
relations]{.mark} with Southeast Asia]{.underline}. Except with Vietnam
and Indonesia in the 60s, Moscow's links with the region had been little
to speak of.

Secondly, [[without]{.mark} [meaningful]{.mark} economic/[trade
ties]{.mark} [no]{.mark} [mutually beneficial
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} can develop. According to the ASEAN
Secretariat, as of November 2016, [ASEAN's [total trade]{.mark} with
Russia [amounted]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a mere US\$[13.3
billion]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[in]{.mark} contrast [with]{.mark}
[China]{.mark} (US[\$345 billion]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates (US[\$212 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}).
Even President Putin noted this "modest figure compared to trade with
other countries in the Asia-Pacific region" during his speech at the
Russia-ASEAN Summit in Sochi in May 2016.

Weak Fundamentals: Other Factors

[Thirdly, the necessary time, [energy and resources]{.mark} have
[not]{.mark} been fully [devoted]{.mark} to developing the relationship
with ASEAN]{.underline}. Russia's [[leaders]{.mark} [and]{.mark} top
[businessmen]{.mark} were, are and will [remain Euro- and
US-centric]{.mark}]{.underline}; the "Asia-Pacific" that matters to them
is really China, Japan, and South Korea.

Russia's top trading partners in 2016 were the Netherlands, China, the
Federal Republic of Germany, with South Korea and Japan in 7th and 10th
place respectively. It is [difficult to conceive this pattern changing
with respect to ASEAN in the next five, or even 10 years.]{.underline}

Finally, [[managing]{.mark} the current [tensions]{.mark} in Russia's
relations [with]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} and the [E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion, the [Ukraine]{.mark} and [Syria]{.mark}n crises, as well
as relations with [China]{.mark}, [will occupy]{.mark} most of Russia's
[attention]{.mark} for the next few years.]{.underline}

[President [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} is expected to emerge the victor
in the 2018 elections. His energy, [[attention]{.underline}]{.mark} and
focus for the six years after that, will be [[concentrated on
consolidating his legacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, being the longest-serving
Russian leader, apart from Stalin.

[If he devotes any time to foreign affairs, it would be focused
on]{.underline} the areas critical to Russia's foreign policy such as
the [US, Ukraine and Syria.]{.underline} [ASEAN cannot hope to be on his
foreign policy agenda.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Regional\-\--A2: Asia\-\--1AR

#### Even if arms sales important, they can't create ties

The [one [bright spot]{.mark} in Russia's economic links with ASEAN [is
weapons sales]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to a March 2017 Chatham
House report, "Asia is by far the most important export market for
Russian arms". China and India constitute 56% of all Russian weapons
exports from 2000-2016; however, Vietnam accounted for 5.6%, Myanmar
1.4%, Malaysia 1.3 % and Indonesia 1.1%.

However, [weapons [sales]{.mark} [cannot]{.mark} [become]{.mark} a
strong [foundation]{.mark} of ASEAN's relationship with Russia,
[given]{.mark} its [one-dimensional nature]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, the [[US]{.mark} still [remains]{.mark} a [major
source]{.mark} for ASEAN.]{.underline} Finally, any [[continued and
growing Russian weapons sales]{.mark} to Vietnam [runs]{.mark} the
[risk]{.mark} [of antagonising China]{.mark}]{.underline}.
