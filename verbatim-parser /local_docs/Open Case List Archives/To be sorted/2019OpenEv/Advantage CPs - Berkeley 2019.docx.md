political instability: Trajectories for sub-Saharan Africa,\" ReliefWeb,
<https://reliefweb.int/report/world/structural-pressures-and-political-instability-trajectories-sub-saharan-africa>)

Sub-Saharan Africa has made important peace and security gains over the
past two decades. Large-scale political violence has declined and fewer
people are dying in wars. But other forms of [[political
violence]{.mark} have [increased, and the region's future will]{.mark}
still [be turbulent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Some [countries are more at risk of instability]{.mark} and violent
conflict, [each with their own unique set of pressures and potential
paths to instability]{.mark}. For example, entirely different factors
drive the civil war in South Sudan, election violence in Kenya, the
farmer-herder conflict in Nigeria's Middle Belt, and armed conflict in
the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).]{.underline}

A new Institute for Security Studies (ISS)
[report](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ar9.pdf)
uses five distinct models from the International Futures forecasting
system (IFs) to explore possible trajectories of political instability
in sub-Saharan Africa until 2040.

Understanding these trajectories is key to successful conflict
prevention, peacebuilding efforts and long-term development. The ISS
report was written with the Frederick S Pardee Center for International
[Futures](https://pardee.du.edu/) at the University of Denver as part of
the Political Settlements Research
[Programme](http://www.politicalsettlements.org/).

[[Inequalities and state-led discrimination are likely to continue to
fuel grievances and instability]{.underline}]{.mark}

The ISS assessed the potential impact of various structural pressures on
instability and [violent
conflict](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/violence-africa-trends-drivers-and-prospects-2023).
[Structural pressures refer to broad development contexts that can
exacerbate or mitigate risk of instability.]{.underline} They are not
immediate drivers or predictors of political instability, which is
understood as abrupt regime change, civil war, genocides and the
systematic killings of political opponents.

The [[key structural pressures]{.mark} that [threaten peace and
stability]{.mark} in sub-Saharan Africa [stem from
[demographics](https://issafrica.org/research/africa-report/getting-to-africas-demographic-dividend),
low levels of development, regime type, and horizontal inequalities or
cross-group discrimination.]{.mark} Uneven progress across major
development transitions can also heighten the risk of instability (see
Figure 1). Structural pressures tend to change slowly, but not
necessarily evenly.]{.underline}

The findings of the ISS research yield both optimism and uncertainty.
Overall, sub-Saharan Africa's vulnerability to political instability has
declined since the mid-1970s. The region's current age structure does
not promote stability, but Figure 2 shows that demographic risk has been
reducing steadily and will decrease further to 2040.

The risk from low levels of development -- a proxy for low state
capacity and legitimacy -- has also eased and is projected to reduce
more as the region improves its socio-economic performance.

On the other hand, [[inequalities]{.mark} and state-led discrimination
across groups are likely to [continue to fuel grievances and
instability]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is connected to the greatest
challenge to future stability across sub-Saharan Africa -- regimes that
are neither fully autocratic nor fully democratic, but somewhere in
between. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa fall into this category of
mixed regime type.

The countries that face the greatest demographic risk to 2040 overlap
significantly with those where most people died during 2000-16 from
political violence -- Sudan, Nigeria, the DRC, Somalia, South Sudan and
the Central African Republic (CAR).

Nigeria faces the greatest risk from demographic pressures because of
its large and rapidly growing young population. And its high infant
mortality rate testifies to a history of governance that has
systematically failed to provide basic services.

Larger populations often provide more opportunities for clashes between
different regional or ethnic groups. They are also more difficult for
states to control, and opposition groups can more easily mobilise and
recruit supporters. Rapidly growing populations increase competition
over land and other resources.

Lastly, youthful populations are more prone to violent conflict than
older populations. This risk multiplies when young people are
marginalised and lack opportunities due to poor policy making and
failing economic development.

[[Extreme poverty will remain a key characteristic]{.mark} of
sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline} with more than a third of the region's
population expected to survive on less than US\$1.90 per person per day
in 2040. Generally, [[countries with low levels of GDP per
capita,]{.mark} slow GDP per capita growth and low life expectancy [are
more prone to instability]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Poor democracies are more vulnerable to political instability than any
type of autocratic regime

South Sudan, CAR, Somalia and Burundi face the highest current and
future risk for instability associated with poor development. Southern
Africa will remain the region least vulnerable to this type of pressure,
while West Africa faces the greatest risk.

Building on the research on regime type and political instability from
the Polity IV
[project](http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html), IFs
forecasts that Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo,
and Ethiopia are facing particularly high pressure due to their mixed
regime type. According to Jack Goldstone et al, mixed regime types are
much more
[unstable](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.duke.edu%2Fniou%2Ffiles%2F2011%2F06%2Fgoldstone-bates-etal.pdf)
than either democracies or autocracies and are particularly vulnerable
to regime change.

[[Stability in autocracies]{.mark} often [comes at the price of
repression]{.mark} or co-optation of opposition forces]{.underline}
while democracies rely on political inclusion to mediate diverging
interests and societal grievances. [[Mixed regimes are less effective in
both respects.]{.underline}]{.mark}

At the same time, [[poor democracies such as Malawi could be more
unstable than any type of autocratic regime]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Imbalances can also arise when relatively democratic countries have
large youth bulges, such as Kenya. In most Southern African countries,
relatively high levels of GDP per capita are at odds with low life
expectancy.

The analysis points to the [[composite character of instability]{.mark}
and the complexity of systems in which similar drivers [can impact risk
in different ways]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the face of such complexity,
policy makers benefit from a multi-dimensional and dynamic understanding
of risk. Modelling and forecasting can help identify opportunities for
investment in development and peace.

### 2NC -- AfCFTA -- Solvency

#### The US must join the AfCFTA to have a reciprocal effect -- also removes Africa from poverty

**[Hammond 6/12]{.underline}** \[Alexander C. R. Hammond is a researcher
at a Washington D.C. think tank and Senior Fellow for African Liberty.
He is also a Young Voices contributor and frequently writes about
economic freedom, African development, and globalization. \"Africa's New
Free-Trade Area is Great News for America.\" National Interest,
6-12-2019,
[nationalinterest.org/feature/africa's-new-free-trade-area-great-news-america-62407](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/africa's-new-free-trade-area-great-news-america-62407)\]

The poorest continent in the world is about to lend a hand to the United
States. Last week, [[Africa implemented the **world's largest free-trade
area**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[that's great news for American
fo]{.underline}]{.mark}reign [[po]{.underline}]{.mark}licy. Back in
December, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton unveiled a plan for
the Trump administration's titled the "Africa Strategy." The plan is
simple---the United States will give less aid to Africa, instead
prioritizing enhancing America's "economic ties with the region." [[Now
that]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[African nations have unified under a
single market]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[trading with the continent will
be]{.underline}]{.mark}come far [[easier]{.underline}]{.mark}---and a
trade deal between the United States and Africa would help out everyone
involved.

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) trade deal officially
came into force on May 30, a month after it reached the
twenty-two-nation threshold needed to do so. Now, tariffs on 90 percent
of the goods traded among AfCFTA member states will be removed---a move
that, according to the UN, will boost intra-African trade by 52 percent
in only a few years.

The [[AfCFTA members are already planning]{.underline}]{.mark} the next
step in economic integration---a customs union enabling African states
to negotiate free trade deals with other countries, [[including the
United States]{.underline}]{.mark}, as a bloc.

A key component of the Trump administration's Africa Strategy is to
advance "U.S. trade and commercial ties" with Africa by creating "modern
comprehensive trade agreements." An African customs union would be a far
simpler trade partner for America because only one set of trade deals
will need to be negotiated with the AfCFTA countries---as opposed to
fifty-five intricately-crafted trade deals with each small African
economy. The U.S. Trade Representative has even released a report noting
how time-consuming and costly it is to negotiate trade deals with each
African nation. Because trade deals are long and expensive processes,
creating a single trade deal with an African customs union will keep
more money in the U.S. government's purse.

As Bolton notes, [[another key aim of the Africa Strategy is to create a
more]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[reciprocal
exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the United States and the
nations of Africa." If all fifty-five African nations unite under the
AfCFTA, then it'll do just that. In fact, it'll create a market with a
shocking GDP of over \$3 trillion---the fifth-largest economy in the
world. American businesses will soon find fantastic opportunities to buy
cheaper commodities, and to manufacture their goods at a lower cost than
would have otherwise been possible. If the United States imports its
low-value goods from Africa, rather than producing them domestically,
then the U.S. economy can focus on what it best produces: high-value
specialized goods and services.

[[If the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
really [[wants]{.underline}]{.mark} to follow through on its plan [[to
help Africa's economy thrive]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[then it is
**vital** that a U.S.-AfCFTA trade deal **replaces**
existing]{.underline}]{.mark} American preferential trade schemes like
the African Growth and Opportunity Act ([[AGOA]{.underline}]{.mark}).
Right now, [[AGOA]{.underline}]{.mark} gives developing African
countries duty-free access to the U.S. market for some goods, but the
agreement is bogged down with far too many exceptions that can change on
a whim---[causing havoc for domestic African industries dependent on the
American trade scheme]{.underline}. Last year, for example, the United
States unexpectedly changed AGOA's terms and suspended Rwanda's ability
to [[export clothing duty-free, damaging the Rwandan textile industry
and putting hundreds of jobs at risk]{.underline}]{.mark} (mostly
women's jobs). Moving away from these malevolent trade schemes and
toward a more reciprocal agreement with mutual, unchangeable rules would
go a long way in providing economic stability to the poor in Africa.

So far, twenty-four of the fifty-five African member states have
ratified the AfCFTA and now that the trade area is operational, many
more African nations are expected to join in the coming months. As more
countries join the free trade area, an African customs union becomes
ever more likely, and [[the potential benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} for
both parties [[to create a U.S.-AfCFTA trade deal will continue to
grow]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While the United States seeks to expand trade with the world's poorest
continent, we should all celebrate the fact that a mutually beneficial
relationship between America and Africa may finally be on the horizon.
[[A trade deal between the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[AfCFTA]{.underline}]{.mark} customs union [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
would [[boost the prosperity of all parties]{.underline}]{.mark}
involved and in the case of Africa, [[potentially **lift millions of the
world's poorest people out of extreme poverty**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Let's hope this trade deal is implemented soon.

about it,\" Conversation,
<https://theconversation.com/what-drives-instability-in-africa-and-what-can-be-done-about-it-87626>)

[[Africa will remain turbulent because it is poor and
young]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also because it is growing and dynamic.
Development is disruptive but also presents huge opportunities. The
continent needs to plan accordingly.

[[Levels of armed conflict in Africa rise and fall]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Data from the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program](http://ucdp.uu.se/), the
[Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) and
[others](https://www.acleddata.com/) indicate that armed conflict peaked
in 1990/91 at the end of the Cold War, declined to 2005/6, remained
relative stable to 2010/11 and then increased to 2015, although it
peaked at lower levels than in 1990/91 before its most recent decline.

Armed conflict has
[changed](https://issafrica.org/research/papers/future-im-perfect-mapping-conflict-violence-and-extremism-in-africa).
Today [[there are]{.mark} many more [non-state actors involved in armed
conflict]{.mark} in Africa -- representing a greater fracturing of armed
groupings. So [it's]{.mark} not [a matter of]{.mark} "government vs an
armed group" but a "[government vs many armed
groups]{.mark}"]{.underline}. Insurgents are often divided and sometimes
even fighting amongst themselves. This greater fragmentation complicates
peacemaking.

Terrorism has also
[increased](https://issafrica.org/research/papers/violent-islamist-extremism-and-terror-in-africa),
but depending on how one defines it, it has always been widely prevalent
in Africa both as a tactic to secure decolonisation as well as between
and among competing armed groups. The big question for 2017 is: is
violent political extremism going to move from the Middle East to
Africa? Put another way, is it in Africa that Al Qaeda and the Islamic
State will find solid footage as they are displaced from the Middle
East?

Anti government
[turbulence](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/less-armed-conflict-but-more-political-violence-in-africa)
has also increased in recent years. In Africa, this has led to
disaffection and violence around elections that are often rigged rather
than free and fair. Generally this is because governance in many African
countries present [a facade of
democracy](https://issafrica.org/research/papers/the-future-of-democracy-in-africa)
but don't yet reflect substantive democracy.

Seven relationships lie behind patterns of violence on the continent,
and provide insights into whether it can be managed better.

Relationships explaining violence

Poverty

[[Internal armed conflict is much more prevalent in poor
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} than in rich ones. This is not because
poor people are violent but because poor states lack the ability to
ensure law and order. [[The impact of poverty is exacerbated by
inequality]{.mark}, such as in [South
Africa](https://issafrica.org/research/papers/economics-governance-and-instability-in-south-africa).]{.underline}

Updated forecasts using the [International Futures forecasting
system](http://pardee.du.edu/understand-interconnected-world) indicate
that around 37% of Africans live in extreme poverty (roughly 460 million
people).

By 2030, 32% of Africans (forecast at 548 million) are likely to live in
extreme poverty. So, while the portion is coming down (around 5% less),
the absolute numbers will likely increase by around 90 million. It's
therefore unlikely that Africa will meet the first of the Sustainable
Development Goals on [ending absolute
poverty](https://issafrica.org/research/papers/reasonable-goals-for-reducing-poverty-in-africa-targets-for-the-post-mdgs-and-agenda-2063)
on a current growth path of roughly 4% GDP growth per annum.

Democratisation

[[Democratisation can trigger violence in the short]{.mark}]{.underline}
to medium [[term]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly around
[elections](https://issafrica.org/pscreport/addis-insights/turbulent-elections-in-africa-in-2016-the-need-for-truth-telling-from-the-au).
[[Recent events in
[Kenya](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/kenya-grapples-with-domestic-and-foreign-security-threats)
are an example. Where there is a large democratic deficit]{.mark}, as in
North Africa before the [Arab
spring](https://theconversation.com/a-vibrant-civil-society-is-central-to-democratic-consolidation-in-tunisia-55525),
[tension builds up]{.mark} and can explode.]{.underline}

[And [a democratic deficit]{.mark} -- where levels of democracy are
below what can be expected [when compared to other countries at similar
levels of income and education]{.mark} -- often [leads to
instability]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Instability is also fuelled by the manipulation of
[elections](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/elections-in-2017-can-the-au-up-its-game)
and constitutions]{.underline} by heads of state to extend their stay in
power. Examples include
[Burundi](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/think-again-can-burundi-bury-the-ghosts-of-its-troubled-past),
the [Democratic Republic of
Congo](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/without-elections-the-drcs-economy-will-continue-to-slide)
(DR Congo) and Uganda.

Regime type

The nature of the [governing
regime](http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html) is another
structural factor. Most stable countries are either full democracies or
full autocracies. But [[most African countries have mixed
regimes]{.mark} with some elements of democracy mixed with strong
autocratic features. They present a façade of democracy but lack its
substantive elements. [Mixed regimes are inherently more unstable and
prone to disruptions]{.mark}]{.underline} than either full democracies
or full autocracies.

Population structure

[Africa's [population is
young](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2177.html),
with a median age of 19. By comparison, the median age is 41 in France
(a relatively young country by European standards). So 22% of adult
French are in the youth bulge of 15-29 years compared to 47% of
Africans.]{.underline}

[[Young countries tend to be more turbulent because young men are
largely responsible for violence and crime]{.mark}. If young people lack
jobs and rates of urbanisation are high, [social exclusion and
instability follow]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Repeat violence

A history of violence is generally the best predictor of future
violence. [[Countries such as
[Mali](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/malis-electoral-cycle-fraught-with-obstacles-and-instability),]{.mark}
[Central African
Republic](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/challenges-ahead-for-au-in-ending-car-conflict)
[and the
[DRC](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/in-sadc-the-interests-of-ruling-parties-come-first)
are trapped in cycles of violence]{.mark}. This is very difficult to
break. [It requires a huge effort and is very expensive, often requiring
a large, multi-dimensional peace mission]{.mark} that only the UN can
provide.]{.underline} But, scaling peacekeeping back rather than scaling
it up is the order of the day at the
[UN](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/what-trumps-stance-on-africa-means-for-continental-security-efforts).

A bad neighbourhood

Where a country is located can increase the risk of violence because
[[borders are not controlled and rural areas not policed]{.mark}. Most
[conflict in Africa is supported from neighbouring
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. Violence spills over national borders
and affects other countries while poorly trained and equipped law and
order institutions generally cannot operate regionally.

Slow growth and rising inequality

[[Africa is]{.mark} quite [unequal, so growth does n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark}
[translate into poverty reduction]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, the
world is in a low growth environment after the 2007/8 global financial
crisis, with average rates of growth significantly lower than before.
Africa needs to grow at average rates of 7% or more a year if it is to
reduce poverty and create jobs, yet current long term forecasts are for
rates significantly below that.

Opportunity amid challenges

[These seven related factors indicate that [the notion that Africa
can]{.mark} somehow "[silence the guns by 2020]{.mark}", as advocated by
the African Union as part of its [Agenda
2063](https://au.int/en/agenda2063) [is
unrealistic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Violence will remain a characteristic
of [a number of African
countries](https://issafrica.org/research/monographs/assessing-long-term-state-fragility-in-africa-prospects-for-26-more-fragile-countries)
for many years to come and Africa should plan accordingly.

[In the long term [only rapid, inclusive economic growth combined with
good governance can chip away at the structural drivers of
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is also clear that middle income
countries are making progress in attracting foreign direct investment
but that poor countries will remain [aid
dependent](https://issafrica.org/research/africa-in-the-world-report/fertility-growth-and-the-future-of-aid-in-sub-saharan-africa).

[Much more international and regional cooperation will be required as
part of this process, including substantive and scaled up support for
[peacekeeping](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/turning-point-for-the-au-un-peacekeeping-partnership).]{.underline}

[[Washington's]{.underline}]{.mark} No 1. [[priority will be developing
economic ties with the region to create opportunities
for]{.underline}]{.mark} American [[businesses and
protect]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[the independence of African
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} along with U.S. national security
interests, he said in a speech at the Heritage Foundation.

"Great-power competitors, namely [[China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[are **rapidly** expanding their financial
and political influence across Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}," Bolton
said.

"[[They are]{.underline}]{.mark} deliberately and aggressively
[[targeting their investments]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region [[to
gain]{.underline}]{.mark} a competitive [[advantage over the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates."

U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of
the world's two largest economies, have been trying to resolve trade
disputes that have roiled markets.

"[[China uses **bribes**]{.mark}, **[opaque agreements]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the strategic [**[use of debt]{.mark}** [to
hold states in Africa captive]{.mark}]{.underline} to Beijing's wishes
and demands. Its investment ventures are riddled with corruption,"
Bolton said. He had equally harsh words for Russia.

"Across the continent, Russia advances its political and economic
relationships with little regard for the rule of law or accountable and
transparent governance," he said.

He accused Moscow of selling arms and energy in exchange for votes at
the United Nations "that keep strongmen in power, undermine peace and
security, and run counter to the best interests of the African people."

Bolton said "predatory practices" by [[China and Russia **stunt**
economic growth in Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} and threaten nations'
economic independence.

He said the United States was developing the "Prosper Africa" initiative
to support U.S. investment in Africa and a growing middle class in the
region. He gave no details.

Landry Signe, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Africa Growth
Initiative in Washington, welcomed the administration's focus on trade
and investment as opposed to security, but wanted details on planned
U.S. action.

"The Trump administration's new Africa Strategy reflects a more accurate
understanding of the fast-changing dynamics within Africa," he said,
"but the strategy doesn't seem sufficient to effectively address the
United States' threatened economic, security, and influence interests."

Judd Devermont, director of the Africa Program at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said release of an
Africa strategy was welcome after two years of "conflicting narratives"
by the administration.

Devermont said he was disappointed that China dominated Bolton's
presentation, which lacked details on U.S. plans.

"China loomed over everything, and loomed over really important issues
on trade and investment, and transparency," said Devermont. "We didn't
get many details on what the 'Prosper Africa' approach looks like and
how it would be resourced. Those should have been the headlines of the
strategy."

"We need a greater articulation on what are the sectors that the U.S.
government wants to prioritize in Africa for U.S. investment," Devermont
said, "They should be transparent with the Africans to explain why
certain countries are getting the bulk of the investment."

China's policies in Africa have concerned Washington as the United
States seeks to ramp up development finance in the face of China's
global ambitions.

In July, the head of the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp (OPIC)
said China was saddling poor nations with unsustainable debt through
large infrastructure projects that are not economically viable.

Bolton said the American approach contrasted with China's "bait and
switch" policies. "The way we do business is much more straightforward."

In October Trump signed legislation overhauling the way the federal
government lends money for foreign development, creating a \$60 billion
agency intended largely to respond to China's growing influence. The new
U.S. International Development Finance Corp combines OPIC and other
government development organizations.

Xi's "Belt and Road" initiative, unveiled in 2013, aims to build an
infrastructure network connecting China by land and sea to Southeast
Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

Bolton said the lack of economic progress in Africa has created a
climate conducive to violent conflict and the proliferation of
terrorism.

He said the United States has little to show for the billions of dollars
it has poured into Africa. He said [[the
admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration will work to [[ensure U.S. aid is
used more efficiently and effectively]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
investments in health, education, government and fiscal transparency
measures and rule of law.

"[[We will make certain that ALL aid to the region - whether for
security, humanitarian, or development needs]{.underline}]{.mark} -
advances U.S. interests," he said, adding that [[Washington will also
re-evaluate its support for U.N. peacekeeping
missions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Prosper Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} aligns with the Trump
administration's Africa strategy, introduced by National Security
Adviser John Bolton last December, which [[aims to promote prosperity,
security, and stability in U.S.-Africa relations]{.underline}]{.mark},
and confirms the administration's prioritization of trade and investment
to reach those three objectives. This strategy might be "one of the most
business-friendly U.S.-Africa policies in recent times---at least in
principle." Now, though, [[the admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[has
to bridge the gap between its praiseworthy business principles and the
policy options needed to turn them into reality]{.underline}]{.mark}.

counter to **Chinese** and **Russian** "**predatory practices**" and

however, presented by U.S. officials as an innovative method of engaging
with African leaders and entrepreneurs through a coordinated effort
among U.S. agencies---with less reference to China. The initiative is a
welcome change from the administration's previous comments about
avoiding engagement with some African countries and intentionally
decreasing African immigration into the U.S. Though Prosper Africa
cannot entirely make up for this rhetoric, nor the \$252 million funding
cuts to Ebola response efforts in early 2018, [[the strategy is a first
step in improving the coordination of U.S. efforts toward better trade
and investment relations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Prosper Africa aims to reverse the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates[[']{.underline}]{.mark} [[**eroding
ground** in African markets by providing]{.underline}]{.mark} technical
[[assistance]{.underline}]{.mark} for U.S. and African [companies in
order to double two-way trade]{.underline} and investment. It includes a
special focus on transparent markets and private enterprise as the
foundations of economic growth and job creation. According to Deputy
Secretary of Commerce Karen Kelly, [[Prosper Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}
has three coordinated lines of effort: 1) synchronizing the initiatives
and capabilities of government agencies, 2) modernizing and coordinating
those agencies' resources to help companies identify business
opportunities in African markets, and 3) building African capacity
through private sector strengthening. According to the administration,
the presidential initiative will operate [[in conjunction
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the new U.S. International Development Finance
Corp, which has already announced that it plans to double its investment
in low-income countries starting in October, and the [[Access
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} initiative, which
[[focus]{.underline}]{.mark}es [[on boosting U.S.-African partnerships
in developing sub-Saharan Africa's]{.underline}]{.mark} information and
communications technology ([[ICT]{.underline}]{.mark}) infrastructure.

Prosper Africa represents a step forward in U.S.-Africa trade and
investment relations along two main lines. First, Prosper Africa
signifies a unique attempt to effectively and permanently formalize the
coordination of all relevant executive agencies to accelerate trade and
investment with Africa. As such, it is a pioneering initiative that
aligns with the Trump administration's focus on "making deals" and
conducting relations in a business-like manner. It is also an
acknowledgement of African countries' tremendous business potential.

MAKING AMERICA GREATER THAN CHINA AND OTHER PARTNERS IN AFRICA?

While Prosper Africa is promising, its impact will probably not be
strong enough to counterbalance China's unique influence in the region.
China's success in doing business on the continent has been driven by
its high and diverse financial flows (a complex mix of concessional
loans, grants, aid, market loans, etc.) to Africa: Investment from China
rose twofold between 2010 and 2016. President Xi Jinping committed an
additional \$60 billion in broad and diverse financing---including \$10
billion reserved for Chinese buying of African goods, as well as
concessional loans, among other things---last September. High-level
Chinese officials, especially Xi, have pushed for strong diplomatic
relationships with African leaders.

In contrast, U.S. investment has barely increased since 2010, and
President Trump has yet to make an official state visit to any African
country.

China's way of doing business makes it the largest trading partner of
several African countries---particularly resource-rich countries like
South Sudan, Angola, Eritrea, and the Gambia---and the total volume of
two-way trade between China and Africa exceeds \$200 billion. [[The
Chinese "One Belt, One Road" initiative has taken
flight]{.underline}.]{.mark} China has backed up its claims to increase
development financing and cancel or reschedule debt, canceling \$1
billion in debt in Eastern Africa alone between 2000 and 2018.

In addition to China, other countries have been increasing their
economic ties with the African continent: Since 2017, Africa's top three
trading partners have included China, India, and France. Successful
examples of investment and business partnerships from these partners can
constitute a goal for the Prosper Africa initiative. Emerging trade
agreements are putting the U.S. at a disadvantage as they edge the U.S.
out. For instance, 41 African countries have signed Economic Partnership
Agreements with the European Union. The EU and Africa are even talking
about creating a continent-to-continent free trade agreement---an
initiative that makers Prosper Africa seem modest at best.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US POLICYMAKERS AND BUSINESS LEADERS

With this increasing competition as well as the needs of the continent
in mind, the administrators of [[Prosper Africa
should]{.underline}]{.mark} consider the following strategies:

U.S. investment should be increased substantially and focus on areas
that will foster industrial development and greater intra-African trade
to create sustainable growth that is less dependent on commodity exports
elsewhere (e.g., infrastructure related to transport, energy, water, and
information and communication technology, or ICTs) and in which the U.S.
has a strong competitive advantage compared to China (ICTs and
cybersecurity, among others). Indeed, economic development cannot happen
without massive investments---especially in infrastructure---that
further unlock the private sector. Right now, Africa is only able to
fund about a third of the \$130 billion to \$170 billion needed to
finance its infrastructure per year. The Program on Infrastructure
Development in Africa and the recently inaugurated Africa Investment
Forum provide a comprehensive list of projects.

[[The U.S. should embrace the]{.underline}]{.mark} African Continental
Free Trade Area ([[AfCFTA]{.underline}]{.mark}). If the AfCFTA is
successfully implemented,the combined consumer and [[business spending
in 2030 will be \$6.7 trillion and the continent's manufacturing
sector]{.underline}]{.mark} is projected to double in size, with an
annual output of \$1 trillion by 2025 and over 14 new million jobs.
Currently, the AfCFTA, along with Agenda 2063, is considered by Africans
to be the most important tool for fostering their economic prosperity,
accelerating industrialization, and providing jobs to the youth. Thus
far, the European Union, China, and other partners have supported the
AfCFTA, but the United States is still hesitant, which seems to be in
contradiction to one of the goals of Prosper Africa: to empower Africa
to drive its own growth. The U.S. should instead produce a statement
supporting the AfCFTA and should consider strategies for empowering the
AfCFTA secretariat, such as capacity building and financing.

[[The U.S. should **reinvigorate** its efforts towards governance and
private sector engagement, education, and
training]{.underline}]{.mark}---critical long-lived, but currently
waning, components of U.S. engagement abroad. Many sub-Saharan African
countries lack mechanisms for effectively and appropriately engaging
private sector capabilities, experiences, and interests in policymaking
processes. For instance, in some cases private sector interests are able
to capture policymaking, leading to cronyism and corruption. In other
cases, the private sector is shut out of the policymaking process
altogether, and policy is thus not attuned to its needs. As a result,
[[the cost of doing business in Africa is the highest in the
world]{.mark}, and the continent receives the lowest net inflows of
foreign direct investment globally. [The U.S. could make a difference by
supporting research on how countries can better balance and integrate
the private sector]{.mark} in order to promote inclusive, participatory
governance, thus **[reducing]{.mark}**]{.underline} both perceived and
real [[**risks** to doing business in Africa]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### US soft power is key to stop Chinese and Russian projects that are detrimental to African development

**[Einashe 19]{.underline}** \[Ismail Einashe is a journalist and
writer. He has written for the Guardian, The Sunday Times, NBC News, the
Nation, Foreign Policy, Frieze, NPR and the New York Times, among many
other places. He sits on the editorial board of Tate Etc. the magazine

to Contain Chinese and Russian Influence.\" Pulitzer Center, 1-22-2019,
<https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/americas-new-policy-africa-attempt-contain-chinese-and-russian-influence>\]

It is easy to think that this growing threat is why the Trump
administration has ramped up its level of engagement in the Horn of
Africa, where the Somalian terror organisation is based. In December,
the U.S. unexpectedly instituted a new set of policies for the whole
continent, approved by president Donald Trump and announced by his
national security adviser John Bolton. Speaking at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington D.C., Mr Bolton said
that [[America's priorities included enhancing economic ties with
African nations and combating extremist groups]{.underline}]{.mark}.

However, [[this new approach has]{.underline}]{.mark} far less [[to do
with]{.underline}]{.mark} developing mutually beneficial economic and
security links than [[**curtailing** the ambitions of **China** and
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark} in a rapidly developing and
resource-rich territory. This much was clear when Mr Bolton accused both
China and Russia of \"deliberately and aggressively targeting their
investments in the region to gain a competitive advantage over the
United States".

China was singled out for particular criticism, with Mr Bolton stating
that it has employed bribery, opaque agreements and "strategic use of
debt" to hold African countries "captive to Beijing's wishes and
demands". By way of example, he referred to two nations: Zambia and
Djibouti.

[[Copper-rich Zambia has]{.underline}]{.mark} lately [[witnessed a wave
o]{.mark}f]{.underline} popular [[protest over its]{.underline}]{.mark}
massive [[debts]{.underline}]{.mark} and economic ties [[to
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since 2017, the strategically located east
African nation of Djibouti has been home to China's first-ever overseas
military base. It is no coincidence that it also owes 80 per cent of its
external debt to China. In September last year, concerned [[U.S.
senators accused China of engaging in "**economic warfare**"]{.mark} in
such countries]{.underline}.

Regardless of the recent reconsideration of his policies, it is worth
remembering that Mr Trump's presidency has been one of the worst in the
history of U.S.-Africa relations. In January last year, he alienated
large numbers of people by describing African nations as "s\*\*\*hole
countries". Soon after that, he threatened to withdraw aid from states
that voted against his controversial decision to move the U.S. embassy
in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. To many observers, his recent
manoeuvres look like a desperate scramble to regain waning influence in
a region where much of the goodwill traditionally extended to the U.S.
has evaporated.

More importantly, for many, increased [[U.S. engagement carries chilling
**Cold War resonances**]{.underline}]{.mark}. During that era, various
African states took clear sides in the ideological battle between
eastern communism and western capitalism. Wedged between competing
superpowers, ordinary people all too often paid a heavy price, from the
Congo crisis (1960 to 1965), to the first civil war in Chad (1965 to
1979) and the Mozambican civil war (1977 to 1992).

[[Russia took many]{.underline}]{.mark} observers **[[by
surprise]{.underline}]{.mark}** last year with its sprint [[to offer
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, military support [[and **nuclear
power**]{.underline}]{.mark} to nations such as Chad and Zimbabwe. [[It
has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[been]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly
[[active in the **war-ravaged** C]{.underline}]{.mark}entral
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}frican [[R]{.underline}]{.mark}epublic -- where,
in August last year, three Russian journalists were killed while
investigating the presence of mercenaries linked to Kremlin-backed
businessmen.

In March last year, the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov made a
high-profile visit to six African countries, including Ethiopia and
Mozambique. Mr Lavrov's trip was designed to renew Russia's economic
ties with Africa after a decades-long hiatus following the collapse of
the Soviet Union. Russia also wanted to open a military base in
Djibouti, but was rebuffed by the government of president Ismail Omar
Guelleh, "so that \[it\] is not used in the conflict in Syria".

In many ways, the new Africa programme laid out by Mr Bolton is designed
to flesh out what "America First" foreign policy will look like on the
continent. [[The U.S. has]{.mark}]{.underline} long [[**neglected**
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under Barack Obama, it was seen solely
through the prism of international security, rather than as a viable
place to invest in. [[This allowed China to project its will
**unchallenged**]{.underline}]{.mark}, laying out vast sums in loans and
on infrastructure projects in return for access to vital resources, such
as oil from Angola, copper from Zambia and cobalt from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

America's desire to limit China's economic incursions is clear and
understandable. The only problem is that it lacks the economic might to
compete with the colossal amounts of money the Asian giant has funnelled
into Africa. In fact, [[the only real advantages the U.S. has are its
**soft power** and **military expertise**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

But the current situation is not all gloom. Regardless of its
motivations or its inadequacies, the U.S. is paying real attention to
Africa for the first time in years. That renewed focus gives African
nations unprecedented opportunities to pursue their own interests,
rather than simply act as client states. [[America's drive to contain
both Russian and Chinese influence brings chances to secure foreign
investment]{.underline}]{.mark} and to leverage strategic advantages
into a more prominent presence on the world stage. And, after centuries
in the shadow of global powers, it is high time that Africa finally
found its own voice.

### 2NC -- Small Arms -- Solvency

#### Removing small arms solves -- they're the root cause of instability in Africa

**[Fleshman 11]{.underline}** \[Michael Fleshman. "Small arms in
Africa." AfricaRenewal, *UN*, December 2011,
un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2011/small-arms-africa\]

The dry rolling plains of northern [[Kenya seem an unlikely place for an
arms race]{.underline}]{.mark}. But in less than a generation the
pastoral Pokot people and their neighbours have gone from protecting
their herds with spears to outfitting their young men with cheap,
reliable and deadly automatic rifles from the war zones of Somalia,
Ethiopia and Sudan. The impact of modern military weapons on the Pokot
and surrounding communities was brought tragically home in [[early
2001]{.underline}]{.mark}, when [[Pokot **youth opened fire** on a rival
settlement, killing 47 people]{.underline}]{.mark}, burning down the
village and transforming the almost-ceremonial tradition of cattle
raiding into an occasion for human slaughter. \"Guns are changing
things,\" one young Pokot man told the Washington Post newspaper. \"The
young ones, they don\'t respect elders.\" \"If you don\'t have a
weapon,\" added another, \"your grave is open.\"

In fact, [[small arms]{.underline}]{.mark}, which include rifles,
pistols and light machine guns, [[are filling **African graves** in
ever-increasing numbers]{.underline}]{.mark} \--
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the killing fields of [[Burundi]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[D]{.underline}]{.mark}emocratic
[R]{.mark}epublic of [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ongo
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the streets of [[Lagos and
Johannesburg]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the international community
searches, so far unsuccessfully, for agreement on the regulation of the
global trade in small arms, a growing number of African countries, UN
agencies and non-governmental organizations are grappling with the human
and development consequences of gun violence and seeking to reduce both
the supply and the demand for what Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
called \"the weapons of choice for the killers of our time.\"

[[Reducing the]{.mark}]{.underline} availability and [[use of **small
arms**]{.underline}]{.mark} in places where fighting has ended [[has
become increasingly important to Africa\'s
development]{.underline}]{.mark} prospects as the number of conflicts
has increased over the past decade. The widespread abuse of weapons
diverts scarce government resources from health and education to public
security, discourages investment and economic growth, and deprives
developing countries of the skills and talents of the victims of small
arms.

Millions of light arms \-- lightweight, highly portable, and
devastatingly effective in the hands of even young or poorly trained
users \-- were shipped to Africa during the Cold War to equip
anti-colonial fighters, newly independent states and superpower proxy
forces alike. The collapse of the Soviet bloc saw a new flood of small
arms entering Africa as manufacturers put additional millions of surplus
Cold War-era weapons on the international arms market at cut-rate
prices.

Years later, these durable killing machines fight on in the hands of
insurgents, local militias, criminal organizations and ordinary people
left vulnerable to violence by ineffective policing and simmering civil
conflict. In some parts of Africa, a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault
rifle, coveted for its simplicity and firepower, can be purchased for as
little as \$6, or traded for a chicken or sack of grain. In 1999 the Red
Cross estimated that in the Somali capital of Mogadishu alone, the
city\'s 1.3 million residents possessed over a million guns \-- among an
estimated 550 mn small arms in circulation worldwide.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} widespread [[abuse of weapons
diverts]{.underline}]{.mark} scarce government [[resources from health
and education to public security, discourages investment and economic
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, and deprives developing countries of the
skills and talents of the victims of small arms.

\"The proliferation of light weapons in Africa poses a major threat to
development,\" noted Ms. Virginia Gamba, the former director of the Arms
Management Programme of the South African Institute for Security Studies
(ISS). Their low cost, ease of use and availability \"may escalate
conflicts, undermine peace agreements, intensify \[the\] violence and
impact of crime, impede economic and social development and hinder the
development of social stability, democracy and good governance.\" In
July 2001 the US government estimated that small arms are fuelling
conflicts in 22 African countries that have taken 7-8 million lives.
[[In Africa guns are]{.underline}]{.mark} not just the weapons of choice
but also **[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons of
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction.

When weapons outlast wars

The development impact of war on individuals, communities and states is
unambiguous and well documented. By its nature \-- and sometimes by
design \-- modern warfare destroys economic and social infrastructure,
uproots populations, paralyses economic activity, disrupts vital health
and education services and diverts financial resources from development
to defence.

Less well understood is the impact of small arms on development in
post-conflict situations. [[Unlike heavy weapons systems]{.mark}, which
can be costly to acquire and operate and comparatively easy to
decommission or monitor, [the end of a war **does
not**]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily bring an [[**end** to the use of
light weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}.

As Robert Muggah and Peter Bachelor, analysts for the Small Arms Survey,
a European research institute, report in a recent study, Development
Held Hostage: Assessing the Effects of Small Arms on Human Development,
\"the durability of small arms ensures that once they are present in a
country they present a continuous risk \-- especially in societies where
there are large accumulations of weapons\.... They frequently outlast
peace agreements and are taken up again in the post-conflict period\" by
criminal gangs, vigilantes, dissidents, and individuals concerned about
personal security. In areas where state security is weak or absent,
possession of a gun can be a matter of survival, either to seize food
and other vital resources or as protection from attack. In other places
the low cost and ready availability of firearms can promote what experts
call a \"culture of violence,\" where gun ownership becomes a symbol of
power and status, and gun violence a first resort for the settlement of
personal and political disputes

South Africa has suffered considerably from the misuse of small arms
since the end of apartheid in 1994, and has moved aggressively to reduce
their availability. Unlike most other African countries, [[South Africa
has a large number of small arms in **legal**
circulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, with over 4 mn guns registered to
private, primarily white, owners at the end of 1999. In common with
countries bordering conflict areas in West and East Africa, however,
[South Africa has also suffered from the illegal influx from
neighbouring states]{.underline} of weapons that have outlasted the wars
they were intended to fight.

In the 1970s, the apartheid government began supplying thousands of tons
of arms and ammunition to its domestic and regional allies for the
defence of white minority rule. An estimated 30 tonnes of guns and
explosives were smuggled into the country by the anti-apartheid
movements, which also left arms stockpiles at their base camps in
surrounding countries. As many as 4 mn weapons from various sources have
illegally found their way into the hands of South African civilians. The
presence of so many weapons outside government control has overwhelmed
law enforcement efforts, contributed to crime and public insecurity,
hampered economic growth and caused tragic and avoidable deaths and
injuries.

Measuring the effects

Assessing the peacetime impact of small arms on South Africa and other
African countries is difficult. [[Many countries lack the capacity to
collect]{.underline}]{.mark} and analyze [[data about the use of small
arms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, many of the greatest costs to
development, such as deferred investment, reduced economic activity and
lost productivity due to injury and insecurity, are indirect, and
therefore hard to measure.

One of the best indicators, said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the World
Health Organization (WHO), Injuries and Violence Prevention Department,
are public health records. But particularly in developing regions like
Africa, WHO cautions in its 2001 report Small Arms and Global Health,
\"data on the impact of small arms on the health of individuals are far
from complete.\" Statistics are vital for the development of effective
strategies to meet the medical challenges of guns, he noted, but
[[donors are often unwilling to fund data collection as part of health
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Globally, WHO put the number of violent deaths from all causes in 1998
at 2.3 million. Several hundred thousand of these are believed to be
gunshot victims: 42 per cent as a result of suicide, 32 per cent by
murder and 26 per cent by war. The study found a correlation between gun
violence and development: [[death rates]{.underline}]{.mark} in low and
middle-income countries, [[at 42 per 100,000
people]{.underline}]{.mark}, were more than double the 17 per 100,000
rate found in high-income countries. Many [[hundreds of
thousands]{.underline}]{.mark} more people survive gun injuries, but
[[require costly medical care]{.underline}]{.mark} and often suffer
permanent physical and emotional disabilities. The absence of
sophisticated emergency medical facilities, however, means that far more
gunshot injuries prove fatal to victims in developing countries than in
the industrialized North.

The direct cost can be high. A 1997 study of 1,000 gunshot victims in
South Africa put the total cost of hospital treatment at nearly R30 mn
(then \$6.5 mn). The indirect impact of gun violence on public health
systems, asserts WHO, also is huge. Treating large numbers of patients
with gunshot wounds \"has a draining effect on basic health care and
diverts much-needed resources from other health and social services.\"

Crime rates rising

Crime statistics can also provide a measurement of the impact of small
arms on development. Because apartheid-era crime reports in South Africa
are considered unreliable, ISS researchers analyzed post-apartheid
police records and reported a \"marked increase\" in the use of firearms
to commit murder, from 41.5 per cent of homicides in 1994 to 49.3 per
cent in 1998, even as the overall number of murders decreased. The use
of small arms in robberies also increased significantly, from 51,000
incidents in 1996 to 69,500 in 1998, although the overall number of
robberies involving weapons of all kinds increased only marginally.

The increase, the analysts argue, \"shows that more [[criminals are
arming **themselves**]{.underline}]{.mark}\" and that \"[[**access** to
firearms has become easier]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to previous
years.\" By 2000 the South African government found that homicide,
primarily involving firearms, was the leading cause of death among young
men aged 15-21 and that gunshots from all causes (murder, suicide and
accidents) were the single largest cause of non-natural death in the
country.

The death and injury of so many young people has profound consequences
for development \-- reducing the number of educated people entering the
work force, diverting family and social resources into the care of those
disabled by gun violence and forcing the government to redirect funding
from social services to law enforcement. Last year, for example, South
Africa spent \$1.96 bn on law enforcement and \$1.56 bn on health.

In Kenya, the [[illegal influx of small arms]{.underline}]{.mark} from
surrounding states [[appears to be **fuelling
violence**]{.underline}]{.mark} far from the volatile northern border
areas. The increased availability of weapons in Nairobi, for example,
may be a factor in the rising number of murders and the use of violence
in burglaries, although Kenyan police report that the number of reported
robberies themselves has declined. A recent survey by the UN Centre for
Human Settlements (Habitat) and the Kenyan government found that 75 per
cent of city residents felt insecure at night despite an increased
police presence in high crime areas.

#### Small arms and light weapons kill thousands of people in Africa which inhibits aid projects [AND]{.underline} they end up in the hands of the Boko Haram

**[Guardian Nigeria News 18]{.underline}** \[The Guardian is an

Although arms proliferation is a global issue, available data on Small
Arms and Light Weapons ([[SALW]{.underline}]{.mark}) show that out of
the 640 million circulating globally, it is [[estimated that 100 million
are found in Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}, about 30 million in
sub-Saharan Africa and eight million in West Africa, alone.

The majority of these SALW about 59% are in the hands of civilians, 38%
are owned by government armed forces, 2.8 % by police and 0.2% by armed
groups.

This has implications as African countries have experienced direct,
indirect and consequential impacts of weapons proliferation: [[thousands
of people]{.underline}]{.mark}, both civilians and military, [[are
**killed** or **injured** every year]{.underline}]{.mark} on the
continent.

[[Even when death]{.underline}]{.mark} or injury [[is
avoided]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[SALW prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration
[[and misuse can impact a]{.underline} [community]{.underline}]{.mark},
country or region's landscape. Indeed [[illegal arms have led
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[rising]{.mark}]{.underline} rate [[of
**criminality**]{.underline}]{.mark} and citizens are endangered. Also,
[[the threat]{.underline}]{.mark} and use [[of SALW]{.underline}
[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} the delivery of [[**humanitarian** and
**economic aid** and contribute to]{.underline}]{.mark} refugee and
internally displaced persons (**[[IDP]{.underline}]{.mark}**). The
phenomenon is indeed an impediment to the socio-economic development of
countries in Africa.

So, it is obvious that despite the efforts of security agencies,
[[borders of African countries are **porous**, allowing illicit arms
trafficking]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has resulted in the proliferation
of SALW.

Events in the last years show that Nigeria is a source/origin, transit
point and destination of trafficked SALW. The interception of a
consignment of pump action rifles alleged to have originated from China
through Turkey, along the Mile 2 -- Apapa Road, Lagos by the operatives
of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS); and the discovery of an illegal arms
factory in Agbada, Nenwe in Aninri Local Government Area of Enugu State
during the first quarter of 2011 by the State Security Service (SSS),
Enugu State Command, are examples of how endangered Nigeria is.

In addition, [[Nigeria's secret service]{.underline}]{.mark} in October
2010 [[intercepted]{.underline}]{.mark} the shipment of 13 [[containers
filled with **rocket launchers**, **grenades** and **other explosives**
and **ammunitions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The cargo was said to be on its way to Gambia and had begun its journey
from a port in Iran. Also, sometime in June 2009, there were several
media reports that security operatives impounded a Ukrainian plane,
fully loaded with guns and ammunitions when it made a technical landing
at Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport at about 2:00.a.m on
Wednesday 17th June.

The unresolved murders of high profile citizens like Chief Bola Ige,
Funsho Williams, A.K. Dikibo, Marshal Harry and many others seemed to
have had their roots in this jungle-like life in which Nigerians live.
They have also fuelled communal clashes, religious and ethnic crises in
Ife, Jos, Kaduna and Taraba, as well as farmers-herdsmen conflicts in
Benue and Nasarwa states, in which hundreds of lives have been lost.

Similarly, [[the number of recovered arms from
robbers]{.underline}]{.mark}; not to mention the lingering militancy,
terrorism, herdsmen and farmers' conflict and kidnapping further
[[expose the **magnitude** of the influx of illegal
arms]{.underline}]{.mark} in the country. This situation is frightening
and raises serious questions about the security of lives and property in
the country.

Therefore, [[it is **heart-warming** that the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Federal [[Government]{.underline}]{.mark} has risen up to the occasion
by [[set]{.underline}]{.mark}ting [[up a committee to
transform]{.underline}]{.mark} the Presidential Committee on Small Arms
and Light Weapons ([[PRESCOM]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[into]{.underline}]{.mark} a National Commission
([[NATCOM]{.underline}]{.mark}). [[This decision is meant to fast-track
the process of fighting against prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration [[of
arms]{.underline}]{.mark} not only in Nigeria but also in
member-countries of the Economic Community of West African States,
particularly [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} of the regional dimension
[[of the problem of **Boko Haram**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

the president's national security adviser, the government is selling
mining rights for gold and diamonds at a fraction of their worth to hire
trainers and buy arms from Moscow. [[Russia is seeking to ensconce
itself on **NATO's southern flank**]{.underline}]{.mark} by helping a
former general in Libya fight for control over his government and vast
oil market.

Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, brought in Russian mercenaries
in January to help shore up his rule against nationwide protests. And
last spring, [[five sub-Saharan African countries]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania --- [[appealed to
Moscow to help their overtaxed militaries]{.underline}]{.mark} and
security services [[combat the **I**]{.underline}]{.mark}slamic
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate [[and **Al
Qaeda**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Russia, entrenched in Africa during the Cold War's violent East-West
rivalry, largely retreated from the continent after the collapse of the
Soviet Union. But in the past two years, [[Moscow has **rekindled**
relations with Soviet-era clients]{.mark} like Mozambique and
Angola]{.underline}, and forged new ties with other countries. President
Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will host a summit meeting between Moscow
and African countries later this year.

Expanding Moscow's military sway on the continent reflects Mr. Putin's
broader vision of returning Russia to its former glory. But it also
illustrates [[Russia's opportunistic strategy to carve out logistical
and political gains in Africa wherever and whenever it
can]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"Russia is also a growing challenge and has taken a more militaristic
approach in Africa," Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of the
Pentagon's Africa Command, told Congress in March.

The murder of three Russian journalists by unknown assailants in the
Central African Republic, a former French colony, last year drew
attention to the Kremlin's return to the continent.

The journalists were investigating the activities of the Wagner Group, a
private military force founded by a former Russian intelligence officer
and linked to an associate of Mr. Putin. Russia said in a statement last
year that 175 instructors --- believed by Pentagon officials and Western
analysts to be employed by the Wagner Group --- have trained more than
1,000 Central African Republic troops. The country has been mired in
violence since 2012.

"Moscow and its private military contractors are arming some of the
region's weakest governments and backing the continent's autocratic
rulers," said Judd Devermont, director of the Africa Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "This
engagement threatens to exacerbate current conflict zones."

Late last year, the [[White House **revamped** its economic and security
policies toward Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[including plans to
increase]{.underline}]{.mark} access to [[financing for
projects]{.underline}]{.mark} on the continent --- and administration
officials have fanned out on the continent to drum up support for the
plan. In March, in Luanda, Angola, John J. Sullivan, the deputy
secretary of state, warned that "[[Russia often utilizes
coercive]{.underline}]{.mark}, corrupt, and covert [[means to attempt to
influence sovereign states]{.mark}, including their security and
economic partnerships]{.underline}."

Under the Trump administration, the Pentagon has shifted focus to
confronting global threats, largely from China and Russia, and away from
fighting terrorist organizations. In December, John R.
[[Bolton]{.underline}]{.mark}, President Trump's national security
adviser, [[described the new strategy in Africa as a "**great power**"
competition and **counterbalance** to China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Kremlin, Mr. Bolton said at the time, "continues to sell arms and
energy in exchange for votes at the United Nations --- votes that keep
strongmen in power, undermine peace and security and run counter to the
best interests of the African people."

But many African nations appeared unconvinced. Some two dozen abstained
in December on a motion by the United Nations General Assembly that
condemned Russia's annexation of Crimea and urged Moscow to withdraw its
troops from the Ukranian peninsula.

The United States military has a relatively light footprint across
Africa.

About 6,000 United States troops and 1,000 Defense Department civilians
or contractors work on a variety of missions throughout Africa, mainly
training and conducting exercises with local armies.

[[Moscow cannot compete with American **foreign aid** or
China's]{.underline}]{.mark} sweeping [[investment
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} on the continent. But analysts said Russia
is driven by both opportunity and necessity to advance in Africa.

Russia is seeking more strategic bases for its troops, including at
Libyan ports on the Mediterranean Sea and at naval logistics centers in
Eritrea and Sudan on the Red Sea, according to an analysis by the
Institute for the Study of War, a research organization in Washington.

Last year, Russia signed agreements on military cooperation with Guinea,
Burkina Faso, Burundi and Madagascar. Separately, Mali's government has
sought help from Moscow to combat terrorism, despite the thousands of
French troops and United Nations peacekeepers who are stationed in the
country.

Thirteen percent of Russia's total arms exports in 2017 were sent to
Africa, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. [[Russia is courting arms deals across Africa by promising
timely deliveries and flexible terms]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[a
strategy that]{.underline}]{.mark} analysts [[said
is]{.underline}]{.mark} most [[successful when pitched at states that
have few alternatives to develop defense agreements with other partners
because they have been isolated by the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and other countries in the West.

### 2AC -- Arms Sales Key

#### Aff solves-- weapons are the root cause of instability in Africa 

**[Fleshman 11]{.underline}** \[Michael Fleshman. "Small arms in
Africa." AfricaRenewal, *UN*, December 2011,
un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2011/small-arms-africa\]

The dry rolling plains of northern [[Kenya seem an unlikely place for an
arms race]{.underline}]{.mark}. But in less than a generation the
pastoral Pokot people and their neighbours have gone from protecting
their herds with spears to outfitting their young men with cheap,
reliable and deadly automatic rifles from the war zones of Somalia,
Ethiopia and Sudan. The impact of modern military weapons on the Pokot
and surrounding communities was brought tragically home in [[early
2001]{.underline}]{.mark}, when [[Pokot **youth opened fire** on a rival
settlement, killing 47 people]{.underline}]{.mark}, burning down the
village and transforming the almost-ceremonial tradition of cattle
raiding into an occasion for human slaughter. \"Guns are changing
things,\" one young Pokot man told the Washington Post newspaper. \"The
young ones, they don\'t respect elders.\" \"If you don\'t have a
weapon,\" added another, \"your grave is open.\"

In fact, [[small arms]{.underline}]{.mark}, which include rifles,
pistols and light machine guns, [[are filling **African graves** in
ever-increasing numbers]{.underline}]{.mark} \--
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the killing fields of [[Burundi]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[D]{.underline}]{.mark}emocratic
[R]{.mark}epublic of [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ongo
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the streets of [[Lagos and
Johannesburg]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the international community
searches, so far unsuccessfully, for agreement on the regulation of the
global trade in small arms, a growing number of African countries, UN
agencies and non-governmental organizations are grappling with the human
and development consequences of gun violence and seeking to reduce both
the supply and the demand for what Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
called \"the weapons of choice for the killers of our time.\"

[[Reducing the]{.mark}]{.underline} availability and [[use of **small
arms**]{.underline}]{.mark} in places where fighting has ended [[has
become increasingly important to Africa\'s
development]{.underline}]{.mark} prospects as the number of conflicts
has increased over the past decade. The widespread abuse of weapons
diverts scarce government resources from health and education to public
security, discourages investment and economic growth, and deprives
developing countries of the skills and talents of the victims of small
arms.

Millions of light arms \-- lightweight, highly portable, and
devastatingly effective in the hands of even young or poorly trained
users \-- were shipped to Africa during the Cold War to equip
anti-colonial fighters, newly independent states and superpower proxy
forces alike. The collapse of the Soviet bloc saw a new flood of small
arms entering Africa as manufacturers put additional millions of surplus
Cold War-era weapons on the international arms market at cut-rate
prices.

Years later, these durable killing machines fight on in the hands of
insurgents, local militias, criminal organizations and ordinary people
left vulnerable to violence by ineffective policing and simmering civil
conflict. In some parts of Africa, a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault
rifle, coveted for its simplicity and firepower, can be purchased for as
little as \$6, or traded for a chicken or sack of grain. In 1999 the Red
Cross estimated that in the Somali capital of Mogadishu alone, the
city\'s 1.3 million residents possessed over a million guns \-- among an
estimated 550 mn small arms in circulation worldwide.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} widespread [[abuse of weapons
diverts]{.underline}]{.mark} scarce government [[resources from health
and education to public security, discourages investment and economic
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, and deprives developing countries of the
skills and talents of the victims of small arms.

\"The proliferation of light weapons in Africa poses a major threat to
development,\" noted Ms. Virginia Gamba, the former director of the Arms
Management Programme of the South African Institute for Security Studies
(ISS). Their low cost, ease of use and availability \"may escalate
conflicts, undermine peace agreements, intensify \[the\] violence and
impact of crime, impede economic and social development and hinder the
development of social stability, democracy and good governance.\" In
July 2001 the US government estimated that small arms are fuelling
conflicts in 22 African countries that have taken 7-8 million lives.
[[In Africa guns are]{.underline}]{.mark} not just the weapons of choice
but also **[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons of

When weapons outlast wars

The development impact of war on individuals, communities and states is
unambiguous and well documented. By its nature \-- and sometimes by
design \-- modern warfare destroys economic and social infrastructure,
uproots populations, paralyses economic activity, disrupts vital health
and education services and diverts financial resources from development
to defence.

Less well understood is the impact of small arms on development in
post-conflict situations. [[Unlike heavy weapons systems]{.mark}, which
can be costly to acquire and operate and comparatively easy to
decommission or monitor, [the end of a war **does
not**]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily bring an [[**end** to the use of
light weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}.

As Robert Muggah and Peter Bachelor, analysts for the Small Arms Survey,
a European research institute, report in a recent study, Development
Held Hostage: Assessing the Effects of Small Arms on Human Development,
\"the durability of small arms ensures that once they are present in a
country they present a continuous risk \-- especially in societies where
there are large accumulations of weapons\.... They frequently outlast
peace agreements and are taken up again in the post-conflict period\" by
criminal gangs, vigilantes, dissidents, and individuals concerned about
personal security. In areas where state security is weak or absent,
possession of a gun can be a matter of survival, either to seize food
and other vital resources or as protection from attack. In other places
the low cost and ready availability of firearms can promote what experts
call a \"culture of violence,\" where gun ownership becomes a symbol of
power and status, and gun violence a first resort for the settlement of
personal and political disputes

South Africa has suffered considerably from the misuse of small arms
since the end of apartheid in 1994, and has moved aggressively to reduce
their availability. Unlike most other African countries, [[South Africa
has a large number of small arms in **legal**
circulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, with over 4 mn guns registered to
private, primarily white, owners at the end of 1999. In common with
countries bordering conflict areas in West and East Africa, however,
[South Africa has also suffered from the illegal influx from
neighbouring states]{.underline} of weapons that have outlasted the wars
they were intended to fight.

In the 1970s, the apartheid government began supplying thousands of tons
of arms and ammunition to its domestic and regional allies for the
defence of white minority rule. An estimated 30 tonnes of guns and
explosives were smuggled into the country by the anti-apartheid
movements, which also left arms stockpiles at their base camps in
surrounding countries. As many as 4 mn weapons from various sources have
illegally found their way into the hands of South African civilians. The
presence of so many weapons outside government control has overwhelmed
law enforcement efforts, contributed to crime and public insecurity,
hampered economic growth and caused tragic and avoidable deaths and
injuries.

Measuring the effects

Assessing the peacetime impact of small arms on South Africa and other
African countries is difficult. [[Many countries lack the capacity to
collect]{.underline}]{.mark} and analyze [[data about the use of small
arms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, many of the greatest costs to
development, such as deferred investment, reduced economic activity and
lost productivity due to injury and insecurity, are indirect, and
therefore hard to measure.

One of the best indicators, said Dr. Etienne Krug, director of the World
Health Organization (WHO), Injuries and Violence Prevention Department,
are public health records. But particularly in developing regions like
Africa, WHO cautions in its 2001 report Small Arms and Global Health,
\"data on the impact of small arms on the health of individuals are far
from complete.\" Statistics are vital for the development of effective
strategies to meet the medical challenges of guns, he noted, but
[[donors are often unwilling to fund data collection as part of health
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Globally, WHO put the number of violent deaths from all causes in 1998
at 2.3 million. Several hundred thousand of these are believed to be
gunshot victims: 42 per cent as a result of suicide, 32 per cent by
murder and 26 per cent by war. The study found a correlation between gun
violence and development: [[death rates]{.underline}]{.mark} in low and
middle-income countries, [[at 42 per 100,000
people]{.underline}]{.mark}, were more than double the 17 per 100,000
rate found in high-income countries. Many [[hundreds of
thousands]{.underline}]{.mark} more people survive gun injuries, but
[[require costly medical care]{.underline}]{.mark} and often suffer
permanent physical and emotional disabilities. The absence of
sophisticated emergency medical facilities, however, means that far more
gunshot injuries prove fatal to victims in developing countries than in
the industrialized North.

The direct cost can be high. A 1997 study of 1,000 gunshot victims in
South Africa put the total cost of hospital treatment at nearly R30 mn
(then \$6.5 mn). The indirect impact of gun violence on public health
systems, asserts WHO, also is huge. Treating large numbers of patients
with gunshot wounds \"has a draining effect on basic health care and
diverts much-needed resources from other health and social services.\"

Crime rates rising

Crime statistics can also provide a measurement of the impact of small
arms on development. Because apartheid-era crime reports in South Africa
are considered unreliable, ISS researchers analyzed post-apartheid
police records and reported a \"marked increase\" in the use of firearms
to commit murder, from 41.5 per cent of homicides in 1994 to 49.3 per
cent in 1998, even as the overall number of murders decreased. The use
of small arms in robberies also increased significantly, from 51,000
incidents in 1996 to 69,500 in 1998, although the overall number of
robberies involving weapons of all kinds increased only marginally.

The increase, the analysts argue, \"shows that more [[criminals are
arming **themselves**]{.underline}]{.mark}\" and that \"[[**access** to
firearms has become easier]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to previous
years.\" By 2000 the South African government found that homicide,
primarily involving firearms, was the leading cause of death among young
men aged 15-21 and that gunshots from all causes (murder, suicide and
accidents) were the single largest cause of non-natural death in the
country.

The death and injury of so many young people has profound consequences
for development \-- reducing the number of educated people entering the
work force, diverting family and social resources into the care of those
disabled by gun violence and forcing the government to redirect funding
from social services to law enforcement. Last year, for example, South
Africa spent \$1.96 bn on law enforcement and \$1.56 bn on health.

In Kenya, the [[illegal influx of small arms]{.underline}]{.mark} from
surrounding states [[appears to be **fuelling
violence**]{.underline}]{.mark} far from the volatile northern border
areas. The increased availability of weapons in Nairobi, for example,
may be a factor in the rising number of murders and the use of violence
in burglaries, although Kenyan police report that the number of reported
robberies themselves has declined. A recent survey by the UN Centre for
Human Settlements (Habitat) and the Kenyan government found that 75 per
cent of city residents felt insecure at night despite an increased
police presence in high crime areas.

The US government, through its Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs, Ambassador Tibor Nagy, and the Assistant US Trade
Representative for Africa, Ms Constance Hamilton, said this on Tuesday
during a telephone press briefing on the forthcoming 2019 AGOA Forum.

Signed into law by a former US President Bill Clinton in May 2000,

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- Aid Bad

#### Foreign aid actually hurts Africa

- Makes the rich richer

- Makes the poor poorer

- Boosts corruption

- Discourages development

So, richer governments are judged by it and famous faces don't stop
campaigning in plead for it but [[foreign aid doesn't]{.mark} seem to be
[show]{.mark}ing [any]{.mark} significant [progress to alleviate
poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}, in African countries at least, and in
Sub-Saharan Africa more particularly: home to the largest portion on the
world's "bottom million" in extreme poverty. [Since the 1950s
traditional development economics has been dominated by the idea that
large donations is the solution to the savings gap in developing
countries but evidence shows that **large influxes of [foreign aid can
end up doing more harm than good]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

An analysis of the economic growth in Asia over the past decades, which
has received little foreign aid in comparison to Africa, is a good
starting point. Reports from the World Bank show that out of the 700
million people who were pulled out of poverty between 1981 and 2010, 627
million of them were in China. That leaves us with 73 million throughout
the rest of the world. In other words, 89.6% were from China, giving us
a clear indication that foreign aid isn't the answer. Like Jeffrey Sachs
, I thought that foreign aid was the way forward when it comes to
eliminating extreme poverty but since the 2000s the "big push" theory
has been subject to heated debate highlighting the negative consequences
of aid which seem to have left developing countries in a worse place
than before. Here is why and here is how changes can be made to see real
progress.

Let's focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. [We hear about all these
efforts]{.underline} but [when we take a look at the statistics of
foreign aid budgets to Chad, Angola or Nigeria , the level of progress
suddenly appears to be very low in comparison to the huge sums
received.]{.underline} [[The continent]{.underline}]{.mark} as a whole
[[receives]{.mark} roughly [\$50 billion]{.mark}]{.underline} of
international assistance [[annually]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet, [[instead
of]{.mark} drastically [improving]{.mark} the [living conditions]{.mark}
of the 600 million people who live below the poverty line, [this aid
**makes the rich richer, the poor poorer** ]{.mark}**and [hinders
economic growth in the region]{.mark}**, [not to mention
**catalysing**]{.mark} **the vicious cycle of
[corruption]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Official Development Aid (ODA) is the official financing that is
distributed among developing countries with the aim of promoting
economic development and welfare in these countries. The money that
floods into Africa comes not only from individual
government-to-government aid programs but also international development
programs such as the World Bank and the IMF, which act as a channelling
intermediate between the donor governments and receiving governments.

FOREIGN AID IS SYNONYMOUS WITH PROMOTION OF CORRUPTION AND DEPENDENCE

[[Aid **strengthens corruption in countries** where it is already
widespread]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Unfortunately this is the case for
many of the countries that make up Sub-Saharan
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. The largest recipients of foreign aid are
in Sub-Saharan Africa, which happens to be where the world's lowest
ranked countries in many areas of governance are, especially in terms of
corruption, according to Transparency International. This shows that
[[foreign aid]{.mark} simply [reinforces the amount of resources
available to]{.mark} already [corrupt]{.mark} specific [elite]{.mark}
groups of people, thus [tipping or keeping the balance of power into the
hands of the executive branch]{.mark} of government. [There is a clear
correlation between increased aid and]{.mark} statistically significant
[increase in corruption]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The money is]{.mark} not distributed evenly among the population or
used to promote growth and to help the poor but is **instead [used on
military equipment, white elephant projects]{.mark}, dishonest
procurements, [etc]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is [also used by leaders
who are short of time with policies and want to achieve them
quickly]{.underline}, i.e. : increasing the size of the government with
civil servants (who don't necessarily contribute anything more to the
system or development) to cut down the unemployment rate.

Another consequence is aid dependence. [[These countries have become
used to receiving]{.mark} such [large sums of money]{.mark} [that they
don't promote local business because they have "free" money]{.mark} at
their disposal instead]{.underline}. This prevents any form of
improvement in terms of human development and per capita income.

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- Prosper Africa Bad

#### Prosper Africa makes nonaligned countries pick sides [AND]{.underline} Trump has no intention of [helping]{.underline} Africa

Economic Policy, and a visiting fellow with the Center for Global

worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28036/trump-s-prosper-africa-strategy-is-fixated-on-a-cold-war-like-view-of-china\]

During the Cold War, [[American policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}
frequently [[push]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[nonaligned countries to take
sides]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Central Intelligence Agency fomented
coups against governments that flirted with communism and the Soviet
Union, or that just drifted too far to the left for comfort. The State
Department threatened to cut aid flows to countries that voted too often
against U.S. priorities at the United Nations. Could [[sub-Saharan
Africa find itself caught in]{.underline}]{.mark} the middle again if
[[a cold war with China breaks out]{.underline}]{.mark}?

In a speech at the Heritage Foundation last December, President Donald
Trump's hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, launched a new
initiative called "[[Prosper Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}" that he said
[[was aimed at promoting trade and commercial ties]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[to the benefit]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[both]{.underline}]{.mark}
the United States and Africa." But there are a number of reasons for
[[African governments]{.underline}]{.mark} to be [[concerned about what
the admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[really has in
mind]{.underline}]{.mark}.

First of all, Bolton cast [[the goal of increased economic
engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} as something necessary for "safeguarding
the economic independence of African states and protecting U.S. national
security interests," [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[something helpful
for African economic development]{.underline}]{.mark}. He pointed to the
growing influence of "great power competitors," China and Russia, which
he suggested were investing in Africa mainly "to gain a competitive
advantage over the United States." While there are certainly valid
concerns about some of China's foreign aid and lending practices in
Africa and other developing countries, [[African governments
have]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[welcomed Chinese
aid]{.mark}]{.underline} and investment. It's not at all clear they
would agree that this is a competition where they must choose one side
or the other.

A second reason to [[be skeptical of how seriously this
admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[takes the goal of helping
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} develop is the low level of U.S. engagement
to date. President Donald [[Trump has **not visited** the
continent]{.underline}]{.mark}; his wife and daughter have in trips
heavy on photo ops but light on policy substance. Secretary of Commerce
Wilbur [[Ross]{.underline}]{.mark}---hardly the most dynamic member of
the Cabinet---was supposed to represent the administration last month at
the U.S.-Africa Business Summit in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique,
where details of the Prosper Africa initiative were announced. But he
[[cancelled at the last minute because of a]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[scheduling conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}," according to his office,
sending Deputy Secretary of Commerce Karen Dunn Kelley instead.

By contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping has visited Africa multiple
times and has welcomed a stream of African officials to Beijing. Russian
President Vladimir Putin will host 50 African leaders at a summit in
Sochi later this year. Gyude Moore, a former minister of public works in
Liberia (he's now my colleague at the Center for Global Development),
called the lack of Cabinet-level U.S. participation at the Maputo
meeting insulting.

There are a number of reasons for African governments to be concerned
about what the Trump administration really has in mind.

Finally, another reason to question the White House's intentions with
respect to trade with Africa is [[Trump's view that trade policy is a
zero-sum game]{.underline}]{.mark}: If another country wins, the United
States must lose, and vice versa. Indeed, before getting to the mutual
benefit part of his speech last December, Bolton asserted that [[the
admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration[['s new Africa strategy would remain
true to Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} "central [[**campaign promise** to
put]{.underline}]{.mark} the interests of the [[American people first,
both at **home** and **abroad**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

So it should be no surprise that when he discussed trade, Bolton
emphasized American jobs and exports to Africa. He said that the
administration wants to pursue "modern, comprehensive trade
agreements... that ensure fair and reciprocal exchange." In recent
congressional testimony, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer
also reiterated the administration's goal of negotiating a bilateral
trade agreement with an African country that could become a model for
others. Negotiators for a little country, negotiating with a big country
like the United States, might wonder just what reciprocity means in that
context.

If more than two decades of history is any guide, negotiating a trade
deal with the United States will mean more or less accepting whatever
text American negotiators put in front of their counterparts, including
onerous demands for strict intellectual property protections that could
increase prices for drugs and agricultural inputs. Negotiating with one
country at a time is also problematic because most African countries are
party to one or more regional communities, which they are stitching
together in a single, continent-wide free trade agreement that just
formally entered into force. The continent---home to a large number of
small economies, many of them landlocked---desperately needs more
regional integration to increase its competitiveness by lowering
transportation and other costs of trade and achieving economies of
scale.

Beyond these problematic trade plans, what else is in the
administration's Prosper Africa initiative? Its second stated aim is to
engage the private sector and double U.S. trade with and investment in
Africa. According to Kelley's remarks in Maputo, two of the three
strands of the program are aimed at helping American companies find and
close deals across Africa by streamlining and better coordinating U.S.
government activities that provide information, financing and risk

[[sounds like it might involve a little arm-twisting if African

Helping African countries improve the investment climate, which is
Prosper Africa's third strand, and connecting American investors to
opportunities on the continent, are worthy---and indeed
longstanding---goals. Overall, however, the initiative appears to be a
mix of existing programs in shiny new packaging, and with little new
money. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} \$50 million proposed [[budget for
Prosper Africa is a **drop in the bucket** compared to the

to negotiate bilateral trade agreements country by country would
undermine the regional integration that is needed for the continent's
development.

[[AfCFTA got a]{.underline}]{.mark} late [[boost when
Nigeria]{.underline}]{.mark}, the largest African economy,
[[agreed]{.underline}]{.mark} Sunday [[to sign]{.underline}]{.mark} on,
but that's [[**no assurance** that]{.underline}]{.mark} the bid for
[**[a single unified market]{.mark}** [will be a
**success**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Every African
nation]{.underline}]{.mark} but Eritrea [[has
signed]{.underline}]{.mark} the general agreement, [[but
only]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[**half** have actually ratified
it]{.underline}]{.mark}.

AfCFTA is designed to address lagging intra-regional trade, which
accounted for only 17 percent of all African exports in 2017, according
to Reuters. By eliminating tariffs on most goods, AfCFTA's signatories
hope it will not only kick that rate up, but also spur local production
and strengthen supply chains.

Its [[critics note that **it will not improve** road or rail links,
bring down the disproportionately high costs of regional flights or
immediately erase border restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}. And despite
signing on to the deal, Nigerian officials expressed concerns shared by
many of [[Africa's more advanced economies]{.underline}]{.mark} that
their markets [[would be flooded with **cheap
goods**]{.underline}]{.mark} from neighboring countries, [[**sinking**
their domestic manufacturers]{.underline}]{.mark}. A tweet from the
Nigerian president's office promised to "focus on taking advantage of
ongoing negotiations to secure the necessary safeguards against
smuggling, dumping and other risks/threats."

#### AfCFTA fails -- it faces problems like tariffs, corruption, job loss, and international antagonism

Talking to DW, Togo\'s Foreign Minister Robert Dussey hailed the
agreement, but did not hide the challenges posed by implementation.
[[The AfCFTA commits the]{.underline}]{.mark} majority of [[countries to
**90 percent tariff cuts**]{.underline}]{.mark} within a five-year
period, thereby reducing barriers to trade on the continent. The
deadline had to be prolonged to ten years for those listed as \"Least
Developed Countries\" by the United Nations. Another half a dozen very
recalcitrant countries, including Mozambique, Niger and Malawi, obtained
an extension of 15 years. \"[[It will need an effort to give them the
technical tools to meet the challenges ahead]{.underline}]{.mark},\"
Foreign Minister Dussey said.

A former political affairs commissioner of the AU, Aisha Laraba
Abdullahi, told DW that fears that [[eliminating tariffs could harm some
African economies]{.underline}]{.mark} are understandable. \"[[We must
not provide an opportunity for other countries to come and **dump their
products**]{.underline}]{.mark} on the continent [[and reduce our
manufacturing capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have to be on guard,\"
especially since only a very small number of African countries \"have
excelled in manufacturing,\" Abdullahi added.

Huge obstacles to free trade

But as users on DW Africa\'s Facebook page pointed out, the problem is
not just competition from the outside world. Nigerian Umeh Chidozie
wrote: \"We don\'t have electric power; our manufacturers are still
struggling to break even. Companies will go to a more stable environment
where cost of production will be cheap to manufacture and bring it in to
Nigeria\'s large market to sell without paying duty. [[We will lose **a
lot** of jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

There are more obstacles in the way of AfCFTA than just cutting tariffs,
experts say. [[Lack of infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
fundamental condition for the functioning of trade, [[is a major
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}. Aisha Abdullahi stresses that enhancing
the continent\'s infrastructure is also on the AU\'s agenda: \"Ensuring
open skies, accelerating our railways, our roads: there are projects
already happening on the continent.\" Abdullahi acknowledges that
[[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} further
[[difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[like
corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}, but sees the agenda \"on course.\"

Keeping Africa from industrializing

Some in [[the international community are **not**]{.underline}]{.mark}
as [[**optimistic** concerning the]{.underline}]{.mark} African [[free
trade zone]{.underline}]{.mark} and have not been hiding their
skepticism. Togo\'s Foreign Minister Dussey answers them saying that
\"[[African development is]{.underline}]{.mark} foremost of [[the
**responsibility** of Africans]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" He accuses [[some
rich countries]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} being
[[too keen on seeing Africa industrialize]{.underline}]{.mark}: \"You
know we have a problem with work for our youth. It is important that we
have strong industries to have work for the young,\" was his veiled
warning to an industrialized world scared about mass migration.

AfCTA has met with mixed reactions by Africans themselves. On DW
Africa\'s Facebook page, opinions are manifold, with a slight tendency
to optimism. But even this optimism is tinged with skepticism, when, for
example, Kyebakola Caesar writes: \"In form and substance, this all
looks a great deal. [[If only we]{.underline}]{.mark} \[...\] [[put
rhetoric aside]{.underline}]{.mark} and get into real business, [[then
the world will **feel us** and the **African pride** will
return]{.underline}]{.mark} to us all! African solutions to Africa\'s
problems! \"

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- Small Arms

#### The Nigerian army acted on impulse bombing civilians that were not affiliated with Boko Haram -- that made more people join the group. Ending all US assistance is key 

**[Matfess 15]{.underline}** \[Hilary Matfess \"In Partnering With
Nigeria's Abusive Military, the U.S. Is Giving Boko Haram a Lifeline.\"

https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/insights/23447/in-partnering-with-nigeria-s-abusive-military-the-u-s-is-giving-boko-haram-a-lifeline\]

Given that Maiduguri is where Boko Haram was founded, it might have been
reasonable to suspect that the group was behind the raid. Having formed
in the early 2000s as a largely nonviolent dissident sect, [[Boko Haram
launched an insurgency in 2009 that has **displaced
millions**]{.underline}]{.mark} and, according to Amnesty International,
killed more than 20,000 people. The insurgency's devastation has
triggered a broader food shortage and humanitarian crisis in the Lake
Chad basin.

As it turned out, however, [[the assault on the U.N. compound
was]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[perpetrated by members of the
**Nigerian military**]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to an internal
U.N. memo obtained by AFP, the [[Nigeria]{.underline}]{.mark}n soldiers
may [[have been acting on a]{.underline}]{.mark} far-fetched
[[rumor]{.underline}]{.mark} circulating [[on social media that Boko
Haram's leader]{.underline}]{.mark}, Abubakar Shekau, [[was being housed
there]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Those familiar with humanitarian aid operations in sub-Saharan Africa
describe the raid as unprecedented, and say it's stunning that the
military would engage in such an operation on the basis of nothing more,
apparently, than a rash of WhatsApp messages.

Even more shocking, though, is the silence of the international
community in the wake of the incident. While a spokeswoman for the U.N.
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the [[U.N. was
"extremely concerned" about what happened]{.underline}]{.mark},
Nigeria's other partners kept quiet. [[Given that the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is a
**significant military partner** of Nigeria]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the
lack of condemnation]{.underline}]{.mark} from U.S. officials of what
likely amounted to a violation [[of international humanitarian law
was]{.underline}]{.mark} especially **[[jarring]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Yet Washington's silence is consistent with a broader pattern: [[The
U.S. has]{.underline}]{.mark} routinely [[turned a **blind
eye**]{.underline}]{.mark} to abuses by the Nigerian military in the
northeast of the country [[despite the fact that the U.S. is
**supporting** Nigerian forces battling Boko Haram]{.underline}]{.mark}.
So far, there is every indication that this bilateral military
engagement will continue under President Donald Trump.

In early August, a little more than a week before the U.N. raid, [[the
U.S. approved]{.underline}]{.mark} the sale [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
some [[**\$593 million** in military hardware and
training]{.underline}]{.mark} to Nigeria. The transaction's big-ticket
item was a dozen A-29 Super Tucano light-attack aircraft.

The Nigerian government had originally sought permission to procure the
aircraft in 2015, but the military's human rights record prompted the
Obama administration to put the sale on hold. In particular, [[the
Nigerian air force has been accused of **bombing civilians** on multiple
occasions]{.underline}]{.mark}, including a January strike on a camp for
displaced people in Rann, in the northeastern state of Borno, that
killed at least 100 people, according to The Associated Press.

The Rann bombing is an extreme example of an array of abuses, including
arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial killings, committed by Nigerian
security forces in the campaign against Boko Haram. These abuses persist
even as the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has undertaken a
concerted effort to lionize Nigerian soldiers as national heroes.

Tactics used by Nigeria's military in the fight against Boko Haram make
it easier for the group to recruit.

A frequent refrain in Washington policy circles, on the rare occasions
when events in Africa manage to break through the frenetic domestic news
cycle of the Trump era, is that it is imperative to depend on "strategic
regional partners" to advance America's security objectives. But while
security partnerships, both multilateral and bilateral, are a valuable
component of America's national security toolkit, events in the Lake
Chad basin suggest that Washington's strategic partners are engaging in
counterproductive behavior.

A recent report published by the U.N. Development Program, titled
"Journey Into Extremism in Africa," draws from interviews with former
combatants in Nigeria, Mali and Somalia to show that [[many people who
join extremist groups have **suffered abuses** at the hands of the
security sector]{.underline}]{.mark}. The takeaway is clear: [[Combating
terrorist groups with tactics that make it easier for them to recruit
is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite literally
**[[self-defeating]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The behavior of the Nigerian military, therefore, demands that
Washington recalibrate its security strategy in the region, emphasizing
professionalization over weapons acquisition and improved capacity for
combat.

As Destructive as Boko Haram

The [[Nigerian military's]{.mark} abuses]{.underline} in the fight
against Boko Haram are so extensive that they are the subject of an
ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court.
[[**Extrajudicial killings** and **illegal detention** practices have
been documented at length]{.underline}]{.mark} by several
nongovernmental organizations, including Amnesty International and Human
Rights Watch.

Among the most comprehensive and distressing accounts was a 2015 report
by Amnesty International titled "Stars on Their Shoulders, Blood on
Their Hands," which tallied [more than 7,000 deaths in Nigerian
government detention centers, 1,200 additional extrajudicial killings
and the arbitrary arrest of more than 20,000 people in counterterrorism
operations]{.underline}. According to Amnesty, the military
"extrajudicially executed people after they had been captured and when
they presented no danger." The victims included people who "were shot
dead inside detention facilities, while others were either shot or had
their throats cut after being captured during cordon-and-search
operations."

In one especially gruesome incident, soldiers responding to a Boko Haram
attack in the northeastern town of Baga in April 2013 carried out a
"mop-up" operation that killed nearly 200 people. More recent accounts
from activist groups and people living in the Lake Chad basin suggest
these abusive practices have continued.

A woman I interviewed in December 2015 in the Fufore refugee camp,
located in the northeastern state of Adamawa, survived attacks by both
Boko Haram and the army. She said that of the two, the army left more
destruction in its wake. "My town was along the Boko Haram route, so
they attacked us regularly but never ruled over us," said the woman, who
is from Borno and who spoke on condition of anonymity for her safety.
"We were just trapped in our town."

But when the soldiers came, the woman said, they "burned all of our
houses and our fields." She said she had no time to collect her
possessions before the inferno began.

Another woman from the town of Walasah, also in Borno, similarly
reported that when the [[Nigerian army]{.underline}]{.mark} entered her
community, "They [[did not stop to ask who was Boko Haram; they just
**burned down the whole village**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

To the east, [[a new]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of uneasy neighbourly
[[relationship with Russia is developing]{.underline}]{.mark} -- one
that appears to involve [[Europeans accepting Russian
meddling]{.underline}]{.mark} in their political affairs, [[from]{.mark}
deliberate [interference in elections to cyber
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} on European companies, systems, and
political machinery. Further east[, China continues to
deepen]{.underline} its [influence]{.underline} on EU states through
trade and investment in the Union and its neighbourhood.

To the south, [[European countries now rely on]{.underline}]{.mark}
cooperation with [[an]{.mark} increasingly [autocratic regime in
Ankara]{.mark}]{.underline} on some of the issues that their citizens
are most concerned about, particularly migration and counter-terrorism.
Meanwhile, [[conflicts and poverty]{.mark} on the other side of the
Mediterranean]{.underline}, [[and the migration that
stems]{.underline}]{.mark} from them, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [[challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Europe's]{.underline}]{.mark} security and even its
[[solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**[[Most importantly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} west, [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} President
Donald Trump [[is demonstrating]{.mark} a [**total** disregard
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[international
agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} and norms that Europeans hold dear. By
[[withdrawing from the Paris]{.mark} climate change
[deal]{.mark}]{.underline}, by [[pulling out of the]{.mark} Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action ([JCPOA]{.mark}]{.underline}) on Iran's
nuclear programme[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [by
[attacking]{.mark}]{.underline} the integrity of [[the international
trading system through]{.underline}]{.mark} the unilateral imposition of
[[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}, Trump has called into question
Europeans' formerly unshakeable faith in diplomacy as a way to resolve
disagreements and to protect Europe. European leaders now fear that the
transatlantic security guarantee will centre not on alliances and common
interests but purchases of American technology and materiel -- and on
obeisance to an unpredictable president.

[[Europeans are]{.underline}]{.mark} -- understandably --
[[worried]{.underline}]{.mark} about this picture. But they are divided
on how to handle it. The political crisis around immigration into the EU
from 2015 onwards has revealed fundamental divisions in the way member
states view their security. As Ivan Krastev has argued, "the refugee
crisis exposed the futility of the post-Cold War paradigm, and
especially the incapacity of Cold War institutions and rules to deal
with the problems of the contemporary world." For many Europeans, the
migration crisis has called into question the ability of the EU and the
global multilateral system to protect them.

[[There are divisions]{.mark} not only between but also [within member
states]{.mark}.]{.underline} In recent years, national elections across
the EU have resulted in intense battles between [[political movements
that favour]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline}n open, [[progressive agenda
and global engagement, and those that prefer]{.mark} [a nationalist,
inward-looking approach that]{.mark} is]{.underline}, ultimately,
[[anti-EU]{.underline}.]{.mark} In this unstable political environment,
the need to keep citizens safe -- a basic responsibility of any
government -- has taken on even greater importance. [[Safety is central
to the nationalists']{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly popular
[[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}. They argue that mainstream EU
governments have failed to protect citizens. In power, however, they
face the inescapable dilemma that small European nations (and they are
all small) cannot effectively respond to today's threats through
national policies alone.

Against this backdrop of worry and division, this report aims to
understand security perceptions across the EU more fully and to search
for common responses to protect the EU's citizens. In April and May
2018, ECFR's network of 28 associate researchers completed a survey
covering all member states, having conducted interviews with
policymakers and members of the analytical community, along with
extensive research into policy documents, academic discourse, and media
analysis. Based on this pan-European survey data, ECFR's new report maps
the security profile of all member states, identifying areas of
agreement, points of contention, and issues on which they should
cooperate to keep Europe safe.

The results reveal an EU that is fairly united in its understanding of
the threats it faces, but that diverges significantly in the
vulnerability it feels to those threats. This is not just a question of
geography or size, since France and Germany, neighbours at the heart of
Europe, fall nearly on opposite ends of the spectrum. France feels
relatively resilient across the range of threats, while Germany thinks
of itself as relatively vulnerable.

There are also important variations among the member states on what role
the EU should play as a security actor. [[There is a near unanimous
consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[NATO must remain the backbone of
European security]{.underline},]{.mark} but EU member states differ
significantly on the extent to which, within the NATO framework, Europe
can or should begin to develop autonomy from the United States.

Finally, and somewhat sadly, given that there is no shortage of real
threats for Europeans to be concerned about, our research paints a
picture of an EU that is in some ways its own worst enemy. The responses
on the preoccupation with immigration highlight the extent to which it
is the political fallout of the migration crisis -- its potential to
increase support for populist parties and its use as a weapon in
European domestic politics -- and not migration itself that currently
threatens the EU.

[[Europeans are united in]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark} about the future. There is widespread
agreement throughout Europe that security threats are on the rise:
respondents to ECFR's survey judged that the threats their countries
faced intensified between 2008 and 2018, and will intensify further in
the next decade. Today[, [the top]{.underline}]{.mark} five [[perceived
threats are]{.underline}]{.mark}, in descending order: [[cyber attacks;
state collapse]{.mark} or civil war in the EU's neighbourhood; [external
meddling]{.mark}]{.underline} in domestic politics; uncontrolled
migration into the country; [[and the deterioration of the
international]{.underline}]{.mark} institutional
[[order]{.underline}]{.mark}. Respondents expected the order of these
threats to remain largely the same in the next decade (with terrorist
attacks joining the deterioration of the international order in fifth
place), and each threat to grow more intense in the period. Our
researchers assess that, with the benefit of hindsight, the situation
appeared to be slightly different in 2008, when the top perceived
threats were, in descending order: economic instability and terrorist
attacks; instability in the neighbourhood and disruption in the energy
supply; and cyber attacks -- of the kind Estonia experienced in April
2007.

### 2NC -- Europe -- Solvency -- JCPOA

#### Scientific Diplomacy offers objective solutions that can continue despite political variability, the JCPOA's construction by scientists proves

[**Berkman 18** (Paul is the Director of the Science Diplomacy Center
and Professor of Practice in Science Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, \"Could science diplomacy be the
key to stabilizing international relations?\" The Conversation,
06/12/2018,conversation.com/could-science-diplomacy-be-the-key-to-stabilizing-international-relations-87836)]{.underline}

It's no secret that [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates--[[Russia relations
are]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[rife with]{.underline}]{.mark}
tension and [[mistrust]{.underline}]{.mark}. The news is full of reports
of Russia meddling in U.S. elections, seeding U.S. media with fake news,
supporting the Syrian regime and so on.

The relationship between the two countries has reached an all-time low
since the fall of the Soviet Union, with some going so far as to call it
a new "cold war." Diplomats have been unable to mend the relationship,
as [[national security interests on each side are too narrow to provide
common ground]{.underline}]{.mark}.

But [[there are avenues]{.mark} of collaboration [beyond the security
realm]{.mark} that can help to balance strained
relationships]{.underline}, maintain open channels of communication and
build trust, enabling a more positive diplomatic process overall.

[[One]{.underline}]{.mark} key avenue [[is science]{.underline}]{.mark}.
As a common and apolitical language, science brings allies and
adversaries together with technology and innovation to address
cross-border challenges that exist across the Earth -- think climate,
disease pandemics and international trade -- which are out of reach for
a single nation to address alone.

[[Since the 1950s,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the U.S. and Russia have been
cooperating continuously]{.mark}]{.underline} in a four specific
international spaces -- the high seas, Antarctica, outer space and deep
sea -- and [[the mechanism for cooperation has consistently been
science]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, they cooperate on the 1959
Antarctic Treaty, which preserves the continent for peaceful purposes as
the first nuclear arms agreement with scientific research as the basis
for international cooperation. Similarly, in space, collaboration
between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
in 1975 led to the design of an international docking system, creating a
physical bridge for subsequent operations and joint experiments that we
see with the International Space Station today.

The term "science diplomacy" is recently coined, with the first book in
this new field emerging from the 2009 Antarctic Treaty Summit. But this
diplomatic approach has long existed in practice. As both an academic
who studies science diplomacy and a practitioner who implements it, I
suggest that [[science can]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[bridge
contemporary political differences]{.underline}]{.mark} between the
superpowers as well as other actors, [[promoting coop]{.mark}eration
[and preventing conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} across the world.

People usually think of diplomacy as how states represent themselves and
negotiate to advance their own interests. These are the fraught
high-level talks between nations that are featured on newspapers' front
pages. Diplomats on each side angle and negotiate to come out on top of
a particular issue with political expediency. Picture the sit-down in
Singapore between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

[[Science diplomacy is different]{.underline}]{.mark}, operating across
a continuum of urgencies from political to sustainability time scales.
[[Nations are still coming together to]{.mark} discuss and [resolve
cross-border issues. But what's on the table revolves around common
interests revealed]{.mark}]{.underline} across generations [[by
science]{.underline}]{.mark} -- including natural sciences and social
sciences as well as indigenous knowledge -- providing a foundation for
negotiation that is far less politically charged and divisive to discuss
and resolve the topics of the day.

For example, [[countries came together to]{.mark} share resources and
[design a joint response to two recent pandemics:
Zika]{.mark}]{.underline} in Latin America [[and
Ebola]{.underline}]{.mark} in West Africa.
[[Following]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[easing of U.S.-Cuba
relations]{.underline}]{.mark} in December 2014, scientists from [[the
two]{.mark} countries [began to collaborate on cancer
research]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Science diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[supports
econ]{.underline}]{.mark}omic [[prosperity, balancing environmental
protection and societal well-being]{.underline}]{.mark} through
innovation. Countries are sharing and collaborating on technologies that
will help transition resource-based economies to knowledge-based
economies. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of cooperation [[can yield
poverty-alleviating solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} along with progress
across a suite of sustainable development goals.

Science diplomacy is also about contributing to informed decision-making
by sharing evidence and options, without advocacy. [[This]{.mark} kind
of exchange [helps ensure the diplomatic process is
objective]{.mark}]{.underline} and inclusive, relying on our leaders to
make decisions that have legacy value. Imagine if a group of diplomats
got together in a negotiating room to assess and design a response to a
pandemic without consulting and involving medical and public health
experts. It wouldn't make sense. [[The recent Iran nuclear deal]{.mark},
for instance, [relied on scientists' expertise]{.mark} to build common
interests]{.underline} among nations as the prelude for an agreement,
[[providing an ongoing basis for cooperation despite political
variability]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Europe -- Solvency -- Cyber

#### Ukrainian infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to Russia hacking attempts and has empirically been injured

**CERULUS 19** (Laurens Cerulus covers cybersecurity, privacy and data
protection. Laurens has a passion for hacks, leaks and how technology is
changing society, "How Ukraine became a test bed for cyberweaponry,"
Politico, 02/14/2019,
https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks/)

KIEV [--- [To see the warfare of the future]{.underline}, [head
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the top floor of a nondescript office tower on a
potholed street on the scruffy outskirts of
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s capital. There, next to a darkened
conference room, [[engineers sit at dark gray monitors, waging war with
lines of code]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"[[Attacks are happening every day]{.mark},]{.underline}" says Oleh
Derevianko, founder of the Ukrainian cybersecurity firm that employs
them, Information Systems Security Partners. \"We never thought we were
going to be the front line of cyber and hybrid war.\"

There may be no better place to witness cyber conflict in action than
Ukraine today. [[Open warfare with Russia, a high]{.underline}]{.mark}ly
[[skilled, computer-literate pool of talent and a uniquely vulnerable
political, economic and IT environment]{.underline}]{.mark} have made
the country the perfect sandbox for those looking to test new
cyberweapons, tactics and tools.

\"[[Ukraine is live-fire space]{.underline}]{.mark},\" says Kenneth
Geers, a veteran cybersecurity expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council who advises NATO\'s Tallinn cyber center and spent time on the
ground in Ukraine to study the country's cyber conflict. Much like
global powers fought proxy wars in the Middle East or Africa during the
Cold War, [[Ukraine has become a battleground in a cyberwar arms
race]{.mark} for global influence]{.underline}.

Derevianko\'s outfit works closely with the Ukrainian government and its
U.S. and European allies to fend off onslaughts against the country's
networks. On the other side of the virtual front line: Not just
sophisticated Russian-affiliated hacker groups like Fancy Bear, Cozy
Bear and Sandworm --- the group behind "NotPetya," the most devastating
cyberattack to date --- but also hosts of other governmental,
nongovernmental and criminal players testing out their capabilities on
the country's networks.

[[Activity has spiked]{.underline}]{.mark} ahead of presidential
elections in March, says Derevianko. Since November, [[hacker groups
have been shelling Ukrainian]{.underline}]{.mark} magistrates,
[[government officials]{.underline}]{.mark}, attorneys [[and others
with]{.mark}]{.underline} emails that contain attachments with [[malware
and viruses]{.underline}]{.mark} --- sometimes disguised as Christmas
greetings, or as messages from the prime minister's office --- in what
Derevianko describes as "[[mass phishing]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Russian hacker groups are repeatedly attempting to get into the
country's systems, Ukraine's national security service told POLITICO.
[[Critical infrastructure and election systems are under constant
stress]{.underline}]{.mark}, it said.

"They're not only testing destruction but also testing your reflexes,"
says Derevianko.

The war in eastern Ukraine has given Russian-affiliated hackers the
opportunity to perfect their ability to launch cyberattacks with a
series of major intrusions in Ukraine over the past few years.

"The annexation of Crimea and war in Donbas, it has created a volatile
political environment,\" says Merle Maigre, the former head of NATO's
cyberdefense center in Tallinn who is now executive vice president at
the Estonian cybersecurity firm CybExer.

Even as Russian tanks crossed the physical border into eastern Ukraine
in the spring of 2014, Russian-affiliated hackers were sending malicious
code onto Ukraine's IT systems, providing political chaos as a
smokescreen.

Three days before the presidential election [[in May 2014, hackers broke
into Ukraine's Central Election Commission and disabled parts of the
network using]{.underline}]{.mark} advanced cyberespionage
[[malware]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to a report by the
International Foundation of Electoral Systems funded by the U.S. and
U.K. and seen by POLITICO. The Central Election Commission was hit again
later that year, when [[hackers took down its website ahead of a]{.mark}
parliamentary [vote in October]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Large-scale attacks followed the next year, and again [[in 2016. The
targets]{.underline}]{.mark}, this time, [[were companies running
Ukraine's power]{.underline} [grid]{.underline}. [In 2015, hackers
used]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called BlackEnergy malware, dropped on
companies' networks using spear [[phishing attacks that tricked
employees into downloading from mock emails]{.underline}]{.mark}.
So-called KillDisk malware later destroyed parts of the grid.

[[The resulting blackouts]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the world's first
known successful cyberattack on an energy company at scale ---
[[affected about 230,000 Ukrainians]{.underline}]{.mark} for up to six
hours. [A year later, [in December 2016, hackers]{.mark}]{.underline}
relied on even more sophisticated tools to successfully [[turn off the
lights in large parts of the Ukrainian capital yet
again]{.underline}.]{.mark}

But the widest-reaching attack --- and the world's most financially
damaging to date --- took place in 2017, when hackers combined code
tested in the power grid attacks with malware known as "Petya" and a
security vulnerability initially discovered by the U.S. National
Security Agency called EternalBlue.

The resulting malware --- \"[[NotPetya]{.underline}]{.mark}" ---
[[compromised]{.underline}]{.mark} the software of a small tech firm
called Linkos Group, providing it [[access to the computers of utility
companies, banks, airports and government agencies in
Ukraine]{.underline}.]{.mark} It also crippled multinationals like the
Danish shipping giant Maersk, logistics giant FedEx, pharma company
Merck and other major corporations.

#### Cybersecurity talks could set a global precedent for cybersecurity norms and already aid in securing the cyber domain

**[CFR 18]{.underline}** (Council on Foreign Relations, (CFR) is an
independent, nonpartisan membership organization, think tank, and
publisher, \"Increasing International Cooperation in Cybersecurity and
Adapting Cyber Norms,\" 02/23/2018,
https://www.cfr.org/report/increasing-international-cooperation-cybersecurity-and-adapting-cyber-norms)

[[Government]{.mark}s]{.underline}, global [[industry, and experts from
academia and civil society should work together to]{.underline}]{.mark}
prevent cyberwar, [[restrict offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} by nonstate actors, [[and
mitigate]{.mark} the]{.underline} daily economic [[threats that ICTs
pose]{.mark} to the global economy]{.underline}. The following
recommendations seek to maximize international cooperation while
minimizing politicization and cyber risk.

[[Restart the U.S.-Russia dialogue on cyber issues. The
relationship]{.mark} between the United States and Russia [is of crucial
importance]{.mark}]{.underline} for the whole ecosystem of cyber policy
and diplomacy. [[The two]{.underline}]{.mark} countries [[are among the
most advanced cyber powers and were the first to
develop]{.underline}]{.mark} ICT confidence-building measures ([[a
"cyber nonaggression pact]{.mark}"]{.underline}), and they remain the
front-runners on global cyber-policy discussions.

[[Disagreement]{.underline}s]{.mark} and accusations between the United
States and Russia [[have been escalating]{.underline}]{.mark} for three
years [[and]{.underline} [are]{.underline}]{.mark} partly [[responsible
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[lack of progress]{.underline}]{.mark} on
the establishment of cyber rules for responsible state behavior[. [The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates is aligned
with a group of countries that [[insists]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[existing international law fully applies to cyberspace, whereas
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is aligned with another group that [[wants a
new treaty tailored]{.mark} specifically [to this
domain]{.mark}]{.underline}. As long as they run in different
directions, no major progress on cyber norms can be achieved.

U.S.-Russia cyber negotiations could still be successful.

Critics may argue that new agreements between Washington and Moscow are
impossible, given the accusations that Russia used ICTs to meddle in the
2016 U.S. presidential election and that the United States used ICTs for
its own geopolitical and surveillance goals, as exposed by Edward
Snowden. However, U.S.-Russia cyber negotiations could still be
successful. [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[found itself in a similar position in
2015, when the]{.underline}]{.mark} Barack [[Obama
admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[was close to]{.underline}]{.mark}
imposing broad [[sanctions against China in retribution for
hackers]{.underline}]{.mark} (allegedly supported by the Chinese
government) stealing industrial secrets, costing the U.S. economy
billions of dollars in damages. [[Rather than
cut]{.underline}]{.mark}ting [[off dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark} on
cyber issues, however, [[Obama and]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese
President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [[were able to sign
a]{.mark} substantial [cyber economic-espionage
agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} that sharply curtailed China-based
cyberattacks on the United States. The U.S.-China agreement was
realistic and limited in scope, something the United States and Russia
should also strive to achieve. For example, the two powers could aim for
an agreement limited to the prevention of dangerous military activities
in cyberspace, similar to the U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea Agreement of
1972.

[[Reconvene UN experts and implement existing
norms]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2004, [the]{.underline} UN Group of
Government Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and
Telecommunications in the Context of International Security ([[UN GGE)
was established to develop a]{.mark} common [approach to how governments
should behave]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in cyberspace.
[[Its]{.underline}]{.mark} 2015 [[report provided the]{.mark}
[foundation for a]{.mark}]{.underline}n internationally recognized
governmental [[cyber code of conduct]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The 2015 report recommended eleven basic but important norms, including
determinations that states should not knowingly allow their territory to
be used for internationally wrongful cyber acts; should not conduct or
knowingly support ICT activities that intentionally damage critical
infrastructure; and should seek to prevent the proliferation of
malicious technologies and the use of harmful hidden functions. In this
consensus document, existing and emerging threats in cyberspace were
spelled out; basic norms, rules, and principles for responsible behavior
were proposed; and confidence-building measures, international
cooperation, and capacity-building were given the attention they
deserve.

[Unfortunately, [the UN GGE failed to reach a consensus
in]{.mark}]{.underline} June [[2017]{.underline}]{.mark} on a successor
to the 2015 report. [[However, the group is not
defunct]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it should reconvene as soon as
possible. Instead of attempting to expand on the 2015 report, it should
be given stronger official status, for instance as a UN General Assembly
resolution. [[If it was coauthored by all the]{.underline}]{.mark}
permanent [[members of the UN Security Council, it would likely get
broad support]{.mark} from other countries]{.underline}. Although a UN
resolution would be nonbinding, it would serve as a step toward
institutionalizing cyber norms.

#### Conflict with China over cybersecurity threatens to create a technological rift that creates conflict no matter what level of integration with China exists

**[CFR 19]{.underline}** (Council on Foreign Relations, (CFR) is an
independent, nonpartisan membership organization, think tank, and

and China?\" 06/26/2019,

[[The U.S. D]{.underline}]{.mark}epartment [[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f
[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ommerce's [[placement of Huawei on the Entity
List]{.underline},]{.mark} effectively banning U.S. suppliers from
trading essential components like chips and software with the company,
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} seriously [[escalated the
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} with
Beijing. [[European countries]{.mark},]{.underline} more [reliant on
Huawei and trade with China]{.underline} than the United States, [[risk
getting caught]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two superpowers. The
European Union (EU) has named China as a "systemic rival," in part
because of mounting concerns about discriminatory industrial policies
but [[many]{.mark} European [countries are reluctant to follow U.S.
warnings]{.mark} to]{.underline} completely [cut ties with Huawei and
suffer]{.underline} the technological and economic
[consequences]{.underline} of a decoupling from China.

With a lot more to lose through confrontation, [[Europe has
to]{.mark}]{.underline} carefully [[consider]{.mark} when and [how to
press on privacy, fair competition, ownership of core
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}, and other issues with
China[.]{.underline} Beijing should make sure that its pursuit of
"internet sovereignty" and technology leadership do not harm European
security and business interests.

To understand the forces driving the relationship, SWP and the European
University Viadrina invited 30 experts from Europe and China to
participate in a scenario analysis workshop under the guidance of the
Deloitte Center for the Long View on the future of China-EU digital
geopolitics over the next 15 years. The group differentiated the
scenarios around two axes: the degree of transnational interoperability
between social and technical systems (fragmentation vs. integration of
global networks) and sustainability of digital ecosystems (vulnerability
vs. resilience). The result of the workshop was the following four
fictional, but plausible scenarios.

Scenario 1: Cyber Peace (integration, resilience)

In the least confrontational future scenario "Cyber Peace," a series of
criminal cyberattacks on household systems, public transport, and the
operating software of medical devices pressured European governments and
the PRC to find common solutions to digital threats. The EU and China
developed new joint institutions such as a Sino-European Council on
Cybersecurity and issued the "Shenzhen Agreement" with promised joint
financing for the cooperative development of cybersecurity technologies.
The rate of technological innovation and levels of trust are high in
both economies, and Beijing and Brussels remain in productive
competition over standards and regulatory practices.

Scenario 2: Collapse of Digital Commons (integration, vulnerability)

The "[[Collapse of Digital Commons]{.underline}" [scenario]{.underline}
[assumes]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [high]{.mark} degree of
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nical [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[econ]{.underline}]{.mark}omic [[integration]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
with vulnerable digital and social systems.
[[Cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline} launched by states, terrorists, and
criminals [[are daily occurrences]{.mark}. China and Europe still
benefit]{.underline} from highly integrated markets and production
chains, [but [the tense security situation causes political and social
upheavals]{.mark}]{.underline}. European politicians prioritize security
over social justice, rule of law, privacy, individual rights, and
democracy. [[Instability leads to]{.mark} political
[radicalization]{.mark} in Europe,]{.underline} coupled with open
hostility toward China.

Scenario 3: Vulnerable Digital Islands (fragmentation, vulnerability)

In this scenario, [[there is high vulnerability to cyberattacks
even]{.underline}]{.mark} though global trade has shrunk [[as
protectionism advances]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mistrust is omnipresent and
international arms control efforts are diminished. European data and
security guidelines were passed, but they were not further implemented
by companies or countries outside of Europe. European tech companies
cannot keep up with those operating in larger protected markets abroad.
The "Block of Independent States" (BIS), [[the

Scenario 4: Digital Trench Warfare (fragmentation, resilience)

The scenario experts deemed [[most plausible was "Digital Trench
Warfare."]{.underline}]{.mark} Here, global socio-technical
fragmentation meets high levels of social and technological resilience.
In this world, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[China, and Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}
hide behind impenetrable digital barriers, along with escalating
differences in rules and standards for privacy, access, and content.
They [[compete globally for]{.underline}]{.mark} natural [[resources
like rare earths and wage proxy wars]{.underline}]{.mark} in third
countries. In this world, [the internet has been replaced by
[incompatible state cyberspaces]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the
differences in the systems are accelerated by digital research
strategies striving for autarky. Supply chains have been largely
re-shored and foreign technology outlawed. States are dominant in this
economy because every aspect of technology is tightly regulated. A sharp
decline in commercial, cultural, and scientific exchanges is the result.
[It [is a poorer but more secure world]{.mark}]{.underline} inside the
respective blocks.

The gloomy world painted by three of these four scenarios is troubling,
and current diplomatic efforts such as a bilateral cyber dialogue and
business to business relations are failing in the task of achieving
sustainable cooperation between China and Europe. This scenario-based
effort suggests that [[Europe should upgrade]{.mark} the [bilateral
cyber dialogue with China]{.mark}]{.underline}, which currently only
exists at the Council level, to involve heads of state and heads of
government as well as increase the staffing, financing, and technical
support of the delegations.

[[Russia remains a]{.underline}]{.mark}n acute and [[formidable ‌threat
to]{.mark} the U.S. and]{.underline} its interests in [[Europe]{.mark}.
From the Arctic to the Baltics, Ukraine, the South Caucasus, and
increasingly the Mediterranean Sea, [Russia continues to foment
instability]{.mark} in Europe. [**Despite** economic problems, Russia
continues to prioritize]{.mark}]{.underline} the rebuilding of its
military and funding for its [military [operations
abroad]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Russia's military and political
antagonism toward the United States continues unabated, and its [efforts
to undermine]{.underline} U.S. institutions and [the NATO alliance are
serious and troubling. [Russia uses its energy
position]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe along with [[espionage,
cyberattacks, and information warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} to exploit
vulnerabilities and seeks [[to]{.mark} drive wedges into the
transatlantic alliance and [undermine]{.mark}]{.underline} people's
faith [in [government and]{.mark} societal
[institutions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Overall, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has significant conventional and
nuclear capabilities and [[remains the top threat]{.mark} to European
security]{.underline}. Its aggressive stance in a number of theaters,
including the Balkans, Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine, continues both to
encourage destabilization and to threaten U.S. interests.

Russian Military Capabilities. According to the International Institute
for Strategic Studies (IISS), among the key weapons in Russia's
inventory are 313 intercontinental ballistic missiles; 2,780 main battle
tanks; and more than 5,140 armored infantry fighting vehicles, more than
6,100 armored personnel carriers, and more than 4,328 pieces of
artillery. The navy has one aircraft carrier; 62 submarines (including
13 ballistic missile submarines); five cruisers; 15 destroyers; 13
frigates; and 100 patrol and coastal combatants. The air force has 1,176
combat-capable aircraft. The IISS counts 280,000 members of the army.
Russia also has a total reserve force of 2,000,000 for all armed
forces.1 Russian deep-sea research vessels include converted ballistic
missile submarines, which hold smaller auxiliary submarines that can
operate on the ocean floor.2

To avoid political blowback from military deaths abroad, [[Russia
has]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[deployed]{.mark}]{.underline}
paid [[private volunteer troops]{.underline}]{.mark} trained at Special
Forces bases and often under the command of Russian Special Forces.
Russia has used such volunteers in Libya, Syria, and Ukraine because
[["\[t\]hey]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[provide]{.underline}]{.mark}
the Kremlin with plausible political [[deniability but
also]{.underline}]{.mark} apparently [t[ake
casualties]{.mark}]{.underline} the Russian [[authorities do not
report]{.underline}]{.mark}."3 In December 2017, it was reported that
3,000 mercenaries from one private company, the Wagner Group, which is
closely tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin, have fought in Syria
since 2015.4

#### Russia has continuously sought to exploit geo-political issues to destroy EU credibility and to push a nationalist run world

**[Miller 16]{.underline}** (Christopher, Christopher is Mashable\'s

space and especially Ukraine, where he lived and worked for more than
five years, \"How disunity and instability in Europe benefits Vladimir
Putin,\" Mashable,
\"https://mashable.com/2016/02/26/russia-europe-brexit/)

[[Russia is using a variety of]{.underline}]{.mark} different [[methods
to undermine the EU]{.underline}]{.mark} and push it to the brink of
collapse, experts say.

For years, [Moscow [has bankrolled radical
far-right]{.mark}]{.underline} political parties [[and fringe groups to
exploit]{.underline}]{.mark} popular [[dissent]{.underline}]{.mark}
against the EU.

SEE ALSO: Why Russian nationalists are celebrating the far-right\'s win
in France

In 2014, at the same time Russian forces were seizing control Ukraine\'s
Crimean peninsula, Political Capital, a Budapest-based research
institute that has tracked the extent of Moscow\'s reach in Western
Europe, published a report showing just how many such groups it was
funding.

Since then, [Moscow has [given]{.mark}]{.underline} large sums of [[cash
to]{.underline}]{.mark} Marine [[Le Pen\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} French
[[far-right]{.underline}]{.mark} National Front [[party]{.mark}, among
many others]{.underline}.

More recently, [Moscow [has been accused of
\"weaponizing\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Syrian
[[refugees]{.underline}]{.mark} and [using them [as a geopolitical
tool]{.mark}]{.underline} to undermine the EU.

Aslund alleged that Russian forces are [[deliberately bombing civilian
areas]{.underline}]{.mark} in the war-torn country [[to
\"increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the stream of
[[refugees]{.underline}]{.mark} to Europe, which brings the EU out of
balance.\"

Aiding Putin, of course, is [his powerful propaganda
machine]{.underline} that is state-run media. Kremlin-funded outlets
[have been working in overdrive]{.underline} in recent months, according
to StopFake, a Ukrainian fact checking site that exposes biased and fake
Russian news reports. StopFake said that [[from Feb. 1-8,
Sputnik]{.underline}]{.mark}, Russia\'s English-language news site for
Western audiences, [[published 14 stories on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Brexit]{.underline}]{.mark} issue, including eight with overtly
negative headlines.

They also propagate those stories on social media. For example:

Over the same period this month, the Kremlin-sponsored [[RT]{.mark}.com
[also published biased coverage]{.mark} while giving air-time only to
commentators]{.underline} who were heavily in [favor of a
Brexit]{.underline}, StopFake found.

Both outlets, which promise readers an \"alternative opinion\" to
mainstream Western media, continue to publish similar reports and op-eds
almost daily.

Putin\'s recent actions in Ukraine and Syria, and his current efforts in
exploiting the refugee crises for Russia\'s gain, Aslund said, show
[Putin has orchestrated a]{.underline}n organized [destabilization
campaign against the EU]{.underline}, and he is willing to see it
through.

\"The worse it is \[in Europe\], the better it is for Putin,\" Aslund
said.

#### Russian interference in European domestic politics is ongoing

[[Two]{.underline}]{.mark} recent [[images from]{.mark} the
[2017]{.mark} French election [capture the]{.mark}]{.underline} current
[[EU-Russia relationship. The first]{.underline}]{.mark}, from 24 March,
[[shows]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin
receiving]{.underline}]{.mark} French presidential candidate Marine [[Le
Pen]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Kremlin. [[With a
smile]{.underline}]{.mark}, Putin approvingly declared that the
far-right Le Pen represented a range of political forces gaining
momentum across Europe. This meeting epitomised Europe's darkest fears:
the European project drowning in a nationalist-populist tsunami cheered
on by the Kremlin.

[[The second]{.underline}]{.mark} image, however,
[[shows]{.underline}]{.mark} Europe's resilience despite these fears.
Just two months later, [[Putin stood uncomfortably]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the Palace of Versailles [[next to]{.underline}]{.mark} Emmanuel
[[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark}, the new pro-European French president who
had just defeated Le Pen. [Macron stated bluntly that [Russian
propaganda]{.mark}]{.underline} channels [[had spread false
information]{.underline}]{.mark} during the election, but he did so in a
matter-of-fact manner, without succumbing to the hysteria that so often
characterises Western discussions on Russia in general and its meddling
in particular. [The French]{.underline} government had elegantly
[ignored a hacking attack]{.underline} on the eve of the election [and
[Macron prevailed anyway]{.mark}]{.underline}. Looking at
[Putin's]{.underline} impenetrable expression, one could almost hear his
unspoken [message]{.underline}: "Chapeau! [You have won this round. But
there will be more]{.underline}."

These two meetings show both the highs and the lows of Europe's current
struggle with Russia. [Since]{.underline} Russia's annexation of Crimea
and invasion of eastern [Ukraine in 2014,]{.underline} [[the EU and
Russia have become locked in]{.mark} a]{.underline}n open [[battle
over]{.mark} the norms of [international conduct. They disagree
on]{.mark}]{.underline} some of the most fundamental normative elements
of the post-cold war international order -- its [[Western-led "unipolar"
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}; its [emphasis on [human rights and
democracy; and the idea]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[countries]{.mark}
[have the right to choose]{.mark}]{.underline} their own
[[alliances]{.mark} and join]{.underline} once they qualify. It is
normative war, and neither side is ready to retreat.

[Domestic politics]{.underline} in Europe [has become one of the front
lines]{.underline} in this struggle. [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} makes
use of forces inside Europe that might erode the EU's confidence and
position. But these [[efforts, while state-approved]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the broadest sense, [[do not necessarily amount
to]{.mark}]{.underline} well-coordinated and [meticulously
[planned]{.mark} [op]{.mark}]{.underline}eration[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}
with concrete political aims. Insiders confess that such operations
often come from [disparate agents of Moscow doing their
routine]{.underline} work, and [soldiers of fortune]{.underline} trying
their luck in an improvised, ad hoc manner. Europeans need to be aware
of such attempts, but [[obsessive]{.mark} attention to Russian [efforts
might prove counterproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}: it could lead to
fighting raindrops instead of fixing the roof.

The French experience shows the path. Thanks to Russia's earlier
interference in Germany and the United States, the French government
knew what to expect. It kept an eye on Russia and its agents. At least
once, the Quai d'Orsay contacted the Russian ambassador to remind him of
the rules of the game.\[1\] But [[Macron]{.mark} wisely avoided making
Russian interference]{.underline} a [central]{.underline} topic in the
campaign. Instead, [he [focused on France's
problems]{.mark}]{.underline} and how to reinvigorate Europe.
[[This]{.mark} combination -- keep an eye on Russia but [focus on
home]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[proved]{.underline}]{.mark} [[an
effective way to]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[win]{.mark} French
[voters]{.mark} and handle]{.underline} Russian [meddling]{.underline}.

04/19/2017,
<https://www.americansecurityproject.org/us-russia-cooperation-in-science/>)

[[The US and Russia should]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[pursue
joint-research]{.underline}]{.mark} projects across a number of
scientific disciplines to reduce the economic costs of research, benefit
from one another's scientific expertise, [and increase diplomatic
engagement on uncontroversial issues]{.underline}. Projects should be
[[limited to civilian technologies and objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}
that can improve the lives of American and Russian citizens while
[having]{.underline} limited to [no utility for either country's
military]{.underline}. By [working together]{.underline}, the US and
Russia [can forego the need to]{.underline} build expensive, specialized
research complexes or [develop scientific expertise that might already
exist]{.underline} in the other country. US-Russo science diplomacy has
a long history dating back to the early years of the Cold War and can
play an important role in enhancing the quality and quantity of avenues
of communication in Track-Two Talks.

Maintain US Funding to the ITER Fusion Project

The [[ITER]{.underline}]{.mark} project [[is an international
effort]{.underline}]{.mark} between 35 nations, including the US and
Russia, [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} develop [and [build a fusion
reactor]{.underline}]{.mark} capable of producing more electricity than
it receives, a mission that has so far eluded the scientific community.
[[The US and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} previously
[[commit]{.underline}ted]{.mark} to provide [[9.1% of the
funding]{.underline}]{.mark} for the project with the other
participating nations providing the remainder of the funds. The US
should maintain its commitment to the project and work to ensure that
other member nations do the same.

Why?

Fusion is energy released by forcing atomic nuclei together -- the same
process that powers the sun. If successful, this project would be a
major breakthrough in the development of fusion energy. This is
significant because fusion energy is sustainable, safe, and clean. If
harnessed, fusion has the potential to provide an effectively limitless
source of energy without environmental drawbacks. This project is one of
the premier examples of international scientific cooperation and
[[cutting back or abandoning US]{.underline}
[support]{.underline}]{.mark} for the project [[could encourage other
countries to do the same]{.underline}]{.mark}; given prevailing
political sentiments across Europe, the EU likely would not be able to
replace the US' share of funding and ITER could be suspended or ended
altogether. If this occurred, the US would lose access to a valuable
research project that it paid relatively little for while also losing
access to the scientific expertise the project has already attracted.
Even if the project ultimately fails, the US still benefits from the
connections and relationships that develop between American scientists
and their international counterparts. Additionally, the knowledge gained
from a hypothetical failed ITER could be applied by the American
scientific community to future fusion projects.

This plan has some risk

While the US only pays 9.1% of ITER's budget, those payments have still
amounted to a cumulative total of \$3.9 billion from 2003-2014 and is
expected to cost at least \$230 in 2018. At the same time, the project's
timeline has been extended and estimates for when initial experiments
begin range from 2020 to 2025. Despite this, the Department of Energy
has recommended continuing funding due to the effectiveness of reforms
in the ITER project instituted by its new Director-General, Bernard
Bigot. [Concerns]{.underline} over the project [should not deter the
US]{.underline} from maintaining current levels of funding; the US does
not need to commit funds on a long-term basis, so [if further
problems]{.underline} with the ITER project [emerge]{.underline} in 2017
or 2018, [the US has the option to pull out]{.underline} of the project
then. Research and development in any field are inherently expensive,
and fusion research is more expensive than most. ITER is still the most
promising fusion project currently in existence, and the US currently
pays a relatively small share of the project's costs while having full
access to any breakthroughs it produces.

Continue US-Russian Cooperation with the International Space Station

The US and Russia should continue their cooperation in space, especially
with regards to the International Space Station (ISS), through crew
exchanges, cost-sharing, and joint space research projects.

Why?

The ISS remains the most well-known example of international scientific
collaboration and has taken on symbolic importance. US withdrawal from
the project, or efforts to force a Russian withdrawal, would be
significantly damaging to the US-Russia relationship. Continued
cooperation is important to minimizing the costs of getting into orbit,
maintaining and supplying the station, and conducting research. The
facilities necessary for launches, production of specialized equipment,
astronaut training, etc. are all expensive, and, while NASA developed
strong domestic capabilities throughout the Cold War, the ISS has
facilitated the use of equipment and facility sharing to bring down the
total cost of space missions.

While the entry of American space companies such as SpaceX and
BlueOrigin to the space market removes US dependence on the
Russian-supplied Soyuz launch capsule, an open, competitive procurement
process for components related to the ISS mission is more in line with
American interests. By remaining open to the use of Russian components,
the US will benefit from the increased rate of innovation and
cost-saving that comes from market competition between commercial
suppliers and Russia. Also, maintaining open competition for ISS
missions raises the likelihood that other participating countries,
Russia included, will use commercial components, benefiting the US
economy.

On top of these benefits, [[crew exchanges and public diplomacy]{.mark}
efforts [involving astronauts and cosmonauts can mitigate]{.mark} the
[decline in US-Russian relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Crew exchanges
provide important contacts and relationships between the US and Russian
space administrations. [Astronauts and cosmonauts can hold joint press
conferences and host events that can diminish hostile public
sentiment]{.underline} that limit the options available to foreign
policy decision makers. Cooperation aboard the ISS remains one of the
few bright spots in US-Russia relations and it should be protected.

This plan is low risk

The US and Russia both benefit immensely from the ISS and the project
itself has taken on symbolic importance in both countries. The US has
already developed policies and protections to mitigate the risk of
unwanted technology transfers to Russia that can be updated if deemed
necessary. Research aboard the ISS is exclusively civilian in nature,
and the US-Russian cooperation on the project has a strong, positive
record.

Continued Joint Research Initiatives

[[The US and Russia should continue to promote]{.mark} joint
[research]{.mark} initiatives]{.underline} between the two countries
because [they drive down the cost of research, establish links between
the two societies, and advance the rate of research and standards of
living]{.underline} in both countries. Past examples include a joint
effort to identify and combat "black carbon" in the Arctic, basic
research in chemistry, and the development and use of the Borexino
detector (pg 65).

Why?

The pursuit of civilian research between the US and Russia has a
longstanding history that dates back to the Cold War and has long been a
durable source of cooperation between the two countries. By taking
advantage of one another's specialized facilities and personnel,
otherwise impossible research breakthroughs are able to occur much
earlier than they otherwise would have. Additionally, [[tying up
scientific personnel in]{.underline}]{.mark} research [[projects with
peaceful purposes reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} the available stock of
[[scientists that could be put onto military
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}

While [[Ukrainians are surely right to distrust
Russia]{.underline}'s]{.mark} intentions in the east, Moscow's actions
so far do not suggest a plan of escalation. The passport move does
signal Moscow's resolve to bolster ties with Russian speakers in
Ukraine. But Zelenskyy's election was likely not its impetus. "We're not
orienting our policy around Zelenskyy", a Russian official said.
[[Overestimating Moscow's appetite for escalation could have its own
negative consequences. If Kyiv interprets Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
move to expedite passports [[as escalatory and pushes back, even if only
rhetorically, it risks feeding a spiral of both words and
action]{.underline}]{.mark}, rendering the escalation prophecy
self-fulfilling.

[[Instead, the new admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[in
Kyiv]{.underline}]{.mark} and its European supporters [[could take
advantage of Moscow's waiting game, and]{.underline}]{.mark} use the
time to construct a better policy for engaging the people of the east.

Moscow in order to move toward **real** peace]{.mark}, including how it
wants to move forward on Minsk.]{.underline} [[Zelenskyy's

**[Polyakova 19]{.underline}** (Alina Polyakova is the founding director

Pay attention to Ukraine's elections," Brookings Institution,
03/28/2019)

No one knows who will come out on top among the 39 candidates running
for president in this Sunday's election in Ukraine, but one thing is
nearly certain: The winner won't be a pro-Russian candidate. As Ukraine
marks five years since its democratic revolution, [[Russia's war against
Ukraine has solidified the country's path toward Euro-Atlantic
integration]{.mark}. Despite differences on domestic policies, the top
contenders all support Ukraine's eventual membership in NATO and the
EU]{.underline}.

With Russia's continued occupation of Crimea and war in the Donbas,
Ukraine also remains a key arena of contestation between Russia and the
West. Ukraine is a large European country with a population of 45
million people. It is rich in natural resources and human capital, and
its success or failure in achieving long-lasting democratic and economic
reforms can tip the balance in great power contestation. [[The Kremlin
seeks to prevent Ukraine from moving toward the West by keeping it in a
permanent "grey zone]{.mark}." [To achieve that]{.mark} goal[, Russia
continues to destabilize Ukraine]{.mark} through conventional and
nonconventional military means while seeking to undermine Ukraine's
democratic and economic reform process. [Deterring an increasingly
aggressive Russia must start in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Continued Russian military operations in the Donbas have cost over
13,000 Ukrainian lives and displaced over 1.5 million Ukrainians since
2014. Moscow opened a new front against Ukraine in November 2018. In
that attack, the Russian coast guard fired on and seized three Ukrainian
naval vessels and detained 24 Ukrainian crew members as they transited
the Kerch Strait. This followed a months-long Russian effort to control
the Sea of Azov through regular harassment and detention of Ukrainian
commercial ships, as well as foreign vessels seeking passage to
Ukrainian ports.

[[Russia ha]{.mark}s]{.underline} also [[used Ukraine as a test-lab
for]{.underline}]{.mark} its arsenal of political warfare. This includes
[[information warfare, cyberattacks, the use of energy supplies for
political ends, and the export of corruption]{.underline}]{.mark} to
gain a foothold in politics. While Russian interference in Western
elections came as a surprise to many, Russia has a long track record of
intervening in Ukraine's elections since 2004. Ukraine's experience is
thus a bellwether for assessing the Russian tactics that may be deployed
against the West.

### 2NC -- Europe -- AT: Paris DA

#### Paris Climate Accord doesn't force requirements and allows involved countries to set their own goals, and also has no form of punishment beyond peer pressure

**[Denchak 18]{.underline}** (Melissa Denchak Melissa Denchak is an
author and freelance editor based in Brooklyn, New York who writes for
various publications and organizations, \"Paris Climate Agreement,\"
National Resource Defense Council, 12/12/2018,
https://www.nrdc.org/stories/paris-climate-agreement-everything-you-need-know)

[[In an effort to]{.underline}]{.mark} "significantly [[reduce
the]{.underline}]{.mark} risks and [[impacts of climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}," [[the accord calls for limiting the
globa]{.mark}l]{.underline} average [[temp]{.underline}]{.mark}erature
rise in this century [to [well below 2 degrees
Celsius]{.mark}]{.underline}, while pursuing efforts to limit the
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. It also asks countries to work to
achieve a leveling-off of global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as
possible and to become carbon neutral no later than the second half of
this century. To achieve these objectives, [[186
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}---responsible for more than 90 percent of
global emissions---[[**submitted** carbon reduction
**targets**]{.underline}]{.mark}, known as "intended nationally
determined contributions" (INDCs), prior to the Paris conference.
[[These]{.mark} targets [outlined each country's
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline} for curbing emissions (including
through the preservation of carbon sinks) through 2025 or 2030,
including both economy-wide carbon-cutting goals and the individual
commitments of some 2,250 cities and 2,025 companies.

INDCs turn into NDCs---nationally determined contributions---once a
country formally joins the agreement. [[There are **no** specific
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark} about how or how much countries should
cut emissions, but there have been political expectations about the type
and stringency of targets by various countries. As a result, [[national
plans vary greatly]{.underline}]{.mark} in scope and ambition, largely
reflecting each country's capabilities, its level of development, and
its contribution to emissions over time. China, for example, committed
to leveling off its carbon emissions no later than 2030 and reducing
carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 60 to 65
percent from 2005 levels by 2030. India set its sights on cutting
emissions intensity by 33 to 35 percent below 2005 levels and generating
40 percent of its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates---the
world's largest historical emitter and the second-biggest current carbon
emitter after China---committed to cutting overall greenhouse gas
emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. U.S.
[[initiatives to achieve the target include the Clean Power Plan (a
state-by-state program to cut carbon pollution]{.underline}]{.mark} from
the power sector) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [tightening of
automotive fuel economy standards]{.underline}]{.mark} to reduce
transportation emissions---[[both policies the Trump
admin]{.mark}istration [is working]{.mark} hard [to roll
back]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Paris [[Agreement
includes]{.underline}]{.mark} a series of
[[mandatory]{.underline}]{.mark} measures for the [[monitoring,
verification, and public reporting]{.underline}]{.mark} of progress
toward a country's emissions-reduction targets. The enhanced
transparency rules apply common frameworks for all countries, with
accommodations and support provided for nations that currently lack the
capacity to enable them to strengthen their systems over time.

Among other requirements, [[countries must report their greenhouse gas
inventories]{.underline}]{.mark} and progress relative to their targets,
allowing outside experts to evaluate their success. Countries are also
expected to revisit their pledges by 2020 and put forward new targets
every five years, with the goal of further driving down emissions. They
must participate in a "global stocktake" to measure collective efforts
toward meeting the Paris Agreement's long-term goals as well.
Meanwhile[, [developed countries]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [have to
estimate]{.mark} how much [financial assistance]{.mark} they'll allocate
[to developing nations]{.mark}]{.underline} to help them reduce
emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

These transparency and accountability provisions are similar to those in
the frameworks of other international agreements. While [[the system

#### Clean energy offers a far stronger economy and already provides more jobs than fossil fuels, contradictory articles are based off a flawed study

**[Denchak 18]{.underline}** (Melissa Denchak Melissa Denchak is an
author and freelance editor based in Brooklyn, New York who writes for
various publications and organizations, \"Paris Climate Agreement,\"

https://www.nrdc.org/stories/paris-climate-agreement-everything-you-need-know)

[[There's a lot of **misinformation**]{.underline}]{.mark} out there
[[about the Paris Agreement, including the idea]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[it will hurt the U.S. economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. That was
among a number of unfounded [claims [Trump repeated in his 2017]{.mark}
Rose Garden [address, arguing]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the accord
would cost the U.S. economy \$3 trillion by 2040]{.underline}]{.mark}
and \$2.7 million jobs by 2025, making us less competitive against China
and India. But [[as **fact checkers** noted]{.mark}, these [statistics
originated from a **debunked** March 2017 study that
exaggerated]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[future costs of emissions
reductions]{.underline}, [underestimated advances
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [energy [efficiency and clean]{.mark} energy
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies, and outright ignored the huge health
and economic costs of climate change itself.

In fact, research makes clear that [[the cost of climate inaction far
outweighs the cost]{.underline}]{.mark} of reducing carbon pollution.
One recent study suggests that [[if the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[failed to meet its Paris climate goals,
it could cost the economy as much as \$6 trillion]{.mark} in the coming
decades]{.underline}. A worldwide failure to meet the NDCs currently
laid out in the agreement could reduce global GDP more than 25 percent
by century's end. Meanwhile, another study estimates that meeting---or
even exceeding---[[the Paris goals]{.mark} via [infrastructure
investments in both clean energy and energy efficiency could have major
global rewards]{.mark}]{.underline}---to the tune of [[some \$19
trillion.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In terms of employment, [[the clean energy sector]{.mark} already
[employs more than 3 million Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}---about [[14
times the number of coal, gas, oil, and other fossil fuel industry
workers]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[and]{.mark} has [the potential to
employ many more]{.mark}]{.underline} with further investments in energy
efficiency, renewable energy, and electric grid modernization to replace
the aging coal-powered infrastructure. Indeed, moving forward with the
Clean Power Plan alone could deliver more than a half-million new jobs
by 2030. Meanwhile, coal jobs aren't so much being transferred "out of
America"---another Trump claim---as they are falling victim to market
forces as renewable and natural gas prices decline.

Finally[, [rather than giving China and India a
pass]{.underline}]{.mark} [to pollute]{.underline}, as Trump claims,
[[the pact represents the first time those two]{.mark} major developing
economies [have agreed to concrete and ambitious climate
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both countries, which are already
poised to lead the world in renewable energy, have made significant
progress to meet their Paris goals. And since Trump announced his intent
to withdraw the United States from the accord, the leaders of China and
India have reaffirmed their commitment and continued to implement
domestic measures toward achieving their targets.

#### Leaving the climate accord doesn't impact credibility 

**[Ponnuru 17]{.underline}** (Ramesh Ponnuru is an American conservative
political pundit and journalist. He is a senior editor for National
Review magazine, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute,
a columnist for Bloomberg View, and a contributing editor to the
domestic policy journal National Affairs, "Reaction to Trump pulling out
of Paris climate agreement is overblown," THE DENVER POST
https://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/02/reaction-to-trump-pulling-out-of-paris-climate-agreement-is-overblown/)

[[Reactions to]{.underline}]{.mark} President Donald Trump's
[[withdrawal from the Paris accord]{.underline}]{.mark} on climate
change [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} --- forgive me ---
[[overheated]{.underline}]{.mark}. The ACLU is calling it an "assault on
communities of color," for some reason, and environmental activist Tom
Steyer says it's a "traitorous act of war against the American people."
For his part, Trump says that staying in the agreement would have
assured us a future of "lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories and
vastly diminished economic production."

Yet Trump and his critics alike know that very little in the accord is
binding on the parties to it. As a result, withdrawing from it can't
have major consequences by itself.

Listen carefully to the agreement's supporters, and their real argument
becomes clear: For them, staying in it increases the likelihood that the
world's governments will take future steps to avert what they believe
will be a climate catastrophe.

The best argument for leaving, meanwhile, is that [[these steps would be
costly overreactions]{.mark} to that threat]{.underline} --- and
reducing such consequences is a good thing. The risk that
[[climate]{.underline} [change]{.underline}]{.mark} will have
catastrophic effects [[justifies investing to predict, mitigate and
adapt to those effects. It doesn't justify restrictions on the use of
energy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The argument that leaving the Paris agreement will jeopardize
America's global leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[seems
overblown]{.underline}. [The decision dismays many
people]{.underline}]{.mark} around the world, to be sure, [[just as
other American decisions have dismayed many]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
same people over the years. We are told that other governments will no
longer trust America to keep its commitments. But it would not be a bad
thing for other countries to learn that a president's say-so can't
always bind future presidents.

[[It's a mistake]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [[to see Trump's decision as
a turn toward isolationism. It's true that the step cheers those in his
coalition who want the U.S. to weaken its alliances and enact tariffs.
But]{.mark}]{.underline} it also [[has the support of conservatives and
Republicans who oppose those policies]{.underline}]{.mark}. That breadth
of support helps explain why Trump made this move while so far
refraining from tearing up NAFTA and the like.

Trump has even talked, albeit very vaguely and implausibly, about
renegotiating the Paris agreement. It would be better to take a
different path altogether. [[But we are free to go in any number of
directions, since we are essentially in the same place we were when we
were in the agreement]{.underline}.]{.mark}

### 2NC -- AT: Solvency -- Sci Dip

#### Scientific diplomacy fails to achieve legitimate diplomatic goals **[Dickson 10]{.underline}** (David is a science journalist and director of SciDev.net, "Science in diplomacy: 'On tap but not on top'", Science and Development Network, 6/28/10 [http://scidevnet.wor\...onference-2010/](http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/))

[[There's a general consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} in both the
scientific and political worlds [that [the principle of science
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least in the somewhat restricted
sense of the need to get more and better science into international
negotiations, [[is]{.mark} a [desirable]{.mark} objective. [There is
less agreement]{.mark}, however, [on how far the concept
can]{.mark}]{.underline} -- or indeed should -- [[be extended to embrace
broader goals]{.mark} and objectives, [in particular attempts to use
science to achieve political or diplomatic goals]{.mark} at the
international level.]{.underline} [S[cience]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
despite its international characteristics, [is no substitute for
effective diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Any more than diplomatic
initiatives necessarily lead to good science. These seem to have been
the broad conclusions to emerge from a three-day meeting at Wilton Park
in Sussex, UK, organised by the British Foreign Office and the Royal
Society, and attended by scientists, government officials and
politicians from 17 countries around the world. The definition of
science diplomacy varied widely among participants. Some saw it as a
subcategory of "public diplomacy", or what US diplomats have recently
been promoting as "soft power" ("the carrot rather than the stick
approach", as a participant described it). Others preferred to see it as
a core element of the broader concept of "innovation diplomacy",
covering the politics of engagement in the familiar fields of
international scientific exchange and technology transfer, but raising
these to a higher level as a diplomatic objective. Whatever definition
is used, three particular aspects of the debate became the focus of
attention during the Wilton Park meeting: how science can inform the
diplomatic process; how diplomacy can assist science in achieving its
objectives; and, finally, how science can provide a channel for
quasi-diplomatic exchanges by forming an apparently neutral bridge
between countries. There was little disagreement on the first of these.
Indeed for many, given the increasing number of international issues
with a scientific dimension that politicians have to deal with, this is
essentially what the core of science diplomacy should be about. Chris
Whitty, for example, chief scientist at the UK's Department for
International Development, described how knowledge about the threat
raised by the spread of the [highly damaging plant disease stem
rust ](http://www.scidev.net/en/news/deadly-wheat-disease-a-threat-to-world-food-secur.html)had
been an important input by researchers into discussions by politicians
and diplomats over strategies for persuading Afghan farmers to shift
from the production of opium to wheat. Others pointed out that the
scientific community had played a major role in drawing attention to
issues such as the links between chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere
and the growth of the ozone hole, or between carbon dioxide emissions
and climate change. Each has made essential contributions to policy
decisions. Acknowledging this role for science has some important
implications. No-one dissented when Rohinton Medhora, from Canada's
International Development Research Centre, complained of the lack of
adequate scientific expertise in the embassies of many countries of the
developed and developing world alike. Nor -- perhaps predictably -- was
there any major disagreement that diplomatic initiatives can both help
and occasionally hinder the process of science. On the positive side,
such diplomacy can play a significant role in facilitating science
exchange and the launch of international science projects, both
essential for the development of modern science. Europe's framework
programme of research programmes was quoted as a successful advantage of
the first of these. Examples of the second range from the establishment
of the European Organisation of Nuclear Research (usually known as CERN)
in Switzerland after the Second World War, to current efforts to build a
large new nuclear fusion facility (ITER). Less positively, increasing
restrictions on entry to certain countries, and in particular the United
States after the 9/11 attacks in New York and elsewhere, have
significantly impeded scientific exchange programmes. Here the challenge
for diplomats was seen as helping to find ways to ease the burdens of
such restrictions. The broadest gaps in understanding the potential of
scientific diplomacy lay in the third category, namely the use of
science as a channel of international diplomacy, either as a way of
helping to forge consensus on contentious issues, or as a catalyst for
peace in situations of conflict. On the first of these, some pointed to
recent climate change negotiations, and in particular the work of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as a good example, of the way
that the scientific community can provide a strong rationale for joint
international action. But others referred to the failure of the
Copenhagen climate summit last December to come up with a meaningful
agreement on action as a demonstration of the limitations of this way of
thinking. It was argued that this failure had been partly due to a
misplaced belief that scientific consensus would be sufficient to
generate a commitment to collective action, without taking into account
the political impact that scientific ideas would have. Another example
that received considerable attention was [the current construction of a
synchrotron facility
SESAME](http://www.scidev.net/en/news/middle-east-synchrotron-gets-the-goahead.html)in
Jordan, a project that is already is bringing together researchers in a
range of scientific disciplines from various countries in the Middle
East (including Israel, Egypt and Palestine, as well as both Greece and
Turkey). The promoters of SESAME hope that -- as with the building of
CERN 60 years ago, and its operation as a research centre involving, for
example, physicists from both Russia and the United States -- SESAME
will become a symbol of what regional collaboration can achieve. In that
sense, it would become what one participant described as a "beacon of
hope" for the region. But others cautioned that, however successful
SESAME may turn out to be in purely scientific terms, its potential
impact on the Middle East peace process should not be exaggerated.
Political conflicts have deep roots that cannot easily be papered over,
however open-minded scientists may be to professional colleagues coming
from other political contexts. Indeed, [there was even a warning that in
the developing world, [high profile scientific projects, particular
those with explicit political backing, could end up doing damage]{.mark}
by inadvertently favouring one social group over
another.]{.underline} Scientists should be wary of having their prestige
used in this way; those who did so could come over as patronising,
appearing unaware of political realities. Similarly, [those who hold
science in esteem as a practice committed to promoting the causes of
peace and development were reminded of the need to take into account how
[advances in science -- whether nuclear physics or genetic
technolog]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark} -- [[have]{.mark} also [led to
new types of weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nor did science
automatically lead to the reduction of global inequalities. "Science for
diplomacy" therefore ended up with a highly mixed review. [The consensus
seemed to be that [science]{.mark}]{.underline} [[can prepare the ground
for diplomatic initiatives]{.mark} -- and]{.underline} benefit
from diplomatic [agreements ]{.underline}-- [[but cannot provide]{.mark}
the [solutions]{.mark} to either]{.underline}. "On tap but not on top"
seems as relevant in international settings as it does in purely
national ones. With all the caution that even this formulation still
requires.

[[If carried out]{.underline}]{.mark}, the energy [[regulations agreed

harm]{.underline}]{.mark} American [[manufacturing, and destroy \$2.5

In withdrawing from the agreement, [[Trump removed
a]{.underline}]{.mark} massive [[barrier to achieving]{.mark} the [3
percent econ]{.mark}]{.underline}omic [[growth rates]{.mark} America is
accustomed to.]{.underline}

Simply rolling back the Paris regulations isn't enough. The Paris
Agreement would have extended long beyond the Trump administration, so
remaining in the agreement would have kept the U.S. subject to its
terms.

Those terms require countries to update their commitments every five
years to make them more ambitious, starting in 2020. [[Staying]{.mark}
in the agreement [would have prevented the U.S. from backsliding or even
maintain the]{.mark}]{.underline} Obama administration's [[initial
commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by
26 to 28 percent.

[[It's a bad deal for the developing world]{.underline}
[if]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[countries choose to
deny]{.underline}]{.mark} [their citizens [affordable, reliable energy
sources]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sure, some of these countries may receive
money to build new renewable-energy generation, but mandating a shift
away from natural resources that power 80 percent of the world is going
to make them worse off.

Despite arguments to the contrary, [[Trump's
withdrawal]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Paris Agreement [[is not about
prioritizing the economy over the planet]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather,
the administration recognized that [[the climate accord is a]{.mark}
costly [non-solution]{.mark}, regardless of one's position]{.underline}
on climate change.

It's no surprise that many countries are talking the climate talk, but
not walking the walk. The true nature of the agreement has been revealed
by the contradictory actions of other nations.

The wishful platitudes and ambitious goals of the Paris climate
agreement have begun to meet the realities of a complex,
energy-dependent world.

The stark reality is that healthier economies mean more energy use, and
consequently, rising emissions (though not always). When economies were
in a slump, it was easier to commit to emissions reductions. When
countries' economies began to grow, many saw emissions rise.

[about]{.underline}]{.mark} the increased [possibility of **[large-scale

More worryingly, [in the **current political landscape**]{.underline},

chauvinistic **[ethno-[populism]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as well

**[spin out of control]{.mark}** and 'morph' [into]{.mark}]{.underline}
military conflict, and worse, **[[world war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Crisis responses limited

The 2008-2009 global financial crisis almost 'bankrupted' governments
and caused systemic collapse. Policymakers managed to pull the world
economy from the brink, but soon switched from counter-cyclical fiscal
efforts to unconventional monetary measures, primarily 'quantitative
easing' and very low, if not negative real interest rates.

But while these [monetary [interventions]{.mark}]{.underline} averted
realization of the worst fears at the time by turning the US economy
around, they [[did little to address **underlying**]{.mark} economic
**[weaknesses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, largely due to the ascendance of
finance in recent decades at the expense of the real economy. Since
then, despite promising to do so, policymakers have not seriously
pursued, let alone achieved, such needed reforms.

Instead, ostensible structural reformers have taken advantage of the
crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts to further 'casualize'
labour markets. This [lack of **structural reform**]{.underline} [has
meant]{.underline} that the [unprecedented **[liquidity]{.mark}**
central banks injected into economies [has **not been well
allocated**]{.mark}]{.underline} to stimulate resurgence of the real
economy.

From bust to bubble

Instead, easy credit raised asset prices to levels even higher than
those prevailing before 2008. US house prices are now 8% more than at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, while its price-to-earnings
ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in 2008 and in 1929, when the
Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great Depression.

As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, another economic
crisis --- possibly more severe than the last, as the economy has become
less responsive to such blunt monetary interventions --- is considered
likely. A decade of such unconventional monetary policies, with very low
interest rates, has greatly depleted their ability to revive the
economy.

The implications beyond the economy of such developments and policy
responses are already being seen. Prolonged economic distress has
worsened public antipathy towards the culturally alien --- not only
abroad, but also within. Thus, [another round of [economic stress is
deemed likely to foment **unrest**]{.mark}, **[conflict]{.mark}**, [even
**war**]{.mark} as it is **blamed** on the **foreign**]{.underline}.

International trade shrank by two-thirds within half a decade after the
US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, at the start of the Great
Depression, ostensibly to protect American workers and farmers from
foreign competition!

Liberalization's discontents

Rising [economic insecurity, inequalities and deprivation are expected
to strengthen ethno-populist and jingoistic nationalist sentiments, and
**increase**]{.underline} social **[tensions]{.underline}** and turmoil,
especially among the growing precariat and others who feel vulnerable or
threatened.

Thus, [[ethno-populist]{.mark} inspired chauvinistic [**nationalism**
may exacerbate tensions]{.mark}, [leading to
**conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} and tensions [among countries, [as in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[19[30s]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[**Opportunistic leaders** have been **blaming**]{.mark} such
[**misfortunes** on **outsiders**]{.mark}]{.underline} and may seek to
reverse policies associated with the perceived causes, such as
'globalist' economic liberalization.

Policies which successfully check such problems may reduce social
tensions, as well as the likelihood of social turmoil and conflict,
including among countries. However, these may also inadvertently
exacerbate problems. The recent spread of anti-globalization sentiment
appears correlated to slow, if not negative per capita income growth and
increased economic inequality.

To be sure, globalization and liberalization are statistically
associated with growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism.
Declining real incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently
strengthened ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening
economic liberalization itself, both within and among countries.

Insecurity, populism, conflict

Thomas Piketty has argued that a [[**sudden increase** in]{.mark} income
[**inequality** is]{.mark} often [followed by]{.mark} a **[great
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although causality is difficult to prove,
with wealth and income inequality now at historical highs, this should
give cause for concern.

Of course, other factors also contribute to or exacerbate civil and
international tensions, with some due to policies intended for other
purposes. Nevertheless, even if unintended, [[such]{.mark} developments
[could **inadvertently catalyse** **future**]{.mark} crises and
**[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Publics often have good reason to be restless, if not angry, but the
emotional appeals of ethno-populism and jingoistic nationalism are
leading to chauvinistic policy measures which only make things worse.

At the international level, despite the world's unprecedented and still
growing interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed as the US increasingly resorts to unilateral, sovereigntist
policies without bothering to even build coalitions with its usual
allies.

Avoiding Thucydides' iceberg

Thus, protracted economic distress, economic conflicts or
**[[another]{.mark} financial [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[could
lead to **military confrontation**]{.underline}]{.mark} by the
protagonists, [[even if **unintended**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Less than a
decade after the Great Depression started, the Second World War had
begun as the Axis powers challenged the earlier entrenched colonial
powers.

[[Smaller]{.underline}]{.mark}, less developed [[countries have not been

[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, in its commitment to reduce greenhouse

"[[Given]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[future economic

the [[peaking of emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} in Pakistan [[is
expected to take place much beyond the year 2030]{.underline}]{.mark}.
An exponential increase of \[greenhouse gas\] emissions for many decades
is likely to occur before any decrease in emissions can be expected."

Even some of the most climate progressive nations on earth have
struggled as well.

[[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}, a world leader on climate action, [[has
failed to cut emissions and has]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[seen
emissions rise]{.underline}]{.mark} during the past two years. [[Germany
may]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[have to buy its way
out]{.underline}]{.mark} of a binding European Union agreement to lower
emissions in the coming years.

In Brazil, emissions in most sectors are expected to rise at least until
2030. In Japan, political issues with nuclear energy will likely cause
the use of coal for energy to increase by 2030. Poland and South Korea
also have plans for coal expansions.

Compliance with the Paris Agreement globally has been nothing short of
dismal. In fact, [[most nations will soon fail to
meet]{.underline}]{.mark} their agreement-defined
[[deadlines]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A generation has passed since the signing of the Oslo Accords between
Israel and the Palestinians. The [Oslo Accords were guided by the
concept that the two-state solution would finally resolve the
conflict]{.underline}---[but two decades later, Israelis and
Palestinians remain caught in a sad, frustrating and vicious cycle that
must be broken]{.underline}. Dramatic events in [the Middle

long-term strategic interests**]{.underline}:]{.mark} [[blocking
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s expansion; fostering
[[stability]{.underline}]{.mark}; and [[diminishing militant
Islam]{.underline}]{.mark}ic momentum.

[A]{.underline} constructive [[breakthrough]{.mark} [requires]{.mark} an
**[outside-the-box approach]{.mark}**]{.underline} based upon three
major premises. [First]{.underline}, it is time to [[cast
aside]{.underline}]{.mark} the concept of [[an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement in favor of an Israeli-Arab agreement]{.underline}]{.mark} as
the only way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[Jordan, Egypt

In order to implement this solution, [the [first]{.mark} phase must

timeframe. [[PNA must]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[restore its control
over]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Gaza]{.underline}]{.mark} Strip. [GCC
military forces should deploy in]{.underline} the [Gaza]{.underline}
Strip [[together with PNA]{.underline}]{.mark} forces, and [[Hamas'
military]{.mark}]{.underline} force [should be merged

[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Rafah]{.underline}]{.mark} crossing
[shall be opened.]{.underline}

Once stability is obtained in the Gaza Strip, negotiations regarding the
final Israeli-Arab agreement should begin. The negotiations should
address all relevant issues (borders, refugees, Jerusalem, settlements,
land and natural resources use, etc.) This plan is likely to succeed
because ending the conflict is a strategic interest of the GCC, Egypt
and Jordan---and they have the keys needed to succeed. The plan echoes
core ideas of the Saudi peace initiative, yet also reflects the dramatic
changes that took place in the Middle East since (Hamas\' takeover of
the Gaza Strip, the outbreak of events in the Arab world, the war in
Syria, the emergence of ISIS, the widening and intensifying Iran-Arab
power struggle, the Vienna agreement). The plan also addresses the core
challenges that perpetuate the vicious cycle of violence and conflict
that confront Israelis and Palestinians[.]{.underline}

Security is the most important issue to Israel. Due to the increasing
threat to Israeli civilians posed by Hamas and other militant Islamist
Palestinian groups, Israelis do not trust Palestinians and are thus
unwilling to make any concessions that will further compromise Israel\'s
security. The involvement of Arab states as reliable counterparts will
strengthen Israeli willingness to compromise if they have reason to
believe that a stable and enduring agreement is
achievable[.]{.underline}

On the Palestinian side, a lack of internal consensus remains
challenging---especially the ideological and political gaps between the
two major Palestinian camps, Hamas and Fatah. As a result, Palestinians
are unable to make inevitable compromises[.]{.underline}

Hamas\' extreme ideology holds all sides hostage. Ironically, its
extremism also holds Hamas itself hostage. Hamas desperately needs a
ladder that enables it to adopt a more pragmatic approach that will
allow it to compromise its control in Gaza without formally compromising
its ideology. The involvement of proactive Arab states will provide that
crucial ladder[.]{.underline}

Arab involvement will also enable Palestinians to exit the Cul-de-Sac by
broadening the consensus base; Palestinians can digest compromises on
issues that are at the core of a Palestinian narrative (primarily the
Palestinian narrative known as the right of return, that is totally
unacceptable to Israel) if this is done within a larger Arab consensus
framework[.]{.underline}

Hopelessness and endless conflict can be replaced by a peaceful future,
but only if we act differently. We must put aside the concept of an
Israeli-Palestinian agreement in favor of an Israeli-Arab agreement as
the only realistic means to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Such
agreement is achievable today more than ever before.Hopelessness and

Recent Attacks Reinforce Reality that Borders Cannot Contain Extremism,
Says Secretary-General's Special Coordinator for Peace Process The
abhorrent terrorist attacks in Paris, Beirut and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula
reinforced the reality that the extremism and terrorism infecting many
parts of the Middle East was not constrained by borders, and that [the
[Israeli-Palestinian conflict could not be separated from the global
threat of terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Secretary-General's
Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process told the Security
Council this morning. "Establishing a Palestinian State, while
[[addressing Israel's substantial security
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[would yield major dividends]{.mark} not
only for Israelis and Palestinians alike]{.underline}, [but **[for the
entire region]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Nickolay Mladenov said while
briefing Council members, via video-teleconference from Jerusalem, on
the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
Over the past month, Palestinians had carried out 35 reported attacks,
including stabbings, shootings and car-rammings against Israelis inside
Israel and in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The attacks had
left six Israelis dead and 36 injured. He went on to say that the two
apparent sniper attacks in Hebron on 10 November and the drive-by
shooting south of that city on 13 November were worrying signs of
escalation from knives to firearms. Of the suspected Palestinian
assailants, 24 had been killed. In clashes across the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip, 11 Palestinians had been killed and more than 3,500 injured,
with seven others wounded in settler-related violence, he added. Calling
upon political, community and religious leaders on all sides to speak
out against terror and all forms of violence, he said the epicentre of
violence had moved to Hebron, which had holy sites revered by both
Muslims and Jews. [Hebron was]{.underline} also [the heart of the
Palestinian economy]{.underline} [and an industrial and commercial
engine, but its streets were barricaded and unnaturally cut
off]{.underline}, he said. Over the past 20 years, the city's
Palestinian and Jewish populations had been physically separated, he
noted, adding that [[the economic impact of]{.mark} the current
[violence had been severe for the entire distric]{.mark}t.]{.underline}
However, [ending the violence]{.underline} and de-escalating the overall
situation [in Jerusalem, Hebron and other areas could not be achieved
through security measures alone]{.underline}, he cautioned. [[**All
parties must play a part** in implementing measures]{.underline}]{.mark}
that could have a positive impact, including immediate efforts by all
political, religious and community leaders to stop the hate-fuelled
incitement that glorified the murder of Jews or branded all Palestinians
terrorists. The recent understandings on upholding the status quo at
Haram al‑Sharif/Temple Mount should be implemented and the apparent
impunity favouring settler violence should be addressed, he said,
emphasizing that the sanctity of burial rituals must be recognized and
Hebron's main commercial artery, Al Shudada Street, re-opened. Security
coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority must be
bolstered and Israeli security forces should only use firearms to
address imminent threats of death or serious injury. The reality in
which a settler State was emerging in the occupied West Bank must be
reversed if hope for a two-State solution was to be reignited, he
stressed. Concerned about the decision to issue tenders for 436 housing
units in the East Jerusalem settlement of Ramat Shlomo, he said the five
punitive house demolitions were equally worrisome. "I reiterate that
settlement activity and punitive demolitions are illegal under
international law," he said, expressing concern that Israeli forces had
carried out several raids in hospitals, including in East Jerusalem and
Hebron. Turning to Gaza, he said the security situation there had been
relatively calm, despite three fatalities resulting from clashes near
the border fence. Seven rockets had been fired towards Israel, and the
Israel Defense Forces had responded with six air strikes and three
incursions into Gaza. In a worrying development, Israel had intercepted
450 litres of TDI (toluene diisocyanate), a substance that could be used
for the production of rockets. Noting that the Gaza Reconstruction
Mechanism continued to function effectively, he said that Israel had
removed aggregate from the list of dual-use materials, but had added
other items to the list during the year, including timber. Pointing out
that such additions hindered Gaza's reconstruction process, he called
upon Israel to reconsider that decision. He said that although current
conditions made a return to negotiations a challenging prospect, the
parties and their international partners must pursue measures that would
significantly improve the lives of Palestinians, including by
strengthening their institutions, economic prospects and security. That
would [require Israel to make substantial policy changes]{.underline} on
the ground. [[The Middle East Quartet remained **the principal
international entity** to support negotiations]{.underline} [towards a
comprehensive and just resolutio]{.underline}]{.mark}[n]{.underline} of
the conflict, he said, requesting that the Council provide any
additional guidance on developing a new peace architecture. More
broadly, he said, the Secretary-General was encouraged that the
international community had finally re-engaged in the search for a
political settlement to the conflict in Syria, based on the transition
elements of the 2012 Geneva communiqué. [It was important that [key
international and regional players]{.mark}]{.underline} [[follow through
on]{.mark} commitments to press their [Syria]{.mark}n
allies]{.underline} to engage in all areas. "This is [vital]{.underline}
in order [to]{.underline} give [political backing, leverage and
credibility]{.underline} to our efforts," he added. Turning to the
occupied Golan, he said the volatile situation there was marked by
clashes between Syrian Government forces and armed groups, as well as
continued air strikes in Ufaniyah, Jabbata Al Khashab and Al Baath, in
the central part of the separation area. On 13 October, the Israel
Defense Forces had notified the United Nations Disengagement Observer
Force (UNDOF) that it had retaliated to spill-over fire from the Bravo
side by firing three missiles at Syrian armed forces in the limitation
area. Noting that UNDOF had not observed the alleged firing from the
Bravo side, he warned that such incidents could potentially jeopardize
the ceasefire between the two countries. "I refuse to be convinced that
Israelis and Palestinians want to live by the sword and in a state of
perpetual violence," he said, noting that the Secretary-General remained
steadfast in his support for any effort to restore the hope that a
two-State solution could be achieved through negotiations. "But [[the
long road ahead requires leadership]{.mark},]{.underline}" he said,
underlining that such leadership had been "[glaringly absent to
date".]{.underline}

The seemingly endless [[war between Palestinians and
Israelis]{.underline}]{.mark} isn't only about substantive issues of
borders and land and sovereignty. It [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
essence, [a war of [competing narratives]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
week, as Israelis celebrate 70 years of victory over repeated attempts
to destroy the miraculous rebirth of Jewish sovereignty, and
Palestinians mourn 70 years of defeat, displacement and occupation, each
side clings to its founding story as an affirmation of its very being.
On Monday, Israeli forces shot and killed 59 Palestinians and injured
more than 3,000 during mass protests along the Gaza border --- the
deadliest day since a devastating 2014 war between Israel and Gaza's
Hamas rulers --- which further dimmed the already bleak prospects for
President Donald Trump's hoped-for peace plan. [One reason that [peace
between Israelis and Palestinians has been so elusive]{.mark}
is]{.underline} that the real elements of the conflict --- [[faith,
memory, identity]{.underline} --- [have gone]{.underline}]{.mark}
[largely [unaddressed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Diplomats focus their so-far
futile efforts on the tangible issues dividing the two sides. But
**[[this is a fight over intangibles]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I recently
appeared on a panel with Palestinian reconciliation activist Huda
Abuarquob of the Alliance for Middle East Peace. A member of the
audience asked us: Why can't Israelis and Palestinians forget the past
and look to the future? Huda and I nearly shouted together:
"Impossible!" It was a revealing moment in the disconnect between the
West and the Middle East. For Middle Easterners, Jews and Arabs alike,
we are our stories. We are formed by the cumulative memories of
millenniums; we are contemporaries with our ancestors. Both Arabs and
Jews, for example, cherish our ancient father Abrahim/Ibrahim not as a
mythic patriarch but an extant example of faith and perseverance. And no
less than our exalted memories, we are formed by our collective traumas.
As we enter the eighth decade of the conflict, the two sides are further
apart than ever. Palestinians see spreading West Bank settlements
eroding the chances of a two-state solution. Meanwhile, Israelis witness
the denial of their country's right to exist, conveyed by Palestinian
media, schools and mosques. And with the U.S. Embassy opening in
Jerusalem on Monday, violence in Gaza and the West Bank will likely
intensify. And yet for all the fatalism on both sides, [the Middle East
is in greater flux than ever before**. [Fear of an imperial
]{.mark}**[Iran is drawing together Israel and]{.mark} the Sunni
[Arab]{.mark} world.]{.underline} Israel's massive retaliation against
Iranian military bases in Syria last week was greeted with quiet
satisfaction in Arab capitals. Saudi Arabia's government-controlled
media publishes denunciations of anti-Semitism these days, and Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman has declared there is no Islamic obstacle to
recognizing Israel's legitimacy. He has also publicly faulted the
Palestinian leadership for rejecting Israeli overtures for a two-state
solution. This [radically shifting atmosphere [requires **a new
conceptual language for peace.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Each side will
need to honor the other's narrative. [That means Israelis acknowledging
the shattering of the Palestinian people and the destruction of their
homeland]{.underline}. [That]{.underline} also [means the Arab world
acknowledging the shattering of ancient Jewish diasporas in the Middle
East]{.underline} --- a million Jews forced out so that today they are
scarcely a memory from Yemen to Morocco to Iraq. Along with respect for
the wounds of the past, we need to recognize the maximalist territorial
claims of both peoples. Each can make a compelling case for why the land
between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea belongs by right to
its side. For a Palestinian whose family fled Jaffa near Tel Aviv, what
is now the state of Israel will always be part of Palestine. And for me,
as a religious Jew, the West Bank isn't occupied territory but Judea and
Samaria, the biblical heart of my homeland. But [solving]{.underline}
our [conflict will require each side to contract its maximalist dreams,
a violation of its perception of justice]{.underline}. And each must
acknowledge the sacrifice of the other. [[A successful Middle Eastern
--- **not** a **Western** --- peace process would]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[draw on religious language]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the past,
diplomats tried to circumvent the religious sensibilities on both sides
to reach a "rational" compromise. But for us, [a peace process between
secularized elites lacks legitimacy]{.underline}. Moderate rabbis and
imams must be willing to probe their respective traditions to justify
painful compromise. This is not far-fetched: Meetings between Israeli
and Palestinian religious leaders have quietly occurred even as talks
between political leaders collapsed. Finally, [each side needs to
acknowledge the right of the other to define itself as a people entitled
to national sovereignty.]{.underline} On the Palestinian side, one of
the great obstacles to peace is accepting that the Jews aren't just
members of a religion but a people. In conversation with Palestinians at
every level of society, I have repeatedly heard the same refrain: We
have no problem with you as a religious minority, but we can't accept
your invention of yourselves as a nation. On the Israeli side, much of
the right denies the existence of a Palestinian people, insisting that
it is a contrived identity whose sole purpose is to undermine Israel.
Yet the majority that do acknowledge the legitimacy of Palestinian
national identity understandably fear the creation of a Palestinian
state when there is no sign of reciprocity. Without illusions of an
imminent breakthrough, [[Israelis and Palestinians can create an
infrastructure for reconciliation]{.mark} resonant with]{.underline} our
[values and cultures]{.underline}[. **[No outside power, however
well-intentioned, can do that hard work]{.underline}**]{.mark} for us.
We need to hear each other's narratives, and acknowledge that two
rightful claimants share this tortured land between the river and the
sea. Seventy years on, there is still no other choice.

[[Resuming commitments under]{.mark} the [JCPOA would deliver]{.mark}

the [political agreements]{.mark} that it makes with other countries;
[and]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration [was nothing more than an
unfortunate aberration]{.mark} in the American political
system]{.underline}. Nothing has caused more serious damage to U.S.
interests than the growing trust deficit towards the United States. If
states are unable to trust the United States, then not only is U.S.
global leadership severely undermined but the international system that
has been predominate since the end of the Second World War risks
unraveling. By clearly showing the world that the U.S. intends to fully
observe the commitments that it makes, a successor administration can
begin to repair the damage wrought by President Trump. [[Second,
the]{.mark} U.S.'s [re-entrance]{.mark} into the JCPOA [would have
important **non-proliferation** benefits by]{.mark} effectively
[disincentivizing]{.mark} [Iran from exiting]{.mark} the JCPOA [itself
and]{.mark} thus [undoing]{.mark} the [risk of a]{.mark} burgeoning
[**nuclear crisis** in the **Middle East**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In so
doing, the U.S. would ensure the survivability of the tough and
far-reaching constraints on Iran's nuclear program that will be imposed
by the JCPOA through 2030 and beyond[. [Iran's]{.underline}]{.mark}
[nuclear [program does not pose the risks it did in the pre-2015
era]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that is fully thanks to the JCPOA and the
restrictions it imposes. Any policymaker should be eager to return to
the JCPOA and, in so doing, re-secure hard-fought concessions that take
an Iranian nuclear weapon and war with Iran over its nuclear program off
the table for the foreseeable future. [Third, [reentry]{.mark} to the
JCPOA [would signal to]{.mark} the kingdom of **[Saudi Arabia]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} Donald [[Trump's blank check for]{.mark}
their [increasingly brazen behavior is at an end]{.mark}, and that [the
U.S. has alternatives to outsourcing American policy]{.mark} in the
region to an erratic kingdom that]{.underline} -- in the words of Sen.
Lindsey Graham -- [has double dealt on terror]{.underline}. Perversely,
both the Trump administration and numerous Washington pressure groups
have warned that the administration's pressure campaign against Iran
would be jeopardized if the U.S. dared to impose consequences on the
kingdom over the brutal murder of Saudi journalist and U.S. resident
Jamal Khashoggi. Such warnings expose the current administration's
approach to the region as so hopelessly unbalanced that is susceptible
to extortion by one morally bankrupt regime against another. [[The U.S.
needs to move to a **transactional relationship** with]{.mark} both
[Saudi Arabia and Iran]{.mark} where we can impose consequences on each
for such brazen misbehavior]{.underline}. [[In Iran, the U.S. has
sanctioned itself out of influence, whereas with Saudi Arabia the U.S.
is too afraid to use]{.mark} its substantial [leverage to rein
in]{.mark} the kingdom's [destructive course]{.mark}]{.underline} --
[[whether on the]{.mark} disastrous **[war in Yemen]{.mark}** [or
on]{.mark} the kingdom's [mounting **human rights
abuses**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [An alternative is available, and it
should start with re-entry to the JCPOA.]{.underline} Finally, [U.S.
[participation in the JCPOA]{.mark} Joint Commission [would guarantee
**diplomacy**]{.mark} with Iran that does not presently exist amid the
administration's pressure campaign, [and]{.mark} could [lead to
**follow-on negotiations**]{.mark} [addressing]{.mark} the full spectrum
of America's concerns with Iran]{.underline} -- [including [**regional
security** and **h**]{.mark}**uman [r]{.mark}ights**]{.underline}. The
present Trump administration approach of exiting the JCPOA and seeking
its destruction prohibits the U.S. from affecting Iran's calculations on
issues beyond the nuclear file. Any policymaker with justifiable
concerns with Iranian behavior or who seeks political solutions to the
proxy conflicts that have gripped the region should be urging a return
to the JCPOA. [Returning to the JCPOA and **restoring U.S. credibility**
and influence with Iran is unlikely to be without cost, but will not be
nearly as costly as the alternative]{.underline}. The U.S. reneged on
its commitments and, [barring]{.underline} Congressional intervention or
a change of heart from President [Trump]{.underline} himself, [will have
materially breached the accord by snapping back nuclear-related
sanctions]{.underline} for a period of at least 32 months if there is a
change in administration after the 2020 elections. Judging by recent
sanctions designations, as well, [[the Trump administration]{.mark} does
not appear intent to sit idly in the months ahead, but [will]{.mark}
[proceed with]{.mark} a dramatic [expansion of sanctions
designations]{.mark} that may go well beyond previous sanctions
campaigns]{.underline}. These will have a tremendous negative effect on
the Iranian economy and the Iranian people's aspirations, in addition to
the economies of our allies in Europe seeking to comply with the
UNSC-endorsed JCPOA.

the Saudi-owned newspaper [al-Asharq

Secretary of State John Kerry said that the agreement with Iran had
focused exclusively on the nuclear issue. But he added that he would now
consult with his counterparts in the Gulf about ways to engage with
other regional issues. This statement coincided with a visit by Iranian
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the Gulf states, aiming to
reduce the tension caused by the nuclear agreement. Days before his
visit[, Zarif wrote an article entitled "The Neighbor Before the
House"](http://assafir.com/Article/434785/MostRead) (al-jar qabl al-dar)
in the Lebanese newspaper al-Safir, where he argued for better
Gulf-Iranian relations and [suggested Yemen as a model for working
together toward regional peace between the Gulf and Iran]{.underline}.

exert pressure on Tehran to "tame" its Houthi allies in Yemen and,
perhaps most importantly, to provide [guarantees that the Houthis will
commit to any agreements concluded in the future]{.underline}. This
point is all the more important in view of the fact that many Houthi
violations of previous agreements stemmed from the lack of a guarantor
that could pressure the group to comply, given the declining power of
local parties and the Houthis' general indifference toward international
resolutions. [As long as Iran was isolated, it had little reason to
engage constructively with the Gulf Arabs or the West over Yemen. Now,
things may be changing.]{.underline}

turned [Yemen](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Yemen) into one of
the world's worst humanitarian disasters.]{.underline} The bulk of the
criticism has been placed on the Saudi-led coalition as well as the
western countries which arm it. But if we want to achieve peace in the
region we need to start to take into consideration the atrocities the
[Houthi rebels](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/houthi-rebels) have
also committed. In September 2014, Houthi rebels, who only represent a
small minority of the population in Yemen, attacked the capital city of
Sanaa and seized it. Many Yemenis called this a coup against the elected
and internationally recognised Yemeni government. [The Houthis were able
to take the capital in just a few days thanks to the backing they
received from

is]{.mark} actually [an economic crescent]{.mark}, [as Shias hold 80 per
cent of the world's oil]{.mark} in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq,
Syria and Iran]{.underline}**." Without understanding this core reason
behind the Houthi offensive, achieving peace in Yemen is nigh on
impossible -- [[any plan to end the war without]{.mark} putting [more
pressure]{.mark} [on Iran to dismantle]{.mark} its [Quds forces is
highly likely to fail]{.mark}, as we've seen since the beginning of this

condemn Saudi
Arabia](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/yemen-civil-war-saudi-arabia-britain-un-security-council-conflict-humanitarian-crisis-a8640731.html)
Houthis are merely a proxy of the IRGC's Quds forces. However, now that
Iran is under intense pressure by the current US administration and its
own people, it can no longer continue to arm and sponsor the Houthis
like before. Consequently, Houthi rebels have been pushed to show
willingness in negotiations for the time being. Nevertheless, it is
important to remember that Houthi rebels have refused to join any peace
talks to end the war in Yemen in the past. According to Kamal Kharrazi,
the head of Iran's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, Tehran is
negotiating with European countries about the Yemen crisis and,
according to Iranian media, the war was the top priority of the
discussion between British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Iranian
officials on Monday. Children suffering from acute malnutrition in Yemen
But from the Iranian perspective, a [[ceasefire in Yemen is only
crucial]{.mark} for the time being [because it needs to focus on
domestic economic challenges]{.mark} as the country hopes to ease US

countries where Iran has sought to impose]{.mark} its influence --
namely [Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine]{.mark}, which a[re extremely
divided and unstable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is little reason to
assume Iran's intentions are different in Yemen. This suggests the main
reason behind Houthi rebels announcing halting attacks on the Saudi-led
coalition is linked to Iran's current domestic problems, as opposed to a
genuine willingness to find peace in the region. [[Yemen is not an
isolated war]{.mark} but intrinsically linked to Iran's wider regional
strategy]{.underline}. Unless this aspect begins to be highlighted more
insistently, it is difficult to see any lasting peace in Yemen -- a
treaty could be signed, but [as Iran faces other problems it could
return to destabilizing Yemen because it is a crucial part of Iran's
Shia Crescent into Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} [The death of the face of
Yemen's humanitarian crisis is a wake-up
call](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/amal-hussain-yemen-humanitarian-crisis-war-arms-saudi-arabia-uk-a8616986.html)
It is highly unlikely Iran will stop pursuing its belligerent efforts to
establish its Shia Crescent in the long run because that is the very
essence and purpose of the Islamic regime of Iran. This poses a great
threat to the stability in the region, and threatens Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain which have significant Shia population in their countries.

[The US policy departures in West Asia under Trump are
significant]{.underline} and far reaching but there is a common chord
that links it with the policies pursued by previous administration and
that is to protect American interests and ensure its regional dominance.
Nevertheless, despite adopting the vastly different approaches, [Trump
faces]{.underline} the similar [tests of growing regional and global
challenge to the US predominance in West Asia]{.underline}. [Trump's
policy departures are directed against Iran and concur with the Israeli
and Saudi view of Iran as a state propelling conflicts in the region by
supporting proxies leading to growing Iranian regional
footprints.]{.underline} It is based on the assessment that the nuclear
deal rather than preventing Iranian quest for nuclear weapons allowed
only a delay in its acquisition and let Iran expand its regional
influence at the cost of the USA and its allies. [The changes in the US
policy direction]{.underline} under Trump [will have
long-term]{.underline} impacts [on]{.underline} the Israeli--Palestinian
conflict and are designed to bring a change in the Palestinian attitude
of resisting Israeli occupation and [accepting the peace agreement being
promoted by the USA]{.underline}. [**[Trump's policy departures
sharpen]{.mark} the [geopolitical tensions in West Asia and]{.mark} have
the potential to further [flare]{.mark} [up the]{.mark} already [fragile
region]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} [It will lead]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} new alignments in the region and will force
regional countries including Iran, Turkey, Israel, Egypt and **[[Saudi
Arabia to step up efforts to]{.mark} [safeguard]{.mark} their [interests
and expand]{.mark} their [influence]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}**. At the same time, [it works in favour of Israel
and Saudi Arabia who have been significantly opposed to the Iran nuclear
deal]{.underline}. On the other hand, it creates complications for
countries such as Jordan which will be in a vulnerable position, if it
had to defend a decision such as the US embassy move to Jerusalem. While
regional countries will certainly be affected, the departures in US
policy will have long-term implications for the USA and other global
powers. As far as the regional geopolitics is concerned, Trump's policy
departures are going to have two important impacts. First, it ensures
that despite the declining regional dominance, it remains the most
powerful external player in West Asia. The USA has been the predominant
military power in the region with a number of military bases and
strategic partnerships. It remains the sole security guarantor in the
Persian Gulf as no other country is in a position to commit military in
the region. Nevertheless, with countries such as the UK, France, Russia,
China and Turkey finding ways to enhance their military and strategic
presence in the region, it can no longer claim to be the only superpower
in the region, which it became after the end of the Cold War. Second, it
will increasingly lead to a geopolitical competition among the USA,
Russia and China in West Asia. Moscow has entrenched itself in the
Syrian crisis and built a working cooperation arrangement with Iran on
several regional issues. It is expected to continue working with Tehran
and expand cooperation with countries such as Turkey, Egypt as well as
Saudi Arabia and Israel to ensure its interests are protected. Moscow
has on several occasions demonstrated the desire for working with other
countries in the region to resolve conflicts in Iraq, Yemen,
Israel--Palestine and within GCC countries ([Cook,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0974928418785478)).
Russia's early response to the US withdrawal from the JCPOA strengthens
the position that it will not accept the unilateral withdrawal and work
with other signatories to ensure continuation of the deal ([TASS,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0974928418785478)).
China too has expressed similar views ([Qingyun & Jin,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0974928418785478))
and this means that both China and Russia will look to work with the
European countries to ensure minimal impact of the US withdrawal and
sanctions. China will be moved by its economic and security interests as
it has invested significantly in Iran and with other countries in the
region to promote its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It means that the
emerging global powers will increasingly challenge the US domination in
West Asia. Conclusion President Trump has made three significant policy
departures in West Asia in the first year and half, he (a) has ended the
hands-off policy in Syria; (b) has changed the status quo on Jerusalem
and (c) has withdrawn from the JCPOA. In Syria, it has resulted in a
significant increase in regional competition with Israel and Iran
engaging militarily to counter growing threats and Russia looking to
stabilise the situation and establish peace in favour of the regime. The
Jerusalem decision has flared up Palestinian, Arab and global Muslims
opinion against the USA and has created space for global powers for
manoeuvring in the conflict. [The withdrawal from JCPOA has created
uncertainty about the future of the Iran nuclear deal and forces Iran
and other regional and global powers to re-think their
policies]{.underline}. While Obama looked to pull away from regional
affairs and end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Trump is focused on
revival of the US entrenchment in regional conflicts. Despite the vital
differences between the Trump and Obama policy choices, the outcome so
far as the geopolitical impacts are concerned is the decline in American
dominance due to growing challenges and competitions from emerging
global powers.

Swu

For decades, many foreign policy officials, academics and commentators
across the West and the Arab world have argued that there is a key to
stability and peace in the Middle East[.]{.underline}

For generations, [the [Israeli-Palestinian]{.mark} conflict [has been
portrayed as]{.mark} the [key to]{.mark} making regional]{.underline}
peace. Proponents of this concept have claimed that a solution of the
protracted conflict would pave the way to [[Middle East peace]{.mark},
[less terrorism]{.mark} and [less]{.mark} anti-Americanism, and would
**eliminate [Iran's regional expansionism]{.mark} and nuclear
pursuits**]{.underline}. According to this logic, [if Palestinians had a
state]{.underline}, all the [Arab countries would be]{.underline}come
[secular constitutional democracies]{.underline} run by rulers
[respecting human rights, Turkey would guarantee the right of
self-determination to Kurds]{.underline}, [Iran would cut support for
its proxies]{.underline}, and [militant Salafists would call off their
jihad.]{.underline}

[[There is no]{.mark} similar [case in]{.mark} diplomatic
[history]{.mark} that was **[so misunderstood]{.mark}** by so many
entities [for such a long time]{.mark}.]{.underline} Roots of this
belief can be traced back to British foreign policy by the end of the
1930s. The British believed that their concerns in the region -- such as
access to oil, their relations with the individual Arab countries,
undercutting French positions and keeping Nazi Germany from gaining more
of a foothold -- would play out once the problem of Palestine was solved
to the satisfaction of the Arab countries.

After the Yom Kippur War and the subsequent OPEC oil embargo, US
presidents started repeating this "[Israeli-Palestinian conflict key to
peace" mantra]{.underline}, which became conventional wisdom in the
White House. Jimmy Carter, influenced by Zbigniew Brzezinski, his
national security adviser, formulated that "the US has a vital interest
in the establishment of a stable peace in the Middle East" via solving
the Israeli-Arab conflict.

Even in 2008, after the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War (one of the deadliest
conventional wars ever fought), the Gulf War and the Iraq War, Carter
claimed that "without doubt, the path to peace in the Middle East goes
through Jerusalem," and Brzezinski added that "the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is the single most combustible and galvanizing issue in the
Arab world.["]{.underline}

Although this myth was discredited by other violent events connected
with the Arab Spring, including the Syrian civil war and the genocide of
Yazidis by ISIS, Donald Trump (the same applies for Barack Obama)
repeated it -- thus effectively denying his 2017 National Security
Strategy -- in saying that "if we can make peace between the
Palestinians and Israel, I think it'll lead to ultimately peace in the
Middle East, which has to happen.["]{.underline}

[Unfortunately]{.underline}, this [is not going to happen]{.underline},
since **[[there is no key to Middle East peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This myth is [based on the false assumption that the Middle East is a
highly interconnected structure where the solution of one specific armed
conflict will solve]{.underline} a bunch of [other armed
conflicts.]{.underline}

However, [[the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}, regardless of how one
defines it, [[is]{.mark} an [ethnically and religiously
heterogeneous]{.mark} region]{.underline} characterized by [[many
complexities and fault lines]{.underline}]{.mark} which throughout the
years have [produced multiple intrastate, interstate and transnational
armed]{.underline} conflicts [among countries and violent non-state
actors]{.underline}, [each]{.underline} of which [holds competing,
overlapping]{.underline} and sometimes contradictory
[interests]{.underline}.

Any [[attempt to **simplify affairs**]{.mark} in the region and
**[analyze them through]{.mark}**]{.underline} the lens of **[[one
particular conflic]{.mark}t]{.underline}** (currently via [the proxy
conflict **between Saudi Arabia and Iran**]{.underline}) [[creates the
impression that all conflicts]{.mark} in the region, their
[sources]{.mark} and [solutions]{.mark} [are connected]{.mark} and not
independent.]{.underline}

THIS WISHFUL thinking about some kind of [[domino effect in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} volatile [[Middle East has proved to
be]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[very dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark} game
[[with]{.mark} [disastrous]{.mark} [and long-lasting
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, US president G.W. Bush,
influenced by neoconservatism, launched a [war in Iraq]{.underline}, in
[the belief that regime change]{.underline} in the country [would be a
catalyst for stimulating democratic change that would "domino"
throughout the Middle East.]{.underline}

Henry [Kissinger]{.underline}, former US secretary of state, even
[linked the Iraq invasion with the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict]{.underline}, claiming: "It is not true that the road to
Baghdad leads through Jerusalem. Much more likely, the road to Jerusalem
will lead through Baghdad."

However, the hope for a democratic Baghdad, and so [ending the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, **did not materialize**]{.underline}, [and
post-invasion Iraq has become **a repellent example of a failed state**
defined by widespread political violence, disorder and leadership with
authoritarian tendencies.]{.underline}

Moreover, by ridding Iraq of Saddam Hussein, Washington inadvertently
eliminated Tehran's overriding challenge, thus allowing it to project
its influence in Iraq[.]{.underline}

The Arab Spring demonstrated that the notion of democratic dominoes in
the region is a mirage. Early [hopes for positive shifts in Middle
Eastern politics]{.underline}, while ignoring the lack of democratic
tradition, influence of Islamism, the weakness of secular forces and
widespread poverty, [were profoundly misplaced]{.underline}. Although
the upheavals in 2011 had similar roots, that does not mean that their
outcomes must be the same. The Tunisian revolution inspired other
countries to revolt. Regrettably, its relatively successful [transition
into "flawed democracy"]{.underline} did not become an inspiration for
other countries, such as Syria and Libya, which, rather, [descended into
civil wars]{.underline}.

In February 2019, US Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo said]{.underline}
that ["confronting Iran" is the key to stability and peace in the Middle
East]{.underline}. In truth, increasingly powerful Iran destabilizes the
region with its pursuit of regional hegemony, characterized inter alia
by a policy of systematic interference in other countries -- such as
Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen -- through the sponsorship of local Shia
militias. Iran has mastered the art of proxy wars.

[Although it is important to [stop Iran's aggressive
expansionism]{.mark} and prevent it from building a]{.underline}
contiguous [sphere of influence]{.underline} from its Western border to
the Mediterranean, [**that [still will not be enough to bring
stability]{.mark}, let alone peace**, to the region]{.underline}. Even
if Iran abandons the states, there still will be conflicts ongoing on
their soils. [Iran is an **opportunistic player**]{.underline} that
looks for vacuums in failed states, exploits sectarian conflicts to
increase its influence, while using Shi'ism as the main tool to attract
foreigners to cooperate. These [countries will remain fragmented and
deeply divided, **even without Tehran's presence.**]{.underline}

Needless to say, other countries with hegemonic ambitions in the region
-- namely, Turkey and Saudi Arabia -- have not contributed to stability
either. The list of their stability-undermining activities is difficult
to fathom. Turkey invaded northern Syria in order to prevent the
creation of a Kurdish state. Saudi Arabia trapped itself in the civil
war in Yemen, after invading it in August 2015; and, together with other
Gulf countries, it has helped to worsen conflicts in Syria and
Libya[.]{.underline}

[[Russian intentions]{.mark} in the region are **far from being a
salvation**]{.underline}. Russia tries to brand itself as a problem
solver; however, [its conflict-mediation strategy tends to be effective
[in **freezing disputes** rather than solving them]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This approach is evident in conflicts that Russia tried to handle,
specifically in Abkhazia, Chechnya, South Ossetia, Transnistria or
Ukraine.

Pursuing [[stability]{.mark} in the current Middle East [seems to be
**chimerical**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The region is going through a time
of perhaps unprecedented instability and turmoil -- all enabled by the
fact that [[the region **lacks a collective security framework**]{.mark}
of any kind that would guide local actors [to manage]{.mark} inevitable
[disputes]{.mark} with minimal violence and disruption.]{.underline}

The current regional order is fundamentally one of disorder, and
[pointing out [one simplistic frame **obscures from view the complex
issues plaguing the region.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**There is not one key to** stability in the Middle East]{.underline}.
[It is not]{.underline} the
**[Israel]{.underline}**i[-**Palestin**]{.underline}ian conflict,
[democratic **Iraq** **or pacified Iran**]{.underline}. [[Stability
requires **multiple keys to multiple issues**]{.underline}]{.mark}, what
seems to be a Sisyphean task just to imagine, let alone to do.

thousands during the Syrian civil war, enabling Assad to reverse key
setbacks and turn the tide of war in his favor. Iran sponsors the
violent extremist groups destabilizing Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, and
Bahrain. Iran continues to take Americans and other Westerners hostage,
detaining at least five Americans and six other Westerners since the
nuclear deal was reached. The Iranian regime brutally represses its own

minorities with impunity. [[Iran has test-launched]{.mark} at least [16

to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in the long term and
weakens restrictions on Iran\'s ballistic-missile program and
conventional-arms transfers. Consequently, Iran\'s regional adversaries,
like Saudi Arabia, may race to counter Iran by getting their own nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles and to enhance their conventional-arms
capabilities]{.underline}. Former Saudi Intelligence Minister Turki
al-Faisal warned in 2015: \"I\'ve always said whatever comes out of
these talks, we will want the same. So if Iran has the ability to enrich
uranium to whatever level, it\'s not just Saudi Arabia that\'s going to
ask for that. The whole world will be an open door to go that route
without any inhibition.\" Thus, the chance of destabilizing regional
competition and conflict has increased.

#### The first pulling out of the iran deal killed it -- its too late to recover

Most of the Democrats running for president have promised to rejoin the
Iran nuclear deal if they win the Oval Office. It won't be that easy.
[[By]{.mark} the time Inauguration Day rolls around in [2021, there
might not]{.mark} even [be a deal left]{.mark} --- [it has been hanging
on by a thread since]{.mark} President Donald [Trump pulled the U.S.
out]{.mark} last year. Even [if it still exists, sections]{.mark} of the
2015 agreement [are set to expire]{.mark} in the coming
years]{.underline}, Trump's punishing [[sanctions]{.mark} on Iran [will
be hard to fully unwind, Iran]{.mark} has elections that [could put more
anti-deal hard-liners in power]{.mark} and Tehran has already threatened
to unwind itself from the deal in the months ahead.]{.underline} Then,
[[there's]{.mark} the [possibility]{.mark} that [Iran and the U.S. could
be in]{.mark} a full-blown [military conflict]{.mark}. Democratic
campaign aides acknowledge these challenges.]{.underline} But they
insist that the smartest move, politically and policywise, is for [White
House hopefuls to promise a return to the 2015 agreement. It's a
way[,]{.mark} they said, for candidates to link themselves to a popular
Barack Obama legacy, distinguish themselves from Trump and send a signal
to the world --- including Iran --- that the U.S. will once again be a
reliable partner. "It's moving away from this hysterical way that
Washington talks about Iran, as this uniquely problematic actor that
exists outside the realm of normal diplomacy,]{.underline}" said Matt
Duss, an adviser to Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. The Obama administration
spent years negotiating the nuclear agreement with Iran\'s Islamist
government and global partners. The deal removed numerous international
sanctions on Iran in exchange for severe restrictions on its nuclear
program. Trump quit the agreement last year, arguing that it was too
narrow and time-limited and that it should have covered Iran's
non-nuclear activities, too, such as its support for terrorist groups.
But [[despite using sanctions]{.mark} and other pressure, [Trump has
been unable to lure Iran]{.mark} [into]{.mark} negotiating [a new
deal]{.mark}. If anything, the two countries have been moving closer to
a military confrontation]{.underline}, with each side downing each
other's drones, among other faceoffs.

[[Congressional leaders are split]{.mark}, but not neatly along party
lines, over President Donald Trump's decision Tuesday to withdraw from
the Iran nuclear deal.]{.underline} Some welcomed the pullout, believing
the 2015 accord was unsound, [but [others worried the U.S. was]{.mark}
now in the position of reneging on an international commitment and
without a backup plan.]{.underline} Senate Majority Leader [Mitch
[McConnell]{.mark}, R-Ky., [said]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} Iran [deal
"was flawed from the beginning]{.mark}"]{.underline} and that he looks
forward to working with the president on the next steps. "My own view is
it's a flawed deal and we can do better," he said. "Clearly there's a
next step beyond this and we'll look forward to seeing what he
recommends." [But Senate Minority Leader Chuck [Schumer]{.mark}, D-N.Y.,
who [opposed the]{.mark} [deal]{.mark} negotiated by President Barack
Obama's administration and world powers in 2015]{.underline}, said the
Trump White House appears to have a slogan but no plan. "This is a
little like replace and repeal --- they had these words, they used them
in the campaign, and they don't have a real plan here," Schumer said,
referring to the failed GOP effort to undo the Affordable Care Act. The
administration --- and even Trump himself --- briefed leaders ahead of
Tuesday's announcement. One top Republican, Sen. Bob Corker of
Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also
spoke with European leaders and said he looks forward to negotiating
better terms of the deal. "[[It is disappointing]{.mark} that [the
administration was unable to]{.mark} [reach]{.mark} an
[agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} with our allies," Corker said. "However,
based on conversations I have had in recent days, it is my sense that
the administration will move quickly to work toward a better deal [The
committee's top Democrat, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, said Trump
"is risking U.S. national security, recklessly upending foundational
partnerships with key U.S. allies in Europe]{.underline} and gambling
with Israel's security." Menendez is among a handful of Democrats who
opposed the agreement in 2015. But he said Tuesday that "it is a grave
mistake to walk away ... without a plan for ensuring that Iran does not
restart its nuclear weapon program, without a strategy for countering
Iran's dangerous non-nuclear activities, and without our allies and
partners." The deal put the brakes on Iran's nuclear weapons program for
the next decade in exchange for lifting economically devastating
sanctions. Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions is expected to provoke
a response from Iran that some hope will open negotiations to a better
deal. Others, though, say the outcome is uncertain.

[[A US--China 'grand bargain' may]{.underline}]{.mark} not
[[be]{.underline}]{.mark} im[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark}. For China,
any damage to the prospects of its high economic growth would be
unwelcome. And if a grand bargain restrains aggressive Chinese behaviour
in the South China Sea and East China Sea, it should be welcomed by the
region. We face many great challenges as we seek to manage geopolitical
instability in East Asia. [[The best approach]{.underline}]{.mark} may
be to [[pursue multilayered functional coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}.
This means starting [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} functions. [Find those
[countries that have a common interest in]{.mark} enhancing functional
[coop]{.mark}eration [on a particular issue]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Different areas may require different coalitions for effective outcomes
--- for instance [[trade]{.mark} arrangements, financial cooperation for
[infrastructure]{.mark} investment[, regional
confidence-building]{.mark} measures, [and coop]{.mark}eration [on
environmental]{.mark} and energy [issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} On trade
arrangements, [[there are a number of mega-regional trade initiatives
currently under discussion]{.mark}, such as the [TPP]{.mark}, the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement ([RCEP]{.mark}),
[and the]{.mark} China--Japan--South Korea ([CJK]{.mark}) trilateral
free trade negotiations]{.underline}. While the Trump administration has
withdrawn the United States from the TPP, the remaining 11 members might
work to see what is possible among themselves. The RCEP and a CJK FTA
could help to fill some of the gaps left by the TPP. But the bigger aim
should be to realise a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).
Other trade initiatives should all be utilised as stepping-stones toward
the establishment of an FTAAP. [[On]{.underline}]{.mark} financial
cooperation and [[infrastructure]{.mark} investment]{.underline}, we
have seen [the emergence of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
([AIIB) led by China]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is a positive
development for the region given the huge demand for infrastructure
investment. It is disappointing that [Japan and the United States have
not engaged with the AIIB.]{.underline} [[Both countries should do more
to proactively engage in the creation of infrastructure in the
region.]{.underline}]{.mark} One way [this can be achieved]{.underline}
is [through the [establish]{.mark}ment of [a mechanism to coordinate
coop]{.mark}eration [between the AIIB and other institutions]{.mark}
[such as the Asian Development Bank and the IMF]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Such]{.underline}]{.mark} [coordination [is critical to]{.mark} ensure
that investment in [infrastructure]{.mark} provides the best possible
development gains for the region]{.underline} as a whole. Greater
[[confidence building]{.mark} [among]{.mark} the five powers in
Northeast Asia]{.underline} --- [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,
[China, Russia, Japan and So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline} ---
[[is]{.mark} sorely [needed in order to de-escalate]{.mark} tensions,
defuse nationalism [and build relations rooted in win--win
coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. Confidence building [should initially
focus on the low-hanging fruit of non-traditional security
issues]{.underline}. This [[should include]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[joint establishment of]{.underline}]{.mark} concrete [[mechanisms
for]{.underline}]{.mark} reporting on, [[preventing, and responding to
natural disasters, major industrial accidents, acts of terrorism, and
cyber-attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}. It should also include [[a
commitment to nuclear non-prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. While
these steps may be hard to envision based on what we have seen from the
Trump administration so far, [[operational-level coop]{.mark}eration
[that is already underway]{.mark} in the region [can gradually be
expanded]{.mark}]{.underline} to realise easy wins. There is a pressing
need to tackle environmental and energy issues. Over the coming decades,
the demand for energy will continue to grow exponentially, particularly
in Asia's emerging economies with expanding middle classes, such as
China, India, and ASEAN nations. Regional cooperation ---including joint
efforts in areas such as energy exploration, the development of new
extraction technologies, and the strengthening of nuclear safety
measures---is needed to ensure that the energy demands of all nations
are met. At the same time, the unabated use of fossil fuels will cause
environmental damage detrimental to sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction, not to mention the planet. Intensive cooperation
among nations for jointly funded and developed green energy technologies
is sorely needed. The East Asia Summit and other regional forums should
take up these issues in a more serious manner. The Trump administration
includes a number of climate change deniers while Trump himself has
referred to climate change as a 'hoax.' Friends and allies of the United
States will need to emphasise the importance of environmental and energy
cooperation in their dealings with the Trump administration. Managing
geopolitical instability in East Asia will not be an easy task. There
are understandably great concerns around the region regarding the
uncertainties that the Trump administration brings. [[America's]{.mark}
friends and [allies will need to cooperate, coordinate, and]{.mark}
strive to [make]{.mark} [their views clear]{.mark}ly heard [on the
importance of regional coop]{.mark}eration.]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} interconnected [nature of global and regional
challenges means]{.underline} that [[win-win]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[coop]{.underline}]{.mark}eration [[is necessary more than
ever]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[given the nature of the]{.mark}
globalised [world]{.mark} we live in]{.underline} and the technological
possibilities available to us, [[the potential]{.mark} for win-win
cooperation [is also greater than ever]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through
multi-layered functional cooperation, we can manage geo-political
instability in East Asia and safeguard shared regional peace and
prosperity into the future.

some 18 percent of Chinese goods exports, more than any other single
country, and [roughly two-thirds of China\'s \$3.14 trillion in
foreign-exchange reserves consist of dollar-denominated assets
(PDF)](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/wp/2017/2017-001.pdf).
On the flip side, China is America\'s top trading partner, the
fastest-growing market for its exports and the largest foreign holder of
U.S. Treasury securities. But China has been [making a concerted,
successful push to reduce its dependence on
trade](https://www.ft.com/content/c4df31cc-4d26-11e8-97e4-13afc22d86d4):
the share of total exports in its gross domestic product fell from over
30 percent in 2007 to under 20 percent last year; during that same time,
the share of exports to the United States fell from approximately 9
percent of China\'s economy to just over 4 percent. If Beijing concludes
that trade tensions with Washington are likely to stay, and perhaps even
intensify, it may well take steps to accelerate that trend. America\'s
current trade tensions with a range of other actors---Mexico and Canada
(over the terms of a potential revision to the North Atlantic Free Trade
Agreement), Japan (over the extant trade imbalance) and the European
Union (over the volume of U.S. steel and aluminum imports), in
particular---afford it a compelling set of opportunities to diversify
away from U.S. imports. Meanwhile, the progression of Beijing\'s
flagship economic-cum-strategic project, the Belt and Road Initiative,
will enable it to deepen its footprint and forge new relationships
across a wide swath of Eurasia. China\'s economic heft vis-à-vis the
United States has grown considerably since the global financial crisis.
[In 2008 its GDP was 31 percent as large as
America\'s](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN-US);
in 2016, the last year for which the World Bank reports data, the ratio
was 60 percent. Still,

Ruan Zongze, executive vice president of the China Institute of
International Studies, the Trump administration\'s mid-April decision to
bar U.S. companies from selling components to ZTE highlights China\'s
high level of dependence on the U.S. economy. One of the express
objectives of Made in China 2025 is to unwind that symbiosis---an
imperative that has taken on heightened urgency amid present trade
tensions. Following last week\'s negotiations, economist Eswar Prasad
[observed](https://www.ft.com/content/9f141c6a-4fb4-11e8-a7a9-37318e776bab)
that the U.S. delegation "seems to have had the objective of negotiating
a surrender rather than a truce." Xi Jinping will not accept the former
outcome. Instead, he will maneuver to ensure that China is increasingly
capable of generating and sustaining growth on its own. [[The **less
Beijing depends** on **Washington**]{.mark} economically, [the **more
assertive** it is likely to be in **challenging U.S. foreign
policy**]{.mark}. Of course, the two countries had already been
experiencing growing frictions on a number of issues before the recent
wave of trade tensions: the status of **Taiwan**, territorial claims in
the **South China Sea**, and **internet governance**, **among
others**.]{.underline} But the [United States and China had also
cooperated to shore up macroeconomic stability, tackle climate change,
and bring Iran to the negotiating table.]{.underline} [**A Beijing less
encumbered** by **economic interdependence** might not only **scale
back** such **cooperatio**n but also be more proactive in **undermining
U.S. national interests**---whether by further **undercutting**
**multilateral sanctions** on **North Korea**, strengthening its
alignment with Russia, or more explicitly framing its approach to
governance as a counterpoint to national-level political dysfunction in
Washington.]{.underline} And while China has taken a complex attitude so
far toward the postwar order---strengthening certain elements, weakening
others, and developing parallel institutions such as the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) on the outside---[it may embrace a
more **overtly revisionist posture** if it is not as concerned about the
extent of America\'s economic leverage. [If these shifts occur, they
will do so gradually]{.mark}. It would take far more than the
tit-for-tat retaliation observers presently fear to undo the
interdependence the two countries have accrued in the more than 15 years
since China acceded to the World Trade Organization. But leaders in
Washington and Beijing should recognize that [short-term **trade
tensions**, **left unchecked**, could undermine a **longstanding
ballast** of **bilateral ties** over the long term, with **profound
implications** for **global stability**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AIIB -- Solvency

#### Joining the AIIB promotes US-Sino relations 

**[CFR 16]{.underline}** (Council on Foreign Relations, May 17, 2016.
"Crisis in Global Governance: A Conversation With Richard N. Haass and
the Council of Councils," Council on Foreign Relations.
https://www.cfr.org/event/crisis-global-governance-conversation-richard-n-haass-and-council-councils//KDES).

LEE: And at the same time, you know, there is interesting AIIB, the Asia
Investment Infrastructure Bank, initiated by China. So in Asia, we
thought there is a coming of a kind of competition between China-led
economic and trade or even investment organization versus U.S.-led TPP.
[But I see this is not a good idea if the economic, you know,
cooperations should be work together. So, I think **[it's more rational
for USA to be a member of AIIB rather than]{.mark} just to, you know,
[vetoing]{.mark} AIIB.** So, by [participating]{.mark} in AIIB, you
know, we [can make the governments more democratic and
transparent]{.mark} rather than by (conflict ?).]{.underline} HAASS:
I'll talk about trade. Just on trade very quickly, world trade has not
been growing for about the last five years---very little. And, you know,
more than anything it's because economies aren't growing. But also, it's
now been, what---I lost count of the years, but since, what, 15 years
ago, the Doha Development Round. Global trade talks are going nowhere.
It's not clear they can revive given, you know, any time you try to get
agreement with 190 countries, good luck. And that's the old-fashioned
legally binding approach, very, very tough. So what we're seeing is the
proliferation of regional, and bilateral, and various types of
multilateral trade agreements, which are at best second best. There's
people like Jagdish Bhagwati who think they're actually quite, on
balance, bad. But I would simply say I think they're second best in what
issues they can handle, and I think it comes up against now also the
domestic pushback. So I think it---I think it has been a rough time for
trade. And I think more than anything it's---at the global level you
can't get it negotiated, and at the domestic level it's not clear you
have the support. FULLILOVE: Can I just add one--- MABRY: Sure.
FULLILOVE: Can I just pick up something Professor Lee said about [the
Asian Investment Infrastructure Bank? Because one issue we haven't---we
haven't talked too much about China so far, and everybody in this room
knows that [one of the features of international relations is that
sometimes established and rising powers collide]{.mark}. And [this
relationship]{.mark} between China and the United States [is going to be
very important to]{.mark} many of the [global governance
challenges]{.mark} that we talk about in the report, not just the ones
in Asia but globally. And it seems to me that the United States and
like-minded [countries need to get the right balance of engaging and
hedging with China,]{.mark} and sometimes we get that balance quite
wrong. For example, on the AIIB, I didn't understand why the United
States was so negative about the---about that particular initiative.
Because [if we're not going to allow China the ability to set up some
kind of infrastructure investment bank in Asia,]{.mark} where it's
required, then [what prerogatives are we going to allow
China?]{.mark}]{.underline} On the other hand, I would be---so I think,
in a way, we were---I think the United States was hedging too much in
relation to China. But then on other issues---and we've mentioned the
South China Sea---I would say that President Obama has been too soft. I
would say he's been too down the engagement end. [So this is going to
be, this relationship---these are just examples of this, but this
relationship between the United States and China is going to be so
important. Can the two countries come up---arrive at an order, a new---a
new modus operandi where each of them can achieve their objectives, but
allow the other side to exercise its prerogatives and allow everybody
else in Asia to also exercise their prerogatives? Can they get that
balance right?]{.underline} And the importance of statecraft, and
leadership, and getting the right mix of engaging and hedging, and
choosing where to engage and where to hedge is so hard, which does come
back to leadership.

#### The AIIB is a symbolic starting point for future relations---promotes trust and cooperation

**[Jasper 15]{.underline}** (Daniel Jasper, 8-24-2015, \"Overcoming
Barriers to U.S.-China Cooperation,\" United States Institute of Peace,
https://www.usip.org/publications/2015/08/overcoming-barriers-us-china-cooperation//KDES).

Willingness Although Washington is intent on spreading liberal democracy
and continuing as a global leader, Beijing demonstrates growing
commitment to what President Xi terms \"strive to achieve\"---a more
active involvement in global governance and international affairs.6 This
policy looks to reshape China's traditional approaches to foreign
development assistance, trade, and investment. Washington, on the other
hand, is often willing to step within another state's boundaries to
confront conflict and fulfill what it sees as its responsibility as a
global leader. A willingness gap in the relationship is clear as both
countries struggle to adhere to their foreign policy principles in a
changing global arena. [[Beijing and Washington need to continue to show
flexibility in their foreign policy]{.mark}. [Extreme applications of
principles damage]{.mark} each side and their [ability to
coop]{.mark}erate constructively. Perhaps it is time for them to change
their political narratives and take on their shared role in the
international community**. [The AIIB is one arena for such
coop]{.mark}eration**. Because its rules and guidelines have yet to be
fully defined, the AIIB provides Western states an opportunity to share
experiences with China and China an opportunity to integrate its
approach to development with those that other states have already
developed.]{.underline} Capability The final barriers to cooperation
involve capability. China is newer to the field of peace and
development, has yet to fully establish the AIIB, and has only recently
become a major contributor to UN peacekeeping missions. Meanwhile, the
United States can no longer provide the support needed in least
developed countries, a gap further handicapped by congressional emphasis
on U.S. defense rather than development and humanitarian assistance.
[[China and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can be
complementary]{.mark}. [China is strong in]{.mark} engineering,
construction, and [infrastructure]{.mark}, and the United States is
strong in developing risk and security guidance---areas where Chinese
and Western analysts alike have pointed out key gaps in Chinese
approaches. For optimal impact, the two countries need to coordinate
their development efforts.]{.underline} Conclusion As security tensions
continue to rise in Asia and as China begins launching global
initiatives, [it is imperative that Washington and Beijing find ways to
collaborate.]{.underline} As Beijing academic Wang Jisi recently wrote,
both countries risk seeing the emergence of competing global
institutions, which may result at best in wasted resources and at worst
in deeper conflict and tensions across the developing world. [[**The
AIIB is a possible starting point**. Fifty-seven countries signed the

as a global initiative promising to remake the face of global finance.
Washington might be well advised to engage with the AIIB. Because [the
AIIB will target infrastructure and development projects]{.mark} in
least developed countries and conflict hotspots, its emerging portfolio
is an opportunity for Chinese-U.S. cooperation. Development lending
could prove a minimally politically sensitive testing
ground.]{.underline}

#### Joining the AIIB spills over to US-Sino cooperation in other areas---infrsatructure development, Middle East, US companies 

**[Grossman 17]{.underline}** (Marc Grossman, American former diplomat
and government official. He served as United States Ambassador to
Turkey, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, and Under

Indeed, [[it would be a great advantage to the countries where OBOR
projects are]{.mark} being built or planned if this important DRC
[assertion]{.mark} [-- that the goal of OBOR is to "achieve
participating countries' diversified, independent, balanced and
sustainable development]{.mark}" -- were to [become a transparent policy
objective]{.mark} for everyone involved, including the AIIB]{.underline}
and the BRIC New Development Bank. Beijing would enhance OBOR's
reputation by asking the UN periodically to assess whether or not OBOR
projects are in fact promoting the seventeen 2030 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGS). The US should do the same with NSR. And
measuring OBOR and NSR efforts against the SDGs would be an excellent
topic for US-China consultations if more collaboration is in fact
encouraged. In this case, OBOR/BRI might take a lesson from NSR: many of
America's energy assistance programs in Pakistan are designed to promote
alternative energy production. [If President-elect Trump were to seek
"good deals" for America, here are four advantages which might emerge
from more active US support for the OBOR and NSR
initiatives.]{.underline} First, [if Washington ignores or opposes
OBOR]{.underline} and has amnesia about NSR[, it could end up "denying
both developing Asia and stagnating Europe an important growth engine
while excluding American investors from the benefits of private
investment in major infrastructure projects." Failure by the US to
engage will open the way for China to guide the future of at least
Central, Southeast, and South Asia's geopolitics and geoeconomics,
"impacting almost every aspect of US foreign policy including in some of
the world's hotspots-- the Middle East, South Asia, Eastern Europe and
the South China Sea."]{.underline}14 [**[Getting back in the game should
also mean reversing an Obama policy and joining the AIIB.]{.mark}**
Second, Afghanistan.]{.underline} The September 2016 [US-China Summit in
Hangzhou highlighted Afghanistan as an "area of cooperation." [The US
and China share an interest in an Afghan state in which al-Qaeda and the
Islamic State find no havens]{.mark}, drug exports shrink, and private
sector--based economic activity increases. A coordinated OBOR-NSR effort
to create what Afghan officials once called an "Asian Roundabout" to
encourage a sustainable Afghan economy would promote these shared goals.
The recent opening of a rail line from the eastern coast of China to the
northern Afghan city of Hairatan, offers Afghan exporters an alternative
route to Asia]{.underline} with dramatically reduced transit times.
Robert Kaplan presciently captured the thought in his 2011 book Monsoon,
when he wrote, "Stabilizing Afghanistan is about much more than just the
anti-terrorist war against al-Qaeda or the Taliban; it is about securing
the future prosperity of the whole of southern Eurasia."14 [A third area
of potential cooperation is in Pakistan, where [China and the US want
Pakistan to support regional stability, grow their economy and undermine
extremism]{.mark}.]{.underline} [China's \$51 billion commitment to the
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is designed to build highways,
railways and energy generation in Pakistan, including a proposed rail
and highway between Pakistan's port at Gwadar and China's northwestern
region of Xinjiang, which would also connect the OBOR to China's
Maritime Silk Road project. Pakistanis hope the corridor will create
700,000 jobs by 2030, which should provide alternatives to extremism for
some of Pakistan's 190 million people,]{.underline} a majority of whom
are under the age of 22. Washington and Beijing are already working
together in Pakistan on the clean-energy project Sapphire Wind. The US
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has provided \$128
million in financing for this 50-MW wind project, which uses General
Electric turbines. Under the umbrella of the US-Pakistan Clean Energy
Partnership, the US will invest \$70 million on transmission lines to
connect a 680-MW wind project in Sindh to the national grid. China is
also an investor. In a bilateral contribution to regional connectivity,
the US Agency for International Development funded the construction of
111 kilometers of road needed to complete the N-25 highway and link
Chaman, on the Afghan border, with Karachi through Quetta in
Balochistan. [Fourth, collaborative [NSR-OBOR efforts between the US and
China can bring benefits to US companies.]{.mark} The Wall Street
Journal reported in October that General Electric, Honeywell and
Caterpillar are already focused on the possibilities.]{.underline}
According to the Journal, GE's orders in Pakistan are more than \$1
billion today, compared with less than \$100 million five years
ago.\[15\] [Connecting US firms to OBOR and keeping them aware of NSR
opportunities requires a concerted effort by many parts of the US
government, including the Departments of State and Commerce, OPIC and
the Export Import Bank.]{.underline}

What can bring both sides together again

While the above six flashpoints are certainly reason for concern,
tensions between the world's two biggest economies and militaries need
not sputter into an open shooting contest. [[While there are many areas
of pressure, there are also many areas of potential
coop]{.mark}eration.]{.underline} [[Climate change and saving the
environment should be at the top]{.mark} of talks this
week.]{.underline} If the trade relationship could be made more
equitable and as China transitions slowly from being the world's factory
to a service and ideas economy, there is no telling how deep trade ties
could go. [And [considering **cultural ties** that span generations and
the **millions of Chinese students here in the U**]{.mark}**nited

hikes and other retaliatory measures.]{.underline} Even as Trump moved
Thursday to open a new, potentially damaging trade war with Mexico,
however, [the conflict with China has widened]{.underline} beyond the
original trade-based issues. Beneath the surface, [[a new tone has begun
to emerge since trade talks broke down]{.underline}]{.mark} in early May
and [[Trump ratcheted up tariffs]{.mark} on imported goods from China,
[an action met with **retaliatory duties from
Beijing**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Officials on [both sides of the
Pacific have begun to **portray the U.S.-China relationship in
nationalistic and emotion-charged terms that suggest a much deeper
conflict.**]{.underline} Recently, for example, a private group of
American economists and trade experts with long-standing experience in
China traveled to Beijing, expecting their usual technical give-and-take
with Chinese government officials. Instead, a member of the Chinese
Politburo harangued them for almost an hour, describing the U.S.-China
relationship as a "clash of civilizations" and boasting that China's
government-controlled system was far superior to the "Mediterranean
culture" of the West, with its internal divisions and aggressive foreign
policy. On the U.S. side, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} senior
[[S]{.mark}tate [D]{.mark}epartment [official]{.mark}]{.underline},
during a forum last month in Washington, [[warned of a **deepening
confrontation with China**]{.mark}]{.underline} that she cast in
something close to racial terms. In the Cold War with the Soviet Union,
said Kiron Skinner, the State Department's director of policy planning,
Washington at least faced fellow Caucasians, whereas with Beijing,
Washington faces a nonwhite culture. "[In China we have an economic
competitor]{.underline}, we have an ideological competitor, one that
really does seek a kind of global reach, that many of us didn't expect a
couple of decades ago," Skinner said. "And I think it's also striking
that this is the first time that we will have a great-power competitor
that is not Caucasian." [[On the trade issues]{.mark} themselves, the
[two sides may still be able to reach a truce]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
the best chance coming with the economic summit of major nations at the
end of June in Osaka, Japan. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are
scheduled to attend the meeting of Group of 20 leaders. [[Nothing short
of a deal]{.mark} struck directly by the two leaders [is likely to
**avert new rounds of punches and counter-punches over economic and

ASEAN was formed in 1967, with an agreement by the five original
founding nations -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand -- to organize for the sake of peace, stability and
cooperation. ASEAN states are located at a strategically important
junction, bordering two of the world's most populous economic powers,
China and India, which makes ASEAN a focal point for both regional and
global powers. ASEAN member [[states are]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[enmeshed in territorial disputes]{.mark} with interested
powers.]{.underline} [[China's claim to territories in the S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}, for example, [[overlaps
with]{.mark} competing [claims by Brunei]{.mark}]{.underline}
Darussalam, [[Malaysia, the Philippines and Viet
Nam]{.underline}]{.mark}. While there are challenges, [[closer
coordination and common goals among ASEAN governments
can]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[promote stability and lessen the
prospect of conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} ASEAN is home to a wide
variety of businesses, including a number of huge family-owned
conglomerates and state-linked enterprises, like the [Central
Group](http://www.centralgroup.com/about-us/) in Thailand, Salim Group
in Indonesia, state-linked [Singtel](https://www.singtel.com/) in
Singapore, and [Vinamilk](https://www.vinamilk.com.vn/en/) in Viet Nam.
Yet small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) together with
micro-entrepreneurs make up at least 89% of business activity in the
region. [[Entrenched interests]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [large
conglomerates]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[paired with widespread

The ASEAN region offers a growing market of more than 600 million
consumers. The region's GDP per capita measures about \$6,500 (excluding
Singapore, the region's most advanced economy), which is less than China
but more than India. Consumers in the region are price-sensitive and
demanding, resulting in local businesses with low margins and low labour
costs -- formidable competitors to foreign rivals. One way for new
entrants to adapt and increase profits is to focus on specific consumer
needs and conditions in the region and work backward to develop
solutions. Mobile technologies can be particular useful, especially
given the high mobile adoption rates in the region. [[Government support
can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[ensure companies are encouraged to

Myanmar's \$1,298 in
2017](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=KH-MM-SG).
In recent years, lower-income states have made important gains. However,
regional economic gains have fallen short of erasing significant
differences among ASEAN member states. The World Bank's most recent 2017
edition of the [Global Findex](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/)
showed that while 98% of adults in Singapore and 85% in Malaysia had a
bank account, just 22% of Cambodian adults and 26% Burmese adults did.

threat. Similarly, Chinese watch with concern some of the corresponding
U.S. defense plans. Taken together, these are leading many observers in
both countries to conclude that "strategic competition between China and
the US has loomed large, prompting their relations to take a dark
turn,"12 and that "relations between the U.S. and China are destined to

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and the ripples it has sent
throughout the world[, [it is incumbent to evaluate the condition
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [global capitalism]{.mark} system and to
draft expectations for the future]{.underline}. As moderator, Philip
Stephens remarked that there appear to be three distinct groups in the
post-crisis world: rising countries that appear to still be growing,
established countries like the US which seem to be recovering well, and
European countries growing at a sluggish rate. Global economic and
political bodies have show signs of adapting to fit the new realities of
the global economy, but it is unclear what changes will be made. But the
question emerges, can we continue to have a global financial system
without the tools of global governance?\
Regarding governance issues, Bark Taeho explained that the reason we
don't have a conclusive direction to take is because there is
disagreement between the involved parties. Namely, there are three
fundamental issues. First, there needs to be compromise by large and
rapidly developing nations. Second, less developed countries do not feel
that the World Trade Organization is doing enough on their behalf. And
third, global trade organizations are a public good from which countries
need to feel that all parties can benefit.\
Kwon Goohoon, managing director of Goldman Sachs (Asia), in discussing
the sustainability of the global architecture (like the G20, WTO, World
Bank, and others), cited two areas facing the global market: cyclical
and structural issues. Regarding cyclical concerns, [[the near term
problem is how to get out of the lasting recession]{.mark},]{.underline}
and [[the long]{.underline}]{.mark}er [[term issue is how to
coordinate]{.underline}]{.mark} changes to [[the liquidity markets to
encourage growth while implementing]{.underline}]{.mark} safety
[[mechanisms to avoid another crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Structurally,
[free markets and [democracy are the pillars of the global
economy]{.mark}, and [the challenge is how to employ and balance them
against each other]{.mark}.]{.underline}\
Guy Sorman provided a counter perspective that the free market system is
not the problem but is the solution. Free markets are inherently
unstable, and that is the benefit. Innovation, spontaneous order, and
entrepreneurship are all elements that produce uncertainty but also
drive economic growth. Governments act on political incentives and
therefore often retard economic growth, so we should desire a simple
body that can preserve the rule of law. However, informal and unbinding
associations, such as the G20, should be encouraged because they align
incentives rather than divide them.\
Yang Baoyun, professor at Peking University, explained that, [due to the
integration of the global economic system]{.underline}, the financial
crisis of [[2008 had many implications in individual
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The econ]{.mark}omic [crisis provided
the trigger for many]{.mark} political, social, and even cultural
[issues around the world]{.mark}.]{.underline} The challenge we face is
the politicization of economics. Thus, reform is needed. However, there
is no guarantee which countries will adjust or what the particular
reforms will actually be.

[[What]{.mark} at first [looked like a]{.mark} remarkably [peaceful

overshadowed by splits within the new governing coalition]{.mark} and
the failure to swiftly prosecute former Prime Minister Najib Tun

allegations that [Najib]{.underline} presided over the theft of more
than \$4 million from a state-backed investment vehicle, 1MDB, he [[has
seen a revival in popularity among the]{.mark}]{.underline} majority
[[Malay population.]{.mark} This development,]{.underline} along with
legal tactics delaying the opening of his trial, [has unnerved the
new]{.underline} multiracial [government]{.underline} led by veteran
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and underscored its vulnerability to
fickle conservative Malay sentiment.[In [Indonesia]{.mark},]{.underline}
campaigning for parliamentary and presidential elections due in
mid-April is underway. As stable and routine as the electoral process
has become, with Indonesia having peacefully elected two presidents
since 2004, the worry is that [the country[\'s]{.mark} [increasingly

What these electoral aftermaths tell us is that
[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}, though entrenched, [[is far from

stability.]{.mark}]{.underline}More troubling still are those countries
where the hard struggle for freedom has been reversed.Both Myanmar and
the Philippines have endured protracted struggles at different times to
replace dictatorship and martial law with democracy. Yet both countries
have seen a drastic slide back toward repression under elected
leaders.In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte remains remarkably
popular despite his controversial \"war on drugs\" that has killed
thousands of people, including more than a dozen elected officials. More
recently, Duterte, a former city mayor from Davao, has attacked the
media and stood by as Maria Ressa, the head of the popular news service
Rappler, was arrested, and later released, on charges of
cybercrime.Freedom of expression was one of the earliest dividends of a
gradual transition away from stern military rule in Myanmar after 2011,
so it has been deeply disappointing to see the freely elected government
led by the former democracy and human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi
reverse the trend after she was elected in 2015. In its 2018 World Press
Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked Myanmar 137th out of 180
countries, citing the prosecution of 20 journalists in the past
year.None of these troubling developments appear to threaten any of
these countries with collapse, but they herald trouble ahead.
[[Transparency, government integrity and reducing social inequality are
all important factors that support continued econ]{.mark}omic
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. But governments across Southeast Asia
are failing to deliver on these key indicators. Removing entrenched
privileges for the elite and addressing the yawning income gap that
afflicts the region would go a long way toward dealing with these
problems since elections alone will not do the job. More far-reaching
reforms are necessary.Set against increasing confrontation between China

#### Ending the trade war saps political capital 

**[Griffin 18]{.underline}** -- Kyle; ("Trump Has No Intention of Making
a Trade Deal With China" The Diplomat. September 7, 2018.
<https://thediplomat.com/2018/09/trump-has-no-intention-of-making-a-trade-deal-with-china/>)//GK

[[With China, Trump has found a regular]{.mark} source of
praise]{.underline} and support which spans the political spectrum.
[This consistent]{.underline} and lucrative [**[stream of political
capital]{.mark}** begs the question: What are Trump's incentives to make
a deal to end the trade war?]{.underline} One argument is that he may
seek a deal to avoid damaging the U.S. economy. However, with the U.S.
stock market at a record high, unemployment at 3.9 percent, and GDP
growing at 4.1 percent --- plus the president's ignorance toward the
risks posed by an overheating economy --- this seems unlikely. In
addition, the Trump administration consistently states a willingness to
suffer short-term economic pain for long-term gains. Another argument is
that by concluding the trade war, Trump can claim a big victory. But in
maintaining the dispute, he can claim regular victories across a longer
period. This would provide a welcome distraction from the scandals that
continually dog his presidency. [There is a real chance that Trump's
ostensible desire for a deal with China is a lie. [If the trade war
ends, **the president sacrifices a cash cow of political
capital**.]{.mark}]{.underline} On the other hand, [drawing out the
dispute and leaving any deal-making until after the 2020 election
**could prove an effective re-election strategy.** The strategy would
involve a gradual escalation of protectionist policy measures, which is
exactly what we have seen so far.]{.underline} The escalation of tariffs
has been gradual. A 25 percent tariff on \$50 billion of Chinese goods
was announced on March 22. The tariffs were later broken into two
smaller rounds: tariffs on \$34 billion of Chinese exports were
implemented on July 6, and the remaining \$16 billion was implemented on
August 23. From announcement to realization, the \$50 billion in tariffs
took five months. At this rate of escalation, the trade war will indeed
be a long one. Currently, Trump's administration is drawing up plans to
tariff another \$200 billion in Chinese goods. The duty will be between
10 percent to 25 percent. How this tariff comes into effect will shed
light on whether Trump intends to make a deal. If the tariff is
relatively low at 10 percent, then there is room for a drawn-out
escalation to 25 percent (or higher). This is also true if the \$200
billion, like the first \$50 billion, is broken down and gradually doled
out as smaller tariffs. However, if the \$200 billion is implemented in
full at 25 percent, then Trump may be gunning for a deal. Decision
makers must be cognizant towards the unfolding of either scenario. To
conclude, there's a significant chance that the president has no
intention of making a deal. This is a scenario that nations must heed,
particularly those in East Asia. East Asia is a deeply integrated
regional production network, with China as its platform for final
assembly and export. Therefore, any tariffs that hurt China's growth
will hurt the entire region's growth. To address this threat, East Asian
nations can hedge their bets by planning and preparing for a worsening
and protracted U.S.-China trade war. There are also domestic
consequences for America, besides the economic ones usually trumpeted in
the media. [[By targeting China, Trump has broadened the domestic
support for his toxic brand of economic nationalism. It now appeals
across the political spectrum.]{.mark} His talent as a populist must not
be underestimated.]{.underline}

On March 31, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that [two
[Chinese Air Force]{.mark}]{.underline} (PLAAF) J-11 [[jets **crossed
the**]{.mark} **median line of the [Taiwan Strait]{.mark}.** This
violated the]{.underline} long-held tacit [agreement between China and
Taiwan that **neither side should cross the median line.**]{.underline}
[Taiwan deemed this "an intentional, reckless & provocative action,"
which triggered "a 10-minute standoff" in the air.]{.underline} As Asia
security expert Bonnie S. Glaser notes that, if intentional, this would
be the first PLAAF crossing of the median line in about 20 years. In
this case, it's likely that Taiwan, not the South China Sea, prompted
Beijing's actions. [An unresolved issue from the Chinese civil war,
Taiwan has always been a "core interest" to party leaders in
Beijing.]{.underline} Here are some key takeaways from my research on
China-Taiwan relations. What does the PLAAF move signal? Granted, there
is much we don't know about this specific PLAAF incident. But my work on
cross-Strait relations suggests that it's quite possible the PLAAF
behavior is intentional --- and serves as a coercive signal to Taiwan
and the United States. Here's what you need to know: 1. [[The U.S.
agreed to sell fighter jets to Taiwan.]{.mark}]{.underline} In March,
the United States agreed to sell F-16V fighter jets to Taiwan --- the
fourth-generation model. The last U.S. sale of F-16s to Taiwan took
place in September 1992. \[China-U.S.-Taiwan relations are in choppy
waters. Here's what's going on.\] [[Beijing considers selling weapons
platforms]{.mark} such as jet fighters and submarines to [Taiwan **an
implicit red line.**]{.mark} In the past, China used coercion to deter
countries from selling these weapons platforms to Taiwan.]{.underline}
This suggests that [last week's [PLAAF incident is intended to **send a
deterrent signal about**]{.mark} **fighter [sales]{.mark} to both Taiwan
and the United States.** [The C]{.mark}hinese [F]{.mark}oreign
[M]{.mark}inistry and Ministry of Defense [lodged protests]{.mark}
against the United States regarding the sale, [reiterating]{.mark} that
[China will **"take all necessary measures"**]{.mark} **to resolutely
defend its sovereignty.**]{.underline} The Trump administration decided
on April 5 to put on hold the F-16V deal until the United States strikes
a trade deal with China, suggesting that China may have used the
bilateral trade talks as a bargaining chip.

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- AIIB

#### AIIB isn't key to relations---it has no strategic value and other members outweigh

**[Chen 15]{.underline}** (Dingding Chen is Professor of International
Relations at Jinan University, Guangzhou, China and Non-Resident Fellow
at the Global Public Policy Institute Berlin, Germany. March 22, 2015.
"AIIB: Not a US Loss, Not a Chinese Win," The Diplomat.
https://thediplomat.com/2015/03/aiib-not-a-us-loss-not-a-chinese-win//KDES).

Too much ink has been spilled over China's seeming success in wooing
away the United States' traditional allies to the China-led Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). [Many [analysts]{.mark} (here,
here, and here) [see it as a 'China winning, U.S. losing' story]{.mark},
thereby implicitly [highlighting the confrontational nature of Sino-U.S.
relations]{.mark}. [Such a view is]{.mark} not only too simplistic, but
also **[dangerous for moving Sino-U.S. relations
forward]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While to some degree it is true that
China has scored a political victory by successfully attracting some of
America's traditional allies to the AIIB, [there are three things we
need to consider before we bandwagon with the cliché that China is
rising while the U.S. is declining.]{.underline} The first thing to bear
in mind is that [the AIIB is an economic institution that may or may not
carry strategic implications.]{.underline} While many might be tempted
to view China's AIIB move as a direct threat to the U.S.-led global
financial order, in reality [the AIIB's goals are much more limited. It
is very important for the U.S. not to view the AIIB as a new signal of
strategic rivalry between China and the U.S.; such a distorted view
would assign unnecessary strategic significance to the AIIB which is in
reality is first and foremost about development. It is about funding
more roads, railroads, airports, and pipelines for many developing
countries in Asia. If the U.S. becomes hypersensitive to China's every
effort in global governance, then it is possible that the U.S. might
reach the wrong conclusion that China indeed is trying to overthrow U.S.
hegemony and start taking countermeasures to curb China's rising
influence.]{.underline} That would be a tragedy. In actuality, China
cannot and will not challenge U.S. hegemony. Another thing that is worth
remembering, as many have already pointed out, is that [[the AIIB's
future is still uncertain]{.mark}.]{.underline} For one thing, [[it is
the first time that Beijing has tried running a multilateral economic
institution]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some internal challenges will not be
fixed easily, and some external challenges are even harder to overcome.
[[It is not clear how democratic and transparent the decision-making
structure will be within the AIIB]{.mark}, especially now that many
major economies like Germany and the U.K. have decided to
join]{.underline} the bank. What is more likely is that [Beijing's
preferences will be constrained by such major players]{.underline},
which is not necessarily a bad thing. The reason is that these more
experienced players can help Beijing make better decisions when
allocating funds and thus ultimately improve the quality and reputation
of the AIIB in the future. More importantly, a more democratic structure
in the AIIB will reduce the suspicions and worries of smaller Asian
countries that are already wary of China's future intentions. By
delegating more power to other players, Beijing can send a strong and
reassuring signal to countries like Vietnam and the Philippines thereby
moderating tensions between these countries, stemming from maritime
territorial disputes. [Beijing must make a serious effort to show that
the AIIB is not just another weapon to help China dominate Southeast
Asia.]{.underline} Failing to do so would jeopardize not only the AIIB's
goals but also China's project of a peaceful rise. Finally, **[[it is
misleading to claim that the U.S. is a loser in the
AIIB]{.underline}]{.mark}** project. While it was unwise for the U.S. to
prevent its allies from joining the AIIB earlier, it would be equally
unwise to underestimate the potential influence of the U.S. on the AIIB
and development in Asia in general. Whether or not the U.S. eventually
joins the AIIB remains to be seen. If the U.S. does join the AIIB, then
we could very well see a different structure for the bank. [[Even if the
U.S. chooses to stay outside of the AIIB in the future, competition
between AIIB and the U.S.-led world bank and]{.mark} International
Monetary Fund [(IMF) will ensure that American standards]{.mark} and
[will]{.mark} continue to [dominate]{.mark}]{.underline} the global

national security at home. While protectionists and free trade advocates
erupted into a fierce debate, the stock market tumbled. The Dow Jones

intervention happened at a critical moment for both industries." Three
years ago, Century Aluminum, a U.S.-based producer of aluminum, had to
curtail production by 60 percent at its Hawesville, Ky., smelter in
response to cheap aluminum imports. Given the dramatic fall of aluminum
prices, the company was eventually forced to lay off 300
workers,]{.underline} Jesse Gary, the company's executive vice president
and general counsel, told Bloomberg Law. [[Post-tariffs, Century has
plans for a production restart at the smelter. It's set to be fully

#### Plan: The United States federal government should impose a \$40 tax per cubic ton of greenhouse gas emissions on all commercial companies in the United States.

#### Carbon taxes solve 

[**Davenport 18** (]{.underline}Coral Davenport covers energy and
environmental policy, with a focus on climate change, from The Times\'s
Washington bureau. Davenport, C. (2018). Major climate report describes
a strong risk of crisis as early as 2040.)

INCHEON, South Korea --- A landmark report from the United Nations'
scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the
immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and
says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy
at a speed and scale that has "no documented historic precedent."

The report , issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations
to guide world leaders, describes a world of worsening food shortages
and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040
--- a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.

The report "is quite a shock, and quite concerning," said Bill Hare, an
author of previous I.P.C.C. reports and a physicist
with Climate Analytics, a nonprofit organization. "We were not
aware of this just a few years ago." The report was the first to be
commissioned by world leaders under the Paris agreement, the 2015 pact
by nations to fight global warming .

The authors found that [[if g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as
[emissions continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up
by]{.mark} as much as [2.7 degrees]{.mark} Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees
Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040]{.underline}, inundating
coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty. Previous work had
focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise
by a larger number, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), because
that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most
severe effects of climate change.

The new report, however, shows that [many of those effects will come
much sooner, at the 2.7-degree mark.]{.underline}

[[Avoiding the most serious damage requires transforming the world
economy]{.mark} within just a few years, said the authors, who estimate
that the damage would come at a cost of \$54 trillion. But while they
conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes
required to avoid 2.7 degrees of warming, they concede that it may be
politically unlikely.]{.underline}

\[How much hotter is your hometown today than when you were born? Find
out here. \]

For instance, the report says that [[heavy taxes or prices on carbon
dioxide emissions]{.mark} --- perhaps as high as \$27,000 per ton by
2100 --- [would be required]{.mark}.]{.underline} But such a move would
be almost politically impossible in the United States, the world's
largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China.
Lawmakers around the world, including in China, the European Union and
California, have enacted [carbon pricing programs.]{.underline}

[President Trump, who has mocked the
science of human-caused climate change, has vowed to increase the
burning of coal and said he intends to withdraw from the Paris
agreement]{.underline}. And on Sunday in Brazil, the world's
seventh-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, voters appeared on track to
elect a new president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has said he also plans to
withdraw from the accord.

The report was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries who
analyzed more than 6,000 scientific studies. The Paris agreement set out
to prevent warming of more than 3.6 degrees above preindustrial levels
--- long considered a threshold for the most severe social and economic
damage from climatechange. But the heads of small island nations,
fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the
effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.

\[What on Earth is going on? Sign up to get our latest stories
about climate change. \]

Absent aggressive action, many effects once expected only several
decades in the future will arrive by 2040, and at the lower temperature,
the report shows. "It's telling us we need to reverse emissions trends
and turn the world economy on a dime," said Myles Allen, an Oxford
University climate scientist and an author of the report.

[[To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming]{.mark}, the report said,
[greenhouse pollution must be reduced]{.mark} by 45 percent from 2010
levels by 2030, and 100 percent by 2050. It also found that, by 2050,
use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40
percent today to between 1 and 7 percent. Renewable energy such as wind
and solar, which make up about 20 percent of the electricity mix today,
would have to increase to as much as 67 percent.]{.underline}

"This report makes it clear: There is no way to mitigate climate change
without getting rid of coal," said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at
Duke University and an author of the report.

The World Coal Association disputed the conclusion that stopping global
warming calls for an end of coal use. In a statement, Katie Warrick, its
interim chief executive, noted that forecasts from the International
Energy Agency , a global analysis organization, "continue to see a role
for coal for the foreseeable future."

Ms. Warrick said her organization intends to campaign for governments to
invest in carbon capture technology. Such technology, which is currently
too expensive for commercial use, could allow coal to continue to be
widely used.

Despite the controversial policy implications, the United States
delegation joined more than 180 countries on Saturday in accepting
the report's summary for policymakers, while walking a delicate
diplomatic line. A State Department statement said that
"acceptance of this report by the panel does not imply endorsement by
the United States of the specific findings or underlying
contents of the report."

The State Department delegation faced a conundrum. Refusing to approve
the document would place the United States at odds with many nations and
show it rejecting established academic science on the world stage.
However, the delegation also represents a president who has
rejected climate science and climate policy.

"We reiterate that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris
agreement at the earliest opportunity absent the identification of terms
that are better for the American people," the statement said.

The report attempts to put a price tag on the effects of climate change.
The estimated \$54 trillion in damage from 2.7 degrees of warming would
grow to \$69 trillion if the world continues to warm by 3.6 degrees and
beyond, the report found, although it does not specify the
length of time represented by those costs.

The report concludes that the world is already more than halfway to the
2.7-degree mark. Human activities have caused warming of about 1.8
degrees since about the 1850s, the beginning of large-scale industrial
coal burning, the report found.

The United States is not alone in failing to reduce emissions enough to
prevent the worst effects of climate change. The report concluded that
the greenhouse gas reduction pledges put forth under the Paris agreement
will not be enough to avoid 3.6 degrees of warming.

The report emphasizes the potential role of a tax on carbon dioxide
emissions. "A [price on carbon is central to prompt mitigation,"
the report concludes. It estimates that to be effective, [such a price
would have to range from \$135 to \$5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide
pollution]{.mark} in 2030, and from \$690 to \$27,000 per ton by
2100.]{.underline}

By comparison, under the Obama administration, government economists
estimated that an appropriate price on carbon would be in the
range of \$50 per ton. Under the Trump administration, that figure was
lowered to about \$7 per ton .

Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group funded by the
libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, has
made a point of campaigning against politicians who support a carbon
tax.

"[[Carbon taxes are political poison because they increase gas
prices]{.mark} and electric rates]{.underline}," said Myron Ebell, who
heads the energy program at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an
industry-funded Washington research organization, and who led the Trump
administration's transition at the Environmental Protection Agency.

The report details the economic damage expected should governments fail
to enact policies to reduce emissions. [[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, it said, [could lose roughly 1.2
percent of g]{.mark}ross [d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct [for every
1.8 degrees of warming]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In addition, it said, the United States along with Bangladesh, China,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam are home to
50 million people who will be exposed to the effects of increased
coastal flooding by 2040, if 2.7 degrees of warming occur.

At 3.6 degrees of warming, the report predicts a "disproportionately
rapid evacuation" of people from the tropics. "In some parts of the
world, national borders will become irrelevant," said Aromar Revi,
director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an
author of the report. "You can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000
and 20,000 and one million people, but not 10 million."

The report also finds that, in the likelihood that governments fail to
avert 2.7 degrees of warming, another scenario is possible: The world
could overshoot that target, heat up by more than 3.6 degrees, and then
through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture
technology, bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree
threshold.

In that scenario, some damage would be irreversible, the report found.
All coral reefs would die. However, the sea ice that would disappear in
the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off.

"For governments, the idea of overshooting the target but then coming
back to it is attractive because then they don't have to make such rapid
changes," Dr. Shindell said. "But it has a lot of disadvantages."

[[[Carbon
tax](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/carbon-tax)
is]{.mark} a [useful and prospective policy measure to mitigate]{.mark}
China's [[carbon
emissions]{.mark}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/carbon-dioxide-emission)]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
In order to examine its effect on China's industrial economy and
CO2emissions, as well as identifying regional disparity, a novel CGE
model covering 30 Chinese provinces was developed to evaluate the carbon
tax effect on 30 provinces. The main conclusions and suggestions for
China's carbon tax implementation include:

First, [[carbon tax can effectively reduce industrial carbon
emissions]{.mark} after 2020 [with]{.mark} the [increasing carbon price.
The industrial CO2 will be reduced from 12.2 billion tons]{.mark} under
BaU scenario [to]{.mark} 10.4 billion tons, 9.3 billion tons, 8.5
billion tons, 7.9 billion tons, 7.4 billion tons and [7.0 billion
tons]{.mark} in 2030 under scenarios of TAX20, TAX40, TAX60, TAX80,
TAX100 and TAX120, respectively]{.underline}. Moreover, sectors of
Electricity, Metal
[smelting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/smelting)
and Chemicals are the three main sectors for CO2 emission and reduction,
and should be the key sectors for implementing carbon tax policy in
China.

Second, significant regional disparity of carbon tax effect on carbon
reduction exists. GDP is the top factor to affect regional CO2 emission,
[while [coal production]{.mark}/consumption and total energy consumption
[are the most important factors that affect CO2 reduction potential when
levying carbon tax]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, Inner Mongolia,
Shandong, Shanxi and Hebei are the top four provinces to reduce China's
industrial CO2 emissions, coal production/consumption and total energy
consumption.

Third, all provinces will suffer from GDP losses after levying carbon
tax. Developed eastern provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Guangdong and
Jiangsu will suffer from the largest absolute GDP losses, while less
developed western provinces such as Ningxia, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia,
Xinjiang and Gansu will bear the most welfare losses. Moreover, energy
structure will change significantly from coal to crude oil or natural
gas, particularly in Gansu, Sichuan, Qinghai, Jilin and Inner Mongolia.

Finally, carbon tax sensitivity and carbon tax efficiency are
investigated and discussed in order to provide appropriate carbon tax
policies. Research results indicate that provinces of Shanxi, Inner
Mongolia, Hebei and Anhui should be set top priority for implementing
carbon tax policy in China. However, [[carbon price should be set as
less than 50 USD/ton]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, in order to solve
the problem that higher carbon tax efficiency may lead to more GDP loss
and welfare loss, it is suggested that the [[revenue from carbon tax
should be reallocated]{.mark} and transferred more [to western regions
to balance their]{.mark} welfare [losses]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Carbon taxes work -- produce revenue and reduce gases

On balance an upstream [[CT on fossil fuel s]{.mark}ales [seems]{.mark}
likely [to be a]{.mark}n administratively [better option than a
downstream CT]{.mark} imposed directly on power and industrial plant
emissions, providing a better balance of coverage/accuracy and
administrative practicality]{.underline}; and it [has no conclusive
non-administrative disadvantages]{.underline}. But countries have in
practice managed to administer downstream CT on power and industrial
plant emissions, and if combined with CT on retail sales of fuel for
transport and domestic consumption, this could achieve quite high
coverage, even though not as high as an upstream CT. If CT is imposed
upstream on fossil fuels there does not have to be a single point of
taxation. The experience of collecting excise taxes is likely to be
useful for working out the most practical points of measurement to
ensure that they are comprehensively taxed in practice. If petroleum
excise tax is applied to refinery output, and coal excise to mine
output, these might be best points of measurement for CT purposes too.
This chapter cannot claim to have identified and addressed every
practical problem that might arise with an upstream CT. But in general
it seems likely that such problems will be similar in kind and degree to
those that arise with excise taxes, and should therefore be capable of
being addressed in practice. British Columbia probably comes closest to
an upstream CT, and seems to combine reasonable coverage (estimated at
77 percent of Canada's total GHG emissions 8 ) with relatively simple
administration. Sequestered CO 2 from fossil fuels Non-energy use of
fossil fuels Non-energy use produced 1.8 percent of GHG emissions in
2010, but if CT applied upstream, it would be necessary to ensure that
it applied only to CO 2 emitted and not to CO 2 stored, for example, in
asphalt (where 100 percent is stored), chemical feedstock (62), waxes
(58), lubricants (9), others (25). If CT applied to refinery output it
would be possible to identify and exempt asphalt at that stage, and
similarly to identify and exempt (or partially exempt) other products
destined for non-combustion use. If not possible, then purchasers would
have to apply for refunds (as currently happens with excise where
petroleum fuels are used for exempt purposes such as agriculture).
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) CCS is not an immediate concern since
there has been limited development of CCS technology in practice so far.
9 If it did become viable in future, steps would have to be taken to
exempt captured CO 2 from CT. If CT applied upstream, it would not be
practical to identify and exempt in advance fuels whose CO 2 would be
captured by CSS. Retrospective linking of CCS to the relevant upstream
supply, refund of CT on that supply, and revision of the price charged
to the customer for it would be administratively complex, and if CCS
ever became common, with CO 2 piped from numerous sources to CCS plants,
it would probably negate some of the administrative advantage of
upstream CT. The problem with CT credits or refunds in an upstream
system is that upstream CT payers might not be involved in CCS projects,
and downstream businesses who were involved would be unable to use them.
One option would be to make CT credits tradable, but this would add
complexity and might be open to fraud. A simpler option would be for the
government just to pay an amount equal to CT per ton to a company that
implemented CSS. 10 The government would monitor CCS facilities, and
charge CT on any CO 2 that escaped. Monitoring CCS would be a specialist
technical function, and monitoring and payment could be allocated to a
specialist technical agency either in the IRS or outside it.
International issues might have to be considered in due course -- for
example, import or export of liquefied CO 2 for CCS. Credit for export
would need international cooperation (to ensure CO 2 was genuinely
stored). The US would give no credit for imported CO 2, but would impose
CT on any that escaped. Land use (forestry, etc.) carbon sinks Forestry
provides the main potential carbon "sink" (though of course
deforestation can increase GHG emissions). In 2010, forestry and other
land use were estimated by 52 Jack Calder the EPA to have reduced US CO
2 emissions by a substantial 1,075 MMT, primarily through increases in
forest density or acreage. In principle there is a case for the
government to provide some form of CT set-off for additional CO 2 sunk
in forestry. As with CCS, it would probably be better for the government
not to try and embed forestry within the CT regime through CT refunds,
tradable CT credits, and the like, but instead simply to make payments
equivalent to the rate of CT per ton direct to forestry businesses that
could provide an acceptable measure of additional tons of CO 2 sunk,
since this would be easier to administer and less open to fraud. The
basic problem, however, would be how to establish additionality. It has
been suggested that if potential qualifying companies were limited to
large paper and forest product companies, who were required to measure
sunk CO 2 by reference to their entire land stock, it might make
additionality easier to establish. But there would be a host of other
complex technical issues in measuring CO 2 sunk in forestry, even if
additionality could be established. These issues are far too complex to
do justice to in this short chapter. Measurement, if it did become
feasible, would be a highly technical operation, and, as for CCS,
administration would probably have to be carried out by a specialist
technical agency either within the IRS or entirely separate from it
(since the required expertise might already exist in other government
departments). 11 Extending CT to non-fossil fuel emissions With
non-fossil fuel emissions it is again normally possible to identify
different stages at which a CT could theoretically be imposed, but it is
generally harder to identify anything equivalent to an upstream taxing
point; and a large proportion of these emissions are fugitive, not
measured for normal business purposes, and in some cases very difficult
to measure at all in relation to individual taxpayers. This means that
administration is likely to be more complex, and coverage in some cases
may be impractical. A factor to take into account is the [relative cost
or difficulty of reducing the emissions. [If the]{.mark} prime [purpose
of a CT is seen as reducing emissions,]{.mark} it may be felt that if
[CT would result in a]{.mark} relatively [large reduction in GHG]{.mark}
(particularly those with high GWPs), [it]{.mark} may be [worth the
administrative effort]{.mark} even if the emission is relatively small;
and conversely that there is little point in applying CT to a
substantial but hard-to-administer emission if no one can reduce it
anyway. (An alternative point of view is that [governments should apply
CT to]{.mark} significant [emissions even if they are difficult to
reduce, primarily as]{.mark} a [means of raising
revenue.)]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### They work - China

[**Dong,** Wei, Ma, and Li **17** (]{.underline}Baomin Dong, Weixian
Wei, Xili Ma & Peng Li (2018) On the impacts of carbon tax and
technological progress on China,Applied
Economics, 50:4, 389-406, DOI: [10.1080/00036846.2017.1316826](https://doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2017.1316826))

Climate change has become one of the primary threats to mankind.
[[Mitigating climate change will require]{.mark} substantial abatement
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all core economic
sectors]{.underline} (Pacala and Socolow 2004). [Control for local air
pollutants]{.underline} and elevation of overall air pollution control
standard [will]{.underline} also [result in [considerable reductions
of]{.mark} carbon dioxide ([CO2]{.mark}) emissions]{.underline},
especially in developing countries, such as China. In 2015, global CO2
emissions reached 32.1 billion metric tons, roughly equivalent to the
2014 level.1 The emission of CO2 has gone beyond the earth's absorption
capacity. As Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii reports that by February
2016, the atmospheric CO2 concentration was 403 PPM, exceeding 400 PPM
for the first time in history.2 In the same time, Chinese CO2 emission
is 8.98 billion metric tons, contributing about 30% to the world,
according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The proportion of
Chinese CO2 emission in the world has increased from 5.94% in 1971 to
27.89% in 2013. [Too much CO2 emissions will eventually result in
unwanted climate change -- higher global temperatures, greater climate
variability and possibly increases in sea levels. This [external
cost,]{.mark} referred to as the social cost of carbon (SCC), [ranges
from \$10 to \$200 per ton CO2]{.mark} according to various
estimations]{.underline} (Pindyck 2013). In other words, [CO2 abatement
will generate enormous benefits, which is equivalent to the SCC of CO2
emissions]{.underline}. As for China, [carbon reduction could bring some
benefits, including (a) reducing extreme cold or warm weather events;
(b) decelerating or even preventing land degradation and
desertification; (c) ameliorating glacial melt on the Qinghai--Tibetan
Plateau; and (d) alleviating sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion
according to Asian Development Bank (ADB 2010).]{.underline}
Unquestionably, a large amount of direct or indirect costs is required
for varied carbon-cutting measures. Substantial investment is an
essential prerequisite of technological innovation, such as shifting
carbon energy to clean energy, enhancing energy efficiency in both
consumption and production sides. In other ways, economic measures (e.g.
[carbon tax]{.underline} and/or carbon emission right trading) may
cripple macroeconomic development. [The [abatement cost is estimated as
10 \~ 30 dollars in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates (Burtraw et al.
2014) and 300 \~ 1500 RMB in China (Du and Mao 2015) [for cutting each
ton of CO2]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the largest contributor of CO2
emissions in the world, China has made a great effort to mitigate its
rising trend of GHG emissions. In 2007, the Chinese central government
launched an energy-conservation and pollution-abatement programme which
aimed to shift China towards a low-carbon society (Council 2007). The
Chinese government has announced its national voluntary target of carbon
abatement, that is, [to reduce the CO2 emission per unit of GDP by
60--65% from 2005 level by 2030]{.underline} (Council 2015). China's
carbon abatement will be especially challenging, since her economy is
more dependent on energy-intensive manufacturing industries and the
primary energy source is coal. Most of the CO2 emissions are related to
fossil energy consumption, such as coal, oil and gas (Saidi and Hammami
2015). Based on the energy performance standards (EPS) database from
IEA, energy-related CO2 emission explains more than 93% of the total
emission.3 Tradable emission permits and carbon tax (or emission tax in
general) are the two main market approaches in curbing carbon dioxide
emissions. The theoretical literature has shown the merits of the tax
scheme over the quantity scheme, notably from Weitzman (1974) onward. In
particular, the incentive provided by the grandfathered permits for
firms to invest in abatement technologies is smaller than a constant
emission tax, since the marginal abatement costs (MACs) decrease as
firms invest, thus reducing the market price of the permits and
consequently the benefits of the investment (Milliman and Prince, 1989;
Jung et al., 1996). Moreover, the permit price is more volatile (due to
economy-wide uncertainties) relative to tax rate, which further reducing
the irreversible abatement investment (Chao and Wilson, 1993).
Furthermore, the overwhelmingly high monitoring cost for the enforcement
of emission trading scheme makes it more costly to implement. Currently,
the Shenzhen emission exchange, established on 30 September 2010, as the
first and only CO2 emission exchange in China, has an accumulated
trading volume which has just reached two million tons by 2014.4 The
amount is so less compared to the total emissions of the country, some
seven billion tons per year. [In the past, [China levied a resource tax
on coal]{.mark} among other mineral and fossil resources. The effect of
resource tax differs from that of carbon tax in that the latter applies
to all domestic production with carbon emission where the former is
concerned with all fossil energy production excluding importation, [thus
the downstream firms' abatement investment incentives
differ]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 For research on resource tax in China, the
existing studies mainly focused on the impacts of such tax policy on
China's economy rather than worldwide impacts (Shi, Tang, and Yu 2015;
Xu et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2013). Xu et al. (2015) find that [if China
adopts a 5% ad valorem resources tax on coal, her [CO2 emission will
decrease by 8--9%, and GDP will decrease by
1--2%]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Due to the preference of
emission/carbon tax over tradable emission permits, the literature has
been explosive on carbon tax.6The computable general equilibrium (CGE)
models have gained popularity in this line of research for simulations
and policy analyses (Zhou et al. 2011). The research questions in these
studies differ. One strand of the CGE models simulates the implied
carbon tax rate with different mitigation targets (Garbaccio, Ho, and
Jorgenson 1999; Liang, Fan, and Wei 2007; Stram 2014; Zhang 1998).
Another strand investigates the mitigation outcome and nationwide
economic impacts of different carbon taxes (Barker, Baylis, and Madsen
1993; Goto 1995; Grimaud and Rouge 2014; Rausch 2013), as well as the
impacts on individual sectors (Liu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015). The
current article also considers the impact of [abatement technology
improvement assuming it is exogenous]{.underline}. The [improvement of
abatement technologies is the source of the gross welfare gains of a
particular emission scheme such as carbon tax or tradable
permits]{.underline}. Although attempts have been made to endogenize the
technology improvement (Webster et al., 2008; Buonanno et al., 2003;
Mulder et al., 2003), the literature has not found a convincing method
to incorporate it in CGE models due to data constraint even with the
most comprehensive data set such as GTAP-E model (McDougall and Golub
2007) and the inherent complexity of all CGE models. Thus, the received
literature has confined itself to econometric studies or scenario
analyses to investigate the potentials of energy saving for a given
sector (Zhang, Worrell, and CrijnsGraus 2015; Jiang et al., 2015; Ke et
al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014; Ates, 2015; Kusumadewi and Limmeechokchai,
2015; Sritong et al., 2014; Moutinho et al., 2015).

### 2NC -- Carbon Tax -- Solvency

#### Solves for GHG emissions -- Polluters Pay Principle

**[Baranzini et al 17]{.underline}** (Baranzini, A., van den Bergh, J.
C., Carattini, S., Howarth, R. B., Padilla, E. and Roca, J. (2017),

instruments, and political economy considerations. WIREs Clim Change, 8:
e462. doi:[10.1002/wcc.462](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.462))

[[Carbon pricing]{.mark} affects emissions by [penaliz]{.mark}ing
[energy sources in proportion to their carbon
content]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is easily applicable to emissions
coming from energy use, but can be extended to emissions arising from
land use changes and other sources. In what follows we present the most
important arguments in favor of carbon pricing.

[Argument 1: [As Carbon Pricing Alters Relative Prices, Firms and
Consumers Automatically Internalize Global Warming
Effects]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Carbon pricing changes]{.mark} relative [prices of all
goods]{.mark}]{.underline} and services [[in accordance with the
P]{.mark}olluter [P]{.mark}ays [P]{.mark}rinciple]{.underline}. As a
consequence, [[when making decisions that cause GHG emissions, firms,
consumers,]{.mark} and investors [consider not just their]{.mark}
private [costs and benefits, but also the social costs associated
with]{.mark} (direct and indirect) [emissions generated in every phase
of the product life cycle]{.mark}, from resource to waste. **[The entire
economy]{.mark} then [becomes less carbon intensive]{.mark}**, since all
consumers and producers will adjust their decisions to prices corrected
for the climate externality]{.underline}. To obtain the same result with
nonprice instruments would require that the regulator possesses all
relevant information about emissions and abatement options to control in
detail all polluting processes and behaviors. This would evidently be
extremely difficult and imply a huge cost of governance.

[Carbon pricing means that the prices of fossil energy fuels will
adequately reflect the carbon content of these fuels]{.underline}. As a
result, [[industries that use more carbon]{.mark}‐intense fuels [will
face higher input costs and thus ask higher output prices from their
customers]{.mark}.]{.underline} In turn, [[sectors using these outputs
as inputs will also see their output prices go up]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Finally, [[consumers buying products]{.mark} or services [from the
latter sectors will confront higher prices as well]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As all these agents are motivated to purchase the cheaper input, product
or service, a shift will occur to options with relatively low direct and
indirect emissions. In other words, [[with a fairly simple
carbon‐pricing policy]{.mark} on fossil fuels [each price in the
econ]{.mark}omy [will be corrected so as to reflect in some way the
overall CO2 emissions]{.mark} effect of the associated good or
service]{.underline}. This means that [[**no** **economic** **decision**
**escapes** the regulatory effect of carbon pricing---**it is a systemic
solution**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This does not mean carbon pricing is
the complete and only solution: as discussed in the More Than Carbon
Pricing section, complementary instruments are needed, because of
informational failures and bounded rationality, among others.

#### **Only carbon pricing solves -- heterogeneity of emitters is an obstacle the aff can't overcome**

**[Baranzini et al 17]{.underline}** (Baranzini, A., van den Bergh, J.
C., Carattini, S., Howarth, R. B., Padilla, E. and Roca, J. (2017),

instruments, and political economy considerations. WIREs Clim Change, 8:
e462. doi:[10.1002/wcc.462](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.462))

[Argument 2: Carbon Pricing Accounts for Heterogeneity of Emitters,
Which Reduces the Overall Abatement Cost]{.underline}

Compared to other types of instruments, [[carbon pricing]{.mark} can
[address the vast heterogeneity of GHG emitters]{.mark}]{.underline},
thus [[helping to minimize the cost of pollution
control]{.underline}]{.mark}. Heterogeneity might result from firms
producing diverse goods or having distinct technologies, and thus
different emissions per unit of output, which translates into unequal
marginal costs of pollution abatement. [Under perfect information and
substantive rationality, all polluters should choose that level of
emissions abatement for which the associated marginal cost equals the
carbon price]{.underline}. Hence, [[with a carbon price signal, the
marginal abatement costs would become equal among all polluters]{.mark},
implying that a given level of abatement is met at least global cost. No
other instrument than pricing is able to realize the same
outcome]{.underline}. Since polluters show inertia or are not always
perfectly aware of available abatement technologies and associated
costs, one should expect the global cost to not reach the exact lowest
level. [Nevertheless, [empirical research suggests that reliance on
nonprice policy instruments]{.mark} often [leads to considerably higher
abatement
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}.[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0005),
[6](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0006)
The reason is that such instruments are less effective in covering
diverse sources of emissions. For example, [it [is impossible to
implement technical standards for the millions of technologies and
products worldwide, and moreover update these frequently to account
for]{.mark} nonstop technical [innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline} To
illustrate, two studies show, using different models, that a fuel
economy standard for cars results in considerably higher costs of
reducing CO2 emissions than fuel
taxes.[7](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0007),
[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0008)
Note that older empirical studies found the abatement costs of uniform
standards to be up to a factor 22 higher than those of pricing
instruments.[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0009)

#### Carbon taxes are key -- they spur innovation to clean tech which is something the aff can't do

[Argument 3: Carbon Pricing Provides a Continuous Incentive for Adoption
and Innovation of Carbon‐Efficient Technologies]{.underline}

[[Carbon pricing]{.mark} contributes to so‐called dynamic efficiency as
it [stimulates innovation and adoption of tech]{.mark}nologie[s]{.mark}
[emitting less carbon]{.mark}]{.underline}. By increasing the cost of
carbon‐emitting technologies and activities, [carbon pricing [provides a
financial incentive for]{.mark} consumers and [producers to invest in
tech]{.mark}nologies [reducing emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This not
only [encourages more adoption of existing low‐carbon technologies, but
[also indirectly promotes the development of new
ones]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Empirical evidence suggests a positive
relationship between higher energy prices and the development of more
energy‐efficient
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}[nologies]{.underline}.[10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0010)
Compared with emission or technology‐based standards, carbon pricing
provides a continuous and stronger economic incentive for adoption of,
and R&D on, improved abatement technologies. Econometric studies find
that under stable energy prices, innovations generally reduce consumer
prices, [while [after oil price hikes, they tend to make equipment more
energy
efficient]{.mark}]{.underline}.[11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0011)
This suggests that [[carbon pricing is an essential element of a policy
package aimed at redirecting technical change towards the cleaner
goods]{.mark} and ways of production]{.underline}. Further support for
this comes from a comprehensive theoretical
analysis.[12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0012)

Examining the effect of the European carbon market (EU‐ETS) on
innovation, one study finds that [[carbon pricing is responsible for a
10% increase in clean innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} (measured by
patents), [[in spite of]{.mark} the relatively [low prices
experienced]{.mark} so
far]{.underline}.[13](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0013)
Another study provides additional evidence on the innovation effects of
EU‐ETS.[14](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0014)
Both confirm the results of an earlier patent‐based study that [[energy
prices have the largest inducement effect on energy‐related
innovations]{.underline}]{.mark}.[15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0015)
A third study analyses 3412 firm‐level patent data from 80 countries for
the car industry between 1965 and 2005, concluding that [firms tend to
innovate more in clean technologies when they face higher tax‐inclusive
fuel
prices.[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0016)]{.underline}

[[Corrected prices are essential to rapid innovation in the right
direction]{.underline}]{.mark}, as relative prices steer innovation
opportunities and associated investments. This aspect is
underappreciated in many discussions about technological change and
climate change, where pricing is downplayed as if innovation/diffusion
subsidies and other innovation policies, such as information provision
or stimulating cooperation between innovators, were sufficient. To fully
appreciate the subtlety of this point, it should be recognized that
rather than current carbon or energy prices, expectations about future
prices are
relevant.[17](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0017)
Of course, [[a high]{.mark} carbon [price today acts as a signal for the
near]{.mark} and more distant [future, so]{.mark} that [it will
contribute to stimulating investments]{.mark} and R&D [with]{.mark} the
[aim to reduce dependence on]{.mark} high [carbon]{.mark} energy in all
sectors of the economy.]{.underline}

#### **Carbon taxes avoid Jevon's paradox -- means aff can't solve otherwise due to carbon rebound**

**[Baranzini et al 17]{.underline}** (Baranzini, A., van den Bergh, J.
C., Carattini, S., Howarth, R. B., Padilla, E. and Roca, J. (2017),
Carbon pricing in climate policy: seven reasons, complementary
instruments, and political economy considerations. WIREs Clim Change, 8:
e462. doi:[10.1002/wcc.462](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.462))

[Argument 4: Carbon Pricing Represents the Most Effective Way to Limit
Energy/Carbon Rebound]{.underline}

[The issue of energy rebound and how carbon pricing could mitigate it
has received little attention in the public debate on carbon
pricing]{.underline}. One reason may be that this argument was neglected
by previous comprehensive reviews of environmental policy
analysis.[18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0018),
[19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0019)
In line with this, [rebound has so far not been considered a standard
criterion in environmental policy analysis.]{.underline}

[[Rebound denotes that energy conservation]{.mark}, including through
adoption of more energy‐efficient technologies, [can]{.mark} indirectly
[create additional energy uses and associated
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, the net [conservation effect will
be lower than the initial energy savings---or even negative in some
cases, [known as Jevons paradox]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rebound involves
diffusion of technologies as well as various economic mechanisms.
Technological advances and improvements in energy efficiency tend to
lead to a direct reduction in energy consumption. [However, given the
improved efficiency, the energy services---for instance, traveling by
car---become cheaper, which stimulates more intensive use of these
services]{.underline}. Moreover, money saved due to more energy
efficiency will increase spending on other goods and services, and hence
associated energy use and
emissions.[20](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0020)

Compared to other policy instruments, [[opportunities for such rebound
effect are limited if carbon pricing is in place]{.mark}, [because
it]{.mark} i[s a systems approach that reduces rebound consistently
across all carbon‐intensive goods and
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}.[21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0021)
Such pricing would discourage money savings due to energy conservation
to be spent on energy‐intensive goods and services, as the latter will
have a higher price due to carbon pricing. Empirical evidence suggests
that such 're‐spending rebound' is non‐negligible and deserves serious
attention in policy
design.[22](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0022)
Furthermore, in many cases, [[carbon pricing can reduce absolute
rebound]{.mark} due to the direct rebound or intensity effect, [because
it may]{.mark} partially [compensate the fall in the user]{.mark} (fuel)
[cost due to implementing more energy‐efficient technologies]{.mark} (as
in
transport[23](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0023)).]{.underline}
In these circumstances, the direct rebound effect on demand, in absolute
terms, will be lower than in a situation without carbon prices as then
initial demand is higher.

[[Carbon pricing]{.mark} will]{.underline} further [[ensure that
consumers]{.mark} automatically]{.underline}, without even realizing,
[[make a trade‐off between]{.mark} the [individual benefits]{.mark} of
new or higher energy consumption [due to rebound and related climate
change
damages]{.mark}]{.underline}.[24](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0024)
Indeed, [[carbon pricing will]{.mark} mainly [discourage rebound
associated with a price correction for environmental damage costs
exceeding]{.mark} direct individual [benefits]{.mark} of the respective
consumption decision.]{.underline}

#### **Avoids politicization -- companies get to do their own thing AND faster timeframe -- firms don't have the bureaucracy the government does**

**[Baranzini et al 17]{.underline}** (Baranzini, A., van den Bergh, J.

instruments, and political economy considerations. WIREs Clim Change, 8:
e462. doi:[10.1002/wcc.462](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.462))

[Argument 6: Carbon Pricing Decentralizes Policy, Reducing Regulators'
Need for Information]{.underline}

[[Carbon pricing is consistent with flex]{.mark}ibility [and autonomy of
choice, allowing emitters to freely change their behavior to reduce
their costs]{.mark}.]{.underline} They can opt for emitting and paying
any charges or taxes associated with emissions, or for undertaking a
variety of activities, immediately or after relevant investments, to
abate emissions. [[Carbon pricing]{.mark} thus [means decentralization
of policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, with associated low information needs
and administrative costs. In addition, [carbon pricing [implies low
transactions costs for firms]{.mark}]{.underline}, as, unlike
eco‐labeling, it [[requires no separate life cycle analysis to account
for all c]{.mark}arb[o]{.mark}n dioxide [emissions of products]{.mark}
and services]{.underline}. Instead, [[firms will integrate carbon prices
in existing cost‐accounting systems of their products and
services.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### **Carbon pricing reaches out to consumers and ensures micropolitical change**

**[Baranzini et al 17]{.underline}** (Baranzini, A., van den Bergh, J.
C., Carattini, S., Howarth, R. B., Padilla, E. and Roca, J. (2017),

instruments, and political economy considerations. WIREs Clim Change, 8:
e462. doi:[10.1002/wcc.462](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.462))

[Argument 7: Carbon Pricing Takes into Account that in Making Purchasing
Decisions, most Consumers are more Influenced by Prices than by
Environmental Concerns]{.underline}

Even if one is environmentally conscious, it is impossible to perfectly
know which goods to buy and in what amounts to achieve environmental
goals. It is, moreover, unthinkable that one can voluntarily contribute
to all public goods in the
world.[39](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0039)
[Even though many people would like to contribute at a personal cost to
a more responsible use of the natural environment, such cooperative
behavior frequently depends on the perception of what others will
do]{.underline}.[40](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0040)
The fact that an individual action alone has a negligible impact tends
to discourage most people to undertake these voluntary actions.
Moreover, many consumers are not particularly environmentally conscious
in their purchase behavior, being sensitive to personally salient
concerns, notably financial considerations, when making purchasing
decisions. [[An effective climate policy has to reach out to this group.
Carbon pricing is]{.mark} capable of [doing this as it naturally
intervenes in a core element of markets]{.mark}, namely prices of goods
and services. [It does so without the need for people to act
altruistically]{.mark}, show voluntary environmentally benign behavior,
or have the ability to handle much information about products as in the
form of eco‐labels.]{.underline} This does not deny proenvironmental
behavior.[41](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0041),
[42](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0042)There
is no clear evidence, though, that voluntary action can overcome very
large differences in prices between green and dirty products/services,
nor that it applies to a large group of consumers. Of course,
policymakers are encouraged to leverage cooperative behavior when they
have the opportunity to do so, but this approach cannot represent the
main solution to climate change. [Probably the most relevant voluntary
behavior is that [voters choose politicians who will strike a climate
agreement that supports effective climate policies in all
countries]{.mark} (see PE Issue 4 in the section on Political Economy
Issues]{.underline}). Once implemented, [[carbon pricing does not
require proenvironmental behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nevertheless,
the evidence available so far suggests that, [[if anything,
proenvironmental behavior makes carbon pricing more effective,]{.mark}
which is all good for climate policy]{.underline} (PE Issue 5 in section
on Political Economy Issues).

### 2NC AT: Links to Politics

#### The cp is bipartisan and avoids politics

**[Colman and Wolff 18]{.underline}** (Zack Colman is an energy reporter
for POLITICO Pro. Eric Wolff covers energy policy and politics. Prior to
joining POLITICO in 2015, he covered the EPA for SNL Energy, an electric
power trade publication. 12-9-2018, \"Why greens are turning away from a
carbon tax,\" POLITICO,
https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/09/carbon-tax-climate-change-environmentalists-1052210)

[[Taxing carbon to tackle climate change]{.mark} is one of those big
ideas that have long [held a]{.mark} kind of [bipartisan sway]{.mark} in
Washington]{.underline} --- endorsed by Al Gore and former members of
Ronald Reagan's Cabinet, economists from both parties and even Exxon
Mobil.

But environmentalists are increasingly ready to look elsewhere.

This month\'s fuel-tax riots in Paris and the defeat of a carbon-fee
ballot measure in Washington state show the difficulty of getting people
to support a levy on the energy sources that heat their homes and power
their cars. Meanwhile, even the most liberal Democratic candidates this
year gave carbon taxes scant if any mention in their climate platforms,
focusing instead on proposals like a phaseout of fossil fuels and
massive investments in wind and solar power.

The story of the carbon tax's fading appeal, even among groups that like
it in principle, shows the difficulties of crafting a politically
palatable solution to one of the world's most urgent problems ---
including greenhouse gas levels that are on track to [reach a record
high](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/12/05/we-are-trouble-global-carbon-emissions-reached-new-record-high/?utm_term=.1ea5b1d484c7)
this year.

"[This aversion to taxes in the U.S. is high and should not be
underestimated]{.underline}," said Kalee Kreider, a former Gore adviser
and longtime climate activist. "I have a lot of scars to show for that."

"I fear that the idea of a carbon tax is turning out to be a heavier
lift than people envision,\" said RL Miller, founder of the advocacy
group Climate Hawks Vote. \"As it is right now, starting from scratch,
there is no constituency for it. \... And I think the climate movement
needs to go through some rethinking.\"

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) pointed to the fate of Washington state\'s
proposed carbon fee, which \"failed miserably\" at the polls last month
despite the support of Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee.

\"If it can\'t pass in Washington state right now, I\'m not sure that
says that there\'s much of a pathway at this moment nationally,\"
Merkley said.

Even some progressives who support a carbon tax, such as Rep.-elect
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), are promoting it as just one possible
element of a sweeping \"[Green New Deal](https://ocasio2018.com/gnd)\"
that includes pouring huge amounts of money into renewable energy.

"There's been a [predominant conversation]{.underline} in Washington,
D.C., that's been led by economists and politicos that have tried to
[frame]{.underline} a [carbon tax as the only way]{.underline}," said
Evan Weber, national political director with the Sunrise Movement, which
has backed Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal. "It's proved time and time
again to be not politically popular, and we haven't even priced the
policy at where economists say it needs to be. The idea that \[a carbon
tax is\] the way out of this mess is something we need to be pushing
back on."

[[A carbon tax]{.mark}, imposed on each ton of greenhouse gases produced
by fuels like oil and coal, [is meant to make businesses]{.mark} and
consumers [pay a price for their role in worsening climate
change]{.mark} --- and offer an economic incentive for switching to
cleaner energy sources. That simplicity has won the endorsement of even
some [conservative
economists](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/a-conservative-case-for-climate-action.html),
as well as major corporations such as Exxon Mobil.]{.underline}

["[We need to put a price on carbon in markets, and we need to put a
price on denial in politics]{.mark},"]{.underline} Gore
[said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC01J0_Lde0) in 2015, adding that
"we are already paying an enormous cost in the form of floods, droughts,
famines."

Still, new taxes are toxic enough in Washington that former President
Barack Obama never endorsed the idea. Instead, he backed unsuccessful
legislation that would have created a more complicated cap-and-trade
system to put a price on carbon.

The notion has proved an equally tough sell elsewhere around the world:
Only [11
countries](https://priceoncarbon.org/pricing-mechanisms/cap-trade-2/)
have carbon taxes in place, and most of those were instituted more than
a decade ago. Australia canceled its carbon tax in 2014 after three
years, and Canada is in the process of imposing a carbon fee on some
reluctant provinces.

Carbon tax supporters, such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,
have typically sought to make their proposals more politically palatable
by returning much of the money to citizens to offset the higher energy
prices. Gore has [proposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MPWVJhD5Vo)
repaying the money to Americans "dollar to dollar" by eliminating
payroll taxes.

[Some plans would direct the money to investments in clean energy
investments,]{.underline} or --- in the case of Washington state\'s
proposal --- [toward helping communities suffering from the effects of
climate change or the closure of fossil fuel industries.]{.underline}
Others, such as a
[plan](https://www.clcouncil.org/media/The-Dividend-Advantage.pdf)
backed by former Republican Secretaries of State [George
Shultz](https://www.clcouncil.org/media/Wired_SH_Oct12.pdf) and [James
Baker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRX-nIsKFFA), would also phase
out existing carbon regulations.

But the Washington state proposal won the support of just 43 percent of
voters last month, after a barrage of oil and gas industry lobbying
opposing the carbon fee. The reaction was violent in Paris, where days
of riots forced French President Emmanuel Macron to scrap a 6.5-cent
fuel tax that had been aimed partly at weaning motorists off diesel and
gasoline.

The Washington state fee, whose supporters
[included](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-im-washington-states-carbon-fee-bill-gates)
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, would have charged a relatively modest
\$15 per ton of greenhouses gases. In contrast, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations\' climate [panel has called for charging \$135 per ton,
and increasing the fee to \$5,500 a ton by 2030]{.mark}, to keep the
rise in global temperatures from reaching catastrophic
levels.]{.underline}

\"You do have this irony, and that is [[the policy that is
overwhelmingly endorsed by economists of the right, the center and the
left as the best way to reduce g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as
emissions is inverse with what is politically feasible]{.underline},\"
said Barry Rabe, a University of Michigan professor who has studied
carbon taxes.

The failure to pass a carbon tax in Washington state stands in contrast
to California voters\' backing last month of an increase in the gasoline
tax, revenues from which are directed to improving the state\'s clogged
transportation infrastructure. California is one of more than two dozen
states that have increased their gasoline taxes in the past five years
to pay for road and bridge projects.

\"People are sensitive to taxes, but they will approve them if they\'re
perceived to be getting value, whether that be a road, a hospital, a
school,\" said Kreider, the former Gore adviser. \"Where I think
environmental groups struggle is they approach carbon pricing in terms
of environmental performance, instead of what service are they providing
to the taxpayer?\"

Green groups say there\'s still a place for a carbon tax in a broader
climate change policy. But Ocasio-Cortez, one of the top progressives in
next year\'s House freshman class, has said the climate crisis is far
too urgent for a tax to be the main strategy.

\"It\'s certainly possible to argue that, if we had put in place
targeted regulations and progressively increasing carbon and similar
taxes several decades ago, the economy could have transformed itself by
now,\" she said on her [campaign website](https://ocasio2018.com/gnd).
\"But whether or not that is true, we did not do that, and now time has
run out.\"

\"Probably a price is not going to be enough,\" said Ana Unruh Cohen,
managing director for government affairs for the Natural Resources
Defense Council. \"We need a larger, comprehensive approach.\"

The [[wave of Dem]{.mark}ocratic [governors and lawmakers
elected]{.mark} in November seems to [have picked up on this
current]{.mark}]{.underline}. Aside from Washington state\'s ballot
item, carbon taxes were mostly absent from campaign platforms despite
candidates\' emphasis on fighting climate change.

Others aren\'t ready to give up just yet, saying a revenue-neutral
carbon tax is the most sweeping greenhouse gas-reduction policy that
both parties could support. [[Reps]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ted Deutch
(D-Fla.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) [[unveiled a
bill]{.underline}]{.mark} on Nov. 27 [[to create]{.mark} such [a
tax]{.mark}]{.underline}. That was just months after Rep. Carlos Curbelo
(R-Fla.) launched a plan that would have taxed emissions and used the
revenue for highway projects and other programs, before he lost in the
November elections.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who has sponsored his own carbon tax
legislation, said two main [strategies have emerged to limit climate
change]{.underline}: regulating stricter greenhouse gases or [putting a
price on carbon]{.underline}. He doesn\'t see another path.

\"There\'s the third category, which is \'something else,\'\" Whitehouse
told POLITICO. \"And until somebody shows me what something else is, I
don\'t want to hear about something else.\"

Carbon tax backers say the approach has proved successful in places such
as British Columbia, Ireland and Norway. And other strategies to price
carbon have gotten footholds, such as the cap-and-trade program found in
nine Eastern states.

Others say a carbon tax could easily become part of the Green New Deal
or other broad-based plans as they are fleshed out.

\"When you talk about the Green New Deal and 100 percent clean economy,
I see those as values frameworks, and they don\'t have policy
prescriptions on how to get there,\" said Alison Cassady, managing
director for energy and environment at the liberal Center for American
Progress. \"In order to achieve a 100 percent clean economy, you\'re
going to need a lot of tools. A carbon tax could get you there part of
the way.\"

Some supporters say the biggest problem for carbon tax proposals has
been how they were designed --- and defeats in places like Washington
state are not a rejection of the overall concept.

\"I don\'t think we lost on the merits,\" Michael Brune, executive
director of the Sierra Club, which campaigned for the Washington ballot
initiative. \"I think we lost on the inability to transmit the message.
I do think that, yes at some point, perhaps it might make sense to take
the revenue generated from a carbon fee broadly defined and use it for
other purposes.\"

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- Carbon Tax

#### Carbon Taxes fail -- no behavioral change 

**[Motor News Reporter 19]{.underline}** (Motor News, 07-25-2019,
\"Carbon tax must bring real change in behaviour related to climate
change,\" BusinessLIVE,
https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/life/motoring/2019-07-25-carbon-tax-must-bring-real-change-in-behaviour-related-to-climate-change/)

The [Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse ([Outa]{.mark})]{.underline} has
[[urged the gov]{.mark}ernment [to ensure that]{.mark} environmental
[taxes be clearly linked to real changes in
behaviour]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[Carbon Tax Act]{.mark},]{.underline} which has recently come into
effect in SA, [[aims to penalise large emitters of
g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}ases [to minimise]{.mark} the
[climate risks]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} According to a recent
report by the IMF, carbon tax is the best way to cut greenhouse gas
emissions, as it allows for a reduction in energy consumption, favours
cleaner energies and provides much-needed revenues, which could be used
to finance sustainable and more inclusive growth.

Outa's executive director, Dr Heinrich Volmink, made the call to the
government at a recent seminar on carbon tax organised by the Mail &
Guardian and Webber Wentzel.

"[[It would be disastrous if an issue]{.mark} as critical as climate
change [was used to simply raise more revenue without a]{.mark} clear
[link to behavioural change or acceleration in]{.mark} climate change
[mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline}."

The transport sector is a huge culprit when it comes to polluting the
atmosphere and subsequently our cities, and according to
citycarbonfootprints.com, Johannesburg ranks as the 13th worst polluted
city in the world.

Outa says [[there should be tangible]{.mark} and visible [alterations
to]{.mark} SA's [reactions to the carbon tax.]{.mark}]{.underline}

He said that [[five other environmental taxes already exist]{.mark}. The
[plastic bag]{.mark} levy, the [incandescent light bulb]{.mark} levy,
the [electricity]{.mark} levy, the [CO₂ tax on vehicle emissions]{.mark}
(2010/2011), [and the tyre levy]{.mark} have raised R90.795bn but [had
had far less of an effect than expected.]{.mark}]{.underline}

One example he mentions is the plastic bag levy, which started at 3c per
bag and is now 12c.

"[The [number of plastic bags produced per annum has actually gone
up]{.mark} --- from 2-billion in the first full year of the levy
(2005/2006) to just under 2.6-billion bags in 2018/2019. [So, what
changes in behaviour have occurred]{.mark}]{.underline}?" Volmink said.

"Arguably, if the money collected from this tax had been used to drive
the recycling industry, we may have seen some progress here."

Volmink called for a discussion on ring-fencing at least part of such
taxes.

"At the very least, [the government should clearly show all of the
revenue collected from environmental levies, including the carbon tax,
on the one hand, and the total expenditure related to climate change
mitigation on the other.]{.underline} Even if the revenue collected is
recycled into the general fiscus, there should at least be some
approximation between these two amounts," said Volmink.

"[[A carbon tax]{.mark}, however, [has a knock-on effect on
consumers]{.mark} in the form of raised fuel prices and potentially
increased living costs]{.underline}. Despite this, [[citizens should
have the fiscal right to see the correlation between revenue collection
and climate change mitigation]{.mark} in way that's clearly
understandable]{.underline}."

He said the government should look at using the revenue collected from
the carbon tax to support the introduction of new smarter mobility, such
as electric vehicles or increased public transport.

In order to become a zero-emissions society, the electrification of
transport is vital, said Generation.e co-founder and CEO Ben Pullen, who
is putting together the Electric Vehicle Road Trip Africa (EVRT Africa)
event in SA for the first time on October 2-10.

#### Look to B.C. for evidence carbon taxes fail

**[Dudley 18]{.underline}** (Brier Dudley is a member of The Seattle
Times editorial board. His columns appear regularly on editorial pages
of The Times. 1-25-2018, \"Look to B.C. for evidence carbon tax doesn't
work,\" Seattle Times,
https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/look-to-b-c-for-evidence-carbon-tax-doesnt-work/)

[[If Washington wants to reduce pollution]{.mark} and fare better on its
climate-change goals, [it should **reject**]{.mark} Gov. Jay Inslee's
**[proposed carbon tax]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Instead, [the state should put its efforts into environmental
regulations that directly and measurably reduce harmful
emissions.]{.underline}

As proposed, [[the carbon tax is a grab bag of handouts for the powerful
and politically connected]{.underline}]{.mark}, funded by a steep new
tax largely on the middle class. Many of the handouts have dubious
benefits in reducing emissions.

[[Carbon taxe]{.mark}s also [don't work]{.mark} as
promised]{.underline}. North America's first such tax, in neighboring
British Columbia, is failing to reduce emissions.

[[Emissions from driving are rising]{.mark} faster than population
growth in B.C., [despite a carbon tax higher than Inslee's
proposal]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Recent [data says emissions increased 2.3 percent from 2013 to
2015](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/climate-change/data/provincial-inventory/2015/2015_provincial_inventory.xlsx)]{.underline}.
That includes a 7.2 percent increase in transportation emissions, the
main focus of the B.C. and Washington plans.

[[B.C. won't]{.underline}]{.mark} [[[meet its 2020 carbon-reduction
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}](http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2015/05/10/b-c-failing-to-meet-greenhouse-emission-targets-federal-government.html).
Tax advocates there insist it works, but they're seeking an overhaul and
rate increase in hopes of meeting future climate goals.

Environmental group Food and Water Watch examined effects on the 70
percent of fuels subject to the tax. [It [concluded [B.C.'s tax is a
"failed
experiment]{.mark}"](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/british-columbia-carbon-tax-failed-experiment-market-based-solutions-climate-change)]{.underline}
and proponents "have significantly overstated the purported beneficial
effects."

"[[G]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as [emissions have been rising
rapidly]{.mark} in recent years [even as the tax rate]{.mark} and total
tax revenues [have increased]{.mark},"]{.underline} it said. "Moreover,
the short-term declines in taxed greenhouse gas emissions were more
modest and were reversed more quickly than the changes to the untaxed
greenhouse gas emissions --- exactly the opposite of what would happen
if carbon taxes had a causal impact on changing emissions."

[A cynical take is that [Washington's carbon tax is like Trump's border
wall. When first proposed, both were going to be free. Now they'll cost
taxpayers billions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most [don't
want](http://time.com/4752746/americans-oppose-donald-trump-border-wall/)
either (voters [said
no](https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20161108/State-Measures-Initiative-Measure-No-732-concerns-taxes.html)
to a "revenue neutral" carbon tax in 2016) and the benefits are
debatable, but they're being rammed through anyway.

State senators who introduced [Inslee's carbon tax in the
Legislature](http://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6203&Year=2017)
(SB 6203) are taking a new tack away from the original message that it
would reduce emissions by changing behavior.

Democratic Sens. Reuven Carlyle of Seattle and Guy Palumbo of Maltby say
the tax is still good policy because it would raise money for projects
they see as beneficial.

Their candor and dedication to reducing pollution are admirable, as is
Inslee's persistence. I'm looking forward to a revised proposal they'll
introduce soon.

But I'm not sold on the tax for several reasons.

[First, [many of the projects it would fund have questionable effects on
emissions]{.mark}. Inslee's [proposal reads like a Christmas list, with
goodies for developers]{.mark}, labor, transit advocates and even
Microsoft]{.underline} (the high-speed train it wants is a potential
beneficiary).

The plan exempts farms, airlines, shippers and certain factories from
the tax.

Investor-owned power companies would get carbon taxes back to cover
system upgrades. Inslee's plan would also repay loans they've taken for
capital projects. If I pollute, will he clear my remodeling debt?

Labor would help dole out billions to those affected by the evolving mix
of energy sources, which could be anyone and everyone, since the mix is
evolving no matter what. Recipients wouldn't have to show emission
reductions.

This all builds political support but also feeds skepticism about the
sincerity of climate-change remedies.

[[Second, clearly beneficial projects on the list]{.mark}, such as
power-system upgrades, will or [should happen already because of
existing regulations]{.mark} and market demand for cleaner
power]{.underline}. Polluters should do this work without subsidies from
working-class families. Instead of buying them off, regulate them.

[Third, [the plan would fund clean-energy ventures, but these ventures
don't need money from carpenters in Tacoma]{.mark} driving pickups or
farmworkers heating homes in Mattawa]{.underline}. More than \$1
trillion for such ventures was raised the last three years, including
nearly \$200 billion in the U.S., according to Bloomberg. Bill Gates
started a \$1 billion clean-energy fund.

Fortunes will be made in clean energy, and investors are lining up.
Don't tap households for more.

Besides, public investments in such ventures have a terrible record,
including Washington's 2006 foray into
[biofuels](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/biofuel-backlash-high-prices-pollution-worries-hit-consumers/).

[[Even if the carbon tax worked, it's terribly
regressive]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Past federal research has found that [[increasing fuel costs doesn't
necessarily lead to a]{.mark} corresponding [drop in
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}. Households just pay more and have less
money for food, clothing and other needs.

Token rebates for the poor won't make it progressive. The burden still
falls harder on the lower middle class.

[[This exacerbates the proposal's elitism]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's
pushed by Seattle residents with options to avoid the tax, since the
area has density, extensive transit and hydroelectricity.

Lacking such options, the other 90 percent of Washington will be forced
to pay more and more, because the tax increases at least 3.5 percent per
year.

[Over four years, the tax [would generate \$3.3
billion](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/gov-inslee-to-release-carbon-tax-proposal-tuesday/)]{.underline}.
Averaged across the state's 2.7 million households, that's about
\$1,200. Good thing the minimum wage increased.

If politicians want to collect billions to fund green and quasi-green
projects, let's discuss that and whether it should happen with
regressive taxes.

[Climate change is real and needs a strong response, not pricey,
feel-good measures that don't work as promised.]{.underline}

#### Carbon taxes can't overcome economics

**[Marchand and Ebell 18]{.underline}** (Ross Marchand is director of
policy at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance. Myron Ebell is director of
the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise
Institute. 7-25-2019, \"A carbon tax would be a costly failure,\"
Washington Examiner,
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/a-carbon-tax-would-be-a-costly-failure)

Recently, some Republicans have developed the rather unfortunate habit
of floating tax increases shortly after cutting taxes. The Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017, reduced taxes on more than
90 percent of households and gave the average family of four a [\$2,000
boost](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/numbers-tax-cuts-jobs-act-delivers-tax-cuts-families-every-congressional-district-2/)
just in time for Christmas. But then, mumblings over tax increases
began. As the [Competitive Enterprise
Institute](https://cei.org/blog/here-we-go-again-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-and-peter-navarro)
and the [Taxpayers Protection
Alliance](https://www.protectingtaxpayers.org/blog/a/view/summer-reading-axe-the-tariffs)
have pointed out, the administration's recently enacted tariffs, which
is nothing more than an import tax, will likely cost millions of jobs
and raise prices on everything from foodstuffs to new homes.

As if that were not enough, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., [[recently
introduced]{.mark} a [bill]{.mark} that [would establish a \$23 per-ton
carbon tax]{.mark} on oil refineries, gas processing plants, and coal
mine]{.underline} mouths beginning in 2020. E&E News
[reports](https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060089315/print) that,
"Industrial sectors such as cement, aluminum, steel and glass would also
pay the fee for emissions stemming from physical or chemical reactions
outside of energy production." Wh[ile the legislation eliminates the
federal gasoline tax, [the net impact of such a steep carbon tax would
be disastrous for working families]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite dubious
claims that carbon taxes can avert climate change and promote
"renewables," [this [misguided policy will only succeed in fleecing
Americans struggling to keep the lights on]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Trying to figure out how much more working families will have to pay
under the proposed carbon tax is a tricky exercise, since previous
estimates covered different proposals. But virtually all studies
analyzing carbon tax proposals have come to the same conclusions: Fiscal
impacts are significant and disproportionately harm low-income
households. [In 2010, researchers from the University of Wisconsin and
Stanford University
[found](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-010-9345-x)
that a \$15-per-ton tax on carbon results in the poorest one-fifth of
households paying \$325 extra a year for gas and
electricity.]{.underline} In [paying the
tax](http://www.nber.org/digest/jan10/w15239.html), "[the burden as a
percent of annual income is much higher among lower income groups than
higher income groups."]{.underline}

In a 2013 review of the evidence, Brookings Institution scholars William
G. Gale, Samuel Brown, and Fernando Saltie
[concurred](https://www.brookings.edu/research/carbon-taxes-as-part-of-the-fiscal-solution/)
that [carbon taxes will almost certainly fall upon low-income folks
rather than their wealthier counterparts, with virtually all estimates
ranging in hundreds of dollars annually.]{.underline}

[[It makes no sense to craft a policy that will increase energy bills on
millions of vulnerable Americans]{.mark}.]{.underline} But, to "green"
advocates, the answer is seemingly simple: Getting America off of carbon
will clear the air and avert a catastrophic change in climate. While
it's impossible to sum up decades of climatology research in a few
paragraphs, [[the case for a carbon tax is flimsy even if we assume that
carbon impacts climate]{.underline}]{.mark}. As it turns out, [[the
economy is complex and impossible to steer toward a narrow]{.mark},
preordained [outcome]{.mark} dreamed up by bureaucrats.]{.underline}

As left-leaning economist Hans-Werner Sinn [points
out](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/sternn/ClimateChange&theGreenParadoxDESifoForumMay2016.pdf),
[[energy producers would likely respond to a]{.mark}n impending carbon
[tax by increasing supplies in the here-and-now, crashing the price and
encouraging more carbon emissions in the present]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Whoops!

This idea, known as the "[[Green Paradox," is true]{.mark} if oil and
gas companies are flexible enough to change their output quickly in
response to changing policies]{.underline}. Wrongly [assuming the
opposite](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/04/and-now-case-against-carbon-tax/)(that
energy suppliers aren't as adaptable as Sinn predicts) implies that gas
prices will likely rise in coming decades due to exploding demand across
the globe. If energy suppliers prove inflexible in meeting this
increased demand, they'll go out of business with or without a carbon
tax.

All of these hypotheticals lead to a sobering conclusion: [[Economic
realities]{.mark} will likely [doom a carbon tax to fail]{.mark}.
Economies are complex instruments that always defy central planners,
derailing even the best-laid plans. [Policymakers must steer clear of
this poor]{.mark}ly thought out [proposal that will achieve little at a
gargantuan cost.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Lawmakers can preserve the legacy of tax reform by avoiding expensive
schemes to engineer ecology]{.underline}. Republicans who passed
historic tax reform would be wise to avoid passing a tax increase that
could wipe out any savings from the tax reform.

#### Carbon taxes are regressive and inadequately account for low-income households 

**[Baranzini et al 17]{.underline}** (Baranzini, A., van den Bergh, J.
C., Carattini, S., Howarth, R. B., Padilla, E. and Roca, J. (2017),
Carbon pricing in climate policy: seven reasons, complementary
instruments, and political economy considerations. WIREs Clim Change, 8:
e462. doi:[10.1002/wcc.462](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.462))

PE Issue 1: Distributional Consequences of Carbon Pricing

[Much [resistance against carbon pricing is motivated by concerns that
it will]{.mark}]{.underline} be inequitable, that is, [[have regressive
distributional effects in terms of income]{.mark} or consumers'
purchasing power]{.underline}. Of course, [[any serious climate policy
could have similar]{.mark}, undesirable distributional
[impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of carbon pricing, however,
regressive impacts are not inevitable. They can be avoided through
appropriate policy design or complementary measures. Moreover, when
considering the distributive consequences of carbon pricing, it is
important to compare these to alternative scenarios, notably
business‐as‐usual (no climate policies) and climate mitigation policies
with alternative, and less effective, instruments. For instance, many
studies show that unmitigated climate change impacts would be unequal
among countries and that poorest countries will be more affected than
richer.[62](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0062)

Paradoxically, [carbon pricing provides an excellent instrument to
address undesirable distributional consequences]{.underline}---notably
if taking the form of carbon taxation, but also of emissions trading, if
initial permits are auctioned or sold. The reason is that [it will
generate public revenues that can be used to compensate low‐income
households]{.underline}, for example, [through tax reductions for low
incomes or energy poor households]{.underline}, or lower value‐added tax
(VAT) rates for products serving basic
needs.[63](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0063)-[65](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0065)
[Progressive effects can also be obtained by lump sum
redistribution]{.underline}, which represents the simplest and
administratively less burdensome way of recycling revenues from carbon
pricing.[66](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0066)-[68](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0068)

Any remaining distributional impacts of carbon pricing have to be
compared with those resulting from climate change or other climate
policy instruments. For example, technical standards will not
necessarily guarantee an equitable distribution of emissions reductions
and associated monetary and welfare costs. In particular, they will also
raise costs and thus prices, but not generate extra public revenues that
could be used to lessen perceived unfair distributive impacts. In a
review of arguments and empirical studies, one study warns that
assessing distributional effects of environmental policy (any
instrument, not only pricing) is a difficult task, as it involves six
elements: (1) higher prices of carbon‐intensive products, (2) changes in
relative returns to factors such as labor, capital, and resources, (3)
allocation of scarcity rents from a restricted number of tradable
permits in the case these are initially freely distributed, (4)
distribution of the benefits from improvements in environmental quality,
(5) temporary effects during the transition, and (6) capitalization of
all those effects into prices of property values (land, buildings, and
houses).[69](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0069)
A full assessment should account for all of them, which clarifies the
huge challenge to comprehensively address distributive impacts of
policy[. It means one should be careful in quickly judging a particular
instrument, like carbon pricing, negatively from the angle of equity. It
should further be noted that in the case of climate change, the
[beneficiaries of reducing emissions are future generations]{.mark},
notably people living in poor countries. [Hence, carbon pricing can
contribute to both intra‐ and intergenerational
equity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A general finding of the literature on acceptability of climate policy,
and in particular of carbon taxes, is [that [people tend to have a
strong preference for designs that protect low‐income
households]{.mark}]{.underline}.[70](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0070)-[73](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0073)
Concern about income [[inequality is]{.mark} among [the main reasons why
92% of voters]{.mark}]{.underline} (more than two million people) in a
public ballot held in Switzerland in 2015 [[rejected a proposal for an
energy tax]{.mark}]{.underline} to replace the national
VAT.[74](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.462#wcc462-bib-0074)
The authors of this study show, using a choice experiment administered
at the same time of the ballot, that acceptability is much higher when a
progressive energy tax is proposed, provided that information on its
distributional properties are made salient.

When considering redistribution effects of climate policies, one should
realize that [[a subsidy scheme for adopting renewable
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}---not to be confused with innovation
subsidies as discussed in the More Than Carbon Pricing section---[[may
be regressive as well]{.mark}, namely [when it involves a considerable
transfer of money to homeowners]{.mark}]{.underline}, notably for
installing solar PV panels on roofs. This type of scheme was introduced
in a number of countries (e.g., Germany and Switzerland) as carbon
pricing turned out to be unpopular. But, as argued, subsidies do not
necessarily perform better, neither on (cost‐)effectiveness nor on
equity. The distributional effect should be carefully analyzed in each
specific case as it will depend on the precise design of the subsidy
scheme.

It is a standard tenet of public choice theory that [people do not like
high taxes]{.underline}. It is not immediately obvious, however, that
[the same sentiment should extend to environmental taxes such as those
on carbon]{.underline}. Environmental taxes are Pigovian taxes (after
Pigou,
[1920](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0077)),
put in place to correct a market failure. Voters may accept them on the
grounds that they address a problem people care about. [Yet empirical
studies consistently find that the standard objection to high taxes also
holds for carbon taxes]{.underline} (Brännlund & Persson,
[2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0018);
Carattini et al.,

Gevrek & Uyduranoglu,
[2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0044);
Sælen & Kallbekken,
[2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0080);
Thalmann,
[2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0089)).
People\'s attitudes to carbon taxes appear to be influenced more by the
direct personal cost of the measure than by an appreciation of the
environmental objective (Kallbekken, Kroll, & Cherry,
[2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0062)).

Consequently, [the public acceptability of an environmental tax depends
heavily on its policy stringency]{.underline}, since the [proposed tax
rate determines the direct costs to consumers. Aversion to higher tax
rates is even found when revenues are redistributed to the
population]{.underline}. That is, [[voters]{.mark} tend to [dislike
sudden changes to taxation even if]{.mark}, on paper, [these may not
make them worse off]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The effect of tax levels on acceptability can be measured relatively
precisely with choice experiments. For instance, Sælen and Kallbekken
([2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0080))
assessed the acceptability of fuel taxes in Norway, analyzing the
responses of 1,147 survey participants. [Brännlund and Persson
([2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0018))
studied the acceptability of carbon taxes with a survey of 2,400 Swedish
citizens. Gevrek and Uyduranoglu
([2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0044))
surveyed 1,252 individuals from 16 Turkish cities about their attitude
to a carbon tax. All three studies found that the [acceptability of a
tax proposal decreases with the personal cost]{.mark} it would impose on
survey respondents.]{.underline}

Two Swiss studies have used voter surveys to analyze the drivers of
public opposition in public ballots. Thalmann
([2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0089))
analyzed the responses of a representative sampling of 990 Swiss
residents after a referendum in the year 2000 on three different energy
tax proposals, all of which were rejected. [While the [magnitude]{.mark}
of the tax rate was not a decisive factor for most voters, Thalmann
showed that it [was important to a fraction of voters with a particular
concern about the]{.mark} cost of the [tax]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Carattini et al.
([2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0022))
analyze another tax proposal, put forward in 2015, which was rejected by
92% of voters. The proposal entailed a tax swap in which a new energy
tax on nonrenewable energy would have generated the same revenues as
value‐added tax, which would have disappeared completely. The complete
replacement of the value‐added tax, and the constraint to keep revenues
constant over time, would have implied a high, and growing, tax rate.
This concern, and its implications for distributional and
competitiveness effects, led, among other factors examined in the paper,
to the massive rejection in the ballot. To analyze how alternative tax
designs could have performed in a ballot, Carattini et al.
([2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-bib-0022))
administered a second survey, a choice experiment with a representative
sample of 1,200 Swiss voters. [The researchers found that the
[acceptability of the tax]{.mark} almost [linearly decreased as the tax
rate]{.mark}s [increased]{.mark} (see Figure
[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.531#wcc531-fig-0001)).
They also found that [people with low levels of climate change concern
showed a higher sensitivity to tax rates]{.mark}, while people with
stronger climate change concern paid less attention to price
levels.]{.underline}

1\) [Abolish the electoral college]{.underline}

"[[The electoral college is a disaster for a
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}." So said Donald Trump on election night
in 2012, when it looked for a brief moment as if Mitt Romney might win
the popular vote against Barack Obama. Today, of course, Trump sits in
the Oval Office as a result of [that very same electoral
college]{.underline} -- which, unbeknownst to many Americans, [[was
created **to boost**]{.mark} **the [political power of
slave]{.mark}-owning southern [states]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Since the start of this century, the United States has elected two
Republican presidents -- Trump and George W Bush -- who lost the
national popular vote but won the majority of electoral college votes.
How so? The electoral college elevates smaller, rural Republican states
at the expense of bigger, more urban Democratic states. Compare
California to Wyoming: the former has one electoral vote per 712,000
people, while the latter has one per 195,000 people. That means a vote
in Wyoming has 3.6 times the impact in the electoral college as a vote
in California.

[The core of [democracy is supposed to be the principle of one]{.mark}
person]{.underline}, one vote, [[but the electoral college makes a
mockery of that]{.mark} principle]{.underline}. And guess what? **[[Most
Americans agree]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In June, a PRRI poll found that
two-thirds (68 per cent) of Americans would prefer electing their
presidents on the basis of the national popular vote, as opposed to the
electoral college.

Abolishing the electoral college won't be easy. It would need a
constitutional amendment, which itself requires a two-thirds vote in
both the House and the Senate and the ratification of three-quarters
(38) of the 50 states.

There is, however, an alternative to outright abolition. The National
Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement between a
growing number of US states to pool their electoral college votes for
the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote. The agreement is
supposed to take effect once the participating states represent at least
270 electoral votes, the minimum number required to elect a president.
As of October 2018, the NPVIC had been adopted by 11 states which,
between them, have 172 electoral votes or 32 per cent of the total
Electoral College.

2\) Pass a new Voting Rights Act

Turnout in the United States is abysmally low by international standards
-- according to a Pew study in May 2018, the US came 26th out of 32 OECD
countries. But Republicans are bent on reducing it even further. Voter
suppression has become an integral part of the GOP's election strategy
at the federal and state levels. Take Georgia, where Republican
gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp -- who, as secretary of state, also
doubles as Georgia's top election official -- is trying to block 53,000
people from registering to vote, nearly 70 per cent of whom are black.
His Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, is black.

In 2013, conservatives on the Supreme Court gutted a key section of the
landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act which had required state and local
governments in areas with a history of racial discrimination to obtain
federal "preclearance" before making any changes to their voting laws.
The Democrats, if they retake the House and the Senate, should
immediately pass a new, beefed-up Voting Rights Act, which would:

-- Prohibit racist voter ID laws at the state level. Over the past
decade, more than a dozen Republican-led states have introduced
restrictive voter ID laws. Their justification? To combat (mythical)
voter fraud. The reality? A 2017 academic study found "a significant
drop in minority participation when and where these laws are
implemented".

-- Mandate that every state automatically register every voter. Thirteen
states plus the District of Columbia have already approved automatic
voter registration (AVR). In 2016, after Oregon introduced AVR, the
state's turnout increased by 4 per cent compared to the 2012 elections.

\- Restore the right to vote to ex-felons. In the swing state of
Florida, more than one in ten people of voting age -- and a whopping one
in five black adults! -- are barred from voting due to a felony
conviction. In total, and nationwide, around six million Americans with
a felony conviction are currently disenfranchised -- some of them for
life. As the Sentencing Project points out: "We know of no other
democracy besides the United States in which convicted offenders who
have served their sentences are nonetheless disenfranchised for life."

-- Make election day a federal holiday. Countries such as Germany,
France, Spain, Brazil and India either vote at the weekend or recognize
election day as a public holiday. One recent study found that "creating
a national holiday for election day would increase voter turnout by
about 16 percentage points" and cause "voter turnout in the US to be
consistent with other developed democracies."

3\) [Ban gerrymandering]{.underline}

[[Is there **anything more**]{.mark} **brazenly
[anti-democratic]{.mark}** [than redrawing]{.mark} the [boundaries of
electoral districts to secure a partisan advantage? **That's
gerrymandering**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Take [Pennsylvania]{.mark}]{.underline}. In November 2012, according to
the Washington Post, "[[Democratic candidates]{.mark} for the state's 18
US House seats [won 51 percent of their state's popular House
vote]{.mark}. But [that translated to]{.mark} just [5 out of 18]{.mark},
or a little more than one-quarter, of the state's [House
seats]{.mark}.]{.underline}" How come? Because [Republicans had drawn
ridiculously-skewed district maps the year before.]{.underline}

Republicans in control of statehouses and governors' mansions across the
United States have gerrymandered their way to the "the most audacious
political heist of modern times," in the words of investigative
journalist David Daley. Remember, as political scientist Lee Drutman, of
the New America think tank, observed in January, "[Gerrymandering is
largely a US phenomenon]{.underline} ... We're the only country that
uses single-member districts but doesn't use independent districting
commissions to draw them."

Americans from across the political spectrum have expressed their
dislike of gerrymandering. A bipartisan poll conducted by the Campaign
Legal Center in September 2017 found that 71 per cent of respondents,
including 65 per cent of Republicans, want the Supreme Court to define
"clear, new rules" that end blatant partisan gerrymandering.

There is, however, a glimmer of light on the horizon: in Michigan, an
anti-gerrymandering ballot measure, calling for an amendment to the
state's constitution that would put redistricting in the hands of an
independent commission, will go to a statewide vote in November. If
voters in Michigan vote Yes, expect other states to follow their lead.

### 2NC -- Electoral College

#### Perception changes such as the aff don't work

The Supreme Court's misguided 5-4 Citizens United v. FEC ruling
authorized corporations to spend limitless amounts of money influencing
elections. In the majority opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy,
[[the Court claimed]{.mark} "The [appearance of influence]{.mark} or
access [will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[**[They were wrong]{.mark}.** With Congress ending last year with a
public approval rating of 14%, the electorate isn't just losing faith in
this democracy --- **[it's totally gone]{.mark}**. [Every
year]{.mark}]{.underline} since the Citizens United ruling, [special
interest groups and [corporations have been one-upping their own
electoral spending]{.mark}]{.underline} from the previous year with TV
ads and media buys. All this spending recently slammed us with a nearly
\$4 billion midterm last November.

But the Citizens United ruling also detonated a massive movement built
on people power to get big money out of politics. 89% of Americans agree
that there is too much corporate money in politics and we're doing
something about it.

Over 140 organizations and [[millions of activists have banded together
to counteract the]{.mark} Supreme Court's [nefarious slash-and-burn of
campaign finance restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}, implemented to
safeguard our democratic process from becoming a plutocracy where the
wealthy few call all the shots.

In the last five years, 16 states and over 600 cities and towns passed
measures calling on Congress to support an amendment to overturn
Citizens United. And in September 2014, the U.S. Senate voted for an
amendment proposal to reverse Citizens United - only 12 votes shy of the
requisite three-fourths majority.

The anti-corruption group, Represent.us - allying with both liberal and
conservative groups - worked hard to successfully pass the
Anti-Corruption Act in Tallahassee, Florida. This year they are taking
the model bill to more cities and states.

[Over 30,000 people are legally rubber-stamping messages like "Not to be
used for bribing politicians" and "Stamp money out of politics" onto
their currency]{.underline} with the grassroots campaign, Stamp
Stampede. They are turning money into media by creating millions of
mini-billboards and creating a mass visual demonstration of support. I
call it a petition on steroids. It's a simple action that anybody,
anywhere can do anytime.

As this month marks the fifth anniversary of the Citizens United ruling,
hundreds of folks are walking for days in the freezing New Hampshire
winter to protest corruption in politics with the New Hampshire
Rebellion group. Over 50 events all around the country are being held to
educate the public on the toxic outcomes of the Citizens United case.

#### The electoral college is bad -- people want it gone

Democracy,\" The New York Times, accessed 7-24-2019,
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/opinion/the-electoral-college.html \]

It's still well under the radar, but [[the movement to circumvent the
Electoral College gained ground]{.mark} this week]{.underline}. On
Sunday, [Jared Polis, the governor of Colorado, said he would sign a
bill to join the National Popular Vote interstate compact, whose members
have pledged to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national
popular vote. The Maine Legislature, likewise, is mulling membership and
will hold hearings to discuss the issue.]{.underline}

Attacking those lawmakers, Paul LePage, the former governor of Maine ---
who still calls into conservative radio shows from his retirement home
in Florida --- dismissed the proposal as an attack on the political
rights of white people. "Actually what would happen if they do what they
say they're going to do is white people will not have anything to say,"
he said. "It's only going to be the minorities that would elect. It
would be California, Texas, Florida."

That is racist nonsense. But it's useful to think about, in a way,
because beneath LePage's objection is an unintentionally keen
observation about the electoral status quo. [If direct election of the
president would give equal weight to all votes, then the Electoral
College works to give outsize weight to a narrow group of voters in a
handful of states]{.underline}. That bias is why Donald Trump is
president. A healthy plurality chose his opponent, but his supporters
dominated key "swing" states.

It could happen again. A 2018 report on America's future political
demography found four realistic scenarios in which Democrats win the
national popular vote but lose the Electoral College because of the
geography of the electorate. The 2020 election could be the third time
in six elections that the White House went to the loser of the popular
vote.

That is why Electoral College reform deserves a prominent place in the
national conversation, especially as the Democratic Party champions a
host of pro-democracy reforms, such as public financing of elections and
an end to gerrymandering.

As it stands, the most visible Democrat speaking against it is the
former Attorney General Eric Holder, who on Tuesday called for its
abolition. "Time to make Electoral College a vestige of the past," he
said on Twitter. "It's undemocratic, forces candidates to ignore
majority of the voters and campaign in a small number of states. The
presidency is our one national office and should be decided --- directly
--- by the voters."

Of course, there are not enough votes in Congress or the states to pass
and ratify an amendment abolishing the Electoral College. Beyond
partisan politics --- Republicans currently benefit from its distortions
--- there's sentimental attachment to the institution, tied to popular
mythology about the Constitution. In this view, the Electoral College is
one of the great compromises of the Constitutional Convention, part of
the wisdom and genius of the "founding fathers" who sought a middle path
between pure democracy on the one hand and anti-majoritarianism on the
other.

The truth is less noble. [[The Electoral College was]{.mark} actually [a
workaround]{.mark} meant to satisfy a divided Constitutional Convention
at the cost of actual functionality]{.underline}. The framers considered
three ways to elect a president.

Roger Sherman of Connecticut proposed election by Congress, to make the
executive "absolutely dependent on that body, as it was the will of that
which was to be executed."

Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania proposed popular election. "If the
people should elect," Morris said, "they will never fail to prefer some
man of distinguished character, or services; some man, if he might so
speak, of continental reputation."

Objections came from George Mason of Virginia, who thought "the extent
of the Country renders it impossible that the people can have the
requisite capacity to judge of the respective pretensions of the
Candidates"--- and other Southern delegates who feared domination by the
largest states. "The most populous States by combining in favor of the
same individual will be able to carry their points," said Charles
Pinckney of South Carolina.

Southern opposition came with obvious subtext. By population, South
Carolina was the seventh largest of 13 states. Maryland was the sixth.
North Carolina was the third. And Virginia was a colossus --- the
largest state in the incipient union. But large minorities of their
residents were enslaved. In Virginia, it was roughly 40 percent, giving
the state a smaller voting population than its more populous neighbors
to the north.

Hugh Williamson of North Carolina made this point explicit in his
objection: Because there won't always be "distinguished characters" with
national recognition who could win a majority of votes, "the people will
be sure to vote for some man in their own State, and the largest State
will be sure to succeed." But this will not be Virginia, "since her
slaves will have no suffrage."

James Madison, another Virginian, actually favored popular election of
the president but saw the writing on the wall. "The right of suffrage
was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern states," he
said a few days later as discussion continued, "and the latter could
have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes."

Debate over executive election began in mid-July. It resumed in late
August, and the framers settled on a solution in early September, less
than two weeks before the convention would adjourn. Their compromise
centered on an idea introduced at the start of the discussion: Instead
of direct election or election by legislature, states would choose
electors who would then elect the president and vice president from a
group of candidates. To preserve an element of popular election, each
state would receive electors equal to its congressional delegation,
which would also account for states with large enslaved populations,
since the convention had already reached agreement on how to count
slaves for legislative apportionment. If no candidate received a
majority, the election would go to Congress.

The historian Jack Rakove notes how few of the framers "expected the
electors to do anything more than nominate candidates." They would
winnow the field, and then elected representatives would actually choose
the president.

The system worked as intended in two elections: 1789, when George
Washington won his first time, and 1792, when he won again. Its flaws
were apparent by 1796, when John Adams became president with the
runner-up Thomas Jefferson as his vice president, despite being
opponents who had running mates aligned with their political factions.
The following year, in response to this fiasco, a South Carolina
congressman introduced an amendment requiring each elector to cast
separate votes for president and vice president.

It would take deadlock to force action. In 1800, Jefferson ran again
against Adams with Aaron Burr as his running mate. Their party, the
Democratic-Republicans, won a majority of voters (a scant 67,282 ballots
out of a free white male population of roughly one million and a total
adult population of more than two million) and electors. But those
electors cast an equal number of votes for Jefferson and Burr, forcing
the election into the House of Representatives, where a lame-duck
Federalist majority saw its chance to stymie Jefferson.

Burr was poised to become president despite not actually standing for
the office. It took months of heated political conflict --- with
Alexander Hamilton, a Federalist, lobbying the House to choose Jefferson
--- to resolve the standoff. After dozens of ballots, Jefferson was
elected president. To keep another such crisis from blowing up the
political system, Congress passed the 12th Amendment to the
Constitution, ratified in 1804, which distinguished clearly between
votes for president and vice president and streamlined other elements of
the process.

[The [history]{.mark} of the Electoral College from this point
[is]{.mark} of [Americans working around the institution]{.mark},
[grafting majoritarian norms and procedures on]{.mark}to the political
process [and hoping]{.mark}, every four years, [for a sensible
outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. And **[[on an almost regular schedule, it
has done]{.mark} just [the opposite]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
presidency went to the popular-vote loser in 1824 (John Quincy Adams;
his opponent, Andrew Jackson, also won the most electoral votes), 1876
and 1888. In the 20th century, Americans had close calls in the
elections of 1948, 1960, 1968 and 1976, with near splits in the popular
and electoral vote. Despite winning the popular vote in six of the past
seven presidential elections, Democrats have held the presidency for
only four of those terms, under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

[This]{.underline} obvious dysfunction [is why the Electoral College has
been a source of persistent dissatisfaction]{.underline}, with
generations of lawmakers introducing new proposals for modifying or
abolishing the system outright. Indeed, after the 1968 election, a
commission of the American Bar Association recommended "direct popular
election of the president," calling the "Electoral College method of
electing a president of the United States archaic, undemocratic,
complex, ambiguous, indirect, and dangerous."

None of this has changed. The Electoral College routinely threatens or
produces perverse outcomes, where the will of the voters is thwarted by
an ill-considered 18th-century electoral device. It has no place in a
democracy that strives for a standard of "one person, one vote." And
most Americans still don't like it. In a 2018 survey from the Public
Religion Research Institute, 65 percent said presidents should be
elected by popular vote.

The simplest solution for circumventing the Electoral College is the
National Popular Vote interstate compact I mentioned earlier, which
would take effect once the member states made up a majority of electoral
votes.

[[Americans worried about disadvantaging small states]{.mark} and rural
areas in presidential elections [should consider how our current system
gives]{.mark} presidential [candidates few reasons to campaign in states
where the outcome is]{.mark} a [foregone]{.mark}
conclusion.]{.underline} For example, more people live in rural counties
in California, New York and Illinois that are solidly red than live in
Wyoming, Montana, Alaska and the Dakotas, which haven't voted for a
Democratic presidential candidate in decades. In a national contest for
votes, Republicans have every reason to mobilize and build turnout in
these areas. But in a fight for states, these rural minorities are
irrelevant. The same is true of blue cities in red states, where
Democratic votes are essentially wasted.

[[Candidates would campaign everywhere]{.mark} they might win
votes]{.underline}, the way politicians already do in statewide races.
[[Political parties would seek out supporters]{.mark} regardless of
region]{.underline}. A Republican might seek votes in New England (more
than a million Massachusetts voters backed Donald Trump in 2016) while a
Democrat might do the same in the Deep South (twice as many people voted
for Hillary Clinton in Louisiana as in New Mexico).
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[might give nonvoters a reason to
care about the process since]{.mark} in a truly national election,
**[votes count]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

If nothing else, our quadrennial game of political hot potato can
finally come to an end. We can close off this glaring flaw in our
political system and stop worrying about another president who lost the
popular vote by millions and the anger, rancor and mistrust that comes
with that.

But the inertia behind the Electoral College is strong, which is why it
needs vocal opponents making their case as loudly and often as possible.
That includes Democratic politicians, including the group running for
president. A primary campaign is the perfect forum for raising the
issue, giving it high-profile support and wide attention. That, in turn,
might move Americans from passive dissatisfaction with the status quo to
action against it. [[Eventually]{.mark} --- and really it can't come too
soon --- [Americans could at least vote **as though they live in a
modern democracy**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The electoral college is undemocratic -- ending it solves

\]

In February, I wrote about the Electoral College, its origins and its
problems. [[Whatever its potential merits, it is]{.mark} a [plainly
undemocratic]{.mark} institution. [It undermines the principle of "**one
person, one vote**]{.mark},"]{.underline} affirmed in 1964 by the
Supreme Court in Reynolds v. Sims --- a key part of the civil and voting
rights revolution of that decade. [[It produces recurring political
crises]{.mark}. And [it threatens to delegitimize the entire political
system by creating larger]{.mark} and larger [splits between who wins
the public and]{.mark} who wins [the states]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Many readers disagreed, making arguments similar to those used by the
president and his allies. [But those [claims]{.mark} --- that [the
Electoral College ensures rural representation]{.mark}, that its
counter-majoritarian outcomes reflect the intentions of the framers and
that it keeps large states from dominating small ones --- [don't follow
from the facts]{.mark}]{.underline} and are rooted more in folk civics
than in how the system plays out in reality.

Take rural representation. [[If you conceive]{.mark} of [rural America
as]{.mark} a set of [states]{.mark}, [the Electoral College does give
voters in Iowa or Montana or Wyoming a sizable say]{.mark} in the
selection of the president]{.underline}. [If you conceive of it as a
population of voters]{.underline}, on the other hand, [the picture is
different]{.underline}. Roughly [60 million Americans live in rural
counties]{.underline}, and [they aren't all concentrated in "rural"
states]{.underline}. Millions live in large and midsize states like
California, New York, Illinois, Alabama and South Carolina.

With a national popular vote for president, you could imagine a
Republican campaign that links rural voters in California --- where five
million people live in rural counties --- to those in New York, where
roughly 1.4 million people live in rural counties. In other words, rural
interests would be represented from coast to coast, as opposed to a
system that only weights those who live in swing states.

[Totaling the 2016 numbers]{.underline}, Sam Wang, a molecular biologist
at Princeton who also runs a widely read election website, found that
[out of almost 400 campaign stops made after the conventions, neither
Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump made appearances in Arkansas, Oregon,
Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, the Dakotas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
Mississippi, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West
Virginia or Vermont]{.underline}. [It doesn't matter that Trump won
millions of votes in New Jersey or that Hillary Clinton won millions in
Texas]{.underline}. [[If your state is reliably red or blue**, you are
ignored**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

By contrast, [[under]{.mark} a [national popular vote]{.mark}, the
[margin of]{.mark} your [loss within a state matters]{.mark} as much as
the size of your win.]{.underline} [Democrats would have reason to
maximize their share]{.underline} of the vote [in the Deep
South]{.underline}, and [Republicans would see the same incentive in the
Northeast]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} the [West]{.underline} for
that matter).

Still, [[you might argue, the Electoral College keeps large states from
dominating]{.mark} small ones]{.underline}. If there were no such
system, campaigns could win by focusing all their attention on the
largest states. As a matter of math, [[that is
unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2016, [New York, California, Texas and
Florida cast about 35 million ballots]{.underline}, roughly [a quarter
of the total 137 million]{.underline}. Even if you somehow won every
single one of those ballots, you'd still have to campaign elsewhere for
tens of millions more votes, assuming a 50 percent threshold. Take the
total of 2016 presidential votes in the 10 largest states, and you'd get
only 71 million ballots, or about 52 percent of the vote.

In the incredible event that a candidate won every ballot cast in those
states, then yes, under a national popular vote, he or she could ignore
the rest of the country and become president. But that isn't politically
possible. Even an attempt to "run up the score" and retreat to the
largest cities isn't viable --- there just aren't enough votes.

[[Compare that with]{.mark} what we have under [the Electoral
College]{.mark}]{.underline}, where hypothetically **[[a bare majority
in the 11 largest states is all it takes to win]{.underline}]{.mark}**
270 electors and become president --- an actual instance of big-state
domination.

Beyond the numbers, [it is a conceptual error to focus on states in a
race for votes]{.underline}. Who wins Virginia has implications for
down-ballot races for Congress, but it's just a curiosity in the fight
for the White House. What would count are voters and communities, and
candidates would have multiple avenues for building majority coalitions
across state lines.

This gets to a larger point. As James Madison observed during the
Constitutional Convention, [the political interests of the states aren't
actually tied to size. Instead, whether states share interests will
depend on shared conditions and connections.]{.underline} Massachusetts
and Tennessee have populations of similar size but little in common
otherwise; Massachusetts and Connecticut, on the other hand, are linked
by history and geography.

In modern politics, intrastate political differences are as important as
interstate ones. Voters in Milwaukee may have more in common with voters
in Richmond, Va., than they do with those in Superior in the northwest
of the state. A national campaign would probably follow suit, with
candidates looking for connections between regions, cities and
metropolitan areas versus a singular focus on a few states.

It is true [the founders feared "mob rule" and "pure
democracy]{.underline}." [But electing a president **isn't the same as
either**]{.underline}. When Madison referred to "pure democracy" in
Federalist No. 10, he meant direct governance by the people. "A society
consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer
the government in person." He contrasted this with representative
democracy, or "republican" government. And while Madison agreed to an
Electoral College, he also saw the merit of choosing a chief executive
by popular election.

"The people at large," he argued during the Constitutional Convention,
"would be as likely as any that could be devised to produce an Executive
Magistrate of distinguished Character. The people generally could only
know & vote for some Citizen whose merits had rendered him an object of
general attention & esteem." His main reservation was slavery and how it
made "the right of suffrage" more "diffusive in the Northern than the
Southern States."

Beyond issues of representation, there are other practical problems with
the status quo. When margins between candidates are large, the Electoral
College aligns with the national popular vote. But narrow margins throw
it into chaos. The 1968 presidential election nearly went to the House
of Representatives; in 1976, if you move roughly 6,000 ballots from
Jimmy Carter in Ohio and roughly 18,000 in Wisconsin and Gerald Ford
becomes president despite losing by nearly 1.7 million votes.

Indeed, the recurring prospect of a president elected with a minority of
the vote inspired a major push to end the Electoral College beginning in
the 1960s. In 1966, Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana --- who died last week
at 91 --- introduced a constitutional amendment to elect the president
by national popular vote. In 1968, Bayh spoke before a committee of
Congress in support of his amendment. His words still resonate. In 1968,
addressing a committee of Democrats in Indiana, Bayh urged fellow
Democrats to support his proposal.

"We are living in a dangerous world where the stability of the United
States of America is one of the most important things facing us," he
said. "[When we have an [Electoral College]{.mark} system which
threatens to elect a man who has fewer votes than his opponent, we tend
[to **erode the confidence in the people of this country**]{.mark} **and
their president and in their form of government.**]{.underline}"

James Michener, an author who served as a presidential elector in 1968,
was even blunter. The Electoral College, he wrote, was a "time bomb
lodged near the heart of the nation."

It still is.

[[The Electoral College was]{.mark} a [dumb]{.mark} idea when it was
first proposed. Today, it\'s the Constitution\'s most egregious affront
to elementary fairness. In a just and properly functioning political
system, it would be eliminated without delay or regret.]{.underline}

[Why do we have the Electoral College in the first place? If we
begin]{.underline} at the beginning [and look for guidance to Alexander
Hamilton]{.underline} --- the presumed author of Federalist Paper No.
68, which discusses and defends the Electoral College --- [we discover
what sounds like the musings of a dorm room full of mildly drunken
undergraduates seeking to apply to the world the overly pious lessons of
an \"Intro to Political Theory\" course]{.underline}.

[Wouldn\'t it be nice if voters didn\'t cast ballots in favor of the
president directly but instead voted for a group of people of
\"information and discernment\" who would themselves make the final
choice]{.underline} of who will stand at the head of the executive
branch of government and serve as the commander in chief of the armed
forces[? [The idea]{.mark}, apparently, [was]{.mark} that [there should
be an extra layer of distance between the people and the choice of
president]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and that this layer should consist of
a group of citizens (electors) who freely deliberate about the choice,
like a temporary Congress filled with people who don\'t serve in other
elective offices, with the outcome of those deliberations treated as
legitimate by the people even when it countermands the result of the
popular vote.

**[How Hamilton or anyone else with a knowledge of political history
could have considered this a workable idea is beyond me]{.underline}**.

But don\'t take my word for it. W[e know the idea is ridiculous because
[the institution **has never functioned in any way like
this**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Yes, [there have been a handful of
elections]{.underline}, including two within the last two decades, [in
which the winner of the electoral vote has won the presidency despite
losing the popular vote]{.underline}. But [that **isn\'t because the
electors pondered the results of the popular vote, deliberated about it,
and then overruled it.**]{.underline}

In fact, [during the Trump transition]{.underline} of 2016-2017 [a small
number of anti-Trump scholars and citizens tried and failed to persuade
electors to act this way, switching their votes away from]{.underline}
the electoral vote winner ([Trump]{.underline}) to some other person,
either the winner of the popular vote (Hillary Clinton --- who just
argued in The Atlantic that it\'s time to kill the Electoral College) or
a different Republican --- really to anyone other than the singularly
unfit man at the head of the GOP ticket.

[That didn\'t happen, or come remotely close to happening]{.underline},
because [it\'s a recipe for an outcome that **would**]{.underline}
understandably **[be viewed as democratically
illegitimate]{.underline}**, with ordinary citizens wondering just who
the hell these electors think they are to meddle with and overturn the
outcome of an election.

In practical terms, then, [the actual [people who serve as electors are
irrelevant]{.mark}, [as is their capacity for
deliberation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The electors nearly always vote the
way their state voted in the popular election. The process is automatic,
rendering the formality of an actual meeting to cast ballots beside the
point. Which means that [[what matters is **not who votes** but **how
many electoral votes**]{.mark} **a state is
[allocated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That is determined by adding together
a state\'s congressional and senatorial delegations.

[**And [that\'s where the problem lies]{.mark}** --- because [there is a
significant]{.mark} representational [imbalance between heavily and
sparsely populated states]{.mark}.]{.underline}

At this point, we run into a classic debate in American politics ---
about federalism, population density, large states versus small states,
and the cultural character of rural versus urban and suburban areas of
the country.

[[Is the U.S. a single nation]{.mark} with a single
population]{.underline} of citizens? [[Or is it a conglomeration
of]{.mark} 50 [mini-nations]{.mark} with 50 distinct bodies of citizens
bound together into a unit that is and should remain less than the sum
of its roughly equal parts?]{.underline} [[The Articles of
Confederation]{.mark} that preceded the]{.underline} federal
[Constitution [sided]{.mark}]{.underline} strongly [[with the
latter]{.mark}. The]{.underline} U.S. [Constitution]{.underline} written
in 1787 [attempted to strike a balance between the two
extremes]{.underline}, with the Federalist faction (led by Hamilton and
James Madison) leaning in the direction a single nation and the
anti-Federalists favoring a more state-centered arrangement.
(Progressives have tended to lean much less unambivalently in the
direction of viewing the country as a single nation in which the power
and distinctiveness of individual states is minimized.)

The need to get anti-Federalist (and Southern slaveholding) buy-in for
ratification of the Constitution led to a number of the founding
document\'s most distinctive features. One was the Bill of Rights.
Another was the upper chamber of Congress, which gives two senators to
every state, regardless of population. This meant that the least heavily
populated state at the time of ratification (Delaware, with 59,000
people) had the same representation in the Senate as the most heavily
populated state (Virginia, with 747,000 people), despite the latter
having nearly 13 times the population as the former.

That\'s a lot of extra power for small states. But it\'s nowhere near
the boost they enjoy today, when the most populated state (very
Democratic California) is 68 times as heavily populated as the least
populated state (very Republican Wyoming). It\'s this dynamic that is
producing a situation in which, just over two decades from now,
one-third of Americans could be represented by 70 percent of the Senate.

Let\'s assume this makes sense --- because states should be considered
roughly equal political entities regardless of population, and because
the more rural, low-density populations of small states possess certain
qualities (like civic virtue?) that deserve to receive outsized
influence on our political system. I don\'t buy either claim and rather
doubt that most people who live in larger states would either. [[But
let\'s suppose]{.underline}]{.mark}, for the sake of argument, that
it\'s persuasive --- that [for the good of the country [small states
should be]{.mark}]{.underline} vastly
[[overrepresented]{.underline}]{.mark} in the upper chamber of Congress.

But then [[how do we explain the Electoral College]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[which]{.mark} builds off of this imbalance and [applies it to how we
choose the head of the executive branch]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and
through the president\'s appointment powers the judicial branch as well?

Consider the difference between voting for president in California and
Wyoming.

In 2016, roughly 14 million people voted for president in California
compared to 255,000 people in Wyoming. Clinton\'s California win gave
her 55 electoral votes, while Trump walked away from Wyoming with three.
That might sound like a big advantage for the Democrat, but when the
electoral result is compared to the relative size of each state\'s
population it\'s the opposite. In fact, an individual voting for
president in Wyoming in 2016 had three times the influence on the
Electoral College as an individual voting in California.

So let\'s summarize: [[The Senate]{.mark} hugely [amplifies the power of
small states]{.mark}]{.underline}. (This comes [[on top
of]{.mark}]{.underline} Republican [[gerrymandering]{.underline}]{.mark}
of House districts, which does the same for rural areas within
Republican-controlled states.) [[The Electoral College then does the
same thing]{.mark} when it comes to choosing the
presidency]{.underline}, and [with incredibly significant
consequences]{.underline} --- [giving us]{.underline} George W.
[Bush]{.underline} instead of Al Gore [and]{.underline} Donald [Trump
instead of]{.underline} Hillary [Clinton]{.underline}, not to mention
Neil Gorsuch instead of Merrick Garland.

[That\'s [all three branches of the federal government **operating
to**]{.mark} **systematically [hand more political power to fewer
people]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If this happened in one branch of the
federal government, perhaps it could be justified. But across them all?
That\'s grossly unfair, as growing numbers of Americans are coming to
recognize.

### 2NC -- Gerrymandering

#### The epistemology that justifies the redrawing of borders to serve one's own desires also justifies actions which lead to further erosion of democracy

**[Beauchamp 6/27]{.underline}** \[Zack Beauchamp, senior correspondent
at Vox, where he covers global politics and ideology, 6-27-2019, \"The
Supreme Court's gerrymandering decision reveals a profound threat to
democracy,\" Vox, accessed 7-24-2019,

\]

The Supreme Court's Thursday morning ruling in Rucho v. Common Cause
amounts to a blank check for partisan gerrymandering. [Chief Justice
John Roberts's opinion holds that federal courts should not have the
power to declare particular maps unconstitutional, as doing so would be
"unprecedented expansion of judicial power \... into one of the most
intensely partisan aspects of American political life."]{.underline}

What this means, in practice, is that [[local authorities get to
decide]{.mark} on [the shape of]{.mark} House and state [legislative
districts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Parties that control statehouses will be
freer to not only cement their own hold on power but ensure that their
party sends more representatives to Washington as well.

While Republicans and Democrats both gerrymander, there is no doubt that
Republicans do it more and more shamelessly. North Carolina Rep. David
[[Lewis]{.underline}]{.mark}, who helped draw one of the maps at issue
in Rucho, [[was]{.mark} admirably [honest about his
motives]{.mark}]{.underline} in a 2016 statehouse speech.

**["I think [electing Republicans is better than electing
Democrats]{.mark}," he explained. "[So I drew this map in a way
to]{.mark} help [foster what I think is better for the
country]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

[[This principle]{.underline}]{.mark} --- that Republicans believe their
rule is better and are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure they
take and hold power --- [[does not merely lead to
gerrymandering]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It has produced [a whole host of
undemocratic actions]{.mark}]{.underline}, at both state and federal
levels, [[that amount to a]{.mark} **systematic [threat to]{.mark}
American [democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, some of the best
scholarship we have on American democracy suggests that this is even
more alarming than it sounds; that [it fits historical patterns of
[democratic backsliding]{.mark}]{.underline} both in the United States
and abroad.

In her dissent to Roberts's ruling, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that
"[[gerrymanders]{.mark} like the ones here [may irreparably
damage]{.mark} our system of [government]{.mark}." [I'd take it **a step
further**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Court's ruling in Rucho reveals that there's a threat to American
democracy more subtle and yet greater than the Trump presidency: the
Republican Party's drift toward being institutionally hostile to
democracy.

The Court's ruling permits a systematic attack on democracy

[Partisan [gerrymandering is]{.mark}]{.underline}, on its face, [an
[obviously anti-democratic]{.mark} practice]{.underline}. State
legislators pack large numbers of voters from the opposing party into a
handful of legislative districts, thus ensuring their voters dominate
the bulk of districts and hand them a majority. It gives their
supporters' votes more weight, a direct violation of the core democratic
principles relating to equal citizenship and representation.

Historically, both parties have engaged in partisan gerrymandering:
Rucho itself concerned both the Republican map in North Carolina and a
Democratic map in Maryland. [But [the GOP has embraced]{.mark} the
fashion [in a far more]{.mark} systematic and [troubling
fashion]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In 2010, [Republican strategist Karl Rove wrote]{.underline} an op-ed in
the Wall Street Journal [advocating a significant Republican push to
gerrymander legislative districts after that year's midterm
elections]{.underline}. Rove's idea manifested as Project REDMAP, a
dark-money campaign to support Republican candidates for state
legislature and then help them redraw House districts after the 2010
census.

[[We]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[saw the results]{.underline}]{.mark}
of this process in 2012, when [[Republicans held]{.mark} the [House
despite more Americans voting for Democratic]{.mark} House [candidates
than Republican ones]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**The consequences
persist**, making it significantly harder for Democrats to win office in
places around the country.]{.underline}

In the 2018 election, [[Republicans won]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[50
percent of]{.mark} the]{.underline} US [[House vote]{.mark} in North
Carolina]{.underline}. [That [translated into 70 percent of House
seats]{.mark}]{.underline} due to heavily gerrymandered districts.
[Wisconsin Democrats won every statewide election]{.underline} in 2018
[but did not win majorities in either chamber]{.underline} of the state
legislature. Once again, **[[gerrymanders are to
blame]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The Rucho ruling allows Republicans to continue this campaign and even
escalate it, as they don't have to worry about outrageous maps getting
rolled back by federal courts. "John Roberts \... gave the Republicans a
green light to gerrymander to their hearts content," UC Irvine election
law expert Rick Hasen writes at Slate.

The national Republican campaign to cement their control over state
legislatures and congressional delegations is not only harder to fight
back but could very well get worse.

#### Gerrymandering allows for hardline laws not supported by voters to be pushed through

bestseller "Ratf\*\*ked: Why Your Vote Doesn't Count" and a senior

\]

Fifty-four thousand votes out of nearly 4 million. That's what separated
Stacey Abrams from Brian Kemp in Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial election,
a sign of how closely contested this once reliably red, southern state
has become.

Earlier this month, however, [Georgia's legislature responded to the
state's closely divided political climate]{.underline} not with
thoughtful compromise but [by passing **one of the most restrictive
abortion bans**]{.underline} in the United States.

An April poll by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that 70% of
Georgians support the landmark Roe v Wade decision that legalized
abortion. The new state ban is opposed by 48% of Georgians and supported
by only 43%. So [[why would the legislature enact such an extreme
measure]{.mark}?]{.underline}

For that matter, why would Ohio, Alabama, Missouri and other states
establish similar "fetal heartbeat" laws that are far more restrictive
than their constituents support?

[One important answer is [gerrymandering]{.mark}: redistricting voting
districts to give the party in power an edge -- [making it almost
impossible for the other side to win a majority]{.mark}]{.underline} of
seats, even with a majority of votes. Sophisticated geo-mapping software
and voluminous voter data turned this ancient art into a hi-tech science
when the US redistricted after the 2010 census.

[[Republicans recognized]{.mark} the [opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s snoozed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nine years later,
**[they're still paying the price]{.mark}**, particularly in swing state
legislatures.]{.underline} A little-known group called the Republican
State Leadership Committee (RSLC) launched a devastatingly effective
strategy called Redmap -- short for the Redistricting Majority Project.
It dropped \$30m of dark money into sleepy local races, flipped
legislative chambers blue to red, and gave the Republicans control over
drawing the vast majority of local legislative and US House seats -- and
with it, the power to remake the political playing field for the next
decade.

[[Republicans]{.mark} took such advantage]{.underline} that [they [have
controlled state]{.mark} legislative [supermajorities in otherwise
competitive states]{.mark} even when voters prefer Democratic candidates
by hundreds of thousands of votes]{.underline}. This nullifies elections
and insulates lawmakers from a majority that seeks to vote them out of
office.

[Despite lacking any mandate for an extreme agenda in a closely divided
nation, **Republican lawmakers have pushed through new voting
restrictions, anti-labor laws, the emergency manager bill that led to
poisoned water in Flint, Michigan, and now, these strict abortion
bans**. Electorally, **[there's little that Democrats can do]{.mark}**
to stop it.]{.underline}

Just [take a look at Georgia]{.underline}, where [the]{.underline}
ultra-[competitive contest between Kemp and Abrams made national
headlines and propelled the highest midterm voter turnout in the state's
modern history]{.underline}. But [while that race was decided by just a
handful of votes]{.underline}, [it was]{.underline} a [completely
different]{.underline} story [in the down-ballot elections for the
state's house and senate]{.underline}. [Those districts were drawn to be
so non-competitive]{.underline} that [112 of]{.underline} the state's
[180 house districts]{.underline} -- [and 33 of]{.underline} the
[56]{.underline} state [senate elections]{.underline} -- [featured no
major-party challenger. **[Voters]{.mark} literally [had no
choice]{.mark} at all.**]{.underline}

[Or travel to Ohio]{.underline}, the long-time midwestern bellwether.
[There's]{.underline} also [zero evidence]{.underline} that [voters here
have extreme opinions on abortion]{.underline}. [Polls show]{.underline}
that more [voters are against the]{.underline} new "heartbeat"
[bill]{.underline} than for it, and Ohioans are clearly comfortable
splitting their ballots in statewide races. In 2018, [the state
re-elected a pro-choice Democratic senator and an anti-abortion
Republican governor]{.underline}. They divided their vote for the
state's house and senate about as equally as possible: **[Republicans
won 50.3% statewide]{.underline}**.

But thanks to what a University of Chicago study called an "uncommonly
severe gerrymander", [barely half the votes provided Republicans more
than 63% of the seats]{.underline}. Once again, [there's little that
Democrats can do]{.underline}, simply because the maps were surgically
designed to create so few competitive seats. In 2018, only six of 99
house elections finished within five percentage points. Democrats could
have won them all and still finished far short of control.

In Alabama, meanwhile, a determined racial gerrymander packed black
Democrats into as few seats as possible and diluted the African American
vote. That legislature, seated after a sleazy money-laundering effort
uncovered by the RSLC's own attorneys, has passed the strictest abortion
ban in the nation, one that polls show is too conservative even for
Alabama. A recent survey found that only 31% of Alabama voters backed
abortion limits like this one, which provides no exception for rape or
incest.

[[Voters are silenced at the ballot box, and]{.mark} then can be safely
[ignored by their legislatures]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is what happens when so many races are non-competitive. It means
that the only action takes place in party primaries. They tend to be
low-turnout elections that favor the most passionate partisans. That has
three key effects: it sends more extreme members of both parties to
state capitals, incentivizes them to fear compromise or anything that
might earn a primary challenge, and it insulates them from voters almost
no matter what they do. Voters are silenced at the ballot box, and then
can be safely ignored by their legislatures.

What, if anything, can voters do? It won't be easy. Last November,
citizens in four states -- including Missouri, home to yet another
radical new abortion ban -- passed ballot initiatives or constitutional
amendments that shifted mapmaking powers away from self-interested
partisans and toward independent commissions. In Missouri and Michigan,
however, despite more than 60% of voters demanding an end to politicians
choosing their own voters, these gerrymandered legislatures have taken
steps to undermine the new initiatives. Several other states this year
have made it significantly harder to put initiatives on the ballot.

Four federal courts, meanwhile, have overturned entire statewide maps as
unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. The US supreme court, long
reluctant to get involved in this political thicket, is expected to
issue rulings in cases from Maryland and North Carolina in June. Whether
or not the court takes action, it could take a generation to wash away
the anti-majoritarian toxins that this decade's partisan gerrymanders
intentionally injected into our hijacked politics. Just as frightening:
the 2021 redistricting cycle is just two years away.

#### Gerrymandering is [bad]{.underline} -- plethora of reasons

**[Prokop 16]{.underline}** \[Andrew Prokop, Senior Politics

worst, explained,\" Vox, accessed 7-24-2019,

\]

3\) That seems unfair.

Well, [[there's a lot]{.mark} that's unfair --- **or at the very least
[undemocratic]{.mark}** --- [about the Electoral
College]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For one, [[the winner of the]{.mark} nationwide [popular vote **can lose
the presidency**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2000, Al Gore won half a
million more votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the
presidency after he was declared the winner in Florida by a mere 537
votes. And that wasn't the first time --- electoral college/popular vote
splits happened in 1876 and 1888 too, and occurred in 2016 too.

Second, [[there's **swing state privilege**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Millions of votes]{.mark} in safe states [end up]{.mark} being
"[wasted]{.mark}]{.underline}," at least in terms of the presidential
race, because [it makes no difference whether Clinton wins California by
4 million votes, 400,000 votes, or 40 votes]{.underline} --- in any
scenario, [she gets its 55 electors]{.underline}. Meanwhile, states like
Florida and Ohio get the power to tip the outcome just because they
happen to be closely divided politically.

Third, [a small **[state bias is also built in]{.mark}**, since every
state is guaranteed at least three electors]{.underline} (the
combination of their representation in the House and Senate). The way
this shakes out in the math, [the 4 percent of the country's population
in the smallest states end up being allotted 8 percent of Electoral
College votes]{.underline}.

And fourth, [[there's the possibility for]{.mark} those
**[electors]{.mark} themselves [to hijack the
outcome]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

4\) Wait, the electors can hijack the outcome of the presidential
election? What?

For decades, it's been assumed that the 538 electors will essentially
rubber-stamp the outcome in their respective states, and they mostly
have. But there's scarily little assurance that they'll actually do so.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, about [30 of
the 50 states have passed laws \"binding\" their electors to vote in
accordance with the presidential popular vote]{.underline} in their
state. But in most, the penalty for not doing so is only a fine, and
it's unclear whether stiffer penalties would hold up in court --- it's
never been tested, and the Constitution does appear to give the electors
the right to make the final call. Furthermore, there are still 20 or so
states that haven't even tried to bind their electors.

This hasn't mattered much in the past because, almost always, the
parties do a good enough job of vetting their respective electoral
slates to ensure that they will indeed loyally back their party's
presidential nominee.

But [[there have been a few **rogue, faithless,
or**]{.underline}]{.mark} just plain [[**incompetent electors** over the
years]{.mark} --- and their votes have all been counted as
cast.]{.underline}

In 1837, rogue electors from Virginia briefly blocked the seating of the
vice president-elect because they were offended that he had a mixed-race
common-law wife. (The Senate overrode them.)

A Democratic elector from Tennessee cast his ballot for segregationist
third-party candidate Strom Thurmond in 1948, and a Republican elector
from North Carolina voted for segregationist third-party candidate
George Wallace in 1968.

In 2000, an elector from Washington, DC, withheld an electoral vote from
Al Gore, because she wanted to protest the fact that DC didn't have
representation in Congress.

Perhaps most bizarrely of all, in 2004, an elector from Minnesota who
was supposed to vote for John Kerry for president instead voted for John
Edwards. (It's believed that this was an accident, but since the votes
were cast anonymously, we don't really know for sure. Great system!)

And this year, one Democratic elector candidate from Washington state
has repeatedly said that he will "absolutely not" cast his ballot for
Hillary Clinton if she wins his state. We'll see whether he follows
through.

[Rogue electors have never been [numerous enough to actually affect the
outcome]{.mark}]{.underline} of a presidential race. But it really
doesn't look like there's much stopping them should they choose to do
so.

Now, some defenders of the system, like Georgetown professor Jason
Brennan, take the comforting view that the power of electors to go rogue
is a good thing, since they could conceivably save America from a
popularly elected majoritarian candidate who could oppress the minority.

But [it seems just as likely]{.underline}, if not more likely, that
[electors could install that candidate with dictatorial tendencies
against that popular will]{.underline}. Perhaps some electors are wise
sages with better judgment than the American people, but others are
likely malign, corrupt, or driven by their own idiosyncratic beliefs.
(You'll notice above that several of those historical rogue electors in
history had racist motivations.)

In any case, if we had a process in which the electors were notable
citizens who were chosen because they're supposed to exercise good
judgment, maybe Brennan's defense would make sense. But in the system we
have today, the electors are chosen to be rubber stamps. As a result,
there's incredibly little attention paid to who those electors even are
outside internal party machinations in each state. Any defection by an
elector would, essentially, be a random act that could that could hold
our system hostage.

### 2AC -- AT: Electoral College

#### The electoral college is good -- it incentivizes parties to strategize

**[Douthat 3/23]{.underline}** \[Ross Douthat, Opinion columnist for The
Times, 3-23-2019, \"A Case for the Electoral College,\" The New York
Times, accessed 7-25-2019,
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/opinion/electoral-college.html?module=inline
\]

[[Debates about the Electoral College]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the one
that Democrats have lately instigated, [often [get bogged down in
disputes about]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[intentions]{.mark} of the
founding generation]{.underline} --- whether they were trying to check
mob rule, prop up Southern power, preserve the power of small states, or
simply come to a necessarily arbitrary constitutional compromise.

[[These]{.mark} disputes [are]{.mark} historically interesting
but]{.underline} somewhat practically [[irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark},
because [everyone agrees that the college doesn't work the way the
founders expected]{.underline}. It doesn't allow wise electors to veto
demagogic candidates, it doesn't throw most presidential elections to
the House of Representatives --- and as my colleague Nate Cohn pointed
out last week, it doesn't always give extra influence to the smallest
states. (Donald Trump won because he overperformed in big swing states,
not because he cobbled together a coalition of small ones.)

Instead [[the Electoral College]{.underline}]{.mark} really just [[does
one]{.mark} big [thing]{.mark} that a [popular-vote]{.mark} system
[wouldn't do]{.mark}: [It makes it possible for close elections to
**yield a president supported by a minority**]{.mark} **of voters,
[especially]{.mark} in circumstances [where]{.mark} that minority is
regionally [concentrated rather than diffuse]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Is there a case for [[a system that sometimes produces undemocratic
outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}? I think so, on two grounds. First, it
[[**creates incentives**]{.mark} for political parties and candidates
**[to seek supermajorities rather than just]{.mark}** playing for
**[50.1 percent]{.mark}**]{.underline}, because the latter play is a
losing one more often than in a popular-vote presidential system.

Second, [[it creates incentives]{.mark} for political parties [to **try
to break regional blocs**]{.mark} controlled by the opposition,
**[rather than just maximizing turnout in]{.mark} their [own
areas]{.mark}**]{.underline}, because you win the presidency
consistently only as a party of multiple regions and you can crack a
rival party's narrow majority by flipping a few states.

According to this --- admittedly contrarian --- theory, the fact that
the Electoral College produces chaotic or undemocratic outcomes in
moments of ideological or regional polarization is actually a helpful
thing, insofar as it drives politicians and political hacks (by nature
not the most creative types) to think bigger than regional blocs and 51
percent majorities.

Thus the electoral/popular split of 1888 pointed the way to William
McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt's national Republican majorities, and the
near-splits of 1968 and 1976 pushed us toward Reagan's nationwide
landslides and Bill Clinton's successful center-left campaigns. Time and
again a close election leads to hand-wringing about the need for
Electoral College reform; time and again, politicians and parties
respond to the college's incentives, and more capacious and unifying
majorities are born.

Does this theory fit our current situation? In a sense, yes. Donald
[Trump could win the presidency without a popular-vote majority only
because both parties have been locked into base-turnout strategies that
are partially responsible for our government's ineffectiveness and
gridlock]{.underline}. [And to the extent]{.underline} that Hillary
[Clinton's campaign leaned into this]{.underline} polarization (writing
off many constituencies that her husband competed for), [she deserved
her electoral-college loss]{.underline}.

[Trump could also only win the presidency without a popular-vote
majority because a large region of the country, the greater Rust Belt
and Appalachia, had been neglected by both parties' policies over the
preceding decades]{.underline}, leading to a slow-building social crisis
that the national press only really noticed because of Trump's political
success. In this sense, Clinton's weird post-election boast that her
half of the country was way more economically dynamic indicated the
advantages of a system where a declining region can punch above its
popular-vote weight --- because it makes it harder for a party
associated with economic winners to simply write the losers off.

#### Disregard [all]{.underline} neg electoral college evidence -- Dems only want it gone to win

**[Davies and Harrigan 3/28]{.underline}** \[Antony Davies, associate
professor of economics at Duquesne University, and James R. Harrigan,

\]

[Nearly every element of the U.S. Constitution is a
compromise]{.underline} resulting from long and often contentious
arguments. [[There was one thing]{.mark}, though, upon which nearly [all
parties agreed: the Electoral College]{.mark}]{.underline}. Alexander
Hamilton spoke to this in Federalist 68, writing that the appointment of
the President "is almost the only part of the system, of any
consequence, which has escaped without severe censure, or which has
received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents."

The major point of contention at the time was the construction of
Congress. Citizens from more populous states favored representation
based on population. Citizens from less populous states wanted
representation based on statehood. What emerged, the Great Compromise,
combined both methods. Legislative power would be shared by a House of
Representatives, based on the former, and a Senate, based on the latter.

[The Electoral College [raised no eyebrows because it
was]{.mark}]{.underline} simply [[grafted to the Great
Compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}. Each state would receive a number of
electoral votes equal to the number of the state's representatives and
senators. Today, these range from a high of 55 for California to a low
of three for each of the seven least populous states.

So how did we get to the point where Democratic politicians, most
recently Elizabeth Warren, are calling for dismantling the only thing on
which virtually all the Founders agreed? The answer is simple:
**[[Democrats believe they would]{.mark} have a better chance of
[win]{.mark}ning [without it]{.mark}. [Expediency explains why
politicians do]{.mark} just about [everything they
do]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But for the nation, the important question is
not about who might win with or without the Electoral College.
[[The]{.mark} important [question is whether, in principle, the
Electoral College is]{.mark} still [a good idea]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**[It is]{.mark}**. The Electoral College is a good idea because [there
is more to representation than raw population]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Population is important, **but [so]{.mark}**]{.underline}, too, **[[is
geography]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

As was the case when the Constitution was framed, rural and urban voters
today have decidedly different interests. The Electoral College
considers both. More than 80 percent of the Electoral College's votes
are based on state populations, with the remainder based on geography.
Because Democrats do well in urban areas, if geography no longer
mattered, they would never again need to campaign in nor care about the
country's sparsely populated areas.

This is no guarantee of electoral victory, though. If geography didn't
matter, Republican campaign strategies would change also. Whereas
Republicans have long written off states like California under a popular
vote model, Republicans would gain an incentive to campaign there. How
all of this would affect the popular vote is anyone's guess. What would
happen to the attention paid to vast swaths of the country, however, is
not. That attention would disappear.

But [[the move to scuttle]{.mark} the Electoral College [is not about
principle. It's about winning]{.mark}. How do we know]{.underline}?
Because [[Democrats could achieve almost the same outcome]{.mark} as a
popular vote without touching the Electoral College]{.underline}. Under
the Constitution, each state has the power to decide for itself how to
assign its electoral votes. Democrats control the legislatures in 18
states. They could propose tomorrow that those states' electoral votes
be allocated proportionally according to the states' popular votes. Two
states, Nebraska and Maine, already do something like this.

But Democrats won't propose this. If they did, solidly Democratic states
like California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey, would end up
allocating some of their electoral votes to Republican candidates. This
reveals the real motivation behind the push to eliminate the Electoral
College: [Democrats want to dictate to Republican states how those
states assign their electoral votes]{.underline}.

[While [the current push]{.mark} to disband the Electoral College [comes
from]{.mark} a host of [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}, the
[Republicans]{.mark} [would do]{.mark} **precisely [the same]{.mark}
thing** [were the situation reversed]{.mark}. How do we know? They care
about winning exactly as much as their Democratic
counterparts.]{.underline}

This lack of principle is reason enough not to take either party all
that seriously. An even better reason is that the nature of
representation itself is on the line. The Framers gave us a Constitution
in which both population and geography mattered. Until there is a
principled reason to shift away from this, we shouldn't. And wanting
your preferred party to win is not a principled reason.

#### Even if abolishing solves, it's deeply unpopular as long as Trump is in office -- still links to politics

**[Vasilogambros 4/19]{.underline}** \[Matt Vasilogambros, writer,

States,\" No Publication, accessed 7-24-2019,
https://www.governing.com/topics/politics/sl-trump-alters-electoral-college-debate.html
\]

[[For years]{.underline}]{.mark}, polls show,
[[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} across the country [[championed a
national popular vote]{.mark} to elect presidents]{.underline},
[[instead of the]{.underline}]{.mark} state-by-state tally of the
[[Electoral College]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[But something changed]{.mark}:]{.underline} Donald [**[Trump got
elected]{.mark}**]{.underline} president.

Trump won the Electoral College handily in 2016 but lost the popular
vote to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million
ballots. As of last year, only 32% of GOP voters supported a national
popular vote, down from 54% in 2011, according to the Pew Research
Center. Three-quarters of Democrats, meanwhile, supported a national
popular vote. (The Pew Charitable Trusts funds both the Pew Research
Center and Stateline.)

[[The Republican shift has altered the trajectory of]{.mark} state
[legislative efforts to change the]{.mark} federal
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}. State legislatures have the constitutional
right to choose the method by which electoral votes are distributed, and
more than a dozen support a way to work around the Electoral College in
presidential contests.

Those behind the push for change want states to sign on to the National
Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an agreement in which states would
assign their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who gets the
most voters across the entire country.

So far, with strong support from Democratic lawmakers and governors, 14
states and the District of Columbia have joined the compact, accounting
for 181 electoral votes. The compact would go into effect once member
states account for the 270 electoral votes needed to elect a president.
To reach that goal, the compact is going to need Republican support.

[[Republican opinion]{.mark} surrounding the Electoral College, however,
[followed a similar path to Trump's own opinion]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[In 2012, he tweeted, "The electoral college is a disaster for a
democracy]{.underline}."

Shortly [after his victory]{.underline} in 2016, [he changed his
tune]{.underline}, tweeting, "[The Electoral College is actually genius
in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into
play]{.underline}."

Today, [there is bitter debate over the founding fathers'
intent]{.underline} when they created the Electoral College. [Some think
the Electoral College, by propping up smaller states, is working as it
was originally intended.]{.underline}

Some supporters also note that the system empowers presidents who win a
plurality, but not a majority, of the popular vote. In 1912 and 1992,
third-party candidates held Democrats Woodrow Wilson and Bill Clinton to
41.8 and 43% of the popular vote, respectively.

But Wilson won 81.9% of the electoral vote and Clinton won 68.7%,
allowing both to govern from a position of strength.

But some constitutional scholars say the Electoral College of today is
far from what was imagined more than 200 years ago.

Andrew Shankman, a professor of history at Rutgers University-Camden,
said the Electoral College was designed to give a small group of men ---
the electors from each state --- the power to choose the president,
instead of giving the power to the public. Before the ratification of
the 12th Amendment in 1804, the presidential runner-up became the vice
president.

The Electoral College changed over time, Shankman said, becoming more
chaotic and dysfunctional with the rise of political parties and the
growth of the nation.

"There's nothing sacrosanct about the Electoral College," he said. "The
very idea of it is increasingly not compatible in American politics."

Debate within the Republican Party, meanwhile, has not stopped. [Many
[state lawmakers and former party officials]{.mark}]{.underline},
determined to change the way presidents are elected, [[are **struggling
to convince** ]{.mark}**their [colleagues]{.mark}** [not to
abandon]{.mark} the movement.]{.underline}

"Republicans ... think it's a communist plot to make Al Gore and Hillary
Clinton president," said Saul Anuzis, who served as the chairman of the
Michigan Republican Party from 2005 to 2009. "This is a federalist,
states' rights approach."

Anuzis is now a senior adviser for National Popular Vote, a nonprofit
based in California that advocates for the interstate compact. He's been
lobbying Republican state lawmakers on a new system, touting the support
of eight former chairs of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a
conservative nonprofit that focuses on state legislative efforts. He
also has the backing of former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich.

National Popular Vote spent \$182,000 in the 2018 midterms on federal
elections, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

But [[getting more than a handful of Republican state legislators to
sign on]{.mark} to the agreement in the past two years [has been a
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}. This year, measures that passed in [New
Mexico and Colorado]{.underline} in March [had not a single Republican
backer]{.underline}.

In Delaware, which also signed on to the compact last month, just two
Republican state senators supported the measure. One of them, Anthony
Delcollo, recognizes the Trump effect.

"Sometimes folks get really passionate about things and, in this case,
there was definitely a knee-jerk reaction that some had against this
idea," Delcollo said in an interview. "It's much harder to convince
someone who's had that reaction to be open-minded."

The current system "is bad for our nation," Delcollo said, since swing
states are the only ones deciding presidential elections. He said he
hopes other Republicans will join in trying to fix it.

In Oregon, when a measure passed the state Senate in April, just two
Republicans supported it. The measure now heads to the state House,
where it's expected to pass. The state House has passed the measure
several times in the past decade, but Democratic Senate President Peter
Courtney blocked the bills in his chamber.

In Nevada, where Democrats control both houses in the legislature and
the governorship, a bill to adopt the national popular vote has a chance
of passing this session. In April, it passed the Assembly without
Republican support, and is now heading to the state Senate.

Since state legislatures control how electoral votes are distributed in
states, a state could in theory leave the national compact if its
lawmakers passed a new law.

#### Overhauling the electoral college is unpopular -- means it still links to politics

**[Parks 3/22]{.underline}** \[Miles Parks, 3-22-2019, \"Abolishing The

\]

[Fully [overhauling the way the president is selected would take
a]{.mark} Constitutional [amendment]{.mark}]{.underline}, which would
require the votes of two-thirds of the U.S. House of Representatives,
two-thirds of the Senate, and three-fourths of the states.

[[Support of that magnitude has become **rare for anything**]{.mark} in
a sharply divided United States]{.underline}. An amendment hasn\'t been
adopted since the 27th, in 1992, and one hasn\'t been adopted relatively
quickly since the 26th, which took 100 days from proposal to adoption in
1971.

President [[Trump once supported abolishing the Electoral
College]{.underline}]{.mark} --- he previously felt it was a \"total
disaster for democracy\" --- [[but]{.mark} since his 2016]{.underline}
presidential [victory]{.underline} over Hillary Clinton, in which
Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, but Trump
received 304 electoral votes, [[he has changed his
mind]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Now, [Trump feels [the Electoral College is \"far better for the
U.S.A.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} as he wrote Tuesday on Twitter.

[[That position, shared by many Republicans, makes it **highly
unlikely**]{.mark} that [there would be sufficient support for
chang]{.mark}ing the system.]{.underline}

\"There\'s no realistic chance of a Constitutional amendment to abolish
the Electoral College,\" said Jacob Levy, a professor of political
theory at McGill University.

### 2AC -- AT: Gerrymandering

#### Gerrymandering isn't destroying democracy -- the voters do it themselves

**[Bump 13]{.underline}** \[Philip Bump, former politics writer for The
Atlantic Wire, 7-29-2013, \"No, Gerrymandering Is Not Destroying
Democracy,\" Atlantic, accessed 7-24-2019,
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/07/no-gerrymandering-not-destroying-democracy/312772/
\]

The point being: [[Even before five decades of gerrymandered]{.mark}
congressional [districts]{.mark}, congressional [races weren\'t as close
as Cook might suggest]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In addition to gerrymandered districts, [[the Journal **cites a
rationale for the declining number of close
races**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Another factor in the declining number of competitive districts is that
[[voters are dividing themselves]{.mark} geographically [more than they
did]{.mark} 10 or 20 years ago, political observers say]{.underline}.
[[Americans]{.mark} are now more likely to [live in communities
**where**]{.mark} **their [neighbors share their political
views]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That steady, decades-long shift produces
more-partisan congressional seats.

That is mirrored by a study completed after last year\'s election, by
Eric McGhee of The Monkey Cage. After the election, a common complaint
among Democrats, echoing Nolan\'s, was that Democrats won a majority of
votes but a minority of seats. Which is true: 48.7 percent of the
national House vote was Democratic, versus 47.6 for Republicans.

So McGhee modeled the 2012 race [[using the previous Congress\'
districts]{.underline}]{.mark}. (Redistricting generally occurs after
each Census, so 2012 used new boundaries nationally.)

[[Democrats]{.mark} **do [gain more seats]{.mark}**]{.underline} under
this simulation---seven more total---**[[but fall far short of
matching]{.mark} their [predicted vote share]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
point should be clear: [even under the most generous assumptions,
[**redistricting** **explains less than half the gap**]{.mark} between
vote share and seat share this election cycle]{.underline}.

McGhee suggested that [[Democrats fare worse]{.mark} in part [because of
geography]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"Democrats also do worse because [[they
are more concentrated in urban areas]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he wrote.
\"[They \'waste\' votes on huge margins]{.underline} there, when the
party could put many of those votes to better use in marginal seats.\"
In other words, Democrats move to cities and overwhelmingly vote for
Democrats. [If Democrats want to re-take the House, they should move to
Wyoming]{.underline}.

#### Gerrymandering can be used for good -- makes sure minorities are represented

**[Druke 17]{.underline}** \[Galen Druke, FiveThirtyEight's podcast
producer and reporter, 12-14-2017, \"Is Gerrymandering The Best Way To
Make Sure Black Voters Are Represented?,\" FiveThirtyEight, accessed
7-24-2019,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-gerrymandering-the-best-way-to-make-sure-black-voters-are-represented/
\]

At first glance, [[few things scream "gerrymander" like
splitting]{.mark} the country's largest historically [black university
in two]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's what happened at North Carolina
Agricultural and Technical University in 2016; a school that was once in
the state's 12th Congressional District is now in the 6th and 13th. The
school is in Greensboro, where 40 percent of the population is black,
and the city has also been divided in two. Both new districts are
represented by white Republican men, and students have rallied against
the division.

[But the [new lines were]{.mark} actually [instituted **as**]{.mark}
**part of [a remedy for a]{.mark} previous [racial gerrymandering
case]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2016, a federal court struck down the
old lines down, ruling that Republican lawmakers had packed black
voters, meaning minorities were too isolated in one district to be
represented fairly statewide. (To make matters more confusing, the
entire state map is now being challenged in a partisan gerrymandering
case.)

[[The back-and-forth]{.mark}]{.underline} over electoral boundaries
[[has repeated]{.mark} itself for decades in Greensboro]{.underline}.
[Since 1990, the lines around the city have been redrawn six times even
though there have been only three rounds of normal post-census
redistricting]{.underline} during that period. The lines have been
argued before the Supreme Court five times. In many ways, the changing
lines in Greensboro illustrate a long-running debate over how to ensure
minority voters are represented in government.

This is the third installment of FiveThirtyEight's podcast series "The
Gerrymandering Project," in which we travel around the country to
explore the effects of gerrymandering and what reformers are doing to
change the redistricting process. In this episode, we focus on racial
gerrymandering in North Carolina.

As things stand today, partisan gerrymandering is not illegal, but
racial gerrymandering is. But that doesn't mean that everyone agrees on
what constitutes a racial gerrymander. The legal fight to define racial
gerrymandering has raged for decades, in no small part because the
answer has major implications for each party.

At the heart of that debate are majority-minority districts. A 1986
Supreme Court ruling, Thornburg v. Gingles, established that where
racially polarized voting1 is present, it is illegal to dilute minority
residents' voting power, either intentionally or unintentionally. States
across the South then drew new majority-minority districts to ensure
that black voters could elect their candidates of choice. [In many
places, [the newly drawn]{.mark} majority-minority [districts
elected]{.mark} those states' **[first African-American congressional
representatives]{.mark}** since Reconstruction]{.underline}.

[[It was a win for African-American representation]{.underline}]{.mark},
and also a win for Republicans. By grouping together black voters, who
vote overwhelmingly Democratic, the maps increased Republican electoral
prospects in the surrounding districts. That dynamic has encouraged
Republicans to advocate for majority-minority districts, while Democrats
have been more skeptical of them.

In North Carolina, the debate over majority-minority districts often
comes down to this complicated question: In a state where
African-Americans vote overwhelmingly for one party, is what's best for
African-Americans the same as what's best for Democrats?

#### Even if gerrymandering is bad, it's getting better -- the CP isn't necessary

**[Wehrman and Siegel 3/21]{.underline}** \[Jessica Wehrman, Dispatch
Washington Bureau, and Jim Siegel, The Columbus Dispatch, 3-21-2019,

\]

WASHINGTON --- [[Ohio has some of the nation's
most-gerrymandered]{.underline}]{.mark} statehouse and congressional
[[maps]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to a new Associated Press
analysis --- a fact that comes as no surprise to those who have
successfully pushed to reform the district-drawing process after the
next census.

With a firm grip on Ohio state government, including sizable majorities
in the House and Senate, Republicans were able to draw legislative and
congressional maps with pinpoint precision, helping ensure they would
maintain those majorities even if the political tide turned against them
for a cycle or two.

In Ohio House races last year, Republicans got 52 percent of the vote
but won 61 percent of the districts, allowing them to continue to hold a
super-majority despite losing five seats. Based on data compiled by the
Associated Press, Ohio's gerrymandered House districts allowed
Republicans to win seven more seats than they otherwise should have
judging by vote totals.

That means [the House]{.underline}, according to the analysis, [would be
54--46 Republican, instead of the current 61-38, if the map were drawn
fairly]{.underline}.

The GOP-drawn districts also protected Republicans in Ohio's U.S. House
delegation. Republicans got 52 percent of the vote but won 75 percent of
the seats --- the same 12-4 margin that has existed since the current
district maps were drawn in 2011. According to the AP analysis, Ohio's
maps allowed Republicans to hold three more seats than they otherwise
should have.

Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel for the Brennan Center for
Justice at the New York University School of Law, said Ohio has one of
the most "problematic" congressional maps in the nation, with an
impenetrable 12--4 GOP advantage.

[While Republicans hold all but one statewide nonjudicial office, he
dismisses the notion that the state is overwhelmingly
Republican]{.underline}.

"Ohio may be trending Republican, but [[it's not]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[75 percent Republican]{.underline}]{.mark} state," he said. The map
drawn in 2011 was "a very deliberate prioritization of politics over
everything else."

Richard Gunther, a professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State
University, said Ohio has been one of the worst actors in gerrymandering
by multiple standards.

Even a shift in voter preference from 2016 to 2018 couldn't overcome
gerrymandering. For example, he said, in Ohio, there was a 10.4 percent
shift of votes for Republicans running for Congress in 2016 to votes for
Democratic candidates in 2018. "Not one single seat was flipped," he
noted.

In Ohio's 12th District, where Republican Rep. Pat Tiberi's retirement
spurred a special election, there was a 15 percent shift of Republican
votes cast to Democratic votes cast, he said. It was not enough to
change the party holding the seat.

Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio, said the 2011
maps were drawn with "surgical precision," as GOP mapmakers used "a lot
more information than just typical partisan data" to create maps so
solid that they have remained unchanged over the decade.

"When you have a robust, strong gerrymander, it makes it harder for the
people who are marginalized to keep coming up with good people to run,"
she said.

Turcer and leaders of groups such as the League of Women Voters of Ohio
hope that, while Republicans continue to hold all of state government,
new voter--approved processes for drawing legislative and congressional
maps will significantly reduce partisan gerrymandering and produce
districts that better reflect the will of the electorate.

The goal of a congressional redistricting process approved by voters
last May is for a map drawn with significant bipartisan support ---
either by the legislature or, if that fails, a seven--member commission
of three statewide officeholders and four legislators.

And in 2015, voters approved a new process for legislative districts,
creating a seven-member commission with at least two minority--party
members. For a 10-year map to pass, it would take at least two
minority-party votes, and the process says the commission "shall attempt
to draw" a map that does not primarily favor a political party and
corresponds closely to the statewide preferences of voters.

But [[before the congressional maps are redrawn again in
2021]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[federal judges]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals [[will decide]{.underline}]{.mark},
based on a lawsuit filed by the League of Women Voters, ACLU and others,
**[[whether Ohio has to redraw that map before]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the **[[2020]{.underline}]{.mark}** election. Arguments on that case
were completed this month.

[[Tax Cuts]{.mark} and Tax Rebates Tax cuts and tax rebates are designed
to [put more money]{.mark} back [into]{.mark} the [pockets of]{.mark}
[consumers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ideally, these consumers spend a

[[these]{.mark} actions [increase productivity]{.mark}, which grows the

consumers to stimulate the econ]{.mark}omy themselves by imbuing it with
more money]{.underline}. In 2017, the Trump administration proposed, and
Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation lowered
corporate taxes to 20%--- the highest corporate income tax rate was 35%
before the bill. Various personal income tax brackets were lowered as
well. [The bill cost \$1.5 trillion and is designed to increase economic
growth for the next ten years. As with any stimulus used to spur
economic growth]{.underline}, it\'s often difficult to pinpoint how much
growth was created by the stimulus and how much was generated by other
factors and market forces. [[Stimulating]{.mark} the [Econ]{.mark}omy
[With Deregulation]{.mark} Deregulation is the relaxing of rules and
regulations imposed on an industry or business]{.underline}. It [[became
a centerpiece of economics in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[under]{.mark} the [Reagan]{.mark} administration in the
1980s]{.underline}, when the federal government deregulated several
industries, most notably financial institutions. Many economists credit
Reagan\'s deregulation with the robust economic growth that
characterized the U.S. during most of the 1980s and 1990s. Proponents of
deregulation argue [[tight regulations constrain business]{.mark}es and
prevent them from growing and operating to their full capabilities.
[This]{.mark}, in turn, [slows production and]{.mark} hiring, which
[inhibits]{.mark} GDP [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, economists
who favor regulations blame deregulation and a lack of government
oversight for the numerous economic bubbles that expanded and
subsequently burst during the 1990s and early 2000s. Many economists
cite that there was a lack of regulatory oversight leading up to the
financial crisis of 2008. Subprime mortgages, which are high-risk
mortgages to borrowers with less-than-perfect credit, began to default
in 2007. The mortgage industry collapsed, leading to a recession and
subsequent bailouts of several banks by the U.S. government. New
regulations were implemented in the years to follow that imposed
increased capital requirements for banks, meaning they need more cash on
hand to cover potential losses from bad loans. [[Using Infrastructure to
Spur]{.mark} Economic [Growth Infrastructure spending occurs
when]{.mark} a local, state, or federal [government spends money
to]{.mark} build or [repair]{.mark} the physical [structures]{.mark} and
facilities [needed for commerce]{.mark} and society as a whole to
thrive.]{.underline} Infrastructure includes roads, bridges, ports, and
sewer systems. Economists who favor infrastructure spending as an
economic catalyst argue that [having [top-notch]{.mark} [infrastructure
increases productivity]{.mark} by enabling businesses to operate as
efficiently as possible. For example, when roads and bridges are
abundant and in working order, trucks spend less time sitting in
traffic]{.underline}, and they don\'t have to take circuitous routes to
traverse waterways. Additionally, [[infrastructure spending creates jobs
as workers must be hired to]{.mark} [complete]{.mark} the green-lighted
[projects]{.mark}.]{.underline} It [is also capable of spawning new
economic growth]{.underline}. For example, the construction of a new
highway might lead to other investments such as gas stations and retail
stores opening to cater to motorists. During the Great Recession, the
Obama administration, along with Congress proposed and passed The
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The stimulus package was
designed to spur economic growth in the economy since business and
private investment was waning. The Obama stimulus as it\'s commonly
referred to included federal government spending exceeding \$80 billion
for highways, bridges, and roads. The stimulus was designed to help
create construction jobs that were hit hard due to the impact from
mortgage crisis on residential and commercial construction.

Advocates of tax cuts argue that reducing taxes improves the economy by
boosting spending; those who oppose them say that tax cuts only help the
rich because it can lead to a reduction in government services upon
which lower income people rely. In other words, there are two distinct
sides to this economic balancing scale. [The federal tax system relies
on a number of different types of taxes to generate revenues. The
largest sources of funds is the individual income tax and payroll tax.
Approximately [80% of]{.mark} tax [revenues are generated
through]{.mark} these [taxes]{.mark}. Personal [income taxes are levied
against income]{.mark}, interest, dividends and capital gains, with
higher earners generally paying higher tax rates, while the the payroll
tax is a tax levied at a fixed percentage on salaries and
wages,]{.underline} up to a certain limit and is paid equally by both
employer and employee. [Payroll taxes have become an important source of
revenue for the federal government and have grown more quickly than
income taxes]{.underline} as the government has raised rates and income
limits. Commonly known as the FICA (the Federal Insurance Contributions
Act) tax, the [payroll tax is used to pay Social Security benefits,
Medicare and unemployment benefits.]{.underline} (For related reading,
see Introduction To Social Security) In third comes corporate taxes,
comprising 10.6% of total taxes, and followed by excise taxes. Excise
taxes are a form of federal sales tax, levied on miscellaneous items
such as gasoline and tobacco. They account for 3.1% of the total tax
revenue. [[The]{.mark} federal [government uses tax policy to generate
revenue]{.mark} and places the burden where it believes it will have the
least effect. However, [the \"flypaper theory\" of

[The CBO now expects the nominal gross domestic product to increase
nearly \$750 billion more per year by 2020]{.underline} than in its
forecast prior to the tax cut. It originally attributed about one third
of that growth to the tax-cut legislation --- even by that estimate, the
cut more than pays for itself. [[The]{.mark} [CBO expects that]{.mark},
through a combination of real GDP growth and a burst of inflation, [the
cut will produce mo]{.mark}re tax [revenue]{.mark} [when]{.mark} the
middle-class tax [cuts expire than]{.mark} would have been the case
[without]{.mark} the cut]{.underline}. The [expected [increase
in]{.mark} tax [revenue]{.mark}, together with the elimination of the
health-care mandate, which saves more money than it costs, and other
pushes and pulls, [more than pays for the]{.mark} interest [expense from
deficits]{.mark} that accumulate in the interim.]{.underline} That
expense includes additional interest paid on all federal debt from an
expected rise in interest rates stemming from the tax cut. [The eventual
increase in tax revenue enables the cut to pay off its debt gradually.
[With]{.mark} its [financing costs covered and]{.mark} the [debt
accumulated from the cut now declining]{.mark}, the [legislation leaves
future]{.mark} generations to enjoy more real after-tax GDP than would
have been the case without the tax cut.]{.underline} Distributional
analysis indicates that households across all income levels share these
gains. Contrary to popular belief, [[a tax cut doesn't need to
recover]{.mark} its [lost]{.mark} tax [revenues to make future
generations more prosperous]{.mark}. That's an illogically high standard
used as spin by opponents of tax cuts. [If you borrow money to buy an
asset that permanently produces more income than the cost of the
interest on the money you borrowed to buy the asset, you and your
children are made richer]{.mark} by the additional]{.underline} income
the asset produces, not poorer by the amount of the money you borrowed.
That's why investors make investments. The 2018 tax-cut legislation is
no different. [Borrowing makes future generations poorer only if
borrowers consume rather than invest the proceeds, leaving future
generations with no increased earning capacity to pay for the interest
on the debt]{.underline}. By increasing real GDP and collecting more in
additional taxes than the incremental cost of its financing, the tax cut
makes future generations better off.

Advocates of tax cuts argue that reducing taxes improves the economy by
boosting spending; those who oppose them say that tax cuts only help the
rich because it can lead to a reduction in government services upon
which lower income people rely. In other words, there are two distinct
sides to this economic balancing scale. [The federal tax system relies
on a number of different types of taxes to generate revenues. The
largest sources of funds is the individual income tax and payroll tax.
Approximately [80% of]{.mark} tax [revenues are generated
through]{.mark} these [taxes]{.mark}. Personal [income taxes are levied
against income]{.mark}, interest, dividends and capital gains, with
higher earners generally paying higher tax rates, while the the payroll
tax is a tax levied at a fixed percentage on salaries and
wages,]{.underline} up to a certain limit and is paid equally by both
employer and employee. [Payroll taxes have become an important source of
revenue for the federal government and have grown more quickly than
income taxes]{.underline} as the government has raised rates and income
limits. Commonly known as the FICA (the Federal Insurance Contributions
Act) tax, the [payroll tax is used to pay Social Security benefits,
Medicare and unemployment benefits.]{.underline} (For related reading,
see Introduction To Social Security) In third comes corporate taxes,
comprising 10.6% of total taxes, and followed by excise taxes. Excise
taxes are a form of federal sales tax, levied on miscellaneous items
such as gasoline and tobacco. They account for 3.1% of the total tax
revenue. [[The]{.mark} federal [government uses tax policy to generate
revenue]{.mark} and places the burden where it believes it will have the
least effect. However, [the \"flypaper theory\" of
taxation]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(the belief that the burden of
the tax sticks to where the government places the tax), often [[proves
to be incorrect]{.mark}. Instead, tax shifting occurs. [Shifting tax

Unfortunately, [some zealous [proponents of tax cuts]{.mark}
[foolishly]{.mark} [promised]{.mark} that [cuts]{.mark} [would]{.mark}
immediately [produce]{.mark} [more]{.mark} tax [revenues]{.mark}.
[Opponents]{.mark} of tax cuts [seized]{.mark} on [that]{.mark} standard
--- that [a tax cut hasn't paid for itself]{.mark} until it has paid
down all of its resulting debt --- [for]{.mark} [propaganda]{.mark}
purposes. [It is]{.mark} simply [not the case]{.mark} that an
[investment]{.mark} that [leads]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a [permanent
increase]{.mark} in income [large enough to cover]{.mark} its
[financing]{.mark} cost need ever pay back its debt. A permanent
increase in GDP and tax revenues --- what this legislation produces ---
produces a permanent increase in debt capacity]{.underline}. [Without
this basic understanding of finance, all deficits look the same, with no
apparent difference between deficit-financed consumption and its
opposite]{.underline}, legislation that increases GDP and fully covers
its financing cost, as this legislation does. Deficit-financed
consumption increases debt without increasing America's capacity to
finance the increased interest expense. That hurts future generations,
unlike this tax-cut legislation. Misinformed deficit hawks and opponents
of tax cuts fail to differentiate between the two kinds of deficits. [A
more [relevant]{.mark} [comparison asks whether]{.mark} this [investment
is better than]{.mark} [alternative]{.mark} investment
[opportunities]{.mark}. It is surely the case that the [business-tax
cuts]{.mark} on their own [would have grown GDP without
producing]{.mark} the large [deficits]{.mark} created by the
middle-class tax cuts.]{.underline} The latter create little, if any,
long-term growth. But it's hardly obvious that the legislation would
have passed without the cuts for the middle class. Cuts that lower taxes
for most voters, as this legislation does, run the risk that lawmakers
will extend the cuts beyond their stipulated expiration. For that reason
and others, I opposed the middle-class cuts. But analysis that avoids
debating the legislation

its entirety --- legislation that includes not only cuts but also [a
partial expiration of those cuts and a rollback of the health-care
mandate]{.underline}, both [measures contributing substantially to
deficit reduction --- deceives the public. [Saying]{.mark} that [the
tax-cut]{.mark} legislation [is risky is different from saying]{.mark}
that the [enacted legislation doesn't pay for

increase]{.mark} in GDP [that unfolds gradually]{.mark} over many years.
Once increased, GDP returns to its prior long-term growth
rate,]{.underline} but it now grows from a permanently higher level.
[This permanent long-term gain is somewhat obfuscated by the CBO's
forecast. [Reductions in]{.mark} the business-[tax rate increase]{.mark}
the [rate of]{.mark} [investment]{.mark}, which gradually increases
GDP]{.underline}. At the same time, reductions in the personal-tax rate
lead taxpayers to work harder until those cuts expire. [[This causes
short-term growth to overshoot]{.mark} expected [long-term
growth]{.mark}. Growth declines at the end of the forecast period, when
the personal-tax cuts expire and work rates return to pre-cut
levels.]{.underline} The business-tax cuts lead to a permanent increase
in GDP. Eventually, growth, together with the expiration of the
personal-tax cuts and the rollback of the health-care mandate, produce
enough additional revenue and cost reduction to more than pay for the
additional financing cost that occurs as a result of the cut. [[This
surplus]{.mark} eventually [produces more deficit]{.mark}
[reduction]{.mark} [than]{.mark} would have been the case
[without]{.mark} the legislation.]{.underline} From the broader

#### Infrastructure is key to all aspects of the economy and competitiveness \-\-- creating national infrastructure bank avoids funding issues

[**Most [experts]{.mark}** [agree the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[must address]{.mark} the nation's [aging network]{.mark} of roads,
bridges, airports, railways, power grids, water systems, and other
[public works to maintain]{.mark} its global [economic
competitiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2010, President Barack [Obama
proposed a national infrastructure bank (PDF) that would leverage public
and private capital to fund improvements]{.underline}, and in April 2011
a bipartisan coalition of senators put forward a similar concept (NYT).
Four experts discuss how the United States can best move forward on
infrastructure development. Robert Puentes of the Brookings Institution
suggests focusing on increasing exports, low-carbon technology,
innovation, and opportunity. Renowned financier Felix Rohatyn endorses
the concept of a federally owned but independently operated national
infrastructure bank that would provide a \"guidance-system\" for federal
dollars. Infrastructure policy authority Richard Little argues that
adequate revenue streams are the \"first step in addressing this
problem,\" stressing \"revenue-based models\" as essential. Deputy Mayor
of New York City Stephen Goldsmith says that the \"most promising
ideas\" in this policy area involve public-private partnerships. [Robert
Puentes [Infrastructure is central to U.S]{.mark}. [prosperity]{.mark}
and global competitiveness. It matters because state-of-the-art

for too long, [the nation's [infrastructure policies have been kept
separate]{.mark} and apart [from]{.mark} the larger [conversation about
the]{.mark} U.S. [economy]{.mark}. The benefits of infrastructure are
**frequently framed around short-term goals** about job
creation]{.underline}. While the focus on employment growth is certainly
understandable, it is not the best way to target and deploy
infrastructure dollars. And it means so-called \"shovel ready projects\"
are all we can do while long-term investments in the smart grid,
high-speed rail, and modern ports are stuck at the starting gate. We
often fail to make infrastructure investments in an economy-enhancing
way. This is why the proposal for a national infrastructure bank is so
important. So in addition to the focus on job growth in the short term,
[[we need to rebalance the]{.mark} American [economy for]{.mark} the
long term on several key elements: **[higher exports]{.mark}**, to take
advantage of **rising global demand**; **low-carbon technology**, [to
lead]{.mark} the [clean-energy]{.mark} revolution; innovation, [to spur
growth]{.mark} through ideas and their deployment; [and greater
opportunity]{.mark}, to reverse the troubling, decades-long rise in
inequality. [Infrastructure is **fundamental to each**]{.mark} **of
those elements.**]{.underline} Yet while we know America's
infrastructure needs are substantial, we have not been able to pull
together the resources to make the requisite investments. And when we
do, we often fail to make infrastructure investments in an
economy-enhancing way[. This is why the proposal for a national
infrastructure bank is so important. If designed and implemented
appropriately, it would be a targeted mechanism to deal with critical
new investments on a merit basis,]{.underline} while adhering to market
forces and leveraging the private capital we know is ready to invest
here in the United States. Building the next economy will require
deliberate and purposeful action, across all levels of government, in
collaboration with the private and nonprofit sectors. Infrastructure is
a big piece of that. Felix G. Rohatyn [While America's economic
competitors and partners around the world make massive investments in
public infrastructure, [our]{.mark} nation's [roads and bridges]{.mark},
schools and hospitals, airports and railways, ports and dams,
waterlines, and air-control systems [are rapidly]{.mark} and dangerously
[deteriorating]{.mark}. China, India, and European nations are
spending]{.underline}\--or have spent\--[the equivalent of hundreds of
billions of dollars on efficient public transportation, energy, and
water systems.]{.underline} Meanwhile, the American Society of Civil
Engineers estimated in 2005 [that it would take \$1.6 trillion simply to
make U.S. infrastructure dependable and saf]{.underline}e. The obvious,
negative impact of this situation on our global competitiveness, quality
of life, and ability to create American jobs is a problem we no longer
can ignore.

About the only issue on which Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton agreed
during the 2016 presidential race was the need to rebuild America's
infrastructure---roads, bridges, mass-transit systems, and the like. In
fact, [[Trump proposed spending]{.mark} twice as much [on
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} as Clinton did[. [That endeared him
to]{.mark} his [base voters]{.mark}, who saw it as a concrete
(literally) manifestation of his promise to "make America great
again."]{.underline} The country's infrastructure is certainly in sorry
shape. The American Society of Civil Engineers rates the overall
condition of our bridges as C+ and our roads and mass transit systems as
D. Many of these structures, built decades ago, are reaching the end of
their useful lives. Under pressure from traditional conservatives in
Congress, who are no fans of big domestic spending projects, Trump
agreed to defer infrastructure until after his first 100 days in office.
But [[a big push]{.mark} on the issue by the administration clearly [is
coming]{.mark}. Indeed, [Trump has profound political]{.mark} and
personal [reasons to fulfill the]{.mark} [promise]{.mark} he made during
the campaign.]{.underline} His whole professional identity, after all,
revolves around the creation of steel and concrete structures (usually
built by others) with his name on them. [And [an infrastructure
build-out of the size]{.mark} he has talked about--- upwards of \$1
trillion---[would]{.mark} surely [juice a]{.mark}n already [growing
econ]{.mark}omy and provide well-paying jobs]{.underline} for many of
the non-college-educated white male voters who supported him.
Advertisement Moreover, [some close [Trump advisers see infrastructure
as a way to pull Dem]{.mark}ocratic [voters]{.mark}, including some
minorities, [into]{.mark} a new [political coalition]{.mark} that will
remake the Republican Party and keep it in power for
decades.]{.underline} "With negative interest rates throughout the
world, [it's the greatest opportunity to rebuild
everything,"]{.underline} Trump campaign CEO and now chief White House
strategist Steve Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter soon after the
elections. "Shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up[.
[We're]{.mark} just [going to throw it]{.mark} up [against the wall and
see if it sticks]{.mark}. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater
than the Reagan revolution---[conservatives, plus populists, in an
economic]{.mark} nationalist [movement]{.mark}."]{.underline} Such
grandiose political hopes aside, many Democratic lawmakers are clearly
open to working with Trump. In fact, Senate Democrats have proposed
spending the same amount on infrastructure as Trump has: \$1 trillion.
That is far more than most GOP lawmakers are comfortable spending. But
precisely because of that Republican resistance, [[Trump will]{.mark}
almost certainly [need large numbers of]{.mark} Democratic [votes to
pass]{.mark} [a]{.mark}ny substantive infrastructure [bill. That means
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} likely [will have significant
leverage]{.mark} in determining the shape of such
legislation]{.underline}. [[What should Democrats demand in
return]{.mark} for their support?]{.underline} For one thing, that Trump
drop the idea his advisers floated in November for \$85 billion in new
tax credits for infrastructure investors. The private sector must be
involved in America's infrastructure build-out, but tax credits are a
very expensive way of making that happen. Tax credits attract private
investors and corporations needing high rates of return to offset their
tax liabilities, returns in the range of 18 to 35 percent annually. But
infrastructure investments don't typically produce those kinds of high
returns unless the risks are somehow shifted onto others, typically
taxpayers. With interest rates at 3 percent, it's much cheaper and less
risky to the public for the federal government to simply borrow the
money and have it paid back by local sources, both public and private.
Even more importantly, liberals should recognize that it is no longer
2009. Back then, to stabilize an economy in free-fall, Democrats passed
a massive stimulus bill with tens of billions of dollars devoted to
whatever "shovel ready" projects state transportation departments
happened to have on the shelf---widening interstates, paving rural
roads, etc.

Americans, [creating good jobs and higher income]{.mark}s for many.
Decrepit [infrastructure costs each U.S. household]{.mark} an average of
\$[3,400 every year]{.mark} due to productivity losses]{.underline},
higher transportation costs and other problems, according to the ASCE.
[That [amounts to]{.mark} about [\$4 trillion]{.mark} in total over a
decade, plus 2.5 million in lost jobs]{.underline}. It can also result
in lost lives or severe health risks, such as when a bridge collapses or
lead from an old pipe enters the water supply. That's likely why the
public overwhelmingly supports more spending on infrastructure -- and
why the deal between Trump and the Democrats finally came together. But
it's unclear whether Congress will ultimately agree to spend the
promised \$2 trillion -- or even whether that'll be enough. So it's
important to establish spending priorities. [[Spending]{.mark} in areas
[that will help struggling]{.mark} working and [middle-class families
hurt]{.mark} by ever-rising [economic]{.mark}
[inequality]{.mark}]{.underline} would be a good place to start. As
research by myself and others has shown, [[inequality makes]{.mark}
almost [every aspect of human life worse]{.mark}, from infant mortality
and crime to politics. 1[. The water crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} That's
why a top priority should be addressing the lack of potable water in
many parts of the country. Water is necessary for basic human survival.
And [unsafe water [puts people's health and]{.mark} even their [lives at
risk]{.mark}. [This has]{.mark} long-term [consequences]{.mark},
especially for children. Furthermore, [it reduces earnings]{.mark} and
increases health care costs, [which are]{.mark} ultimately [paid for
by]{.mark} everyone through [lower tax collections]{.mark}]{.underline}
and higher insurance premiums. The ASCE report gave America's drinking
water a D grade due to all the waste and risks from the nation's
ancient, leaky and corroding piping system. And [[it's]{.mark} a problem
that primarily [afflicts poor communities]{.mark}]{.underline}, like
Flint, Michigan. [[Affluent communities]{.mark} usually [have]{.mark}
the [political power]{.mark} [to ensure safe drinking water]{.mark} and
the money to pay slightly higher taxes for clean water if necessary.
[Low-income]{.mark} [neighborhoods]{.mark} are usually neighborhoods
[with little political clout]{.mark} and will [suffer most from water
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Low-income areas are also less able to
cope with undrinkable water and afford the costs of replacing tap water
with bottled water. And people living in poor neighborhoods lack the
ability to move, especially if they own homes that declined sharply in
value because of water problem, as happened in Flint.

### 1NC -- H1B CP

#### Text: The United States federal government should increase the cap on H1B and EB visas to meet the needs of businesses 

#### The counterplan solves -- increasing the cap on H1B visas improves the economy and solves better than the affirmative 

**[Salmon 8]{.underline}** (Diem salmon - Health policy fellow, The

Starting on April 1, any foreigner in the world who has a specialized
skill with a college degree or higher will have only one day to apply
for a U.S. work visa for fiscal year (FY) 2009. After that, [many
experts predict that [the cap for H-1B visas will be met, requiring
foreigners to wait]{.mark} another [12 months before applying again and
leaving American companies]{.mark} without needed
[worker]{.mark}s]{.underline}. H-1B visas are given to highly educated
foreigners who are sponsored by American employers. [As the law
currently stands, a maximum of 65,000 visas is given each fiscal
year]{.underline}. Admitting such a low number of qualified workers
hurts the high-tech industry in the United States and pushes the
smartest people to work in competing countries like China. Some U.S
companies that are desperate for workers, like Microsoft, have moved
certain branches to Canada and Mexico. Representatives Gabrielle
Giffords (D-AZ) and Lamar Smith (R-TX) have recognized the gravity of
the problem and have introduced similar bills raising the cap for H-1B
visas. [[Raising the cap is a]{.mark} necessary [first step, but more
should be done to make H-1B visas flexible. **Their number should
reflect the economy\'s need for high-tech workers-**]{.mark}**not
arbitrary limits [set by Congress.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As with other
work visas, [employers must navigate highly complicated procedures to
hire workers on an H-1B visa.]{.underline} The application process
involves several U.S. departments and is often a bureaucratic nightmare.
Despite these obstacles, the visas are popular with employers.
[[Congress has tried to fix the H-1B cap before, but these fixes were
temporary]{.mark} and largely ineffective]{.underline}. The cap was
raised to 115,000 visas in 1999 and to 195,000 visas in 2001. Because of
the pitfalls of navigating the application process, combined with the
economic slowdown of 2002, [not all of the visas authorized were issued
in FY 2003.]{.underline} As a result, an excess of 117,000 visas was
discarded at the end of the year. Congress lowered the cap back to
65,000 for FY 2003. Since that year, employers have used every
authorized visa. Employers have also exhausted the annual H-1B visa
supply at a faster rate. In 2007, employers used up the entire quota
less than a day after U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS)
started accepting applications, and USCIS conducted a lottery to
determine which workers would receive visas. **[Not all H-1B visas are
counted against the cap]{.underline}**. The first 20,000 H-1B visas
issued to workers with a master\'s degree or higher are not deducted
from the 65,000 cap.Employees of universities are similarly exempt. On
the other hand, Singapore and Chile have a guaranteed 6,800 visas, which
are counted against the 65,000 cap. [[Increasing the cap on H-1B visas
creates new jobs for **American workers,** not just H-1B
immigran]{.mark}ts]{.underline}. [Employees do not compete for a fixed
number of jobs so that when more H-1B workers come to the United States,
an equal number of Americans lose their jobs.]{.underline} Instead,
**[[businesses create jobs when they grow and shed jobs when they
shrink]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Currently, the economy has a severe
shortage of workers for many high-skilled positions. The unemployment
rate in computer and mathematical occupations, like computer
programming, was 2.1 percent in 2007-essentially full employment after
accounting for workers between jobs.\[2\] [There are not enough
high-tech workers in America to fill the jobs that employers want them
to do. [By increasing the H-1B cap, Congress would allow companies to
fill vital positions and enable them to expand within the United States,
which avoids the problem of companies outsourcing work or moving]{.mark}

#### H1B visas are net better for the economy -- immigrants allow for a positive impact on the economy

**[AIC 16]{.underline}** (American Immigration Council, "The H-1B Visa
Program: A Primer on the Program and Its Impact on Jobs, Wages, and the
Economy" Published: 2016 DOA:7-23-19
<https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/h1b-visa-program-fact-sheet>

In today's labor market, **[[foreign workers fill a critical
need]{.underline}]{.mark}**---particularly in the Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Many opponents of the H-1B visa
seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues.
In reality, **[[workers do not necessarily compete against each other
for a fixed number of jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United States has
created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and
skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born
workers to build it**.** [Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S.
economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic
expansion. Indeed, [H-1B workers positively impact our economy and the
employment opportunities of native-born
workers]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Despite suggestions to the contrary,
[the overwhelming [evidence shows]{.mark} that [H-1B workers do
not drive down wages]{.mark} of native-born workers[, **with**
]{.mark}**some [studies showing a positive impact]{.mark} on wages
[overall]{.mark}**]{.underline}.  From the creation of the H-1B program
in 1990 to 2010, H[-1B-driven increases in STEM workers were associated
with a significant increase in wages for college-educated, U.S.-born
workers in 219 U.S. cities]{.underline}. A one percentage point increase
in foreign STEM workers' share of a city's total employment was
associated with increases in wages of 7 to 8 percentage points paid to
both STEM and non-STEM college-educated natives, while non-college
educated workers saw an increase of 3 to 4 percentage points. From 2009
to 2011, [wage growth for U.S.-born workers with at least a bachelor's
degree was nominal]{.underline}, but wage growth for workers in
occupations with large numbers of H-1B petitions was substantially
higher. For example, in the Computer Systems Design and Related Services
category, there has been a 5.5 percent wage growth since 1990 and a 7
percent wage growth since 2009. In comparison, wage growth across all
industries has been 0.8 percent since 1990 and 1.6 percent since 2009.
On average, [**[H-1B workers earn higher wages than employed U.S.-born
workers with bachelor's degrees]{.underline}**:]{.mark} \$76,356
compared to \$67,301, including in areas like computer and information
technology, engineering, healthcare, and post-secondary education. When
comparing workers of the same age cohort and occupation, [H-1B workers
earn higher wages than their native-born counterparts.]{.underline}
Specifically, in 17 out of 20 age cohort and occupation groups, wages
for H-1B workers are higher than non-H-1B workers. Factors such as
gender, marital status, and ethnicity play a larger role than
citizenship or immigration status for wages in the tech and finance
industries---industries that use a large number of H-1B visas. A
worker's geographic region also accounts for significant differences in
wages.

### 2NC -- H1B -- Solvency

#### The counterplan solves -- increasing the cap on H1B visas improves the economy and solves better than the affirmative 

**[Salmon 8]{.underline}** (Diem salmon - Health policy fellow, The
Heritage Foundation, "Increasing the Cap for H-1B Visas Would Help the
Economy," "published: 3-31-2008 DOA:7-24-19
<https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/increasing-the-cap-h-1b-visas-would-help-the-economy>

Starting on April 1, any foreigner in the world who has a specialized
skill with a college degree or higher will have only one day to apply
for a U.S. work visa for fiscal year (FY) 2009. After that, [many
experts predict that [the cap for H-1B visas will be met, requiring
foreigners to wait]{.mark} another [12 months before applying again and
leaving American companies]{.mark} without needed
[worker]{.mark}s]{.underline}. H-1B visas are given to highly educated
foreigners who are sponsored by American employers. [As the law
currently stands, a maximum of 65,000 visas is given each fiscal
year]{.underline}. Admitting such a low number of qualified workers
hurts the high-tech industry in the United States and pushes the
smartest people to work in competing countries like China. Some U.S
companies that are desperate for workers, like Microsoft, have moved
certain branches to Canada and Mexico. Representatives Gabrielle
Giffords (D-AZ) and Lamar Smith (R-TX) have recognized the gravity of
the problem and have introduced similar bills raising the cap for H-1B
visas. [[Raising the cap is a]{.mark} necessary [first step, but more
should be done to make H-1B visas flexible. **Their number should
reflect the economy\'s need for high-tech workers-**]{.mark}**not
arbitrary limits [set by Congress.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As with other
work visas, [employers must navigate highly complicated procedures to
hire workers on an H-1B visa.]{.underline} The application process
involves several U.S. departments and is often a bureaucratic nightmare.
Despite these obstacles, the visas are popular with employers.
[[Congress has tried to fix the H-1B cap before, but these fixes were
temporary]{.mark} and largely ineffective]{.underline}. The cap was
raised to 115,000 visas in 1999 and to 195,000 visas in 2001. Because of
the pitfalls of navigating the application process, combined with the
economic slowdown of 2002, [not all of the visas authorized were issued
in FY 2003.]{.underline} As a result, an excess of 117,000 visas was
discarded at the end of the year. Congress lowered the cap back to
65,000 for FY 2003. Since that year, employers have used every
authorized visa. Employers have also exhausted the annual H-1B visa
supply at a faster rate. In 2007, employers used up the entire quota
less than a day after U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS)
started accepting applications, and USCIS conducted a lottery to
determine which workers would receive visas. **[Not all H-1B visas are
counted against the cap]{.underline}**. The first 20,000 H-1B visas
issued to workers with a master\'s degree or higher are not deducted
from the 65,000 cap.Employees of universities are similarly exempt. On
the other hand, Singapore and Chile have a guaranteed 6,800 visas, which
are counted against the 65,000 cap. [[Increasing the cap on H-1B visas
creates new jobs for **American workers,** not just H-1B
immigran]{.mark}ts]{.underline}. [Employees do not compete for a fixed
number of jobs so that when more H-1B workers come to the United States,
an equal number of Americans lose their jobs.]{.underline} Instead,
**[[businesses create jobs when they grow and shed jobs when they
shrink]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Currently, the economy has a severe
shortage of workers for many high-skilled positions. The unemployment
rate in computer and mathematical occupations, like computer
programming, was 2.1 percent in 2007-essentially full employment after
accounting for workers between jobs.\[2\] [There are not enough
high-tech workers in America to fill the jobs that employers want them
to do. [By increasing the H-1B cap, Congress would allow companies to
fill vital positions and enable them to expand within the United States,
which avoids the problem of companies outsourcing work or moving]{.mark}
[overseas]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[In]{.mark} America's [heated debate over immigration, there's plenty
of]{.mark} divisive [rhetoric]{.mark} punctuated by strong emotions and
precious few facts.]{.underline} Immigrants have been characterized as
criminals who take well-paying jobs from Americans and damage the
economy. President Donald [[Trump was elected]{.mark}, in part,
[on]{.mark} his [promises to build a]{.mark} border [wall]{.mark} with
Mexico,]{.underline} to ban Muslims from entering the country, and to
narrow the path to citizenship. Since taking office, [[his
admin]{.mark}istration has [implemented policy]{.mark} changes [that
increase scrutiny of immigrants]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} not
extending work permits or protections for certain nationalities and
tightening visas for [high-skilled workers]{.mark}.]{.underline} While
the measures have led to numerous lawsuits and more shouting matches
among TV pundits, effective reform remains elusive. That's because the
debate often fails to focus more broadly on the whole economic picture,
according to Wharton management professor Exequiel Hernandez. In a new
brief for the Penn Wharton Public Policy Initiative, Hernandez explained
that jobs and wages are only part of the story. His research shows that
[[immigrants have]{.mark} a [powerful]{.mark} [effect on]{.mark} both
capital [investment]{.mark} [and innovation]{.mark}, and their [presence
in a community can positively influence]{.mark} a [firm's]{.mark}
[operations]{.mark}. [All]{.mark} these factors can [lead to]{.mark}
greater economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}, suggesting that
policymakers should consult with firms before making decisions regarding
immigration. "[The bigger picture here is that the economy isn't just
powered by jobs and wages[,]{.mark} [it's]{.mark} also [powered]{.mark}
[by capital investment and innovation that makes]{.mark} both
[workers]{.mark} and capital [more productive]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
and all three of those are affected by immigration," Hernandez said.
"You can't pull one lever back and not hurt the other two. " Hernandez
spoke about the topic on the Knowledge@Wharton radio show, which airs on
Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM. (Listen to the podcast at the top of

by foreigners on an H-1B visa]{.mark}]{.underline}**,** a temporary
permit for highly skilled workers, according to an eye-popping study by
Goldman Sachs. [[President Trump has been highly critical of the program
and has suggested he would scale it back. Critics]{.underline}]{.mark},
like Trump, say companies abuse it to hire cheap labor. Those critical
of the program [[say the time is now for Trump to reform
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[We estimate that 900,000 to 1 million
individuals are working under H-1B visas in the U.S.
today]{.underline}," said the Goldman Sachs study, which was published
in February, "[based on the assumption that most existing visas are
renewed for a second term, and that about two-thirds of qualified H-1B
visa holders eventually apply for a green card.]{.underline}" Last week,
when asked about progress on H-1B visa reform, Press Secretary Sean
Spicer said [[Trump was reviewing the issue]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} He
did not offer a timetable on when **[[Trump would make changes to the
visa program]{.underline}]{.mark}** but an executive order revamping it
is reportedly under review. "**[[The president\'s
action]{.mark}s]{.underline}** that he\'s taken in terms of his

our people safe. [[And then, obviously, whether it\'s H-1B visas or
the]{.mark} other one -- spousal visas -- [other areas of student
visas]{.mark},"]{.underline} Spicer said. "I think there is a natural
desire to have a full look at -- a comprehensive look at that." The H-1B
visa is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary
workers. To obtain one, an employer must offer a foreigner a job and
then apply for his or her H-1B visa petition with the U.S. Immigration
Department. Under the visa, the foreigner is allowed to work but is
required to return home after five years -- but the work permit could be
extended. The visa was created so companies could find workers in
hard-to-fill, highly specialized positions.

#### The trump administration likes high skilled visas

[Here's what is known about [Kushner's plan]{.mark}, which is not an
actual bill and may never become one. It [would boost]{.mark}
[skills-based immigration]{.mark} from 12 percent to 57 percent of total

about 1.1 million green cards per year[. Prospective [immigrants would
be awarded points based on]{.mark} criteria such as [offers for
high-paying jobs]{.mark}, English language skills, [and advanced
degrees]{.mark}]{.underline}. To offset the nearly fivefold increase in
skills-based immigration, Trump wants to eliminate the diversity visa
lottery, which provides 50,000 green cards per year to citizens of
countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. The plan
would also limit family immigration, which allows relatives of legal US
residents to immigrate, to children and spouses. That would stop
immigrants from sponsoring siblings, and potentially adult children and
parents, for green cards. [If [the]{.mark} new high-skilled immigrants
are anything like today's, the main effect of the [proposal

In recent weeks media outlets in the US have been fretting over what
would ordinarily be considered good news [-- [the]{.mark} roaring
American [economy]{.mark}, which [has]{.mark} [brought]{.mark} low
unemployment and, in some places, [a labour
shortage]{.mark}]{.underline}. Owners and managers have complained about
their problems in finding people to fill low-wage positions. "Nobody
wants to do manual labour any more," as one trade association grandee
told the Baltimore Sun, and so the manual labour simply goes undone.
[Company bosses talk about the things they have done to fix the
situation: the ads they've published; the guest-worker visas for which
they've applied; how they are going into schools to encourage kids to
learn construction skills or to drive trucks.]{.underline} The Wall
Street Journal reports on the amazing perks that plumbing companies are
now offering new hires: quiet rooms, jetski trips, pottery classes, free
breakfast, free beer. But nothing seems to work. [**[Blame for the
labour shortage is sprayed all over the]{.mark} US [map]{.mark}**:
opioids are said to be the problem. And [welfare,]{.mark} and inadequate
parking spaces, and [a falling birthrate]{.mark}, and mass
incarceration, [and]{.mark} -- above all -- the [Trump]{.mark}
administration's [immigration policies]{.mark}. But no one really knows
for sure.]{.underline} So the labour shortage runs on, frightening and
out of control, with journalists trying to build it into some kind of
nightmare scenario. There is a "crab crisis" in the Chesapeake Bay
region. There's no one to harvest the strawberries in Ohio. A beloved
bakery outside Denver has closed. Plans for a retirement community near
Tucson, Arizona, have been cancelled. Managers and officials alike
demand that the government furnish them with the cheap workforce to
which they are accustomed. The textbook solution to the labour shortage
problem -- paying workers more -- rarely merits more than a line or two,
if it's mentioned at all. So unwilling are business leaders to talk
about or consider this obvious answer that Neel Kashkari, the president
of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, scolded them last year: "If
you're not raising wages, then it just sounds like whining." When the
necessity of higher wages is acknowledged, however, it only seems to
crank the whining to a higher pitch. Take for instance the Washington
Post's front-page panic attack: "Trucker shortage poses economic
threat". Here the problem of trucks sitting idle for lack of drivers is
compounded by the even more infernal possibility that those drivers,
when they finally do show up, might be in a position to bargain for
better pay, a prospect described as "perilous" because it could drive up
prices "so quickly that the country faces uncontrolled inflation, which
can easily lead to a recession".

Allowing skilled emigration is stealing human capital from poor
countries.\" No. Many of the same countries courted by the United States
through aid and trade deals complain bitterly of the \"brain drain\" of
their doctors, scientists, and engineers to the United States and other
rich countries. If correct, these complaints would mean that current
immigration policy amounts to counterproductive foreign policy.
Thankfully, however, the [[flow of]{.mark} skilled [emigrants]{.mark}
from poor to rich parties can actually [benefit both parties.
This]{.mark} common [idea]{.mark} that skilled emigration amounts to
\"stealing\" [requires]{.mark} a [cartoonish]{.mark} set of [assumptions
about developing countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, [[it
requires]{.mark} us [to assume]{.mark} that developing countries
[possess a finite stock of]{.mark} skilled [workers]{.mark}, a stock
depleted by one for every departure. In fact, people respond to the
incentives created by migration: Enormous numbers of skilled workers
from developing countries have been induced to acquire their skills by
the opportunity of high earnings abroad]{.underline}. [[This is why the
Philippines]{.mark}, which [sends]{.mark} [more nurses abroad than
any]{.mark} other developing [country, still has more nurses per
capita]{.mark} at home than Britain does.]{.underline} Recent research
has also shown that a sudden[, [large increase in skilled
emigration]{.mark} from a developing country to a skill-selective
destination can [cause a]{.mark} corresponding [sudden increase in skill
acquisition]{.mark} in the source country. Second, believing that
skilled emigration amounts to theft from the poor requires us to assume
that skilled workers themselves are not poor.]{.underline} In Zambia, a
nurse has to get by on less than \$1,500 per year --- measured at U.S.
prices, not Zambian ones --- and a doctor must make ends meet with less
than \$5,500 per year, again at U.S. prices. If these were your annual
wages, facing U.S. price levels, you would likely consider yourself
destitute. [Third, believing that a person's choice to emigrate
constitutes \"stealing\" requires problematic assumptions about that
person's rights.]{.underline} The United Nations Universal Declaration
of Human Rights states that all people have an unqualified right to
leave any country. Skilled migrants are not \"owned\" by their home
countries, and should have the same rights to freedom of movement as
professionals in rich countries.

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- Infrastructure

#### Infrastructure doesn't provide short term stimulus - planning constraints check immediate growth 

**[De Rugy 11]{.underline}**( Veronique DE Rugy senior research fellow
at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \"Why Infrastructure
Spending Is a Bad Bet,\" Published:9-8-11 DOA:7-24-19
https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/why-infrastructure-spending-bad-bet-veronique-de-rugy/

No one disputes that American public works need improving, and
[economists have long recognized the value of infrastructure. Roads,
bridges, airports, and canals are the conduits through which goods are
exchanged. However, whatever its merits, [infrastructure spending
is]{.mark} [unlikely to provide]{.mark} much of a
[stimulus]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and it certainly won't provide the
boost that the president will promise the American people tonight. For
one thing, even though Mark Zandi claims that the bang for the buck is
significant when the government spends \$1 on infrastructure (\$1.44 in
growth), that's just his opinion. The reality is that economists are far
from having reached a consensus on what the actual return on
infrastructure spending is. As economists Eric Leeper, Todd Walker, and
Shu-Chum Yang put it in a recent paper for the IMF: "Economists have
offered an embarrassingly wide range of estimated multipliers." Among
respected economists, some find larger multipliers and some find
negative ones. (Thanks Matt Mitchell for this great paper). Second,
[according to Keynesian economists, [for spending to be stimulative, it
has to be timely]{.mark}, targeted, [and temporary]{.mark}.
[Infrastructure spending isn't any of that]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's
because [infrastructure [projects involve planning]{.mark}, bidding,
contracting, construction, [and evaluation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Only
\$28 billion of the \$45 billion in DOT money included in the stimulus
has been spent so far. We know that the [[stimulus money wasn't
targeted]{.mark} toward the areas that were hit the most by the
recession, but [even if]{.mark} the [funding were targeted, it]{.mark}
still [might not be stimulative]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, the same
level of [[job poaching]{.mark} from existing jobs [would have
happened]{.mark}; [construction workers tend to be]{.mark} highly
[specialized]{.mark}, and skilled workers rarely suffer from high
unemployment]{.underline}. Many of the areas that were hardest hit by
the recession are in decline because they have been producing goods and
services that are not, and will never be, in great demand. The overall
value added by improving their roads is probably a lot less than that of
new infrastructure in growing areas that might have relatively little
unemployment but do have great demand for more roads, schools, and other
types of long-term infrastructure. As for being temporary --- which
stimulus spending needs to be to work --- what the president will
propose tonight is likely to cost the American people money for a very
long time. [[Infrastructure spending]{.mark} tends to [suffer from
massive cost overruns]{.mark}, waste, fraud, [and
abuse]{.mark}.]{.underline} A comprehensive study examining 20 nations
on five continents ("Underestimating Costs in Public Works Projects:
Error or Lie?" by Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and Søren L.
Buhl) found that [nine out of ten public-works projects come in over
budget]{.underline}. Cost overruns routinely range from 50 to 100
percent of the original estimate. For rail, the average cost is 44.7
percent greater than the estimated cost at the time the decision was
made. For bridges and tunnels, the equivalent figure is 33.8 percent,
for roads 20.4 percent. I should also add that I think it's a mistake to
assume that it is the role of the federal government to pay for roads
and highway expansions. With very few exceptions, most roads, bridges,
and even highways are local projects (state projects at most) by nature.
The federal government shouldn't have anything to do with them.

[[Infrastructure talks are heating up]{.mark} again. In just the last
week, 2020 presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar pitched a
trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal while [the]{.mark} [Trump
administration and Congress continue to flirt with]{.mark} major
[infrastructure packages]{.mark}]{.underline}. This kind of thinking
reflects clear public support for greater investment. [While these
concepts and conversations suggest bipartisanship could deliver
infrastructure reform, [the]{.mark} current [state of]{.mark} national
[politics delivers anything but]{.mark} an infrastructure
[boost]{.mark}]{.underline}. Put bluntly, [[when]{.mark} political
[discord leads to]{.mark} infrastructure [failure]{.mark}, it doesn't
just deepen our distrust of government---[it]{.mark} also [takes]{.mark}
our [economy]{.mark} down [with it]{.mark}.]{.underline} After all, it
was only months ago when fights between House Democrats and the
Republican White House spilled over into our airports. With public
employees and contractors forced to work without pay during the budget
shutdown, it was little surprise that TSA security officers and air
traffic controllers started calling in sick. Then, 35 days after the
shutdown began, LaGuardia Airport closed due to staffing shortages. The
budget fight ended just hours later. While the budget fight may be over
(for now), [[our political system is]{.mark} regularly [causing]{.mark}
less perceptible but more sustained [disruptions to]{.mark} our road,
water, and other [physical networks]{.mark}. We can no longer afford
this kind of unnecessary economic harm due to short-sighted
politics.]{.underline} This [administration's [trade]{.mark} and tariff
[policies serve as]{.mark} a [potent]{.mark} [example]{.mark} of
self-inflicted economic harm. Since the Trump administration applied
tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the cost index for steel mill
products alone rose by almost 14 percent]{.underline} from March 2018 to
January 2019. This directly impacts our state departments of
transportation, their local peers, and water authorities who all rely on
steel and aluminum to construct major capital projects. As Mark Niquette
at Bloomberg reported, states from California to Michigan to Virginia
have already seen certain project costs jump by millions of dollars.
Meanwhile, steel and aluminum manufacturers in the U.S. have been hit
hard by the costs, needing to lay off workers to close budget gaps.
Price increases can act as a fiscal virus, infecting an agency's entire
project pipeline. Since [infrastructure agencies work on tight budgets
and are naturally capital-constrained, there's only so much construction
to go around. So, [when]{.mark} current [projects start costing]{.mark}
significantly [more, agencies have no choice but to delay other
projects]{.mark}. If the [tariffs]{.mark} remain in future years---and
the politically-motivated rhetoric [suggests]{.mark} the president will
keep them---[the effects will only]{.mark} [compound]{.mark} as more
projects are either delayed or outright scrapped.]{.underline} The net
result: lower quality infrastructure than if the country never
instituted the new tariffs. Oddly enough, while the president pushes a
trade war to boost global competitiveness, our domestic infrastructure
will be less prepared to power our economy once the war is over.
[[Politics disrupting]{.mark} our [infrastructure stretches far]{.mark}
beyond tariff fights. For example, the U.S. Department of Transportation
has now twice delayed promised capital grants to local transit agencies.
Similarly, [Congress]{.mark} and the Federal Aviation Administration
[cannot agree on how]{.mark} [to]{.mark} manage and comprehensively
[fund a]{.mark} new satellite-based [air traffic]{.mark} control
[system]{.mark}.]{.underline} They're all guaranteed ways to raise
infrastructure costs in the long-term and reduce public trust today.
That's why these next two- and four-year periods are so important at the
federal level. For the nearly two years remaining on President's Trump
term, there is a major negotiation coming with congressional Democrats
around our next surface transportation bill, if not a larger
infrastructure package. If the two parties can craft a bill that boosts
investment around long-run needs---from resilience to electrification to
digitalization---and reduce tariff impacts in the process, we'll all be
in a better place. [Washington has the chance to give long-run certainty
to our state and local partners, who build all the projects and pay the
majority of costs]{.underline}, anyway. [But if political compromise
doesn't happen---and we have our doubts---the pressure will only be
higher on the next Congress and president to deliver a more
collaborative, bipartisan vision for the country's future]{.underline}.
It's why we're not just watching what happens on the Hill these next
couple years, but why we all should carefully watch the infrastructure
and trade platforms put together by the Democratic candidates for
president. Of course, everyday Americans use infrastructure systems that
remind us what political compromise can deliver. The national highway
network is still one of the world's great capital projects. The
commercial air network is the busiest and safest in the world. We've
grown accustomed to clean water access and are shocked when it fails.
But we have to remember how easily our politics can upend
high-functioning infrastructure[. As the budget fight grounded planes at
one of the busiest airports in our nation's biggest city, stacking up on
the runway, the image said it all. Unnecessary [gridlock]{.mark}
eventually [drags us all down]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"Trump Tax Cuts Did Little To Boost Economic Growth In 2018, Study
Says\" Published: may 29 19 DOA: 7-22-19 wall-e
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/29/trump-tax-cuts-did-little-to-boost-economic-growth-in-2018-study-says.html

The U.S. economy's [[strong]{.mark} 2018 [performance]{.mark} [happened
without]{.mark} much health from [the]{.mark} massive [tax cut]{.mark}
President Donald Trump ushered through the previous year]{.underline},
according to a study released this week. An in-depth look by [the
nonpartisan Congressional Research Service indicated that not only did
the [rollbacks in]{.mark} business and [personal rates have little
macro]{.mark} impact, [but]{.mark} they also [delivered the most
benefits to]{.mark} corporations and [the rich, with little boost to
wages]{.mark}]{.underline}. In all, GDP rose 2.9% for the full calendar
year, the best performance since the financial crisis. But that came in
an economy already poised to move higher, economists Jane Gravelle and
Donald Marples wrote. "[On the whole, the growth effects \[from the
cuts\] tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the
economy," the report said. "Although examining the growth rates cannot
indicate the effects of the tax cut on GDP, it does tend to rule out
very large effects in the near term.]{.underline}" Trump had touted the
cuts as a key step toward generating GDP growth of at least 3%. The
legislation, passed in late 2017, slashed corporate tax rates from 35%
to 21%, reduced the number of brackets, lowered rates for many
individual payers, and doubled the standard deduction in an effort to
make most income tax-exempt for the lowest earners. Employment continued
to boom in 2018 and average hourly earnings have in recent months passed
3% on a year-over-year basis for the first time since the recovery began
in 2009. However, the [economists said [wage gains could not be tracked
to the tax cuts]{.mark}. "[This]{.mark} growth [is]{.mark} [smaller than
overall growth]{.mark} in labor compensation [and indicates]{.mark} that
ordinary [workers had]{.mark} very [little growth in wage
rates]{.mark},]{.underline}" the economists wrote. [The study indicated
that the tax changes contributed only marginally to the overall economic
economic gains --- maybe 0.3% of a "feedback effect]{.underline}." The
economists say that for the tax cuts to pay for themselves, as Trump has
promised, GDP would have to rise by 6.7%. "The initial effect of a
demand side is likely to be reflected in increased consumption and the
data indicate little growth in consumption in 2018," the report said.
"Much of the tax cut was directed at businesses and higher-income
individuals who are less likely to spend. Fiscal stimulus is limited in
an economy that is at or near full employment." At the same time, tax
receipts from 2018 indicate that corporations got an even bigger break
than expected. [While [the]{.mark} Congressional [Budget Office]{.mark}
had [forecast]{.mark} a \$94 billion break that still would have
generated \$[243 billion in]{.mark} corporate [revenues]{.mark},
[the]{.mark} actual [total]{.mark} [was]{.mark} \$205 billion, or [16%
lower]{.mark} than projected]{.underline}.

#### Trump cuts hurt most Americans -- they only help the elite

The 2017 U.S. tax reform became law just over a year ago, but its
effects on economic performance, public finances, and individual
households are still being debated. We won't be able to resolve this
debate with hard data for years. But there are tools economists can use
to make estimates. That's what I did in a recent paper. [To estimate the
macroeconomic and welfare effects of the tax bill, I used what's called
[a dynamic general equilibrium model]{.mark}, which [simulates]{.mark}
how the whole [economy]{.mark} will [change]{.mark} over time. The model
I used was calibrated to replicate the household income distribution in
the U.S.,]{.underline} giving us a more granular picture of how the tax
cuts will likely affect different segments of society. The results
suggest that the 2017 tax cuts will lead to increases in investment,
wages, and output, although the welfare gains are quite unevenly
distributed across households. [Despite efficiency gains overall, the
[poorest households]{.mark} can [expect to be worse off because
of]{.mark} the [tax reform]{.mark}. The richest households will fare
better, in large part because they own corporate stocks.]{.underline}
You can think of the model as something like a virtual world. In this
virtual world, the economy consists of a continuum of households that
differ in their labor productivity, income, and wealth.
[[Households]{.mark} [also engage in]{.mark} some [precautionary
saving]{.mark}. There's a representative firm hires which hires people
(labor) and decides how much to invest to maximize shareholder value.
The government taxes payrolls, personal income, and corporate profits.
[The tax revenue is]{.mark} [distributed]{.mark} back [to]{.mark} the
[households via]{.mark} lump-[sum transfers]{.mark}. Running [a
simulation sparks]{.mark} a [series of changes in this virtual
world]{.mark}. Here's what we see when we introduce an unexpected and
permanent tax cut on the effective tax rate on business
profits]{.underline}. (In the model, the effective [corporate tax rate
falls from 27.5% to 21.3%,]{.underline} an estimate derived from work by
Harvard professors Robert Barro and Jason Furman.) First, because of
higher after-tax profits, long-run investment increases by one
percentage point of the baseline GDP. Higher investment increases labor
demand, which then pushes up wages by 1.3% two years in. [[This wage
increase takes two]{.mark} [years]{.mark} because of an increase in
labor supply and the lagged response of the capital stock. The increase
in investment and employment leads to a GDP growth of 0.4% the year the
tax rate is cut. After about a decade, GDP is 1.6% higher than it would
have been without the cut. So far, so good. But the [economic
gains]{.mark} here [are not even]{.mark}ly distributed. Overall,
aggregate welfare gains for the whole economy add up to the equivalent
of a one-off payment of 3.3%]{.underline} of annual GDP. But households
in the richest quintile can expect a gain equivalent to a one-off
payment of 4.2% of annual GDP. [Households in the poorest income
quintile may face a welfare loss equivalent to a one-off debit of 1.8%
of annual GDP.]{.underline} Why are the gains so uneven? In the world of
the model, I assume that government [[revenue losses]{.mark} (which is
what tax cuts are) [will result in spending cuts, and]{.mark} that
[these]{.mark} cuts are evenly spread across households]{.underline}.
[This means that the transfers that households receive are all cut by
the same amount, no matter the household's income level. As a result,
[despite]{.mark} the [long-run increase]{.mark} in wages, the
[poor]{.mark}est [households are worse off]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
fact, many middle-class households would also fail to benefit. Under the
assumption of evenly-spread spending cuts, only the two richest
quintiles benefit from the 2017 tax bill. This is mainly explained by
the ownership of corporate stocks: the higher the income, the higher the
ownership of corporate stocks. [When you cut corporate taxes, stocks
tend to go up. But only stock-owners can benefit from a higher stock
value.]{.underline} Of course, it's possible that in the real world,
government spending cuts won't be evenly distributed; politicians could
decide to aim cuts more at the poor or at the wealthy. It's even
possible that the government won't cut spending at all---historically,
only out-of-power politicians seem to seriously bemoan government debt.
So in reality, the welfare distribution could be different than the one
estimated here depending on the policy decisions made regarding the
deficit. (Alternatively, politicians could decide to raise taxes and
avoid spending cuts; this would wipe out at least some of the efficiency
gains of the 2017 reform.) Still, based on my research, [the most likely
outcome is that the poorest households will face a future in which they
are going to be worse off than they would have been without the 2017 tax
law.]{.underline} That is, unless policy-makers decide to get
redistributive, and start transferring income gains from the richest to
the poorest. And that's probably not the outcome the architects of tax
reform had in mind.

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- Infrastructure

#### Turn -- infrastructure hurts the economy more than it helps -- cost ratios overhyped. 

**[Hanke 17]{.underline}**( Steve hanke - professor of applied economics
at john hopkins. \"Forget the Hype: Public Infrastructure Generates
Waste, Fraud and Abuse,\" Published: 8-31-17 DOA: 7-22-19
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/forget-hype-public-infrastructure-generates-waste-fraud-abuse

[[President Trump]{.mark} has [jumped on this infrastructure
bandwagon]{.mark}]{.underline}. He is proposing a \$1 trillion public
works program. Following the script of the public works advocates (read:
big spenders), Trump has lifted a page from President Obama's Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA). The CEA's 2016 Annual Report contains a long
chapter titled "The Economic Benefits of Investing in U.S.
Infrastructure." That title alone tells us a great deal. [Infrastructure
[spending advocates focus on the alleged benefits,]{.mark} which are
often wildly inflated, while ignoring, downplaying, or distorting, the
cost estimates]{.underline}. This was clearly on display in an op-ed,
"These are the Policies to Restore Growth to America," which appeared in
the Financial Times (12-13 November 2016). It was penned by none other
than Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived adviser of President Trump. In
it, "The Mooch" asserted that infrastructure spending "has an estimated
economic multiplier effect of 1.6 times, meaning Mr Trump's plan would
have a net reductive effect on long-term deficits." This multiplier
analysis is exactly the same one used by President Obama's CEA to
justify public works spending. The idea that a dollar of government
spending creates more than a dollar's worth of output is nothing new.
Indeed, the multiplier originated in an article that appeared in a 1931
issue of the Economic Journal. The article was written by R. F. Kahn,
who was one of John Maynard Keynes' favorite students and closest
collaborators. Since Kahn's 1931 article, the multiplier has become an
inherent part of Keynesian theory. [The numerical values of the
multiplier are not only sensitive to the assumptions employed, but also
subject to misuse in the artificial inflation of benefits.]{.underline}
Once public works are installed, the hot air comes out of their alleged
benefits. [[These projects are poorly maintained, and]{.mark} users are
[often not]{.mark} [charged for what they use]{.mark}, or they are
charged prices set well below the relevant costs incurred. Water is a
classic case.]{.underline} For example, the [accompanying chart shows
that, on average, 34% of the water delivered to water systems is either
stolen or leaks out of the distribution systems]{.underline}. In
Nigeria, 70% is leaked or stolen. So, it's hard to take seriously the
claims that billions of dollars are required to develop more
water-resource capacity when much of the water produced in existing
systems leaks away. Adjusted for leaks and thefts, the alleged benefits
for many new projects, which have been inflated by multipliers, wither
away to almost nothing. Non-Revenue Water (Leaks and Thefts) When we
turn to the cost side of the ledger, something infrastructure advocates
prefer to keep from the public's view, [we find that
[infrastructure]{.mark} [projects are always subject to]{.mark} cost
[overruns]{.mark}. [While]{.mark} the [projects might look
"good]{.mark}" on paper, [reality is]{.mark} a [different]{.mark} story.
Detailed studies show that the average ratios of actual costs to
estimated costs for public works projects in the U.S. typically range
from 1.25 to over 2.0.]{.underline} In addition to cost overruns, the
[[financing]{.mark} of infrastructure [requires]{.mark} the [imposition
of taxes]{.mark}, [and taxes impose costs beyond]{.mark} the amount of
[revenue raised]{.mark}.]{.underline} The exce[ss [burdens]{.mark} of
taxation [include "deadweight" distortions]{.mark} and enforcement and
compliance costs. In short, it costs more than a dollar to finance a
dollar in government spending. The best estimates indicate that, on
average, it costs between \$1.50 to \$1.60 to raise a dollar in tax
revenue.]{.underline} Taking proper account of cost overruns and the
costs of collecting taxes, one wonders if there are any public works
projects that could justify federal financing, let alone financing to
the tune of \$1 trillion. Welcome to the wonderful world of
infrastructure waste, fraud and abuse.

will be, ask yourself who were the winners and losers during the lead up

With tax cuts now a done deal, [[Republicans are turning to regulatory
reform]{.mark} to give economic growth a further boost. [There, they may
find]{.mark} more [bipartisan]{.mark} support]{.underline}. Past reforms
of airlines, rail, and trucking regulation were, after all, set in
motion by Democrats. Today there is significant Democratic support for
reform of financial regulation, especially for smaller community banks.
Overregulated small businesses can be found in every congressional
district, red or blue. But [while regulatory reform could provide a big
boost if it is done right, [indiscriminate deregulation could do]{.mark}
more [harm]{.mark} than good.]{.underline} Blanket Deregulation Won't
Help Many conservatives and libertarians seem to think the only good
regulation is a dead regulation. If that were true, it should be
possible to quantify regulation and measure the harm it does. However,
attempts to do so have not been particularly successful. Consider the
[[regulatory freedom indexes]{.mark} published by the Heritage
Foundation and the Cato Institute, which rank countries on a scale where
a high score [indicates]{.mark} greater [freedom]{.mark} from regulation
and a [low score indicates]{.mark} a [greater]{.mark} regulatory
[burden]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Those scores correlate positively with
GDP per capita and with broader measures of prosperity, such as the
Social Progress Index and the Legatum Index of Prosperity. That tells us
that countries with less regulation are, on average, richer and better
off, but does it really support the notion that too much regulation is
holding back the U.S. economy?]{.underline} A closer look at the data
shows that the United States already ranks high on the world scale of
regulatory freedom. Its score is even better than would be expected,
given its GDP. On the Heritage index, the United States ranks fourth out
of 131 countries, behind only New Zealand, Denmark, and Australia.
According to Cato, it ranks sixth out of 143 countries, with only one
OECD country, New Zealand, doing better. Given how lightly regulated the
U.S. already is by these measures, it is hard to think that one or two
more steps up the regulatory freedom rankings would be transformational.
Furthermore, although [[prosperous countries]{.mark} do tend to [have
higher regulatory freedom scores]{.mark}, [correlation is not
causation]{.mark}. Other factors are at work that jointly influence both
prosperity and regulatory freedom]{.underline}. In previous research, I
have used some of those factors to compile a quality-of-government
index, based on data regarding the rule of law, protection of property
rights, judicial independence, procedural justice, and freedom from
corruption. I found that quality of government is a statistically
significant predictor of GDP and of broader prosperity indexes. At the
same time, [[when]{.mark} I [controlled for quality of
government]{.mark}, [regulatory freedom lost]{.mark} its predictive
[power]{.mark}. I interpret this to mean that [quality of government is
the]{.mark} real [cause of economic]{.mark} and social
[prosperity]{.mark}. Regulatory freedom, at least as it is measured by
the Heritage and Cato indexes, is not an end in itself. Rather, it is an
outcome of good government]{.underline} in the more general sense.

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- H1B

The number of H-1B visas given out by the United States government hit
the congressionally mandated cap after just four days, but there\'s
evidence [that [interest from foreign job seekers may be
**waning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Data from job site Indeed show that
searches by job seekers for H-1B visas declined year-over-year for the
first time in three years, according to Valerie Rodden, an economic
research analyst at the employment website. "There is a seasonal trend
of searches peaking in February and bottoming out in April," she said
"but [this year [searches]{.mark} have [continue]{.mark}d [to
decline]{.mark} \[since April\] showing us that job seekers are less
inclined to search for H-1B opportunities than they have \[been\] in the
past]{.underline}." For the first half of 2017, [**[Canada was the most
searched destination]{.mark}** for H-1B visa jobseekers]{.underline} on
the site, with 44% of traffic directed there, 10% to Australia, 5% to
the United Kingdom and 5% to China. This could be a problem for the tech
sector. While the [[Trump]{.mark} Administration [is pushing companies
to \"hire American]{.mark}\", [there]{.mark} simply [aren't
enough]{.mark} qualified [workers]{.mark} from the United States [to
fill]{.mark} open [positions]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2015, there were
nearly 10 times more computer science jobs than students graduating with
computer science degrees. [[Job]{.mark} [seekers]{.mark} requiring
sponsorship [showed five]{.mark}s [times the]{.mark} concentration of
[interest in tech positions]{.mark} compared to the average U.S. job
seeker]{.underline}. On Indeed, software engineering positions
specifically saw nearly 16 times greater concentration from H-1B job
seekers. Java developer and data scientist jobs saw 14 times and 13
times greater concentration, respectively. As is the case with much of
U.S. immigration policy, the H-1B visa program is complex. It involves
the Department of Labor, the Department of Homeland Security and the
State Department. And each of those agencies track a different part of
the H-1B process, which has an annual cap of 85,000 for new approvals.
[[Annual totals]{.mark} almost [always surpass that cap]{.mark}
[because]{.mark} H-1B [holders]{.mark} are allowed to [renew their
visa]{.mark} for three years after being approved]{.underline}. That
means what looks like growth in the number of employees working on H-1B
visas accounts for foreign workers already in the U.S. who are renewing
their visas as well as employees at organizations exempt from the
mandated cap, such as religious groups. The largest number of H-1B visas
go to workers in the tech sector and these jobs primarily get filled by
Indian applicants. More than 70% of all H-1B visas over the last 10
years went to Indian applicants working mostly these computer science or
IT positions, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration
Services.

On Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services [announced the

applications [in 2017]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Last year marked
the first time the number fell below 200,000 applications since 2014.

reserved for master\'s degree holders. This is the sixth year the

factors]{.mark} could [have contributed]{.mark} to the application drop,
[including uncertainty]{.mark} about the visa\'s future. While H-1B
visas are used to help fill a skills gap in the US, some critics \--
including the administration of President [Trump]{.mark} \-- [have
voiced concerns about abuse]{.mark} of the program]{.underline}. In some
cases, [[outsourcing]{.mark} firms [flood the system with
applicants]{.mark}, obtaining visas for foreign workers and then
contracting them out to tech companies]{.underline}. American jobs are
sometimes replaced in the process, critics argue. The [[Trump]{.mark}
administration [has taken]{.mark} some [steps to crack down on companies
that get visas for foreign workers]{.mark} and farm them out to
employers. USCIS issued a policy memo in February noting it will require
more information about H-1B workers\' employment to ensure the workers
are doing what they were hired for.]{.underline}

Apart from technicalities, [lawyers]{.underline} have [noted an increase
in **detailed requests for evidence**]{.underline}. Some of the new
questions fit with Trump's 2017 Executive Order called "Buy American and
Hire American," which directed the Department of Homeland Security to
find ways to make sure specialty work visas are awarded only to the most
highly skilled and highest-paid foreign workers, to fill jobs that
couldn't be filled by an American. To some, the increased scrutiny of
work visas is welcome. In particular, the H-1B visa category has often
been the subject of controversy. Intended for high-level workers with
specialized skills, it has been used to outsource ordinary jobs. In
2014, for example, Disney laid off about 250 long-time workers in
computer jobs so that they could replace them with workers flown in from
India. The Americans were required to train their replacements before
they left. A federal court found that Disney did not violate any laws
and the case was eventually dropped, but Republicans have often pointed
to similar cases to call for tougher oversight of foreign worker
programs. "It's almost like it's a subclass of employee that they can
take advantage of and can work them extra hard for smaller pay," said
Rennie Sawade, the communications chair of the Washington Alliance of
Technology Workers. He has experienced increased competition in his own
search for jobs in the tech industry and in that of his son, who is 24
and has an associate degree in robotics and computer networking but is
still struggling to find work. "These visas should be used for what they
are intended for, so you definitely need more scrutiny in how they are
being used." But lawyers argue the [stepped-up examinations]{.underline}
go beyond what's required to assess an immigrant's eligibility and [seem
intended to simply make the process **more burdensome**]{.underline} for
all immigrants. Under Trump, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} extra layer of
[[questions has not been limited to H-1B]{.underline}]{.mark} cases, but
**[applied to all]{.underline}** types of work visas, family-based green
cards and humanitarian **[[cases]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The extra
questions are also directed toward people who have lived and worked in
the U.S. for more than a decade and are applying to extend their visas.

experts]{.underline} in his field and evidence of his awards and
publications. Feist, [his lawyer]{.underline}, said she [felt
certain]{.underline} his petition for a green card under
[the]{.underline} "outstanding professor" [category would sail
through]{.underline}. Read More Behind the Criminal Immigration Law:

of quibbles: [[The professor had published]{.mark} frequently in his
field, [but **was he cited**]{.mark} **often
[enough]{.mark}**]{.underline}? He had won awards, but the reviewing
officer didn't think they were truly prestigious. The professor had
served on panels and presented at conferences, but those were not really
sufficient to prove influence, the officer wrote. "[This is just one
example]{.underline} [of]{.underline} pretty [typical aggressive
requests]{.underline} [for]{.underline} additional [evidence that I'm
seeing that are far outside]{.underline} of [the norm that I've
seen]{.underline} in the past 17 years," Feist said. Michael Cataliotti,
an immigration lawyer in New York, recalled a case in which he printed
and attached emails between a physicist and the editors of peer-reviewed
journals, to demonstrate the physicist had served as a reviewer for each
of them. Because the email was printed from his work computer,
Cataliotti's name appeared at the top of the paper. This seemed to
confuse the USCIS official handling the case. "The document has been
altered, and as such, is inadmissible," the official wrote. Other
examples show an overly strict reading of the rules, sometimes applied
incorrectly. Courtney Morgan-Greene, an immigration attorney in
California, said the USCIS tried to deny a religious worker's request
for a visa extension because she had taken some time off from her job
--- in order to give birth, and then to mourn the death of her child
after 11 months. The response from the agency began, "While USCIS
sympathizes with the death of the beneficiary's baby," and went on to
deny the case based on the time she took off. Morgan-Greene emailed the
quote to ProPublica. USCIS policy allows breaks in employment "such as
sick leave, pregnancy leave, spousal care and vacation as long as they
do not exceed two years." Morgan-Greene said her client's two periods of
leave combined did not add up to two years. "Not only is the decision
incorrect as a matter of law, it shocks the conscience," she said.
[[Employers are]{.mark} just as [frustrated]{.mark} as immigrants trying

cases, [certified that no]{.underline} qualified U.S. [workers are

Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said
examples of H-1B misuse are "highly concerning," but she said that
there's no clear data to prove how widespread it is. "We know there are
a lot of legitimate employers that use this program as well," she said.
Pierce said targeted approaches --- such as limiting contractors from
hiring H-1B workers or going after companies that mainly depend on H-1B
workers --- would be better solutions than a blanket approach making it
difficult for all companies to hire foreign workers. But Trump has made
it clear that he would like to see a reduction in all immigration. "One
thing really unique about President Trump is he views not just illegal
immigration, but legal immigration through the context of it being a
security threat and an economic threat to the United States," Pierce
said. [**[Even when cases are]{.mark}** ultimately

[[Workers]{.mark} **stuck [in limbo]{.mark}**]{.underline} have told her

SPIKE UNDER TRUMP\" Published: 4-25-19 DOA: 7-23-19 wall-e
https://www.wired.com/story/h-1b-visa-rejections-spike-under-trump/

IN NOVEMBER OF 2018, Usha and her husband Sudhir received the news they
never expected: the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
declined to extend Usha's work visa, meaning the couple and their
daughter would have 180 days to leave the country before the US
government would consider their presence to be unlawful. The notice hit
the whole family like a punch to the gut. Eight years before, Usha and
her daughter had moved from India to New Jersey to join Sudhir, who was
already living in the United States, pursuing a master's degree in
computer science. Both Usha and Sudhir landed jobs as quality assurance
analysts for IT outsourcing firms, relying on so-called H-1B visas,
which are reserved for specialty occupations. Before coming to the US,
Usha had earned a bachelor\'s in math and physics, and a master\'s in
political science. They'd bought a home, paid their taxes, and enrolled
their daughter, who's now 16, in school. Usha had been approved in the
early stages of the green card process, and had successfully extended
her H-1B visa twice before. Nothing had changed about her job, her
skillset, or her educational background since the family started their
lives in the United States. And yet, when she tried to renew her visa a
third time last year, the government denied her, arguing that her job
was not considered a specialty after all. "I'm not doing anything
different now," says Usha, who agreed to speak on the condition that
WIRED wouldn't publish her last name. "What makes them say today that I
do not have a specialty?" [Usha is one of [thousands]{.mark} of current
US tech workers who [have had their visas suddenly rejected]{.mark}
thanks to new policies implemented by President Trump's
administration]{.underline}. Since 1990, [the H-1B program has enabled
US companies to employ foreign workers on a temporary basis for jobs
that "require the theoretical and practical application of a body of
highly specialized knowledge.]{.underline}" These visas are reservedfor
people with at least a bachelor's degree in their specialty, or some
form of equivalent training, and they're intended as a backstop for
employers who can't find Americans to fill the position. The government
issues just 65,000 of these visas per year, with another 20,000 set
aside for people who have gotten a master's degree or higher in the US.
Due to the high demand for tech skills, H-1B visas have always been both
coveted and competitive. In 2018 alone, companies filed419,000 petitions
for both new and continuing visas. But [[over]{.mark} the last [two
years]{.mark}, new research finds, [denial rates]{.mark} across both
categories [have spiked]{.mark} dramatically]{.underline}. According to
a recent analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy, a
nonprofit that studies immigration, [[the]{.mark} [denial rate]{.mark}
for applicants like Usha who are trying to extend their visas [grew from
4 percent]{.mark} in 2016 to 12 percent in 2018; the rate climbed even
higher, [to 18 percent]{.mark},]{.underline} through the first quarter
of 2019. When it comes to new employment, meanwhile, USCIS has more than
doubled the share of petitions it turns down, from 10 percent in 2016 to
24 percent in 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, the denial rate was 32
percent[. [This]{.mark} [is despite a steady decrease in]{.mark} the
total [number of new applications]{.mark} under President Trump. \"I
think the most striking thing is the [change in denial]{.mark} rates
[has happened without]{.mark} any [new]{.mark} law or
[regulation]{.mark} that many people feel would be necessary to have
allowed an agency to deny so many applications in a legal
manner]{.underline},\" says Stuart Anderson, executive director of the
National Foundation for American Policy and a former staffer on the
Senate Immigration Subcommittee. Instead, [the [Trump]{.mark}
administration has [enacted these changes]{.mark} solely [through
executive power]{.mark}.]{.underline} While campaigning to become
president, Donald Trump promised to overhaul the H-1B visa program,
which he argued made it too easy for businesses (including his own) to
hire foreign workers and pay them less money than American ones. During
his first months in office, President Trump signed the so-called "Buy
American, Hire American" executive order, which sought to prioritize
visas for the "most-skilled or highest-paid" workers. That order has led
USCIS to look more critically at third-party outsourcing firms and
reassess whether certain work and educational experience really does
constitute a specialty. Later on in 2017, the agency also instructed
officials not to defer to prior decisions when assessing whether to
extend someone\'s visa, reversing policies that existed under previous
administrations. Taken together[, these changes have led to an uptick in
denials across all of the top H-1B employers, including tech giants like
Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook]{.underline}, as well as
top outsourcing firms like Infosys and Cognizant.

President Trump on Thursday will unveil a plan to overhaul parts of the
nation's immigration system that would impose new security measures at
the border and significantly increase the educational and skills
requirements for people allowed to migrate to the United States. [[The
proposal]{.mark}, senior administration officials said on Wednesday,

[allowed immigrants to bring]{.mark} their [spouses]{.mark}]{.underline}
and children to live with them, the officials said. [In its place,
[the]{.mark} new [plan would provide opportunities]{.mark} for
immigrants who have specific skills or job offers to work in the United

serve as a central part of Mr. Trump's re-election campaign message.
Working with him was Stephen Miller, the president's top immigration
adviser, but the [[plan falls short of]{.mark} the more [extreme

reasons, [the broad outlines of the plan described on Wednesday are
certain to be unpopular with lawmakers on both sides of the

that is a preoccupation of Mr. Trump's and vehemently opposed by
Democrats, and upends family-based migration in ways that Democrats and
immigrant advocates have long opposed. And it contains no provision for
providing legal status to people brought to the United States as
children, known as Dreamers, or other undocumented immigrants.

[The US\' curb on H-1B visas]{.underline} might be bad news for Indians
wishing to settle there, but it [might turn out to be a golden
opportunity for the Indian government]{.underline}. For officials, [the
decline in international placements means more of the top talent staying
back in the country and prevent brain drain]{.underline}. During
1999-2015, there was a 225% increase in migration to the US. The H-1B
program and its significance for India The H-1B visa program allows
foreign skilled workers to work in the US. In 2016, 72% of H-1B visas
approved went to Indians. The H-1B visa has a three-year validity and
can be renewed for another three years. If approved for Green Card,
workers can stay on using extensions, but Indians often have to wait
years considering the massive backlog and per-country cap. The Trump
administration\'s anti-immigrant policies Trump has continuously
tightened conditions for the program: modifications being considered (or
approved) include upping eligibility requirements, boosting minimum
salary from \$60,000 to \$90,000, and disallowing spouses from working
on the H-4 dependent visas. [They are also considering a proposal to end
extensions for H-1B visa holders whose applications for Green Cards have
been accepted, which could force 7,50,000 Indians to return
home.]{.underline} Not just Indians, but American firms to be affected
too Reactions have mostly been of worry. Though some like Anjani Kovvur
of Hyderabad are certain their sons/relatives will get good
opportunities in India, most appear anxious. Many are looking at options
other than the US; Canada is emerging as an appealing proposition, said
35-year-old Darshan Srinivasan. But considering American companies would
also be affected, many think big firms will resist the move. Despite
increase in migration, a fall in remittances This brings to the fore the
issue of brain drain, a significant matter for India. \"If graduates
from IITs, NITs and other top institutions work here, it\'s good for
India,\" an official said. Two main factors that lure Indians are better
education and higher wages. However, [despite the increase in migration,
remittances have fallen from 4.2% in 2008 to 3.2% in 2015]{.underline}.
[India needs to change its conditions to prevent brain
drain]{.underline} For Indian officials, this is a way to prevent brain
drain, but some measures are necessary. Quality of education has to be
improved, and more importantly, the additional workforce has to be
absorbed in the country. [The effects are already being
seen]{.underline} though: according to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, [the
number of Indians in the US looking for jobs back here has increased
over tenfold]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- R&D CP

#### Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its funding for science R&D 

#### That solves leadership

**[Khan 19]{.underline}** (Dr. Mehmood Khan is PepsiCo's Vice Chairman
and Chief Scientific Officer, Head of Global R&D.­ 04-18-2019,
"Maintaining US Leadership in Science and Technology,"
<https://insight.ieeeusa.org/articles/maintaining-u-s-leadership-in-science-and-technology/>)

Given the [[profound impact of]{.mark} science and [tech]{.mark}nology
[on U.S. prosperity]{.mark}, standards of living, national security,
modern society [and geopolitical standing]{.mark}, every American should
be concerned with the nation's ability to lead in science, technology
and innovation.]{.underline}

More than any country in history, [the United States has been the
greatest driver and beneficiary of technology, innovation and a vibrant
entrepreneurial spirit. In the 19th century, entrepreneurship and
innovations surrounding agriculture, rail, oil, steel and electricity
turned the United States into an industrial and economic powerhouse,
laying the foundation for a manufacturing sector that provided middle
class jobs and a higher standard of living for millions of
Americans.]{.underline}

In the 20th century, American inventions and advancements in vehicle and
aircraft technology revolutionized transportation and changed society
and the geographic face of the country. American-born digital
technologies unleashed a revolutionary new age of computing,
communications and information mobility, disrupting industries and
business models, changing society and culture around the world, and
creating enormous new wealth. This continuum of innovation has delivered
prosperity and rising standards of living to Americans, and propelled
the United States to global leadership.

As we enter the third decade of the 21st Century, a new urgency, a new
innovation reality, [[a new imperative faces the nation]{.mark}.
Notwithstanding a currently robust economy -- rising and strong
economic, productivity and job growth; historically low unemployment;
wage increases; an improved tax environment; etc. -- [the Council on
Competitiveness believes U.S. leadership in technology and long-term
competitiveness is under threat]{.mark}. This potential demands the
urgent attention of our nation's leaders, and a focused examination of
our capabilities, investments and policies related to science,
technology development and innovation.]{.underline}

The Case for Ongoing Investment

While the United States is enjoying an economic upswing on many fronts,
U.S. leadership in technology is under renewed threat. In 1960, the
United States dominated global research and development (R&D),
accounting for 69 percent share of the world's R&D investment. [The
United States could drive developments in technology globally by virtue
of the size of its investment]{.underline}. Today, we have evolved into
a multipolar science and technology world. As other nations have
increased their R&D investments and capacity for innovation, [[the U.S.
share of global R&D expenditures has dropped to 28 percent in
2016]{.underline}]{.mark}, diminishing the U.S. dominance and leverage
over the direction of technology advancement. [At the same time, China
has risen to the account for a quarter of global R&D
spending.]{.underline}

In addition, [[America's lead in venture capital is shrinking, further
diminishing its role as a driver of]{.mark} technology and [innovation
globally]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1992, U.S. investors represented 97
percent of the \$2 billion in venture finance, and accounted for about
three-quarters just a decade ago. However, in 2017, U.S. investors led
44 percent of a record \$154 billion in venture finance, with Asian
investors (with China leading) accounting for 40 percent. Moreover,
while the absolute level of venture capital coming to the United States
has increased substantially, the U.S. share of the growing global pool
of venture capital -- which has increased more than 200 percent since
2010 -- has dropped sharply from 95 percent in the early 1990s to about
half in 2017.

[While traditional U.S. competitors -- such as Germany, Japan, France
and the U.K. -- continue to be strong R&D performers working at the
leading edge of technology, many emerging economies seek to follow the
path of the world's innovators, transform to knowledge-based economies,
and drive their economic growth with technology and
innovation]{.underline}. A growing number of emerging economies are
establishing government organizations and ministries focused on
technology and innovation, adopting innovation-based growth strategies,
boosting government R&D investments, and developing research parks and
regional centers of innovation. Some of these economies are also working
to increase their production of scientists and engineers. These actions
are raising technology and development capabilities and innovation
capacity around the world.

A nation's R&D intensity expressed as R&D expenditures as a percentage
of GDP provides another gauge of national R&D performance. In this
measure, the U.S. position globally has lagged in recent years, as other
countries have expanded the range and scope of their R&D activities.
Notably, South Korea, one of the world's largest R&D performers and
another formidable U.S. competitor, ranks at the top in this metric.

[At the same time, [key U.S. science and tech]{.mark}nology
[infrastructure is eroding]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much like roads, rails
and power plants were essential for the Industrial Age, infrastructure
that supports knowledge creation and technology development is vital for
the 21st century knowledge economy and U.S. success in innovation-based
global competition. This includes laboratories, research and technology
demonstration centers, supercomputers, test-beds, wind tunnels,
propulsion and combustion facilities, simulators, accelerators and other
user facilities.

America's national laboratory system is considered a distinctive and
globally unique competitive asset. But, across the system, core
scientific and technological capabilities are potentially at risk due to
deficient and degrading infrastructure and repair hamstrung by chronic
underfunding, and maintenance backlogs in the hundreds of millions of
dollars.

New Disrupters

At the same time that competition in technology and innovation is rising
around the world, and [[U.S. tech]{.mark}nology [leadership is under
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}, we are witnessing accelerated advancement
of the greatest revolutions in science and technology; a new phase of
the digital revolution characterized by vast deployment of sensors, the
internet of things, artificial intelligence (AI), and the big data
tsunami; biotechnology and gene editing; nanotechnology; and autonomous
systems. Each of these technologies has numerous applications that
cut-across industry sectors, society and human activities. [Each is
revolutionary; each is game-changing in its own right. But they are now
colliding and converging on the global economy and society
simultaneously, with profound implications for U.S. economic and
national security.]{.underline}

These technologies are crucial drivers of productivity and economic
growth, altering the patterns of society and many dimensions of everyday
life. For countries and companies, the ability to leverage these
technologies for economic impact is fundamental to their competitiveness
and economic success.

In addition to their economic potential, [[these technologies could
solve many of the world's critical challenges surrounding areas such as
health, energy and sustainability, clean water and the global food
supply]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Trump recently passed an Executive Order -- but it didn't have enough funding. Passing the plan is key to AI dominance and curtailing China

2019).](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-02-14/pdf/2019-02544.pdf)

On February 11, 2019, President Trump issued an executive order aimed at
establishing America's place as the global leader in artificial
intelligence technology. Largely following up on the recommendations of
the [2018 White House Summit on Artificial Intelligence for American
Industry](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Summary-Report-of-White-House-AI-Summit.pdf),
it marks the launch of the [American AI
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/accelerating-americas-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/).

Entitled "[Maintaining American Leadership in A]{.underline}rtificial
[I]{.underline}ntelligence," the executive order outlines five main
directives:

Federal investment: Federal agencies should establish AI research and
development as an agency priority and develop budgets accordingly. The
agencies should also explore opportunities to collaborate with academia
and the private sector.

Federal resources: Agencies should identify ways to enable the greater
AI research community to use federal resources in the form of data,
models, and computing resources, while preserving security and
confidentiality.

Guidelines for regulation: The Office of Management and Budget and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology should establish
guidelines and standards to enable the regulation of AI technologies,
with the aim of enabling innovation while protecting privacy and
national security interests.

Preparing the workforce: Agencies that provide educational grants and
fellowships to students and researchers should consider AI as a priority
area, giving preference to American citizens when possible.

Protecting American AI: The National Security Advisor should develop an
action plan to protect AI technology critical to American economic and
national security against strategic competitors and adversarial nations.

Implementation of these tasks will be largely coordinated by the
National Science and Technology Committee [Select Committee on
Artificial Intelligence](https://www.epic.org/SelectCommitteeonAI.pdf).

Artificial intelligence, a term that has no agreed-upon definition, can
be described broadly as software that makes decisions that typically
require human judgment. A recent [Brookings
Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-the-world/)
report predicted that broad adoption of AI will "transform the world." A
[PwC
study](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html)
predicts that [[AI could add over \$15 trillion to global GDP by
2030.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[American [companies like
Alphabet](https://www.economist.com/business/2017/12/07/google-leads-in-the-race-to-dominate-artificial-intelligence)
are generally considered the current world leaders in AI
tech]{.mark}nology, [but China is aggressively seeking to
[overtake](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/3/16007736/china-us-ai-artificial-intelligence)
those]{.mark} American [companies]{.mark}.]{.underline} After the
[Chinese
government](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/china-artificial-intelligence.html)
announced an ambitious plan in July 2017 to be the world leader in AI by
2030, [some American
[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/technology/china-trump-artificial-intelligence.html)
[[called for the Trump administration to chart its own path
forward]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The executive order appears to be [a
step](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-15/artificial-intelligence-trump-s-smart-american-ai-initiative)
in that
[direction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trump-administration-gives-a-needed-prod-on-artificial-intelligence/2019/02/18/5661a65e-30a5-11e9-8ad3-9a5b113ecd3c_story.html),
but many worry that it [will not be
enough](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/4-experts-respond-to-trumps-executive-order-on-ai).
One concern is that [[the order did not provide [new research
funds](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/business/ai-artificial-intelligence-trump.html)]{.mark}.
The order directs federal agencies to allocate money towards AI but
[does not
indicate](https://www.recode.net/2019/2/13/18222433/trump-executive-order-ai-explained)
where that money is to come from.]{.underline}

Another concern is that [the order [lacks details on
implementation](https://about.bgov.com/news/trump-issues-an-american-ai-initiative-thats-short-on-details-funding/)]{.underline}.
Much of the order is dependent on future agency reports to identify
opportunities for action, and there are no milestones set up for
long-term progress evaluation. [[An assessment by the [Brookings
Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/02/12/assessing-trumps-artificial-intelligence-executive-order/)
worries that without dedicated funding a]{.mark}nd concrete mechanisms
for implementation or inter-agency coordination[, the initiative will
fail]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On the other hand, the day after Trump's executive order was issued,
[[the D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense rel[eased its
[Artificial Intelligence
Strategy](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Feb/12/2002088963/-1/-1/1/SUMMARY-OF-DOD-AI-STRATEGY.PDF)]{.mark},
establishing its own objectives and strategies regarding
AI]{.underline}. Additionally, the executive order references a
yet-unreleased National Security Presidential Memorandum, "[Protecting
the United States Advantage in Artificial Intelligence and Related
Technologies," which will guide the development of the action plan to
protect American AI technology.]{.underline}

Last week, experts in advanced materials testified before a House

possible applications. But, warning that [they [face fierce

#### Space solves US leadership

**[Morin 18]{.underline}** (Jamie Morin is vice president and executive
director of the [Center for Space Policy and

https://www.forbes.com/sites/thelabbench/2018/09/21/sustaining-american-space-leadership-in-an-age-of-disruption/#55dd08716e64)

Since the dawn of the Space Age -- and even earlier -- visionaries have
dreamed of routine spaceflight for science, exploration, and commerce.
Achieving their dream would be a major milestone in culmination of
humankind's long history of gazing at the stars and contemplating the
unknown. Today, we are in a [period of transition: the dream of a
vibrant space economy is on its way to becoming reality]{.underline}.
The United States government and private industry both played a key role
in making it happen, and [[the U.S. has the opportunity to **continue**
its **leadership**]{.mark} [during a]{.mark}n ongoing [period of
disruption]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The first source of disruption is the [increasing democratization of
space. New players are becoming active in space, and some may
intentionally or unintentionally cause difficulties. Many countries now
have access to technologies in which the U.S. formerly had a comfortable
lead]{.underline}. Launch is a key example. Thanks to development of new
indigenous launch systems and contracts with international public and
private launch providers, where space once was the purview of
government-funded space agencies, [today elementary school students can
build satellites and find a ride into
orbit](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cubesat-satellite-nasa-arlington-virginia-school-students-to-be-launched-space/).
Where [once only the superpowers and close allies could afford launch,
now diverse countries have ambitious space programs; for example, [India
has sent a science probe to orbit
Mars](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29341850), [Sri Lanka
is preparing to launch its second
satellite](http://www.supremesat.com/satellites/supremesat-ii/), and the
United Arab Emirates is recruiting astronauts.]{.underline}

A second source of disruption is the sheer scale of [emerging space
activity]{.underline}, yielding an increasingly crowded environment.
Around the world, government and industry researchers are pursuing
capabilities to support [space-enabled businesses and national security.
Increasingly, such capabilities are achieved with large numbers of
small, short-lived satellites rather than small numbers of large,
long-lived satellites]{.underline}. The downside is the [need to address
growing space
traffic](https://aerospace.org/paper/space-traffic-management-age-new-space)
that includes thousands of active satellites and an even greater number
of debris objects -- many of them the legacy of past space projects that
were conceived before protecting the orbital environment was a priority,
and others the product of rising powers destructively [demonstrating
their space warfighting
capability](https://www.space.com/3415-china-anti-satellite-test-worrisome-debris-cloud-circles-earth.html).
Efforts to address this challenge require international cooperation, and
[[**leadership** from the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will be
**essential** in framing what a global space traffic management regime
should look like]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Space weapons]{.underline} tests underscore the third disruptive trend,
in which space is becoming a militarily contested domain after being
viewed as a "sanctuary" since the end of the Cold War. That is,
space-based military capabilities will be threatened (and maybe civilian
satellites as well), making the space environment riskier for all
operators. [The precise directions of this trend depend on future
choices, but increasing commercial activity in space depends on a safe
operating environment, just as the global flow of trade could be greatly
disrupted by a great power conflict at sea.]{.underline}

Some fear this disrupted future. But [[the opportunity for]{.mark}
American [leadership is enormous]{.mark}, and should be cause for
excitement, not fear. The fact that others are catching up to the United
States was inevitable as observers around the world saw the advantages
of space applications and began pursuing them in an age of rapid
technology democratization. [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[is]{.mark} still dominant overall, and [in an excellent position to
shape the future of space]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Neither commercial nor government efforts alone will be sufficient.
Space remains an area where government and private interests are
intertwined. In the United States, private industry has long been
involved in space through government contracts, and as in other areas,
has applied this experience to the development of products and services
for commercial customers. Satellite communications was the first
example, followed by launch services and the sale of Earth imagery from
orbit. As a result, the global commercial space economy is [now
estimated to exceed](https://www.thespacereport.org/) a quarter-trillion
dollars annually, most of it attributable to communications sector
activities like satellite television subscriptions.

The United States now has multiple private companies that can launch
payloads into space, and more domestic launch providers are on the
horizon. [[The U.S. is the first country to be in this enviable
position, and it is the only country that is transferring
responsibilities for [launching human crews to the private
sector](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html)]{.mark}.
With more ways to get to space, launching satellites will become more
affordable, creating a ripple effect of declining costs and increasing
participation in space operations.]{.underline}

But this has been merely the opening act. While growth in the space
launch and satellite business has been significant, it is dwarfed by the
rise of space applications like communications, navigation, and remote
sensing. With the rise of the data economy, the growing investment in
space from so many players is no surprise. Looking into the future, we
are in the early stages of a transition that will vastly expand our
concept of a space economy. Emerging areas include on-orbit servicing,
microgravity research and manufacturing, exploitation of
extraterrestrial resources, and even space tourism.

Human and financial resources are both essential for success in space.
The United States has long been a magnet for people with dreams of
exploring and developing space. For example, a young man named Elon Musk
came from South Africa to study, made his fortune, developed a new
rocket, became a formidable player in the global launch market, and
launched his sports car into space as a demonstration of his ambition to
go to Mars. The space economy will be built by such people and today
many countries are competing for this talent.

[The United States achieved space leadership through decades of
investment in civil and national security programs. [The commercial
sector is now investing significantly]{.mark} on space projects that
used to be government responsibilities, [but that does not mean U.S.
government investment should slacken. To remain a dominant actor]{.mark}
in space[, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must be the pace-setter
for]{.mark} a global assortment of collaborators and competitors across
government, industry, and academia.]{.underline}

#### US leadership is falling in industries like agriculture

Was this enough to stem the inexorable surge of population and poverty?
A world population that had increased by 5 billion since the founding of
the U.N. and the Bretton Woods institutions was beginning to overwhelm
the international system. [[It would take]{.mark} additional resources
and [new innovations to stabilize this new]{.mark} and increasingly
volatile [situation]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the most part, [[western
democracies were not uniformly generous in
responding]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, the immigration flows
encouraged by conflict, criminal gangs, and poverty sparked a nativist,
and at times populist, response.

It may be too early to tell whether the "America First" policies of the
Trump administration will stymy efforts to fully implement a 3D national
security strategy. [The new administration's recommended 30 percent cut
in diplomacy and development foreign affairs accounts was rejected by
Congress]{.underline}. Momentum for more effective development
assistance---built over two administrations through initiatives such as
the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the President's Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), legislation to make food aid more efficient,
reforms to AID Forward, the Development Innovation Laboratory---continue
to garner strong bipartisan congressional support, including through the
Trump administration's USAID transformation program.

[[External support for U.S. aid is strong.]{.mark} Non-governmental
policy and advocacy organizations like the Brookings Institution, the
Modernization of Foreign Assistance Network (MFAN), the U.S. Global
Leadership Coalition (USGLC), the Center for Global Development (CDG),
and the Blum Center for Developing Economies at the University of
California, Berkeley, have contributed creative ideas for invigorating
U.S. development.]{.underline}

Efforts at reinvigorating U.S. architecture include: [[A proposal to
merge and strengthen development finance programs under a new
International Development Finance Corporation]{.mark} (see paper for
Session III); the Aid Accountability and Transparency Act requiring
public disclosure of official development assistance (ODA) in real time;
Support for USAID Administrator Mark Green's plan to merge the Office of
U.S. Disaster Assistance and Office of Food for Peace; Creating a new
Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation, and combining (once
again) USAID's policy and budget functions; Promoting technology
innovations, and; Introducing legislation to reform food
aid.]{.underline}

The [[community of nations is under threat as populist political leaders
challenge the international system]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is difficult
to be optimistic, but [[so long as there is a vibrant development
community seeking solutions, hope endures that logic will prevail.

#### Solves for econ pressures, US leadership and influence, and taking responsibilities

**[Chiang 15]{.underline}** (Min-Hua Chiang is research fellow at
the East Asian Institute. Bandung: Journal of the Global South (2015) 2:
9. https://doi.org/10.1186/s40728-015-0023-9)

In parallel to Perroux's thought about global economic instability
brought by IDE, Reich and Lebow specified that American effort to
maintain order were a primary source of disorder in the international
system. However, different from Perroux, Reich and Lebow reject
conventional view that emphasizes America's structural position in the
global economy or its capacity to leverage its market access by using
crude instruments of power.

Reich and Lebow's main points of view regarding the US hegemonic role
are listed below:

1\.

[[Deterioration of the US power]{.mark}]{.underline} since the post-war
period: Different from conventional belief that the US hegemony has
continuously existed since the end of WWII, Reich and Lebow considered
[the American hegemony has quickly [eroded]{.mark}]{.underline} during
the post-war period [[following other countries' growing economic
strength and political stability.]{.underline}]{.mark}

2\.

[[Focus on the US "influence]{.mark}" rather than "power": Reich and
Lebow argued that "[America is unequivocally powerful but only
occasionally influential]{.mark}".]{.underline} Over the past decades,
the US translation of its power into influence has proved a failure as
shown in the ineffective results of US aid to Egypt and Israel as well
as in the case of military invasion in Iraq. [The ineffectiveness of US
intervention in other countries' affairs showed that a hegemon did not
always contribute to international stability.]{.mark}

3\.

Rejection of hegemon's multi-functional capacity: Reich and Lebow
[disagreed with the typical realists and liberals' description about
hegemon's multiple functions in providing leadership, economic
management and security goods. Instead, [they believe that the world is
shifting towards a division of functions. Other actors will emerge in
taking more responsibilities and exert more influence. New transnational
forces, coupled with US loss of legitimacy and abandonment of
its]{.mark} traditional [economic management responsibilities]{.mark}
have accelerated the [fragmentation]{.mark} of those functions that
usually associated with [hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline}

However, the above statements are arguable. First, other countries'
development of economic strength during the post war decade, especially
Asian countries, has been based on the US market opening up. Although
the US progressively ceased the financial aid to these capitalist
countries during the cold war era, the aid actually continued but was
transformed into another form. That means the US investment in
developing countries as well as consumption of goods from these
countries. The so-called state-led economic development in Asia would
not have a success if there was no US tolerance of huge imports from
these developing countries. In term of political stability in certain
countries, it has been based on the military alliance or defense treaty
between the US and individual countries to deter potential aggression
from another country. For example, the US supplied Taiwan military
equipment to prevent from China's invasion. The US aided South Korea in
defense the country from being attacked by the North.

SINGAPORE -- A decade of often bruising negotiations has led to a new
agreement for cooperation, as [[China and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([[ASEAN]{.mark})
regional bloc issued a draft document committing to [working together,
conduct that will govern future talks over the S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea.]{.underline}

A 26-page [joint
communiqué](http://asean.org/joint-communique-51st-asean-foreign-ministers-meeting/)
followed a series of meetings in Singapore involving the ASEAN member
states plus China and Japan, where the goal of regional economic
integration was laid out along with the need for cooperation to weather
the potential disruptions posed by high technology.

"[We reiterated the priority placed by ASEAN on the RCEP]{.underline}
\[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership\] [as a centerpiece of its
external economic relations, particularly at a time of growing
uncertainty in global trade,]{.underline}" the joint statement read. The
RCEP is a proposed [[free-trade agreement between ASEAN and]{.mark}
Australia[, China]{.mark}, India, Japan, South Korea and New
Zealand]{.underline}.

The statement also [conveyed the 11 nations' firm resolve to "fully tap
the opportunities afforded by new technologies and innovation arising
from the digital revolution]{.underline}", as well as to remain
observant and responsive to emerging threats like ecological
degradation, and unconventional security issues such as radicalization,
violent extremism, illicit drugs, transnational crime and cybersecurity
threats.

[[Beijing stresses harmful role of "external
disturbances"]{.underline}]{.mark}

China and ASEAN will also hold joint military exercises in October as a
means to build mutual trust among the states and enhance the cooperation
of navies, according to the statement.

In a draft text, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi noted China's desire
that the ASEAN-China Maritime Exercise become a regularly-held event,
but that the war games should not involve extra-regional countries
"unless the parties concerned are notified beforehand and express no
objection."

[[The top diplomat for the East Asian powerhouse hailed the agreement as
a breakthrough while warning of the danger posed by outside
meddlers]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Ruling out external disturbances, the
deliberation of the code of conduct will speed up and move forward,"
Wang noted.

The foreign minister added that the regional bloc and China have proven
their ability to maintain regional stability and peace in the South
China Sea while forging an ultimate framework of rules that all
countries would observe. Wang said:

It is like China and ASEAN countries building a house together. In the
past, there were 11 designs from the 11 countries on what this house
would look like. Now we have laid good groundwork for a single design of
this house."

China and the Southeast Asian bloc could also collaborate in joint oil
and gas exploration in the waters but foreign firms would be excluded in
this respect as well, Beijing suggested in the text.

While China's allies in ASEAN like Cambodia and Laos have sided with
Beijing over the territorial disputes, the Philippines and especially
Vietnam have lodged protests against China's moves to change the reality
on the ground.

Hanoi was infuriated by Beijing's moves to place an oil rig in waters it
claimed in 2014, as well as its recent transformation of disputed reefs
into fortified man-made islands complete with runways, tunnels, advanced
weapons systems and other high-tech infrastructure. The draft document
contained Vietnam's criticisms of China's construction of artificial
islands.

Such differences are unlikely to be resolved overnight, regardless of
China's expressed optimism.

China comes into its own as U.S. goes on the attack

Beijing's approach appears committed to eroding the regional dominance
of the United States. Since the end of the Second World War, the U.S.
has been the foremost military power in the Asia-Pacific region.
Washington has frequently weighed in against China amid the contention
surrounding the South China Sea.

[[China has]{.mark} long [pointed to the U.S. as the main source of
regional tensions,]{.mark} accusing the U.S. of meddling in Asian
matters through its repeated deployments of warships and jets in the
regional waters while attempting to consolidate a new "Indo-Pacific"
alliance meant to contain a rising China.]{.underline}

The two are embroiled in a heated trade dispute amid mutual accusations
of protectionism and the imposition of tariffs. On Thursday, the U.S.
placed new restrictions on 44 Chinese companies it sees as posing a
"significant risk" to its national security and foreign policy
interests.

In an [editorial](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1113616.shtml)
published Thursday evening in the English-language edition of Global
Times, an outlet closely affiliated with the ruling Communist Party of
China, the paper urged the Chinese people to maintain a realistic view
of the country's "ability to withstand a comprehensive U.S. trade war."

Warning against both overconfidence and excessive doubt by public
intellectuals, the paper noted:

Under the current circumstances, Beijing has no will to initiate a trade
war with Washington, but is forced to fight back strategically. Chinese
society has various opinions on the reason why the trade war started,
and all these opinions are worth summarizing. However, it needs the
solidarity and confidence of all of society to confront U.S. pressure,
and fear of the U.S. won't help.

... [[Opening up is a must for China, and the struggle against U.S.
heg]{.mark}emony during the process [is]{.mark} also
[unavoidable]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[[Regional odds increasingly favor Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Southeast Asian elites have expressed doubts over the United States'
ability to retain its regional dominance, especially given the erratic
leadership of President Donald Trump and his administration's stubborn
"America First" agenda of reducing trade deficits with other countries
by demanding they drop their protectionism. Traditional allies like
Indonesia and Japan have balked at the White House's domineering
approach to these talks.]{.underline}

On the other hand, [[China's strength is increasingly seen as a new
reality]{.mark} that's here to stay]{.underline}. Businesses across the
region have hoped to attract Chinese investments, tempering their unease
and opposition to Beijing's policies.

Earlier this week, U[.[S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a
\$113 million infrastructure fund for Asia-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}
[development as a part of Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy [to counter
what it sees as an emerging Chinese leadership role or "dominance" over
the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pompeo is currently on a tour of
Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia where he is expected to lay out the
White House's Southeast Asian regional policy.

Given the apparent consensus on the need for regional differences to
remain a regional affair that should be sorted out by locals, [Pompeo
may not receive the acquiescence to U.S. demands or commitment to its
flagging hegemony for which he seems to be hoping.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Undo Trump CP

#### Plan: The United States federal government should:

- Reverse all Trump executive actions

- Develop a sanctions doctrine

- Create a White House Council of Foreign Affairs Advisors

- Create a bipartisan National Commission on Reforming America's Foreign
  Policy Architecture

- Substantially increase defense spending, including promoting naval
  deployment, deterrence posture, and new military technology.

#### That solves US leadership and overwhelms the alt causes

Late last week Heather Hurlburt did a mitzvah and wrote an excellent
Lawfare review essay on the current state of debate over U.S. grand
strategy. She noted, \"though the authors include Republicans, Democrats
and people unaffiliated with either party, all share an eagerness for a
day when Donald Trump and his acolytes are not running U.S. foreign
policy, and each seeks to push forward the national security
community\'s preparations for that day.\"

Hurlburt was kind enough to include my recent Foreign Affairs essay in
her discussion. While she suggested that I was part of the camp
\"insisting that [[the U.S. leadership role can be recouped, and]{.mark}
that the investment needed to do so would be worthwhile]{.underline},\"
I fear she might have overestimated the optimism contained in that
essay. I literally wrote, \"In most Foreign Affairs articles, this is
the moment when the writer calls for a leader to exercise the necessary
political will to do the right thing. That exhortation always sounded
implausible, but now it sounds laughable.\"

Still, nihilism is not my natural métier. After that essay\'s
publication, I\'ve received queries from surprising places that (a)
agree with my diagnosis of the problem but (b) want to know if there\'s
a remedy. If one believes that [it is in the U.S. national interest to
continue to exercise leadership, how can [that leadership be
sustained]{.mark}]{.underline}? To put it more plainly: can I prove my
nihilist sentiments wrong?

That is exactly the kind of challenge any self-respecting academic would
accept. Recall my primary concern in that essay: a [[combination of
Ideas Industry effects]{.mark}, political polarization, [and the erosion
of checks]{.mark} and balances [on the presidency]{.mark} have [created
a system where presidents had amassed]{.mark} unfettered [foreign policy
authorities but]{.mark} may [also find]{.mark} all [their actions
reversed by their successor from the opposing party]{.mark}: \"The
question is not what U.S. foreign policy can do after Trump. The
question is whether there is any viable grand strategy that can endure
past an election cycle.\"]{.underline}

So, can this be fixed? Maybe. If I were advising an incoming
administration on what to do to preserve and restore U.S. leadership in
the world, here\'s my proposed set of policies, in sequence:

1\. [[Reverse all Trump executive actions as soon as possible]{.mark}.
As previously noted, [an awful lot of Trump\'s foreign policy legacy
consists solely of executive actions; most of the controversial bits can
be reversed]{.mark} as [quickly]{.mark} as possible. And I mean
everything: [lift the tariffs on steel and aluminum, lift the tariffs on
China, rejoin JCPOA]{.mark} (or, if that is not possible, restart
nuclear negotiations with Iran), [the Paris climate accords and the U.N.
H]{.mark}uman [R]{.mark}ights [C]{.mark}ouncil, [end the declared state
of emergency on the Southern border, the whole
smash.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The idea here would be to [[signal to the rest of the world that the Age
of Trump was a blip and not a trend]{.underline}]{.mark}. Obviously this
would not extend to anything ratified by Congress, such as USMCA (if
that happens). However, in many ways [these very revocations would
further confirm my claim that foreign policy is now being conducted by
presidential whim. So this would be a weak signal, but still an initial
gesture of good faith]{.underline}. Then \...

2\. [[Develop a sanctions doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark}. One area where
the United States continues to exercise unparalleled power is in the
financial realm. [[The]{.mark} Trump administration\'s [sanctions
addiction]{.mark}, however, [has gotten so bad that it is roiling allies
and rivals alike into finding ways to route around the
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Jack Lew and Richard Nephew have warned,
[[this]{.mark} is a brilliant way to [erode U.S. structural
power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

One [[way to forestall this decline is to articulate a set of principles
under which the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would choose to resort
to financial statecraft]{.mark}.]{.underline} What are the conditions
under which the United States would act unilaterally? When would
secondary sanctions be considered? This should come in the form of a
presidential speech at the Treasury Department. And these criteria
better be pretty damn stringent; otherwise this will not reassure
anyone.

[A key part of this would be a willingness to work with Congress to
reform the tools the Trump administration has abused, including Section
232 of the 1962 Trade Act and the International Emergency Economic
Powers Act. The goal would be to forestall more concerted action by U.S.
allies to widen the workarounds for U.S. financial
sanctions.]{.underline}

3\. [[Create a White House Council of Foreign Affairs
Advisers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Foreign policy is just as important to
the White House as economic policy, so I see no reason why [[political
scientists should]{.mark}]{.underline} not [[get their own
council]{.underline}]{.mark}. This would have the added benefit of
[[bolstering presidential reliance on expertise, which]{.mark} I hear
[has been a problem as of late]{.mark}]{.underline}. This council would
differ from the National Security Council in providing a bigger picture
on how U.S. foreign policy connects to U.S. national interests. It could
also take over the lead on drafting the U.S. National Security Strategy.

Is empowering international relations academics self-serving? You
betcha! It would nonetheless be another way to bridge the gap between
policymakers and scholars.

4\. [[Create a bipartisan National Commission on Reforming America\'s
Foreign Policy Architecture]{.underline}]{.mark}. National commissions
are often ways to turf out problems that cannot be immediately resolved.
Still, they can matter on occasion, and this might be one of those
times. In her essay, Hurlburt wrote, [\"writers from hard-bitten
realists to antiwar liberals to internationalist conservatives nearly
all see a continuing role for at least some parts of the alliances and
multilateral organizations against which Trump and his enablers have
successfully rallied their supporters]{.underline}.\" This suggests that
it might be possible to [[assemble a group]{.mark} of progressives,
liberal internationalists, conservatives and even populists to [discuss
whether there are common foundations for how to make the foreign policy
machinery run better, the proper allocation of resources, how to get
Congress more involved and how to ensure that commitments last beyond a
presidential terms]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Finally \....

5\. Educate the public. None of this will work unless there is some
buy-in from the American people. This requires a president willing to
forego Executive Time to actually connect the vagaries of foreign policy
to bread-and-butter issues for U.S. citizens. Ironically enough, this
might be Trump\'s greatest long-term service to U.S. foreign policy. By
constantly disrupting the machine, he has highlighted the costs of those
disruptions. The polling data suggest that a message of the importance
of credible commitments would register with the American people. The
next president has to sell it, however.

Will any of this work? I don\'t know. But that\'s what I have. I think
[[it would be worth trying]{.mark}.]{.underline}

President Donald [[Trump's]{.mark} stunning [words]{.mark} and actions
to our European allies this week]{.underline} --- culminating in
[reports](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-withdraws-from-paris-climate-agreement-dad94f51071d)
that he will exit the historic Paris climate agreement --- [[signal the
end of the American Century]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Rather than strive to maintain the]{.mark} United States' [position as
the leader of the free world]{.mark}, a role we have assigned to
ourselves for decades, [Trump is content with America the
villain]{.mark} --- the greedy and myopic country [that killed
humanity's]{.mark} [last, best
[hope]{.mark}](https://thinkprogress.org/in-historic-paris-climate-deal-world-unanimously-agrees-to-not-burn-most-fossil-fuels-8bf8cb3a9d64#.y24me6frw)
[of avoiding]{.mark} catastrophic [climate change]{.mark}. Also, by
abandoning clean energy, which is the one new sector capable of actually
creating millions of high wage American jobs, [Trump is officially
handing the economic reins over to]{.mark} Europe and
[China]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Samantha Power, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in the
Obama administration, [echoed that
sentiment](https://twitter.com/SamanthaJPower/status/869880545559367681)
on Twitter Wednesday morning.

"America is responsible, to herself as well as to history, for the world
environment in which she lives," wrote publisher Henry Luce in a famous
February 17, 1941 Life magazine editorial, "[The American
Century](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6139.htm)."

Luce was writing about [America's obligation to end its
isolationism]{.underline} and enter World War II. But he had a broader
purpose, to discuss a "fundamental issue which faces America as it faces
no other nation," an issue "deeper even than the immediate issue of
war."

That issue was whether [America would assume the mantle of global
leader]{.underline}. Luce explained that throughout our history, "[this
continent teemed with manifold projects and magnificent purposes. Above
them all... was the triumphal purpose of freedom. It is in this spirit
that all of us are called, each to his own measure of capacity, and each
in the widest horizon of his vision, to create the first great American
Century."]{.underline}

In words that still ring true today, Luce described what would happen if
America met the challenge and took a global leadership role --- and what
would happen if we retreated into isolationism:

If America meets it correctly, then, despite hosts of dangers and
difficulties, we can look forward and move forward to a future worthy of
men, with peace in our hearts. If we dodge the issue, we shall flounder
for ten or 20 or 30 bitter years in a chartless and meaningless series
of disasters.

And so [the U.S. finds itself at the same crossroads today]{.underline}.
After a disastrous European trip in which [[Trump offended many world
leaders, refused to endorse our commitment to defend our NATO allies,
and persuaded Germany that we aren't a reliable partner, a decision to
exit the Paris climate deal would be]{.mark} the last straw, [a blunder
of historical import]{.mark}.]{.underline}

By torpedoing the unanimous agreement among more than 190 nations aimed
at sparing humanity decades, if not centuries, of misery, [[Trump will
destroy America's "soft power," our ability to achieve outcomes we
desire in other global negotiations.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Trump will be destroying the global influence that was at the core
of]{.mark} Luce's definition of [the American
Century]{.mark}]{.underline}: "to accept wholeheartedly our duty and our
opportunity as the most powerful and vital nation in the world and in
consequence to exert upon the world the full impact of our influence,
for such purposes as we see fit and by such means as we see fit."

Ironically, [[by gutting domestic climate action and clean energy
investment, Trump will]{.mark} also [weaken the U.S.
economically]{.mark}; other countries, particularly China, have
indicated they intend to seize on the vast wealth and high paying jobs
that come with leadership in clean energy and climate solutions, which
will be a]{.underline} [[\$50 trillion-plus
market]{.underline}](https://thinkprogress.org/clean-energy-charts-of-the-year-2016-93d781b55adb)
[in the coming decades.]{.underline}

China [has already announced its
intention](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/business/dealbook/world-economic-forum-davos-climate-energy.html)
to be the economic leader and global hero on climate change. Indeed, one
leading Australian financial columnist
[called](http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/donald-trump-in-the-white-house-is-the-end-of-the-american-century-20170119-gtv1ae.html)
Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at the World Economic Forum in
Davos in January "the moment China's president claimed global leadership
on trade and climate in the vacuum of America's advertised withdrawal."

The official China Daily wrote [in a
commentary](http://www.smh.com.au/world/chinas-xi-jinping-warns-against-trade-war-in-defence-of-globalisation-20170117-gtte45.html)
at the time, "ready or not, China has become the de facto world leader
seeking to maintain an open global economy and battle climate change."
It called China "the one major power with a global outlook."

Unless Trump is replaced in 2020 by a president committed to domestic
and global climate action, he will have free reign to fully thwart the
world's last plausible realistic chance to avoid disaster. America, the
richest country and biggest cumulative carbon polluter, will inevitably
be blamed for the ever worsening weather extremes, sea level rise, ocean
acidification, and climate conflicts here and abroad.

Luce truly described the future Trump is creating for us with remarkable
prescience: "We shall flounder for 10 or 20 or 30 bitter years in a
chartless and meaningless series of disasters."

#### US Climate Leadership is key -- solves global cooperation and ensure allied strength

**[Zhu and Ye 16]{.underline}** (Mengye Zhu is a Doctoral Candidate at
Tsingua University. Qi Ye is a Director at The Climate Policy
Initiative. 12-9-2016, \"A shift toward climate leadership,\" Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/12/13/a-shift-toward-climate-leadership/)

Implementation was the keyword for the 22nd Conference of Parties
meeting (COP22), recently held in Marrakech, Morocco. In October, 113
out of 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change ratified the Paris Agreement, representing 80 percent of global
CO2 emissions.

Following this achievement, two urgent matters lie ahead: the
development of elaborate and concrete road maps to achieve the goals set
in the agreement and fulfilling what is left in the Kyoto Protocol.
Marrakech was, without doubt, the beginning of the post-Paris era.

[Climate finance was under the spotlight during the conference,
discussed widely across national pavilions and at side events. Deep
concerns were shared by developing countries, especially the least
developed and most vulnerable. Although developed countries promised at
Copenhagen in 2009 to give annual aid of \$100 billion (94 billion
euros; 79 billion) from 2010 to 2020 to help developing countries cope
with climate change, so far there is still an annual \$40 to \$70
billion gap to fill.]{.underline} Additionally, this is only the
financing shortage within the Kyoto time frame. The world is facing an
even bigger challenge when it comes to the Paris Agreement.

Last year, before the Paris Conference, developed countries, led by the
European Union and the United States, secretly formed a "high ambition
coalition" with 79 African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries, but
excluding China and India. The group emerged at the end of the
conference to push for a legally binding plan to hold the global
temperature increase to within 1.5 C by 2100, instead of the former
agreed target of 2 C. The final version of the Paris Agreement,
therefore, states "pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to
1.5 C above pre-industrial levels". [This plan serves the best interests
of vulnerable countries. But [the climate finance conundrum dragged the
ambition down to earth at COP22, with]{.mark} the name "Donald [Trump"
contributing to the process.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Noticeably, the landscape of climate leadership is shifting toward the
east. China was widely expected to play a leading role at COP22, an
expectation reinforced by the pessimistic atmosphere created by Trump's
election.

[Noticeably, the [landscape of climate leadership is shifting toward the
east]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark} wa[s widely expected to play
a leading role]{.mark} at COP22, [an expectation reinforced by the
pessimistic atmosphere created by Trump's election]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Over the years, [China has indeed proactively helped other developing
countries on climate change]{.underline}. From 2011, China has invested
more than \$1 billion to help African and vulnerable countries. [In last
year's US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change, [China
committed to establishing the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change
Fund and to provide \$3.1 billion in three years]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This will [finance programs including infrastructure construction,
personnel training and capacity building in developing
countries]{.underline}. At COP22, this commitment was strengthened again
by Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change
affairs, during the High-Level Forum on South-South Cooperation on
Climate Change, which was the most important event in the China
pavilion. During the forum, the COP22 president, UN officials and dozens
of ministers from developing countries shared their views and visions on
south-south cooperation and China's positive role in it.

[[By incorporating climate change in]{.mark} south-south [cooperation,
China expanded the scope for foreign aid, which is]{.mark} widely
recognized as [an important strategy in every country's foreign policy
portfolio]{.mark}.]{.underline} The poor and vulnerable countries cry
for money, technology and expertise to adapt to climate change and
develop a green economy. In this sense, conventional foreign aid targets
such as poverty, health and education can be considered more broadly as
climate change issues.

Geopolitically, large powers compete for greater influence in global
governance through foreign aid programs. [The gap in climate financing
therefore offers considerable opportunities for competitive donors to
influence the climate agenda and international affairs more generally.
In this potential competition, [China has many advantages, including
empathy for the need for economic development and the necessity of
cooperation. This has resulted in China's "assistance-plus investment"
foreign aid model]{.mark}.]{.underline}

International opinion on China's foreign aid, however, is extremely
polarized. Some argue that China's no "strings attached" approach is
efficient and generates win-win outcomes. Others criticize this direct,
economically-driven assistance as a form of neocolonialism.

[Unarguably, [China's influence on less-developed countries has been
growing rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with growing concern from
the West. [The reasons behind this come not only from concerns that
China may undermine the democratic process of these countries but also,
and more important, from the fear of losing advantages they earn from
their own foreign aid programs.]{.underline}

The elephant in the room at COP22 was the question, [Does Trump fear
losing these advantages? He claimed on the campaign trail that he would
halt US funding for UN climate change programs, seemingly undermining US
President Barack Obama's original commitment of \$3 billion. What he
will actually do once in office remains to be seen.]{.underline}

Regardless, [[China is taking on a growing leadership role in global
climate governance]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is inevitable that the
shifting landscape toward China's leadership will put pressure on the US
in terms of its global image and influence. The world can only hope
that, as a self-proclaimed successful investor, Trump will come to agree
with Obama that climate finance is "a smart investment for us to make".

### 2NC -- Undo Trump -- Solvency

#### It solves and avoids the net benefit

Iran Nuclear Agreement,\" NIAC,
https://www.niacouncil.org/jcpoa-report/)

Lawrence Wilkerson, Col, USA (Ret), former chief of staff to secretary
of state Colin Powell: "NIAC's report, "[Restoring U.S. Credibility --
Returning to the Iran Nuclear Agreement", is not only a powerful
indictment of the Trump Administration's security policy, it is a clear
and clarion call for redress]{.underline}. The report makes quite clear
that [[without a resumption of our agreed responsibilities under the
JCPOA, alliances will fracture, de-dollarization movements will proceed
apace, enemies will gain ground, and Iran will]{.mark} not be
substantially prevented from [acquir]{.mark}ing [a nuclear
weapon]{.mark}.]{.underline} War could even result. [The wonder is that
the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in the first place; even more of a
marvel--but entirely wise and proper--would be a successful
return.]{.underline} Every concerned party should be working toward that
end."

Hooman Majd, Iranian-American writer: "I[t almost goes without saying
that [the best option for de-escalating tensions in the Mid]{.mark}dle
[East, and preventing nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration, [is for the U.S. to
return to the JCPOA]{.mark} nuclear accord. It is unimaginable that Iran
would agree to a new deal---or indeed any other deal on other issues of
contention---without the U.S. first abiding by the commitments that it
made when it signed on, along with five other powers, to the nuclear
deal with Iran]{.underline}."

Ned Price, Director of Policy and Communication at National Security
Action: "There is much that we still don't know about the Trump
administration's plans and intentions regarding Iran, but here's what we
do know: the withdrawal from the Iran deal was a political maneuver
designed solely to satisfy the President's base. It was manifestly not
in our national security interest, as it has the potential to free Iran
from the most stringent verification and monitoring regime ever
negotiated, while also simultaneously setting us on a possible path
toward another disastrous Middle Eastern conflict. What we also know,
however, is that the new Democratic House now has the oversight tools to
spotlight and constrain the administration's recklessness, just as we
begin to clear the path for the next administration's reentry into the
deal. There may be tactical disagreements regarding how to most
effectively confront Iran's destabilizing regional activities[, but
[there must be a strategic recognition that only the JCPOA provides a
baseline that allows us to achieve our most important objective: a
nuclear weapons-free Iran."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Barbara Slavin, Director of the Future of Iran Initiative at The
Atlantic Council: "I concur that [[the]{.mark} next US [administration
should return to the JCPOA--]{.mark} assuming Iran has remained
compliant --- [and]{.mark} also [lift the travel ban]{.mark}. The US
should also request new talks with Iran both on repairing the damage
from the unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA and on other issues of
mutual concern]{.underline}.

Narges Bajoghli, Assistant Professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies: "[[It is **crucial** for America's **standing**
in the world that we]{.mark} work to [re-enter the JCPOA]{.mark} in the
near future]{.underline}. This report provides concrete steps that
Congress can take now to ensure that we return to the promises we made
to the international community. [Without doing so, America will continue
to act as a force of instability in the Middle East."]{.underline}

Farideh Farhi, Independent Scholar and Affiliate Graduate Faculty at the
University of Hawai'i at Manoa: "The Trump Administration's
ill-conceived rejection of the JCPOA and policy of 'maximum pressure'
can no doubt inflict pain on the Iranian people. [[It can]{.mark} also
court disaster in [risk]{.mark}ing [Iran's resumption of]{.mark} its
[nuclear activities, further destabilization of the Mid]{.mark}dle
[East, and possibly even another costly US war]{.mark} in the region.
Remaining quiet in the face of these predictable harms is not an
option]{.underline}. This report offers timely and reasonable
recommendations for keeping the JCPOA alive as a pathway for the
re-emergence of a saner approach to Iran."

Bijan Khajehpour, economist and a managing partner at Eurasian Nexus
Partners: "[[The US rejoining the JCPOA]{.mark} and helping to sustain a
multilateral agreement [will]{.mark} not only [reduce the likelihood of
an unnecessary nuclear arms race]{.mark} in the Middle East, [but also
prevent a radicalisation of Iranian politics]{.mark}. A moderate Iran is
important for regional stability, the containment of jihadist movements
and the future energy security for US allies globally]{.underline}."

Nicholas Miller, Assistant Professor of Government at Dartmouth College
"The [[JCPOA has successfully curtailed Iran's nuclear program and
remains the surest tool for preventing an Iranian bomb]{.mark}. The new
Congress should do what it can to limit the serious damage done by the
Trump administration's withdrawal from the deal. If the administration's
'maximum pressure' campaign continues to escalate, the odds increase
that Iran will exit the agreement and move closer to a nuclear weapon,
which could in turn spark a costly war]{.underline}."

Paul Pillar, Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Center for Security
Studies at Georgetown University: "Candidates and legislators of all
political persuasions would do well to read and heed this report. The
Trump administration's abandonment of arms control and diplomacy in
favor of conflict and confrontation has brought the United States only
isolation and infamy as well as heightened risk of war. It is [not too
late to return to compliance with the JCPOA and to a course that
demonstrably serves U.S. interests better than the current policy
does."]{.underline}

Ellie Geranmayeh, Deputy Head MENA program at The European Council on
Foreign Relations "President [[Trump's decision to withdraw the
US]{.mark} from the JCPOA]{.underline}, after months of negotiations
with European allies earlier this year on pathways to sustain the
agreement, [[was significantly damaging for transatlantic
ties]{.underline}]{.mark}. This wound has been deepened by the manner in
which the White House has sidelined European security interests and
tried to impede their efforts to preserve the JCPOA, as enshrined by a
UN Security Council. This report [highlights the urgent need for the US
executive and legislative branch to reassure European allies that in
matters of foreign policy, the United States is a credible and
consistent partner.]{.underline} Moreover, the US should reassure
European capitals and companies that US sanctions policy will not seek
to illegitimately target allies in pursuit of a maximalist policy that
is unlikely to trigger fundamental changes in Iranian behaviour."

#### That restores US power projection and deterrence

Strategy. Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2018.

Toward a New Approach to Power Projection As noted above, war-gaming
conducted by RAND and DoD has been evaluating the performance of future
U.S. forces in scenarios involving adversaries with advanced A2/AD
capabilities. Insights derived from those efforts point to [three key
elements of a new approach to projecting power against these most
capable adversaries]{.underline}.19 First, [[forward-based U.S. forces
and infrastructure must be sufficiently robust to withstand initial
attacks]{.mark} by enemy anti-access systems [and provide essential
enabling capabilities for early strike operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In NATO/Europe, this means rebuilding a posture of land and air forces
on the alliance's eastern flank that is capable of confronting a
combined arms Russian invasion. In both Europe and the Western Pacific,
it means [[building]{.mark} a [more-resilient]{.mark} network of
[bases]{.mark} through selective hardening, redundancy and dispersal,
deception measures, and active defenses against cruise missiles;
[enhancing the resiliency of space-based capabilities for
reconnaissance]{.mark}, communications, and positioning, navigation, and
timing; and ensuring that operations can be effectively orchestrated in
wartime even when command and control assets are under intensive
attack]{.underline}. Second, [[U.S. forces must find ways to
detect]{.mark}, identify, track, and engage [and damage key elements of
the enemy's operational center of gravity]{.mark}]{.underline}---its
invading forces---from the outset of hostilities in circumstances in
which the air, sea, land, space, and cyber domains are heavily
contested. Even with improvements to forward posture and capabilities,
U.S. forces likely will not have time to defeat the enemy's principal
threats to their operations in these domains prior to attacking its
invading forces. [Therefore, [U.S. and allied forces must find ways to
"reach into" contested areas of the battlespace in order to
delay]{.mark}, disrupt, [and]{.mark} ultimately [defeat an attacking
force]{.mark}. For this, U.S. forces today have two important trump
cards to play: heavy bombers and undersea platforms]{.underline}. The
U.S. fleet of 96 combat-coded bombers---B-1s, B-2s, and B-52s---
supplemented by aerial refueling aircraft, can operate from bases that
lie beyond the range of Chinese and Russian conventionally armed
ballistic missiles. If equipped with sufficient numbers of capable
standoff weapons, these aircraft can bring sustained, accurate firepower
to bear against naval vessels, C2 nodes, logistics and support
facilities, and mechanized ground forces. [U]{.underline}.S. submarines
can evade detection and launch standoff weapons as well, although their
weapons-carrying capacity is rather limited. Future generations of
large, unmanned underwater vehicles have the potential to expand the
attack capacity of the Navy's submersible fleet.

#### Deterrence solves

https://www.journal-neo.org/2017/10/29/usa-military-force-projection-semper-paratus/)

[[Behind all the bluster is a US military with morale at an all-time
low]{.underline}]{.mark}, with preparedness in many cases abysmally
inadequate, and using technologies that are costly to taxpayers [[and
far behind the state of the art of]{.mark} other potential
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}. All are symptoms of a failing former
sole superpower whose military is being gravely abused and misused, far
from the intent for defense of the nation.

US Navy Collisions

[This August the USS John Sidney McCain, a guided-missile destroyer of
the US Navy's Seventh Fleet collided with an oil tanker off Singapore,
killing ten sailors]{.mark}. Two months earlier the Japan-based USS
Fitzgerald collided with a merchant ship killing seven sailors and
causing an estimated half-a billion dollars in damage. A Naval
intelligence investigation found zero evidence of cyber-attack. For once
Washington did not try to blame Russia or China. The fault lies at home.

[Incredible as it may seem, for the world's largest and most formidable
Navy, [a decision was made]{.mark} during the Bush-Cheney Administration
when Don Rumsfeld was Secretary of Defense [to "save money" by scrapping
the traditional training of Navy officers.]{.mark}]{.underline} As naval
electronics such as advanced radar, sonar, gun, missile, and data
linkage systems became more complex during the 1960s, the Navy created
what was called the Surface Warfare Division Officer School which gave
future officers a rigorous 12-14 months of training before they boarded
their first ship. In 2003, it was shut down "to create efficiencies,"
and replaced by computer-based training (CBT). Instead of attending the
earlier training, new naval officers were given a packet of computer
training discs and the ship commander was told to be responsible for the
competence of officers under their command.

Vice Admiral Timothy LaFleur, the one responsible for the decision,
sharply criticized by many officers, insisted [the [elimination
of]{.mark} serious training [would, "result in higher professional
satisfaction, increase the return on investment during the first
division officer tour, and free up more career time downstream." The
training cuts saved a ludicrous \$15 million a
year]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, over-reliance on "fail-proof"
electronics such as automated radar systems and the automatic
identification system (AIS) led to abandonment of human watch-standers
actually looking out the bridge window of the ship for
[dangers](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017-08/collisions-part-i%E2%80%94what-are-root-causes).
No one was watching on the USS Fitzgerald or the USS McCain.

The commanders of the USS Fitzgerald and the USS McCain were relieved of
their commands, hardly a serious response to the deeper problem. The rot
goes much deeper.

Lower standards

As any honest experienced military veteran of the 1960s Vietnam War can
attest, there is a crucial difference if you come as a foreign soldier
to a land and its people who are fighting for their independence from
foreign military occupation or defending from foreign attack. Ho Chi
Minh, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of
Vietnam, who spent years in the United States and France, led a vastly
under-equipped army of peasants against the best-equipped armed force in
the world and ultimately won.

The fact that the armed forces of the United States, since the end of
the Cold War with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 has not had a
convincing "evil" adversary, has had a huge effect on morale. Going to
Afghanistan in 2001 to destroy Osama bin Laden, then to Iraq to destroy
Saddam Hussein, then to Libya to destroy Muhammar Qaddafi, now to Syria
to destroy Bashar al Assad---none of these "adversaries" are morally
convincing to most Americans.

Not surprisingly, in this context the US Armed Forces are having
difficulty recruiting sufficient qualified, intelligent service
personnel for the wars that Washington and its patrons in Wall Street
seem to want to wage around the world.

This year to meet its quota of new recruits to fill its global missions,
the US Army has had to accept recruits with lower qualifications, to
take recruits who scored in the lower third of the tests, so called
Category Four recruits, including those with records for [drug
use](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/10/army-accepting-more-low-quality-recruits-giving-waivers-marijuana-hit-targets/750844001).

And it is not only the lack of sufficient preparation of its Army
personnel or of its naval officers.

Alarming pilot shortage

On October 23, the US Air Force revealed that it is preparing its fleet
of B-52 nuclear-capable bombers for 24-hour alert status, something not
done since the end of the Cold War, according to Defense One. Airmen at
the Barksdale Air Force base are readying the planes "in case the alert
order is issued." The B-52s would be armed with nuclear bombs available
to take off at a moment's notice something that was discontinued with
the dissolution of the [Soviet Union in
1991](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2017/10/exclusive-us-preparing-put-nuclear-bombers-back-24-hour-alert/141957/).

The mad new plan of Trump's generals however, has an added problem. The
Air Force has a dramatic shortage of qualified pilots.

On October 21, President Trump signed an executive order allowing the
Air Force to call back to service up to 1,000 retired pilots, by
expanding a state of national emergency declared by George W. Bush after
Sept. 11, 2001. The order is part of an attempt "to mitigate the Air
Force's acute shortage of pilots," according to a Pentagon
[spokesman](https://abcnews.go.com/US/air-force-recall-1000-retired-military-pilots-address/story?id=50629597).

For decades the US military--whose annual budget exceeds that of China,
UK, France, Germany, and Russia combined--has waged wars against
military opponents such as Iraq or Afghanistan or Libya where there was
no contest.

This past June the US Army War College issued a study titled, At Our Own
Peril: DoD Risk Assessment in a Post-Primacy World. In the study the
authors conclude that the world order created after World War II,
dominated by the US "is under enormous stress." They add, "The order and
its constituent parts... were transformed to a unipolar system with the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and have by-and-large been dominated by
the United States and its major Western and Asian allies since. Status
quo forces collectively are comfortable with their dominant role in
dictating the terms of international security outcomes and resist the
emergence of rival centers of power and
[authority](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1358)."

The study adds that [[the US "can no longer count on the unassailable
position of dominance]{.mark}, supremacy, or pre-eminence it enjoyed for
the 20-plus years after the fall of the [Soviet
Union](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1358)]{.underline}."

Now, with the emergence of China as a genuine great power, with the
rapid emergence of Russia as a great power in cohesion with China's
vision of an emerging Eurasia, [the [Trump Administration is warring
around with everybody everywhere in what is clearly not either a healthy
conduct of US foreign policy nor a serious manner for a mature nation to
behave.]{.mark}]{.underline} Building up and restoring America's rotting
domestic infrastructure, not building up the US military against
concocted threats or nations who ask the right to own sovereignty,
building the real American economy to rejoin the ranks as a leading
industrial nation makes far more sense in my view.

[says](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48587347). Iran
attacked four tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, the Trump
administration
[says](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2019/06/pompeo-blames-tanker-attacks-iran-offers-no-evidence/157719/?oref=d-topstory).
If all this is true --- Tehran has hinted at the first, though it
strenuously
[denies](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/14/732619332/iran-denies-u-s-claim-that-it-attacked-tankers-in-gulf-of-oman)
the second, and there are doubters [in world
capitals](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-iran-threats.html)
and [at
home](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-blames-iran-tanker-attacks-let-s-be-skeptical-his-ncna1017591)
--- then U.S. policymakers need to conduct an honest assessment of where
and why U.S. policies have failed to deter Iranian actions.

As Washington Post columnist David Ignatius
[summarizes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-the-iran-us-tinderbox-about-to-ignite/2019/06/13/73dcb75e-8e25-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html)
the mounting tensions, "[Trump's maximum pressure campaign has collided
head on with \[Iranian Supreme Leader\] Khamenei's maximum
resistance]{.underline}."

Leaders in Washington and Tehran alike have miscalculated. The Trump
administration applied devastating economic pressure on Iran without
providing leaders in Tehran with a clear roadmap for how to escape
punishment. This put Iran in the penalty box without evident prospect
for rehabilitation. [As Europe, Russia, and China failed to deliver any
meaningful economic relief to Iran, and as [the unilateral U.S.
withdrawal from the]{.mark} Iran nuclear deal, or [JCPOA]{.mark},
[[solidified the position of
hardliners](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/growing-us-pressure-emboldening-iranian-hardliners-53882)
in Tehran]{.mark}, it was virtually inevitable that Iran would strike
back in order to demonstrate its ability to inflict pain on
opponents.]{.underline}

Yet Iranian leaders have badly miscalculated as well, by threatening to
stop complying with at least some provisions of the JCPOA. Inspectors
from the International Atomic Energy Agency have recently
[verified](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/iran-iaea-nuclear-fuel.html)
that Iran is increasing its production of nuclear fuel and Iranian
President Rouhani has pledged that the next step will be to increase the
level of enrichment above allowable levels. These steps are only likely
to increase Iran's diplomatic isolation and will push even reluctant
U.S. allies to back whatever retaliatory action might be taken by the
United States. Meanwhile repeated threats by Iranian leaders to close
the Strait of Hormuz to international traffic only bolster the public
case for Iran's culpability in the recent attacks on tankers.

In the immediate term, the central question that should occupy U.S.
policymakers in Washington is how to restore deterrence in the wake of
these Iranian attacks. As options are considered, U.S. decision-makers
would be well advised to review some of the enduring insights from the
vast academic
[literature](https://www.amazon.com/Arms-Influence-Preface-Afterword-Lectures/dp/0300143370)
on the topic.

At base, [deterrence policy is developed to change the decision-making
calculus of an opponent]{.underline}. As such it is a game of perception
management and clear communication. [[Successful deterrence]{.mark}
requires clear delineation of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. It
[requires that the opponent understand that unacceptable behavior will
be met with a credible punishment]{.mark} whose costs will outweigh any
potential benefit to be gained. Finally, prospects for successful
deterrence are
[improved](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE295.html) when
threats of punishment are combined with positive incentives to alter the
opponent's unacceptable behavior.]{.underline}

Recent events offer clear evidence that U.S. deterrence has failed to
sufficiently alter Tehran's calculus as it weighs its options in
responding to the devastating economic impact of U.S. sanctions.
Restoring deterrence will require changes to U.S. policies.

The first, most obvious, and most emotionally satisfying step will be to
[impose punishment on those responsible for the tanker attacks. U.S.
military spokesmen say a
[video](https://twitter.com/natsecwatson/status/1139349826213228551)
released on Thursday identifies the IRGC as responsible.]{.underline}
President Trump's designation of the IRGC as a terrorist entity in May
provides a ready-made mechanism for imposing additional financial and
economic penalties on this force.

However, Iran's unprovoked attack on international shipping in the
strategically vital Strait of Hormuz will require a more robust response
if deterrence is to be restored. [[An effective response is almost
certain to include U.S. military strikes]{.mark} of one extent or
another]{.underline}. The challenge for U.S. policymakers will be to
design military strikes that are sufficiently strong to deter future
Iranian attacks without provoking escalatory Iranian retaliation that
spins out of control and triggers a broader regional war. Such a
balancing act will require detailed intelligence, precise military
planning, and sophisticated public and private diplomacy.

[U.S. intelligence will need to identify those particular IRGC units,
individuals, and leaders directly responsible for the attacks on the
tankers. U.S. military strikes should explicitly target those facilities
with the aim of both signaling resolve and diminishing the IRGC's
ability to conduct future attacks]{.underline}. U.S. diplomats should
both privately and publicly signal that the U.S. will not tolerate
future actions of this sort. American officials will simultaneously need
to convince leaders in Tehran that the U.S. is not seeking a broader
confrontation with Iran. A forceful, targeted, and proportional
U.S.military response could reassure U.S. regional allies of American
defense commitments while giving leaders in Tehran every incentive to
avoid further escalation.

Quietly through private diplomatic channels such as Swiss
intermediaries, U.S. leaders will also need to provide decision-makers
in Tehran an off-ramp to avoid further escalation and present a concrete
step-by-step plan for getting back to the
[negotiating](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-mike-pompeo.html)
table as President Trump and other senior officials have said is their
ultimate goal.

The [first step]{.mark} in doing so [will be to [clarify U.S. redlines
for objectionable Iranian behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unfortunately,
[[the unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the]{.mark} meticulously
[negotiated and internationally sanctioned JCPOA has primarily served to
muddy the waters around Iranian nuclear enrichment]{.mark}]{.underline}.
U.S. policymakers should clearly explain what specific Iranian actions
could hasten the development of a nuclear weapon and so draw
U.S.military strikes.

The next step should be prioritizing and clarifying the 12 demands that
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo laid on Iran in his May 2018 ["New Iran
Strategy"](https://www.state.gov/after-the-deal-a-new-iran-strategy/)
speech. These demands amount to a requirement that Iran cease enrichment
of uranium, provide anytime-anywhere access to Iranian civilian and
military facilities, halt development of ballistic missiles, end support
to its vast array of Shi'a militia groups deployed in Iraq, Lebanon,
Syria, and Yemen, and stop all further unspecified "threatening
behavior." Such a broad and all-encompassing list of requirements cannot
possibly help leaders in Tehran accurately weigh the costs and benefits
of compliance. In fact, the expansive nature of these demands virtually
guarantees that Iran will remain in violation regardless of any
self-imposed restraints on its behavior short of capitulation. It seems
highly unlikely that Pompeo or his deputies might walk back these
overreaching U.S. demands in public, a private exchange that establishes
clear priorities for changes in Iran's behavior is critical to adjusting
calculations in Tehran.

Finally, U.S. policymakers will have to provide a more concrete roadmap
for getting back to negotiations. President Trump's withdrawal from the
JCPOA despite Iranian compliance has severely damaged the credibility of
any public expressions of a desire for a return to negotiations. In the
immediate wake of Iran's attacks and a likely forthcoming U.S. military
response, the immediate challenge will be to avoid uncontrolled
escalation toward intensified and expanded conflict. However,
identifying small steps that could be taken by Iran that would be
quickly rewarded with a comparably small "reward" by the United States
holds the potential to create positive momentum toward reduced tensions.
If successful, a series of these small confidence-building steps could
provide a sufficient foundation and incentives for both sides to return
to the negotiating table and avoid a broader conflict that both sides
say they want to avoid.

#### The cp solves for deterrence and reasserts American posture

**[Hanson 19]{.underline}** (NRO contributor [VICTOR DAVIS
HANSON](https://www.nationalreview.com/author/victor-davis-hanson/) is a
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author, most recently,
of The Case for Trump. 5-28-2019, \"Trump's High-Wire Act of
Reestablishing Deterrence without War,\" National Review,
https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/trump-foreign-policy-challenge-deterrence-without-war/)

Note that Trump shattered the blue wall in part because of his sober
Jacksonianism: [[restoring U.S.]{.mark} tough [deterrence
without]{.mark} inserting a [large military presence in any]{.mark} of
the [hellholes that U.S. troops have been deployed]{.mark} to
[in]{.mark} the past 50 years, much less falling into a conventional war
that America could win, but only at considerable cost]{.underline}.
Bombing the "sh\*t" out of ISIS was a successful example of a non
non-intervention. Early on, the canny Trump, alone of his Republican
rivals, fathomed that voters neither wanted any more Obama apologetics
nor would put up with another Afghanistan, Libya, or Iraq.

Squaring that circle of toughness without risking a major war is now
Trump's political challenge, given that the shelf life of rhetorical
deterrence is brief.

[The United States cannot abide renegade lunatic regimes with nuclear
missiles aimed at its heartland, or aggressive nuclearized regimes with
which the U.S. had either already fought a major war or narrowly avoided
one. China's destruction of global trading norms only whets China's
appetite to translate its huge profits into military power and
neocolonial adventurism, on the theory that countries that have appeased
its mercantilism will probably do the same in matters of its aggressive
foreign and military policy.]{.underline}

The Palestinians felt that during the Obama years they were insidiously
persuading the United States to ostracize the moderate Arab regimes,
embrace an Iranian foil, and decouple from Israel.

Putin asserted that his weak Russia was a match for a strong U.S.
because he assumed that he was strong and Obama weak --- and therefore
his own godhead could do what his country otherwise could not.

Yet [[Trump]{.mark} all at once [is attempting to straighten out all the
foolishness]{.mark} of the last decade [with China, Iran,]{.mark} North
Korea, Russia, [and the Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark}, and, again, he is
doing so [simultaneously]{.mark}, not sequentially.]{.underline} He
might remember that China is the chief threat, and it has some leverage
with both Iran and North Korea. In other words, [[it would certainly be
in China's interest to see the U.S. in a mess with its surrogates in
Tehran and Pyongyang while America seeks to face down Chinese
mercantilism]{.mark} --- with the Middle East descending into another
hot war.]{.underline}

So, Trump could achieve either high-profile success --- or became mired
in endless engagements and a pre-election, public-relations disaster.

[[Halving]{.mark} the [Chinese trade deficit and forcing]{.mark} it [to
follow global rules would be an astounding achievement. So
would]{.mark}]{.underline} denuclearizing North Korea and [[preventing
Iran from getting the bomb]{.underline}]{.mark}. As would finally
telling the Palestinians to give up terrorism and get on with building a
state, or corralling Putin so that he abandons dreams of a new Soviet
Empire and accepts that Eastern Europe, the Baltic States, and the
breakaway republicans are never going to be Russian again. Prodding a
change in government in Venezuela would create momentum elsewhere in
authoritarian Latin America. Again, to do all that at once, rather than
in sequence, would be singular achievements --- and yet likely
improbable.

George W. Bush tried to address just three existential challenges all at
once following 9/11, and it all but destroyed his presidency. [Bush not
only fashioned a successful multifaceted anti-terrorism strategy that
foiled subsequent attempts to repeat the World Trade Center and Pentagon
bombings, but he took the war to the enemy. Yet soon the U.S. was
fighting wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while trying to stop North
Korea's sudden emergence as a nuclear power, and while battling Iranian
terrorists inside Iraq and Tehran's own nuclear agenda --- as China
stepped up its global profile and began translating its enormous profits
into a growing military, and as OPEC and Middle East suppliers helped
drive up the cost of oil.]{.underline}

What was problematic about Bush's "Axis of Evil" of Iraq, Iran, and
North Korea was not that the term was necessarily inaccurate about the
threats all three posed, or the need to address all of them eventually.
The rub was that a country with a sizable force fighting in Afghanistan
might abruptly find itself fighting three new dirty conflicts all at
once.

In short, [[Trump might learn from the past]{.mark} and avoid what his
opponents hope for --- a series of conflicts dovetailing with the 2020
election, as the financial and psychological strain tax the electorate,
as they did from 2006 to 2008.]{.underline}

Note in this regard how deeply [Trump's opposition is invested in seeing
him fail]{.underline} or, specifically, how private citizen John Kerry,
last spring and summer, and, most recently, Senator Dianne Feinstein
have met with the oleaginous Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif,
ostensibly as "[adults in the room" who agree on waiting Trump out ---
which in fact was the explicit advice recently given to the Chinese by
former State Department official Susan Thornton.]{.underline}

[Trump's "principled realism," "Jacksonianism," or "the Trump doctrine"
ostensibly is tit-for-tat deterrence, not nation-building or optional
interventions]{.underline}. If Iran hits an American ship, the U.S. will
take out a port facility --- but not set foot in Iran. If North Korea
sends more missiles over Japan with Chinese approval, maybe Japan might
have to do the same thing to North Korea with U.S. sanction.

But [Trump also must remember that he ambitiously is trying to solve the
major festering challenges of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline} --- all
at once and right before an election, when his political opposition at
home, most of the European Union, and our enemies would like to see him
fail at last. [So in the next 17 months we should expect all sorts of
provocations from abroad, and so-called Logan Acting at home, to make
Trump stumble and get into a messy intervention before the
election.]{.underline}

He should not take the bait.

#### Deterrence solves for great power war

**[Mueller 18]{.underline}** (Karl P. Mueller is a senior political
scientist at the RAND Corporation and a professor at the Pardee RAND
Graduate School. He specializes in research related to military and
national security strategy, particularly coercion and deterrence.

Distilled to 140 characters, [deterrence is causing someone not to do
something because they expect or fear that they will be worse off if
they do it than if they do not]{.underline}.7 This can be achieved by
[making it appear unlikely that the action will succeed]{.underline}
(deterrence by denial[), by making the expected costs of taking the
action appear prohibitively high (deterrence by
punishment]{.underline}), or by a combination of both.[8 [It is possible
to deter]{.mark}---or to try to deter---all sorts of
[misbehavior]{.mark} (]{.underline}as any police officer, vice
principal, platoon sergeant, or long-suffering parent can attest), but
for the present discussion we will limit our scope to deterring
countries from starting wars or committing other acts of military
aggression.9 Rather than delve at length into deterrence theory, here we
will merely note four key points that will be particularly germane to
the discussion that follows. First, the goal of deterrence is to make
the target choose not to attack even though it has the ability to do so.
[Disarming or destroying the opponent to prevent it from attacking, or
doing something else that physically eliminates the threat, is not
deterrence; instead it is what Thomas Schelling dubbed "pure" or "brute"
force.10 Brute force can be a useful way to solve national security
problems, especially when the enemy is weak, but deterrence is usually
cheaper if it can be achieved]{.underline}. Second, since the target is
choosing between attacking and not attacking, [[deterrence]{.mark} does
not simply depend on making war look bad---it [depends on making war
look worse than the alternative. If the s]{.mark}tatus [quo is
reasonably attractive,]{.mark} as it is for most states most of the
time[, deterrence is]{.mark} likely to be
[easy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} However, a desperate actor may
decide to attack even though it is not optimistic about the likely
results of going to war, if it thinks that not doing so would be
unacceptably costly or dangerous.11 [In other words, the stakes are
critical, as is the baseline against which policy options are being
compared]{.underline}. Moreover, measures that are intended to deter by
posing threats against aggressors can also undermine deterrence by
making their targets feel less secure, reducing the expected value of
not going to war.12 Third, there are many ways to make aggression appear
less attractive than the alternative. [[Threats of
punishment]{.mark}---increasing the expected costs of aggression---[are
the approach most strongly associated with deterrence]{.mark} and can
involve nonmilitary as well as military action]{.underline}. Conversely,
it is possible to [[deter by altering the adversary's expectations about
how likely it will be to win]{.mark} (or achieve other desired
objectives) [if it attacks, usually called "deterrence by
denial]{.mark}"; the line between punishment and denial can be ambiguous
because [taking steps to prevent an enemy from winning]{.mark} almost
always includes imposing costs as well. War can also be made less
attractive by increasing the appeal of not attacking though reassurance
measures or promises of rewards that make not going to war more
attractive; whether or not one calls this a form of deterrence per se,
it is nevertheless part of the deterrence process.]{.underline}13
Finally, and most important of all, [[deterrence happens in the mind of
the potential aggressor]{.underline}. [What the enemy believes about the
future is what matters]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and what the costs and
benefits of war will actually be are only relevant insofar as this
affects the enemy's thinking]{.underline}. Objective reality will of
course suddenly become very important if deterrence fails and war
begins. Since decision makers can misperceive reality for many reasons,
and because future events are often difficult to predict, many wars are
started by states that probably would have been better off if they had
not attacked.

### 2AC -- AT: Undo Trump CP

#### Rejoining the JCPOA is not an option

**[Kenyon 19]{.underline}** (Peter Kenyon is NPR\'s international
correspondent based in Istanbul, Turkey. 7-11-2019, \"What\'s The Deal
With The Iran Deal Now?,\" NPR.org,
https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/739943760/whats-the-deal-with-the-iran-deal-now)

A special meeting of the Vienna-based [International Atomic Energy
Agency Board of
Governors](https://www.iaea.org/about/governance/board-of-governors)
wrapped up Wednesday with no formal action on Iran\'s two recent
violations of the 2015 nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA. The
meeting let both the U.S. and Iran spell out their starkly different
views, and came amid continuing tensions: Iran has given Europe ---
which is attempting to get trade going with Iran --- a 60-day time frame
to save the nuclear deal, and President Trump threatened more sanctions
even as the IAEA meeting was taking place. On the same day, Iranian
boats attempted to seize a British tanker in the Persian Gulf. After
waiting some 14 months following President Trump\'s decision last year
to pull out of the JCPOA and re-impose sanctions, Iran began suspending
one of its commitments under the deal every 60 days. So far, Iran has
begun keeping more low-enriched uranium than the deal permits, and it\'s
enriching it at levels slightly higher than called for in the agreement.

Iran\'s IAEA Ambassador Kazim Gharib Abadi offered reporters a direct
response to Trump\'s demand that Iran return to the table and negotiate
a new, longer-lasting and more restrictive deal.

\"[[The JCPOA is not re-negotiable]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he said
Wednesday. \"[[No country is ready to negotiate with a country that is
putting a gun on its chest]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

Abadi said the U.S. call for this week\'s IAEA special meeting was not
well received among other delegations, adding that Washington had tried
to encourage other countries to call for the meeting, but was rebuffed.

The Russian response was sharp, delivered by Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov.

\"[The initiative to convene this extraordinary session came from [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates --- the country that has [declared the
JCPOA to be a \'terrible deal\']{.mark} and took the path of its
destruction,\"]{.underline} he said. \"In practice, it turns out that
Washington is aware of the importance of the plan and is seeking its
full implementation. Although for some reason, they only refer to
Tehran.\" A U.S. administration official, speaking with reporters on
background, acknowledged approaching other countries about calling the
meeting. In the end, he said, the U.S. decided to call the meeting
itself.

[The official added that there was strong support among IAEA board
members for the continued role of the IAEA, which has inspectors in Iran
monitoring the country\'s nuclear program. Officials call this a
\"state-of-the-art verification system,\" but in pulling out of the
JCPOA, [the Trump administration slammed it as not tough
enough]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The U.S. official said the board did agree to make public two reports by
[Director-General Yukiya
Amano](https://www.iaea.org/about/dg/biography), outlining some of
Iran\'s activities that had concerned Washington. Those concerns are not
likely to end soon, with Iran preparing to announce more violations in
another 60 days.

Iran focuses on Europe

\"As stated before by our high-ranking officials, including the
president and minister of foreign affairs,\" Abadi said, \"[[Iran will
cease]{.mark} some [parts]{.mark} of implementation [of its obligations
under the deal every 60 days]{.mark}, unless there\'s going to be
substantial progress made toward implementation of the obligations of
other remaining parties to the JCPOA, especially the European Union and
the E3.\"]{.underline}

The E3 refers to the three European signatories to the JCPOA --- Great
Britain, France and Germany. They have come up with an alternate payment
mechanism, the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges or INSTEX,
intended to allow trade with Iran without exposing European companies to
American sanctions.

To date, it\'s been used experimentally for food, medicine and other
basic transactions, but Abadi complains it has not been used enough.

U.S.: Don\'t allow Iranian \"extortion tactics\"

During the board of governors meeting, [[[U.S.]{.mark} Ambassador to the
IAEA Jackie
Wolcott]{.underline}](https://vienna.usmission.gov/our-relationship/our-ambassador/)
[[urged other members to]{.mark} join Washington in [cut]{.mark}ting
[off Iran\'s sources of revenue]{.mark}. Wolcott called on countries to
resist what she called Iran\'s \"brinkmanship and extortion
tactics,\"]{.underline} calling the recent Iranian nuclear violations a
deliberate and concerning expansion of its nuclear program.

While the meeting was going on, President Trump
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1148958770770382849)
that \"[Iran has long been secretly \'enriching\'\" in violation of the
\"terrible\" nuclear deal his administration reneged on]{.underline}.
\"Sanctions will soon be increased, substantially!\" he warned.

The U.S. official briefing reporters in Vienna refused to comment on the
president\'s tweet, but said it remained imperative for Iran to continue
to cooperate with the IAEA and its verification regime and reporting
requirements. Other officials have said additional sanctions against
Iran are likely.

Argentina\'s IAEA Ambassador Rafael Grossi says the U.S. and Iran have
worked themselves into a difficult position. [Iran is voicing a rather
generic demand of seeing economic benefits from staying in the deal,
\"which is very unlikely in the present circumstances,\" he
says.]{.underline}

\"So I don\'t see any way out of this,\" he says. \"The current
mitigation scheme \[INSTEX\] is really very insufficient in the eyes of
Iran.\"

Worst-case scenarios

Grossi sees the reactive nature of the dispute as \"very serious,\"
saying, \"You don\'t right a wrong with another wrong.\"

Longtime nonproliferation expert Laura Rockwood also sees gloomy
scenarios when she considers how this dispute might unfold.

\"I think if the Iranians go above 20% enriched uranium, it\'s going to
start making countries very, very nervous,\" she says.

Rockwood\'s worst-case scenario involves Iran walking out of the [Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons](https://www.iaea.org/publications/documents/treaties/npt),
which includes Tehran\'s pledge not to acquire nuclear weapons.

\"That would be a very bad signal,\" she says. \"I fear what the
consequences of that might be.\"

Another worst-case event would see Iran kicking out the IAEA inspectors,
a possibility the Iranian ambassador mentioned in his comments to
reporters.

Abadi says so far, [Tehran is making a clear distinction between
cooperating with the IAEA and sticking to its obligations under the
JCPOA.]{.underline}

[[Iran has stopped complying]{.mark} with some of its commitments under
the nuclear deal]{.underline}, he says, \"[but we [haven\'t touched our
cooperation with the agency]{.mark}. \... I hope that we will not reach
that point]{.underline}.\"

#### The counterplan removes the Executive Order on AI -- China fills in and gains hegemony & military superiority -- turns the cp

[exec]{.mark}utive
[order]{.mark}](https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-executive-order-artificial-intelligence)
[regarding]{.mark} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.mark}]{.underline}).
Darrell West from Brookings

a brief analysis of the order, Caleb Watney from R Street
[critiqued](https://www.lawfareblog.com/trumps-artificial-intelligence-strategy-aspirations-without-teeth)
it on Lawfare, and major media outlets have provided some reporting and
[commentary](https://www.wired.com/story/what-trumps-executive-order-on-ai-is-missing/)
on the rollout. Rather than repeat what the order says or what others
have said about it, below are three compliments and three concerns based
on my initial review of the order.

First, here are three things I like:

1\. The president actually issued the order. [No one is really sure
exactly how transformative AI will be---[there is a lot of potential in
AI]{.mark}, but there is also a lot of hype. But [because AI might have
major impacts on the economy, national security and other facets of
society]{.mark}, society needs to stay focused on it. Other
countries---especially [China]{.mark}---[are investing heavily in AI and
related fields]{.mark}, such as high-speed computing, sensors and
robotics (including autonomous vehicles and weapons systems). [The U.S.
D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense [and elements of the
U.S. intelligence community seem to be fully seized of the AI
issue]{.mark} and are actively pursuing an array of initiatives in the
field.]{.underline}

[The]{.mark} executive [order]{.mark} clearly [[recognizes the]{.mark}
potentially [significant implications of AI for the U.S. economy and
national security, and posits that the United States must be an AI
leader]{.mark}]{.underline}. The order declares: "It is the [[policy of
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates Government [to sustain and enhance
the scientific]{.mark}, technological, and economic [leadership position
of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in AI R&D]{.mark} and deployment
through a coordinated Federal Government strategy."]{.underline} If this
vision is implemented fully (a big "if"), maintaining and enhancing U.S.
leadership on AI would be a major policy achievement. The executive
order thus prioritizes AI for federal departments and agencies and
establishes a multifaceted framework for the executive branch to
implement the administration's AI policy. This is good.

Executive orders have the potential to focus bureaucracies in ways that
other executive pronouncements (such as tweets) do not. But realizing
that potential will require sustained leadership and commitment from the
White House. I expect that over the coming months there will be numerous
follow-up meetings and working groups established across the executive
branch to implement the executive order. All of that is good and, if
done right, will maintain needed federal focus on the AI issue.

2\. The link between AI and big data. [[Numerous provisions in the
exec]{.mark}utive [order address the link between AI and big
data]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, one of the strategic objectives
set forth in the order is the following: "Enhance access to high-quality
and fully traceable Federal data, models, and computing resources to
increase the value of such resources for AI R&D, while maintaining
safety, security, privacy, and confidentiality protections consistent
with applicable laws and policies." [This is important. AI algorithms
learn from having access to relevant data. The more data made
accessible, the more learning can occur]{.underline}. Exactly how all of
this learning happens is complex and messy, and real success is hard to
achieve. But the point is that in order to improve our AI systems, we
need to provide developers with lawful access to large datasets.

Many directives in the order, like the one above, encourage government
agencies to make data that they possess accessible to AI scientists and
developers in ways that protect privacy (more on privacy below). [China
has a disproportionate advantage over other countries]{.underline} in
terms of the volume of data about human behavior to which its AI
developers have access because of its intensive (and repressive)
collection of data about the activities of its very large population and
its likely theft of data from countries around the world[. [If we expect
to keep up with China, it makes sense for the administration]{.mark} to
[encourage U.S. government departments]{.mark} and agencies [to make
more of their data available to U.S.-based AI
developers.]{.mark}]{.underline}

3\. [[Protect]{.mark}ing [the AI assets of the U.S. and its
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. For some time, I have been particularly
concerned that [[the U.S. government is inadequately protecting its AI
assets]{.underline}]{.mark}---people, technology, data---and those of
its allies [[from serious threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. (I wrote about
that concern last year in a four-part series on Lawfare: [Part
I](https://www.lawfareblog.com/artificial-intelligence-counterintelligence-perspective-part-1),
[Part
II](https://www.lawfareblog.com/artificial-intelligence-counterintelligence-perspective-part-ii),
[Part
III](https://www.lawfareblog.com/counterintelligence-implications-artificial-intelligence-part-iii)and
[Part
IV](https://www.lawfareblog.com/artificial-intelligence-%E2%80%93-counterintelligence-perspective-part-iv).)
The executive order rightly discusses the need for federal departments
and agencies to protect those assets. One of the five principles that
guide the policy set forth in the executive order includes the goal of
"protecting our critical AI technologies from acquisition by strategic
competitors and adversarial nations." Indeed, doing so is essential for
the long-term national security and economic well-being of the United
States. A related objective the order describes is to "\[e\]nsure that
technical standards \[developed by the federal government pursuant to
the order\] minimize vulnerability to attacks from malicious actors."
Protecting the integrity of AI technology from a physical and
cybersecurity perspective is also essential in order to make sure that
our AI systems work as intended.

In addition, the order requires that federal agencies implementing it:

Develop and implement an action plan, in accordance with the National
Security Presidential Memorandum of February 11, 2019 (Protecting the
United States Advantage in Artificial Intelligence and Related Critical
Technologies) (the NSPM) to protect the advantage of the United States
in AI and technology critical to United States economic and national
security interests against strategic competitors and foreign
adversaries.

The administration has not publicized the NSPM, but its name and the
language of this objective further suggest that the White House is
taking seriously its obligation to protect the country's AI assets. The
order also includes the following section specifically focused on
securing the country's AI assets:

Sec. 8. Action Plan for Protection of the United States Advantage in AI
Technologies.

\(a\) As directed by the NSPM, the Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs, in coordination with the OSTP Director and
the recipients of the NSPM, shall organize the development of an action
plan to protect the United States advantage in AI and AI technology
critical to United States economic and national security interests
against strategic competitors and adversarial nations.

\(b\) The action plan shall be provided to the President within 120 days
of the date of this order, and may be classified in full or in part, as
appropriate.

\(c\) Upon approval by the President, the action plan shall be
implemented by all agencies who are recipients of the NSPM, for all
AI-related activities, including those conducted pursuant to this order.

Relevant agencies of course need to devote the appropriate time, effort
and resources to safeguard the United States' AI assets. And in addition
to protecting technology, they must focus on protecting the people who
have relevant AI expertise and making sure that our immigration policies
allow us to attract, educate and retain the best AI minds in the world.
The government must also consider carefully the second- and third-order
consequences of any actions it takes to protect U.S. AI assets, such as
avoiding economic protectionism under the banner of protecting
U.S.-based AI capability. But the overall policy highlights the
importance of the AI security issue, and that makes a lot of sense.

A seated President Trump [handed commemorative pens to his wife,
daughter and eight others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqa54Nd8kBk)
who hovered around his desk, then theatrically held up for the cameras
the latest executive order bearing his oversize signature.

He had done "something that people have wanted presidents to do for a
long time," a triumphant Trump told the applauding military families who
packed the White House East Room. "[[We will]{.mark} now [ensure that
you have better access to]{.mark} federal [jobs]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Yet 11 months later, [[the [four-page
document](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-enhancing-noncompetitive-civil-service-appointments-military-spouses/)
he signed in May did no such thing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The order provided no money]{.mark}, created no policies and added no
hiring authority. [It merely required federal officials to post notices
on their websites]{.mark} and draft reports about [an order signed a
decade earlier by President George W.
Bush](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080926-8.html),
which allowed agencies to waive competitive hiring requirements for
military spouses in some circumstances]{.underline}.

The substance mattered little, however. [[For a president who relishes
pomp and shows of exec]{.mark}utive [action, unchecked by
Congress]{.mark}, [signing ceremonies have]{.mark} [[become a]{.mark}
[hallmark]{.mark}, a way to convey
accomplishment](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-executive-orders-20170416-story.html)
for a man who asserts he has done more than any president in
history.]{.underline}

The Times reviewed [101 executive
orders](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2019)
Trump has signed since inauguration day, and interviewed experts,
advocates and administration officials about their effects. Many were
geared toward favored political constituencies, including veterans,
blue-collar workers and [evangelical
Christians](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-religious-order-20170504-story.html).
Few moved policy significantly; generally the orders created committees
or task forces, demanded reports or pressed for enforcement of existing
laws.

[[Trump's boldest unilateral actions]{.mark}, the ones that have
provoked the most vigorous objections to his use of presidential power,
[were not carried out through executive orders]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[He]{.mark} [did initially sign two exec]{.mark}utive [orders to
fulfill his campaign pledge to ban all Muslims from entering the
country, but courts struck both down]{.mark}]{.underline}. A third
version, revised again to pass court muster, was written as a
proclamation; it was [upheld by the Supreme
Court](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-court-trump-travel-20180626-story.html).

his Feb. 15 declaration of a national
emergency.](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-emergency-20190215-story.html)

The president's executive orders are usually more modest, though
Americans wouldn't know it from the ceremonies the White House stages.

Many orders seek action from Cabinet secretaries, something Trump could
easily accomplish with a phone call.

"You don't really need an executive order for a lot of this stuff, but
it makes for a good show," said Elaine Kamarck, a Clinton administration
veteran who is the director of the Center for Effective Public
Management at the Brookings Institution.

"He even gives out pens, which is really sort of ridiculous," she added,
noting that past presidents reserved that tradition for signing
momentous laws like the Civil Rights Act.

White House officials argue that Trump's orders focus agency leaders on
his priorities and that ultimately some have had broad impact, including
the reduction of regulations across the federal government and the
expanded availability of less expensive health plans that don't offer a
full set of benefits.

The formality of a written order, they say, can command attention across
government.

[The question is not whether Trump's rhetoric "aligns with the legal
language" in the orders, the White House said in a written response.
Rather, the statement added, it's what they have accomplished --- "And
they've done a lot!"]{.underline}

The Times review shows a different picture. A few of Trump's orders have
led to changes in policy. Many, however, have proved more ceremonial
than substantive.

At least 18 of the 101 orders created new task forces, councils or
committees. Among them was an infrastructure council that disbanded
within a month; members resigned in 2017 after Trump's qualified
criticism of white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville, Va. He
issued two orders related to his unfounded claims of widespread voter
fraud: One established a commission, the other disbanded it after
bipartisan criticism.

At least 12 included language such as "encourage" or "to the extent
permitted by law," underscoring the president's lack of authority to
make sweeping change without help from Congress.

At least 15 reversed or curtailed Obama's initiatives, notably the
orders overturning environmental regulations. Those made for some of
Trump's most consequential actions even as they demonstrated a major
drawback of executive orders --- they can fairly easily be undone by a
successor. Also, courts have blocked some environmental rollbacks.

At least 43 called for agency reports or reviews, including one on
historically black colleges and another on retirement savings rules. A
few in this category led to significant changes, such as Trump's order
sharply shrinking the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears national
monuments in Utah that Presidents Clinton and Obama, respectively, had
established.

At least five related to members of the military, veterans and their
families. Two called for plans and task forces on mental health and
suicide among veterans. One established an accountability office at the
Department of Veterans Affairs.

A fourth purported to create a job training program for veterans to
enter the U.S. Merchant Marine, but it duplicated an existing "Military
to Mariner" program. It "complements what we're doing," Coast Guard Lt.
Amy Midgett said.

In several cases, [[Trump has made broad claims about the impact of
his]{.mark} executive [orders that have proved false]{.mark}. He has
repeatedly claimed that two of his orders require American-made steel in
federal pipelines. In reality, they simply encouraged federal agencies
to choose American companies for the product.]{.underline}

The order Trump signed on Inauguration Day, "to ease the economic
burden" of President Obama's healthcare law, was similarly toothless.
Yet another told federal education officials to follow existing laws
respecting local and state boards' independence.

[Trump's 100th executive order, signed Thursday in an East Room event
complete with a string quartet, followed up on a promise he made earlier
in the month to a conservative conference, promising to force colleges
to support free speech.]{.underline}

Trump called it "historic" and "groundbreaking." [[Experts who read the
text afterward said the ultimate impact was uncertain]{.mark}, given
that public universities already must follow the 1st Amendment and it
simply instructed private colleges to comply with their existing
policies.]{.underline}

An official who briefed reporters beforehand struggled to explain the
order and how the administration would enforce it.

Some of the orders seemed to have little purpose. One replaced the
"White House Rural Council" with the "Interagency Task Force on
Agriculture and Rural Prosperity" and two renamed a financial fraud task
force and a council on physical fitness.

Another --- one of the five related to the military --- was the order
for employing military spouses that simply promoted an existing
program[. [It demonstrated that]{.mark}, for beneficiaries, [executive
orders can be a mixed blessing]{.mark} --- bringing attention to issues
but inviting complacency that the issues have been
addressed.]{.underline}

"There was definitely quite a bit of excitement out there" about the
military spouses order, "but what I was personally concerned about was
that excitement leading to a 'check the box' mentality," said Jennifer
Akin, an applied research analyst for Blue Star Families, a military
family advocacy organization.

Akin said the order brought needed attention to the issue but failed to
address bigger obstacles, such as poor child-care options for military
spouses.

Another favorite of Trump's are his "buy American" orders.

After signing his first one in April 2017, [[he claimed at political
rallies that it would require]{.mark} the Keystone XL and Dakota Access
[pipelines to be built with American steel. It did not.]{.mark} The
order stated a broad goal and required the Commerce secretary to write a
report.]{.underline}

Signing a second such order earlier this year, he insisted at a White
House ceremony that the first was "having an incredible effect" on jobs
for steel workers. The second order, to "encourage" agencies to use U.S.
products "to the extent consistent with law," has had no more impact
than the first.

"I could encourage my kids to go to bed; doesn't mean they will," said
Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which
represents steel workers and manufacturers. "It's highly unlikely that
an aspirational statement is going to produce actual jobs."

Paul noted that Trump has senior advisors and Cabinet officials who have
a record of opposing such requirements, including his acting chief of
staff, Mick Mulvaney, and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.

Experts say Trump's inability to stock his administration with
experienced officials can diminish the impact of his orders; it takes
committed, loyal advisors to oversee the laborious rule-making processes
at government agencies.

"If you want it to actually happen, you've got to have people in the
department who know what they're doing," said Kamarck.

Trump is hardly the first president to use executive orders to attempt
to bypass Congress. Obama, frustrated by a Republican-controlled
Congress' obstruction in his final years, famously spoke of his desire
to use a "pen and phone" to bypass Capitol Hill. Yet he seldom held
signing ceremonies or made the kind of grand claims Trump has made.

Trump and his advisors speak often of his impatience with the
legislative process, though he spent his first two years with a Congress
run by his own party. After his first 100 days, he boasted that his
signed orders were central to his ["historic
accomplishments."](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-trumps-100-days-historic-accomplishments/)

At the American Farm Bureau convention in Nashville last year, Trump
hailed the "millions of hardworking Americans, completely forgotten,"
and told the excited crowd that he had heard that broadband internet
access was "a vital concern." Then he pulled out a pen to sign "the
first step to expand access to broadband internet in rural America ---
so you can compete on a level playing field."

The crowd roared. Yet again, the order was modest, directing agencies to
review procedures for placing private cell towers on public lands.

Christopher Mitchell, director of the Community Broadband Networks
Initiative, said it has had practically no impact for the tens of
millions of Americans who lack broadband.

"It's not unlike trying to bail out a cruise liner with a pint glass,"
he said. "These executive orders seem to be more about appearing to do
something than really do something."

As a rule, [[when]{.mark} Donald [Trump signs an executive order,
there's reason for concern]{.mark} about abuses and regressive steps
backward. Today, [however, the president appears to have done [something
worthwhile](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-order-overhaul-kidney-disease-program-n1028141)]{.mark}--
though he neglected to mention an important detail.]{.underline}

President Donald [[Trump signed an exec]{.mark}utive [order directing
the gov]{.mark}ernment [to revamp the nation's care]{.mark} for kidney
disease so that more people whose kidneys fail have a chance at early
transplants and home dialysis.]{.underline}

Trump said his [order was intended to increase the supply of donated
kidneys]{.underline}, make it easier for patients to undergo dialysis in
the comfort of their own homes and prioritize the development of an
artificial kidney.

This is the first of several steps, though as Vox's
[piece](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/10/20687507/triump-kidney-disease-transplant)
noted, [[the administration's new policy "would make it easier for
living donors]{.mark} to give kidneys and other organs, [promote the
donation]{.mark} of organs from deceased people, [and restructure
payment for health care providers]{.mark} to reduce the rate of kidney
failure in the first place."]{.underline}

On balance, it looks like [[this]{.mark} executive [order is a genuinely
good idea]{.mark}]{.underline}. I guess Trump is helping prove the
[broken-clock theory](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Stopped_clock).

In fact, the president's policy has so much merit, I'm not even going to
mention his [odd
remarks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-advancing-american-kidney-health/)
about the executive order, including his assertion, "The kidney has a
very special place in the heart." It'd be easy to have a little fun with
that, but I won't.

I am, however, inclined to shine a light on a relevant detail Trump
neglected to mention: [[he's piggybacking on the A]{.mark}ffordable
[C]{.mark}are [A]{.mark}ct.]{.underline}

As Dan Diamond
[explained](https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/1148929967847288832),
the president's new strategy "wouldn't be possible without Obamacare."

That's undeniably true. As the Associated Press
[reported](https://www.apnews.com/9703ade402c94f27b7d1c2c4d585049b),
"[These changes are being implemented through Medicare's innovation
center, created under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act and empowered to
seek savings and improved quality. [The Trump administration is relying
on the innovation center]{.mark} even as it argues in federal court that
the law that created it is unconstitutional and should be struck down
entirely]{.underline}."

[In order [to expand]{.mark}]{.underline}, digital [[businesses need to
pivot to new]{.mark} and promising [growth
areas]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Often that means making forays into
new fields and taking on seemingly intractable business problems.
[[Consider]{.mark} Google's venture into maps or SAP's [Future
Factory](http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/about/our-company/innovation/living-labs/future-factory.html)
initiative, [far-reaching projects that required new ideas from
different places]{.mark}. [The development of new tech]{.mark}nologies
[is]{.mark} complex and [challenging, and]{.mark} to come up with the
next big innovation, [businesses must think --- and operate --- in new
ways.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Given these challenges, [[it's surprising to see]{.mark} younger [firms
trying to grow by tapping the same R&D resources that fueled their
initial successes]{.mark}. Facebook and Salesforce.com, for example,
conduct much of their R&D locally. Like a lot of young digital companies
in the U.S., [there is little evidence that they harness knowledge in
fast-growing global centers of excellence]{.mark} such as Bangalore or
Tel Aviv. However, [in order to grow, companies need to draw on the
world's best knowledge, wherever it lives
geographically.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Over the past two decades, [we have seen a shift in the way R&D is
dispersed around the world]{.underline}. Traditionally, [multinationals
have conducted their research in developed nations: IBM has an R&D
center in Tokyo, for example, and Google's European engineering hub is
in Zurich.]{.underline} But more recently, emerging-market locations
have featured prominently in global firms' technology portfolios.
Multinationals' knowledge-intensive activities have set in motion
virtuous cycles that have resulted in the development of innovation
clusters in places including Shanghai and the aforementioned cities in
India and Israel.

What is so important about this trend is that global knowledge networks
increasingly braid together R&D activities conducted in advanced and
emerging economy locations. As the Economist Intelligence Unit has
noted, [[emerging-market
R&D](http://www.economistinsights.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Coming%20of%20age%20Asias%20evolving%20RnD%20landscape_WEB.pdf)
is taking the lead on global projects because it has the best ideas to
offer, rather than the cheapest. In our research, we call this
["competence-creating"
work](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.497/abstract)]{.underline}.
The more ideas that are brought to bear, the better chance companies
have of solving big problems, and in a connected world, those ideas can
come from a variety of places. As Julian Birkinshaw and Neil Hood noted
in the pages of HBR, [distance may actually be an
asset](https://hbr.org/2001/03/unleash-innovation-in-foreign-subsidiaries).

[The global search for ideas is especially important for digital
businesses. When we examine the patents of a series of established
digital-technology companies, a clear pattern emerges: Certain
[companies rely on globally dispersed R&D far]{.mark} more than others.
[The more software-driven the company, the greater the reach into global
R&D networks]{.mark}. To us, that demonstrates that all digital
companies have an enormous opportunity as they mature and look to
develop new areas of technology.]{.underline}

To be sure, a number of highly successful American companies have
managed to pivot to new directions while keeping their R&D close to
home. Apple's design studio is nestled snugly in its Cupertino,
California, campus. Autodesk tries out manufacturing prototypes on
wholly owned factory floors in Manhattan. Our research on patents shows
that fewer than 5% of Apple's and Autodesk's patents list inventors
outside the U.S. (see the chart).

By contrast, Symantec (which is all digital) and SAP (whose businesses
have both physical and digital components) source knowledge much more
widely and draw on emerging-market locations. Nearly a quarter of
Symantec's, and more than 10% of SAP's, patents come from outside the
U.S., our research shows. And the vast majority of those patents come
from emerging markets.

[Symantec's Centre of Innovation in Chennai, India, was conceived of not
as an outpost of local adaptation but as a source of new-product
innovation for the company as a whole. The company's stance on
innovation is truly global, with engineering teams collaborating among
its network of locations. [The Indian location was attractive on account
of its strong engineering talent]{.mark}. A few years ago, a Symantec
VP, Shantanu Ghosh, pointed out the "amount of [true
innovation](http://www.symantec.com/en/in/about/news/release/article.jsp?prid=20130513_01)
from our India Innovation Centers."]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [SAP has been cultivating a worldwide R&D network through its
Global Ecosystem program, sourcing ideas from geographically dispersed
individuals and organizations and promoting diversity]{.underline}. The
R&D coming out of SAP's emerging-market locations has global
significance: Its technology center in Tel Aviv has leaped to the
forefront of innovation. SAP's co-CEO Jim Hagemann noted in 2011 that
the R&D group in Israel has "turned into a sort of front line where [new
ideas are tested](http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000698414) out and
turned into technology, and it is succeeding well."

Indeed, firms whose products are mainly intangible have the geographic
flexibility to draw on knowledge from all over the world. Because their
businesses don't rely on physical materials such as tangible prototypes
and lab equipment, collaborating scientists don't need to be physically
colocated.

[Yet there's a group of young U.S. digital businesses]{.underline} that,
while often growing at breakneck speed, [haven't embraced the promise of
globally dispersed knowledge; their R&D is still highly
localized.]{.underline} In our research we explored a series of such
young firms, from those on the cusp of exploration (Facebook,
Salesforce.com, and LinkedIn) to a series of "unicorns": fast-growing
start-ups such as Dropbox and DocuSign that have reached valuations
north of \$1 billion. The common thread among them? None have yet seized
the opportunity that global knowledge hotspots can provide.

[Facebook has recently looked beyond Silicon Valley, but its research
remains in the developed world]{.underline}. Its London office, which
represents its first international move, has [a mandate to
mirror](http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/facebook-rd-goes-global-opens-engineering-office-in-london-its-first-outside-the-u-s/)
the engineering undertaken at HQ. Salesforce.com, as a cloud-based
service provider, believes in [platform-driven R&D
efficiencies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2011/03/16/salesforce-com-worth-128-if-it-doesnt-overspend-on-rd/),
which demand a centralized engineering approach.

Emerging markets present their own challenges, of course. Companies risk
rapid staff turnover and the leakage of key knowledge. Distance
(cultural, geographic, technological) could lead to substandard work. [A
2011 McKinsey study showed that smaller and younger firms are wary of
global R&D plays.]{.underline} However, the same study showed that the
challenges were well worth it: [[All high performing companies in the
study [did at least some R&D
abroad](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/operations/r_and_38d_strategies_in_emerging_economies_mckinsey_global_survey_results)]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Ultimately these companies will face important decisions regarding idea
exploration. [[Growth requires]{.mark} a broad set of [new
ideas]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our research suggests that they will have to
reach beyond technological capabilities and learn how to deal with the
challenges of global knowledge sourcing --- including addressing the
many problems they will confront in emerging markets.

After a morning [innovation workshop at the bucolic R&D campus of a
top-tier but tradition-rich technology giant, the lunchtime conversation
with the Lab's leadership turned strategic[. A]{.mark} charismatic
[CEO]{.mark}, imported from outside the industry, [was making bold,
expensive investments in new markets]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result,
[[Labs management was being asked to do more with
less.]{.underline}]{.mark} What should they do? How should they better
prioritize innovation?

I answered their obvious questions with my own: [What new innovation
initiatives had they launched, and what dedicated team had they
organized, to explicitly support their CEO's high-profile moves toward
diversification]{.underline}?

Silence. With the exception of the firm's venture arm looking at a few
external start-up options, [no formal or informal Lab groups were
directly working on their CEO's newly declared priorities. "We're really
not budgeted for that," the leadership team explained.]{.underline}

These Labs were filled with talented technologists and innovators. But
nobody owned the challenge --- and opportunity --- of aligning them with
the CEO's ambitions.

[[When CEOs publicly communicate new directions]{.mark} and priorities
for their enterprises, [that needn't marginalize existing R&D and
innovation efforts]{.mark}.]{.underline} But it strongly suggests
resources be dedicated to making those CEO visions achievable.

[[Ensuring that the company's innovation culture and pipeline reflect
the CEO's vision]{.mark} and priorities [poses]{.mark} few [problems
for]{.mark} companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, or Tesla. The
challenges are tougher for [more established organizations where CEOs
may publicly value consistent incremental efficiencies over new value
creation]{.mark} and new markets.]{.underline} There, innovators need to
be better attuned to the tone at the top.

Take Boeing. After a series of expensive problems with its Dreamliner
development, its [CEO, [Jim
McNerney](http://topics.wsj.com/person/M/Jim-McNerney/712), revised the
company's innovation ethos, declaring its era of [boundary-pushing "moon
shots"
over](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303749904579576051459153662)]{.underline}.
"Airlines," he concluded, "don't want to pay more for advanced
technology."

"[[It's not to say you don't innovate]{.mark}," explained [Raymond
Conner](http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-boeing-innovation-means-small-steps-not-giant-leaps-1428016900),
Vice Chairman of Boeing and President and CEO of Boeing Commerical
Airplanes. He wants engineers "innovating more on how to \[design jets\]
more simplistically, as opposed to driving more complexity... How do you
innovate to make it more producible? How do you innovate to make it more
reliable?"]{.underline}

Whether they agree or disagree, Boeing engineers and innovators would be
wise to focus on [[innovations instantly recognizable as
simpler]{.mark}, easier to produce, and more reliable for commercial
aviation. [And that needn't eradicate the company's technical prowess
and reputation as an aerospace pioneer.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Quarterly calls are good opportunities to ensure alignment. What would
inspire the CFO or CEO to talk to investors about a major innovation
underway? How does the project make tangible an idea the CEO raised a
quarter or more ago? How might it enhance executive credibility even as
it provokes disruption in the marketplace?

nuclear deal*

REPAIRING THE DAMAGE: THE U.S. RETURN TO THE JCPOA

The incoming [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and a successor
administration [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} respectively [halt and
[repair]{.mark}]{.underline} much of the [[damage]{.mark} from Trump's
JCPOA exit [by signaling]{.mark} the [political will and intent]{.mark}
for the U.S. [to re-enter the JCPOA]{.mark}'s fold [and resume
obligations]{.mark}]{.underline} thereto, including via the lifting of
nuclear-related sanctions.

**[[Resuming commitments]{.mark} under the JCPOA would deliver profound
benefits for the U.S. national interest]{.underline}**. First, [it
[would **signal to the world**]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[the U.S. is
a responsible actor]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the international arena;
[the U.S. **[intends to live up to]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[political agreements]{.underline}]{.mark}** that it makes [with
other countries]{.underline}; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}
nothing more than [[an unfortunate aberration]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the American political system. [Nothing has caused more serious
damage]{.underline} to U.S. interests [than]{.underline} the [growing
trust deficit]{.underline} towards the United States. If states are
unable to trust the United States, then not only is U.S. global
leadership severely undermined but the international system that has
been predominate since the end of the Second World War risks unraveling.
[By]{.underline} clearly [showing the world]{.underline} that [the U.S.
intends to fully observe]{.underline} the [commitments]{.underline} that
it makes, a successor [administration can]{.underline} begin to
[repair]{.underline} the [damage]{.underline} wrought by President
Trump.

Second, the U.S.'s [[re-entrance]{.mark} into the JCPOA]{.underline}
[**[would have]{.mark}**]{.underline} important
**[[non-prolif]{.mark}eration [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}** by
effectively disincentivizing Iran from exiting the JCPOA itself and thus
undoing the risk of a burgeoning nuclear crisis in the Middle East. In
so doing, the U.S. would ensure the survivability of the tough and
far-reaching constraints on Iran's nuclear program that will be imposed
by the JCPOA through 2030 and beyond. Iran's nuclear program does not
pose the risks it did in the pre-2015 era, and that is fully thanks to
the JCPOA and the restrictions it imposes. Any policymaker should be
eager to return to the JCPOA and, in so doing, re-secure hard-fought
concessions that take an Iranian nuclear weapon and war with Iran over
its nuclear program off the table for the foreseeable future.

Third, [reentry]{.underline} to the JCPOA **[[would signal to]{.mark}
the kingdom of [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline}** that Donald
**[Trump's [blank check]{.mark}]{.underline}** for their increasingly
brazen behavior **[[is at an end]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and that the
U.S. has alternatives to outsourcing American policy in the region to an
erratic kingdom that -- in the words of Sen. Lindsey Graham -- has
double dealt on terror. Perversely, both the Trump administration and
numerous Washington pressure groups have warned that the
administration's pressure campaign against Iran would be jeopardized if
the U.S. dared to impose consequences on the kingdom over the brutal
murder of Saudi journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi. Such
warnings expose the current administration's approach to the region as
so hopelessly unbalanced that is susceptible to extortion by one morally
bankrupt regime against another. [[The U.S. needs to move to a]{.mark}
transactional [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} with both Saudi Arabia
and Iran [[where we can impose consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} on each
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} such [brazen
[misbehavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Iran, the U.S. has sanctioned
itself out of influence, whereas with Saudi Arabia the U.S. is too
afraid to use its substantial leverage to rein in the kingdom's
destructive course -- whether on the disastrous war in Yemen or on the
kingdom's mounting human rights abuses. [An alternative is available,
and **it should start with re-entry to the JCPOA.**]{.underline}

Finally, [U.S. participation]{.underline} in the JCPOA Joint Commission
[[**would guarantee diplomacy with Iran** that does not]{.mark}
presently [exist]{.mark}]{.underline} amid the administration's pressure
campaign, [[and could lead to]{.mark} follow-on [negotiations
addressing]{.mark}]{.underline} the full spectrum of [[America's
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} with Iran -- [including regional security
and human rights]{.underline}. The present Trump administration approach
of exiting the JCPOA and seeking its destruction prohibits the U.S. from
affecting Iran's calculations on issues beyond the nuclear file. Any
policymaker with justifiable concerns with Iranian behavior or who seeks
political solutions to the proxy conflicts that have gripped the region
should be urging a return to the JCPOA.

[[Returning]{.mark} to the JCPOA]{.underline} and restoring U.S.
credibility and influence with Iran [[is unlikely to be without cost,
but]{.mark} will [not]{.mark} be]{.underline} nearly [[as costly as the
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. reneged on its commitments
and, barring Congressional intervention or a change of heart from
President Trump himself, will have materially breached the accord by
snapping back nuclear-related sanctions for a period of at least 32
months if there is a change in administration after the 2020 elections.
Judging by recent sanctions designations, as well, the Trump
administration does not appear intent to sit idly in the months ahead,
but will proceed with a dramatic expansion of sanctions designations
that may go well beyond previous sanctions campaigns. These will have a
tremendous negative effect on the Iranian economy and the Iranian
people's aspirations, in addition to the economies of our allies in
Europe seeking to comply with the UNSC-endorsed JCPOA.

**[Shapiro 18]{.underline}** \[Jacob L. Shapiro, geopolitical analyst
who explains and predicts global trends, director of analysis for
Geopolitical Futures, 5-30-2018, \"A Conversation About US
Credibility,\" Geopolitical Futures, accessed 7-22-2019,
https://geopoliticalfutures.com/conversation-u-s-credibility/ \]

The limitations of this approach can be observed clearly in a debate
raging over the importance of U.S. "credibility" in the world. [[The
U.S.]{.mark} made three major fo]{.underline}reign [po]{.underline}licy
[moves]{.underline} this month: It [[pulled out of]{.mark} the **[Iran
nuclear deal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it has been **[inconsistent on
trade disputes with China]{.underline}**, [[and
**canceled**]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least
[[temporarily]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[a]{.mark} planned **[summit with
Kim Jong Un]{.mark}**]{.underline} next month. In both the U.S. and
abroad, [it is]{.underline} becoming a [common]{.underline} refrain [to
hear]{.underline} that [[U.S. **cred**]{.mark}ibility]{.underline}
**[[has been damaged as a result]{.underline}]{.mark}** of these moves,
and that this has the effect of eroding U.S. power and creating more
geopolitical instability.

Determining whether this is true is more difficult than it may seem.
After all, how does one measure credibility? We could survey a large
sample of people in a foreign country and ask whether it is commonly
believed that the U.S. will follow through on its promises, but the
results would be imprecise -- and mostly irrelevant. Answers would vary
based on the issue, and more important, it's foreign governments, not
their citizens, that must decide whether the U.S. is trustworthy after
the foreign policy decisions of this month.

And Americans themselves are unreliable judges of U.S. credibility
abroad because of the political history of the term in America. The
credibility question was ubiquitous in the 1960s not because of the
United States' relationship with foreign governments but because a
"credibility gap" opened up between the Lyndon B. Johnson government and
the American electorate. The Johnson government relied on key statistics
(like "body count") to claim that the U.S. was winning the Vietnam War
even as the situation was getting no better. Richard Nixon's Watergate
scandal widened the trust gap still further. Ironically, when Americans
refer to the credibility of the U.S. abroad, they are often projecting
their own lack of confidence in their government onto others.

Yet despite the shapelessness of the term credibility, and despite the
political landmines surrounding discussions of it, it is not a
discussion that can be avoided. The reliability of U.S. promises is not
an academic question. The U.S. became involved in the Vietnam War
precisely because it feared the implications for its containment policy
against the Soviet Union if it allowed Vietnam to fall into communist
hands. What was at stake was not so much Vietnam but the value of a U.S.
security guarantee. The same is true, albeit on a much smaller scale, of
Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia. Russia was not interested in
conquering Georgia so much as it was interested in demonstrating that a
U.S. security guarantee was worthless, and therefore that countries in
the Caucasus would do well to make their peace with a resurgent Moscow.

[[Credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[is as much perception
as]{.underline}]{.mark} it is [[reality]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The Iran
nuclear deal is a]{.underline} useful [example]{.underline}. The stated
goal of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (as it is officially
known) was to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But the U.S.
and Iran each conceived of the JCPOA in very different terms. The U.S.
wanted a willing partner in the fight against the Islamic State. It got
a partner that was too willing, because after IS was all but defeated,
Iran aggressively pushed into the region and began testing missiles.
Iran wanted to rejoin the global economy and secure legitimacy for its
foreign policy moves in the region. The deal was concluded by two weak
administrations, and in the U.S. it wasn't even given the status of a
treaty, meaning it was easy to cancel.

Those who advocate remaining in the JCPOA argue that **[[leaving the
deal is catastrophic for U.S. credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They
find useful [[corroboration]{.mark} of this position [from **Iran's
president**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for whom the U.S. withdrawal is
disastrous, [[and]{.mark} from **[European
leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline} who are primarily interested in buying
cheap Iranian oil. Those who advocated leaving the deal think that Iran
is a menace with no credibility of its own and that it is better to take
the hit to U.S. credibility than to remain in a political arrangement
that empowers a U.S. adversary. It's hard to argue that U.S. credibility
has been damaged while Iran is trying to buy the Iraqi election and is
building bases on the Israeli border.

The U.S.-North Korea issue is different, if less immediately weighty.
The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [appeared poised for a
summit with Kim Jong Un]{.underline}, [only to
[withdraw]{.mark}]{.underline} from the summit [[via a letter that
boasted of the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates' own [[nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark} and gave the primary reason for the
cancelation to be the "tremendous anger and open hostility" of recent
North Korean statements. The Trump letter came days after the U.S.
insinuated that Libya was a good model for North Korean
denuclearization, an eyebrow-raising suggestion considering the U.S.
helped topple Moammar Gadhafi's regime in Libya in 2011. Now the U.S.
and North Korea are talking again, and the summit may be back on -- or
it may not. The whole issue has become a farce.

But [[it]{.mark} is a farce that [could be **damaging to U.S.
cred**]{.mark}**ibility**]{.underline}. North Korea released U.S.
prisoners, toned down its criticism of U.S.-South Korea military
exercises, and appeared to dismantle a nuclear test site. Though Iran,
strictly speaking, was not violating the terms of its deal with the
U.S., Washington could at least point to violations of the spirit of the
agreement. Not so with North Korea.

[The U.S. has also been losing the]{.underline} larger [[credibility
battle in **East Asia**]{.underline}]{.mark}. U.S. credibility in the
region won't rise and fall depending on whether Trump and Kim share a
cheeseburger, but [**[it matters whether countries]{.mark} in the
region** **[trust the U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. And on this issue, [[No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline} already achieved a major objective months
ago when it [[exposed deep cracks]{.mark} in the U.S.-South Korea
security relationship [by pushing the U.S. to the brink of a]{.mark}
military [strike]{.mark}]{.underline}. North Korea also successfully
demonstrated to U.S. allies like Japan that U.S. resolve in halting
North Korea's nuclear program is mainly rhetorical.

What this all really comes down to is that the United States is at the
center of the world order, and **[[when the United States acts in ways
that other countries don't like]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or that
political factions within the U.S. don't like[**), [it]{.mark}** often
**[manifests as the weakening of U.S.
credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Sometimes the issue of reduced U.S.
credibility is real, as it is in Asia, where the power of the U.S. is
declining (compared to China and Japan), and where the United States'
inconsistent approach to the North Korea issue is producing unease, not
a tactically useful level of unpredictability. Sometimes, however,
credibility is simply a scapegoat for a policy disagreement or divergent
strategic interests. Either way, the issue is not so much that the U.S.
broke this or that agreement as it is a much broader lack of strategic
clarity dating back to 1991 about how and to what end the U.S. wields
its power in the world.

\]

U.S. President Donald [[Trump\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} abrupt
[[announcement]{.underline}]{.mark} this week [[that he intends to
withdraw]{.underline}]{.mark} all [American troops [out of Syria **risks
dealing a**]{.mark}]{.underline} serious [**[blow to his country\'s
credibility]{.mark}** as an ally and partner]{.underline}, former
national security officials and regional experts warned.

That decision, announced in a Twitter post, was reportedly the
\"breaking point\" for Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who submitted
his resignation letter a day later. The 68-year-old retired Marine Corps
general said he was leaving the administration in part because he does
not agree with Trump on a number of issues, and cited the importance of
alliances.

Geopolitical experts are also sounding the alarm on the state of
America\'s international partnerships.

\"([[Trump\'s]{.mark} Syria [move]{.mark}]{.underline}) [[risks **not
only jeopardizing**]{.mark} **the [near-term U.S. interest]{.mark} of
stabilizing** a key part of the Middle East, [but also]{.mark}
**damaging [America\'s reputation for the long
term]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Turkey expert Soner Cagaptay and former
Defense Department and Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Dana
Stroul wrote in a brief for The Washington Institute for Near East
Policy.

Trump has long opposed U.S. military involvement in Syria, and his
backers view the withdrawal decision as a campaign promise kept. He
announced the defeat the Islamic State (IS), arguing that America should
no longer fight others\' battles for them.

But defense officials and lawmakers reject the assertion that IS is
finished, and say that America still has commitments to allies on the
ground and a reputation to uphold.

\"[[Next time the U.S. needs to challenge]{.mark} an imminent
[terror]{.mark} threat]{.underline} somewhere in the world,
[[we\'ll]{.mark}]{.underline} presumably [[want to do so
\'by]{.underline}]{.mark}, with & through,\' [[using local
partners]{.underline}]{.mark},\" wrote Charles Lister, senior fellow at
the Middle East Institute and author of \"The Syrian Jihad.\"

\"[[**You think they\'re going to trust us now?** **Not a
chance**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

The Kurdish alliance

[[That sentiment was]{.underline}]{.mark} keenly [[felt in **Northern
Syria**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [where America\'s]{.underline} local
[partners]{.underline} in the fight against IS [have expressed concern
they\'re being abandoned]{.underline}.

The U.S. drew up the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), comprised of Arab
and Kurdish fighters, as a local partner on the ground after IS swept
half of Syria in 2014. Military officials describe the Kurdish element
of that coalition --- known as the Kurdish People\'s Protection Unit, or
the YPG --- as by far the most effective fighting force within the
group.

The Kurdish fighters receive U.S. training, weapons and air support, but
some members of the group have been accused of human rights violations,
including ethnic cleansing and the torture of Kurdish, Arab and Turkmen
communities. Counter terrorism partnerships in the Middle East have long
been messy and complex affairs for Washington.

That partnership has long drawn fierce opposition from coalition ally
Turkey, which sees the Kurdish militia as tied to the Kurdistan
Workers\' Party, a U.S.-designated terrorist group that\'s waged a
decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state.

Turkey has publicly threatened an imminent attack on Kurdish-held
territory in northern Syria, and Trump reportedly told the country\'s
leader that Ankara could do as it pleases.

The Kurds now warn a fight with Turkey will detract from their ability
to contain the remaining IS forces.

\"A Turkish incursion would force many YPG fighters to shift their
efforts away from fighting IS, risking a reversal of recent progress,\"
Stroul and Cagaptay wrote.

\"The war against terrorism has not ended and (the Islamic State group)
has not been defeated,\" an SDF representative said in a statement.
\"[[The decision to pull out]{.mark} under these circumstances [will
lead to a **state of instability**]{.mark} and create [a **political and
military void**]{.mark} in the region [and **leave its people between
the claws of enemy forces.**]{.mark}]{.underline}\"

Multiple media reports quoted Kurdish leaders and activists labeling
Trump\'s move a \"betrayal,\" pointing to the thousands of Kurdish
fighters killed in the anti-IS fight.

**[[The shift is catching attention throughout the Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

\"[[This sudden change]{.underline}]{.mark} in policy [[is
worrying]{.underline}]{.mark} \... [[to **all**]{.mark} **U.S.
[allies]{.mark}** [in the region]{.mark}]{.underline},\" former Iraqi
foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari told the Washington Post. \"It\'s a
question of trust. This will cause many governments to rethink their
alliances with a superpower that can throw them under the bus.\"

The shock has rippled to some American forces, where reports from NBC
describe \"U.S. special forces troops distraught, upset, morally
disturbed by having to tell their Kurdish allies in Syria that, because
of orders, their promises of defense won\'t be kept.\"

The Pentagon, White House and State Department did not respond to CNBC
requests for comment.

In a Saturday night Twitter post, Trump said allies \"are very
important-but not when they take advantage of U.S.\"

\]

WASHINGTON --- To President Trump, the question of culpability in the
explosions that crippled two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman is no
question at all. "It's probably got essentially Iran written all over
it," he declared on Friday.

[The question is whether the writing is clear to everyone
else]{.underline}. [For any president, accusing another country of an
act of war presents an enormous challenge]{.underline} to overcome
skepticism at home and abroad. But [[for a president known for
falsehood]{.underline}]{.mark}s and crisis-churning bombast, [the test
of **[credibility appears]{.mark} far more
[daunting]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For two and a half years in office, Mr. [[Trump has spun out so many
**misleading or untrue statements**]{.mark} about himself, his enemies,
his policies, his politics, his family, his personal story, his finances
and his interactions with staff that even his own former communications
director once said "he's a liar" and many Americans long ago concluded
that he cannot be trusted]{.underline}.

[[Fact-checking]{.mark} Mr. [Trump is a **full-time occupation**]{.mark}
in Washington]{.underline}, and in no other circumstance is faith in a
president's word as vital as in matters of war and peace. The public
grew cynical about presidents and intelligence after George W. Bush's
invasion of Iraq based on false accusations of weapons of mass
destruction, and the doubt spilled over to Barack Obama when he accused
Syria of gassing its own people. As Mr. Trump confronts Iran, he carries
the burden of their history and his own.

"The problem is twofold for them," said John E. McLaughlin, a deputy
C.I.A. director during the Iraq war. "One is people will always rightly
question intelligence because it's not an exact science. But the most
important problem for them is their own credibility and contradictions."

The task is all the more formidable for Mr. Trump, who himself has
assailed the reliability of America's intelligence agencies and even the
intelligence chiefs he appointed, suggesting they could not be believed
when their conclusions have not fit his worldview.

At one point shortly before taking the oath of office, he compared
intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany and ever since has cast doubt on
their findings about Russia's interference in the 2016 election. This
year, he repudiated his intelligence chiefs for their assessments of
issues like Iran, declaring that "they are wrong" and "should go back to
school." And just this week, he rebuked the C.I.A. for using a brother
of North Korea's Kim Jong-un as an informant, saying, "I wouldn't let
that happen under my auspices."

All of that can raise questions when international tension flares up,
like the explosion of the two oil tankers on Thursday, a provocation
that fueled anxiety about the world's most important oil shipping route
and the prospect of escalation into military conflict. [[When]{.mark}
Mr. [Trump told Fox News]{.mark} on Friday that "[Iran did do
it]{.mark}," he was [asking his country to accept his
word]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[Trump's [credibility is about **as solid as a** **snake oil
salesman**]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Jen Psaki, who was the White
House communications director and top State Department spokeswoman under
Mr. Obama. "That may work for selling his particular brand to his
political base, but during serious times, [it leaves him without a
wealth of good will and trust from the public that what he is saying is
true even on an issue as serious as Iran's complicity in the tanker
explosions]{.underline}."

White House officials declined to discuss the president's credibility on
the record on Friday, but a senior administration official who asked not
to be identified said Mr. Trump was not hyping a threat to justify a
war. If anything, Mr. Trump has made clear since becoming a presidential
candidate that he did not favor the sort of military interventionism
that characterized Mr. Bush's presidency and, to a lesser extent, even
Mr. Obama's at times.

Indeed, in his telephone interview on Friday with Fox News, Mr. Trump
offered a measured response, avoiding any kinds of threats or discussion
of military action. While he condemned the Iranians, he has pointedly
not publicly floated the possibility of retaliation, and, in fact, he
once again said he was open to talks with Tehran. "I'm ready when they
are," he said.

Still, Mr. Trump's strained relationship with the truth has been a
defining feature of his presidency. [[As of June 7]{.mark}, The
Washington Post's fact-checker had counted **[10,796 false or misleading
claims]{.mark} since he took office**]{.underline}.

The president dismisses that as so much "fake news" by journalists who
are "enemies of the people." Just this week, he told George
Stephanopoulos of ABC News that he was the truthteller, not reporters.
"I like the truth," Mr. Trump said. "You know, I'm actually a very
honest guy."

But it has taken a toll on his credibility with the public. A Quinnipiac
University poll last month found that [only 35 percent of Americans
trust Mr. Trump to tell the truth about important issues versus 52
percent who trusted the news media more]{.underline}.

When it came to this week's oil tanker explosions, Mr. Trump at first
left it to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to point the finger at Iran
and he followed up a day later. To bolster the case, the United States
military released video footage that American officers said showed an
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps patrol boat pulling alongside one of
the stricken ships several hours after the first explosion and removing
an unexploded limpet mine in broad daylight. That mine is what Mr. Trump
said had "Iran written all over it."

Iran has denied responsibility and suggested that the episode was a
"false flag" operation by the United States to frame it and justify
aggression. But Iran has its own credibility issues, and even Mr.
Trump's critics were generally not rushing to accept Tehran's word.

"Look, it could very well have been the Iranians," said Trita Parsi, a
scholar at Georgetown University and the founder of the National Iranian
American Council. "I don't think anyone can say they're innocent."

But Mr. [Trump's "relationship with the truth" is so
suspect]{.underline}, he said, [it argues for stepping back and not
drawing conclusions until there is more evidence]{.underline}. "With
this president, with the country already so divided, even those who
support him may not be totally confident that everything he's saying is
truthful," said Mr. Parsi, the author of "Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran
and the Triumph of Diplomacy."

[[Even supporters]{.mark} of]{.underline} Mr. [Trump]{.underline}'s
tougher approach to Iran [[acknowledge the credibility
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mark Wallace, the executive director of
United Against Nuclear Iran and a strong critic of Mr. Obama's nuclear
agreement with Iran that Mr. Trump has since renounced, said the
government needs to rely on its career professionals to inform the
public about Tehran's activities.

compromised leader,\" Guardian, accessed 7-22-2019,

Earlier this week Donald Trump stood on the south lawn of the White
House and ridiculed Theresa May's Brexit agreement as a "great deal for
the EU". He is likely to make the same contemptuous case during the G20
summit in Argentina this weekend, although pointedly there is no planned
bilateral. Given the political stakes facing her back home, Mrs May must
feel as if 14,000 miles is a long way to travel for the weekend merely
to be trashed by supposedly her greatest ally.

When this happens, though, who does Mrs May imagine is confronting her?
[[Is it just]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
himself, America [First president]{.underline}, [[sworn enemy of the
international order]{.mark} in general and the European Union in
particular]{.underline}? That's a bad enough reality. But
[[might]{.underline}]{.mark} her accuser **[[also
be]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at some level, Vladimir [**[Putin]{.mark}**,
a leader whose interest in weakening the EU and breaking Britain from it
as damagingly as possible outdoes even that of]{.underline} Mr
[Trump]{.underline}? That prospect is even worse.

Such speculation would normally seem, and still probably is, a step too
far. The idea that a US president is in any way doing the Kremlin's
business as well as his own is the stuff of spy thrillers and of John le
Carré TV adaptations. Yet the icy fact is that the conspiracy theory may
now also contain an element of truth.

On Thursday, Mr Trump's longtime lawyer, Michael
[[Cohen]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[pleaded guilty]{.underline}]{.mark} --
in a court filing by the special counsel Robert Mueller -- [[to lying
to]{.mark} the]{.underline} US [[congress about]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr
[[Trump's Russian interests and connections]{.mark}]{.underline} during
the months when the New York property magnate was running for the
Republican presidential nomination in 2016. It was not true, Mr Cohen
has now admitted, that the Trump organisation ended its interest in
Russian deals in January 2016; not true that there were no plans for
Russian visits by Mr Trump later in 2016 to make property deals; not
true that the Russian government did not respond to the deal overtures.
Indeed, as late as May 2016, Mr [Cohen was in indirect contact
with]{.underline} Mr [Putin]{.underline}'s office about the possibility
of a meeting with Mr Trump in St Petersburg in June.

Days before he took office in 2017, Mr [Trump said that "the closest I
came to Russia" was in selling a Florida property to a Russian oligarch
in 2008]{.underline}. If Mr Cohen's statement is true, Mr Trump was
telling his country a lie. What is more, the Russians knew it.
Potentially, that raises issues of US national security. If Mr Putin
knew that Mr Trump was concealing information about his Russian business
interests, this could give Moscow leverage over the US leader. Mr Trump
might feel constrained to praise Mr Putin or to avoid conflicts with
Russia over policy.

All this may indeed be very far-fetched. Yet [[Russia's
activities]{.underline}]{.mark} in the 2016 election [[against
Hillary]{.underline}]{.mark} Clinton [[and in favour
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr [[Trump **are not
fiction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They [[prompted the setting up of the
Mueller inquiry]{.mark} into links between the Russian government and
the Trump campaign]{.underline}. Another document this week suggests a
longtime Trump adviser, [Roger [Stone, may have sought]{.mark}
information about [WikiLeaks plans to release hacked Dem]{.mark}ocratic
party [emails]{.mark} in 2016.]{.underline}

There is nothing in the documents released this week that proves that Mr
Trump conspired with Russian efforts to win him the presidency. Yet
those efforts were real. For two years, Mr [Trump has gone to
unprecedented lengths to attack the special counsel. After]{.underline}
November's [midterms, he seemed on the verge of firing]{.underline} Mr
[Mueller]{.underline}. He may yet do so. But this week's charges suggest
that there is plenty more still to be revealed. Mr Trump still has
questions to answer from the investigating authorities, from the new
Congress -- and from America's long-suffering allies.

### 2NC -- Iran Deal

#### Re-entry to the JCPOA solves more than just legitimacy

*\*JCPOA = [J]{.underline}oint [C]{.underline}omprehensive
[P]{.underline}lan [o]{.underline}f [A]{.underline}ction, the Iran
nuclear deal*

REPAIRING THE DAMAGE: THE U.S. RETURN TO THE JCPOA

The incoming [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and a successor
administration [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} respectively [halt and
[repair]{.mark}]{.underline} much of the [[damage]{.mark} from Trump's
JCPOA exit [by signaling]{.mark} the [political will and intent]{.mark}
for the U.S. [to re-enter the JCPOA]{.mark}'s fold [and resume
obligations]{.mark}]{.underline} thereto, including via the lifting of
nuclear-related sanctions.

**[[Resuming commitments]{.mark} under the JCPOA would deliver profound
benefits for the U.S. national interest]{.underline}**. First, [it
[would **signal to the world**]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[the U.S. is
a responsible actor]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the international arena;
[the U.S. **[intends to live up to]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[political agreements]{.underline}]{.mark}** that it makes [with
other countries]{.underline}; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}
nothing more than [[an unfortunate aberration]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the American political system. [Nothing has caused more serious
damage]{.underline} to U.S. interests [than]{.underline} the [growing
trust deficit]{.underline} towards the United States. If states are
unable to trust the United States, then not only is U.S. global
leadership severely undermined but the international system that has
been predominate since the end of the Second World War risks unraveling.
[By]{.underline} clearly [showing the world]{.underline} that [the U.S.
intends to fully observe]{.underline} the [commitments]{.underline} that
it makes, a successor [administration can]{.underline} begin to
[repair]{.underline} the [damage]{.underline} wrought by President
Trump.

Second, the U.S.'s [[re-entrance]{.mark} into the JCPOA]{.underline}
[**[would have]{.mark}**]{.underline} important
**[[non-prolif]{.mark}eration [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}** by
effectively disincentivizing Iran from exiting the JCPOA itself and thus
undoing the risk of a burgeoning nuclear crisis in the Middle East. In
so doing, the U.S. would ensure the survivability of the tough and
far-reaching constraints on Iran's nuclear program that will be imposed
by the JCPOA through 2030 and beyond. Iran's nuclear program does not
pose the risks it did in the pre-2015 era, and that is fully thanks to
the JCPOA and the restrictions it imposes. Any policymaker should be
eager to return to the JCPOA and, in so doing, re-secure hard-fought
concessions that take an Iranian nuclear weapon and war with Iran over
its nuclear program off the table for the foreseeable future.

Third, [reentry]{.underline} to the JCPOA **[[would signal to]{.mark}
the kingdom of [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline}** that Donald
**[Trump's [blank check]{.mark}]{.underline}** for their increasingly
brazen behavior **[[is at an end]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and that the
U.S. has alternatives to outsourcing American policy in the region to an
erratic kingdom that -- in the words of Sen. Lindsey Graham -- has
double dealt on terror. Perversely, both the Trump administration and
numerous Washington pressure groups have warned that the
administration's pressure campaign against Iran would be jeopardized if
the U.S. dared to impose consequences on the kingdom over the brutal
murder of Saudi journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi. Such
warnings expose the current administration's approach to the region as
so hopelessly unbalanced that is susceptible to extortion by one morally
bankrupt regime against another. [[The U.S. needs to move to a]{.mark}
transactional [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} with both Saudi Arabia
and Iran [[where we can impose consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} on each
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} such [brazen
[misbehavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Iran, the U.S. has sanctioned
itself out of influence, whereas with Saudi Arabia the U.S. is too
afraid to use its substantial leverage to rein in the kingdom's
destructive course -- whether on the disastrous war in Yemen or on the
kingdom's mounting human rights abuses. [An alternative is available,
and **it should start with re-entry to the JCPOA.**]{.underline}

Finally, [U.S. participation]{.underline} in the JCPOA Joint Commission
[[**would guarantee diplomacy with Iran** that does not]{.mark}
presently [exist]{.mark}]{.underline} amid the administration's pressure
campaign, [[and could lead to]{.mark} follow-on [negotiations
addressing]{.mark}]{.underline} the full spectrum of [[America's
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} with Iran -- [including regional security
and human rights]{.underline}. The present Trump administration approach
of exiting the JCPOA and seeking its destruction prohibits the U.S. from
affecting Iran's calculations on issues beyond the nuclear file. Any
policymaker with justifiable concerns with Iranian behavior or who seeks
political solutions to the proxy conflicts that have gripped the region
should be urging a return to the JCPOA.

[[Returning]{.mark} to the JCPOA]{.underline} and restoring U.S.
credibility and influence with Iran [[is unlikely to be without cost,
but]{.mark} will [not]{.mark} be]{.underline} nearly [[as costly as the
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. reneged on its commitments
and, barring Congressional intervention or a change of heart from
President Trump himself, will have materially breached the accord by
snapping back nuclear-related sanctions for a period of at least 32
months if there is a change in administration after the 2020 elections.
Judging by recent sanctions designations, as well, the Trump
administration does not appear intent to sit idly in the months ahead,
but will proceed with a dramatic expansion of sanctions designations
that may go well beyond previous sanctions campaigns. These will have a
tremendous negative effect on the Iranian economy and the Iranian
people's aspirations, in addition to the economies of our allies in
Europe seeking to comply with the UNSC-endorsed JCPOA.

### 2NC -- North Korea

#### Embracing North Korea solves legitimacy -- perception matters more than material action

\]

If history is to remember one of the most audacious photo ops in
American diplomacy as anything more than a stunt, the President must now
produce breakthroughs from his friendship with the brutal dictator Kim
Jong Un.

Yet even if that progress is slow to emerge, [[Trump can]{.mark} still
[chalk up a]{.mark} valuable [political win]{.mark} that will underscore
how his foreign policy is]{.underline} often [directed by his electoral
priorities]{.underline}.

[[He can use his]{.underline}]{.mark} singular [[televised moment to
bolster]{.mark}]{.underline} his [[claims to be a statesman and a
peacemaker]{.underline}]{.mark}. And it\'s not just about winning the
Nobel Prize that the President believes he deserves for forging an
opening with one of the most despotic regimes in modern history.

Trump also has a vital political interest in keeping alive the idea that
he personally headed off war with North Korea and that historic progress
is possible as he runs for reelection.

His meeting with Kim is a centerpiece of the \"peace and prosperity\"
platform on which he plans to anchor his bid for a second term and to
use to rise above his Democratic rivals.

[[Trump will be praised by]{.mark} conservative [media and **the reality
of US-No**]{.mark}**rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [relations will be glossed
over]{.mark}**]{.underline}, all in the service of his 2020 campaign.

The political significance of Sunday\'s eye-popping encounter was
revealed in the quick condemnations offered by Democratic presidential
candidates seeking to deny him a political win.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted that Trump shouldn\'t be
\"squandering American influence on photo ops and exchanging love
letters with a ruthless dictator.\"

But [[politics is often shaped more by perception than
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[the]{.mark} North Korean [summit is
an example of how Trump can use]{.mark} the office of the [presidency to
his own benefit]{.mark}]{.underline} ahead of 2020.

And Trump, by becoming the first sitting President to step into North
Korea, also outdid his predecessors, some of whom simply climbed atop
the border wall and peered over the other side into the isolated state.

#### Withdrawal from Syria decks legitimacy -- staying solves

\]

On Wednesday, President [[Trump announced he wants to pull]{.mark}
troops [out of Syria]{.mark}]{.underline} because the United States
military had achieved its goal of defeating the Islamic State militant
group there. In this Q&A, terrorism expert Martha Crenshaw addresses the
president's decision.

Has the U.S. defeated the Islamic State in Syria? What does "defeat"
mean in this context?

U.S. leaders have talked optimistically about "defeating" first Al Qaeda
and then the Islamic State since the declaration of a global war on
terror in 2001. [[If it were possible to vanquish]{.mark} such an
adversary]{.underline} on the battlefield through the application of
superior military force, [[we would already have accomplished the
mission]{.underline}.]{.mark} The Islamic State combines insurgency with
transnational terrorism, and its operations flow easily across national
borders. Since its beginnings in 2003, it has demonstrated a capacity
for resilience and reconstitution --- and for surprising us. The loss of
the Caliphate has not changed this equation.

What regional impacts might this decision have?

[[The Iraqi government has not shown itself capable of providing]{.mark}
the [security or legitimacy that might undermine the appeal of the
Is]{.mark}lam[i]{.mark}c [S]{.mark}tate]{.underline}.
[Despite]{.underline} \[Syrian President\] [Assad's ruthless
consolidation of power]{.underline} with the aid of Iran and Russia,
[opposition to his regime will continue]{.underline}.
[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} the [American-supported [Kurdish resistance is
abandoned]{.mark}]{.underline} by the U.S. and then destroyed or
weakened by Turkey, [[there will be]{.mark} even [more scope and
rationale for jihadists]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the Islamic State.
Also, [[we shouldn't forget]{.mark} that the [Al Qaeda]{.mark} branch in
Syria [is still active]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What about in terms of the U.S. relationship with Russia and Iran versus
with allies in the region?

It seems that [[the assumption behind the withdrawal
is]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the U.S. is willing to leave
Syria]{.mark}n affairs [to Russia and Iran]{.mark} [and]{.mark} to
[allow Turkey to pursue an offensive against]{.mark} our [Kurdish
allies]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[We should probably call them "former
allies" now]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Turkey is likely to draw closer to
Iran and Russia.

Some American military leaders have spoken up against this decision,
calling it wrongheaded. Does that matter?

Probably not to the President's decisions, but vocal military opposition
would matter to Congress and other opinion leaders.

[As U.S. troops withdraw from Syria]{.underline}, [[another country
**may be stepping up its presence**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the war torn
nation[: [China]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Beijing sees the situation]{.mark} in Syria [as an opportunity to
benefit economically]{.mark}, [expand]{.mark} its [influence in the
Middle East and]{.mark} even [boost]{.mark} its globe-spanning [Belt and
Road]{.mark} infrastructure investment initiative]{.underline}.

"As the U.S. is withdrawing its troops, the [[EU and U.S. have shown
little interest in supporting Assad]{.mark} and]{.underline} leading the
[efforts of reconstructing Syria]{.underline}. [[China is facing
**little competition**]{.mark} in Syria to realize its
plans]{.underline}, " said Mollie Saltskog, an analyst at security
intelligence firm The Soufan Group.

U.S. President Donald [Trump abruptly ordered the withdrawal of 2,000
U.S. troops from Syria last December, saying the extremist group Islamic
State had been defeated]{.underline} --- the "only reason" he's wanted
troops in the country. As the American forces withdraw, the spotlight
has turned to the other nations with strategic interests in Syria's
ongoing civil war.

While experts and lawmakers suggest the U.S. drawdown may strengthen the
hands of Russia and Iran, Syrian President Bashar Assad's partners,
others have highlighted China's potential role in coming years.

That is, with diminishing U.S. influence in the region, China is
presented with an opportunity to increase its economic presence in
Syria, Saltskog said.

A \$250 billion investment opportunity

According to UN estimates, rebuilding Syria from its years of civil war
will reportedly cost about \$250 billion.

[[As Assad]{.underline}]{.mark}'s administration [[faces growing
economic pressure from]{.mark} U.S. [sanctions and the war]{.mark}, [it
is likely to look for]{.mark}]{.underline} even [more [support]{.mark}
--- and [China is poised to lend a hand]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The world's second-largest economy is]{.underline} already [vying to
take the lead in post-war reconstruction even before the conflict has
ended]{.underline}. At the 2017 Trade Fair on Syrian Reconstruction
Projects in Beijing, [the nation pledged \$2 billion to establish an
industrial park in Syria.]{.underline}

Chinese auto companies Geely and Changan have reportedly partnered with
Syrian car manufacturer Mallouk & Co, and its manufacturing plant in
Homs is set to produce both brands of cars.

"[[It serves (China's) interest to]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[enter
Syria economically]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and be seen as contributing to
the overall economy]{.underline}, " said Bonnie Glaser, a senior Asia
advisor at a Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and
International Studies.

"[[This can create greater]{.underline}]{.mark}, sort of **[more
[positive sentiments]{.mark} and attitudes [toward
China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ultimately, that could translate to more
Chinese influence in the region," she added.

On top of that, [Beijing is likely to leverage a role in Syria's
reconstruction]{.underline} to advance its Belt and Road Initiative,
Saltskog said.

### 2NC -- Trump

#### The Trump administration lacks credibility

Paul Waldman 1/8 \[Paul Waldman, opinion writer covering politics,
01-08-2019, \"Opinion,\" Washington Post, accessed 7-22-2019,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/01/08/no-one-trump-administration-has-any-credibility-left/?utm_term=.becdd3b7f8bf
\]

Something curious is happening right now: [[The
president]{.underline}]{.mark} of the United States [[is]{.mark} [giving
a]{.mark} prime-time [address]{.mark} on an urgent political
controversy, [and]{.mark} pretty much **[everyone acknowledges]{.mark}**
that in that address **[he is going to lie]{.mark}** to the American
people.]{.underline}

The TV networks, which often have aired such speeches when the president
asks, are struggling to figure out how to handle it; they seem to have
decided that allowing a Democratic response, plus some post-hoc
fact-checking, will fulfill their journalistic responsibilities.

But there's something else going on here, too. [[This administration is
**so morally and intellectually degraded**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[there is **not a single major figure within**]{.mark} it [who retains
credibility]{.mark} with the press or the public]{.underline}. In the
midst of a political crisis, there is no administration official whose
word we can take on anything.

For context, I want to look back on a relevant episode from the recent
past. In 2002 and 2003, George W. Bush's administration was waging one
of the great propaganda efforts in American history to convince the
public that if we didn't invade Iraq, Saddam Hussein would soon attack
us with his fearsome arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. As Vice
President Dick Cheney put it in a speech, "Simply stated, there is no
doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction; there is
no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, against
our allies, and against us."

This was a lie, and though most of the public seemed to be buying it, as
it approached the time when Bush was ready to launch the invasion, the
administration needed a rhetorical coup de grace to make the momentum
for war unstoppable. So they turned to Secretary of State Colin Powell,
a former general who was not only known to be harboring some skepticism
about the case for invading, but who was held in such high esteem by
both the news media and the public that not only would he be given the
benefit of the doubt, but just about anything he said would be assumed
to be unimpeachable.

Powell gave a speech to the United Nations in February 2003, laying out
the administration's case for war --- a speech that we would later learn
was as full of falsehoods, distortions, and tendentious claims as
everything else coming out of the administration at the time. But the
reception to the speech, just as the administration hoped, was
positively rapturous. Such was Powell's reputation that if he said it,
nearly the entire news media concluded, it had to be true.

The point of this story is that Powell\'s credibility was a potent
resource on which the administration could draw. It happened that they
drew on it in service to propagating lies to enable a catastrophic war,
but in theory they could have drawn on it to justify something
worthwhile.

But try to imagine something like that happening today. [Which of
President Trump's senior aides would be able to come before the public
and say, "These are the facts, and this is what we must do about them,"
**and be taken seriously?**]{.underline}

Indeed, these days [[when]{.mark} administration [officials do
interviews]{.mark}, [they\'re forced to spend]{.mark} much of their
[time defending]{.mark} the [lies their boss has told]{.mark} on the
issue at hand]{.underline}. That\'s what happened when Vice President
Pence did a round of interviews to make the case that we\'re facing a
\"crisis\" on the border that justifies a government shutdown and the
declaration of a national emergency that would allow President Trump to
exercise powers not ordinarily available to the president. Pence\'s
ability to spin was put to the test, with sad results, as he was
questioned about Trump\'s lie that previous presidents told him they
wished they had built a wall on the southern border, and the lie the
entire administration is telling that thousands of suspected terrorists
have been apprehended trying to come in from Mexico.

[The vice president isn\'t going to convince anyone]{.underline} who
isn\'t already in Trump\'s camp of [what the administration would like
the country to believe]{.underline}. The president\'s press secretary
may be the most shamelessly dishonest person ever to occupy that post,
which is saying something. The secretary of homeland security is a joke.
The acting attorney general is a widely viewed as a contemptible
sycophant grossly unqualified for his position. And the person with the
highest reputation among Trump officials, former secretary of defense
James Mattis, just quit in disgust.

That isn't to say that Trump doesn't have a few people in his
administration who have managed to hold on to their reputations. But
they have done so only by being invisible. It isn't as though the
administration is going to say, "The American people must know why the
flow of asylum seekers at the border is such an urgent crisis. Here to
make that case\...Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao!"

[[With no one else able to convince]{.mark} the public, [Trump
himself]{.mark} --- [the one with the least credibility]{.mark} of all
--- [is set to step up]{.mark} to do the job himself. [And he will
fail]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\]

[[Less than a year and a half in]{.mark}to his term]{.underline},
President Donald [[Trump has done **more damage to** U.S.
fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy **[cred]{.mark}ibility
[than]{.mark}**]{.underline} even [the right-wing bogeyman version of
**[Obama]{.mark} managed to** do **[in eight]{.mark}
years**]{.underline}. Yet, strangely, few of these credibility hawks
seem particularly perturbed by his choices. Of course, Trump is guilty
of some of the exact same sins they pin on Obama, particularly in Syria,
where the U.S. is still failing to hold Assad accountable for his
continued brutality. Yet, [[he is also]{.mark} undermining our
credibility in another]{.underline}, equally important [way: by
**[diluting our allies' confidence]{.mark}** that the U.S. can be relied
on to uphold its commitments]{.underline}.

Take for example [his abrupt decision]{.underline} on Thursday [to
cancel a]{.underline} planned [summit with]{.underline} North Korean
dictator [Kim Jong-un over]{.underline} his country's [nuclear weapons
program]{.underline}. The summit was the product of Trump's own
misunderstanding and rash decision-making in the first place, and not in
any way coordinated with our allies or other key players in East Asia
(i.e., China).

[Trump's letter to Kim announcing the cancellation was likewise
uncoordinated]{.underline} and came as a surprise to Seoul, Tokyo,
Beijing, and even Foggy Bottom, from which Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo had been touting the diplomatic progress the administration was
making a mere hour before the letter was published. (Welcome to the
Trump State Department, Mike. It isn't going to be any better for you
than it was for Rex Tillerson.)

Right-wing pundits were quick to spin the letter as an example of
Trump's muscular, dominating, alpha-male approach to negotiation.
Trump's (ghostwritten) book, The Art of the Deal, was referenced
repeatedly. Forget that namby-pamby consensus-building crap that comrade
Obama trafficked in; this is how Real Men do diplomacy. North Korea
responded respectfully to the letter, saying it was still interested in
talking to the U.S., and now the summit may or may not be back in the
cards. (Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a
surprise meeting on Saturday, as well.)

See, say the right-wing pundits: Trump's abusive style of negotiating
works. Don't believe the nattering naysayers of the liberal media.

Aside from the facts that the summit could still get canceled again or
end in failure, that North Korea might still be playing a long game to
embarrass the U.S., and that Trump probably could have achieved this
turnaround without making such a dramatic gesture, there's a glaring
problem with this line of argument. [In business]{.underline}, sure,
[suddenly pulling out of a deal in order to scare your counterparty into
meeting your terms can work, sometimes]{.underline}.

[Imagine]{.underline}, however, [how you might feel if your business
partner in a joint venture pulled such a stunt without asking, or even
so much as warning, you about it. [Would you ever trust or work with
that partner again]{.mark}? [That's]{.mark} precisely [what Trump
did]{.mark} on Thursday]{.underline} to Moon, with whom he had met just
two days before in Washington.

The South Korean government was blindsided by the announcement that the
summit was canceled, and none too pleased to be treated this way by its
ally. Trump's hardball tactics have undercut Moon's efforts at
reconciliation, whereas what little enthusiasm China had for
participating in sanctions against North Korea has waned. If Trump's
strategy is to pressure Kim into making a deal, he has done a fine job
of alienating the regional partners he will need to apply that pressure
effectively.

In the right-wing critique of Obama's foreign policy, U.S. credibility
is defined rather one-dimensionally, as the willingness to follow
through on threats and to back up our words with hard power. But
[**[credibility also means keeping]{.mark} your [promises]{.mark}**,
especially to friends and partners, which the Trump administration
appears unwilling or unable to do. Is the U.S. actually committed to
resolving]{.underline} the Korean situation [diplomatically or not?
Right now, nobody in Seoul can really say for sure --- and that's a big
problem]{.underline}, because they're the ones who will suffer and die
if the crisis spirals into war.

[[Trump has **treated our allies no better**]{.underline}]{.mark} when
it comes to the other item on his foreign policy agenda this year: Iran.
The president [**withdrew** the U.S. **from the deal to contain Iran**'s
nuclear program]{.underline} --- effectively ensuring its demise ---
**[over the objections of every other country involved]{.underline}** in
making it, including key American allies in Europe along with Russia and
China. That he did so at the urging of Iran's enemies Israel and Saudi
Arabia does not inspire confidence in foreign capitals that the U.S. is
committed to avoiding yet another catastrophic war in the Middle East.

[Trump's threats to U.S. credibility also include his unilateral
**[withdrawal from]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark} climate agreement** and
his **[reluctant commitment to NATO]{.mark}'s common
defense**]{.underline}. Needless to say, the increasingly visible web of
personal and money connections between Trump and the Russian plutocracy
also diminishes American credibility in obvious ways, as even the
suspicion that the U.S. president might have unsavory ties to Moscow
could lead other world leaders to second-guess his decisions.

But to the right, none of this matters. To them, credibility means we do
what we threaten to do and nothing more, keeping our promises to allied
countries only as those allies pay up or kowtow. This is in keeping with
the contempt for internationalism that forms a core principle of Trump's
self-centered, jingoistic ideology, which the GOP has with few
exceptions wholeheartedly embraced. It is certainly what you'd expect in
a foreign policy directed primarily by National Security Adviser John
Bolton, who despises the United Nations, has no interest in what the
rest of the world thinks, and openly favors military "solutions" in both
Iran and North Korea.

[[For decades, the]{.mark} free [world has operated under the
assumption]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[will]{.mark} act as its [lead]{.mark}er, using its might to advance not
only its own interests but also those of its kindred nations and the
international community writ large. [Under Trump]{.mark}, the world is
finding that **[we can no longer be trusted]{.mark}** to engage in
consultation, deliberation, or dialogue of any kind. Instead, we do
whatever we want]{.underline} (or whatever he wants) [with no real
concern for the impact our decisions have on other countries, be they
allies or adversaries]{.underline}.

When other countries behave this way, we have a word for it: We call
them rogue states. How long will our allies put up with this behavior
before they simply stop believing a word we say? And how long will it
take to repair that damage after the Trump era is over?

#### Trump is the root cause of many foreign policy issues

\]

[[The executive]{.mark} branch [is making]{.mark} a lot of [people
nervous lately]{.mark}]{.underline}. On April 13, President Trump
ordered [[**missile** **strikes in Syria**]{.mark} **without
congressional authorization**]{.underline}. He's reputedly looking into
the [**[finances of the US]{.mark} [P]{.mark}ostal [S]{.mark}ervice**
because of its deal with Amazon]{.underline}, a company Trump has
attacked on Twitter a bunch of times. A few weeks ago, he dismissed FBI
Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Rumors are circulating that Deputy
Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be fired soon (or perhaps special
counsel Robert Mueller himself). Rex Tillerson was dismissed as
secretary of state last month, and possibly notified of it by Twitter
(or worse). [There have probably been a few
**[scandals]{.mark}**]{.underline} while I was writing this.

Among some analysts, it's been a popular move to suggest that [Trump
fits into a group of world leaders who have]{.underline} recently [risen
to power on promises to curb the power of elites and their pesky
institutions]{.underline}. The impact of these populist leaders in
Eastern European democracies has included the curbing of press freedom
and formal constitutional changes that strip courts of their powers. In
Western Europe, right-wing populist movements have stoked nationalist
sentiment in order to undermine institutions; the unexpected Brexit vote
in 2016 is an example of this.

Despite this context and the apparent strongman tactics in the White
House, [[the]{.mark} brewing [crisis in the US is one of
legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than power. This isn't to say
that Trump hasn't used presidential power in highly unorthodox and
problematic ways --- the language that comes out of the White House
reflects a profound lack of understanding of constitutional government.
It's pretty standard for presidents to be more responsive to their
supporters and to the needs of politically pivotal groups (see, for
example, The Particularistic President, which illustrates this
phenomenon looking at a wide range of data). But [[Trump has been more
transparent about]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[aims, with actions and
language that suggest he means to punish]{.mark} political
[opponents]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Speaking of transparency, the executive branch has taken some steps to
limit public access to records and information. It's sometimes lost in
the "cover-up was worse than the crime" narrative, but when the House
Judiciary Committee brought up articles of impeachment for Richard
Nixon, one of them focused heavily on his use of state power to track
and punish his political opponents. The heart of abuse of power isn't
that the president has expanded the power of the executive branch; it's
that he's used his position atop the branch that carries out laws for
reasons that are unacceptable in a liberal democracy.

When we look at presidential history, though, we see many broad and
dramatic expansions of executive power. Barack Obama's actions in Libya
were widely criticized as unconstitutional, as were some of his
unilateral actions on other policy issues. George W. Bush and his staff
invoked an entire theory of presidential power to justify their actions
in the war on terror. The way Harry Truman entered the Korean War
expanded presidential war powers, a trend continued by nearly all of his
successors in some way.

Numerous presidents --- ones who frequently top the rankings --- broke
into areas of domestic policy where presidents hadn't gone before.
Andrew Jackson's use of the veto as a policy instrument, Theodore
Roosevelt's involvement in mediating the 1902 coal strike, Woodrow
Wilson's hands-on approach to legislation, and basically FDR's entire
domestic presidency were all examples of expanding presidential
authority on the grounds that it was necessary to ensure the health of
the country in some way. And all drew criticism for those expansions and
for their policy positions.

But in the long run, [presidents are often rewarded for]{.underline}
these kinds of [institutional boundary violations]{.underline}. In other
words, presidential power expands in ways that are often useful but
unchecked to varying degrees.

Trump hasn't offered a new constitutional doctrine or argued for
stretching the "take care" clause. [He has used regulatory power to
alter policy, including trying to kill the Affordable Care Act and
severely curtail environmental protections]{.underline}.

Making policy --- especially consequential and controversial policy ---
out of the executive branch is not ideal, nor is it new. The idea that
the president could be a more responsive than the constitutional system,
with its veto points and its parochial Congress, is what informed the
whole idea of the progressive presidency.

Under different conditions, too much policymaking in the executive
branch alongside a gridlocked Congress might be cause for a reckoning
over the lawmaking process. Most analysts agree that congressional
paralysis and dysfunction is behind some of the executive expansion. But
it's not necessarily a crisis, at least not one of the same magnitude
that's happening elsewhere.

Trump has not changed the content of the Constitution. Some have
identified his behavior as a lack of institutional forbearance, or
restraint, in the use of all available capacities. [But what's at the
heart of the brewing crisis is legitimacy: the reasons behind the use of
executive power. In other words, the crisis lies less in the specific
actions than in the fact that they seem to be driven by nepotism,
personal loyalty, and sometimes ethnonationalism.]{.underline}

These are all principles that most Americans don't associate with
democracy, to say the least. Despite Trump's nationalist rhetoric, some
of his most controversial actions have been justified not in terms of
saving the nation, but in terms of avoiding accountability in the
administration.

This kind of legitimacy issue is not entirely new. When presidents have
pushed at the boundaries of their accepted authority, they've needed to
draw on core concepts, like electoral mandates, to reframe what they're
doing. And the Nixon parallels that we keep hearing about have a strong
legitimacy component. Abuse of power is partly about what's being done,
but a great deal of it is about the reasons --- self-serving and
anti-democratic --- behind the actions.

The situation the country finds itself in now inverts the usual question
of presidential power: Do the ends justify the means? Can presidential
action that pushes against. or past, accepted boundaries be justified if
it addresses a pressing problem? Who gets to decide?

Trump is something different. Presidents have plenty of means to achieve
what they want. Trump's predecessors have ensured that. But there are
two distinct debates happening about whether the ends justify the means
with Trump.

One is among Republicans, and it's been going on for some time. A few
elite Republicans were early adopters of the Trump message, though not
very many. A few have consistently been critical of at least some
aspects of the administration, particularly where fundamental rule of
law issues are concerned. And the question for those Republicans remains
as to whether Trump's nonstandard approach to tweeting, accountability,
etc. is worth hanging on to some form of party unity.

For Democrats, many of the ends were never desirable. But that's how it
goes in a democracy --- what you agree on is the process, or at least
the acceptable boundaries. This has obviously broken down under Trump,
but not in a way that is strictly about tweets or administrative
procedure violations. There are questions about the election, of course.
At a deeper level, there are ideas that animated Trump's candidacy ---
about the role and status of immigrants, about "law and order" politics
--- that would never have been seen by some Americans as legitimate. The
most impeccable process would not have changed that.

What does this all mean for the current moment, particularly for Trump's
recent decision to order airstrikes in Syria? Scholars of presidential
power are skeptical of the legality of the action, and the justification
seems to be an even bigger problem. Presidents have been forgiven for a
lot of unilateral action in the name of national security --- which
isn't part of the story here --- as well as humanitarian intervention.
Importantly, public patience is still often limited when these missions
drag on. But [[Trump's actions **alarmed observers**, **even
those**]{.mark} **who were [inclined to support military
action]{.mark}** in Syria, because of their lack of clear doctrine and
justification]{.underline}.

It would be an exaggeration to say that Trump's use of presidential
power has been entirely standard. It has not. But it's also not
responsible for a new doctrine of executive action or new spheres of
presidential involvement. Trump's predecessors, Republican and
Democratic alike, have created an office with expansive power, leaving
the door open for someone like Trump, who is untethered by ideology or
deep affiliations with a party or faction, to make governing decisions
without clear justifications for the electorate to weigh in on.

A crisis of legitimacy means there are real questions about whether
governance is possible. In this case, it's substantially but not
entirely about the person in the White House. There are also questions
about policy differences, identity-based conflicts, and negative
partisanship. Having a president who treats governance and
accountability recklessly may be a symptom of these issues, but it's
also an obstacle to addressing them.

There will be no Mount Rushmore for Donald Trump. But, if there\'s a
presidential library, it should contain a Hall of Tweets, a Hall of
[Lies]{.underline}, a Hall of [Insults]{.underline} and, with the
\"Marines\' Hymn\" softly playing, a Hall of Montezuma, with a section
of his border wall. Finally, [[there should be a Hall of Consequences,
the grandest in the place]{.mark}. No president since Franklin D.
Roosevelt has mattered as much.]{.underline}

[[Trump has remade the Republican Party]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is [no
longer the party of Lincoln or Reagan]{.underline}, but increasingly [a
**snarling, sneering** collection of **score-settlers, white
nationalists, immigrant bashers, homophobes, science-deniers and
religious reactionaries**]{.underline} who praise a president who has
lived a squalid personal life but who promised them a Supreme Court in
their own image. [Trump\'s GOP may not endure, but for the foreseeable
future it reigns supreme.]{.underline}

Trump\'s dominance of his party is personified by Mitch McConnell. The
Senate majority leader\'s first love was once the institution and its
prerogatives. Just last week, however, he endorsed Trump\'s emergency
decree, which rolled right over Congress, usurping its traditional role
in order to fulfill a silly campaign pledge. Trump has personally
berated McConnell, but \-- unburdened by either pride or principle \--
McConnell does what the president wants. He faces re-election next year
in a state, Kentucky, whose heart throbs for Trump. Understandably,
McConnell fears vilification as a moderate.

In foreign affairs, the Trump presidency has had a huge impact. By fiat,
by insult and by a dazzling display of historical ignorance, [Trump has
**[diminished the Atlantic alliance]{.mark}** which every president
since Roosevelt has supported and nourished]{.underline}. [The lessons
of World War II and of the]{.underline} implosion of the [Soviet
communist empire]{.underline} \-- signal achievements of American
involvement and leadership in the affairs of Europe \-- [are being
discarded]{.underline}. At the Munich Security Conference last week,
much of [Europe stood to applaud]{.underline} German Chancellor Angela
[Merkel]{.underline} [but stayed seated for]{.underline} Vice President
Mike [Pence]{.underline}. Merkel reproached Trump\'s foreign policy;
Pence defended it. The symbolism was stark: [[America may not yet be
isolationist, **but it is isolated**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Under Trump, **[[the judiciary is being
transformed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. His [judges not only are bitterly
conservative but]{.underline} have been [deemed unqualified by the
American Bar Association]{.underline} at an unprecedented rate. He has
[vitiated Cabinet and other offices dealing with the environment and
natural resources]{.underline}, turning over the grandeur of America to
despoilers. Only his appointees\' ineptness or sense of grandiosity \--
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\'s \$25,000 phone booth, for instance \--
has slowed the onslaught. Pruitt did manage to get Trump to withdraw
from the Paris climate agreement before he resigned.

It\'s hard to know which of Trump\'s actions have had the greatest
consequence. But maybe the most damaging is how [[he has **soiled the
presidency itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [His incessant
lying]{.underline} \-- The Washington Post counted 8,459 false or
misleading statements as of Feb 3 \-- [has turned the presidency into a
gong show]{.underline}. He sits at the desk of presidents who took the
truth seriously, who may have lied on occasion but never routinely.
[Trump, though, spouts lies like a drunken parrot]{.underline}, with,
approximately, similar plumage. [He has diminished the importance of
truth, **making it indistinguishable from lies**]{.underline} \-- just
more noise.

[Trump\'s [attacks on the press are **vividly
demagogic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [He has weakened its ability to be
believed]{.underline}, to uncover scandal, to hold accountable the
otherwise unaccountable. [He applies the prefix \"fake\" to any news he
does not like]{.underline}. He does not simply disagree. He
de-establishes and then concocts his own version. He has weakened the
FBI, denigrated the CIA, praised Russia\'s Vladimir Putin and shrugged
at the murder of a Post columnist by the Saudis. He is a president out
of Orwell, a creature out of Kafka, a nightmare out of the Electoral
College.

#### Trump is uniquely bad -- no president's legitimacy has stooped this low

**[Xinyan 6/2]{.underline}** \[Wang Xinyan, 06-02-2019, \"How to restore
the damaged U.S. credibility?,\" CGTN, accessed 7-23-2019,

\]

Thomas Schelling, a famous American professor of political economy and
Nobel laureate, pointed out in his book Arms and Influence that \"face
is one of the few things worth fighting over.\"

[[Americans have]{.mark} always [regarded their strong and reliable
reputation]{.mark} or credibility [as the pillar underpinning the world
order]{.mark}]{.underline}, and they even resort to limited wars to
establish a firm reputation and increase their bargaining chips in
international affairs.

However, [the credibility of the U.S. has **eroded in recent
years**]{.underline}, [because the U.S. government reneged on its
commitments in a series of international affairs. **Especially after the
current president took office**, the credibility of the U.S. has dropped
to a **new low**.]{.underline}

In fact, the U.S. government has been going back on its words and
behaving irresponsibly for a long time. As early as 2001, the Bush
administration announced that the \"Kyoto Protocol\" had \"fatal
defects\" and decided to unilaterally withdraw from it, which greatly
reduced the effectiveness of the \"Kyoto Protocol.\"

Under the Obama administration, the U.S. pushed for reconciliation with
Iran and finally reached a six-party nuclear agreement, which \"set free
a tiger back to the mountains\" in a way that betrayed the U.S.\'
closest ally in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia. The \"treachery\" of the
U.S. has gradually deprived it of its influence over Saudi Arabia.

Even more reckless and unscrupulous, [the current U.S. government
reneges on its words **with a vengeance**]{.underline}.

As the main builder and participant of the international economic order
and the multilateral system after World War II, [the U.S. should have
taken the lead in abiding by multilateral rules, but the U.S.
government]{.underline}, advocating \"America first,\" **[withdraws from
international agreements and institutions at every turn]{.underline}**:
withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal, the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the
United Nations Human Rights Council.

In the China-U.S. trade war, in defiance of the WTO rules advocated by
the U.S. itself and the outcomes of the China-U.S. trade talks over the
past year, U.S. President Donald [Trump insisted on imposing a 25
percent tariff on]{.underline} 200 billion U.S. dollars\' worth of
[Chinese exports to the U.S]{.underline}.

[He even accused the Chinese side of \"going back on its
words]{.underline}\" which once again gives the world a chance to see
the true colors the U.S. government as \"giving a false account of the
facts.\"

In addition, President [Trump]{.underline}, who has been prone to
\"governing the country by tweets,\" [has taken the U.S. further down
the road of dishonesty **through a large number of
\"tweets\"**]{.underline} that have proved to be false.

Public opinion polls reported by the U.S. media show that \"between
two-thirds and three-quarters of Americans do not find Trump
trustworthy.\"

According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center of the U.S., Trump
has become the world\'s least trusted leader of great power. [Americans
have more confidence in]{.underline} French President
[Macron]{.underline}, Japanese Prime Minister [Abe and]{.underline}
German Chancellor [Merkel than Trump]{.underline} in dealing with
international affairs.

At the same time, [traditional U.S. allies, such as the United Kingdom,
France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea, and Australia have
little confidence in the U.S. president]{.underline}.

Although the U.S. government does not derive its credibility from the
president\'s words and deeds alone, [Trump\'s failure to keep promises
undoubtedly **carries serious consequences for the U.S**]{.underline}.
His \"inconsistency in policy making\" and \"capriciousness\" have led
to a sharp decline in the credibility of the U.S. around the world,
making it difficult for U.S. allies to trust the commitments made by the
U.S.

According to a poll conducted by market research firm YouGov cited by
SPUTNIK, a Russian media outlet, on May 13, 45 percent of Europeans
believe that the U.S. is no longer a reliable security partner of the
European Union.

In addition, Trump does not have political experience and does not
listen to White House aides. Internationally, he often speaks carelessly
and makes remarks that are not in the interests of U.S. foreign policy;
domestically, in order to win the general election, he attacks the
\"dissidents\" within the Democratic Party and the Republican Party
without any scruple.

People no longer believe that he can effectively safeguard the
fundamental interests and the strategic intentions of the U.S., which
has led to the decline of the credibility of the U.S. government and the
weakening of the U.S. deterrence. The risks of deadly miscalculation
will increase.

As pointed out by a review in Foreign Affairs, a U.S. magazine, \"the
United States has already paid a significant price for Trump\'s
behavior: [The president is no longer considered the ultimate voice on
foreign policy. Foreign leaders are turning elsewhere to gauge American
intentions. With the U.S. domestic system so polarized and its governing
party so fragmented, communicating intent has become more difficult than
ever]{.underline}. The more bipartisan and univocal U.S. signaling is,
the less likely it is that Trump\'s damage to American credibility will
outlast his tenure."

As ancient Chinese philosophers said: \"In communication with his
subjects, he (a king) rested in good faith\"; \"he who does not keep his
promise can hardly act resolutely.\" As the most powerful country in the
world, the U.S. may be used to \"conquering\" the world with hard power
like a powerful economy and military prowess.

It must not forget that in the information age, soft power, represented
by credibility, is more important than ever. If the U.S. is to achieve
its goal of \"America first,\" perhaps it should first think about how
to restore its perilous credibility.

[There's not really much question that **[Russia's efforts to interfere

released]{.underline}, frequently [giving new ammunition to Clinton's
opponents]{.underline}, including then-candidate Donald Trump.

\"[I love WikiLeaks]{.underline}!" [Trump declared]{.underline} in
October, and for good reason: In short order, [[those leaks dominated
media attention, **distracting from allegations of improper sexual

later that month, with former FBI director James B. Comey's announcement
that the FBI had obtained new emails related to Clinton's personal

stolen by Russian actors --- was overtaken.

[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} President Donald [[Trump finished his]{.mark}
two-hour [meeting with]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.mark} on Friday, [Moscow was]{.mark}]{.underline} already
**[[declaring the]{.underline}]{.mark}** bilateral [**[sit-down a
victory for Russia]{.mark}** [and preparing to tell the
press]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Trump had accepted Putin\'s
assurances]{.underline}]{.mark} that he did not interfere in the 2016
election.

[[Russian media began celebrating]{.mark} the meeting [before it even
ended]{.mark}]{.underline}. Anchors remarked on its length, deciding a
two-hour meeting meant that Putin must be Trump\'s favorite world
leader, as tabloids declared it \"historic.\"

A Russian body language expert told Russia\'s Komsomolskaya Pravda that
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[[controlled the situation]{.mark} and
decided its tone]{.underline},\" and called the meeting \"a
psychological victory for the Russian president.\" Another tabloid said
the lengthy meeting showed [Trump had become a
\"pragmatist]{.underline}.\"

Emerging from the meeting, which he observed along with US Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told
reporters in an on-camera press briefing that Trump \"said he\'s heard
Putin\'s very clear statements that this is not true and that the
Russian government didn\'t interfere in the elections and that he
accepts these statements. That\'s all.\"

[[The White House was]{.underline}]{.mark} effectively [[forced to play
catch-up]{.underline}]{.mark}, issuing anonymous statements to dispute
Lavrov\'s characterization of the talks. \"Not accurate,\" one official
told NBC.

[[By the time]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[began pushing back]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
Lavrov\'s [[comments had ignited a social media
firestorm]{.underline}]{.mark}, and were widely accepted given Trump\'s
well-documented reluctance to accept the US intelligence community\'s
assessment that Putin tried to help him win the presidency.

\"I\'m inclined to trust Lavrov, who maintains that Trump accepted
Putin\'s denials that the Russian government was involved,\" said Mark
Kramer, the program director for the Project on Cold War Studies at
Harvard\'s Davis Center for Eurasian Affairs.

\'If, as I suspect, that is what happened, it was a key victory for
Putin,\" Kramer said. \"It shows him that he really does have a
sympathetic friend in the the White House.\"

Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk firm Eurasia Group, agreed
that [[Trump is]{.mark} \"far [closer to accepting Putin]{.mark}\'s
\'assurances\' [that Russia didn\'t hack the election than others in his
administration]{.mark}, not to mention Congress and the mainstream
media.\"]{.underline}

\"I\'m not surprised he didn\'t make a big deal about it,\" Bremmer
said. After all, in Trump\'s mind, to seriously take it up would be to
delegitimize the validity of his own election win.\"

Tillerson, for his part, said Trump had \"pressed President Putin on
more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement,\" which Putin
denied.

But [White House [officials have continued to dodge
questions]{.mark}]{.underline} about Lavrov\'s remarks, without
correcting his account: Aboard Air Force One, \"neither Mnuchin nor
McMaster deny POTUS \'accepted\' (as Russian FM Lavrov said) Putin\'s
denial of US elex cyber meddling,\" CBS correspondent Major Garett
tweeted on Saturday.

\"[What strikes me is]{.underline} that --- for the first time --- [[we
have an administration]{.underline}]{.mark} in office [[whose
credibility is]{.mark} about **[on par with the
Kremlin\'s]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" said Ned Price, a former CIA
analyst who served as the senior director of the National Security
Council under Obama.

\"When it came to conflicting accounts between Washington and Moscow,
[Americans used to be able to assume]{.underline} that [the Kremlin was
peddling bald-faced lies]{.underline},\" Price added. \"[With the
current dispute over President Trump\'s reaction to Putin\'s assurances,
however, [this administration\'s credibility deficit is coming back to
bite them]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

The lack of cohesive messaging coming out of the White House and
Trump\'s tendency to contradict his own aides --- exemplified, among
other things, by the conflicting characterizations of his travel ban and
the events leading up to his firing of former FBI Director James
Comey--- has undermined trust in the administration\'s official
statements and made it difficult to determine what is true.

The result is that, in disputes between Washington and Moscow, \"we are
left not knowing which side is telling the truth,\" Price said. \"It\'s
truly remarkable that the White House finds itself in this position, but
it does so solely due to self-inflicted wounds.\"

To be sure, there is \"no basis for trusting\" the accounts given by
Putin and Lavrov, said national security expert Claire Finkelstein, a
professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania. \"But we have heard
precious little from the American side,\" she said.

[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, who has been accused of assassinating
Russian journalists and whose control of the Russian media is nearly
absolute, [[held a press conference]{.mark} after the G20 [where he
implied]{.mark}]{.underline} on camera that [[the Kremlin **held sway
over the White House**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

\"[[We didn\'t meddle, just ask Trump]{.mark},\" Putin told
reporters]{.underline}. When one pointed out that the White House still
hadn\'t released any proof one way or the other, Putin laughed and
replied: \"We\'ll talk to the White House and tell them to fix that.\"

In refusing to hold his own press conference, Trump allowed Putin\'s
words --- and the overall Russian narrative --- to linger unchallenged
until Sunday morning, when he tweeted that he \"strongly pressed
President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He
vehemently denied it.\"

\"I\'ve already given my opinion,\" [Trump]{.underline} wrote. \"We
[negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save
lives]{.underline}. Now it is time to move forward in working
constructively with Russia!\"

But many experts have noted [that [the ceasefire deal, too, **was
negotiated on Russia\'s terms**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"The cease-fire acknowledges and formalizes Russia\'s ascendancy in
Syria, and Assad\'s remaining in power post-ISIS,\" said Glenn Carle, a
CIA veteran. \"This is a policy one can debate; but the decision gives
the appearance of having earned something for the US, when in fact it
does Moscow\'s work, at Moscow\'s behest.\"

Kramer agreed: \"[Putin is out to sideline the United States in the
Middle East]{.underline}. The meeting did not necessarily advance that
goal, but it certainly reflected it. Earlier this year, Trump, to his
credit, seemed to recognize that Putin can\'t be trusted on Syria, and I
hope that Trump will not prove to be gullible now.\"

Trump added on Sunday morning that he and Putin \"discussed forming an
impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other
negative things, will be guarded and safe.\"

That plan, too, has been met with incredulity. \"This is like giving the
alarm code to the guys who just burglarized your home. Just makes it
easier for them next time,\" tweeted Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell.

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio also weighed in: \"Partnering with Putin on
a \'Cyber Security Unit\' is akin to partnering with Assad on a
\'Chemical Weapons Unit,\'\" Rubio tweeted on Sunday.

\"Not only\" was Trump\'s tweet \'\"ludicrously worded (suggesting that
Trump wants to make election hacking \'safe\'), but also reinforces the
notion that Trump whitewashed the Russian election interference, just as
Lavrov said,\" noted Kramer.

### 2AC -- AT: Iran Deal

#### The Iran deal actually [hurts]{.underline} US credibility

**[Oren 18]{.underline}** \[Michael Oren, Israel\'s ambassador to the
United States from 2009 to 2013, 1-31-2018, \"How to restore US
credibility in the Middle East,\" CNN, accessed 7-23-2019,
https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/opinions/iran-america-deal-opinion-oren/index.html
\]

Yet no evidence was more damning than the Iranian nuclear deal. Instead
of presenting Iran\'s regime with the choice between retaining the
nuclear infrastructure unnecessary for a civilian energy program and
survival, international negotiators, led by the United States,
guaranteed both. [By lifting sanctions and reopening Iran to
international business, [the deal enabled]{.mark} the regime to
[**overcome financial crises** and]{.mark} **more brutally
[suppress]{.mark} its [domestic opponents]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

And [[rather than dismantling]{.mark} Iran\'s [nuclear
infrastructure]{.mark}, [the deal]{.mark} preserved]{.underline} it
intact [and even [permitted research and development]{.mark} of far more
advanced centrifuges]{.underline}. Under the deal\'s \"sunset clauses,\"
[the restrictions]{.underline} on enrichment [will expire in eight to 10
years]{.underline}, [at which time [Iran will be able to produce
**enough uranium for**]{.mark} **dozens of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}** in
a very short time.]{.underline}

Hearing this same viewpoint from so many influential Arabs, I couldn\'t
help but find it compelling. There was certainly a strong case for
accusing the Obama administration of pivoting toward Iran. Still, as an
Israeli familiar with American policymaking, I did not believe that the
United States had pursued a grand strategy of abandoning the Sunni world
in favor of the Islamic Republic. Rather, I believed that American
leaders made decisions in the Middle East that, even if inadvertently,
benefited Iran. Yet as an Israeli, I cannot afford to ignore widespread
perceptions in the Arab world. And neither should Americans.

[[There is much discussion over the international impact]{.mark} of
nullifying or amending the Iranian nuclear deal]{.underline}. Advocates
of the deal warn that canceling it will cost America credibility abroad
and alienate important allies. But it is **[[the deal
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[**has created a credibility
deficit** for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in the Middle East,
**[weakening America\'s ability to overcome threats and mediate
peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Destabilizing actors, first among them
Iran, have exploited the perceived decline in America\'s regional
prestige. Now, after 50 years of US dominance in the Middle East \-- the
so-called Pax Americana \-- [Russia has returned as a regional
power]{.underline}.

Fortunately, the process of restoring America\'s stature in the Middle
East has begun. President Donald Trump\'s recent decision to decertify
the nuclear deal and submit it for congressional revision was broadly
hailed in both the Arab states and Israel. So, too, was the 120-day
deadline he set for Europe to amend the deal.

Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, similarly gained
credit for focusing UN attention on the serial violations of the
Security Council bans of Iran\'s ballistic missile tests and its
bankrolling of terror. The support that the White House gave to many
thousands of Iranians who recently demonstrated against the ayatollahs\'
repressive regime was also greeted throughout our region as a sign of
revived moral clarity.

But more remains to be done. The international community, led by the
United States, could mount a campaign to roll back Iranian conquests and
combat Iranian-backed terror such as the reported 2011 plan \--
thankfully thwarted \-- to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the
United States and blow up a popular restaurant in Washington. The
production and testing of ICBMs by Iran must also instantly and
completely stop.

Most crucially, [[efforts **must be made**]{.mark}]{.underline} either
[[to cancel the]{.mark} nuclear [deal]{.mark}]{.underline} or link it to
Iranian behavior. A regime complicit in the massacre of a half-million
Syrians cannot, for example, possess the means to make nuclear bombs.
The dangers of the \"sunset clause\" must be addressed by assuring that
the deal\'s restrictions will never expire as long as Iran is ruled by a
terror-sponsoring regime. Meanwhile, international inspectors must have
access to all of Iran\'s nuclear-related facilities, including the
military sites currently exempted by the deal.

Standing firmly with its Arab and Israeli allies against Iran will
contribute immensely to restoring America\'s credibility in the Middle
East. It will have a material and positive effect on nonproliferation
efforts elsewhere in the world. Reinstating the Pax Americana will help
Arabs and Israelis meet in an atmosphere of renewed confidence in the
United States and its paramount role in our region.

### 2AC -- AT: North Korea

#### Summits only make everything worse

North Korea spectacle shows he'd do anything, even undercut America, for
attention,\" USA TODAY, accessed 7-23-2019,

\]

President Donald [[Trump loves]{.mark} big foreign policy [events that
draw the nation's attention]{.mark}]{.underline} to --- well, President
Donald Trump.

He went to London recently for the spectacle of dining with the queen,
ignoring the fact that he could have no meaningful discussions with her
government, which is in a state of transition, if not outright
paralysis. He also savors his meetings with Russian President Vladimir
Putin because the outrage they draw merely amps up the attention. But
[[nothing is like his approach to No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}, where [[he'll **apparently do
anything**]{.mark}**, potentially [even undermining America\'s
interests]{.mark},**]{.underline} for the coverage it brings.

As the result of a tweet, which seems to be the foundation of a lot of
his on-the-go policymaking, [[Trump met with]{.mark} North Korean
dictator [Kim Jong Un]{.mark} on Sunday to announce the reopening of
nuclear talks]{.underline}.

[[To Trump, the get-together was a grand spectacle]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Not only has he already become the first U.S. president to meet with a
North Korean leader, he did so this time on North Korean soil, which is
also a first. But he has been down this road before with little in the
way of results. When Trump first met with Kim, in Singapore a year ago,
he also drew the world's attention. Then after a second meeting in
Vietnam in February, the talks broke off. Now he's at it again.

There's more here than self-promotion, though. [[In constantly providing
a stage]{.mark} for Kim, [Trump is **giving him legitimacy and global
standing**]{.mark} **that [he]{.mark} most assuredly [does not
deserve]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Making matters worse, [Trump is]{.underline}, according to The New York
Times, [considering recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power and
**merely asking for it to freeze its arsenal**, rather than giving it
up]{.underline}. That's a step back from where Kim was last year, when
he promised to denuclearize.

Not that it is likely Kim would follow through with either. North Korea
has a long history of reneging on pledges to eliminate or freeze its
nuclear weapons program. These pledges go back to 1985, when it joined a
nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and 1992, when North Korea and South
Korea signed a pact to denuclearize the peninsula. In 1994, it
negotiated a deal with former President Jimmy Carter to freeze its
program.

To give Kim so much upfront now, in hopes that he will reform his ways,
is unwise. Other rogue nations will be encouraged to follow suit,
developing their own nuclear arsenals and forcing their way onto the
U.S. president's agenda.

Indeed, Iranian leaders, who signed a deal to freeze their nuclear
program in 2015, have to see the way their nation is being treated even
as Trump coddles North Korea. Making a nuclear deal without weapons in
hand has left Iran vulnerable to renewed sanctions from an
administration hellbent on blowing up the agreement. On Monday, Iran's
foreign minister announced that his country had exceeded the enrichment
caps set down by the accord.

Now, [instead of one nuclear headache in North Korea, Trump\'s diplomacy
has resuscitated a second, making each more difficult to
address]{.underline}. So far, Trump\'s diplomatic moves in Iran and
North Korea have shown great success in focusing international attention
on the White House --- but they show little sign of tangible nuclear
progress.

[[Commenting on the credibility of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, a
military analyst]{.underline} and retired Lebanese Army General Amin
Hteit told Sputnik that [[the confusion surrounding]{.mark} the
[withdrawal]{.mark} of American troops [undermines it]{.mark}. Moreover,
[from the very beginning]{.mark}, [the mechanism of the pullout
operation]{.mark} of US military forces [wasn\'t clear]{.mark}, [now
everything is becoming]{.mark} even [more complicated]{.mark}, and
[trust]{.mark} into the statements [of American politicians is
diminishing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"[Americans want to retain control]{.underline} over the At Tanf base
[for several reasons]{.underline}. Firstly, [it is needed to support the
terrorists and their families]{.underline}, who live in camps nearby.
Secondly, [the base is close to the border]{.underline} with Jordan and
Iraq and this allows \[the US\] to influence the security situation in
the entire region. The Americans understand that as soon as they leave,
the Syrian army will immediately put an end to the militants,\" the
former Lebanese Army General explained.

Amin Hteit also stressed that he believes that the American forces can
stay in Syria for a long time to cover up for terrorists and achieve
other strategic goals. They will continue to work in the east of the
Euphrates and in Al-Hasakah province in northern Syria.

His remarks came after, on 19 December, US President Donald Trump
declared victory over Daesh\* in Syria and announced his decision to
withdraw US forces from the country on Twitter.

\"So our boys, our young women, our men, they\'re all coming back and
they\'re coming back now. We won, and that\'s the way we want it\",
Trump said in a video post.

[[Following]{.mark} a [backlash]{.mark} over his initial announcement,

[[If credibility is defined here as acting on a promise]{.mark} to do
something]{.underline}, however aimlessly and grudgingly, in the face of
a red line violation, [[then perhaps the administration can claim a
victory of sorts]{.underline}]{.mark}. But are the intended recipients
of this message really so naive as to be awed by such a superficial show
of force? [[Iran, Hezbollah, and]{.mark} the [Syria]{.mark}n regime are
sophisticated and seasoned political players who]{.underline}, despite
their occasional mistakes, **[will not confuse hollow gestures with

and lacking the vision or resolve to exercise power responsibly in a
critical and changing part of the world.]{.underline}

[The use of chemical weapons against one's own population, in violation

Commander-in-Chief of the world's most powerful military, [is a
watershed moment in the Syrian conflict]{.underline}. [Rather than
restore the United States' standing in international relations,
**[reacting with a]{.mark} symbolic [US strike]{.mark} [will show the

[The Syrian regime will wait]{.underline} for this latest storm to pass,
[and promptly resume its war of annihilation by]{.underline} other,
[non-chemical means after US operations are concluded]{.underline}. The
sort of action the United States is contemplating may well prevent the
further use of chemical weapons by the regime. It will also clearly show
however that President Obama's red line was not aimed at constraining
the regime's ability to kill its population, but at exempting a
reluctant leader from having to address the festering conflict in Syria.

#### Trump has improved US credibility -- Middle East proves

President [[Trump has]{.mark} **dramatically [reshaped fo]{.mark}reign
[po]{.mark}licy [in the Middle East]{.mark}**]{.underline} during his
first year in office. [[His agenda has **strengthened
diplo**]{.mark}**matic [relations]{.mark}**]{.underline} with key allies
and involved a more pro-active approach to addressing threats in the
region.

Indeed, [[these policies include hindering Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
growing influence, **[[combating extremist
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[expanding U.S.-Israeli
relations]{.mark}**, [and **restoring relationships with key
Arab**]{.mark}]{.underline}-state **[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This policy agenda has helped stabilize the Middle East and the results
are showing. Americans should feel assured that President Trump and his
team are working to restore U.S. leadership and credibility in the
region.

This task hasn't been easy coming off the shortcomings of the Obama
administration's foreign policy agenda. Obama and his team attempted to
combat threats through appeasement rather than action. Appeasement led
to a failing nuclear deal with Iran, the rise of several radical Islamic
terrorist groups, and a leadership gap in the region. Our allies
rightfully questioned if America was retreating from its security
obligations.

Thankfully, the current administration executed a 180-degree course
correction to this misguided agenda. [Trump **[decertified the Iran
nuclear deal]{.mark}** and the U.S. Treasury Department slapped [**new
sanctions** on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}ian
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Trump recently noted that [he would no
longer waive sanctions against Iran unless dramatic steps are taken to
fix the deal]{.underline}.

Trump also provided support to Iranian protestors who took to the
streets to voice their opposition to the regime's rampant corruption,
constant violation of human rights, and consistent funding of terrorism
abroad. "Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back
their corrupt government. You will see great support from the United
States at the appropriate time!" Trump noted on Twitter.

In addition to countering Iran's growing influence, President [Trump has
made **enhancing U.S.-Israeli relations a top priority**]{.underline}.
Nowhere is this better illustrated than with the declaration of
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. "I have determined that it is time
to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While
previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed
to deliver. Today, I am delivering," noted Trump during the
announcement. Trump formally recognized an obvious truth: Jerusalem is
the rightful capital of Israel.

Furthermore, officials from the administration and Israeli government
recently penned a joint strategic initiative to push-back against Iran's
nuclear and ballistic missile program. The U.S. also opened its first
permanent military base in the country.

Our Arab-state allies have felt motivated to combat Iran and other
extremist groups after commitments from the current administration.
[Trump doubled-down on our alliance with Saudi]{.underline} Arabia days
after an unprecedented rocket attack on the royal palace from an
Iranian-backed terrorist group. [Trump **[reassured the Saudi
government]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[any attack]{.mark}]{.underline}
on Saudi Arabia [[will be considered an attack on the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The administration has also stepped up efforts to counter radical
Islamic groups in the region. To date, ISIS has almost lost over 98
percent of its territory --- largely since President Trump took office.
Bounties have been issued on top Hezbollah leaders and Attorney General
Jeff Sessions has ordered an investigation into a recent Politico report
that Obama looked the other way as Hezbollah smuggled cocaine into the
U.S.

Finally, President Trump has actively worked to assist religious
minorities who have been displaced by ISIS. The administration announced
it will bypass the United Nations and deliver much-needed aid to
Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities.

The administration has delivered on its promise to put America and its
allies first and take a much more hands-on approach to foreign policy.
[President [Trump and his team are]{.mark} rightfully [restoring U.S.

Remember Sen. [Tom [Cotton's letter to Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}? These
days, you can bet that the leaders of Iran do.

The letter, sent [in March 2015, [was one of those events that
seemed]{.mark} like a [major]{.mark} outrage]{.underline} at the time
but now feels like such ancient history that the letter might as well
have been written on parchment. At the height of the debate over the
Obama administration's nuclear diplomacy with Iran, [the Arkansas
senator organized a group of 47 Republican colleagues to send a letter
to the "leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran" explaining "features of
our Constitution ... which you should consider seriously as negotiations
progress."]{.underline} Noting that [[any deal would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} merely [[an "executive agreement]{.mark} between
President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei**" [rather than a formal
treaty]{.mark}**]{.underline} ratified by Congress and that Barack Obama
would be leaving office in January 2017, the letter warned that [[the
next president would revoke it "**with the stroke of a
pen**."]{.underline}]{.mark}

Democrats were livid about what they saw as a Republican attempt to
sabotage ongoing diplomatic negotiations. It certainly was that, but the
thing is, [[Cotton was]{.mark} completely [right]{.mark}]{.underline}:
On May 8, 2018, Donald [[Trump pulled the U.S. out of the
deal]{.underline}]{.mark} the Obama administration had negotiated and
re-imposed sanctions lifted as part of it. Tensions between the two
countries have been rising ever since.

[The five other countries]{.underline} that were party to the deal and
the European Union [are still committed to it, as is Iran, but just
barely.]{.underline} This week, Iranian nuclear officials announced that
they had quadrupled the country's uranium enrichment production, putting
them on a path to exceed limits set by the accord.

[[If the Iranian regime stays in compliance]{.underline}]{.mark} with
the deal[, [it may be only because they know Trump won't be in office
forever, either.]{.mark}]{.underline} Most of the Democratic candidates
running for president in 2020 have promised to rejoin the Iran deal,
which would entail lifting the sanctions that Trump has re-imposed.
Ironically, Democrats have been borrowing from the Republicans' old
playbook with former Secretary of State John Kerry, who spent years
negotiating the original deal, meeting with his Iranian counterparts in
an attempt so salvage it. In both cases, critics of these actions
invoked the Logan Act, the oft-cited but never enforced law barring U.S.
citizens from conducting unauthorized negotiations with foreign
governments. "He told them to wait out the Trump Administration!" an
enraged Trump tweeted.

[[Waiting out]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[is]{.mark} a [popular]{.mark} idea these
days]{.underline}. Susan Thornton, the former acting assistant secretary
of state, told a gathering in Shanghai earlier this month that China
should be patient amid the ongoing trade war and not rush to resolve it,
telling the audience, "If this skeptical attitude towards talking
diplomacy continues in this administration, you might have to wait till
another administration." The parties to the Paris climate agreement may
also be somewhat heartened that every major Democratic candidate has
pledged to keep the U.S. in the agreement. (The U.S. will technically
still be a party to the Paris agreement until November 2020 at the
earliest, despite Trump's withdrawal announcement in 2017.)

[[This isn't a very encouraging state of affairs]{.underline}]{.mark},
and not only because there's a decent chance Trump will be reelected in
2020. [[If it becomes the norm]{.mark} that [agreements struck]{.mark}
by a U.S. president [will be kept only so long as that president's party
is in power]{.mark}, **[why would any country ever sign a deal with the
U.S.]{.mark} ever again**]{.underline}? If the entire disposition of
U.S. foreign policy transforms depending on whether a Democrat or a
Republican occupies the White House, it will have a destabilizing impact
on international relations long after Trump leaves office.

#### Trump's impacts are overblown -- narratives

Atlantic and a senior fellow at the Project on U.S. Relations with the
Islamic World at the Brookings Institution, 4-11-2019, \"The Fundamental
Legitimacy of Donald Trump,\" Atlantic, accessed 7-23-2019,

Special Counsel Robert [Mueller's inquiry into links between Russia and
the president's campaign could have turned out so much worse for Donald
Trump]{.underline}. It almost seemed certain that it would. But it
didn't. The end of the Mueller investigation has now made hollow the
maximalist charges of collusion against Trump and his team.

[The collusion claim was]{.underline} an indirect---or direct---way of
[saying]{.underline} that Donald [Trump was illegitimately
elected]{.underline}. For Mueller's team to stop short of concluding
that collusion had occurred, then, was the best possible result for
American democracy. Citizens should be relieved, not disappointed, when
the legitimacy of election outcomes is strengthened, however much we
dislike them.

[[Conspiracy with Russia]{.mark} wasn't the only thing]{.underline} that
[commentators]{.underline}---both liberals and Never Trump
conservatives---[got wrong, though]{.underline}. There was another,
related charge that was graver and, on its face, more implausible: that
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} would (or [[could]{.mark}) [destroy]{.mark}
American [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And he would do so with the
help of]{.underline} his [Russian]{.underline} enablers. Here, the two
claims came together---that the Russians wished to end the American
experiment and that Trump provided the vehicle for their ambitious
designs.

This was part of a grand narrative. [But [what if the
narrative]{.mark}]{.underline} of American democracy under mortal
threat---with or without Russian help---**[[was]{.mark} fundamentally
[flawed from the]{.mark} very [start]{.mark}]{.underline}**?

[[Grand]{.mark} [narratives]{.mark} are appealing because **they [help
us comprehend the incomprehensible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this case,
they helped to make sense of the endless shock of Donald Trump's
victory. The democracy-is-doomed narrative is crumbling, and rarely do
you hear it anymore---at least not with the full-throated zeal that
became routine throughout 2017 and 2018.

It began before that, during the campaign. As The New Yorker's Adam
Gopnik wrote: "Hitler's enablers in 1933---yes, we should go there,
instantly and often, not to blacken our political opponents but as a
reminder that evil happens insidiously, and most often with people on
the same side telling each other, Well, he's not so bad, not as bad as
they are. We can control him." This sort of thing continued for more
than two years.

On January 4, 2018, despite the helpful information that America hadn't
become a dictatorship in 2017, Vox's Matt Yglesias wrote in an article
titled "2018 Is the Year That Will Decide If Trumpocracy Replaces
American Democracy" that "Trump has been extremely long on demagogic
bluster but rather conventional---if extremely right-wing in some
respects---on policy. But ... this is entirely typical. Even Adolf
Hitler was dismissed by many as a buffoon."

[Preemptively suggesting]{.underline} that [your ideological opponents
won't accept the results of elections if they lose isn't nearly as bad
as, well, not accepting the results of elections]{.underline}, [but it
is still bad]{.underline}. In the case of the 2018 midterm elections, it
also happened to be wrong. The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman
wrote: "Remember, Donald Trump claimed---falsely, of course---that
millions of immigrants voted illegally in an election he won. Imagine
what he'll say if he loses, and what his supporters will do in
response." Krugman went on, suggesting that those who voted for the
other party were, in fact, voting for autocracy: "If we take one path,
it will offer at least a chance for political redemption, for recovering
America's democratic values. If we take the other, we'll be on the road
to autocracy, with no obvious way to get off."

Claims such as these weren't just overblown rhetoric from pundits in the
heat of the electoral moment. They came with the imprimatur of some of
the country's most respected political scientists. Harvard University's
Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt published How Democracies Die in
2018, and the book became an alarmist bible (even though the book itself
is more nuanced than its enthusiasts let on). In New York, Jonathan
Chait wrote, "It is hard to read this fine book without coming away
terribly concerned about the possibility Trump might inflict a mortal
wound on the health of the republic."

[[How could so many get it wrong?]{.underline}]{.mark} Underlying these
various accounts of doom is a major analytical flaw. In some sense, the
flaw is so obvious that I wasn't entirely aware of it until I started
thinking about this article. If we exclude cases of military conquest or
occupation, as occurred during World War II, there is no clear case of a
long-standing, consolidated democracy becoming an autocracy. Democracies
backslide---it is a spectrum, after all. But democracies, or at least
certain kinds of democracies, do not "die."

#### Trump doesn't matter -- he puts spin on attacks

**[AP 6/29]{.underline}** \[AP News, 6-29-2019, \"Trump dismisses
Carter\'s attacks on his legitimacy,\" accessed 7-23-2019,
https://www.apnews.com/43d96300639a432c859fb174767460fe \]

WASHINGTON (AP) --- [President Donald [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} on
Saturday [[dismissed Jimmy Carter's swipe at]{.mark} the
[legitimacy]{.mark} of his election and said the charge was nothing more
than a "Democrat talking point]{.underline}," while offering his own
digs at the 94-year-old former commander in chief.

[[Trump]{.mark} said he [was surprised by Carter's comments]{.mark}
alleging]{.underline} that [Russian interference in the]{.underline}
2016 [election was responsible]{.underline} for putting Trump in the
White House. [**[The Republican punched back]{.mark}**, though with a
somewhat muted response, at least for him.]{.underline}

"**[Look, [he was a nice man]{.mark}. He was a terrible president. [He's
a Democrat. And it's a typical talking point]{.mark}. He's loyal to the
Democrats. And I guess you should be]{.underline}**," Trump told
reporters at a news conference in Japan, adding that, "[as everybody now
understands, I won not because of Russia, not because of anybody but
myself]{.underline}."

Carter made his comments during a discussion on human rights at a resort
in Leesburg, Virginia on Friday. Carter had said there was "no doubt
that the Russians did interfere" in 2016.

The 39th president alleged that that interference, "though not yet
quantified, if fully investigated would show that Trump didn't actually
win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put into
office because the Russians interfered on his behalf."

U.S. intelligence agencies asserted in a 2017 report that Russia had
worked to help Trump during the election and to undermine the candidacy
of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But the intelligence agencies did
not assess whether that interference had affected the election or
contributed to Trump's victory. No evidence has emerged that votes were
changed improperly.

Trump insisted during the news conference marking the end of a Group of
20 summit in Osaka that he had won because he'd worked harder and
smarter than Clinton. He claimed that he'd "felt badly" for Carter
because of the way he'd "been trashed within his own party."

["[He's been badly trashed]{.mark}," said Trump. "[He's like the
forgotten president]{.mark}. And I understand why they say that. [He was
not a good president]{.mark}."]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Russian Ties

#### US-Russia relations are getting worse, but [arms are key]{.underline}

**[Rumer and Sokolsky 18]{.underline}** \[Eugene Rumer, director of the
Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, and Richard Sokolsky, nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, 6-20-2018, \"How to Rethink
U.S.-Russian Relations Today,\" Time, accessed 7-23-2019,
https://time.com/5610524/u-s-russian-relations/ \]

For thirty years, since the end of the Cold War, [U.S. [policy toward
Russia has been going in circles with the relationship **getting
worse**]{.mark}]{.underline} as different U.S. administrations came and
went. Today, [[the]{.mark} U.S.-Russian [relationship is at **the
lowest**]{.mark} **point** [since]{.mark} before [the Cold War]{.mark}
ended and the best we can hope for is that it will not get even
worse]{.underline}.

Russia is to blame for most of what went wrong in this relationship. It
invaded Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, it interfered in the 2016
United States presidential election, and it continues to meddle in
Venezuela, in Syria, in Libya, etc. But it takes two to tango. Rarely,
have U.S. policymakers questioned U.S. policy toward Russia. Have we
done everything right?

A look back at the record of the Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George
W. Bush presidencies' dealings with Russia produces surprising results.
These three very different administrations embraced the same set of
policies toward Russia. They were built around two pillars: [a refusal
to accept Russia for what it was and insistence that it reform itself to
better fit the image of what U.S. policymakers thought Russia should
look like; and the view that NATO was the only legitimate European
security organization, while expanding it ever deeper into the former
Soviet lands]{.underline}. [Russia rejected both of these, but U.S.
policymakers proceeded with these policies anyway **on the assumption
that sooner or later Russia would recognize what was good for
it.**]{.underline} In the community of Russia hands it became known as
the "spinach treatment"---kids don't like spinach, but should eat it
because it's good for them.

[[Every]{.mark} U.S. [administration has gone through the]{.mark}
boom-bust [cycle]{.mark} in its dealings [with
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Clinton administration took charge of
the relationship in 1993 and promised to build a partnership with
Russian democracy, Russian reforms, Russian markets. The two
presidents---[[Clinton]{.mark} and]{.underline} Russia's Boris
[Yeltsin]{.underline}---[[built a strong personal
bond]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet the road to [[partnership
became]{.underline}]{.mark} more and more [[difficult as disagreements
arose]{.mark} over Russia's slow reform progress, NATO expansion, the
Kosovo campaign, and much else]{.underline}. [By the end of the 1990s
**[both sides grew frustrated]{.mark} with each other.**]{.underline}
The Clinton chapter of that relationship ended amid fears that Yeltsin's
successor, Vladimir Putin, was backsliding on democracy.

Despite these misgivings, the George W. [[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[attempted to build]{.mark} its own [partnership]{.mark}
with Russia]{.underline}. In 2001, Bush and Putin pledged to build a new
relationship based on a "joint commitment to democracy, free market, and
the rule of law." [[That]{.mark} relationship **[followed the familiar
pattern as disagreements arose]{.mark}**]{.underline}---over [the Iraq
war, Russian backsliding on democracy, and NATO expansion]{.underline}.
In 2008, following NATO's pledge of future membership to former Soviet
republics Georgia and Ukraine, Russia crushed the tiny Georgian military
as the United States and its NATO allies watched, but did not interfere.
Russia effectively declared the former Soviet states off limits to NATO.
The relationship with Russia was once again at the lowest point since
the Cold War.

The [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[attempted to
"reset"]{.mark} the relationship with Russia and launched its own
partnership]{.underline}. The idea there was to modernize its economy
and liberalize its politics. [**[That]{.mark} too [proved
short-lived]{.mark}**, as hopes for both political liberalization and
economic modernization proved unrealistic]{.underline}. Russia's
invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014 plunged
U.S.-Russian relations to yet a new low, only to be followed by Russian
meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[attempted its own
"reset"]{.mark} with Russia but [**did not get far** as]{.mark}
Russia-related [scandals and investigations
proliferated.]{.mark}]{.underline} Sanctions have become not just a tool
of U.S. policy toward Russia, but the replacement for it. The
relationship is at an impasse, while a reasoned policy discussion about
Russia is not possible because the issue has become toxic in U.S.
domestic politics.

This situation is not sustainable. The time has come to recognize that
[[Russia is not going to change]{.mark} its domestic arrangements to
suit U.S. preferences, and **[conditioning]{.mark} U.S. [policy on
such]{.mark} a change [is pointless]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similarly,
[Russia is not going to change its view of NATO]{.underline} and accept
further enlargement to include Ukraine and Georgia---both countries with
which it shares a long and complicated history, and in which it has much
greater interests than the United States. The United States and its
allies are not prepared to go to war for Ukraine or Georgia. Russia is
and has. That is a clear indicator that the goal of their membership in
the alliance is unrealistic and should be dropped.

After multiple failed attempts to build a partnership with Russia the
time has come to give up that idea. [[Instead, U.S. policy should focus
on]{.mark} issues of critical importance to the United
States]{.underline}. **[[Nuclear weapons, arms control]{.mark}, and
strategic stability are one such set of issues.]{.underline}**

[The existing U.S.-Russian arms control framework is
unraveling]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces ([INF]{.underline}) [Treaty is practically dead following Russian
violations of it and U.S. decision to abandon it in
response]{.underline}. [The New START Treaty due to expire in early 2021
can be extended and thus saved, but]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [seems more inclined to pursue frivolously a trilateral
U.S.-Russia-China treaty instead, which neither Russia nor China seems
interested in discussing.]{.underline} The existing arms control
framework may not look like much to its critics, but it is vastly better
than nothing---at a time when new technologies are threatening to
undermine the delicate balance of terror between the two nuclear
superpowers.

### 1NC -- War Powers CP

#### Text: The United States Federal Government should 

- enforce Article I, Section 8, Clause 11

- comply with War Powers Resolution of 1973

- pass the Reclamation of War Powers Act

#### That solves -- takes powers away from the President and back to Congress

**[Himes 17]{.underline}** \[Congressman Himes. "Himes leads bipartisan
Reclamation of War Powers Act." *Federal government*, 9 March 2017,
[himes.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/himes-leads-bipartisan-reclamation-war-powers-act](https://himes.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/himes-leads-bipartisan-reclamation-war-powers-act)\]

WASHINGTON, DC---Today, Congressman Jim Himes (CT-04) and Walter Jones
(NC-03) along with Peter Welch (VT-At-Large), Seth Moulton (MA-06),
Ruben Gallego (AZ-07), Kathleen Rice (NY-04) and Kurt Schrader (OR-05)
introduced [[The Reclamation of W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct, a bill that
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} explicitly [[return the power
to]{.mark}]{.underline} declare and [[wage war **back to**
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as the Constitution
requires]{.underline}.

"The [[power]{.underline}]{.mark} to make war [[is **explicitly
granted** to Congress in Article I Section 8 of the
Constitution]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Himes. "Over many decades,
[[however]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[this power has
**migrated**]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[to the
President]{.underline}]{.mark}. We are now in a situation where military
actions are carried out by the US around the world without the explicit
approval of Congress and under the auspices of Authorizations for Use of
Military Force from many years ago. [[It's an abrogation of Congress's
**Constitutional duties** and]{.mark} we have an [**obligation** to take
back that power]{.mark} on behalf of the American people]{.underline}. "

"For years, [Congress has abdicated its constitutional war powers to the
executive branch]{.underline}," said Congressman Jones. "It is time we
reclaim our duties and hold debate over the decision to wage war. Our
men and women in uniform deserve that at the very least."

"The explicit constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and
authorize the use of military force has eroded," said Congressman Welch.
"Our legislation reclaims that authority consistent with the
Constitution and eliminates any excuse by Congress to avoid tough votes
by staying the sidelines."

[[The bill has two main provisions]{.underline}]{.mark}:

· [[Congresses won't fund the introduction of US armed forces into
hostilities without a declaration of war]{.underline}]{.mark}, specific
statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by an attack or
imminent threat of attack upon the United States, its territories or
possessions, or the Armed Forces.

· [[When requesting a declaration of war or]{.underline}]{.mark}
Authorization for Use of Military Force ([[AUMF]{.underline}]{.mark}),
[[the President must issue a report outlining the threat
faced]{.underline}]{.mark}, the objectives and justifications of the
conflict [[and a description of the anticipated scope and duration of
the action]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Only Congress has the constitutional power to declare war

**[Wehle 6/25]{.underline}** \[Kim Wehle is a former assistant U.S.
attorney and a former associate independent counsel in the Whitewater

Thus far, [[Trump ordered]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and then aborted ---
[[a missile strike]{.underline}]{.mark} following Tehran's takedown of a
\$100 million U.S. Navy drone, [[**without** Congress's
blessing]{.underline}]{.mark}.

More recently, as a second-order reprimand for Iranian provocations, he
increased sanctions on Iran's supreme leader and a handful of military
commanders.

Recall, too, that in May 2018, [[Trump backed out of
a]{.underline}]{.mark}n Obama-brokered [[nuclear deal with
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} and five other nations, including China and
Russia. Among other things, the deal restricted the amount of nuclear
fuel Iran could harbor over the next 15 years. The idea was to stretch
out the timeframe in which Iran could realistically build a nuclear
bomb. In exchange, [[Iran won the lifting of]{.underline}]{.mark}
certain [[international **sanctions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Trump
reinstated sanctions. And here we are.

Regardless of where one stands on the wisdom of Trump's foreign policy
towards Iran, this is an (otherwise rare) area where Trump has not yet
pushed the boundaries of presidential power. Those boundaries crumbled
long ago.

[[Under the Constitution]{.underline}]{.mark}, the president is
commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces, but [[Congress has the
power to declare war]{.underline}]{.mark}, to raise and support armies,
to provide for a navy, and to make laws for the armed forces. This
division of military power sets up a classic chicken-and-egg problem:
Must the president await a congressional declaration of war before he
utilizes military force? Or so long as Congress creates an army and a
navy, can the president use those forces as he sees fit?

Most scholars believe that the framers of the Constitution believed that
[[the president is empowered]{.mark} to use his powers [to **repel**
sudden attacks]{.mark}, [but not]{.mark} to affirmatively [**initiate**
conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Others argue that the president is the
ultimate boss on this question, and that Congress can only ratify his
decisions to engage in armed conflict.

But as a practical matter, [[Congress **hardly declares wars**
anymore]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [the U.S. has semi-permanent military
installations all over the globe.]{.underline} Moreover, America
coordinates its use of military forces with other nations, so the line
between war and diplomacy is a blurry one.

In 1973, Congress passed a statute known as the War Powers Resolution
--- over President Nixon's veto --- in an effort to claw back its
wartime prerogative under the Constitution. Broadly speaking, [[the law
**requires** that the president **consult** with Congress before
thrusting armed forces]{.mark} into hostilities]{.underline}. The
president must also report back to Congress for permission to keep up a
war effort. [[But the statute has not been consistently
**enforced**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and presidents have balked at its
constitutionality. In 2002 --- in the wake of 9/11 --- Congress took a
big step in strengthening the president's hand in this power struggle:
It pre-authorized President George W. Bush to use force in Iraq. Bush
later launched a pre-emptive war.

At the end of the day, [[the president can do what he wants]{.mark} to
do [with]{.mark} U.S. [military forces unless]{.mark}]{.underline}
somebody---that is, **[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[stops
him]{.underline}]{.mark}. What would that stoppage look like? Well,
Congress could pull back on military funding, effectively starving the
president's budget so that he can't launch attacks even if he wanted to.
In the extreme, this option is unworkable, because the president has to
be able to respond to immediate threats.

Alternatively, Congress could pass a "we mean it" statute to shore up
its war powers again, but without enforcement, such rules are
meaningless. We know this from everyday life: Speed limits only matter
if you receive a speeding ticket. Same goes for the government. If
politicians can get away with things, they get away with things.

As a third option, [[Congress could go to court]{.mark} and ask a
federal judge [to order a president to comply with the
W]{.mark}]{.underline}ar [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers
[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esolution [[and Article I's vesting of the power
to declare war in the Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}. But a president
would be able to muster formidable constitutional arguments in response
to such a lawsuit, and a court might refuse to wade into that muck
anyway.

SAUDI ARABIA.\" *VICE News*, 6 June 2019,
news.vice.com/en_us/article/qv7e9x/how-congress-plans-to-stop-trump-selling-arms-to-saudi-arabia\]

A bipartisan group in the [[Senate]{.underline}]{.mark} --- including
some of Trump's top allies --- [[are planning]{.underline}]{.mark} a
vote this summer [[to block the sale of]{.underline}]{.mark} \$8 billion
in [[American weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark} to a regime implicated in
the death and dismemberment of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi,
as well as using those weapons to commit atrocities in Yemen.

The Senate coalition ranges from progressives to libertarians who are
outraged that top administration officials are claiming there's an
emergency in the Middle East that warrants them making those sales
without approval of Congress.

"I think there's a growing number of people and a growing resistance to
allowing the government to operate by emergency," Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)
told VICE News while rushing through the underbelly of the Capitol on
the way to cast a vote. "So I think that you're going to see the biggest
vote we've had."

It won't be the first time Congress has tried to force a historic vote
on the War Powers Act. In March, both the House and the Senate voted to
end U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen, but Trump vetoed the measure.

This time, [[lawmakers are planning to force individual votes on all 22
of the arms sales already approved by the
administratio]{.mark}n]{.underline}. And even Trump's normally reliable
Senate allies are preparing to confront the Trump administration on the
Senate floor because they see the arms sales as an executive power grab.

EXECUTIVE POWER GRAB

"Clearly I disagree with it," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who chairs
the Judiciary Committee and is a lead sponsor of this effort, told VICE
News on his way to a bank of elevators at the Capitol.

Foreign arms sales are supposed to go through Congress, but at the end
of last month Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed Iran posed a big
enough threat to American interests that he declared an emergency in
order to go around Congress.

"It's a moment of confrontation with the administration over fundamental
foreign policy in this country"

But senators in both parties aren't buying that line --- even after they
were given classified briefings on Iran last month.

"I really think it's a moment of confrontation with the administration
over fundamental foreign policy in this country," Senate Minority Whip
Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told VICE News.

While Saudi Arabia has been a top American ally for decades, Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman (or MBS) lost the faith of many senators
after the American intelligence community found he\'d helped orchestrate
the torture and [killing of Khashoggi]{.underline} last October.

[[Trump has **rejected** those findings even after the CIA concluded top
Saudi officials not only condoned but **ordered the
operation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

NUKE TECHNOLOGY

This week Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) revealed [[the
D]{.underline}]{.mark}epartment [[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}nergy [[has been helping Saudi Arabia attain
highly sensitive nuclear information]{.underline}]{.mark} --- at least
[[twice since the **dismemberment of Khashoggi**]{.underline}]{.mark},
which the agency has confirmed. And that information is raising red
flags on its own, according to Kaine.

"I'm worried about our people getting these approvals --- these
business-as-usual approvals --- to transfer nuclear technology to the
Saudis because they're close to the Trump family," Kaine told VICE News.
"It's not business as usual. It's business as un-usual with the Saudis,
and we need to understand why."

While Kaine's revelation is slowly getting out to the Senate, and
angering his colleagues in both parties along the way, there was already
momentum building to rebuke the Trump administration for attempting to
conduct arms sales without approval from Congress.

"Even though I may support the actual sale of defensive weaponry, I
don't support the administration going around the existing congressional
review process," Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told reporters on his way to
vote. "I don't believe the administration should be able to go around
what Congress has always done."

[[Rubio]{.underline}]{.mark} says he still needs to review the exact
language of the 22 resolutions to disapprove of the arms sales, but his
[[gut is leaning toward rejecting Trump's latest attempt to circumvent
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

That's what's brought about this strange bipartisan mix of lawmakers who
are ready to rebuke Trump and his top officials for what they say is
playing fast and loose with the constitutional separation of powers.

[[People on both sides]{.underline}]{.mark} of the political divide
[[don\'t get why the president wouldn't just ask for congressional
approval for arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}, like most of his
presidential predecessors have done.

### 2NC -- Solvency -- Yemen War

#### War in Yemen is illegal -- Congress checks

**[Golshan 5/27]{.underline}** \[Tara Golshan covers Congress,

\"Trump ignored Congress on war powers. Constitutional scholars want
Democrats to take him to court.\" Vox, 27 May 2019,
vox.com/2019/5/27/18634590/nancy-pelosi-donald-trump-supreme-court-war-power\]

A group of constitutional scholars and [[lawmakers
want]{.underline}]{.mark} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi [[to take
President]{.underline}]{.mark} Donald [[to the Supreme Court over the
war in Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Their case is straightforward: Trump is unilaterally involving the
United States in war, and that's unconstitutional. For four years, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has
participated in a war in Yemen that was never authorized by
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and that Congress expressly told Trump to
withdraw from. Trump ignored the directive. Now, as the White House
escalates tensions with Iran, there's growing concern that [[unless
legal action is taken, Congress will **cede more war** powers to
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In April, Congress passed a historic War Powers Resolution directing
Trump to remove troops involved in "hostilities" in Yemen. Trump vetoed
it, cementing American fingerprints on one of the worst humanitarian
crises in the world: According to the most recent United Nations report,
80 percent of the Yemeni population --- 24 million people --- is in need
of humanitarian assistance. The Senate failed to reach the 67-vote
threshold needed to override the executive veto on the bill.

Trump said the War Powers Resolution was an attempt to "weaken \[his\]
constitutional authorities." But [[the power to **authorize a
declaration** of war]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[sits with
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}, not the president.

Constitutional scholars are now arguing a War Powers Resolution isn't a
normal bill. They say it is a fundamental constitutional question about
the power to authorize war. And the stakes are high.

"The president's veto doesn't end this conversation," Bruce Ackerman, a
constitutional law scholar with Yale University, told Vox. He's one of a
diverse group of legal experts who have sent Pelosi a letter urging her
to take legal action.

The United States got involved in Yemen four years ago when Saudi Arabia
and its allies began a military campaign in Yemen against Iranian-backed
Houthi rebels. The [[US is providing Saudis with]{.mark}]{.underline}
intelligence, [[arms and ammunition]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, until
late last year, fuel for their warplanes. The warplanes that bombed a
school bus, killing at least 40 children last August, did so with an
American-made bomb.

The war has killed more than 50,000 people, according to one independent
estimate, and has left tens of millions more in need of assistance.
Trump is determined to keep course, and has shown he is committed to his
alliance with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, even after it
became clear the prince called for Saudi Washington Post journalist
Jamal Khashoggi's killing.

[[Since Trump's veto, his admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[has
escalated tensions with Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, spreading concern
that Trump is itching to stoke another war. These concerns were
exacerbated on Friday, when the administration sidestepped Congress
again, unilaterally authorizing \$8 billion in arms sales, including to
Saudi Arabia and its allies, to counter Iran.

"This is a moment of truth, both for the congressional war power and for
the Supreme Court of the United States," Ackerman said. "Does the
Supreme Court of the United States --- and its claim of originalism ---
is that supposed to be taken seriously?"

The case for taking Trump to the Supreme Court, briefly explained

Constitutionally, Congress has the power to declare war, and the
president, as the commander in chief, has the power to direct the
military after Congress's authorization. Historically, America's
war-making has gone differently; presidents have consistently pushed the
boundaries of their power.

For example, for the past 18 years, presidents of both parties have used
the same 2001 congressional war authorization, passed after 9/11, as
justification for going to war across the Middle East, including Yemen.
The Obama administration did not ask Congress for specific authorization
before involving itself in Yemen. The Trump administration hasn't
either, bypassing the legislative branch as it negotiated billions of
dollars in arms deals, and as it conducted military operations.

Instead of seeking congressional approval for war, [[presidents
have]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[turned to their internal legal
counsels to build a largely **secret** body of law]{.underline}]{.mark}
to defend their war engagements, Mary Dudziak, a constitutional scholar
with Emory University School of Law, said.

of war by Congress, congressional authorization for the use of military
force or a national emergency such as an attack on the U.S. or its armed
forces.

Himes\' [[Reclamation of War Powers Act would]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[repeal]{.underline}]{.mark} the two current congressional
authorizations; one from 20[[01]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[passed in the
wake of the Sept. 11]{.underline}]{.mark} attacks,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the other from 20[[02 that allowed the ground

in the years [[following 9-11]{.underline}]{.mark}, \"[[we have

more [[to the President to the point]{.underline}]{.mark} where, now,

where neither the executive or Congress is ultimately responsible. That
has to end,\" Himes said in a news release announcing the bill.

In a phone interview Monday morning, Himes said he has thought, for a
long time, that Congress \"should be reasserting its constitutional
authority.\"

\"This seems to be the moment because President-elect

Himes\' bill will likely face hurdles in the new Congress with an even
greater Republican majority. A similar bill, introduced by U.S. Rep.
Chris Gibson, a Republican and retired Army colonel who represents New
York\'s 19th District, failed to pass at least twice, most recently in
2013.

\"Since this is going to be regarded as a hindrance to Donald Trump, my
guess is my Republican friends are going to be a little shy about it,\"
Himes said.

That may change if they see a lot more \"erratic behavior\" from him, he
added.

Given that the current legislative session ends Friday, Himes said he
was introducing the bill Monday and then will work to find cosponsors
and garner support for it once the new session starts.

Since the administration of George Washington,
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and the president [[have
only]{.underline}]{.mark} officially [[declared war **11**
times]{.underline}]{.mark}, and since the administration of John Adams
they have authorized the use of force just 12 times, according to a 2014
report from the Congressional Research Service.

Himes\' bill would require the president, when requesting a declaration
of war or congressional authorization, to issue a report \"outlining the
threat faced, the objectives and justifications of the conflict and a
description of the anticipated scope and duration of the action.\"

[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}ional approval [[sends a **strong
message** to the rest of the world]{.underline}]{.mark}, Himes said,
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[[we\'ve had a robust
discussion]{.underline}]{.mark} amongst the people\'s representatives
and support it.\"

\"It sends a signal that didn\'t exist when President (Barack) Obama
unilaterally went into Libya,\" he added.

A resolution, led by the Obama administration and passed by the United
Nations Security Council in March 2011, authorized military intervention
in Libya. Obama said at the time that the goal was to protect the people
there from the Moammar Gaddafi regime, but later said failing to prepare
for the aftermath of ousting the Libyan dictator was the worst mistake
of his presidency.

The Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice issued a
memo saying that Obama \"had the constitutional authority to direct the
use of military force in Libya because he could reasonably determine
that such use of force was in the national interest.\"

\"Prior congressional approval was not constitutionally required to use
military force in the limited operations under consideration,\" the memo
says.

[[The president is required, under the W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct, in \"every

#### Congress reclaiming War Powers stops misuse of AUMF -- checks Trump

**[Farrar 7/12]{.underline}** \[Douglas Farrar was a policy adviser to
two members of Congress, including a senior member of the House
Appropriations Committee. He is now the director of public affairs at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "Congress must reclaim
its war-making powers." *The Hill*, 12 July 2019,
thehill.com/opinion/national-security/452511-congress-must-reclaim-its-war-making-powers\]

[[Three]{.underline}]{.mark} consecutive [[presidents have taken
military action under]{.underline}]{.mark} the increasingly dubious
legal [[auspices of the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2001
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}uthorization of the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}se
of [[M]{.underline}]{.mark}ilitary [[F]{.underline}]{.mark}orce passed
by Congress following the September 11 attacks. Now, as the House
contemplates the future of this legislation, lawmakers of both [[parties
must consider]{.underline}]{.mark} not only what powers Congress has
given President Trump to pursue a foolhardy war with Iran, but [[whether
or not they ought to **reclaim**]{.underline}]{.mark} this most sacred
of [[democratic]{.underline}]{.mark} government's
[[duties]{.underline}]{.mark}: the decision to commit American soldiers
to fight and die abroad.

The 2001 AUMF was designed to allow then-President George W. Bush
latitude to pursue al Qaeda across the world after its deadly assault on
the U.S. homeland. But since then, the [[AUMF has been cited as the
legal justification for American military intervention
in]{.underline}]{.mark} at least seven [[places]{.underline}]{.mark},
several of [[which have little or very tenuous al Qaeda
ties]{.underline}]{.mark}. It appears this administration is preparing
to make the argument that it allows them to initiate military action
against Iran.

The current AUMF is a symptom of a larger problem, which is that [[the
White House has too much power]{.underline}]{.mark} to initiate and
sustain military conflict [[without congressional
review]{.underline}]{.mark}. The root problem here is politics. While
there is a core bipartisan group of lawmakers committed to ending this
AUMF and triggering the need for a new one for any sustained military
engagement, [[the politics of voting on war]{.underline}]{.mark} in
general [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly always
**[[bad]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Just ask Hillary Clinton, whose Iraq war
vote sank her presidential candidacy in 2008, or Joe Biden, who faced
criticism on the debate stage recently for that same vote over a decade
later.

Take the escalating tensions with Iran, for example. [[Bipartisan
majorities of voters oppose military engagement with
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}. But in Congress, the Democratic House passed
a repeal of the AUMF on a mostly party-line vote in their version of the
defense funding bill, while in the Senate,
[[Dem]{.underline}]{.mark}ocrat[[s were unable to convince enough
Rep]{.underline}]{.mark}ublican[[s to add provisions
to]{.underline}]{.mark} that chamber's [[N]{.underline}]{.mark}ational
[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}uthorization
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct [[that limited]{.underline}]{.mark} President
[[Trump's ability to wage war]{.underline}]{.mark} with Iran.
Partisanship and politics trumped voter preferences. This week the
Congress once against debated AUMF policy, at least in the House, thanks
to Rep. Barbara Lee's (D-Calif.) amendment to the House version of the
National Defense Authorization Act.

This measure is particularly important now, as [[tensions with Iran run
the risk of sparking yet **another war** in the Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a closed-door briefing last month, members
of [[Congress expressed concern that the]{.mark}
[admin]{.mark}]{.underline}istration [[might wrongly invoke the
authorization for the use of military force]{.underline}]{.mark},
approved after September 11, [[to go to war with
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}. Testifying to the House Foreign Affairs
Committee on Wednesday, the administration\'s point man on Iran, Brian
Hook, dodged the question, stating only that it would \"comply with the
law\" in deciding whether to take military action against Iran. But
Secretary of State Mike [[Pompeo\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} dubious
[[claims of a]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [[relationship between
Iran and al Qaeda]{.mark} [suggest that the
admin]{.mark}]{.underline}istration [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} at least
[[considering using the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2001 [[AUMF to justify a
war]{.mark} with Iran.]{.underline}

Thankfully, last week, Trump pulled back from the brink and decided not
to bomb Iran in response to Tehran\'s shooting down of an US
surveillance drone. As Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group has
noted, if a military action against Iran were to escalate to a
full-scale war, it would \"make the Afghan and Iraqi conflicts look like
a walk in the park.\" It could also cost hundreds of billions of
dollars.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} House [[action to restrict the President\'s
war powers is **long overdue**]{.underline}]{.mark}, given the high
price of our post-9/11 wars. According to Brown University\'s Costs of
War Project, the US wars of this century will cost over \$5.9 trillion
once obligations for lifelong care of the veterans of these conflicts
are taken into account. These financial costs, immense as they are,
can\'t begin to express the human consequences of these conflicts, which
have left over 4,423 US troops dead and 31,597 wounded, and hundreds of
thousands more with traumatic brain injuries or Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD). And by a conservative estimate, more than 480,000
people have died on all sides of these wars. Meanwhile, [[the number of
terrorist groups operating around the world has
**multiplied**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

There is growing evidence that the [[American public is tired of our
**forever wars**]{.underline}]{.mark}. An October 2018 survey by the
Charles Koch Institute found that only 21% of Americans feel that the
United States has a \"clear strategic objective\" in Afghanistan, and a
Pew poll from November of that year indicated that only about
[[one-third of voters think hunting down terrorists in other countries
should be a priority]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Veterans]{.underline}]{.mark} organizations such as VoteVets and
Concerned Veterans of America, which occupy opposite ends of the
political spectrum, [[have joined]{.mark}]{.underline} forces
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} press for a withdrawal of US troops from
Afghanistan and a [[repeal]{.underline}]{.mark} of the overly permissive
2001 [[AUMF]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the House has just voted to do.

The mood in [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} with regard to [[war
powers]{.underline}]{.mark} has been shifting over the past few years,
as evidenced by the historic passage in both houses of bills that
[[would have ended US support for the]{.underline}]{.mark} brutal
Saudi-led [[**war in Yemen** under the W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esolution.
Although [[Trump ended up vetoing the resolution]{.underline}]{.mark},
it remains a testament to growing congressional opposition to
counterproductive unauthorized wars.

The bipartisan nature of this opposition was underscored in an April 4
letter to the President, urging him not to veto the resolution. It was
signed by a group of members that included Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna,
Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, along
with Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul. The letter called for an
end to the unconstitutional US role in Yemen as a way to \"set a new
precedent for cooperation with both chambers of Congress\" on issues of
war and peace.

Since then, Republican Rep. Andy Biggs and Democratic Rep. Khanna have
started a new War Powers Caucus which, in the words of Khanna, is
designed to lead the way to \"re-establish congressional war-making
power, military restraint, and \[remove\] the U.S. from endless wars as
the pillars of our foreign policy.\"

Despite his veto of the Yemen legislation and his failure to end any of
the wars he inherited, even [[Trump has]{.underline}]{.mark}, on
occasion, [[acknowledged that the era of **perpetual war** needs to come
to an end]{.underline}]{.mark}. During his campaign for President, he
routinely referred to the Iraq War as a \"disaster,\" and he has noted
that the [[trillions spent on]{.mark} our Mideast [wars could have
gone]{.mark} a long way [in rebuilding America]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
this year\'s State of the Union address, Trump stated flatly, \"Great
nations do not fight endless wars.\"

[[Strong action by Congress will help tip the balance away
from]{.underline}]{.mark} a policy of ever [[more
war]{.underline}]{.mark} and toward one grounded in diplomacy and
economic cooperation \-- with force reserved as an instrument of last
resort when there is a serious threat to the United States that can\'t
be resolved through other means. Never again should the United States go
to war without the authorization of Congress.

[[The next step is for the Senate to take action to repeal
the]{.underline}]{.mark} 2001 [[AUMF]{.underline}]{.mark} and for Trump
to sign it into law. America will be stronger and better for it.

#### The President previously illegally authorized attacks on countries -- the CP reasserts Congressional authority to declare war

Congressional critics of our endless wars have been repeatedly stymied
by leadership on both sides of the aisle from engaging in a real debate
and vote. That could be changing, however. [[Recent resolutions to end
US military support for the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen War appear
to be a **Congressional reassertion** of that
authority]{.underline}]{.mark}. Still, it's one step forward, two steps
back: some of the language offered in those resolutions, as written,
could legitimize and strengthen the executive branch's broad assertions
of its powers to wage war without congressional approval.

Last year, the Senate invoked the War Powers Resolution---the first time
it had done so since Congress had passed the War Powers Resolution in
1973---to formalize its disapproval of the executive branch's use of the
US military in the Yemen War. The White House threatened to veto the
resolution, and the House was unable to consider the resolution after
Republican House leadership attached a provision to a procedural vote on
the 2018 farm bill to prohibit considering any war powers resolutions
for the rest of the year.

The House and the Senate introduced new resolutions last month that pick
up where last year's fight left off. They both offer stronger language
than what the Senate passed last year, but should still be refined
further to prevent continued efforts by the executive branch to conduct
illegal wars in Americans' names.

Part of the important context to understand is that [[when Congress
gives the executive branch an inch on these powers, the executive branch
takes **miles and miles**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2001 Congress
authorized the President "to use all necessary and appropriate force
against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned,
authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on
September 11, 2001." Since then, each president has read that
authorization as broadly as necessary to allow the use of force. [[The
C]{.underline}]{.mark}ongressional [[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esearch
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ervice [[found the executive branch has used
that authority to deploy our troops to Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Georgia, Kenya, and Somalia]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[none of which had
anything to do with the attacks on our country in
2001]{.underline}]{.mark}. Representatives from both sides of the aisle
became concerned enough about these abuses that the House Appropriations
Committee supported a measure offered in 2017 by Representative Barbara
Lee (D-CA) to repeal the 2001 authorization. House leadership prevented
a vote on that through a procedure that stripped the repeal language
before the bill was considered on the Floor.

The current war powers debate often misses how [[Congress has repeatedly
allowed the executive branch to improperly infringe upon its
authority]{.underline}]{.mark}. Congress allowed President Truman to set
a troubling precedent that subsequent presidents have used to continue
to improperly expand their war powers.

[[The expansion of our wars has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[been
furthered by executive branch interpretations of "associated
forces"]{.underline}]{.mark}---a phrase that was not part of the 2001
authorization. The executive branch has argued that by continuing to
provide money "through an unbroken stream of appropriations over
multiple years," Congress has tacitly given its approval for those
operations. Congressional Research Service analysts wrote that
Congressional challenges to hostilities absent authorization were
unsuccessful "in large part because Congress continued to appropriate
money for military operations."

If [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} wants to stop the executive branch's
broad reading, they [[need to push back more
**forcefully**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Yemen resolution passed by the
Senate included a number of loopholes that would allow support to
continue. The resolution prohibits the use of American troops or
resources in "hostilities," but it does not explicitly prohibit the
indirect assistance the U.S. has provided, such as supplying bombs,
aerial targeting assistance, or intelligence sharing. Problems with this
ambiguity were raised by Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), then the chair of
the Senate Foreign Relations committee. The White House made clear that
without additional detail about how hostilities was being defined, it
would not interpret the United States' role as "hostilities."

The new resolutions clarify that in-flight refueling of non-US aircraft
conducting missions is prohibited, but do not prohibit the United States
providing bombs or sharing intelligence. If Congress truly wants to stop
U.S. involvement in Yemen, it needs to clarify that providing any
assistance is prohibited.

Given the Administration's past interpretation of Congressional intent,
future votes limiting actions in Yemen---and not voting on proposals to
revise or repeal the underlying war authorization language---leave the
door wide open to further claims of Congressional acquiescence to the
Administration's broad readings everywhere, including keeping troops in
Iraq to check Iran.

Nixon vetoed the War Powers Resolution, but Congress overrode the veto.
Subsequent Presidents have sought to shield the power of the executive
branch by resisting Congress's attempts to assert itself in this arena.
[President Trump is likely to veto any legislative effort to restrict
his actions in this arena as well]{.underline}, so it is understandable
that the resolutions include some ambiguities to garner a veto-proof
majority of votes necessary for a significant reassertion of
congressional authority. Unfortunately, [those ambiguities may undermine
further efforts of this Congress and future ones to challenge endless
war]{.underline}.

Congress's war powers under the Constitution are clear: it is
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}, not the executive branch, that [[has
the power to declare war]{.underline}]{.mark}. While [[the
W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers
[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esolution passed in 1973 [[was seen as Congress
attempting to **reassert** those powers]{.underline}]{.mark}, Congress
has otherwise allowed its authority in national security to continue to
diminish. "The net result was to legalize a scope for independent
presidential power that would have astonished the Framers, who vested
the power to initiate hostilities exclusively in Congress," Lou Fisher
(co-author of this piece) and former Idaho State University professor
David Gray Adler wrote in a 1998 article. As a consequence, the War
Powers Resolution "grants to the president unbridled discretion to go to
war as he deems necessary against anyone, anytime, anywhere, for at
least ninety days. As Arthur Schlesinger Jr. has observed, before 'the
passage of the resolution, unilateral presidential war was a matter of
usurpation. Now, at least for the first ninety days, it was a matter of
law.'" Fisher and Adler wrote.

Some of the challenges of ending wars came up in the Constitutional
Convention, the Congressional Research Service observed in a 2008
report:

Although the U.S. Constitution expressly empowers Congress to declare
war, it is notably silent regarding which political body is responsible
for returning the United States to a state of peace. Some evidence
suggests that [[this omission was not accidental]{.underline}]{.mark}.
During the Constitutional Convention, a motion was made by one of the
delegates to modify the draft document by adding the words 'and peace'
after the words 'to declare war.' This motion, however, was unanimously
rejected. Convention records do not clearly evidence the framers' intent
in rejecting the motion. (internal citations omitted)

So what options are available to Congress that are realistic in this
scenario? One is to legislate what they mean when it comes to the Yemen
War: Congress never authorized direct or indirect support of the Saudi
government's bombings, and will not allow the United States to provide
direct or indirect support. In the House, the chair of the Foreign
Affairs Committee, Representative Eliot Engel (D-NY), is a cosponsor of
the House Yemen resolution and has expressed interest in reevaluating
the executive branch's interpretation of previous war authorizations.
Alternatively, Congress could use the appropriations process to prohibit
funding for direct or indirect support.

These options require more political courage than we've seen Congress
demonstrate in regard to military policy for decades, but the direct
approach is not only advisable but [[essential for restoring Congress's
war powers and **protecting** our constitutional
system]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### 2NC -- AT: Pompeo Circumvention

#### Only taking power away from the executive branch can end the ongoing war

In the past few years alone, the U.S. has launched military strikes in
Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and Iraq---all in the name of fighting al-Qaeda
and its later offshoot, the Islamic State. For the most part, Congress
has accepted this. But as [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}-administration
officials [[talk]{.mark} ever tougher [about Iran]{.mark}]{.underline},
many Capitol Hill Democrats, [[and some]{.underline}]{.mark}
Republicans, [[fear that the confrontation could **spin out of control**
into a **devastating conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And now they're
trying to claw back some of the power that the president---whom they
view as dangerous and reckless---has to declare war.

Administration officials such as Mike Pompeo have made the rounds to
argue for the connection between Iran and al-Qaeda. The president
declares he wants to negotiate with the Iranians in one breath and
threatens consequences the likes of which no one has ever seen in the
next. This worries Democrats such as Representative Jason Crow of
Colorado, a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I
learned firsthand," he said recently, "that [[when politicians talk
tough]{.underline}]{.mark} in this town, [[**real** people get
hurt]{.underline}]{.mark}."

He's one of 87 co-sponsors of a bipartisan amendment to the House
defense budget that would prohibit Donald Trump from launching a war
with Iran without congressional authorization. Elissa Slotkin, a
freshman Democratic House member from Michigan who served in Iraq with
the CIA, is another. When she heard Pompeo talking about al-Qaeda and
Iran this summer, she said Saturday at the Aspen Security Forum, "my
ears pricked up." [[It sounded]{.underline}]{.mark} to her [[as if
Pompeo was trying to create space to **go to war** with
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and argue that]{.underline}]{.mark} the
administration [[could legally do so under the 2001
law]{.underline}]{.mark} that authorized military force against al-Qaeda
and its associated forces.

No one who voted for that law after the September 11, 2001, attacks
would have envisioned its use against the Islamic Republic of Iran, she
said. Her colleague Mac Thornberry, the ranking Republican on the House
Armed Services Committee who voted for the authorization, said at the
same event that he certainly didn't envision all the battles the law is
currently being used for---including the fight against ISIS and other
counterterrorism missions all over the world.

But this is also why it has proved so hard to change, despite seemingly
bipartisan agreement that it needs an update. [[The law
authorizes]{.mark}]{.underline} virtually [[all]{.underline}]{.mark} of
America's [[counterterrorism work overseas]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[if it simply goes away without being revised, those missions are
arguably illegal]{.underline}]{.mark}. But, Slotkin said, there are wide
disagreements on what, if anything, should replace it. Some members
don't want to authorize anything. Some members want to build in
restrictions other members find unacceptable. Some want to keep things
exactly the same. "We've got 50,000 forces in the Persian Gulf right
now," Slotkin said. "If we took away the authorization of military
force---every authorization---right now, what would we do? Would we pull
them all back by the letter of the law? We'd have to examine that."

The debate isn't just about an 18-year-old law; it involves much bigger
questions about constitutional powers, and war and peace. These are
questions members of Congress acknowledge, but have so far declined to
really answer with a debate and a vote. Thornberry himself posed some of
them: "When is it war that Congress has to approve? When is it
self-defense?" Would Congress have to authorize U.S.-military escorts
for tankers through the Strait of Hormuz? What about shooting down
another country's drone? What about cyberattacks?

In the meantime, Slotkin said, she and her co-sponsors felt it necessary
to at least lay down a marker that Congress wants to exercise oversight.

But despite suspicions that Pompeo is trying to build the case to use
the 2001 authorization against Iran, it's not clear the administration
would even go that route. Pompeo and his Iran adviser Brian Hook have
dodged questions about this in open congressional hearings, saying only
that whatever action they took with Iran would be under their legal
authority. But Mark Esper, Trump's nominee to be secretary of defense,
said at his confirmation hearing that [[the 2001]{.mark} [authorization
would not apply to Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, he said, [[the
president had the authority under Article II of the Constitution as
commander in chief]{.underline}]{.mark}. "I don't think there's a
serious attempt to use \[the 2001 authorization\] for that purpose,"
Thornberry said Saturday. "I don't think anyone would support it."

The amendment Slotkin co-sponsored would not prevent a strike on Iran in
self-defense, which is the likeliest justification Trump would claim for
a strike if he did order one. When National Security Adviser John Bolton
announced in May that the U.S. was sending a carrier strike group to the
region in response to intelligence about Iranian threats, he warned of
"unrelenting force"---but in the event "of any attack on United States
interests or those of our allies."

A similar measure failed in the Republican-dominated Senate. The
Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut expressed disgust at what he called
Congress's abdication of responsibility to declare war in numerous
theaters where the United States has recently entered into armed
hostilities---in Libya in 2011, and against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in
2014. "We have given up on authorizing military force largely because
it's a lot harder than it used to be," he said at an earlier event at
Aspen. "We don't have armies marching against each other; we don't have
peace treaties that wrap up hostilities. It's harder to define your
enemies. It's much harder to define what victory looks like. And we just
stopped doing it."

Murphy noted that Barack Obama was widely seen as weak for failing to
strike Syria after President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons
against civilians in 2013, stepping over a "red line" the president had
set the year before. Instead, Obama went to Congress, which did not
authorize such a strike, and Obama backed off. Murphy said he was right
to do so. "[[Because you can't get authorization is **not an excuse** to
violate the Constitution]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said.

Congress did pass the [[W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esolution, to be
sure. But if anything, the Resolution --- sympathetic mythology to the
contrary notwithstanding --- [[actually **emboldened** the president and
**codified** executive warmaking powers]{.underline}]{.mark} that would
have astonished the framers of the Constitution.

I have explained the intentions of the framers with regard to war powers
here. Suffice it to say that the framers resolutely opposed placing
offensive war powers in the hands of the president, and deliberately
assigned such authority to the legislative branch.

[[The W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers
[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esolution [[does not restore the
**proper**]{.mark}]{.underline} constitutional [[**balance** between
president and Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} in matters of war. Consider
first the resolution's provision that the president may commit troops to
offensive operations anywhere in the world he chooses and for any reason
without the consent of Congress, for a period of 60 days (though he must
at least inform them of his action within 48 hours). After the initial
60 days he must secure congressional authorization for the action to
continue. He then has another 30 days to withdraw the troops if such
authorization is not forthcoming.

Until the War Powers Resolution, no constitutional or statutory
authority could be cited on behalf of such behavior on the part of the
president. Now it became fixed law, despite violating the letter and the
spirit of the Constitution.

It so happens, moreover, that [[thanks to a loophole in the resolution,
the 60-day clock begins only if and when the president reports to
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} under Section 4(a)(1) of the Resolution.
Surprise, surprise: [[presidents have therefore reported to Congress in
a more generic manner rather than expressly under that
section]{.underline}]{.mark}. They issue reports \"consistent with\"
rather than \"pursuant to\" the Resolution.

Even still, in a few cases presidents have acted as if the 60-day limit
were in effect, perhaps out of political considerations (even if from a
strictly legal point of view it was not). But Bill
[[Clinton's]{.underline}]{.mark} multi-year military [[intervention in
Bosnia]{.mark}]{.underline} alone, without even so much as a nod in the
direction of Congress, [[made perfectly clear that the
resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}, whatever good points may be buried
within it, [[was effectively a **dead letter**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Resolution calls for \"consultation\" by the President with Congress
before committing troops to combat. This consultation, we are told, is
to occur \"in every possible instance.\" (Who could possibly find a
loophole there?) In practice, presidents have interpreted this provision
to mean that they must notify Congress following the initiation of
hostilities --- not exactly what its drafters probably had in mind.

Ever since the passage of the Resolution, opponents of presidential
actions have sometimes followed a strategy of appealing to the courts
for redress, waving the War Powers Resolution before federal judges. For
a variety of reasons, these judges have hesitated to intervene in such
cases. Louis Fisher and David Gray Adler1, two experts on presidential
war powers, have therefore suggested that the [[W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esolution [[has
diverted opponents of presidential wars into fruitless judicial
challenges instead of simply declaring that the president's action was
unconstitutional and refusing to fund it]{.underline}]{.mark}.

On Wednesday, 10 House members filed a lawsuit designed to block the
Obama administration from further participation in the war. Along with
numerous other members of Congress, including Republican House Speaker
John Boehner of Ohio, they say [[Obama is in violation of the War Powers
Act]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[1973 law was meant to prevent presidents from sustaining wars
without congressional approval]{.underline}]{.mark}. But no one thinks
the lawsuit will succeed. And [[the W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct [[has **never**
been successfully employed to **end any military
mission**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\"[The War Powers resolution really does not work]{.underline},\" says
former Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-IN), who co-chaired the Iraq Study Group and
the 9/11 Commission.

Instead, [[the W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct has largely been used as it\'s being used now
--- [[as a political tool that allows Congress to criticize a
president]{.underline}]{.mark} about the prosecution of a war.

\"The rhetoric is sadly familiar,\" says Gordon Adams, a foreign policy
professor at American University. \"It just flips by party, depending on
who\'s deploying the troops.\"

No More Vietnams

The law was passed over the veto of President Richard M. Nixon. The
intention was to prevent America from entering into protracted military
engagements, as Vietnam had become, without the approval of Congress.

The president has 60 days to seek formal approval from Congress after
engaging in hostilities, with the possibility of a 30-day extension.
\"When the United States makes a decision to go to war, it ought not to
be made by one person,\" says Hamilton, who was chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee from 1993 to 1995.

Rarely Declaring War

But, as Hamilton notes, [[no president has accepted the
**constitutionality** of the W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct, [[viewing it
as a **violation** of the separation of powers]{.mark}]{.underline} and
the president\'s authority as commander in chief.

In 2000, the Supreme Court turned back a challenge brought by a group of
31 members of Congress who complained that U.S. participation in a
bombing campaign in Yugoslavia violated the act.

\"There\'s a long pattern of members going to court on War Powers
cases,\" says Louis Fisher, a constitutional scholar who retired last
year after 40 years as an adviser to Congress.

\"Ninety-five percent of the time, courts say, \'Thirty of you are
saying the president violated the law, 30 others in an amicus brief are
saying he didn\'t. We\'re not going to get involved,\' \" Fisher says.

A Political Cudgel

As a result, the debate over violations of the War Powers Act has
devolved into a distraction. Hamilton says the law\'s intent was valid
and that \"Congress ought to hold the administration\'s feet to the fire
with regard to Libya.\"

But he argues that the [[1973 law has become a]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"political [[tool that allows]{.mark}]{.underline} members of
[[Congress to dodge taking a position on the intervention
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. As is often the case, they argue the
process rather than the substance.\"

Both the Republican and Democratic congressional caucuses are divided
about Libya. Some would prefer a more concerted effort to target Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, while others worry about an expansion of the
mission from protecting civilians to seeking regime change.

As a result, it\'s difficult for Congress to speak with one voice in its
battle with Obama. On June 3, the House approved a resolution
criticizing the president for not providing a \"compelling rationale\"
for the Libya campaign, but turned back legislation that would have
pulled out U.S. forces within 15 days.

Party Vs. Principle

Both Hamilton and Adams say the War Powers Act is being used primarily
as a political cudgel against Obama.

\"Is the War Powers Act about protecting the power of Congress relative
to the president, or about the two political parties?\" asks Noah
Feldman, a professor of international law at Harvard University.

[[Everyone in Congress wants to]{.mark} protect Congress, but they also
want to [protect the president of their party]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While some members of Congress may use the law to criticize the
president for political reasons, others will defend a president of their
own party --- even those who had invoked the War Powers Act the last
time the other party held the White House.

\"It doesn\'t matter if you\'re \[George W.\] Bush or Obama, you want
more power in the White House,\" Feldman says. \"Everyone in Congress
wants to protect Congress, but they also want to protect the president
of their party.\"

Power Of The Purse

As a result, [[Congress never manages to speak with one
voice]{.underline}]{.mark} and insist en masse to the courts [[that a
president is in violation of the W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct.

Congress can ultimately express its displeasure about a war by cutting
off funds. But with the defense budget so large, the Libyan effort is
being handled out of petty cash. A White House report Wednesday said the
campaign had cost \$715 million so far, with the total rising to \$1.1
billion by early September.

\"They\'re taking the money out of operating costs,\" Feldman says.
\"Because we have wars going on elsewhere, [[Congress isn\'t going to
**take away** funds for troops]{.underline}]{.mark} elsewhere, so when
the administration comes back and says we need to make up the funds for
Afghanistan and Iraq, it\'s going to be hard for Congress to say no.\"

Not Really A War?

Faced with warnings about the 90-day deadline under the War Powers Act
expiring Friday, the Obama administration sent Congress a report
Wednesday arguing that the law does not apply because U.S. military
operations in Libya are \"distinct from the kind of \'hostilities\'
contemplated by the resolution\'s 60-day term.\"

The administration\'s argument is that NATO is in charge and there
aren\'t any U.S. ground troops in Libya, so therefore the U.S. is not at
war in the sense covered by the law. \"We are in no way putting into
question the constitutionality of the War Powers resolution,\" Ben
Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said Wednesday in a
conference call with reporters.

This is the sort of response that administrations typically reach for in
trying to avoid a direct challenge to the law, while also avoiding
adhering too faithfully to its requirements, says Glenn Antizzo, a
political scientist at Mississippi College.

\"One trick that presidents try, on both sides of the aisle, is to
adhere to aspects of the War Powers Act without actually saying you\'re
invoking the War Powers Act.\"

The dance both sides are doing does little to clarify exactly what
deference the executive branch owes to Congress in military matters.

\"Again and again, [[you try to find some]{.underline}]{.mark} credible
[[way to]{.underline}]{.mark} at least [[request]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[the executive branch honor]{.underline}]{.mark}s the
[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct,\" says Anthony Cordesman, a former Senate
aide who is now a national security analyst at the Center for Strategic
& International Studies. \"Again and again, [[you back away and **weaken
Congress**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

[[After]{.underline}]{.mark} the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon
[[Administrations]{.underline}]{.mark} spent nearly a decade
[[committing U.S. troops to Southeast Asia without Congressional
approval]{.underline}]{.mark}, in 1973 [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}
responded by [[pass]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[the
W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers
[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esolution. [The Resolution sought to halt the
erosion of Congress\'s ability to participate in war-making decisions,
an aim furthered by the Resolution\'s requirement that the President
communicate to Congress the commitment of troops within 48
hours]{.underline}. Further, the statute requires the President to
remove all troops after 60 days if Congress has not granted an
extension.

[[Presidents]{.underline}]{.mark} have typically
[[consider]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[the W]{.underline}]{.mark}ar
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}owers [[R]{.underline}]{.mark}esolution [[to be
unconstitutional]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[so they have tended not to
follow it]{.underline}]{.mark}. This unwillingness has never been
challenged by another actor (congress, civilians, etc), so [[the Supreme
Court has **never up** the issue]{.underline}]{.mark}. In one way, [[the
resolution takes]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[unprecedented action by
allowing the President to unilaterally put American troops into
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although the act imposes a check on the
President (by imposing a limit for the amount of time the troops can be
deployed without Congressional consent), [[the act has not appeared to
pose any practical checks on Presidential actions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And even though the War Powers Act exists, [[Congress is still largely
deferential toward the President with regard to military
authorization]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example in 1995, regarding the
sending of US troops into Bosnia, Bob Dole (the Republican Senate
Majority Leader) said that [[President]{.underline}]{.mark} Clinton (a
Democrat) [[had "the authority and the power under the Constitution to
do what he feels should be done regardless of what Congress
does]{.underline}]{.mark}."

and the Constitutional Text." *University of Chicago Law Review*, Vol.
69, No. 4, Fall 2002, dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.426862\]

In a series of articles, I have criticized the view that the original
understanding of the Constitution requires that Congress provide its
authorization before the United States can engage in military
hostilities.1 This "[[pro-Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[position
ignores the constitutional text]{.mark} and structure, [errs in
interpreting the ratification]{.mark} history [of the
Constitution]{.mark}, [and cannot account for the practice of the
**three branches of government**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead of the
rigid process advocated by scholars such as Louis Henkin, John Hart Ely,
Louis Fisher, Michael Glennon, and Harold Koh,2 I have argued that the
[[Constitution creates a **flexible system** of war
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[That system provides the
president]{.mark} with significant initiative [as
commander-in-chief]{.mark}, [while reserving to Congress]{.mark} ample
[authority to check executive policy]{.mark} through its power of the
purse]{.underline}. In this scheme, the Declare War Clause confers on
Congress a juridical power, one that both defines the state of
international legal relations between the United States and another
country and triggers domestic constitutional authorities during
wartime.3

In Textualism and War Powers, 4 Professor Michael D. Ramsey agrees with
much of my work and does me the honor of recognizing me as a leading
proponent of a pro-executive theory of war powers. He agrees that
[[pro-Congress scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} have not advanced a
convincing textual defense of their views, and that they [[have been
**unable to explain the historical evidence** that favors presidential
control]{.mark} over the initiation of military
hostilities]{.underline}. He admits that pro-Congress scholars have
failed to reply to my criticism of their historical arguments. Professor
Ramsey even concedes that by the eighteenth century, formal declarations
of war were unnecessary to authorize the conduct of military
hostilities. Professor Ramsey acknowledges that the [[pro-Congress
position]{.mark} [suffers from a]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[serious
textual embarrassment]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [[because the
constitutional text only grants Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[the
power]{.underline}]{.mark} '[[to declare war]{.underline}]{.mark},'
[[not the power]{.underline}]{.mark} '[[to authorize
hostilities]{.underline}]{.mark},' and it is not immediately clear why
the two should be equated."5

[[Senators]{.underline}]{.mark} are ready to pack their bags and head
out of town before the hot, swampy weather in Washington gets any more
unbearable. But of course, not before they [[humiliate themselves and
let down]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[constituents]{.underline}]{.mark}
one last time --- [[by **voting down** an amendment that would have
prevented an]{.mark} [**unauthorized** and **unconstitutional** war with
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}, as they did on Friday.

The bipartisan amendment, sponsored by Sens. Tom Udall, Tim Kaine, Rand
Paul, and Mike Lee, was short, sweet, and appropriate at a time when
[[the U.S. and Iran seem **minutes away** from a direct
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. The language was as clear as day: "no
funds authorized by this Act may be used to conduct hostilities against
the Government of Iran, against the Armed Forces of Iran, or in the
territory of Iran."

Under this amendment, if President Trump (or any future president)
thought military action was a necessity to defend the interests of the
United States, he would first need to do what the Constitution clearly
requires: make his case to Congress and attain authorization from our
elected representatives. Lest there was any worry about the amendment
tying the president's hands in extraordinary circumstances, it allowed
Trump to respond militarily if U.S. forces were attacked.

[[Republican senators]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell, Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe, and Marco
Rubio [[argued]{.underline}]{.mark} before the vote that [[the amendment
was dangerous]{.mark}, unnecessary, and counterproductive]{.underline}.
Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who would have probably invaded Iran already if
he were sitting in the Oval Office, made the ludicrous claim that
[[reaffirming Congress' war powers]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[embodies
**irresolution** & **weakness**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

But if there is any weakness here, it's on the shoulders of those who
voted down the measure and are apparently perfectly fine with bestowing
the president with monarchical war powers. George Washington, John
Adams, James Madison, and the rest of the founding fathers obviously
felt much differently, understanding that taking a country to war is a
decision far too important for one man to make.

And there was nothing in the Udall-Kaine amendment that was
unconstitutional or unreasonable. Indeed, [the language was in keeping
with what Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution]{.underline}
already states in black-and-white --- that it is the legislative branch,
not the executive, that determines when the country goes to war. And of
course [[if the U.S. is attacked, the president reserves the right to
strike back in self-defense without]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[coming
to Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Paradoxically, [[what the Senate did]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[was
vote **against** the declare war clause]{.underline}]{.mark}, the most
important provision in the country's most important document. [[While
the executive branch finds]{.underline}]{.mark} ever more clever [[ways
to expand its power]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[senators chose to **negate
their own** rather than fight to preserve it]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
for that, they should be ashamed.

Built in Saudi Arabia." *New York Times*, 7 June 2019,

WASHINGTON --- [[When]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration declared an emergency last
month and [[fast-tracked the sale of]{.underline}]{.mark} more [American
[arms to Saudi]{.mark}]{.underline} Arabia, [[it]{.underline}]{.mark}
did more than [[anger members of Congress who opposed the sale
on]{.mark} **[humanitarian grounds]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

It also raised concerns that the [[Saudis could gain access to
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[that would let them **produce their
own** versions of American precision-guided bombs]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- weapons they have used in strikes on civilians since they began
fighting a war in Yemen four years ago.

[[The emergency authorization allows Raytheon]{.underline}]{.mark}
Company, a top American defense firm, [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} team
with the Saudis to [[build high-tech bomb parts in Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}. That provision, which has not been
previously reported, is part of a broad package of information the
administration released this week to Congress.

The move grants Raytheon and the Saudis sweeping permission to begin
assembling the control systems, guidance electronics and circuit cards
that are essential to the company's Paveway smart bombs. The United
States has closely guarded such technology for national security
reasons.

Multiple reports by human rights groups over the past four years have
singled out the weapons as being used in airstrikes on civilians. One
attack, on a Sana funeral home in October 2016, led the Obama
administration to suspend bomb sales to the Saudi-led coalition in
Yemen.

The new arrangement is part of a larger arms package, previously blocked
by Congress, that includes 120,000 precision-guided bombs that Raytheon
is prepared to ship to the coalition. These will add to the tens of
thousands of bombs that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have
already stockpiled, and some in [[Congress fear the surplus would let
the countries continue fighting in Yemen long **into the
future**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The move also includes support for Saudi
F-15 warplanes, mortars, anti-tank missiles and .50-caliber rifles.

The emergency declaration, invoked in part because of tensions with
Iran, prompted a broad bipartisan pushback from lawmakers who were
concerned not only about the war, but also about whether the Trump
administration was usurping congressional authority to approve arms
sales.

A group of senators that includes Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina
Republican, Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, and Robert Menendez, the
New Jersey Democrat, announced on Wednesday that they would introduce 22
separate measures expressing disapproval of the deals.

"Few nations should be trusted less than Saudi Arabia," Mr. Paul said in
a statement on Thursday. "[[In recent years, they have **fomented**
human **atrocities**, repeatedly lied to the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and have proved to be a reckless regional
pariah. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} concerning and [[**irresponsible**
for the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to
continue providing them arms]{.underline}]{.mark}."

In the House, the Foreign Affairs Committee has scheduled a hearing for
next week in which members plan to question R. Clarke Cooper, the State
Department official whose bureau licenses arms exports.

"The Saudis and Emiratis have become so intertwined with the Trump
administration that [[I don't think the president is capable of
distinguishing America's national interests from
theirs]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Representative Tom Malinowski, a New
Jersey Democrat who sits on the committee. "[[The administration has
presented us **no evidence** that Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.
face]{.underline}]{.mark} any substantially new or [[intensified threat
from Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} that would justify declaring an
emergency."

Mr. Malinowski, a top human rights official under President Obama, said
the bombs were for use in Yemen, not for defending the Saudi or Emirati
homeland from Iran, as some Trump administration officials have
suggested.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

A Raytheon spokesman said there was nothing unusual about the production
arrangement.

"Industrial participation by local partners has been an element of
international sales of military equipment for decades," said the
spokesman, Mike Doble. "These activities and related technologies are
governed by the Arms Export Control Act, controlled by the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations, and conform to all licensing rules and
restrictions of the United States government."

Defense contractors have established close ties with the Trump
administration, and key executives from several companies, including
Raytheon, have made their way into high-ranking positions. Raytheon's
former vice president for government relations, Mark T. Esper, was
confirmed as Army secretary in 2017.

The defense firm has also cultivated ties to the Saudi government.
During President Trump's visit to the kingdom in May 2017, Raytheon
signed an agreement to work more closely with the Saudi Arabian Military
Industries Company, a holding company owned by the country's sovereign
wealth fund. It was unclear whether the new production deal fell under
that plan.

The production agreement took some lawmakers by surprise. Representative
Ted Lieu, a California Democrat and an outspoken critic of the Yemen
war, said it seemed "to serve no purpose other than to forfeit our
technology and prevent future congressional oversight."

[[The arrangement]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} effectively [[outsource
jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}, appears [to be [at odds
with]{.mark}]{.underline} Mr. [[Trump's position that arms sales are
important because of the American jobs they create]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Rob Berschinski, a senior vice president at Human Rights First, an
advocacy group, said the administration's decision was "about siding
unreservedly with favored Middle Eastern authoritarians, no matter who
they kill or how they repress their citizens." Mr. Berschinski, a former
deputy assistant secretary of state, added, "It has nothing to do with
American jobs."

Congress had been informally blocking the sale of the smart bombs at
least since May last year, when Mr. Menendez and Representative Eliot L.
Engel, the New York Democrat, expressed concerns over how the Saudis
were using the weapons in Yemen. Opposition intensified after American
intelligence officials concluded that the Saudi government played a role
in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and columnist for
The Washington Post.

But then, last month, on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Mr.
Trump took the rare step of declaring an emergency to push these weapons
out the door.

In a May 24 letter, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified
congressional leaders of the emergency declaration, waiving
congressional review of the weapon sales. Mr. Pompeo said he took into
account "political, military, economic, human rights and arms control
considerations." The State Department on Monday disclosed more details
to Congress, including the nature of the arms sales.

"[[If Saudi Arabia is able to develop a]{.underline}]{.mark}n indigenous
[[bomb-making capability]{.underline}]{.mark} as a result of this deal,
[[it will **undermine** U.S. **leverage**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
prevent them from engaging in indiscriminate strikes of the kind it has
carried out in Yemen," said William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and
Security Project at the Center for International Policy, a think tank.

The authorization paperwork signed by Mr. Pompeo offers no timeline for
the shared operations to get underway, and Raytheon representatives have
said they are still negotiating over details with the Saudi government,
according to a congressional aide.

Aside from potentially providing the Saudis with more bombs to use in
Yemen airstrikes, the arrangement raised security concerns among
lawmakers, who were seeking assurances that the Saudis could prevent the
American technology from falling into the wrong hands.

Both Republicans and Democrats also noted that it called for creating
manufacturing jobs in Saudi Arabia that might otherwise have been
located in the United States. And they expressed worry that the [[Saudis
might eventually **copy the tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[and use
it to **produce their own** weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, which they
would be free to use in Yemen or sell to whomever they chose.

Mounting concerns over U.S. involvement in Yemen: Experts believe that
the [[weapons are]{.underline}]{.mark} likely to be [[diverted to the
frontlines in Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark}, where a proxy war between Iran
and Saudi Arabia has raged for nearly five years. In April, the House
voted to end American involvement in the war in Yemen, sending a
stinging rebuke to the Trump administration's support for the military
campaign led by Saudi Arabia in the war-battered country.

"There's sort of an implication that the Saudi-led coalition have used
up their weaponry and are in desperate need of a resupply," said Jeff
Abramson, senior fellow at the Arms Control Association. "There are
probably targets left which they have yet to hit, in which case you
could expect these weapons to be used in those cases."

Since 2015, the Saudi-led coalition has carried out nearly 20,000
airstrikes, according to the Yemen Data Project. Over 6,000 of those
have been non-military air raids, with close to 7,000 more strikes of
unknown nature. [[American-made warplanes and bombs have played a
central role in the coalition's]{.mark} extensive [air
campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Trump administration maintains that direct engagement with Saudi
Arabia can improve their ability to discriminate between civilian and
military targets.

Under President Barack Obama, there was a sense that U.S. efforts to
improve Saudi targeting capabilities were working until 2016, when the
coalition bombed a crowded funeral home. The attack killed at least 155
people and wounded about 600, including the mayor of the capital city,
who had been playing a significant role in negotiating a peaceful end to
the war.

Discomfort over U.S. involvement in Yemen grew after the incident, and
Obama blocked sales of precision-guided munitions to the coalition after
the high-profile incident.

"[[We tried engagement, and their behavior **didn't
improve**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Abramson said. "The track record shows
that [[it is more by showing the Saudis that we are willing to
**criticize** them and **walk away** that they **get the message** that
they need to improve their behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}."

However, a State Department official told FRONTLINE that U.S. engagement
with the Saudi-led coalition has contributed to a decrease in civilian
casualties.

"[[We remain committed to working with Saudi Arabia
to]{.underline}]{.mark} improve processes which [[mitigate the risk of
civilian harm]{.underline}]{.mark} during combat operations," the
official said. "Sustained engagement with the Coalition is the best way
to do this."

Kori Schake, a top national security official in the George W. Bush
administration, said that without U.S. assistance and support, the
Saudis are likely to be even less capable of achieving a military
objective without causing exorbitant civilian damage.

The conflict's total death toll is fast approaching the 100,000 mark,
according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The U.N.
attributes 65 percent of civilian deaths in Yemen to coalition
airstrikes.

"Even [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} tomorrow the [[Saudis were to improve
their targeting practice]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[people
would]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[die at an unacceptably high
rate]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Scott Paul, Senior Humanitarian Policy
Advisor at Oxfam.

#### Arms end up in hands of terrorists and militias -- removing sales are key

Hodeidah, Yemen (CNN) -- [[Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have
transferred American]{.mark}-made [weapons to **al Qaeda**-linked
fighters]{.mark}]{.underline}, hardline Salafi militias, and other
factions waging war in Yemen, in violation of their agreements with the
United States, a CNN investigation has found.

The [[weapons have also made their way into the hands of Iranian-backed
rebels]{.underline}]{.mark} battling the coalition for control of the
country, exposing some of America\'s sensitive military technology to
Tehran and potentially [[endangering the lives of US
troops]{.underline}]{.mark} in other conflict zones.

[[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark} Arabia [[and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rab
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}mirates, its main partner in the war, [[have
used the]{.underline}]{.mark} US-manufactured
[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} as a form of currency [[to buy the
loyalties of militias or tribes]{.underline}]{.mark}, bolster chosen
armed actors, and influence the complex political landscape, according
to local commanders on the ground and analysts who spoke to CNN.

[[By handing off]{.mark} this [military equipment to third
parties]{.mark}, the [Saudi]{.mark}-led coalition [is **breaking the
terms** of its arms sales]{.mark} with the US, according to the
Department of Defense]{.underline}. After CNN presented its findings, a
US defense official confirmed there was an ongoing investigation into
the issue.

The revelations raise fresh questions about whether [[the US has lost
**control** over a key ally presiding over one of the most horrific
wars]{.mark}]{.underline} of the past decade, and whether Saudi Arabia
is responsible enough to be allowed to continue buying the sophisticated
arms and fighting hardware. Previous CNN investigations established that
[[US-made weapons were used in a series of deadly Saudi coalition
attacks that killed dozens of civilians]{.mark}, many of them
children]{.underline}.

The developments also come as Congress, outraged with Riyadh over the
[[murder of]{.underline}]{.mark} journalist Jamal
[[Khashoggi]{.underline}]{.mark} last year, [[considers whether to force
an end to the Trump admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration\'s [[support
for]{.mark} the [Saudi]{.mark}]{.underline} coalition, which relies on
American weapons to conduct its war.

In 2015, Riyadh launched a coalition to oust Iranian-supported Houthi
rebels from the country\'s capital and reinstate the internationally
recognized government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. The war split
the country in two, and with it came the weapons \-- not just guns, but
anti-tank missiles, armored vehicles, heat-seeking lasers and artillery
\-- all flooding into an unruly and complex state.

Since then, some of [[America\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} \"beautiful
[[military equipment]{.underline}]{.mark},\" as US President Donald
Trump once called it, [[has been]{.underline}]{.mark} passed on, sold,
stolen or [[**abandoned** in Yemen\'s state of
chaos]{.underline}]{.mark}, where murky alliances and fractured politics
[[mean little hope for any system of accountability]{.underline}]{.mark}
or tracking.

Some [[**terror groups** have gained from the influx of US
arms]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the barrier of entry to advanced
weaponry now lowered by the laws of supply and demand. [[Militia leaders
have]{.underline}]{.mark} had ample opportunity to obtain [[military
hardware in exchange for the manpower to fight the Houthi
militias]{.underline}]{.mark}. Arms dealers have flourished, with
traders offering to buy or sell anything, from a US-manufactured rifle
to a tank, to the highest bidder.

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- Circumvention

#### Trump will circumvent because he only cares for profit -- that worsens the humanitarian crisis in Yemen

[[The US plans to send billions of dollars in weapons
to]{.mark}]{.underline} Middle Eastern allies --- including [[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[by declaring an emergency that experts
say **doesn't really exist**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Multiple reports detail that [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} officials
[[are considering using a legal loophole]{.underline}]{.mark} within
days [[to export roughly]{.underline}]{.mark} \$7 billion in [[arms to
Saudi Arabia and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rab [[E]{.underline}]{.mark}mirates, both of
[w[hich have waged a brutal war in Yemen against Houthi
rebels]{.mark}]{.underline} for more than four years.

The idea, pushed by Secretary of State Mike
[[Pompeo]{.underline}]{.mark} and other top officials,
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} allow the administration to
[[**circumvent** Congress's authority to]{.mark} approve or [reject
weapons sales]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There is a provision in a weapons export law allowing the executive
branch to sell arms without congressional sign-off if "an emergency
exists which requires the proposed sale in the national security
interest of the United States." Administrations rarely invoke it,
experts say, mainly because of how controversial it is and the high bar
required to claim a dire situation exists.

President George W. [[Bush used the provision]{.mark} in 2006 [to
send]{.mark}]{.underline} precision-guided [[weapons to
Israel]{.mark}]{.underline} during the Israel-Hezbollah July War, but
that was last time an administration [[took advantage of the
loophole]{.underline}]{.mark}.

President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[will claim that
Saudi Arabia and the UAE **need** new munitions because they face
repeated attacks from Houthi rebels]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, the
Yemen war has raged since 2015, with the US supporting the Saudi-led
coalition's side. It's jarring now to say that an emergency exists after
all this time, especially when the US previously sold weapons to the
Saudis through the normal process.

There's also the fact that introducing [[more weapons to the war will
likely **worsen** a catastrophic situation]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
conflict has already claimed tens of thousands of lives; some estimates
indicate that at least 60,000 people have died, though it's hard to keep
an accurate tally because of dangerous conditions in Yemen. Last August,
the Saudi-led coalition carried out a horrific attack on a school bus
where dozens of people, including 40 children, died.

[[The US sending more munitions]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia and the UAE
likely [won't do much to tip the scales of the
fight]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[but could imperil the lives of millions
of people]{.mark} in Yemen already suffering]{.underline} from wounds,
famine, and disease.

"The Trump administration is manufacturing an emergency to push through
the sale of deadly weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates," Scott Paul, a Yemen expert at the humanitarian group Oxfam
America, told me. "Once again, the Trump administration is demonstrating
that it values profit and its Gulf allies over resolving the world's
largest humanitarian crisis."

The Trump administration knows Congress likely wouldn't approve the deal

News of the loophole plan comes at a particularly tense moment.

The US and Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival, are locked in a
potentially deadly standoff. Earlier this month, the Trump
administration said it had intelligence showing that Iran planned to
attack Americans in the Middle East. As a result, the US put an aircraft
carrier, bomber planes, and anti-missile batteries in the region, though
it's not clear exactly where. The administration is even considering
sending thousands of troops to the region, perhaps in an effort to deter
an Iranian assault.

Iran, meanwhile, told its proxies in Iraq to prepare for war if the US
attacks, and has greatly accelerated low-enriched uranium production for
its nuclear program (though it has not said that it plans to pursue a
nuclear weapon). The weeks-long crisis has split Democrats and
Republicans in Congress over just how forcefully the US should engage
Iran right now, while Saudi Arabia has mostly pushed for America to
seriously get involved.

Lawmakers from both parties remain enraged with the Trump
administration's handling of the killing of Saudi journalist, dissident,
and US resident Jamal Khashoggi last October. Despite ample evidence
showing a planned, coordinated assassination, Trump did little to punish
Riyadh other than impose a few sanctions.

That wasn't enough for many Democrats and Republicans, including
reliable Trump allies. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), for example, told
reporters on Thursday that he would "not do business as usual with the
Saudis until we have a better reckoning" with Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, the country's de facto ruler who US spies say ordered the
Khashoggi hit.

The likely reason the administration wants to invoke the loophole is not
that an emergency exists, then, but that Trump officials fear lawmakers
might shoot down the arms sale.

"President Trump is only using this loophole because he knows Congress
would disapprove of this sale," Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), who first
raised awareness of the administration's plan, told the Wall Street
Journal on Thursday. "It sets an incredibly dangerous precedent that
future presidents can use to sell weapons without a check from
Congress."

Trump has long prioritized weapons sales over human rights

Asked by reporters last November if he would stop a massive arms sale to
Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's killing, Trump emphatically said no.

"This took place in Turkey and to the best of our knowledge, Khashoggi
is not a United States citizen," he said in the Oval Office. "I don't
like stopping massive amounts of money that's being poured into our
country," referring to his desire to sell \$110 billion worth of weapons
to Riyadh, adding that "it would not be acceptable to me."

a dissident journalist: \"I don\'t like stopping massive amounts of
money that\'s being poured into our country\... they are spending \$110b

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}'s comments made one thing extremely clear:
He [[cares much more about getting American companies **paid** than
defending h]{.underline}]{.mark}uman [[r]{.underline}]{.mark}ights. It
was perhaps one of Trump's most honest articulations about how he
conducts foreign policy: He won't call out a country that infringes on
human dignity as long as it's willing to inject cash into the American
economy.

Partly for that reason, Trump has continued to strengthen America's
relationship with the Saudi regime despite its conduct in Yemen, its
stoking of tensions with Iran, and the Khashoggi murder. And now, with
the impending use of the loophole, it appears Trump has literally put a
price tag on the lives of those already suffering in the Saudi-led war.

"[[Yemenis will continue to pay the price of the]{.mark} US's
**[indefinite]{.mark}**]{.underline} and unconditional support of one
side in their country's horrific **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Paul,
the Oxfam expert, told me.

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration announced last week that
it [[will declare an **emergency**]{.underline} [to
allow]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[companies to sell arms to Saudi Arabia
and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rab
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}mirates. [[That]{.underline}]{.mark} emergency
[[**circumvents** Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and the usual
bureaucratic process for approving US arms sales. By selling about \$ 8
billion worth of precision guided munitions and combat aircraft,
President Trump advances his view of Saudi Arabia as a \" great ally \"
of the United States.

[[Trump\'s move is **legal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Under
the]{.underline}]{.mark} 1976 [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rms
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}xport [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct, the State Department authorizes arms sales
(or does not). As I explain below, Congress usually allows decisions to
be implemented without objection. But this time,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} administration has invoked the act\'s
provision that allows [[president]{.underline}]{.mark}s to [[sidestep
congressional reviews]{.underline}]{.mark} if they believe a national
security emergency requires the arms to be sold. In doing so, it is
ignoring the bipartisan resolution that Congress passed in April to halt
US military support for the Saudi war in Yemen.

While no one is surprised that [[Dem]{.underline}]{.mark}ocratic
senator[[s are voicing outrage]{.underline}]{.mark}, what is unusual is
that [[Rep]{.underline}]{.mark}ublican[[s are forcefully objecting,
too]{.underline}.]{.mark} Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) Called circumventing
Congress as \"big mistake,\" and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (RS.C.) said ,
\"I do not support arms sales,\" and criticized Trump for \"doing
business as usual\" with Saudi Arabia.

### 2AC -- AT: Solvency -- Pompeo Circumvention

#### Removing arms key to solve -- Trump won't be able to circumvent Congress

**[Bazzi 6/8]{.underline}** \[Mohamad Bazzi, a journalism professor at
New York University, is a former Middle East bureau chief at Newsday. He

"Trump wants to sell more weapons to Saudi Arabia. Congress must stop
him." *The Guardian*, 8 June 2019,
theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/08/saudi-arabia-trump-weapon-arms-sales-must-be-stopped\]

On the Friday before Memorial Day, when few Americans were paying
attention, the [[Trump admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration announced
that it [[would **circumvent** Congress]{.mark}]{.underline} and sell
\$8bn in new weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It
was Donald Trump's latest attempt to give a blank check to two US allies
leading a disastrous war in Yemen.

[[If Trump succeeds in getting around Congress, these weapons sales will
prolong **suffering** in Yemen and eliminate]{.underline}]{.mark} one of
the last levers that allowed the US to exert [[**influence** over Saudi
and Emirati actions]{.underline}]{.mark}: the threat of Congress
blocking arms deals.

On 5 June, a bipartisan group of senators said they would try to block
the administration from going ahead with the sales by introducing 22
"resolutions of disapproval" -- one for each of the deals cleared by
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The effort is led by two unlikely
allies: Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey and frequent Trump
critic, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who is one
of Trump's biggest supporters.

The two senators agree on one thing: that Saudi Arabia should face more
scrutiny of its actions in Yemen after Saudi agents murdered the
journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in
October. Since then, members of [[Congress have tried to
force]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[to reexamine its alliance with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
kingdom -- especially its relationship with Mohammed [[bin
Salman]{.underline}]{.mark}, the brash and ruthless crown prince often
considered an architect of the Yemen war. [[But
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} and his senior aides have made clear that
they still support the prince and [[won't]{.underline}]{.mark} try to
[[isolate him]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite a CIA assessment that
concluded, with "high confidence", that Prince Mohammed ordered the
killing of Khashoggi.

The senators' effort, which includes seven co-sponsors, is yet another
example of Congress trying to claw back its constitutional
responsibilities. On 24 May, when Pompeo notified Congress that the
administration would move ahead with the \$8bn deals without
congressional approval, [[he cited a rarely used]{.underline}]{.mark}
provision of the [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rms
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}xport [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct [[which allows the president to bypass
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} if he determines there is an emergency
that impacts national security. Pompeo invoked the Trump
administration's favored bogeyman: an increased threat of "Iranian
aggression".

But over the past month [[the admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[has
**inflated** the threat]{.underline}]{.mark} posed by Iran to US troops
and allies in the Middle East and several hawkish Trump aides,
especially national security adviser John Bolton, have pushed for a new
confrontation with Tehran. At Bolton's request, the Pentagon updated
plans to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East. [[The
admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[is using]{.underline}]{.mark}
similar [[**scare tactics** to justify its end-run around Congress to
sell more weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

#### Despite efforts to regulate arms sales, Trump circumvented them -- only removing solves

WASHINGTON --- [[Senators]{.underline}]{.mark} from both parties on
Wednesday [[accused]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[of
**overstepping**]{.underline}]{.mark} its authority [[by pushing through
arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark} and other Arab allies in
May [[without]{.underline}]{.mark} congressional
[[approval]{.underline}]{.mark}, and vowed to reassert the role of
Congress in reviewing weapons deals.

Lawmakers vented their frustration at a hearing with the State
Department official overseeing arms sales, C. Clarke Cooper, telling him
the administration had failed to make the case why \$8 billion in
weapons sales had to be expedited without time for congressional
oversight.

\"For whatever reason, [[the admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration --- in
what seems to me a not fully baked decision-making process --- decided
to circumvent the law, [[decided to **circumvent** the constitutional
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} of Congress and act unilaterally,\"
said Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

Cruz added: \"And don\'t make the mistake of thinking that it is simply
Democrats who are concerned about this.\"

If the administration attempted to bypass Congress again, Cruz said he
would oppose the move and predicted other Republicans would as well.

Several [[Rep]{.underline}]{.mark}ublican[[s **have joined**
Dem]{.underline}]{.mark}ocrat[[s in supporting bills disapproving of the
arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}, but President Donald Trump has promised
to veto the measures. Opponents would need to secure more Republican
votes to overturn a Trump veto.

Congress usually has 30 days to review all arms sales. But on May 28,
Secretary of State Mike [[Pompeo]{.underline}]{.mark} invoked a rarely
used provision in arms control law to bypass Congress and declare an
emergency to [[expedite the weapons deals]{.underline}, [which he said
were justified due to the threat posed by Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}.
