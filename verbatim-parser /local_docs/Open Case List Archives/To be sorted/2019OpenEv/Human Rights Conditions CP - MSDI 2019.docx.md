Cohen earned his A.B. at Amherst in 1967 and his J.D. in 1971 from Yale.
As a law student, he studied with legendary professor Marvin
Chirelstein, a mentor who inspired Cohen to pursue a teaching career in
tax. He was deeply involved in the antiwar movement and in Senator
Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential campaign. Cohen worked at the very
heart of the campaign, even traveling on the plane with the candidate.
"Very heady stuff for a 22-year-old," Cohen once noted. He joined the
Carter Administration in the 1970s. Serving first on the policy planning
staff at the State Department, he later became a deputy assistant
secretary of state for human rights. "He was involved, then, in the very
early formulation of a human rights diplomacy at the center, rather than
the periphery, of foreign policy," Professor Emeritus Norman Birnbaum
wrote of Cohen. He joined the Georgetown Law faculty in 1980 ---
teaching classes including Basic Federal Income Taxation, Taxation of
Corporations and Shareholders, and Tax Policy: South African System ---
but continued to serve as a contributor to major national and
international newspapers, "carry\[ing\] his convictions and knowledge in
human rights into the public forum," Birnbaum noted. Cohen focused on
South Africa at the State Department and later was appointed by
President Bill Clinton to the board of the Southern African Enterprise
Development Fund, financing new businesses in Southern Africa, and the
Academic Advisory Board of the International Human Rights Law Group.
Cohen considered tax law to be closely connected to human rights,
viewing tax systems "as concrete expressions of a society's real
conception of justice," according to Birnbaum.//Phops

Country-Specific Legislation [In 1974, [when Congress originally enacted
section 502B, it also began to pass legislation to limit military aid
and arms sales to designated countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
country-specific legislation was contained in bills authorizing or
appropriating funds for military aid, and it named, at various times,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, the
Philippines, South Korea, Uruguay, and Zaire.42 The legislation usually
mentioned only military aid and was effective for a single year,
although in two cases it expressly prohibited arms sales as well and was
of indefinite duration. [[Congress has successfully attached
country-specific legislation to bills authorizing or appropriating
military aid for every fiscal year]{.mark} since 1975]{.underline}.43
For example, Chile was prohibited from receiving any military aid in
fiscal 197544 and the amount requested for South Korea was substantially
reduced.45 The legislation for fiscal 1976 contained an indefinite
embargo on both military aid and arms sales to Chile.46 For fiscal 1977,
military aid to Uruguay was banned.47 For fiscal 1978, proposed military
aid was eliminated for Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala,48
Nicaragua, Paraguay,49 and Uruguay,50 and reduced for the Philippines.51
Beginning in fiscal 1979, an indefinite ban was placed on both military
aid and arms sales to Argentina.52 In budgets for fiscal 1980 and 1981,
Congress reduced military aid for Zaire.53 The legislation for fiscal
1981 also eliminated it for Guatemala.54 Although usually applicable
only to military aid and of limited duration, the country-[specific
legislation was also a finding by Congress that the Executive had failed
to apply section 502B to a government engaged in \"gross violations\"
and that \"extraordinary circumstances\" would not justify past levels
of military aid. The repeated willingness of Congress to legislate on
specific countries placed the Executive on notice: unless it began to
apply section 502B, Congress might legislate again.]{.underline} While
this prospect did not move the Ford and Nixon administrations to alter
their practice, it appears to have had significant influence on the
Carter administration.

ADJUSTING U.S. SALES With U.S.-provided bombs used in many of the war's
deadliest civilian fatality incidents, [[Congress has ample rationale to
block, delay, or condition future arms sales to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Depending on the results of this week's
election, the Senate's cross-party, forty-seven-seat opposition to such
sales could become a majority. Saudi intransigence on the Khashoggi case
or Yemen peace talks could also flip more senators into supporting a
joint resolution against new weapons packages. In all likelihood, the
president would veto any such resolution unless Congress can show that
it has carefully weighed the costs---in terms of both neglecting the
legitimate security needs of a long-term partner and harming America's
status as a security ally and arms vendor. To address these concerns,
[the U.S. government should apply some common-sense guidelines: Think
ahead and review the details of arms sales]{.underline}. Under the Obama
administration's watch, Saudi Arabia gained far greater military
capabilities and was empowered to act in pursuit of its own security.
The lack of a detailed, forward-looking, top-to-bottom review of U.S.
arms sales to Riyadh concealed this reality. Prior to considering new
sales, then, Congress should insist that the State Department and
Pentagon provide an in-depth, holistic assessment of the kingdom's
military capabilities, security sector organization, future plans,
related purchase needs, and alternative suppliers, outlining the
implications that these findings hold for U.S. security. [[Arms sales
should be driven by a clear-eyed, long-term assessment of U.S. strategic
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}, not by simple economic opportunism or
the self-defined priorities of Saudi leaders. [Do not deny systems that
are mostly defensive in nature]{.underline}. Some Saudi capabilities
represent welcome burden-sharing with U.S. forces in defending the
Persian Gulf region and containing Iran. Washington's desire to hold
Saudi leaders accountable for problematic actions is understandable,
[but it should not be used to craft policies that reward
Tehran]{.underline}. [The United States has a strong strategic interest
in]{.underline} [continuing to provide naval systems, missile defenses
(including THAAD), and support for border defense and force
protection]{.underline} (e.g., counter-mine and counter-indirect fire
systems). These systems represent 54 percent (or \$26.5 billion) of the
\$48.81 billion in Saudi arms sales proposed by the Trump administration
to date, and a sizable prize for the U.S. economy. [[Condition and slow
the provision of mostly offensive systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
described above, the kingdom could use certain systems to take the war
deeper into Yemen, including M1A2S tanks, self-propelled artillery, and
PGMs. [[Delaying or conditioning their delivery is therefore
justifiable, perhaps with a proviso that they not be deployed in
Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} unless the Houthis prove unwilling to engage
in peace talks. [[Washington]{.underline} [could]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[tie sales to a halt in high-risk urban
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Secretary Pompeo suggested on October
30.

ZEID RA'AD AL HUSSEIN, United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights, noted that [[the devastation caused by small arms never failed
to elicit unanimous declarations of dismay]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
States then push for weak management regimes. "The reason is clear," he
said: "[The trade in small arms is a multi-billion-dollar
business]{.underline}." However, the human and economic cost loomed even
larger. "[These are the weapons of the easy kill: the most portable,
most easily accessible, most casual instruments of death --- even a
small child can, with its tiny muscles, vanquish a life.]{.underline} In
war, however appallingly, it is often the child that receives the
bullet." The most vulnerable, those who could not flee conflict, were
often the primary victims of arms-fuelled conflict, and inexplicable
human cruelty was assisted by the availability of arms. Arms
profiteering, he stressed, was the partner of war crimes. [The contrast
was breathtakingly stark]{.underline}, he said, between the comfortable
profits of the weapons brokers and the victims of their use. "Small arms
do not only make easy the taking and maiming of lives, but also kill
economies and the social bonds on which every kind of collective
institution and progress rely," he stated. [Denial of education and
health, criminality, illicit plundering of natural resources, decreased
trade and investment, violence against women and girls, gang violence
and the collapse of the rule of law were also facilitated]{.underline}.
He called the entry into force of the ATT a source of hope in that bleak
landscape, [[if it was widely acceded to and implemented genuinely,
particularly articles 6 and 7, which provided for the human rights
standards that were at the heart of the Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
Council should continue to strongly support the ATT and should mandate
operations to build implementation capacity into their activities. He
further supported consideration of the suggestion of his predecessor,
Navi Pillay[, [to make a condition of each large arms sale the funding
of a small human rights monitoring team, and other creative thinking
about this serious problem.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The [Carter]{.mark} administration [did not automatically terminate all
sales of defense items when a government was considered to be engaged in
\"gross violations\"]{.mark}]{.underline} and \"extraordinary
circumstances\" were not found[. [It adopted instead a \"flexible\"
approach and broke up]{.underline}]{.mark} the panoply of defense items
subject to the Arms Export Control Act (and therefore section
[[502B]{.mark})]{.underline} [into a number of subcategories: (1) New
weapons]{.underline}: tanks, artillery, fighters and bombers, and naval
warships; [(2) Spare parts]{.underline} for previously acquired weapons;
[(3) Support equipment]{.underline}: trucks, unarmed aircraft and ships,
radios, and radars; [and]{.underline} [(4) Safety-related
items]{.underline}: ambulance aircraft and air-sea rescue equipment. New
weapons were consistently withheld, whenever requested. On the other
hand, [safety-related items were almost never denied, and spare parts
and support equipment were approved]{.underline} for sale on numerous
occasions.121 These [exceptions]{.underline}, of course, [are contrary
to the literal language of section 502B]{.underline}, and the regional
bureaus advocating approval felt it necessary to construct a legal
rationale for this position. The exception for safety-related items was
justified in terms of the underlying purpose of the statute, that is,
the protection of basic human rights. To disapprove the sale of
equipment devoted to rescuing lives, it was argued, would defeat the
basic goals of the statute. Items in the two middle categories (spare
parts for weapons and support equipment) were approved on the basis of a
different, but related, consideration: that a sale of defense items was
on occasion needed to encourage another government to improve human
rights conditions, and that spare parts and support equipment (as
contrasted with new weapons) were an acceptable means of providing an
inducement. In effect, section 502B was read to mean that Congress was
concerned most about actual weapons and would be willing to permit the
sale of other items when it was reasonable to suppose that it would lead
to human rights improvements. While [the exception]{.underline} for
safety-related items [appears reasonable because of the direct
connection with saving lives]{.underline}, that for spare parts and
support items is fraught with danger. Such [items are as critical to
military performance as weapons themselves.]{.underline} Moreover, spare
parts and support equipment typically make up a large part of a
military\'s total acquisitions. Thus, [to continue]{.underline} to
approve such items [is to continue a significant military supply
relationship]{.underline} between the United States and the recipient.
This danger may be acceptable if there are definite advantages to be
gained in terms of human rights improvements. The risk, however, is that
[[exceptions will be granted on the basis of unrealistic hopes that
improvements will follow]{.underline}]{.mark}. If that turns out to be
the case, then making these [[exceptions could
undermine]{.underline}]{.mark} the purposes of [[section
502B]{.underline}.]{.mark} The inducement rationale was invoked to
justify spares and support items for five Latin American countries:
Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, and Uruguay.122 While in no
case was there clear evidence that making exceptions helped induce a
government to improve human rights conditions, it also appears that, for
the latter four countries, approvals did little harm, perhaps because
relatively small dollar amounts were involved.123 However, in the case
of Argentina the [exception appears to have been abused]{.underline}.
Argentina was considered to be one of the most serious human rights
violators in the non Communist world because of the torture and summary
execution of thousands of political dissidents and other
\"undesirables\" by government security forces.124 During 1977 and 1978,
Argentina submitted requests to purchase about \$200 million in defense
items from the United States. The Latin American Bureau argued that
approval of spares and support items was justified under section 502B as
not involving new weapons and as an inducement for Argentina to improve
human rights conditions. The Bureau of Human Rights was opposed on the
grounds that section 502B contained no exception for spare parts and
support items and that, in any case, approval was unlikely to have the
desired effect. The Secretary of State found the former\'s arguments
persuasive and approved the sale of nearly \$120 million in weapons.125
[It now appears that the approval of spares and support items was based
on unrealistic hopes and did not elicit steps to curb
abuses]{.underline} in Argentina. Human rights violations continued at a
high level throughout the period during which these items were sold.126
The dollar value of U.S. arms sales to Argentina in 1978 was actually
higher than in any prior year.127 Consequently, the Argentine Government
may have believed the American executive branch to be deeply divided
over whether security assistance to Argentina should be affected by its
human rights practices, and this belief may have substantially reduced
the impact of American human rights pressures on Argentina during 1977
and most of 1978. [[The level of abuses there began to decline only
after a statutory embargo on all security assistance, enacted by
Congress, went into effect]{.underline}]{.mark} on October 1, 1978.128
Thus, the numerous [[exceptions]{.underline}]{.mark} for spare parts and
support equipment before that date were not only of doubtful legality,
but also [[undermined the basic purpose of the
legislation]{.underline}.]{.mark}

The [Obama]{.underline} administration has [told Congress it won't
complete approval for Bahrain to buy as many as 19 F16]{.underline}
fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corp. and upgrades for older ones for
almost \$4 billion [until the Gulf ally demonstrates progress on human
rights]{.underline}, according to people familiar with the issue. [The
declaration of concern]{.underline}, which doesn't specify what steps
Bahrain would have to take, was included in a draft notification of the
pending sale that the administration sent to Congress on Wednesday,
according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing
details of the message that wasn't released publicly. The proposed sale
to Bahrain is one of three involving fighter jets by Lockheed and Boeing
Co. to Persian Gulf allies, according to people familiar with the
decision. The initial, informal notifications to Congress say the
potential sales include as many as 72 Boeing F15 jets to Qatar and as
many as 32 of the company's F/A18 E/F fighters to Kuwait, according to
one of the people. Crackdown on Dissent While the long-delayed sales
would deliver on President Barack Obama's promise to bolster the defense
of Gulf allies worried by U.S. participation in the nuclear deal with
their arch-rival Iran, [[the strings attached to the Bahrain
sale]{.underline}]{.mark} in the draft, which could still change,
[[reflect concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} in the administration [[over
that government's crackdown on dissent and
opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Without specifying how much Bahrain
must do before the arms sale can move forward, the Obama administration
is calling on its rulers to reverse its moves suppressing nonviolent
opposition and dissolving the al-Wefaq political society, the main
opposition group of the country's Shiite majority, according to an
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
administration is also concerned by continuing legal actions against
Sheikh Issa Qassim, al-Wefaq's leader, and the detention of human-rights
activist Nabeel Rajab, the official said. Secretary of State John Kerry
has previously condemned the decision to dissolve al-Wefaq, saying the
government's efforts to suppress nonviolent opposition undermine
Bahrain's cohesion and security. The Arab nation hosts the U.S. Navy's
5th Fleet in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain's embassy in Washington said in a
statement Friday hat the kingdom "has continuously taken extensive
social, political, economic and judicial reform measures and is
committed to continue its reform plans," which it said are often
downplayed. It said Bahrain "is highly concerned with the manner the
Foreign Military Sales case has been politicized," and "the government
will not tolerate those exploiting sectarian rifts, either domestically
or regionally." An aide to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Bob Corker of Tennessee said the conditions proposed for the Bahrain
deal will be evaluated by the panel as part of its review of the planned
sale. Review Timetable [[The arms sales notifications sent to lawmakers
this week begin an informal review to take as long as 40
days]{.mark}.]{.underline} That would be followed by an official, public
notification, after which the deals would go through [unless Congress
moves to stop them within 30 days.]{.underline} In addition to the 19
new F16s valued at as much as \$2.8 billion, the sale to Bahrain would
include upgrades costing as much as \$1 billion to Bahrain's existing
F16 fleet, according to the informal notification. Unlike Bahrain, the
planned sales for Qatar and Kuwait are being proposed without
conditions. "Anytime there are strings attached, countries are less
likely to complete a deal," said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with
the Arlington, Virginia-based Lexington Institute who also consults for
Lockheed, said in an e-mail. Older Planes "If Bahrain goes elsewhere for
its fighters, that would destroy U.S. jobs and undermine U.S. influence
in the region," said Thompson, who indicated he was aware in general
terms of the administration's conditions. [[Concerns on issues such as
human rights are normally taken into account in deciding whether to sell
arms to a country, not included as a condition in notifying
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Joel Johnson, an analyst who follows
foreign military sales for the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. The arms
sales to the Gulf allies will help the U.S. contractors keep assembly
lines running for their older fighters as U.S. purchases shift to
Lockheed's new F35. "This order is very important to Lockheed Martin,"
Michael Rein, a spokesman for the Bethesda, Maryland-based contractor,
said in an e-mail. "We have been aggressively pursuing additional F16
orders and without this sale to Bahrain we run the very real risk of the
F16 line shutting

down. Bahrain is a valued customer and key partner."

The advantages of having most firearms on the CCL are obvious, which is

[Many states continue to supply arms to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition
despite years of devastating war in Yemen]{.underline}, but in recent
weeks pressure has been mounting on major suppliers. On 11 September, UK
MPs held an emergency debate on the issue, at which the UK government
defended continuing arm sales. A poll published on the same day found
that just 13 percent of the British public support arms sales to Saudi
Arabia. On 12 September, [US Congress forced a discussion on whether
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are undertaking
sufficient measures to protect civilians in Yemen.]{.underline} The
[Trump]{.underline} administration stated that both countries "are
undertaking demonstrable actions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians
and civilian infrastructure", [givi]{.underline}ng [the green light for
continued US support.]{.underline} However [there have recently been
some encouraging signs that the tide is turning]{.underline}. Over the
past year many countries including Belgium, Germany, Norway and Greece
have responded to public pressure by partly or totally suspending arms
transfers to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other coalition members. Legal
challenges are currently underway in the UK, France and Italy to compel
these governments to comply with their legal obligations and stop
supplying arms for use in Yemen. "More and more countries are waking up
to the fact that [arming Saudi Arabia and the coalition bombing Yemen is
incompatible with international law and humanitarian
principles]{.underline}, and countries like the [USA, UK and France are
starting to look grossly out of step with the growing international
consensus]{.underline}," said Steve Cockburn. "This week the Spanish
government has a choice. It can continue with business as usual by
honouring trade deals that have the potential to increase the horrendous
suffering of Yemeni civilians, or it can take a principled and
law-abiding approach and suspend all arms transfers to Saudi Arabia and
its coalition members. We are calling on Spain to set an example for
other countries, and end this shameful chapter in its history."
Background [All parties to the conflict in Yemen have repeatedly
committed violations of international law resulting in horrific
suffering for civilians. The Saudi]{.underline} Arabia-led [coalition
has carried out scores of unlawful attacks]{.underline}, including
indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes that have killed and
injured civilians and destroyed civilian objects, including homes,
schools, hospitals, markets and mosques. Huthi forces have
indiscriminately shelled civilian-populated areas, especially in Tai'z,
Yemen's third largest city. They have laid antivehicle mines
indiscriminately, used banned antipersonnel landmines and recruited
children to fight, and arbitrarily detained, forcibly disappeared and
tortured people in areas they control.

The Case for Arms Sales [Few tools have been used in pursuit of so many
foreign policy objectives as arms sales.]{.underline} The United States
has sold weapons to its NATO allies to ensure their ability to defend
Western Europe; to friendly governments around the world facing
insurgencies and organized crime; to allies in the Pacific (buffering
them against China's rising military power); and to both Israel and many
of its Arab neighbors in efforts to maintain regional stability and
influence over Middle Eastern affairs. The United States has used arms
sales, as well as the threat of denying arms, in efforts to influence
human rights policies, to help end conflicts, to gain access to military
bases, and to encourage fair elections. Since 9/11, the new central
focus of U.S. weapons sales has been to bolster the global war on
terror.36 Despite their many uses, arms sales impact foreign affairs
through two basic mechanisms. The first involves using arms sales to
shift the balance of power and capabilities between the recipient and
its neighbors, thereby helping allies win wars or deter adversaries,
promote local and regional stability, or buttress friendly governments
against insurgencies and other internal challenges.37 During the Cold
War, American arms sales became part of a broader strategy to deter the
Soviet Union from invading Western Europe. In the wake of the 9/11
attacks, the United States sold weapons to Afghanistan and Iraq to
bolster their ability to defeat the Taliban, al Qaeda, and the Islamic
State. By selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and
Australia, the United States hoped to balance rising Chinese power and
promote regional stability. Although the specific objectives differ, at
root the causal mechanism is the same: using arms sales to shift the
balance of power in a direction more favorable to American interests.38
The second mechanism involves [using arms sales to generate leverage
over the conduct of other nations. As the producer of the world's most
advanced and sought-after weaponry, the United States can dictate, at
least to some degree, the conditions under which it will agree to sell
certain weapons]{.underline}.39 As Andrew Shapiro puts it, "[When a
country acquires an advanced U.S. defense system, they are not simply
buying a product to enhance their security, they are also seeking a
relationship with the United States]{.underline}... . [This]{.underline}
engagement helps [build bilateral ties and creates strong
incentives]{.underline} for recipient countries to maintain good
relations with the United States."40 American [influence is thought to
be most potent in cases where the United States provides a nation with a
large share of its military capabilities]{.underline}. In the wake of
U.S. pressure to halt Israeli defense exports to China, for example, an
Israeli official acknowledged, "If the United States, which provides
Israel with \$2 billion in annual military aid, demands that we will not
sell anything to China --- then we won't. If the Americans decide we
should not be selling arms to other countries as well --- [Israel will
have no choice but to comply]{.underline}."41 [The United States has
used arms sales to try to encourage states to vote with the United
States at the UN]{.underline}, to support or adopt pro-Western and
pro-U.S. foreign policies, to convince Egypt and Israel to accept peace
accords, and to gain access to military bases in places such as Greece,
Turkey, Kenya, Somalia, Oman, and the Philippines. After the Cold War,
the United States also sought to tie arms transfers to human rights and
democratization efforts in client states.42 [Arms sales remain
attractive to presidents for three main reasons. First, arms sales are
less risky than sending American troops]{.underline}, providing explicit
security guarantees to other nations, or initiating direct military
intervention, even long distance.43 In cases where allies or partners
are likely to engage in conflicts with their neighbors, providing
weapons rather than stationing troops abroad can lessen the risk of
American entrapment in crises or conflicts. Taiwan is an example of this
sort of arms-for-troops substitution. On the other hand, in instances
where the United States has an interest in conflicts already underway,
arms sales can be used in attempts to achieve military objectives
without putting American soldiers (or at least putting fewer of them) in
harm's way. This tactic has been a central element of the American war
on terror, with sales (and outright transfers) of weapons to Afghanistan
and Iraq to support the fight against the Taliban, al Qaeda, and ISIS,
as well as to Saudi Arabia for its war in Yemen.44 In both situations
the reduction of military risk, in particular the risk of American
casualties, also helps reduce the political risk. Presidents who would
otherwise abstain from supporting a nation if it entailed sending
American troops can sell arms to that country without the political
fallout that sending America troops abroad would incur. [Second, arms
sales are an extremely flexible tool of statecraft]{.underline}. In
contrast to the blunt nature of military intervention, or the long-term
commitment and convoluted politics that treaties involve, arms sales can
take any form from small to large and can take place on a one-time or
ongoing basis; they can be ramped up or down and started or stopped
relatively quickly, depending on the circumstances. Selling arms to one
nation, moreover, does not prohibit the United States from selling arms
to any other nation. And thanks to their capacity and prestige,
[American weapons serve as useful bargaining chips in all sorts of
negotiations between the United States and recipient
nations.45]{.underline} Finally, arms sales represent a very low-cost
and low-friction policy tool for the White House.46 Unlike military
intervention or stationing troops abroad, arms sales are not dependent
on defense budgets or on a laborious congressional process. And since
most arms deals receive little publicity, presidents don't have to worry
about generating support from the public. As a result, the president can
strike an arms deal unilaterally and at any time. Moreover, since most
political leaders view arms sales as an economic benefit to the United
States, the president tends to receive far more encouragement than
pushback on the vast majority of arms deals. [Inevitably, the fact that
arms sales are low cost and easy to implement means that presidents
reach for them frequently, even if they are not necessarily the best
tool for the job.]{.underline}

For these reasons, a general rule that sets forth basic goals may be
preferable to country-specific legislation. [Yet the history of section
502B suggests that the creation or tightening of a general rule will
produce, by itself, little change in executive behavior]{.underline}.
[Special implementing mechanisms are required if a substantive rule is
to have a direct influence on decisions. Because the career bureaucracy
can be expected to abuse the discretion allowed by a general
rule,]{.underline} a countervailing center of bureaucratic influence is
essential to implementation. [When Congress does provide an implementing
mechanism, implementation will still be highly dependent on the
attitudes of high political officials]{.underline}. If they are hostile,
[even a general rule written with a high degree of precision will
probably have little impact on executive decisions.]{.underline} The
career Foreign Service will exert no influence on political appointees
to implement the law, and the Bureau of Human Rights can be effectively
neutralized. The Assistant Secretary is a presidential appointee, and a
hostile administration can either select someone to fill the position
who will not push for implementation or simply leave the post vacant.
[In such a case, country-specific legislation is the only effective
means for Congress directly to influence specific decisions on military

The Attitude of the Career Bureaucracy [The career bureaucracy of the
Department of State is the Foreign Service]{.underline}, and the core of
the Foreign Service serves in the five regional bureaus for Africa, East
Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Near East. Each bureau has
responsibility for managing relations with countries within its region,
including issues of military aid and arms sales. [The opposition of the
Foreign Service to section 502B was a logical consequence of its
conception of its special role]{.underline} or of (what one student of
the bureaucracy has labeled) its \"organizational essence.\"57 [The
Foreign Service views its primary role or essence as the maintenance of
smooth and cordial relations with other governments]{.underline}.58 [It
believes that military aid and arms sales are an indispensable means to
achieving this goal]{.underline}. When provided, the other government is
grateful and more inclined to get along with the United States. [When
refused, a cordial relationship may be harder to maintain]{.underline},
especially if the other government suspects that the reason for refusal
is a judgment that it has mistreated its own citizens. [Keeping other
governments happy becomes an end in itself]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} phenomenon [is often referred to as \"clientism\"
because the Foreign Service views other governments a\"clients\" with
whose interests it identifies, rather than as parties to be dealt with
at arm\'s length according to the national interest of the United
States.59]{.underline} The [regional bureaus]{.underline} generally
[make recommendations without rigorously analyzing whether providing
security assistance to a particular government will]{.underline}, in
fact, [serve concrete foreign policy objectives]{.underline} of the
United States. Nor is there consideration of whether alternative means
might accomplish what is desired. There is rarely exploration of whether
the United States might supply economic aid or count on mutual interests
to achieve diplomatic goals. Furthermore, costs are typically excluded
from the calculation. The time horizon of the career bureaucracy is
short and the possible long-run disadvantage of aiding repressive
governments seems alien to its thinking. Even after the examples of Iran
and Nicaragua, there is rarely consideration that a particular regime
may be overthrown and United States support for it resented by those who
follow. Nor is the damage to U.S. standing in the world, or the conflict
with both international legal obligations and traditional American
values, weighed in the balance. In effect, the career bureaucracy
develops its position by reckoning the national interest in terms of
pleasing its \"clients,\" the governments with which it conducts
diplomatic relations.60 The phenomenon of \"[clientism\" has a number of
causes]{.underline}. [A Foreign Service officer is typically required to
develop personal relations and spend substantial periods of time with
high officials of other governments]{.underline}. He tends, therefore,
to sympathize and identify with their point of view.[61 If the other
government is accused of human rights abuses, he deals with officials
who either deny the accusations or explain the excesses as
regrettable,]{.underline} but necessary to stem \"terrorism\" and avoid
social chaos. He is much less likely to encounter the victims of
repression and hear their point of view. In addition, [the tour of duty
in the Foreign Service is usually of 2 to 3 years\']{.underline}
duration, after which the officer is rotated to another post. An officer
is likely to work on country A for 3 years, then switch to country B,
then to country C, and so on. Thus, [the short duration reduces the
incentive to consider the longer run consequences of
decisions.]{.underline} Moreover, the penalty for questioning
established values is heavy.62 According to one recent Deputy Under
Secretary of State: Under the present system, the key factor in
determining whether an officer will be promoted is the efficiency report
written by his immediate supervisor. The knowledge that the good opinion
of his supervisor is crucial in determining whether an officer advances
at a normal rate or falls behind and is eventually selected out can act
as a powerful deterrent to his forthright expression of views on policy
matters which may be at variance with views of his supervisor.63 Since
1973, when Congress first enacted section 32, [the regional
bureaus]{.underline} [have continually opposed implementation of
legislation conditioning security assistance on human rights
concerns]{.underline}. They have virtually never initiated a proposal
that military aid or arms sales be cut off or reduced on account of a
government\'s human rights performance. Even after the Carter
administration entered office in 1977, [the regional bureaus vigorously
fought nearly all attempts to apply section 502B to specific
cases.]{.underline} This resistance took a number of different forms.
First, they tried to minimize the relevance of section 502B. During the
first 2 years, they argued that it could be ignored because it was
merely a statement of policy and not legally binding. After it was made
legally binding, they argued that the statutory rule was only one of
several factors to be weighed in decisions on security assistance.64
Second, [the career bureaucracy attempted to distort information about
human rights conditions in particular countries.]{.underline}65 The
extent of abusive practices was consistently underreported. For example,
the Bureau for East Asia persisted in arguing that reports of Indonesian
abuses in East Timor were grossly exaggerated and that few abuses had
been committed by the Indonesian Army against the Timorese. In fact, an
accumulation of reports from reputable sources indicates that a hundred
thousand or more Timorese may have died at the hands of the Indonesian
military.66 In the case of Argentina, the Latin American Bureau argued
that, at most, hundreds of individuals had been summarily executed by
security forces. As the evidence became incontrovertible that the number
was actually 6,500 or more, the bureau shifted gears and argued that
only Marxist terrorists were the victims.67 When it was documented that
most of the victims were neither Marxists nor terrorists, the bureau
maintained that the abuses were the work of local military commanders
whom the ruling junta was struggling to control. [As it minimized or
concealed negative aspects of a \"client\'s\" human rights practices,
the career bureaucracy exaggerated positive signs]{.underline}.
Improvements were said to have occurred on the basis of insubstantial
evidence or self-serving declarations of the government in power. In
1978, for example, the Bureau for the Near East reported that the Shah
of Iran was undertaking amajor liberalization program, including an end
to torture, release of all political prisoners, and transfer of
political authority to an elected parliament.68 It predicted that this
plan would be favorably received by broad segments of the Iranian
population.69 It did not communicate, however, that credible reports of
torture persisted, that the secret police continued to arrest political
dissidents, that parliamentary elections were rigged and parliamentary
powers evanescent, and that Iranians generally regarded the
\"liberalization\" program as a sham.70 In 1979, the Bureau of African
Affairs expressed similar optimism about a decision by Mobutu Sese Seko,
President of Zaire, to permit formation of a legislative assembly. While
the bureau admitted that the assembly lacked direct political authority,
it was still touted as having unlimited powers to debate and question
government policies. The bureau neglected to report that Mobutu
threatened assembly members who tried to pry into sensitive subjects,
such as official corruption, and effectively stopped their inquiries.71
Third, [the regional bureaus overstated the extent of U.S. interests at
stake in particular cases and the damage that could possibly result from
failure to approve proposed security assistance]{.underline}. The Latin
American Bureau, for example, insisted (albeit unsuccessfully) that
failure to provide military aid to Paraguay would seriously undermine
arelationship with the Stroessner Government that was importanto
fighting communism in Latin America. In another case, the Bureau for
East Asia warned that, unless military aid to the Philippines was
tripled, the United States might lose its military bases there. To
support its contention, the bureau cited a threat by President Ferdinand
Marcos to terminate an existing base agreement that still had 11 years
to run. It failed to report, however, the opinion of a variety of
experts that the threat was empty and that Marcos would not risk
breaking the legal obligation under an existing treaty.72 [There were a
few exceptions to the pattern of beliefs and behavior described
above.]{.underline} Individual Foreign Service officers did attempt on
occasion to challenge the wisdom of providing security assistance,
although their chances of success were small and such questioning risked
damaging their careers.73 Overall, [the \"clientist\" impulse is thus
quite strong and for the most part accurately describes the behavior of
the career Foreign Service.]{.underline}

This examination of [attempts by Congress to require the Executive to
withhold]{.underline} military aid and [arms sales]{.underline} on human
rights grounds suggests another important issue: whether withholding is
an effective instrument for enforcing adherence to international human
rights law. A definitive answer to this question is far from easy to
obtain. It may be difficult to determine whether a government has taken
positive steps to improve human rights conditions. Changes that are
merely \"cosmetic\" must be distinguished from those which indicate real
improvement. [When positive changes do occur, it may be difficult to say
whether U.S. actions or other factors were decisive. But the fact that
positive changes are lacking does not mean that U.S. actions have been
ineffective.]{.underline} Although [a targeted government may not have
altered current practices, it may be deterred from worse
violations]{.underline}. Moreover, [regimes other than the immediate
target may be influenced by the risk of being denied United States
security assistance if they engage in repression]{.underline}. While the
impact of withholding security assistance on human rights practices is
beyond the scope of this article, it is the logical next question for
scholars interested in international human rights.

[The Development of a Body of Precedents Because of the
administration\'s policy of not making explicit findings under section
502B, the legal basis for particular outcomes was rarely made clear to
the contesting bureaus.]{.underline}93 It was often difficult to say in
a particular case exactly why the Secretary of State believed that
section 502B did or did not apply. If security assistance was approved,
it might have been because the government was found not to be engaged in
gross abuses; or that it was, but fit within the extraordinary
circumstances exception; or that some other consideration, not
explicitly mentioned in section 502B, was read into the statute and had
determined the outcome. If security assistance was disapproved, it was
never formally stated that this was because the proposed recipient was
considered to be a gross violator under section 502B. [Owing to this
lack of clear direction and the persistence with which both the Human
Rights Bureau and the regional bureaus pursued their respective
objectives]{.underline}, a considerable volume of action memorandums on
security assistance [issues were produced]{.underline} during the first
half of the Carter administration. After the initial period, however,
when a body of precedents was created, the amount of \"litigation\"
began to decrease94 as contesting bureaus inferred by the pattern of
outcomes how the Secretary of State was interpreting section 502B.95 The
major issues of interpretation are discussed below. The three key
questions were: (1) When was a foreign government considered to be
engaged \"in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally
recognized human rights\"? (2) What U.S. interests constituted
\"extraordinary circumstances\"? (3) What was encompassed by the
category \"security assistance\"? 1. Gross Violations. [The threshold
issue under section 502B is whether a particular government \"engages in
a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized
human rights.\"]{.underline} At the outset, it is necessary to explain
that the issue never arose with respect to many governments that appear
to have practiced gross abuses. [The question whether section 502B might
apply to them was never raised because they were never seriously
considered for security assistance for a variety of reasons other than
human rights]{.underline}. For example, Communist countries (the Soviet
Union and its Warsaw Pact neighbors, and Cambodia, China, and Vietnam)
and Soviet client states (such as Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iraq,
Libya, and South Yemen) were barred for national security reasons.96 In
addition, a number of countries (for example, Chile97 and South
Africa98) were already prohibited by other legal requirements from
receiving security assistance. After these countries were eliminated,
approximately 70 remained that were seriously considered for military
aid and arms sales. A narrow reading of the \"gross violations\"
language was adopted, so that, in the end, only about 12 of the 70 were
thought to fall within it. While in some respects the narrow reading was
consistent with the congressional purpose, in others it appeared to
subvert the intended meaning of the statute. The narrow reading was
derived from the way that the four basic elements of the category were
interpreted. First, there must be violations of \"internationally
recognized human rights.\" Second, the violations must be \"gross.\"
Third, the frequency of violations must result in a \"consistent
pattern.\" Fourth, the government itself must be engaged, which is to
say, responsible for the violations. [A definition of internationally
recognized human rights is contained in section 502B
itself]{.underline}. According to subsection (d)(1), [this term
\"includes torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
punishment, prolonged detention without charges and trial, and other
flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of the
person\"]{.underline} (emphasis added).99 The use of the word
\"includes\" suggests that the list of abusive practices in the statute
is not meant to be allencompassing. The formulation is open-ended and
holds out the distinct possibility that violations other than those
listed might trigger the termination of security assistance. However,
the statute\'s sponsor, Representative Fraser, opposed this view, and
the legislative history contains strong evidence that Congress wanted
the quoted language to be interpreted narrowly rather than expansively.
In 1974, when section 502B was first enacted, Representative Gross (R.,
Iowa) offered an amendment (which was defeated) to expand the coverage
to all human rights generally.100 The rejection of the Gross amendment
implied that Congress intended to focus only on one narrow, albeit very
important, category of human rights abuses involving torture, arbitrary
imprisonment, and cruel and inhuman punishment. The Carter
administration followed Fraser\'s interpretation. In its decisions on
security assistance, it was careful to go no further than required by
the abuses specifically listed in subsection (d)(1). A government was
considered to fall within it only when it practiced arbitrary
imprisonment, torture, or summary execution of relatively large numbers
of its own people. That a government was authoritarian, denied basic
civil and political liberties, or failed to promote basic economic and
social rights was not, by itself, enough to invoke the statutory
prohibition on military ties. The second element, that the violations
must be \"gross,\" was read to mean that they must be significant in
their impact. For example, although arbitrary imprisonment is one of the
listed violations, detention without charges for several days was not
considered \"gross\" because of the relatively brief period of
confinement. Third, the element of a \"consistent pattern\" was held to
mean that abuses had to be significant in number and recurrent. Isolated
instances of torture or summary execution, while certainly gross abuses,
would not trigger termination of security assistance under section 502B.
For example, the reported imprisonment and torture of several dozen
labor leaders in Tunisia was considered not to be sufficient by itself
to constitute a \"consistent pattern.\" This reading of \"consistent
pattern\" is not unreasonable, given Representative Fraser\'s concern
that the statute not reach too broadly. However, an additional gloss was
put on this language that seems at odds with the congressional purpose.
Even when gross abuses were significant in number and recurrent, the
\"pattern\" was occasionally held not to be \"consistent,\" if steps
were taken to stop some abuses. Perhaps the most dramatic example of the
use of this interpretation to avoid a section 502B problem is the case
of Indonesia. At the beginning of 1977, its Government appeared to be
engaged in gross abuses on two fronts. In Indonesia proper, it was
holding thirty thousand prisoners, in detention since the 1966 civil
war, on suspicion of Communist sympathies.101 At the same time, it was
annexing East Timor and in the process of exterminating perhaps one
hundred thousand or more civilian inhabitants of that island.102 The
adoption and implementation of a plan for freeing the thirty thousand
prisoners within 3 years was considered sufficient to \"break\" the
consistent pattern, notwithstanding evidence of continuing gross abuses
on a large scale in East Timor. Ordinarily, the fourth element, that the
government itself engage in or be responsible for the violations, was
not an issue if the other criteria were already met. In most instances,
governments did not deny responsibility but sought to justify the abuses
to U.S. officials on grounds of national security, fighting terrorism,
anticommunism, and the like. Absent such an admission, however, the word
\"engages\" was read to require \"approval\" by the highest ranking
officials of the government in question, even if they lacked effective
control over the military forces committing the abuses.

[U.S. law establishes the conditions under which the U.S. government and
U.S. commercial entities may sell defense articles to foreign
countries]{.underline}. This In Focus provides an overview of the main
laws and policies that may limit such sales on the basis of human rights
concerns. Background [The Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} (AECA;
P.L. 90-629; 22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) an[d the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961]{.underline} (FAA; P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) [establish
provisions governing]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales
[(FMS)]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Direct Commercial Sales
([DCS]{.underline}) to foreign consumers, including foreign governments.
FMS refers to the sale of U.S.-origin defense articles, equipment,
services, and training (hereafter referred to as "defense articles") on
a government-to-government basis. DCS refers to the sale of
U.S.-government licensed defense articles and services directly from
U.S. firms to eligible foreign governments and international
organizations. The AECA and FAA establish eligibility prerequisites for
the sale of defense articles to foreign purchasers. The acts also
require that such sales be for specific authorized military purposes and
subject to end-use monitoring (EUM). The acts authorize the termination
of future sales and deliveries if a recipient is found to be in
substantial violation of a sale-related agreement with the United States
or to be otherwise using such defense articles for unauthorized
purposes. The FAA and executive branch policy restrict certain sales of
defense articles to foreign recipients found to have committed human
rights violations. General Limitations on FMS and DCS [Although the AECA
does not refer specifically to human rights, the act includes general
provisions and conditions for the export of U.S.-origin defense articles
that may indirectly address human rights concerns]{.underline}. For
example,  Section 38(a)(1) of the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1))
authorizes the President to control the import and export of defense
articles for broad policy goals, including world peace and U.S. security
and foreign policy.  Section 42(a) of AECA (22 U.S.C. 2791(a)) requires
the executive branch, to consider, among other factors, whether a given
defense article sale might "increase the possibility of outbreak or
escalation of conflict." See also Section 511 of the FAA (22 U.S.C.
2321d).  Section 3(a) of AECA (22 U.S.C. 2753(a)) requires prospective
recipients of defense articles to meet certain prerequisites for
eligibility. These include purchaser commitments to refrain from
transferring title to or possession of any defense article to
unauthorized persons, as well as from diverting articles for
unauthorized purposes or uses. See also Section 505(a) of the FAA (22
U.S.C. 2314(a)).  Section 4 of the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2754) states that
defense articles may be sold or leased for specific purposes only,
including internal security, legitimate self-defense, and participation
in collective measures requested by the United Nations or comparable
organizations. See also Section 502 of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2302). 
Section 3(c)(1)(B) of the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2753(c)(1)(B)) prohibits the
sale or delivery of U.S.- origin defense articles when either the
President or Congress find that a recipient country has used such
articles in substantial violation of an agreement with the United States
governing their provision or "for a purpose not authorized" by Section 4
of the AECA or Section 502 of the FAA. (See also Section 505(d) of the
FAA (22 U.S.C. 2314(d)).) If found to be in violation by presidential
determination or joint resolution of Congress, Section 3(c)(3) of the
AECA (22 U.S.C. 2753(c)(3)) stipulates that, absent a presidential
waiver, such countries would be ineligible for future U.S. arms sales
until the President determines the violation has ceased and recipients
assure violations will not recur. Human Rights-Related Prohibitions on
Security Assistance [Section 502B of the FAA]{.underline} Section
502B(a)(1) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)(1)) [states that a "principal
goal" of U.S. foreign policy "shall be to promote the increased
observance of internationally recognized human rights by all
countries."]{.underline} To this end, Section 502B(a)(2) of the FAA (22
U.S.C. 2304(a)(2)) [stipulates that, absent the exercise of a
presidential waiver, no security assistance may be provided to any
country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross
violations of internationally recognized human rights.]{.underline}
"Security assistance" is defined by Section 502B(d)(2) of the FAA (22
U.S.C. 2304(d)(2)) to include, for the purposes of the section, "sales
of defense articles or services, extensions of credits (including
participations in credits), and guaranties of loans" under the AECA.
This section also defines security assistance to include  assistance
provided pursuant to part II of the FAA for military assistance (chapter
2), the economic support fund (chapter 4), military education and
training U.S. Arms Sales and Human Rights: Legislative Basis and
Frequently Asked Questions (chapter 5), peacekeeping operations (chapter
6), or antiterrorism assistance (chapter 8); and  any license in effect
with respect to the export to or for the armed forces, police,
intelligence, or other internal security forces of a foreign country of
(i) defense articles or defense services under Section 38 of the AECA
(22 U.S.C. 2778); or (ii) items listed under the 600 series of the
Commerce Control List \[a list that contains specific dual-use
commodities, technologies, and software that are controlled for
export\]. "Gross violations of internationally recognized human rights"
is defined in Section 502B(d)(1) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)). In
determining whether a government has engaged in such violations, Section
502B(a)(4) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)(4)) requires the President to
give particular consideration to international religious freedom.
Section 502B(b) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2304(b)) additionally tasks the
Secretary of State to prepare a report to Congress (the annual Country
Reports on Human Rights Practices) with information on prospective
foreign recipients of U.S. security assistance. Specified topics for the
report include information on war crimes, crimes against humanity,
genocide, coercion in population control, anti-Semitism, extrajudicial
killings, trafficking in persons, freedom of the press, and child
marriage. Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 (CSPA) Foreign
governments with security forces (including police) or
government-supported armed groups that recruit or use child soldiers are
prohibited from receiving certain types of security assistance, absent a
presidential waiver. Pursuant to Section 404(a) of the CSPA (P.L.
110-457; 22 U.S.C. 2370c-1), the prohibition applies to the extension of
FMS credits and the issuance of DCS licenses, among other identified
authorities in the FAA and AECA. Each year, the State Department
publishes a list of CSPA countries in its annual Trafficking in Persons
Report. Frequently Asked Questions How does the current Administration's
conventional arms transfer policy address human rights considerations?
[Pursuant to a national security presidential memorandum of April 19,
2018, U.S. arms transfer decisions must take into consideration several
factors, including "human rights and international humanitarian
law."]{.underline} Specified considerations include the risk that an
arms transfer would contribute to abuses of human rights, including acts
of gender-based violence and acts of violence against children. The
memorandum prohibits transfers of conventional arms if the U.S.
government has "actual knowledge at the time of authorization" that such
a transfer "will be used" to commit genocide, crimes against humanity,
or certain human rights violations in breach of the Geneva Conventions.
How does U.S. policy guidance on arms sales address human rights
consideration? The Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) provides
the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) with policy guidance for executing
arms sales. Among its provisions, the SAMM requires senior U.S. Embassy
leadership to prepare a Country Team Assessment (CTA) that describes and
justifies support for a proposed arms sale. Such CTAs accompany letters
of request for certain significant arms sales, including those requiring
congressional notification pursuant to Section 36 of the AECA. According
to Table C5.T1 of the SAMM, all CTAs must include a description of the
"human rights ... record of the proposed recipient and the potential
misuse of the defense articles in question." How does the U.S.
government verify that recipients use defense articles as authorized?
Pursuant to Sections 38(g)(7) and 40A(a) of the AECA (22 U.S.C.
2778(g)(7) and 2785(a)), and Section 505(a)(3) of the FAA (22 U.S.C.
2314(a)(3)), U.S. origin defense articles sold via FMS and DCS are
subject to end-use monitoring (EUM) to ensure that recipients use such
items solely for their intended purposes. DOD's Defense Security
Cooperation Agency manages the department's Golden Sentry EUM program
for defense articles sold via FMS. The State Department's Directorate of
Defense Trade Controls coordinates the Blue Lantern program, which
performs an analogous function for items sold via DCS. Can arms
embargoes be applied on the basis of human rights concerns? [Human
rights considerations are among the reasons the United States may invoke
to impose an arms embargo on a foreign government and prohibit U.S.
persons from selling or transferring defense articles to such
governments.]{.underline} The International Traffic in Arms Regulations
reflect the executive branch's implementation of statutory provisions
related to the export of defense articles, including those related to
arms embargoes. In addition, the U.N. Security Council may apply an arms
embargo against a country for human rights purposes; Section 5 of the
United Nations Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c) authorizes the
President to implement such sanctions. Do the Leahy Laws apply to arms
sales? The U.S. "Leahy Laws"---Section 620M of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2378d)
and 10 U.S.C. 362---prohibit U.S. security assistance to a foreign
security force unit when there is credible information that such unit
has committed a "gross violation of human rights" (GVHR)---described by
the State Department to mean (1) torture, (2) extrajudicial killing, (3)
enforced disappearance, or (4) rape under color of law (in which a
perpetrator abuses their official position to commit rape). In order to
comply with the laws, the State Department leads a process of unit-level
GVHR vetting before providing security assistance, including training
and equipping. The Leahy Laws, however, do not define security
assistance; in practice, the executive branch considers the term to mean
support provided with U.S.- appropriated funds and, in its view, the
restrictions are thus not applicable to FMS or DCS.

[Garnering less attention in Congress]{.underline} thus far has been the
pending notification to sell F-16s to Bahrain, a Saudi-coalition
partner. In considering such a sale [in 2016, the Obama administration
attached an undisclosed set of preconditions to encourage the Bahraini
government to improve its human rights record]{.underline}. [Those
conditions likely included the release of human-rights activist Nabeel
Rajab and other measures to reverse suppression of nonviolent opposition
after the forced closure of the al-Wefaq political party.]{.underline}
Those and many other steps have not been taken[.]{.underline} Instead,
on Friday the United Nations Committee Against Torture warned of
continued ill-treatment of detainees and called on Bahraini authorities
to release Rajab, who had been held in solitary confinement for more
than nine months. Just as [a deal to arm Saudi Arabia with offensive
weapons would signal that the United States is unconcerned with how a
country addresses human rights]{.underline}, so too would a new F-16
sale to the repressive Bahraini regime. The national security goals are
also unclear. F-16s appear to have little relevance in combating AQAP or
the Islamic State. Nor do they further efforts that might resolve
problematic Iranian activity. Further complicating the situation, just
last week, Congress was notified of a potential \$2 billion sale of
Patriot missiles to the United Arab Emirates, whose forces are expected
to be in the vanguard of any offensive on Hodeida. Even though that sale
would not be of "offensive" weapons, serious concerns about detainee
abuse should also give Congress pause as to whether to reward Abu Dhabi.
While there are certainly many challenges in the Middle East, [agreeing
to arms deals with regimes in Riyadh and Manama that have a record of
impunity]{.underline} when conducting airstrikes or suppressing their
citizenry [runs counter to long-standing U.S. principles and
goals.]{.underline}

[Some developing countries are also implementing stricter national
guidelines]{.underline} [for the sale]{.underline} and transfer [of
arms]{.underline}. A notable example is [South Africa]{.underline},
which in July 1995 [adopted new policies that impose conditions on the
transfer of weapons]{.underline} to dozens of countries experiencing
civil strife or human rights abuses \[60\]. Guidelines for arms
transfers adopted in 1996 require South African arms exports to be
screened according to human rights and security criteria and approved by
a cabinet-level committee whose chairperson must be a Minister with no
direct interests concerning arms transfers \[61\]. In a further
significant step South Africa also announced in February 1999 that it
would henceforth destroy surplus weapons to avoid their entry into
circulation internally or internationally. In so doing [the government
expressed "grave concern about the proliferation of small arms which is
having a devastating effect on the socio-economic development and
reconstruction of civil societies in Southern Africa]{.underline}"
\[62\]. China has also recently published an English language version of
its arms export regulations which came into force in January 1998
\[63\]. Because [so much of the light weapons trade begins as legal
transfers but ends up as illicit trafficking, the role of national
governments in tightening and enforcing export regulations will be of
crucial importance]{.underline}. In particular, [there needs to be more
effective coordination of both national policies and the efforts of
different law enforcement agencies.]{.underline} Currently, [huge
variations exist between countries regarding what types of arms may be
sold, domestically and abroad]{.underline}, and which types of weapons
require export licenses. While policy-makers are beginning to recognize
the implications of the massive flows of small arms throughout the world
and the initiatives taken offer a degree of encouragement, relatively
few practical measures have been adopted to effectively control
international transfers of small arms and light weapons. In contrast to
the controls in place for nuclear and chemical weapons and major weapons
systems, which took decades to develop, efforts to control small arms
and light weapons remain tentative and modest. It is also important to
note that most efforts have highlighted the human rights and
developmental impact of the transfer of military-style arms, although
the availability of such weapons has enormous implications for
international humanitarian law. Indeed, the stated purpose of most
transfers is to enable recipients to engage in armed conflict. [Even if
serious violations of international humanitarian law also represent
violations of human rights]{.underline}, it is regrettable that among
the existing body of export codes and national legislation known to the
ICRC [only the European Union Code of Conduct mentions respect for
international humanitarian law as a basis for decisions on arms
transfers. Controlling small arms and light weapons will not
be]{.underline} an [easy]{.underline} process. The trade in light
weapons is a complex phenomenon, involving many types of actors, and
existing knowledge of the dynamics involved is far from comprehensive.
It is also evident that [traditional arms control approaches are not
well suited for the control of small arms and light
weapons]{.underline}. Thus [much creative effort -- involving the
participation of many types of experts, including representatives of
governments, industry, police and customs services, humanitarian aid
organizations and human rights groups -- will be needed to develop new
approaches and strategies.]{.underline} One new approach would be to
consider [controls not only on the transfer of arms but also on
munitions and ammunition.]{.underline} As mentioned above, the
shelf-life of many of the tens of millions of small arms and light
weapons now in circulation may be measured in decades if the weapons are
properly maintained. Such arms are currently spread throughout the
world. By contrast, it appears that factories for the production of
munitions and ammunition can be far more easily identified. The reliable
shelf-life for these items is said to be shorter than for the weapon
itself. [Non-State entities may be reluctant to accept the risk to life
and weapons systems which 'home-made' production of munitions and
ammunition would entail]{.underline}. As a result, [efforts to limit
their availability could, in the short term, yield significant
results.]{.underline}

[The United States should keep training and advising Saudi forces if
they meet certain conditions, but it should end refueling support to
Saudi aircraft operating near Yemen.]{.underline} This PolicyWatch is
the second in a two-part series on potential adjustments to the
bilateral security relationship. Part 1 offered recommendations on
delaying and conditioning arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Last week,
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis laid out
a sequence for ending hostilities in Yemen: the Houthi rebels are
expected to cease border and missile attacks, after which the Saudi-led
coalition is to halt high-risk airstrikes in populated areas, thus
laying the ground for peace talks. Yet if the hoped-for talks wind up
failing (as the previous round did earlier this year in Geneva when the
Houthis refused to attend), [Washington will likely intensify its
scrutiny of U.S. operational support to the Saudi war
effort]{.underline}. Since the conflict began in 2015, Congress has
debated whether to end support activities such as refueling coalition
aircraft and providing advise/assist functions in Saudi Arabia. Yet
discussion of these missions often loses sight of their limited scale
and, in the case of advisory support, their crucial defensive and
diplomatic value. U.S. TRAINING SUPPORT Saudi operations in Yemen are
evolving. The air war is slowing down and becoming more selective, with
air-dropped weapon releases declining from nearly 200 per day in the
early weeks of the war to less than 10 per day in 2018. On the ground,
however, the Saudi military presence inside Yemen has expanded from well
under 1,000 troops at the beginning of this year to around 3,000 today,
comprising elements of six brigades from the Saudi Arabian National
Guard (SANG) and Royal Saudi Land Forces. Although the U.S. military
plays a very minor role in directly supporting operations in Yemen, the
Saudi war effort draws indirectly on the large U.S. training missions
and contractor support services that keep the kingdom's armed forces
operating. These programs, which are fully funded by the Saudi
government, include: The U.S. Military Training Mission. Operating
continuously since the 1950s, the 200-strong USMTM is based in Riyadh
and works directly with each branch of the Defense Ministry, fulfilling
the crucial role of processing U.S. Foreign Military Sales from concept
through delivery. This mission has never been withdrawn from the country
during any crisis, even when the United States removed its air
operations headquarters from Prince Sultan Air Base in 2002. OPM-SANG.
Another few hundred U.S. military personnel and contractors oversee the
U.S. Army's Office of the Program Manager-Saudi Arabian National Guard
(OPM-SANG). This mission has operated continuously since 1973 to
organize, equip, and train SANG, a multi-brigade collection of armored
infantry, helicopters, and artillery that has become the kingdom's
second-largest land force. MoI-MAG. In 2008, the U.S. Army set up a
smaller Ministry of Interior-Military Assistance Group to help the
Saudis develop critical infrastructure security capabilities and build
out their Facilities Security Forces, Special Security Forces, Border
Guards, and General Security Aviation Command. This training mission
contributes to protecting the world's largest energy installations,
fighting terrorism, and developing the Border Guards, the force that has
suffered the highest casualties in the Yemen war due to Houthi raids
into Saudi Arabia. OPERATIONAL SUPPORT On June 8, the Trump
administration acknowledged that U.S. forces "have continued to provide
military advice and limited information, logistics, and other support to
regional forces combating the Houthi insurgency in Yemen," though he
made clear that this was "a non-combat role." This support includes:
Advice on lawful targeting. On February 27, the Pentagon informed
Congress that a small number of U.S. personnel were providing "advice
regarding compliance with the law of armed conflict and best practices
for reducing the risk of civilian casualties." Secretary Mattis
confirmed this point on October 30, describing how legal and weapons
advisors are working to improve the capabilities of Gulf coalition
forces so that "they are not killing innocent people." Border and
missile defense assistance. On April 17, Assistant Defense Secretary for
International Security Affairs Robert Karem told Congress that "roughly
50" U.S. personnel had been deployed to Saudi Arabia to advise "on
Houthi ballistic missile threats to the kingdom." Media outlets have
reported that U.S. personnel are also helping Saudi border forces reduce
their casualties from Houthi roadside bombs. REFUELING SUPPORT The
latest statistics from U.S. Central Command suggest that American forces
are supporting the Saudi air campaign in Yemen with an average of 101
refueling sorties per month, or around 3 per day. In military
terminology, this means that approximately 400,000 pounds of daily
"offload" is available to Saudi aircraft involved in fighter missions,
command and control, intelligence, and reconnaissance. The kingdom pays
for the fuel and can call for deliveries as part of the bilateral
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement, which gives the United States
various logistical and access rights as well. In total, fuel deliveries
to Saudi aircraft amount to less than 5 percent of the U.S. Air Force's
daily deliveries in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. Moreover, Secretary
Mattis recently noted that the USAF provides less than 20 percent of the
fuel consumed in daily Saudi air operations over Yemen---more than 80
percent is provided by the Royal Saudi Air Force's thirteen large air
refueling platforms. In other words, [if Washington reduces or cancels
this refueling support, it would have minimal effect on Saudi operations
inside Yemen---with one important exception.]{.underline} In general,
[the kingdom's air force operates relatively close to Saudi
airfields]{.underline}, thereby [reducing the overall offload
requirement for air-to-air refueling]{.underline}. [Defensive
operations]{.underline} on the border [would not be
affected]{.underline} because they are undertaken at a range of 150
nautical miles from the main airbase at Khamis Mushait. [Yet a refueling
cutoff could complicate Saudi operations deeper inside Yemen, such
as]{.underline} opportunistic airstrikes in Sana, Saada, and other
[urban locales that present a high risk of civilian
casualties]{.underline}. On October 30, Secretary Pompeo stated that
coalition airstrikes "must cease in all populated areas in Yemen,"
suggesting that a cutoff might be a useful way of signaling Riyadh and
shaping Saudi operations. POLICY OPTIONS If the latest push for peace
talks falls apart, U.S. officials may seek to distance America even
further from the Yemen war via punitive measures against Riyadh. Yet
while some of these potential measures are reversible options that offer
a good means of signaling displeasure, others would damage Saudi
Arabia's legitimate defensive efforts and may prove difficult to
reverse. Policymakers should be realistic about the minimal role that
U.S. forces actually play in directly supporting the war. Going forward,
Washington should limit itself to the following steps: Continue military
training missions. USMTM, OPM-SANG, and MoI-MAG are vital sources of
U.S. influence and access in Saudi Arabia and are highly valued by both
governments. Although this makes them very powerful cards to play, it
also underlines how going too far could undo half a century's worth of
defense diplomacy. These missions will never be a foolproof way of
preventing Riyadh from acting on its own perceived interests, but they
have served as a vital channel of high-level dialogue through dozens of
revolutions, wars, and energy crises. Continue advise-and-assist support
to defensive missions. According to Washington Institute data obtained
from research along the Saudi-Yemeni frontier, the kingdom has suffered
hundreds of fatalities each year from attacks on its Border Guards and
missile strikes on southern Saudi towns. The United States should
continue helping the Saudis defend their territory, including through
increased defensive aid to hard-hit border units. Keep advising Saudi
forces on lawful targeting. Critics correctly argue that Saudi Arabia is
not amending its targeting policies fast enough despite U.S. advice, but
that does not mean giving up is the correct solution. Preventing
additional civilian casualties is the most important contribution
Washington can make, and this effort should not be politicized. To put
more pressure on Riyadh without rescinding advisory support on targeting
policy, [the United States should condition future training and
advise/assist efforts on Saudi forces halting their airstrikes against
Houthi leadership targets and high-risk populated areas. Stop refueling
aircraft near Yemen]{.underline}. Although U.S. refueling support is not
critical to the overall Saudi air campaign, withholding it from aircraft
operating near the border might force Riyadh to reduce the number of
emerging targets it attacks in Sana and Saada, where airstrikes have
caused the worst civilian death tolls.

### Saudi Solvency

#### Arms relationships key to leverage

&gt;. Phops)

Eighteen months ago, Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia and said he had
concluded \$110 billion dollars in arms sales with the kingdom. It was
fake news then and it's still fake news today. The Saudis have not
concluded a single major arms deal with Washington on Trump's watch.
Nonetheless, [the U.S. arms relationship with the kingdom is the most
important leverage Washington]{.underline} has as it contemplates
reacting to the alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi. FOLLOW THE MONEY In
June 2017, after the president's visit to Riyadh---his first official
foreign travel---we published a Brookings blog post detailing that his
claims to have sold \$110 billion in weapons were spurious. Other media
outlets subsequently came to the same conclusion. When Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammad bin Salman visited the White House this year, the
president indirectly confirmed that non-deal by chiding the prince for
spending only "peanuts" on arms from America. The Saudis have continued
to buy spare parts, munitions, and technical support for the enormous
amount of American equipment they have bought from previous
administrations. [The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) is entirely dependent
on American and British support for its air fleet]{.underline} of F15
fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and Tornado aircraft. [If either
Washington or London halts the flow of logistics, the RSAF]{.underline}
will be grounded. The Saudi army and the Saudi Arabian National Guard
are similarly dependent on foreigners (the Saudi Arabian National Guard
is heavily dependent on Canada). The same is also true for the Saudis
allies like Bahrain. Under President Obama, Saudi Arabia spent well over
\$110 billion in U.S. weapons, including for aircraft, helicopters, and
air defense missiles. These deals were the largest in American history.
Saudi commentators routinely decried Obama for failing to protect Saudi
interests, but the kingdom loved his arms deals. But the kingdom has not
bought any new arms platform during the Trump administration. Only one
has even been seriously discussed: A \$15 billion deal for THAAD,
terminal high altitude area defense missiles, has gotten the most
attention and preliminary approval from Congress, but the Saudis let
pass a September deadline for the deal with Lockheed Martin. The Saudis
certainly need more air defenses with the pro-Iran Zaydi Shiite Houthi
rebels in Yemen firing ballistic missiles at Saudi cities. The three and
a half year-old Saudi war in [Yemen is hugely expensive]{.underline}.
There are no public figures from the Saudi government about the war's
costs, but a conservative estimate would be at least \$50 billion per
year. Maintenance costs for aircraft and warships go up dramatically
when they are constantly in combat operations. The Royal Saudi Navy has
been blockading Yemen for over 40 months. The RSAF has conducted
thousands of air strikes. [The war is draining the kingdom's
coffers]{.underline}. And responsibility for the war is on Mohammed bin
Salman, who as defense minister has driven Riyadh into this quagmire.
[Shaking the arms relationship is by far the most important way to clip
his wings.]{.underline} AVENGING KHASHOGGI Congress now has the power to
make a serious decision, halting arms sales and the logistics train for
the kingdom in the wake of the reported murder of Saudi critic Jamal
Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul Turkey last week. The
outrageous attack on Jamal deserves serious reaction, and given Trump's
dereliction of duty on the matter, it is up to Congress to act. The
president may try to override a Senate arms stand-down but it would be a
painful setback for the prince. Jamal's last opinion piece before his
death was about the war in Yemen. He called for an immediate Saudi
ceasefire and blamed the war on Mohammed bin Salman. At stake, Jamal
argued, is Saudi "dignity" and its role as a leader in the Islamic
world. It has rightly been seen as an ineffectual bully. Saudi Arabia's
war is alienating people around the world. Across the Muslim world, the
Saudi brand has been damaged. Khashoggi compared Mohammed bin Salman to
Syrian President Bashar Assad as a war criminal. His death only further
darkens Mohammed bin Salman's standing. Much of the world is likely to
treat him and his henchmen as pariahs. The prince's goal in Istanbul was
to intimidate any opposition or criticism no matter how peaceful. The
more blatant and gruesome the intimidation, the more likely it will
chill dissent. But it will also polarize the country and encourage the
deep conspiracies that could violently and suddenly change the kingdom
in very unexpected ways. These are very dangerous waters for the House
of Saud.

\$1.15 billion sale of Abrams tanks and other major defense articles to
Saudi Arabia in light of concerns about the kingdom's actions in Yemen.
In the House, more than 60 representatives signed a letter by Rep. Ted
Lieu to President Obama requesting [a delay in U.S. arms sales to
Riyadh]{.underline}. With opposition to arms sales to Saudi Arabia
growing, [the administration should use its leverage to encourage the
Saudi government to cease its indiscriminate bombing campaign and delay
future U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia until such change
occurs]{.underline}. The 18-month Saudi-led campaign in Yemen is
believed to have resulted in over 3,800 civilian deaths and more than
6,700 injuries. US-manufactured weapons are being used to carry out the
Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen, and strikes have hit civilian
targets, destroying schools, markets, hospitals, and factories. [The
United States is Saudi Arabia's largest weapons supplier]{.underline}
and it has provided logistical and intelligence support to the kingdom,
along with billions of dollars in heavy conventional weapons. The Obama
administration has prioritized Saudi Arabia's special relationship with
the United States and has requested a nominal \$10,000 per year for
International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance so that
Saudi Arabia can remain eligible for discounts on Foreign Military
Sales. Since 2009 alone, the administration has authorized over \$115
billion in sales of major conventional weapons to the Kingdom
--including munitions, tanks, and fighter jets. While proponents of
continued sales to Saudi Arabia provide numerous justifications, many of
those do not hold up. Indeed, the oft-heard refrain, "if we don't sell,
someone else will" is used repeatedly -- but [just because we can
doesn't mean we should]{.underline}. [Complicity in contributing to
human rights abuses and a massive humanitarian crisis is not in the U.S.
interest, even if the U.S. could lose sales]{.underline} (itself a
specious argument). If the Chinese or Russians want to sell weapons that
they know will be used to kill civilians, let them. [The United States
holds an estimable position and a certain moral authority when it comes
to the global arms trade -- in both its robust (and restrictive) arms
transfer control system and its attentiveness to potential risks -- and
should not negate its core principles when confronted with potential
competition.]{.underline} Congress rarely offers such a public critique
of potential U.S. arms transfers, particularly to a close ally. The last
time Congress successfully stopped an arms sale to Saudi Arabia was in
the early 1990s, when fallout from the Gulf War led lawmakers to oppose
a \$20 billion arms package to the kingdom (the sale was eventually
broken into smaller pieces; the transfer of some systems was postponed
indefinitely). [The administration already has the tools it needs to
encourage the Saudis to act]{.underline}. The use of U.S. weapons in
Yemen runs counter to the laws and regulations that underpin U.S. arms
transfers -- such as the Arms Export Control Act and Foreign Assistance
Act, Presidential Policy Directive 27, and its obligations as a
signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty. Congressional opposition shines a
bright light on Riyadh's conduct and increases pressure on the Obama
administration not to accept "business-as-usual" for U.S. arms sales.
The public display of disapproval takes important steps toward
condemning and shaming the Saudi government's behavior and encouraging a
change to the air campaign. Moreover, [if given the choice, governments
want to purchase U.S. weapons and systems, as they are better and more
effective systems. It's also possible that munitions manufactured by
other countries may not work in U.S. systems -- as they were not
designed for interoperability]{.underline}. [Saudi forces have
historically relied upon U.S. systems and are not trained on systems
from other countries.]{.underline} Concerns that delayed U.S. weapons
may impede Saudi Arabia's ability to defend itself also fall short. The
United States has sold billions of dollars in weapons to the Kingdom and
has a long record of working with the Saudis to ensure security for the
Kingdom and the region. That friendship and cooperation should not
justify continued U.S. complicity in prosecuting a war that is harming
civilians indiscriminately. As President Obama and his advisors consider
their legacy, it is time to stand up to those that violate human rights
with impunity. [Without a concerted and public effort to delay future
sales, the United States effectively legitimizes the Saudi government's
actions.]{.underline} Ultimately, the administration will need to make a
political decision to utilize its leverage to influence Saudi behavior
and better adhere to its own values and principles.

You know the [Trump]{.underline} administration['s]{.underline} [efforts
to salvage its approach toward Saudi Arabia are in trouble]{.underline}
when Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's closest allies,
threatens to shut down all Senate business over what he deems as a "not
acceptable" response that has him "pissed." And it might get worse this
weekend if President Donald Trump, as is his wont, ignores his advisors'
warnings and warmly embraces Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the
man who most likely gave the order to murder journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
at the G-20 summit in Argentina. The [Trump]{.underline} administration
[seems determined to stick with the erratic crown prince no matter
what]{.underline}, arguing that oil and money are more important than
protecting U.S. values. But despite Trump's wishes, it's clear that it
will be much harder, if not impossible, for Saudi Arabia to gain support
for arms sales or any other kind of assistance that requires approval
from the U.S. Congress. Finally, the crown prince will remain
politically radioactive---there is little chance he could make a
high-profile trip to the United States to be feted by the likes of Oprah
and Mark Zuckerberg anytime soon. Yet in the long term, perhaps the only
silver lining of this crisis is it is forcing the United States to
reassess the fundamental rationale of the relationship with Saudi Arabia
in a way it hasn't since the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, or,
before that, the 1973 oil shock. A common refrain in Congress has been
that there should be no more "business as usual." So [what should the
new business look like? It is tempting to file for a divorce, just as
Trump has gone all in on a full embrace. Yet that would be unwise.
Instead, the United States must offer Saudi Arabia's leaders a choice:
They visibly shift to policies defined by "three noes"---no further
intervention in Yemen, no more fighting with Qatar, and no more
surprises---or face a significant downgrade of the
relationship.]{.underline} Trump has already decided. Yet his
exclamation point-filled statement proclaiming the essentiality of the
relationship got it backward: The United States matters much more to
Saudi Arabia than Saudi Arabia does to the United States. The
administration claims it needs Saudi Arabia in order to counter Iran.
But [it is Saudi Arabia that needs the United States, not the other way
around]{.underline}. The United States is a global superpower that can
cope with a threat by a country halfway around the world with a GDP
similar in size to Maryland's. For Saudi Arabia, Iran is a country three
times its size right across the water with a long history of strategic
competition. So, who needs whom more? Then there is the economic
relationship. There's no need to shelve American values and bend to
Saudi requests because of their oil reserves. They're not going to stop
selling oil if Washington drops its patronage of Riyadh. It's in their
interest to sell oil, and the United States is better insulated from
fluctuations in the energy markets than it has ever been. [If the United
States needed Saudi Arabia that desperately, then Trump would certainly
not be picking trade fights with China and the European Union, whose
impact on the U.S. economy dwarf that of Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} Of
course, Saudi money can be good for the U.S. economy and helps the U.S.
defense industry. But it is not uniquely vital. One can only speculate
why Trump sticks to his mistaken assumptions---maybe it is his personal
financial interests, or his contrarian instincts, or the fact that most
of his views on geopolitics seem stuck in the 1970s and '80s, or simply
because the House of Saud's gilded, autocratic patriarchy feels very
familiar to the House of Trump. Whatever the reason, the green-light
policy has proved to be a failure. The United States has not ended up
with a close partner in the Middle East but with a rogue ally drawing
America into unnecessary quagmires and hurting its interests. The
question is what to do about it. It might feel good for the United
States to turn its back on the Saudis, but that won't enhance U.S.
interests or save lives. [The United States has leverage it must use,
but that has to be carefully estimated]{.underline}.

&gt;. Phops)

(Washington, DC) -- [The United States Senate should not approve two
proposed arms sales totaling nearly US\$1 billion to Bahrain given its
government's dismal record on human rights and relentless persecution of
dissidents.]{.underline} The proposed [arms sales,]{.underline} already
approved by the US State Department, [come amid the continued downward
spiral of human rights]{.underline} since anti-government demonstrations
in 2011, and Bahrain's continued participation in the Saudi-led Yemen
conflict that has contributed to one of the world's worst humanitarian
crises. In the past year, Bahrain has sharpened its crackdown on
activists, lawyers, and journalists. It has arbitrarily revoked a record
number of citizenships of nationals, carried out unfair trials of
civilians in military courts, and harassed, intimidated, imprisoned, and
prosecuted rights defenders and their family members. This is in
addition to widespread ill treatment and torture by security forces and
deadly dispersal of peaceful protests, since anti-government protests
erupted in 2011. "These two [weapons sales make clear that the Trump
administration intends nothing short of a free pass on human rights for
Bahrain]{.underline}" said Sarah Margon, Washington director at Human
Rights Watch. "[The US Senate should block all arms sales to Bahrain
until, at a minimum, they release all unjustly imprisoned human rights
defenders and dissidents, and make clear that a key US ally should not
continue in such mass human rights abuses."]{.underline} On April 27,
2018, the State Department approved the sale of AH-1Z attack
helicopters, missiles, and other military equipment to the kingdom, for
an estimated cost of US\$911.4 million. This deal comes on the heels of
President Donald Trump's revised policies for conventional arms
transfers and drone exports, signed on April 19, that place greater
emphasis on US economic interests than human rights. On May 17, the
State Department approved a second weapons' deal with Bahrain worth up
to US\$45 million, which included 3,200 bomb bodies to arm Bahrain's
F-16 fighters fleet. In both cases, the Senate was notified of the sales
and, under the Arms Export Control Act, has 30 days from the
notification date to oppose the deal. [There are significant human
rights concerns in both Bahrain's behavior domestically and its
participation in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen]{.underline}, Human
Rights Watch said. The US should hold off on all arms sales to Bahrain
until authorities show they are serious about addressing human rights
concerns. That should include releasing all human rights defenders and
dissidents serving long jail terms for peaceful expression, and holding
accountable officials and security officers who participating in or
ordered the widespread torture during interrogations since 2011. In an
early demonstration of the Trump administration's policy toward human
rights and arms sales, in March 2017, then-Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson lifted the human rights conditions that the Obama
administration had attached to a sale to Bahrain of F-16 fighter jets
worth US\$2.8 billion. In June 2017, Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Bob Corker announced that he would hold up all newly announced
arms sales to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations until the council
found a path to reunification in a dispute between Qatar and other
countries. Corker lifted that hold eight months later, in February 2018,
allowing for these two sales to Bahrain to proceed, and has said that he
does not believe that human rights conditions should be attached to
weapons sales as a matter of US policy. The Saudi-led coalition and
party to the conflict in Yemen, has since 2015 conducted thousands of
airstrikes in Yemen -- including scores that appear to violate the laws
of war -- contributing to one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
The coalition has failed to credibly investigate potential war crimes,
and coalition members, including Bahrain, have provided insufficient or
no information about their role in alleged unlawful attacks. Available
information shows that Bahrain has participated in the military
campaign. In March 2015, the Emirati State news agency reported that
Bahrain had deployed 15 aircraft to take part in coalition operations
and, in December 2015, a Bahraini F-16 jet carrying out coalition
operations crashed in Saudi Arabia, the coalition said in a statement.
The human rights situation in Bahrain continues to deteriorate as the
government increased a crackdown on critics. The country's preeminent
human rights defenders were either jailed or exiled as the judicial
authorities handed down long prison sentences to dissidents accused of
speech crimes in trials that did not meet basic due process standards.
The government failed to credibly investigate and prosecute officials
and police officers who allegedly committed violations, including
torture since 2011. Authorities also use excessive and deadly force to
disperse peaceful protests, and forcibly disappear people, and hold them
in incommunicado detention. On May 25, 2017, security forces apparently
violently raided a sit-in in the village of Diraz. Five demonstrators
died and dozens more were injured. Bahraini authorities have, since
2012, arbitrarily revoked the citizenship of at least 728 citizens,
including human rights defenders, political activists, journalists, and
religious scholars, and subjected some of them to arbitrary
deportations, according to the Bahrain Institute for Rights and
Democracy (BIRD), a nongovernmental organization. The vast majority of
Bahraini citizens stripped of their citizenship are left effectively
stateless and are not given adequate opportunity to meaningfully appeal
these rulings. Authorities in 2017 shut down the country's only
independent newspaper and suspended the activities of the leading
secular-left opposition political group Wa'ad. On May 13, 2018,
Bahrain's parliament approved a law barring members of dissolved
opposition groups from running in general elections planned for the end
of 2018. The Bahraini government also reversed two of the few previously
implemented substantive recommendations of the Bahrain Independent
Commission of Inquiry (BICI), was established after the 2011
anti-government demonstrations. Authorities in January 2017 restored
arrest and investigation powers to the National Security Agency, despite
its record of torture during interrogation. And in April 2017, Bahrain's
ruler signed legislation authorizing the trial of civilians before
military courts, which contravenes international law. ["Bahrain's
backsliding on human rights should not be rewarded with arms sales that
could further entrench repression in Bahrain]{.underline}," Margon said.

WASHINGTON --- **America's top defense firms will face limited financial
risks in their dealings with Saudi Arabia, even as lawmakers consider
imposing limits** on arms sales to the kingdom, according to analysts at
Cowen Research. "It would appear that [these would be limited in
duration and scope, and big-ticket buys of missile defense systems would
not be impacted]{.underline}," the analysts wrote in the note. Of the
major defense suppliers, [Lockheed Martin would have the most exposure,
according to the note, but it would still amount to a relatively tiny
portion of the company's business.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia's oil-rich
monarchy is one of America's most strategic partners and a significant
patron of U.S. defense companies. The Saudis are the indisputable top
buyers of U.S.-made arms, a title that has safeguarded the kingdom from
retaliatory sanctions over the disappearance of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi and the Saudi-led war in Yemen. President Donald Trump has
often cited the importance of the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia,
repeatedly pushing back on approving significant economic or political
consequences for Riyadh's actions. In an extraordinary statement last
week, Trump affirmed that the U.S. would continue to stand with Saudi
Arabia. Trump has also commented on the potential impact to defense
suppliers if the U.S. were to sanction the Saudis over the Khashoggi
killing. "I tell you what I don't want to do," Trump said to CBS' "60
Minutes" last month, when he was asked about possibly blocking arms
sales to Riyadh. "Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these \[companies\]. I
don't want to hurt jobs. I don't want to lose an order like that. There
are other ways of punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word,
but it's true." However, if Congress imposed short-term restrictions on
Saudi weapons sales the resulting impact looks to be less than 2 percent
of sales for Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing and General Dynamics, and
negligible for Northrop Grumman. Here's a breakdown of what top defense
firms are selling to Saudi Arabia and which contracts are at risk.
Lockheed Martin has the broadest Saudi exposure From missiles to
helicopters, the Pentagon's top weapons supplier is selling a range of
arms to Saudi Arabia. Of the top five U.S.-based arms makers, Lockheed
Martin has the broadest Saudi exposure and is slated to bring in \$400
million this year from Saudi sales alone. Next year, Lockheed Martin is
expected to rack up approximately \$900 million in sales to the kingdom.
In a deal reportedly worth \$15 billion, the Bethesda-based defense firm
is marching toward selling Saudi Arabia the THAAD, or terminal high
altitude area defense, missile system. Regarded as America's crown jewel
in missile defense systems, THAAD is manufactured by Lockheed Martin but
uses a radar supplied by Raytheon. In addition to THAAD, the kingdom
looks to buy Pac-3 missiles, Black Hawk helicopters, munitions, C-130
aircraft and littoral combat ships. [In short,]{.underline} according to
the note, [Lockheed Martin's at-risk defense sales to Saudi will likely
be less than 1.5 percent of its total in 2019.]{.underline} Raytheon is
the largest Saudi supplier in defensive systems [While Raytheon remains
the largest Saudi supplier, the defense giant sells mostly air and
missile defense equipment, which means the sales would go on unopposed
by Congress.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia wants the Patriot missile system,
the TYP-2 radar used by Lockheed Martin's THAAD missile system, and
missile interceptors from Raytheon. The defense firm has said that sales
to Saudi Arabia are slightly less than 5 percent of this year's total.
The figures are expected to remain consistent in 2019. According to the
note, the Saudi sales that are at risk are munitions and missiles. The
at-risk ticket items account for approximately \$500 million, or less
than 2 percent, of Raytheon's total. Boeing sales are significant but
declining Similar to Lockheed Martin, Boeing sells a range of weapons to
Saudi Arabia. The world's largest aerospace company is on order to
deliver F-15 jets, Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as a plethora
of munitions to the Saudis. [Boeing "likely has the largest absolute
level of sales]{.underline}" to Saudi Arabia, at approximately \$1.7
billion, according to the note. Cowen analysts write that Boeing's
largest program, the F-15 jets reportedly worth more than \$1 billion,
is nearing completion and sales taper off in 2019. "Furthermore, [given
Boeing's large commercial volume, Boeing's Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
defense sales are only approximately 1.5 percent of its
total]{.underline}," according to the note. [General Dynamics sales are
concentrated and stable]{.underline} General Dynamics has a multiyear
contract with Saudi Arabia for the delivery of 100 Abrams tanks as well
as a Canadian vehicle contract. America's stalwart M1 Abrams has been
used in nearly every major U.S. conflict since its inception in 1980 and
serves as the main battle tank of the U.S. Army and Marines. The Abrams
deal with the Saudis is estimated to bring in \$1.3 billion. Meanwhile,
the Canadian vehicle contract extends to 2024 and looks to add \$5.9
billion.

[U.S. export deals are undermining regional stability and sending jobs
abroad.]{.underline} President Trump's love of arms sales is clear for
all to see. On his first trip abroad as a public servant, the new
president proudly announced a mammoth arms deal with Saudi Arabia, later
crowing that the deal would lead to one million new American jobs. Last
July, his administration released a new Conventional Arms Transfer
policy that aims to streamline and supercharge arms exports through a
whole-of-government strategy. The results so far, according to figures
from a new report from the Security Assistance Monitor, have been \$82.2
billion in arms sales in 2017 and another \$78 billion in 2018.
Unfortunately, Trump's promises about the benefits of arms sales are
mostly empty, while [the dangers are all too real]{.underline}.
[Advocates of arms exports have long argued that such sales are critical
for promoting regional stability]{.underline} in trouble spots around
the world. But [American arms exports to the Middle East are doing the
exact opposite]{.underline}. Arms export data from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute show that the U.S. share of [arms
sales to the Middle East has steadily increased over the past 15 years,
yet]{.underline} with conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and throughout North
Africa, [the region is as unstable as ever]{.underline}. American arms
sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have already enabled
those nations to carry out a bloody and catastrophic war in Yemen, which
has killed thousands of civilians, displaced most of the population, and
put millions more at risk of starvation and disease. By continuing to
sell weapons to Saudi Arabia even after attempts in the U.S. Senate to
halt them, the Trump administration will encourage more Saudi
intervention, further destabilizing the region. And though presidents
tout export of arms as a good way to strengthen allies, [the truth is
that the United States doesn't just sell weapons to responsible
nations]{.underline} such as Italy, the United Kingdom, and Belgium.
Vast amounts of U.S. weapons are shipped to risky customers: fragile
states like Turkey, nations embroiled in conflicts like Saudi Arabia,
and oppressive governments with horrendous human rights records like
Egypt, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. Since 2001, the U.S.
government has notified the public of arms sales totaling over \$560
billion to 167 countries. [Each]{.underline} of these [sales adds a
varying degree of risk to the United States regarding potential
blowback, entanglement, dispersion, and increasing
instability]{.underline} throughout the world. Finally, Trump's claims
about the economic benefits of arms sales ring the hollowest of all. For
starters, not only won't arms sales create a million new American jobs,
but a great number of the jobs created by arms sales will go to citizens
of the purchasing nations. As the Security Assistance Monitor report
notes, the number of licenses granted to weapons manufacturers outside
the United States doubled from 2017 to 2018. As a result, more than
one-quarter of all U.S. arms "sales" last year were deals to permit the
manufacturing of U.S.-designed weapons under license --- that is, they
created jobs in other nations instead of the United States. The report
also finds that the Trump administration has sharply increased the
number of deals in which foreign countries produce U.S.-developed
weaponry under coproduction agreements, further reducing the number of
U.S. jobs tied to arms sales. Weakening the economic rationale even
further is the fact that in order to seal major deals, American defense
contractors have to offer massive discounts, or offsets, to the
purchasing nations in the form of coproduction arrangements or
technology transfer. In 2014, for example, these offsets equaled roughly
one-third of the value of total U.S. arms sales. These offsets mean not
only that American arms sales are less profitable than they appear on
paper, but also that they lead to fewer jobs created in the United
States than many, including the president, would like to think. Trump's
big Saudi arms deal, for example, would likely lead to somewhere between
20,000 and 40,000 jobs, or less than two-tenths of one percent of the
American labor market. The unpleasant truth is that the underwhelming
economic benefits cannot justify Washington's love of arms sales. Arms
sales simply do not benefit the U.S. economy nearly as much as Trump
likes to claim. Meanwhile, [a large percentage of American arms sales
goes to countries with horrible human rights records, to nations where
arms are at risk of finding their way into the wrong hands, and to
nations embroiled in dangerous and destabilizing
conflicts. ]{.underline}Given this, it is long past time to rethink
American arms sales policy.

March 27 (UPI) \-- [Selling lethal weapons to Ukraine is the equivalent
of pouring kerosene onto a flame]{.underline}. But ongoing hostilities
between Ukraine and Russia \-- including the Kerch strait crisis, which
began late last year when Russia intercepted three Ukrainian vessels and
took 24 crew members captive \-- are also a major business opportunity
for the world\'s largest defense contractors. Despite the risk of
serious escalation, these [companies continue to provide Ukraine with
lethal aid so it can defend itself against Russia \-- for a price, of
course.]{.underline} The U.S. special representative for Ukraine
negotiations, Kurt Volker, stated recently that [Washington remains

anti-tank systems]{.underline}. He even hinted that the United States is
considering expanding the types of lethal aid that it could begin
selling to Ukraine, saying: \"We also need to be looking at things like
air defense and coastal defense.\" This is a troubling prospect. In
March, U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti said that [the United States
could also bolster the Ukrainian military\'s sniper
capabilities]{.underline}. Speaking to the Senate Armed Services
Committee, he said: \"There are other systems, sniper systems,
ammunition and, perhaps looking at the Kerch Strait, perhaps
consideration for naval systems, as well, here in the future as we move
forward.\" This comment has been widely underreported and has not
received nearly as much attention as it deserves considering the
potential consequences. At worst, [more lethal aid could escalate the
conflict further.]{.underline} At [best, it will continue to keep alive
a conflict that has killed more than 10,000. Finding a straightforward
policy alternative is difficult, but sending more lethal aid to achieve
the unattainable goal of Ukraine defeating Russia is certainly no
solution.]{.underline} Impact Despite attempts by Volker and Scaparrotti
to market the proposition as a way to help Ukraine defend itself against
Russia, the immediate benefits seem clearer to America\'s weapons
manufacturing sector than to Ukrainian civilians, who will undoubtedly
get caught in the cross-fire. The Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute reported that the United States is home to five of the
world\'s 10 largest defense contractors. Lockheed Martin, by far the
largest in the field, in 2017 had an estimated \$44.9 billion in arms
contracts globally. The company was also contracted (with Raytheon) in
2018 to provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles. The U.S.
Pentagon said: \"The Javelin system will help Ukraine build its
long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial
integrity in order to meet its national defense requirements.\" But
Lockheed Martin likely profited handsomely from the deal. Meanwhile, the
company\'s financial reports showed fourth quarter 2018 net sales of
\$14.4 billion, compared to \$13.8 billion in the fourth quarter of
2017. This year, the company is expecting sales to grow by as much as 6
percent. This is unlikely to be the case if the number of conflicts
around the world declines. It\'s clear why Washington wants to sell more
weapons to Ukraine. But whether Ukraine remains receptive and willing to
continue buying them may hinge on the outcome of the upcoming
presidential election, which is scheduled for Sunday. Presidential
candidate Volodymyr Zelensky, who is leading in the polls, seems to
offer hope that Ukraine may change its current strategy. This is
reflected in a statement Zelensky made in March in which he emphasized
the need to negotiate with Russia in order to \"save people\'s lives.\"
Is there a solution? As well as better diplomacy, Zelensky also sees
[direct democracy as a way to resolve the crisis. Rather than pursuing
the same ineffective policy]{.underline}, which has achieved absolutely
nothing except for a greater death toll and growing human misery, he
proposed a referendum on the outcome of his negotiations with Russia on
the conflict in eastern Ukraine. This approach might not lead to a quick
fix or immediately restore peace in the region \-- but [it is more
likely to succeed than simply supplying more weapons with which to
prolong the fighting.]{.underline} The West should not abandon its
rhetoric of support for Ukraine\'s territorial integrity. But
policymakers and society more broadly should be careful not to assume
that simply selling more weapons to Ukraine will yield a definitive
victory over Russia and its separatist allies. While the ongoing war in
the the eastern Donbas region and the recent Kerch incident offer an
opportunity for big businesses to make a profit[, it\'s ordinary people
who will pay the price. The current approach to de-escalating the
conflict needs to be dramatically re-evaluated \-- and lethal weapons
must be taken off the negotiating table.]{.underline}

&gt;. Phops)

It's been a very bad month for Washington's relations with Moscow,
culminating in the Trump administration's ill-advised decision to
authorize the commercial sale of "defensive" weapons to Ukraine.  The
flippant comment that Secretary of Defense James Mattis expressed
earlier in Kiev apparently summarizes the administration's attitude.
According to Mattis, "defensive weapons are not provocative unless you
are an aggressor, and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor." The reality
is that given the already lengthy record of U.S. meddling in Ukraine,
especially encouraging the demonstrators who overthrew the country's
pro-Russian elected president in 2014, moving to arm Ukraine is
extremely provocative. That country not only is in Russia's sphere of
influence, it is the single most important entity in Russia's core
security zone. The Ukraine arms sale came on the heels of the release of
newly de-classified documents confirming that U.S. leaders assured
Russia in 1990 that NATO would not expand beyond the eastern border of a
united Germany. For years, U.S. officials and their defenders in the
foreign policy community and the mainstream media insisted that no such
firm commitment had been given. And there was no evidence of a written
agreement. The new revelations, though, should effectively torpedo that
disingenuous defense. It is now clear that assurances were given, and
that Washington's subsequent moves to expand NATO severely damaged trust
between the two countries. President Trump's announcement of a new U.S.
national security strategy likely added to Moscow's irritation. It
proclaims that both China and Russia are "strategic competitors" of the
United States. The president's speech also contained allegations of
specific Russian misdeeds, ranging from the annexation of Crimea to
efforts to split the Western alliance, to meddling in the internal
political affairs of other countries. Those actions supposedly pose a
serious threat to America's security and well-being. The document's
language was disturbingly reminiscent of Washington's harsh,
confrontational rhetoric throughout the Cold War. [Approving even a
limited arms sale to Ukraine, given the context of those other
developments, was especially maladroit]{.underline}. A secessionist war
in the eastern portion of the country has simmered since 2014. Russia
backs the rebels and even has unofficially deployed its own forces at
times in the conflict zone. The situation in eastern Ukraine remains
extremely tense and volatile, despite the signing of the so-called Minsk
Agreement designed to dampen the fighting. [Washington's authorization
of weapons sales]{.underline} to Kiev [risks destabilizing a very
delicate situation]{.underline}. [It will encourage hardliners in the
Ukrainian government to press for a military victory in the belief that
additional, even more lethal, U.S. backing may be
forthcoming]{.underline}. But the military option for Ukraine is a
dangerous illusion. Given Russia's crucial security stakes in not having
another U.S. military client on its border, it is unlikely that the
Kremlin will tolerate the complete destruction of insurgent forces in
Ukraine's east. [Russian officials are already unhappy about having a
NATO presence, including troops and heavy weapons, in the Baltic
republics and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.]{.underline} Those leaders
consider Ukraine even more vital to their country's security. Trump's
decision on the arms sale is the latest blow to American foreign policy
realists who believed his comments during the 2016 presidential campaign
that he wanted to repair relations with Moscow. It's possible that the
virulent accusations from domestic political opponents about Russian
interference in the election has intimidated the president into trying
to shore-up his national security and anti-Russia credentials with this
move. Hawks in both the Democratic and Republican parties have pushed
for weapons sales to Ukraine for years, so that was a logical measure to
placate them. Whatever the reason, though, it is a step in the wrong
direction. If the United States is to avoid deepening an already severe
chill in relations with Moscow, U.S. leaders must acknowledge that
Russia will insist on a sphere of influence in its immediate
neighborhood and deeply resent Western intrusion into that sphere.
Unfortunately, American policymakers seem oblivious to the long-standing
reality in international affairs that all great powers tend to behave
that way. Such a denial of reality is not unique to the Trump
administration. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of
State John Kerry explicitly denounced the concept of spheres of
influence, especially with respect to Russia. It is a dangerously myopic
view. [Washington needs to proceed with far greater caution than it has
displayed to this point regarding its actions in the vicinity of other
major powers]{.underline}.  The Trump administration's decision [to
approve arms sales to Ukraine is akin to pouring gasoline on an already
simmering fire. Relations with Russia are tense enoug]{.underline}h
without such a needlessly antagonistic step.

### 2AC Taiwan delays bad

#### Delaying sales undermines regional security cooperation

&gt;. Phops)

[The delay]{.underline} we have seen [in approving arms sales to Taiwan
over the past few years is undermining U.S. interests.]{.underline} All
told, the United States has not approved new arms for Taiwan since
December 2015. The Obama administration was considering a modest package
in late 2016, but after Hillary Clinton lost the election, the
administration chose not to go forward with it. Now, despite early
indications that the Trump administration was considering a more robust
package of arms, no notification has been made to Congress. As
president-elect, Donald Trump conducted an unprecedented phone
conversation with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. Many interpreted this
as an indication the new administration would pursue a friendlier
approach toward Taipei. However, after Trump's Mar-a-Lago summit with
Chinese President Xi Jinping, the administration's tone has changed. In
an interview with Reuters, Trump was asked about another call with Tsai.
Trump replied that he had "a very good relationship with President Xi...
and would want to speak to him first." This indicated that relations
with Taiwan would be constrained by Trump's hope for Chinese cooperation
on North Korea. No previous administration had made such a trade off
between our Taiwan and North Korean interests. Recognizing how such a
linkage damages U.S. credibility, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis
subsequently included in his address to the Shangri-La Dialogue a clear
restatement of our commitment to supply Taiwan with defense articles in
keeping with the Taiwan Relations Act. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
has reassured the Congress that the U.S. intends to keep its commitments
to Taiwan. There is no doubt that [Taiwan requires additional defense
articles]{.underline}. What should be sold is a matter of debate, but
the fundamental fact is that [the]{.underline} People's Liberation
Army's ([PLA) capabilities against Taiwan continue to expand. The PLA
defense budget is now about 14 times larger than Taiwan's]{.underline}.
The Department of Defense's 2017 report on security developments in the
PRC concludes that, despite Taipei's defense improvements, the defensive
advantages Taiwan has enjoyed are declining. [Delaying arms sales to
Taiwan is one issue that is undermining regional confidence in the
United States. The delay is part of a pattern of actions or inactions by
the Trump administration that has weakened U.S. credibility in
Asia.]{.underline} That is why Mattis had to make so many specific
reassuring statements in his address in Singapore. Nevertheless, there
is uncertainty about whether those words will be implemented or
overruled by the president, as has happened on other issues.
Consequently, the notification to Congress of new arms sales is
essential to putting these doubts to rest. In the meantime, [inaction
feeds uncertainty]{.underline}. Since President Trump tweeted about "one
China" last December, the Taiwan media has been full of commentary
questioning whether the United States is reliable. Not surprisingly, the
pro-PRC media has argued that, since Trump will treat Taiwan as a
bargaining chip, it is foolish for Taiwan to rely on the United States
and that greater accommodation with Beijing is required. Even some
commentators well disposed toward the United States have said that the
more volatile environment under Trump is a new reality. The delay in
announcing new arms sales has been cited as evidence of Washington's
declining reliability. Taiwan's 2017 Ministry of Defense Quadrennial
Defense Report released in May stated for the first time that U.S.
policy toward Taiwan "remains to be seen." Trump's belief that his good
relations with Xi require him to consult Beijing about Taiwan is based
on a flawed understanding of China. China respects power and a
consistent commitment to one's principles. Consequently, successive U.S.
administrations have sought to convince Beijing that the peaceful
settlement of cross-strait differences is a matter of principle for the
United States. The tradeoff of one U.S. interest for another will only
lead Beijing to conclude that the Washington does not have any
principles. By indicating that relations with Taiwan can be traded away
for Beijing's support on North Korea, Trump has damaged the U.S.
interest with respect to maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. The
delays in arms sales decisions could be avoided if the U.S. government
adopted a practice of regularly approving sales rather than accumulating
items into packages that are more politically sensitive to Beijing.
Although the wisdom of this has been recognized both in and out of
government for at least two decades, successive administrations have
been unable to implement regular approvals. Given the president's
penchant for changing his views and given the uncertainty of who can
speak with authority for his administration, it is truer than ever that
action speaks louder than words. [An early notification of new arms for
Taiwan is necessary to put to rest doubts that are undermining the
credibility of U.S. support for Taiwan's security.]{.underline}

The Senate's failure to override President Trump's veto of its effort to
end U[.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen]{.underline}
is not the end of the story. A way can and must be found to stop U.S.
assistance in refueling, targeting, and other activities that bolster
the Saudi/United Arab Emirats (UAE) war effort, which [has killed tens
of thousands of civilians and left millions of Yemenis at risk of famine
and fatal, war-induced diseases.]{.underline} For starters, [Congress
should work to close off]{.underline} the other main avenue of U.S.
support for the Saudi-led coalition---[the sale of bombs, combat
aircraft, armored vehicles, attack helicopters, and other equipment to
Saudi Arabia and the UAE]{.underline}, the two primary perpetrators of
the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. According to statistics from the
Security Assistance Monitor, the United States has offered over \$68
billion in weaponry to those two nations since the start of the current
Yemen conflict in March 2015. As Bruce Riedel of the Brookings
Institution has noted, these [U.S.-supplied systems are the backbone of
the Saudi military, and without those weapons and related maintenance
and support they could not sustain their intervention in
Yemen.]{.underline} The Trump administration, the U.S. arms industry,
and the Saudi and UAE lobbies have made numerous arguments in favor of
keeping U.S. weapons flowing to its Gulf allies, but none of them holds
up to scrutiny. With respect to the sales of precision-guided
bombs---whose use has been documented in the widespread killings of
civilians---the argument of choice has been that even more civilians
would die in Saudi/UAE air strikes if the coalition were limited to
"dumb" bombs that could not be targeted as accurately. This assertion is
premised on the idea that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are making good faith
efforts to avoid hitting civilians. The sheer volume of strikes on
targets like hospitals, a school bus, funerals, factories, water
treatment plants, and other civilian infrastructure puts the lie to this
argument. [Air strikes on civilians are not "mistakes." They are part
and parcel of the Saudi/UAE strategy to bomb Yemenis into submission and
end the war on terms favorable to their coalition.]{.underline} Another
popular argument for continuing arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE
is "if we don't do it, somebody else will." But [the United
States]{.underline} and its European allies [supply the Saudi air force
and the majority of the arsenals of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The
Saudi and UAE militaries could not turn on a dime and seek Russian or
Chinese systems]{.underline} to substitute for any cutoff of U.S.
weaponry and support. [It would take a decade or more for these nations
to end their dependence on U.S. arms]{.underline}. [A few deals with
Moscow or Beijing would have limited impact on Saudi and UAE military
capabilities, if Russia and China were even willing to supply
arms]{.underline} to two nations that are responsible for the world's
worst humanitarian catastrophe, with the international opprobrium that
would accompany any decision to do so. President Trump's favorite
argument for keeping the weapons trade going is jobs, jobs, jobs. His
claims of U.S. jobs tied to Saudi arms sales and related deals have
fluctuated widely, from 40,000 to as many as one million. But an
analysis of actual deals concluded over the past two years suggests a
figure that is a fraction of the president's claims. And many of these
jobs will be created in Saudi Arabia as part of that nation's goal of
having 50 percent of the value of its arms purchases produced in the
kingdom by 2030. Last but not least is the claim that stopping arms
sales to the Saudi/UAE coalition will aid Iran. But the Houthi-led
opposition is by no means a proxy for Tehran. They have longstanding
grievances that have nothing to do with Iran's limited military support
and would be fighting no matter what posture Iran takes towards the
conflict. If anything, the brutal Saudi/UAE intervention is driving the
Houthi coalition closer to Tehran. The best way to undercut Iranian
influence in Yemen is to support UN efforts to end the war. There are
several congressional initiatives to cut off U.S. arms to the Saudi/UAE
coalition, including a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Senators Robert
Menendez (D-NJ), Todd Young (R-IN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Lindsey
Graham (R-SC), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jack Reed (D-RI), and Chris Murphy
(D-CT). That measure would, among other things, stop sales of
precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia and the UAE for two years and
condition other sales of offensive weapons on an end to the targeting of
civilians and assurances that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will support the
free passage of humanitarian aid. And a bill sponsored by Rep Jim
McGovern (D-MA) would [immediately end all U.S. arms sales and military
aid to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. It's time for Congress to move on this
and other initiatives that would once and for all end U.S. support for
the slaughter in Yemen.

Earlier this month, a CNN investigation provided further evidence that
U.[S. military equipment has been transferred from Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) to a variety of militias, including some
linked to al-Qaeda]{.underline}. Given the additional scrutiny of
U.S.-Saudi relations since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
recent U.S. Senate and House resolutions on arms sales to Saudi Arabia,
and ongoing Saudi and Emirati tensions with neighbor Qatar, now is the
time for a full-scale review of U.S. arms sales to the Gulf region.
[There are clear rules against arms transfers to third parties. There
are also end-use monitoring requirements for U.S. arms exports, but
these checks are hardly universal]{.underline}. Given that at least some
of the equipment found in militia hands can be tied to U.S. arms sales,
[the Department of Defense, State Department, and Commerce Department
are clearly not adequately monitoring sales]{.underline}. (Which U.S.
agency is responsible for end-use checks depends on the type of sale
conducted.) The United States is the largest arms supplier to Saudi
Arabia and the UAE, two lucrative customers of the U.S. defense
industry. Saudi Arabia was the largest importer of U.S. arms, having
purchased \$112 billion in weapons from 2013 through 2017. The UAE was
the second-largest importer of U.S. arms in the same time span. Since
2009, over \$27 billion in weapons have been offered to the UAE in
thirty-two separate deals under the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales
program. These [arms sales continue, despite both countries' history of
diverting arms to favored militias]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia has been
purchasing weapons from third parties to pass on to allied governments
and groups at least since the 1970s, sometimes on behalf of the U.S.
government. Transparency International's Government Defense
Anti-Corruption Index ranks Saudi Arabia and the UAE in its high-risk
category for corruption, [with Saudi Arabia receiving a score of zero
out of four (zero being the worst) and the UAE receiving a score of one
for lacking a well-scrutinized process for arms export decisions that
aligns with international protocols.]{.underline}

[The line between the Yemen War and America's global war on terror is
not a long one]{.underline}. Congress authorized the president to use
military force against the perpetrators of the September 11th attacks.
Since then, military action has become a reflex rather than a rarity.
U.S. foreign policy since 2001 has been dominated by direct and indirect
intervention, ranging from outright invasion and occupation, as in Iraq
in 2003, to dozens of undeclared and unmonitored actions that might not
meet the legal definition of direct military action. [Trump's excesses
are an expansion of, rather than a departure from, the practices of his
predecessors.]{.underline} Congress and public opinion have tended to
applaud military adventurism when they like its results and have avoided
confrontation with the executive branch even in cases where they
disapprove. [Endless war has successfully been sold as a public
necessity in a campaign against terrorism, even when U.S. military
action makes the world, and Americans, less safe.]{.underline} There
are, of course, real security threats, and counter-terrorism deservedly
is a high priority for American officials---including in Yemen. An
effective counter-terrorism policy would move away from a military
paradigm toward a policing framework, in which the military supports a
policy that pursues terrorist networks much the same way that it pursues
organized crime syndicates. As the practice stands, the forever war it
has produced and perpetuates has corroded American values and behavior.
Malpractice abroad has bred contempt for our democratic values and a
hopelessness about the rule of law at home. Ideological frameworks used
to justify foreign intervention and mistreatment of civilians in
conflict zones have also been invoked at home. [Threat inflation and
demagoguery have helped fuel bigotry and xenophobia at
home.]{.underline} [Elected officials now risk their careers if they try
to openly address the tradeoff between security and rights. Ending the
United States' part in the Yemen campaign]{.underline} won't suddenly
bring an end to the American forever war. But it [would mark a turning
point---a decisive rejection of the reflex to sign onto any military
conflict with even the slightest connection to terrorism]{.underline}.
[The United States has a great many tools at its disposal beyond weapons
sales and direct engagement in hostilities. We can pursue our interests
in Yemen while avoiding extremes]{.underline}; and American
self-interest does not require it to fully reject its traditional allies
in the Gulf nor to actively join them in their worst excesses. A
rational assessment of that self-interest might now be possible.

As part of the reaction to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and as part of
the wider left-wing preference for siding with Iran instead of Saudi
Arabia, [progressives who were already thoroughly in favor of the Arms
Trade Treaty (ATT) are arguing that Western governments should ratify
it]{.underline}, or uphold it, in order to cut off arms sales to the
Saudis. [This is a terrible argument. First, the ATT isn't an answer
that its advocates have arrived at out of the blue. It's long been their
stock response to virtually anything in U.S. or Western foreign policy
that they find distasteful]{.underline}. They particularly disliked U.S.
support for and arms sales to Saudi Arabia -- partly because, as
progressives, they focus almost exclusively on the purported evils of
the West, partly because they follow former President Obama in his
foolhardy belief that Iran will be a constructive actor if only we are
nice to it, and partly because they are born ambulance chasers. Their
view is that, if it bleeds, it leads. That made the profitless Saudi war
in Yemen a natural focus for their activism. The Saudi murder of
Khashoggi has just given them another opportunity to push the bad idea
they have been pushing for years. Second, backing the ATT because you
dislike U.S. (or British, or French, or Canadian) arms sales to the
Saudis is like going into a restaurant and ordering everything on the
menu because you want the salad. [U.S. arms sales to the Saudis are a
policy. It might be a good policy, or it might be a bad
policy]{.underline} -- or it might be a bad policy that is nonetheless
better than the alternatives. [But it is nonetheless just a policy. The
ATT, on the other hand, is not a policy: it is a treaty. By signing onto
it, you are not simply responding to the Khashoggi murder, or to the
Yemen war: you are committing yourself to following the treaty's rules
in all future circumstances.]{.underline} You are ordering the whole
menu for the sake of the salad. Third, [if the ATT had existed over the
previous decades, and was interpreted as tightly as its advocates appear
to demand]{.underline}, it would have imperiled a lot of U.S. arms
transfers that almost everyone would today regard as sensible and
justifiable. U.S. military aid to Britain before the U.S. entered the
Second World War would be dubiously legal under the ATT, because the
British bombing campaign against Nazi Germany inflicted a lot more
civilian casualties than the Saudis have in Yemen. Same for U.S.
military aid to South Korea. Same for U.S. arms supplies to Bosnian
Muslims resisting Serbian aggression in the 1990s. Same for U.S. arms
supplies to rebels resisting the murderous Assad regime in Syria.
[Fourth, it is entirely possible that the U.S., British, and French arms
sales to the Saudis are in fact permissible under the ATT]{.underline}.
[That was the decision of the British High Court in 2017,]{.underline}
and while that decision was not a slam dunk, it implies that [the ATT is
so loose that it does not actually ban much of anythin]{.underline}g. So
[the ATT is the worst of all worlds: it might ban nothing at all, or it
might ban a lot of things, or it might just ban things that become
unpopular]{.underline} with the left. In practice, therefore, [it's not
a treaty: it's a political mechanism for achieving particular
outcomes]{.underline}, which is precisely how it's being used today.
Funny -- I thought the left was concerned about the fate of the liberal
international order. Well, treaties that act like treaties -- in other
words, that are agreed, predictable, and enforced -- are part of that
order. But in practice, the left is entirely willing to ditch the order
for the sake of getting what it wants. The bottom line is this: [if you
don't like U.S. arms sales to the Saudis, campaign to change the
policy.]{.underline} I don't agree with you, [but this is a reasonable
thing to argue about. But don't try to change the policy by committing
the U.S. -- or any other nation -- to a set of rules that might mean
everything, or nothing, or some things at some times and other things at
others.]{.underline} That isn't being responsible. It's creating an
instrument that, sooner or later, is going to be used to constrain U.S.
policy in ways that will make it harder for us to help people who
deserve and need our help. In other words, it is profoundly
irresponsible.

[On Friday, at the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association,
President Donald Trump announced that he was un-signing the Arms Trade
Treaty.]{.underline} As he put it, "[The United Nations will soon
receive a formal notice that America is rejecting this
treaty."]{.underline} He then pulled out a pen and, in front of the
entire audience, signed a message asking the Senate to end its
consideration of the treaty. I have followed the Arms Trade Treaty
closely since 2009, before the formal negotiations for it even began.
The treaty purports to require nations to regulate the conventional arms
trade. President Barack Obama signed it in 2013, but the U.S. never
ratified it. I have no doubt that the president has made the correct
decision---and no doubt that he will be hammered for it by the
progressive left, who loves to praise the treaty as much as it enjoys
blaming the United States. If you would like to read my argument against
the treaty, it's here. More importantly, the White House has released a
short statement explaining the president's decision. It is a model of
clarity and accuracy. I doubt that the treaty's friends will have any
time for it, but that is their loss. I would love to see them try to
rebut it. A few points about the White House's statement: It notes that
[the Arms Trade Treaty is "being opened for amendment in 2020 and there
are potential proposals that the United States cannot
support]{.underline}." That is correct. The main such [proposal was
floated last summer at another U.N. gathering on conventional arms. It
involves bringing ammunition fully into the Arms Trade Treaty, meaning
that the U.S. would have to track or trace the billions of bullets that
are sold internationally]{.underline}. The U.S. opposed this last summer
because it is utterly impractical. The White House states that the
treaty provides "a platform for those who would seek to constrain our
ability to sell arms to our allies and partners." That is true.
Virtually every activist supporting the Arms Trade Treaty proclaims, at
the top of their lungs, that it is about stopping U.S. arms sales. It
points out that the treaty has "a track record of ... being used by
groups to try and overturn sovereign national decisions on arms
exports." That is quite right. The statement notes that the British
government---which, idiotically, led the push for the Arms Trade
Treaty---has gotten its just desserts by being repeatedly sued by
activists in the name of the treaty. In its only mention of the Second
Amendment, the White House states that, by un-signing, the president has
ensured that the treaty "will not become a platform to threaten
Americans' Second Amendment rights." The treaty's supporters love to
argue that it has nothing to do with curbing the Second Amendment. What
they don't mention is that many opponents of the treaty---myself
included---urged them privately to make that clear in the treaty text.
They refused to do so. The treaty is not a gun grab, but it is precisely
what the White House says it is: a platform that gun control activists
could potentially do great damage with. Finally, the White House notes
that [major arms exporters like Russia and China are not in the Arms
Trade Treaty, and that "\[t\]he \[treaty\] cannot achieve its chief
objective of addressing irresponsible arms transfers if these major arms
exporters are not subject to it at all]{.underline}." That is precisely
what the Obama administration said as far back as 2010. It is also
indisputably true. I could not have written the White House's statement
any better. It is a slam dunk. I commend the White House for its
decision, and for explaining it effectively and correctly. This is not
the end of the story of the Arms Trade Treaty. It still has 101 state
parties around the world. The U.S. needs to follow up this decision to
un-sign by pulling all U.S. funding from the treaty. And there are other
bad treaties and institutions of the same type as the Arms Trade Treaty.
We should quit them, too. Most fundamentally, while it's excellent to
quit bad treaties, it's even better not to let them get made in the
first place. Far too often, the U.S. finds itself in the position of a
hockey goaltender, who just has to stand there and stop shots. If you
just let the other guy keep shooting, sooner or later you're going to
get scored on. We need to take hold of the puck, skate down the ice, and
put some pressure on the other side. But first things first. The White
House has made the right call on the Arms Trade Treaty, and it's made
the right call for the right reasons.

Managing the Balance of Power: The Illusion of Control. [The hidden
assumption underlying the balance of power strategy is that the United
States will be able to predict accurately what the impact of its arms
sales will be]{.underline}. If the goal is deterrence, for example, the
assumption is that an arms sale will be sufficient to deter the
adversary without spawning an arms race. If the goal is to promote
stability, the assumption is that an arms sale will in fact reduce
tensions and inhibit conflict rather than inflame tensions and help
initiate conflict. These [assumptions]{.underline}, in turn, [depend on
both the recipient nation and that nation's neighbors and adversaries
acting in ways that don't make things worse.]{.underline} As it turns
out, these are often poor assumptions. Although arms sales certainly
enhance the military capability of the recipient nation, [the
fundamental problem is that arms sales often initiate a long chain of
responses that the United States generally cannot control. The United
States, after all, is not the only country with interests in regional
balances]{.underline}, especially where the survival and security of
local actors is at stake. [The United States is neither the only major
power with a]{.underline} keen [interest in critical regions like Asia
and the Middle East, nor the only source of weapons]{.underline} and
other forms of assistance. Nor can it dictate the perceptions,
interests, or actions of the other nations involved in a given region.
For example, though a nation receiving arms from the United States may
enjoy enhanced defensive capabilities, it is also likely to enjoy
enhanced offensive capabilities. With these, a nation's calculations
about the potential benefits of war, intervention abroad, or even the
use of force against its own population may shift decisively. Saudi
Arabia's recent behavior illustrates this dynamic. Though the Saudis
explain their arms purchases as necessary for defense against Iranian
pressure, Saudi Arabia has also spent the past two years embroiled in a
military intervention in Yemen. Likewise, [arms sales can heighten
regional security dilemmas]{.underline}. [Neighbors of nations buying
major conventional weapons will also worry about what this enhanced
military capability will mean]{.underline}. [This raises the chances
that they too will seek to arm themselves further, or take other steps
to shift the balance of power back in their favor]{.underline}, or, in
the extreme case, to [launch a preventive war before they are
attacked]{.underline}. Given these dynamics, the consequences of arms
sales to manage regional balances of power are far less predictable and
often much less positive than advocates assume.54 This unpredictability
characterizes even straightforward-seeming efforts to manage the balance
of power. The most basic claim of arms sales advocates is that U.S. arms
sales to friendly governments and allies should make them better able to
deter adversaries. The best available evidence, however, suggests a more
complicated reality. In a study of arms sales fro[m 1950 to 1995,
major-power arms sales to existing allies had no effect on the chance
that the recipient would be the target of a military
attack]{.underline}. Worse, [recipients of U.S. arms that were not
treaty allies were significantly more likely to become
targets]{.underline}.55 [Nor is there much evidence that arms sales can
help the United States promote peace and regional stability]{.underline}
by calibrating the local balance of power. On this score, in fact, the
evidence suggests that the default assumption should be the opposite.
Most scholarly work concludes that [arms sales exacerbate instability
and increase the likelihood of conflict]{.underline}.56 One study, for
example, found that during the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet [arms sales to
hostile dyads]{.underline} (e.g., India/Pakistan, Iran/Iraq,
Ethiopia/Somalia) "[contributed to hostile political relations and
imbalanced military relationships]{.underline}" and were "profoundly
destabilizing."57 There is also good reason to believe that several
factors are making the promotion of regional stability through arms
sales more difficult. [The shrinking U.S. military advantage
over]{.underline} other powers such as [China]{.underline} and the
increasingly competitive global arms market both [make it less likely
that U.S. arms sales can make a decisive difference]{.underline}. As
William Hartung argued as early as 1990, "the notion of using arms
transfers to maintain a carefully calibrated regional balance of power
seems increasingly archaic in today's arms market, in which a potential
U.S. adversary is as likely to be receiving weapons from U.S. allies
like Italy or France as it is from former or current adversaries."58 In
sum, the academic and historical evidence indicates that although the
United States can use arms sales to enhance the military capabilities of
other nations and thereby shift the local and regional balance of power,
its ability to dictate specific outcomes through such efforts is
severely limited. Arms for (Not That Much) Influence. Successful foreign
policy involves encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit
the United States. As noted, the United States has often attempted to
use arms sales to generate the sort of leverage or influence necessary
to do this. History reveals, however, that the benefits of the arms for
influence strategy are limited for two main reasons. First, the range of
cases in which arms sales can produce useful leverage is much narrower
than is often imagined. Most obviously, arms sales are unnecessary in
situations where the other country already agrees or complies with the
American position or can be encouraged to do so without such incentives.
This category includes most U.S. allies and close partners under many,
though not all, circumstances. Just as clearly, the arms for influence
strategy is a nonstarter when the other state will never agree to comply
with American demands. This category includes a small group of obvious
cases such as Russia, China, Iran, and other potential adversaries (to
which the United States does not sell weapons anyway), but it also
includes a much larger group of cases in which the other state opposes
what the United States wants, or in which complying with U.S. wishes
would be politically too dangerous for that state's leadership.59 In
addition, [there are some cases in which the United States itself would
view arms sales as an inappropriate tool.]{.underline} [The Leahy
Law]{.underline}, for example, [bars the United States from providing
security assistance to any specific foreign military unit deemed
responsible for past human rights abuses]{.underline}.60 More broadly,
arms sales are clearly a risky choice when the recipient state is a
failed state or when it is engaged in a civil conflict or interstate
war. Indeed, in such cases it is often unclear whether there is anyone
to negotiate with in the first place, and governments are at best on
shaky ground. At present the United States bars 17 such nations from
purchasing American arms. [As long as these nations are embargoed, arms
sales will remain an irrelevant option for exerting
influence]{.underline}.61

### Add on Internal Link -- Heg, Prolif, Commitment traps

#### Any arm sales increases Blowback, Entanglement and instability -- no enforcement after they comply - circumvention

Though [arms sales]{.underline} are of marginal value to national
security and the pursuit of national interests, their [negative
consequences are varied and often severe.]{.underline} [Arms sales can
spawn unwanted outcomes on three levels: blowback against the United
States and entanglement in conflicts; regional consequences in the
buyer's neighborhood, such as the dispersion of weapons and increased
instability; and consequences for the buyer itself, such as increased
levels of corruption, human rights abuses, and civil
conflict.]{.underline} Effects on the United States. Though the goal of
arms sales is to promote American security and U.S. interests abroad, at
least two possible outcomes can cause serious consequences for the
United States. The first of these --- [blowback --- occurs when a former
ally turns into an adversary and uses the weapons against the United
States]{.underline}. The second --- [entanglement --- is a process
whereby an arms sales relationship draws the United States into a
greater level of unwanted intervention.]{.underline} Blowback. The fact
that the United States has sold weapons to almost every nation on earth,
combined with frequent military intervention, means that [blowback is an
inescapable outcome of U.S. arms sales]{.underline} policy. [American
troops]{.underline} and their allies [have faced American-made weapons
in almost every military engagement since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}, including in Panama, Haiti, Somalia, Iraq,
Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. And even where the United States has not
yet engaged in combat, American [arms sales have bolstered the military
capabilities of adversaries once counted as friendly.]{.underline}
Blowback can occur in at least three ways. [First, a previously friendly
regime becomes unfriendly]{.underline}. For example, the United States
sold billions of dollars in weapons to the Shah of Iran during the 1970s
in the hopes that Iran would provide a stabilizing influence on the
Middle East. The sales included everything from fighter jets for air
campaigns to surface-to-air missiles to shoot down enemy fighters.70
After the 1979 revolution, however, Iran used those weapons in its war
with Iraq and enabled the new Iranian regime to exert its influence in
the region. Panama, the recipient of decades of American military
assistance, as well as host to a major military base and 9,000 U.S.
troops, was a similar case. In 1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega --- himself a
CIA asset for more than 20 years --- took power and threatened U.S.
citizens, prompting a U.S. invasion that featured American troops facing
American weapons.71 [Blowback also occurs when the United States sells
weapons to nations (or transfers them to nonstate actors) that, though
not allies, simply did not register as potential adversaries at the time
of the sale]{.underline}. The United States, for example, sold
surface-to-air missiles, towed guns, tanks, and armored personnel
carriers to Somalia during the 1980s. Few officials would have imagined
that the United States would find itself intervening in Somalia in 1992,
or that the United States and its allies would provide billions in
weapons and dual-use equipment to Iraq in an effort to balance against
Iran, only to wind up confronting Iraq on the battlefield to reverse its
annexation of Kuwait.72 And finally, [blowback can occur when U.S.
weapons are sold or stolen from the government that bought them and wind
up on the battlefield in the hands of the adversary]{.underline}. For
example, the Reagan administration covertly provided Stinger missiles to
the Mujahideen, who were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan during the
1980s; they in turn sold them off eventually to Iran and North Korea,
among others. More recently, the Islamic State managed to capture from
the Iraqi government a stunning number of Humvees and tanks the United
States had sold to Iraq to rebuild its military capabilities after the
2003 invasion, as well as enough small arms and ammunition to supply
three divisions of a conventional army.73 These examples of blowback
demonstrate how [difficult it can be to forecast the long-term outcomes
of arms sales and how obvious it is that selling weapons carries a
number of risks]{.underline}. Predicting what exactly will happen is
hard, but predicting that arms sales to clients with red flags are
likely to end badly is quite easy. Iraq was a fragile state ravaged by a
decade's worth of American intervention and rife with terrorism and
civil conflict; to transfer such large quantities of weapons to its
military and police force under such conditions was to invite disaster.
[Entanglement. Arms sales raise the risk of entanglement in two
ways.]{.underline} First, [they can represent early steps down the
slippery slope to unwise military intervention]{.underline}. Consider a
case like the Syrian civil war or the many cases during the Cold War in
which the United States wanted to support rebels and freedom fighters
against oppressive governments.74 In the majority of those cases,
American leaders were wary of intervening directly. Instead, the United
States tended to rely on money, training, and arms sales. But by taking
concrete steps like arms sales to support rebel groups, Washington's
psychological investment in the outcome tends to rise, as do the
political stakes for the president, who will be judged on whether his
efforts at support are successful or not. As we saw in the Syrian civil
war, for example, Barack Obama's early efforts to arm Syrian rebels were
roundly criticized as feckless, increasing pressure on him to intervene
more seriously.75 History does not provide much guidance about how
serious the risk of this form of entanglement might be. During the Cold
War, presidents from Nixon onward viewed arms sales as a substitute for
sending American troops to do battle with communist forces around the
world. The result was an astonishing amount of weaponry transferred or
sold to Third World nations, many of which were engaged in active
conflicts both external and internal. The risk of superpower conflict
made it dangerous to intervene directly; accordingly, the Cold War-era
risk of entanglement from arms sales was low.76 Today, however, the
United States does not face nearly as many constraints on its behavior,
as its track record of near-constant military intervention since the end
of the Cold War indicates. As a result, the risk of arms sales helping
trigger future military intervention is real, even if it cannot be
measured precisely. The second way in which arms sales might entangle
the United States is [by creating new disputes or exacerbating existing
tensions.]{.underline} U.S. arms sales to Kurdish units fighting in
Syria against the Islamic State, for example, have ignited tensions
between the United States and its NATO ally Turkey, which sees the Kurds
as a serious threat to Turkish sovereignty and stability.77 Meanwhile,
ongoing arms sales to NATO nations and to other allies like South Korea
and Taiwan have exacerbated tensions with Russia, China, and North
Korea, raising the risk of escalation and the possibility that the
United States might wind up involved in a direct conflict.78 Regional
Effects. [Arms sales]{.underline} do not just affect the recipient
nation; they also [affect the local balance of power]{.underline}, often
[causing ripple effects throughout the region]{.underline}. Though
advocates of arms sales trumpet their stabilizing influence, as we have
noted above, [arms sales often lead to greater tension, less stability,
and more conflict]{.underline}. Because of this --- and the
complementary problem of weapons dispersion --- the regional impact of
arms sales is less predictable and more problematic than advocates
acknowledge. Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First, arms sales can
make conflict more likely.79 This may occur because [recipients of new
weapons feel more confident about launching attacks or because changes
in the local balance of power can fuel tensions and promote preventive
strikes by others.]{.underline} A study of arms sales from 1950 to 1995,
for example, found that although arms sales appeared to have some
restraining effect on major-power allies, they had the opposite effect
in other cases, and concluded that "increased arms transfers from major
powers make states significantly more likely to be militarized dispute
initiators."80 Another study focused on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to
1997 found that "arms transfers are significant and positive predictors
of increased probability of war."81 Recent history provides supporting
evidence for these findings: since 2011, Saudi Arabia, the leading buyer
of American weapons, has intervened to varying degrees in Yemen,
Tunisia, Syria, and Qatar. Second, [arms sales can also prolong and
intensify ongoing conflicts and erode rather than promote regional
stability]{.underline}. Few governments, and fewer insurgencies, have
large enough weapons stocks to fight for long without resupply.82 The
tendency of external powers to arm the side they support, however
understandable strategically, has the inevitable result of allowing the
conflict to continue at a higher level of intensity than would otherwise
be the case. As one study of arms sales to Africa notes, "Weapons
imports are essential additives in this recipe for armed conflict and
carnage."83 Third, this dynamic appears to be particularly troublesome
with respect to internal conflicts. Jennifer Erickson, for example,
found that [recipients of major conventional weapons are 70 percent more
likely to engage in internal conflicts than other states.]{.underline}
Though halting arms sales alone is not a panacea for peace and
stability, arms embargoes can help lessen the destructiveness of combat
in both civil and interstate wars simply by restricting access to the
means of violence.84 Finally, because of their effects on both
interstate and internal conflict, [arms sales can also erode rather than
promote regional stability]{.underline}. As noted in the previous
section, where the United States seeks to manage regional balances of
power, [arms sales often create tension, whether because the American
role in the region threatens others or because American clients feel
emboldened]{.underline}. The Middle East, for example, has seesawed
between violence and tense standoffs for the past many decades, at first
because of Cold War competition and more recently because of the
American war on terror. The notion that increased U.S. arms sales since
9/11 made the Middle East more stable is far-fetched to say the least.
Similarly, though many argue that American security commitments to
countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have produced greater
stability, there is a strong case to be made that the opposite is now
true. American support of South Korea has driven North Korea to develop
nuclear weapons; the presence of U.S. missile defense systems in South
Korea has aggravated China, and American support of Taiwan produces
continual tension between the two powers.85 [Dispersion]{.underline}.
The United States uses a number of procedures to try to ensure that the
weapons it sells actually go to authorized customers and to monitor the
end use of the weapons so that they do not wind up being used for
nefarious purposes. The Department of State even compiles a list of
banned countries, brokers, and customers. But most of these tools have
proved ineffectual.86 Programs like Blue Lantern and Golden Sentry aim
to shed light on the service life of American weapons sold abroad
through end-use monitoring.87 While the description of U.S. end-use
monitoring ("pre-license, post-license/pre-shipment, and post-shipment")
sounds comprehensive, it's actually anything but. In fiscal year 2016,
the agency in charge of approving and monitoring arms sales, the
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), authorized 38,398
export-license applications --- down more than 50 percent from 2012
after the government shifted some weapons to the Department of
Commerce's purview.88 To oversee more than 35,000 export licenses
annually, the DDTC has a full-time staff of only 171 people. The Blue
Lantern program is executed by embassy staff in recipient countries but
administered back in Washington by only nine State Department employees
and three contractors.89 [Twelve people can't possibly track everything
that happens to billions of dollars' worth of advanced weaponry
transferred to dozens of countries abroad each year. Nor is the process
designed to correct problems]{.underline}. On one hand, end-use
violations can result in individuals and companies being prevented from
making future purchases. On the other hand, there is no evidence that
end-use monitoring has changed the pattern of American arms sales in any
way. The United States in truth has little or no control over what
happens to the weapons it sells to other nations. The result is that
year after year weapons of all kinds end up falling into the hands of
unreliable, risky, or just plain bad actors, at which point they're used
in ways neither the United States nor its customers intended. American
weapons have frequently wound up being used against Americans in combat.
And even more often, local and regional actors, including criminal
gangs, have employed them in their own conflicts. In civil wars, regime
collapse, or other extreme cases, factions steal weapons and use them
for their own purposes, as ISIS did in Iraq.90 Iraq, as previously
noted, provides an excellent case study in the inability of the United
States to prevent dispersion. As part of U.S. efforts to rebuild Iraq's
military and security capabilities after the 2003 invasion, the United
States sent Iraq roughly \$2.5 billion worth of American weapons through
2014, including everything from small arms to "armored personnel
carriers, military helicopters, transport aircraft, anti-tank missiles,
tanks, artillery and drones." 91 Despite the presence of thousands of
U.S. troops in-country and the very close relationship between those
troops and their Iraqi counterparts, many of those weapons went missing.
Between 2003 and 2008 alone, 360,000 out of 1 million small arms
disappeared, along with 2,300 Humvees. A sizable chunk of this weaponry
would later end up in the hands of ISIS. The Iraqi army, trained and
equipped by the American military, dissolved when faced by ISIS and left
their weapons behind for the terrorist group to pick up and use for
conquering and holding territory. A UN Security Council report found
that in June 2014 alone "ISIS seized sufficient Iraqi government stocks
from the provinces of Anbar and Salah al-Din to arm and equip more than
three Iraqi conventional army divisions."92 Data collected by Conflict
Armament Research in July and August of 2014 showed that 20 percent of
ISIS's ammunition was manufactured in the United States --- likely
seized from Iraqi military stocks.93 In short, dispersion enabled the
spread of ISIS and dramatically raised the costs and dangers of
confronting the group on the battlefield. Regime Effects. Finally, [arms
sales can also have deleterious effects on recipient
nations]{.underline} [--- promoting government oppression, instability,
and military coups]{.underline}. As part of the war on drugs, America
inadvertently enabled the practice of forced disappearances. In the
cases of Colombia, the Philippines, and Mexico, American weapons feed a
dangerous cycle of corruption and oppression involving the police, the
military, and political leaders.94 Though the United States provides
weapons to Mexico ostensibly for counternarcotics operations, the arms
transferred to the country often end up being used by police to oppress
citizens, reinforcing the "climate of generalized violence in the
country \[that\] carries with it grave consequences for the rule of
law."95 Similarly, in Colombia and the Philippines the United States has
supplied arms in an effort to support governments against external
threats or internal factions and to combat drug trafficking, but with
mixed results. A study of military aid to Colombia found that "in
environments such as Colombia, international military assistance can
strengthen armed nonstate actors, who rival the government over the use
of violence."96 Recent research reveals that American assistance
programs, like foreign military officer training, can increase the
likelihood of military coups. U.S. training programs frequently bought
by other nations, most notably International Military Education and
Training (IMET), gave formal training to the leaders of the 2009
Honduran coup, the 2012 Mali coup, and the 2013 Egyptian coup.97 In
these cases, the training that was supposed to stabilize the country
provided military leaders with the tools to overthrow the government
they were meant to support.
