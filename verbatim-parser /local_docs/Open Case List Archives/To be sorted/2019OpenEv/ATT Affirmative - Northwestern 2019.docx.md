President Donald [Trump's announcement]{.underline} in late April [that
[the U.S. will withdraw its signature from the Arms Trade Treaty]{.mark}
is the latest move]{.underline} by an administration innately **[hostile
to nearly every form of international cooperation.]{.underline}** In a
move that was intentionally deceptive and rife with political theater
--- with the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association as a
symbolic backdrop --- **[[the president's decision damages both
America's security and its credibility.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[It took more than five years of negotiations to develop the ATT and
we spent those years working together as the U.N.
consultant]{.underline}** to the treaty process **[and as the U.S. lead
negotiator]{.underline}**, working hard to develop a treaty text that
met U.S. interests and satisfied those dedicated to stopping the
irresponsible and illicit arms trade.

And we succeeded. [**The fi**nal text]{.underline}, which reflected
great compromise by close allies, **[is wholly consistent with American
priorities and values. [The]{.mark} president's [decision is an
abdication of U.S. leadership and moral
authority.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Most Americans do not know what the ATT is or does. The president even
seemed surprised that his announcement was met with cheers by the NRA
faithful, but the NRA has dominated the dialogue on the ATT in the
United States and the president willfully and gleefully gave credibility
to the NRA's politically expedient mythology on the arms trade.

[[**The ATT** makes the international arms trade safer]{.mark} and more
responsible]{.underline}. It requires governments, before granting an
export license for weapons, [to consider whether weapons could be used
for genocide or human rights violations]{.underline}, as well as the
likelihood that the weapons would be diverted into the wrong hands and
fuel civil conflict or criminal activity. [[It provides mechanisms for
governments to cooperate and a means for greater
transparency]{.underline}]{.mark} over a murky trade that contributes to
devastating human suffering --- including casualties to American service
members and civilians --- [in conflicts in places like Syria, Yemen and
Libya.]{.underline}

This [treaty reflects U.S. values and priorities.]{.underline}
Throughout the negotiations, we, as the U.N. consultant and the U.S.
government team, met regularly with interested defense industry and
nongovernmental organizations, briefing simultaneously defense
exporters, human rights advocates and Second Amendment advocates of how
the ATT furthered U.S. interests.

Industry, in particular, **[expressed the hope that requiring other
nations to meet American-style standards would help level the playing
field in the global arms market and close loopholes in other countries
that allow unscrupulous dealers to undermine legal U.S.
transactions.]{.underline}** That **[hope is now
extinguished]{.underline}**, as **[the administration has chosen to
stand with reckless regimes, such as North Korea, Iran and Syria, and
with Russia and China --- and against our biggest allies]{.underline}**
--- in allowing an arms trade that flows with impunity.

The [Obama administration viewed the ATT]{.underline} not
[as]{.underline} an arms control treaty, but as [a trade regulation
treaty]{.underline}, one that had the potential to ameliorate the worst
problems created by a wide-open global arms bazaar. [It has now fallen
victim to]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration's inherent
distrust of all international treaties. [**The p**resident's
action]{.underline} to remove a nonexistent "threat" to law-abiding
American citizens **[will not benefit America's defense industry or
American interests.]{.underline}**

Let's be clear: The ATT is not perfect. Even if it was fully
implemented, it would not solve all of the challenges created by the
global arms trade. But more than 100 other governments have committed to
the treaty, and momentum for implementation is strong. **[The treaty
will survive. [The U.S. reputation for concern about human suffering and
the country's credibility across all international affairs]{.mark} [will
suffer the greater harm]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### That undermines the ability for the US to have influence in the drafting of international treaties

Isolation: The Cost of Non-Ratification," 5/6/14,
<https://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/382719468.pdf>

However, [the costs of non-ratification are still significant going
forward. [If the world begins to see the U.S.]{.mark} as completely
[hamstrung by domestic political forces, the **leadership**]{.mark} the
international community expects **[from America could slowly
deteriorate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If the U.S. is unwilling to put its
official stamp of approval on a treaty aimed at positively contributing
to collective global security and human rights, then [[it runs the risk
of inviting the **international community to move forward on
other**]{.mark} **sensitive [issues without that leadership]{.mark} in
the future**. [The U.S. being sidestepped in future negotiations would
be a sizeable blow to its global leadership and **could result in the
adoption of treaties with norms contrary to U.S.
interests.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Arguments against ratification consistently include the point that the
United States has already done what is necessary to protect its vital
interests in the ATT, such as mandatory implementation of national
export and import control systems and transparent government records on
arms transfers. However, this contention is problematic. As soon as the
fiftieth nation ratifies the treaty, the ATT will enter into force, and
the Conference of States Parties must convene within a year afterward.
11 Critical outcomes regarding the enforcement mechanism, possible
amendments, and financial decisions will be decided at this point and as
of now, only those who have ratified stand to be included in this
process. The U.S. is currently lobbying for inclusion in the Conference
of States Parties even if it does not ratify, but no decision has been
made given the precedent that would set. Understandably there is
hesitation by those who have already ratified to allow the U.S. this
opportunity, as it would remove any existing incentive for ratification.
Any reservations amongst our allies regarding the possible skirting of
institutional norms and multilateral relations by the United States
could only be further enhanced by this move.

As previously stated, global leadership can be difficult to quantify.
But one potential method would be to look at the type of role a given
State plays in finding a solution to a perceived problem in relation to
its contribution to what is trying to be solved. [Although the United
States does not intentionally contribute to the illicit arms trade and
already follows all of the guidelines of the ATT, the U.S.' role as the
world's largest arms dealer requires a commensurate effort in terms of
leadership and promotion of global norms to achieve collective security
on this issue. While failure to ratify has not derailed the treaty, it
is impossible to ignore [the absence of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and it inevitably **[makes the treaty]{.mark} itself
[less robust and lessens pressure on other nations to
join.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Heather Hurlburt, former Executive Director of the National Security
Network, emphasizes this point by noting that **i**nternational
**r**elations can be seen as a "giant set of trades," and that [given
the importance of the ATT to other countries, the U.S.' failure to
ratify could return to haunt us]{.mark}]{.underline} [9 [when another
issue more important to U.S. interests is raised at the
UN]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Furthermore, Hurlburt notes [the
dependence]{.mark} of U.S. interests [on international norms]{.mark} and
the observation of those norms, and [likens ATT to a bargaining chip the
U.S. would be forfeiting for having negotiated but not ultimately
ratifying the treaty]{.mark}.]{.underline} 12 [[Given the global
direction toward]{.mark} more regional and [international institutions
that focus on]{.mark} a [multilateral]{.mark} approach to
[governance]{.mark} and regulation, [failure]{.mark} of the world's lone
superpower [to ratify]{.mark} such a treaty [damages its]{.mark}
credibility, political authority, and [prospects for future
leadership.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Of course, [[the act of withdrawal is of enormous symbolic importance
and will have **repercussions on** ]{.mark}**the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates\' [international relationships]{.mark}** and standing on
the world stage.]{.underline} The foundational principle of
international treaty law is pactasunt servanda;that is to say,
[agreements must be kept]{.underline}.77 Of course, circumstances change
and international obligations must sometimes be adjusted to change with
them. But [[if **our foreign partners feel that they can no longer rely
upon the U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, one of the chief
architects of the current global order, **to keep its international
commitments[, the foundations of]{.mark} that [order are
threatened]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [This is particularly true if the
change in U.S. position is perceived to be born not from a genuine
response to changed conditions, but from arbitrary and capricious
impulse]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

[[There are]{.mark} indubitably [States that would relish a return to a
global order that is a]{.mark}]{.underline} Hobbesian
[[free-for-all]{.underline}, [where]{.underline}]{.mark} [power is the
only arbiter and [the strong States dominate the
weak]{.mark}.]{.underline} It took the world centuries to inch away from
that model and towards a system of [[international cooperation]{.mark},
which **[is the only way to build sustainable solutions to]{.mark} truly
international problems such as [climate change, migration, and
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For the United States, [an important part of
the maintenance of the global rule of law is adherence to constitutional
requirements designed to protect against the risk of \"an ambitious or
unreasoned President disengaging the United States from crucial
bilateral and multilateral treaties with the stroke of a
pen.\"]{.underline}

#### Absent US involvement in international institutions, adversaries gain power through cooperation in alternative international institutions

First, and as mentioned previously, [[one]{.mark} of the [major
explanations for the longevity of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates' [primacy]{.mark} in the post-World War II era [has been
its]{.mark} establishment of, and [support for]{.mark}, the
international institutions and [treaties around which the existing
international system is based]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the dynamics
of unipolarity, and corresponding power disparities, make it unlikely
that systemic change will occur via traditional balancing dynamics, [the
[formation of alternative institutions represents a mechanism by which
other states can constrain US power]{.mark}]{.underline}. By outlining
the causal pathways by which this process occurs, this project
contributes to the literature on the stability and longevity of
hegemonic orders. [It also contributes to advancing long standing
debates on the role (or lack thereof) that hegemonic states play in the
process of institutional and regime formation]{.underline} (Keohane
1992; Young 1991).

#### US leadership in multilateral institutions is key to sustain the liberal international order \-\-- solves war

diplomat in residence at the University of Minnesota, Ph.D. in history

Erosion of the US Commitment to Multilateralism," 9/6/2018,
https://www.stanleyfoundation.org/articles.cfm?id=874&title=The-Good-of-Global-Governance

[The danger for the United States and]{.underline} for the cause of
[peace and security through multilateral action is real]{.underline}.
The administration's supporters argue that the United States needs to
act in its own interest and make decisions that are good for the United
States. But [the lessons of the past tell us that [unilateral actions
aren't in our own interest]{.mark}. The worst-case scenario is that
**[US undermining of multilateral institutions starts a spiraling out of
control that leads to war or conflagration]{.mark}**, or just a meaner
and less secure world. But it is also possible that **[others]{.mark} in
the world [will]{.mark} simply [move on without us, and]{.mark} other
countries---like China---will step up to [take leadership of]{.mark} the
political, economic, and security [structures]{.mark} [that set the
rules for how countries operate]{.mark} in the world, [imposing their
norms and advancing their interests]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Until now,
the United States has held that leadership, and [absent US engagement,
rules will]{.mark} continue to [be made that will impact us but that we
will not help shape]{.mark}. Many Americans have stepped up to say they
want to remain engaged]{.underline}, through local climate initiatives
and action on nuclear disarmament, refugees, and trade, [giving hope
that the United States won't leave leadership of the world scene to
others.]{.underline} But building a new leadership will take effort and
energy from us all.

## Contention 2 \-\-- Arms Market

#### Trump's withdrawal from the ATT exacerbates the illicit trade of arms

Paul D. **[Shinkman 19]{.underline}**, senior national security reporter
for U.S. News & World Report, "Trump to Withdraw U.S. From Key
International Weapons Pact," 4/26/19,
https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-04-26/trump-to-withdraw-us-from-key-international-weapons-pact

Advocates of the treaty say [[Trump\'s decision does **irreversible
damage** to governing the]{.mark} sale and [spread of weapons]{.mark}
internationally.]{.underline}

\"[[This sends a message that the U.S. is not committed to the]{.mark}
global [norm of]{.mark} restraint and [responsibility]{.mark} in the
global arms trade. I think **[that\'s a powerful
message,]{.mark}**\"]{.underline} says Rachel Stohl, managing director
of the Stimson Center\'s Conventional Defense Program who served as a
consultant to the U.N. in drafting the treaty.

[The agreement centers on standardizing the way countries document the
cross-border gun trade between governments, including requiring that its
members produce annual reports on imports and exports to provide a
better international understanding of what weapons are going
where]{.underline}. It requires participating countries to assess the
potential for violations to human rights or international humanitarian
law before authorizing an arms sale.

[[The system **helps identify destabilizing**]{.mark}, dangerous or
otherwise troublesome [**transfers** and allows other countries to
question]{.mark} those sales [and learn from one another how to control
them, supporters say.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"[There has never been a treaty that addresses the global trade in
conventional arms, and [this is every kind of system from small arms and
light weapons all the way up to fighter jets, warships and
tanks]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Stohl says. \"[[It provides a
great]{.mark}er **[opportunity for developing]{.mark} global
[norms]{.mark}** []{.mark}and for establishing criteria [that aim to
prevent deadly weapons from getting in the hands of unscrupulous
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\"]{.mark}

One hundred and thirty countries have signed the treaty, with 101
formally joining it and 96 ratifying it. Four annual meetings have taken
place since 2015.

Russia and China are not signatories of the treaty, though China is an
observer to the treaty\'s annual meetings.

International interest in the treaty began during the final months of
the presidency of George W. Bush, but the drafting and ratification
process took place during the Obama administration.

America\'s involvement in the treaty is unusual in that it was
principally influential in drafting the language to accommodate U.S.
laws and policies but is not an official party to it -- the U.S. signed
the treaty in 2013 prior to it coming into force in December 2014 but
had not ratified it, which would require congressional approval.

It\'s unclear precisely what steps the U.S. must take to withdraw itself
from the treaty.

Though the treaty itself does not govern the transfer of firearms
domestically or its use among member countries\' citizens, the NRA has
long criticized it, particularly that it does not contain a mechanism
for enforcement, and called for the U.S. to withdraw.

\"Every American should be concerned with not only their delegation\'s
open support of the ATT, but their promise that they are working towards
ratifying it at the first available opportunity,\" the NRA\'s lobbying
arm, the Institute for Legal Action, wrote in 2016, calling the
agreement \"a treaty aimed at attacking the Second Amendment.\"

However, the treaty\'s advocates say [[it serves as the **only tool** to
standardize and provide transparency for how countries buy and sell
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"[This announcement is a misguided blow to efforts to promote
international peace and security]{.underline},\" Adotei Akwei, deputy
director for advocacy and government relations at Amnesty International,
said in an emailed statement. \"[With this announcement [the Trump
admin]{.mark}istration [will re-open the floodgates for arms
sales]{.mark} with weakened human rights criteria, [which could]{.mark}
potentially [fuel brutal conflicts, and make everyone less
safe]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

Stohl says Trump\'s decision \"undermines that spirit of cooperation and
accountability that we should have as we -- not just the U.S., but as
countries -- make decisions to transfer lethal arms around the world.\"

The treaty\'s drafters went out of their way to craft language that
applies solely to the United States to avoid the perception that it
would limit domestic uses, like sport shooting or hunting, Stohl says.
It does not require domestic documentation about activities related to
firearms or call for a gun registry of individuals.

[**[Some of America\'s closest allies are reportedly planning to object
to Trump\'s decision]{.mark}**, and his announcement comes ahead of a
meeting with one of the world\'s most vocal advocates for the
treaty]{.underline}. Trump is scheduled to meet later Friday with
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose government has been lobbying
for more countries to join it.

Japan was the first in Asia and the most recent to preside over the
annual forum for signatories, known as the Conference of State Parties
to Arms Trade Treaty. In remarks last August, Japan\'s minister of
foreign affairs called the treaty \"undoubtedly a landmark
achievement.\"

It\'s unclear whether Abe will raise concerns about the treaty
withdrawal with Trump.

#### The ATT plays a crucial role in US leadership and saves millions of lives every year

Thalif **[Deen 19]{.underline}**, Director, Senior Editor, UN Bureau,
Inter Press Service (IPS) news agency, has been covering the United
Nations since the late 1970s, "US Takes Back Signature on Arms Trade
Treaty," 5/6/19,
https://www.transcend.org/tms/2019/05/us-takes-back-signature-on-arms-trade-treaty/

[[It's in the US interest to be part of the ATT]{.mark} and]{.underline}
to [work with other countries to increase their standards
for]{.underline} importing and [exporting weapons]{.underline}, she
noted.

'**[[Unsigning']{.mark} the ATT decreases our leverage with these
countries.]{.underline}** 'Do as I say, not as I do' is a cynical and
unpersuasive policy approach," said Dr Goldring who also represents the
Acronym Institute at the United Nations on conventional weapons and arms
trade issues.

Abby Maxman, President of Oxfam America, said [Trump's decision to
un-sign the Arms Trade Treaty "[is a reckless]{.mark}, self-inflicted
[wound that continues to]{.mark} [demonstrate the
Admin]{.mark}istration['s desire to turn its back on]{.mark} global
norms, standards and [US leadership. It is one]{.mark} more **[misguided
step to dismantle the international partnerships that keep us all
safe."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Just last week, the Administration held hostage a UN Security Council
resolution to address sexual violence in conflict-- until language about
the need for sexual & reproductive health services was removed.

And, it's no coincidence that this comes on the heels of President
Trump's veto of the Yemen War Powers Resolution and continued military
support for Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen, said Maxman.

[**President Trump is sending a clear message** to civilians caught in
the crossfire: "we don't care."]{.underline}

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will
now lock arms with Iran, No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and Syria as
non-signatories to this]{.mark} historic [treaty whose]{.mark} sole
[purpose is to protect innocent people from deadly
weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["[The **A**]{.underline}]{.mark}rms **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty [was developed and signed by the US
and others to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of those who may use
them to commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. **The
treaty [has the power to save millions]{.mark}** from death, rape,
assault and displacement. [Each year an estimated **500,000 people are
killed as a result of the unregulated and under-regulated arms
trade**]{.mark},]{.underline}" said Maxman.

#### US ratification of the ATT is key to model \-\-- allows the US to call out irresponsible nations on their failure to regulate arm sales

A. Trevor **[Thrall 5/6]{.underline}**, associate professor in the Schar
School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and a senior
fellow at the Cato Institute, "Trump's Misguided Assault on the ARMS
Trade Treaty", 5/6/19,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/trumps-misguided-assault-arms-trade-treaty>

In fact, not only doesn't **[[the A]{.mark}rms [T]{.mark}rade
[T]{.mark}reaty]{.underline}** threaten gun rights in America, it
**[[strengthens global efforts to reduce]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
damage done by **[[the illicit flow of]{.mark} conventional
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Instead of rejecting the treaty, the
United States should be promoting it.]{.underline}**

In force internationally since 2014 but not yet ratified by the United
States, **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** Arms Trade Treaty
**[([ATT]{.mark})]{.underline}** attempts to **[[regulate trade of
conventional weapons]{.mark} (everything from small arms to battle tanks
and warships) by [raising the standards for arms exports]{.mark} to
[ensure weapons are]{.mark} sold only to responsible state parties. The
goal is to encourage states to assess the risks before making any sales
and to keep weapons [off the black market, out of the hands of criminals
and terrorists, and]{.mark} to [make sure that]{.mark} transferred
[weapons don't]{.mark} wind up [contribut]{.mark}ing [to genocide, war
crimes, or other]{.mark} serious [violations of humanitarian
law]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The most misleading argument from the treaty's critics regards the
Second Amendment. Critics like the NRA have falsely argued that the
treaty will require governments to collect information on individuals
who purchase weapons from abroad and to report that information to the
exporting country on demand. Beyond that, critics also worry that even
if the treaty doesn't do so now, proponents of stricter regulations
could eventually amend the treaty so that it does, thereby restricting
American sovereignty. This concern, too, is unfounded.

On the contrary, the treaty does not require states to track purchases
by individual citizens, which make up a tiny fraction of the
international arms market. Further, the treaty explicitly states that
all signatories reserve the sovereign right to regulate arms according
to its own constitutional system and that each country will maintain
records "pursuant to national laws." Moreover, **[the United States
would have far more influence over the evolution of the ATT as a
signatory than it would as an outsider]{.underline}**. And of course,
the United States could always withdraw from the ATT if the treaty
someday did in fact take a turn for the worse.

The real goal of end use monitoring under **[the ATT]{.underline}** ---
already a longstanding component of U.S. arms export policy - is to
**[ensure that exported weapons end up and remain in the possession of
the intended recipients and that the companies and governments that
purchase the weapons are in fact responsible customers]{.underline}**.
Far from requiring the United States to change its policies, the treaty
in fact did not require any change to U.S. policies. In many respects
the ATT is simply an effort to encourage other nations to upgrade their
arms exports policies to match existing U.S. standards. The treaty poses
no threat to the right to bear arms.

Another overblown argument Trump likes to make is about the economic
benefits of arms sales. Trump once claimed that the 2017 deal with Saudi
Arabia could mean as many as a million American jobs, and the
administration's updated Conventional Arms Transfer policy puts a heavy
emphasis on increasing arms exports. The problem, as a recent report
from the Security Assistance Monitor discusses, is that **[[arms
sales]{.mark} do not create nearly as many jobs as Trump claims, for at
least two reasons. First, more than 25 percent of U.S. arms deals permit
manufacturing of weapons in countries outside of the United States.
Second, American defense contractors offer offsets --- essentially huge
discounts --- to purchasing nations which dramatically [lowers both the
profits and the number of American jobs]{.mark}
generated.]{.underline}**

Finally, several major arms exporters **[like [Russia, China]{.mark},
and India are not currently [signatories to the ATT, leading some to
argue]{.mark} that [the ATT]{.mark} only [constrains]{.mark} responsible
countries like the United States, while leaving irresponsible states
free to continue selling weapons to whomever they choose. Though
superficially persuasive, [this argument has things
backwards.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[International agreements are more
influential and]{.mark} more]{.underline}** likely to be **[[successful
when the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [supports them.]{.mark}
If [the U]{.mark}nited [States]{.mark} wants other nations to abide by
the treaty, it [needs to take the lead by ratifying]{.mark} and living
up to [the treaty]{.mark}'s principles regardless of what other nations
do. [This]{.mark} approach [maximizes American moral leadership and soft
power]{.mark} --- allowing the United States [to call out irresponsible
nations without fear of hypocrisy and amplifying its
persuasiveness]{.mark} about the importance of regulating the
international arms trade]{.underline}**.

None of this is to argue that the ATT is a perfect treaty, or that
American support is sufficient to ensure its success, but the arguments
made by critics of the ATT just don't hold water. Far from being a
threat to the United States, the ATT is a potentially useful tool of
American foreign policy. **[Millions of weapons circulate the globe
today on the black market, and illegally obtained weapons are
responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of people every year. The
ATT]{.underline}** won't eradicate illicit arms trafficking, but it
**[represents a step in the right direction]{.underline}**.

#### That results into an international follow on

Joel [**Jaeger 14**, Research assistant at the World Resources
Institute, "The US Should Ratify the UN Arms Trade Treaty"
4/9/14,]{.underline} <https://oleville.com/politicole/2014/04/09/1678/>

***[\*\* edited for ableist language \*\*]{.underline}***

On April 2, 2013, the UN General Assembly adopted the Arms Trade Treaty
(ATT), a multilateral convention that for the first time places
legally-binding regulations on the \$85 billion-a-year conventional arms
trade. According to the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs,
118 states have signed the ATT, and 31 have ratified it, but 50
ratifications are required before the treaty enters into force. US
Secretary of State John Kerry signed the ATT on September 25, 2013, but
a number of US Senators, supported by the National Rifle Association
(NRA) have made clear that they plan to prevent the treaty from
achieving the two-thirds Senate majority necessary for US ratification.
[As the world's largest exporter of conventional arms**, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should ratify the
ATT]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The treaty is far from perfect, but
[[it]{.mark}s benefits to international peace and security outweigh its
risks. By ratifying the ATT, the United States [would facilitate]{.mark}
a widespread [improvement in]{.mark} national [arm]{.mark}s export
[controls]{.mark}, [put]{.mark} [pressure]{.mark} [on]{.mark} other
[states]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [accept]{.mark} the treaty, [and
secure]{.mark} a greater voice in the future of the
[international]{.mark} arms [trade]{.mark} regime, all without violating
the Second Amendment or having to substantially change its own arms
transfer controls.]{.underline}

[The final text of the ATT was a compromise between major arms
exporters, progressive states, and civil society organizations. It
limits arms transfers to abusers of international humanitarian and human
rights law, increases arms trade transparency, and promotes the sharing
of best practices for national export controls. The ATT's regulations
apply to small arms and light weapons, as well as a variety of combat
vehicles and heavy weapons.]{.underline} The treaty only partially
applies to ammunition, and does not mention more recent technological
advances such as unmanned aerial vehicles.

[[The]{.mark} heart of the **[ATT]{.mark} seeks to [ensure]{.mark} that
conventional [weapons do not fall into]{.mark} the [wrong
hands]{.mark}**. According to Article 6(3) of the ATT, states [parties
shall not authorize transfers]{.mark} of conventional weapons
[if]{.mark} they have [knowledge that]{.mark} the [arms would be used
in]{.mark} the commission of genocide[, crimes]{.mark} against humanity,
or war crimes]{.underline}. [Article 7 prohibits arms transfers if there
is an overriding risk of the **[weapons]{.mark} being used to
[undermine]{.mark} peace and [security]{.mark} [or]{.mark} commit a
serious violation of international [humanitarian]{.mark} or human rights
[law]{.mark}**. Article 11 asks state parties to take a number of
measures to prevent diversion of weapons. Although the ATT is legally
binding, like most UN treaties it is unenforceable and relies on
national implementation.]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} mere presence of the
[[ATT]{.underline}]{.mark} does not guarantee that states will stop
selling weapons to human rights violators, but it [may be able to [shift
a state's]{.mark} political [calculus over]{.mark} whether it chooses to
ignore or heed the international [community's
condemnations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The success of the ATT will rely
upon civil society organizations to monitor the progress of states
parties, calling out those governments that do not adhere to their
promises. While [the ATT]{.underline} will not instantly create new
international norms, it [will provide the basis for future developments
and improvements.]{.underline}

This emerging international [arms trade [regulation]{.mark} regime [will
be]{.mark} ~~crippled~~ [\*hindered\* if the US]{.mark} Congress [does
not ratify the ATT,]{.mark} and [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[will have missed]{.mark} an important [chance to further]{.mark} its
international [influence]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States already
has some of the most stringent export controls in the world, so very
little would have to be done to bring it into compliance with the
treaty. [Other [states]{.mark} that [have weak]{.mark}er export controls
would have a much [larger obligation, and would]{.mark} be
[force]{.mark}d to [raise their standards]{.mark} to the level of the
United States.]{.underline} [The substantial [gains]{.mark} in
international security would far [outweigh]{.mark} the minimal
[changes]{.mark} that the United States would have to make.]{.underline}

[If the United States were [to]{.mark} [ratify]{.mark} the ATT, it
[would]{.mark} [pressure]{.mark} other states to do the
same.]{.underline} [According to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, the top six exporters of conventional arms are the
United States, [Russia]{.mark}, Germany, France, [China]{.mark}, and the
United Kingdom. Together, their arms sales make up 78 percent of the
global market. Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have already
signed and will probably ratify the ATT, but Russia and China have not
even signed the treaty. In general,]{.underline} [the more states
parties to the ATT, the more pressure there will be on others to join,
but the unique position of the United States makes its [approval]{.mark}
of the **treaty a litmus [test]{.mark} of its [future]{.mark}
[success]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

**[[Wars are on the rebound]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[There
are [twice](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/icrc-more-conflicts-more-sides-conflict-equal-greater-danger-study) as
many civil conflicts today]{.underline}**, for example, **[as there were
in 2001. ]{.underline}**And **[[the number of nonstate armed
groups participating in the bloodshed is
multiplying]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), roughly **[half of today's
wars involve between three and nine opposing groups]{.underline}**. Just
**[over 20 percent involve more than 10 competing
blocs. In]{.underline}** a handful, including **[ongoing conflicts
in Libya and Syria, hundreds of armed groups vie for
control.]{.underline}** For the most part, **[these warring factions are
themselves [highly
fragmented](https://www.icrc.org/en/publication/roots-restraint-war),
and today's warriors are just as likely to be affiliated with
drug cartels, mafia groups, criminal gangs, militias, and terrorist
organizations as with armies or organized rebel factions.]{.underline}**

**[This cocktail of [criminality]{.mark},
extremism, and insurrection [is sowing havoc in]{.mark} parts of
[Central and South America, sub-Saharan and North Africa, the Middle
East, and Central Asia]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Not
surprisingly, **[these conflicts are defying conventional international
responses]{.underline}**, such as formal cease-fire negotiations, peace
agreements, and peacekeeping operations. And diplomats, military
planners, and relief workers are unsure how best to respond. The
problem, it seems, is that while the insecurity generated by these [new
wars](https://www.amazon.com/New-Old-Wars-Organized-Violence/dp/080478549X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531956323&sr=1-1&keywords=new+wars+kaldor&dpID=51emuSrMDRL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch%20\t%20_blank) is
real, **[there is still no common lexicon or legal framework for dealing
with them.]{.underline}**

Situated at the intersection of organized crime and outright war, they
raise tricky legal, operational, and ethical questions about how to
intervene, who should be involved, and the requisite safeguards to
protect civilians.

**[[Mexico is on the front lines of]{.mark} today's metastasizing [crime

2006, **[[violent competition among]{.mark} the Mexican

200,000 dead.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**There were more than 29,000 murders
in 2017, but 2018 is set to [see even
more](http://time.com/5324888/mexico-violence-murders/)---perhaps the
most ever. In Guerrero alone, more
than [2,500 people](https://suracapulco.mx/2018/01/22/hubo-en-2017-en-guerrero-2-mil-529-homicidios-dolosos-es-el-mas-violento-del-pais/) were

militias) and 18 criminal outfits. Owing to endemic violence and the
government's slow retreat from crime-ridden areas, some **[towns are now
run by parallel governments made up of criminalized political and
administrative structures. In ]{.underline}**what are increasingly
labeled "**[[narco-cities](http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/narco-cities-mexico-and-beyond),"
the entire political and economic apparatus exists to perpetuate a drug
economy.]{.underline}**

**[In Brazil]{.underline}**, meanwhile **[large portions of some of the
country's biggest cities are under the control of competing drug

Some 1,000 low-income communities, roughly 20 percent of Rio de Janeiro,

the Primeiro Comando da Capital (First Capital Command, or PCC). And

Making matters worse, **[[Latin American armed groups are

Today's crime wars hark back to a pre-Westphalian era of perpetual
conflict involving feudal kingdoms and marauding bandits.

This partly explains why the norms developed to regulate armed conflict
between modern states don't really apply.

In the classical view, **[criminal groups]{.underline}** (such as
mafias, gangs, and cartels) **[are not political actors formally capable
of waging war.]{.underline}** This means they can't be treated as enemy
combatants, nor can they be tried for war crimes. Yet,
increasingly, such groups do advance tangible [political
objectives](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-monterrey-drugs-recruits1-2009mar13-story.html),
from the election of corrupted politicians to the creation of
autonomous religious states. What is more, they routinely govern,
control territory,
provide [aid](http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/mexican-cartel-strategic-note-no-24-cartel-and-gang-provision-post-earthquake-humanitarian) and
social goods, and tax and extort money from the populations under their
control. They also often collude with corrupt soldiers, police, prison
guards, and customs officials to expand their rule. Put
succinctly, **[[cartels and
gangs](http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgu_facbooks/13/) may not
necessarily aim to displace recognized governments, but the net
result of their activities is that they do.]{.underline}**

Further, **[whereas the human cost of typical gang or mafia activity may
be contained, the death and destruction that result from today's crime
wars are not.]{.underline}** Millions of refugees and internally
displaced persons [have
fled](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2018/0614/After-asylum-limits-some-ask-Does-gang-violence-need-a-new-name) these
gray-zone conflicts. But many of those who are dislocated are stuck in
limbo, with most of them having been refused asylum, which---as codified
in international refugee law, international humanitarian law, and by the
International Criminal Court---is typically granted to people
fleeing international and civil wars. Governments have typically been
reluctant to recognize the dislocated as war refugees, because it would
grant legitimacy to the crime wars. Yet with all the civilians killed
and maimed, [mayors and
journalists](http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/mexican-cartel-strategic-note-no-25-mexicos-presidential-election-challenged) attacked,
families forced to
flee [genocide](http://www.jornada.com.mx/2009/11/30/opinion/018a1pol) and [disappearances](http://desaparecidos.proceso.com.mx/),
**[[the violence generated by crime wars is indistinguishable from that
generated by traditional war.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Crime wars are not going away]{.underline}**, which is why the United
Nations, its member states, and the international humanitarian
community should clarify whether high-intensity crime is a purely
domestic problem to be dealt with by policing and criminal justice
(as argued
by [Carlos Iván Fuentes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1134123)of
the U.N. Office of Legal Affairs, as well as [Paul Rexton Kan and Phil
Williams](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592311003589732?journalCode=fswi20) of
the U.S. Army War College and the University of Pittsburgh's Center for
International Security Studies, respectively) or a [criminal
insurgency](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/FMSH-WP/halshs-00694083) (as [Christian Vianna de Azevedo](http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/criminal-insurgency-brazil),
from Brazil's Federal Police, and [other
scholars](https://www.cnas.org/press/press-release/cnas-releases-new-report-crime-wars-gangs-cartels-and-u-s-national-security) would
have it). And if there is consensus on the latter view, **[armed
interventions will have to adhere to the host of protections contained
in international humanitarian law.]{.underline}**

Whatever the answer, it is
certainly worth [debating](https://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2012/02/16/part-i-rethinking-the-intensity-and-organization-of-violence-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/) appropriate rules
of engagement. Given that **[some [cartels and gangs front
well-armed]{.mark} ]{.underline}**and disciplined
**[[soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [improvised infantry fighting
vehicles](http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/narco-armor-in-mexico), top-of-the-line [communications
and surveillance
networks](https://www.wired.com/2011/12/cartel-radio-mexico/), **[[and
military-grade weapons]{.mark} (such as [rocket-propelled
grenades](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexican-army-helicopter-was-shot-down-with-rocket-propelled-grenades-1430783784) and [antipersonnel
mines](http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/mexican-cartel-tactical-note-36-claymore-anti-personnel-mines-minas-antipersonales))]{.underline}**, as
well as use [high-intensity
tactics](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2011/RAND_MG1125.pdf)(including
ambushes and attacks on police and military forces), the threat cannot
be wished away.

And even if a definition of crime wars is sorted
out, observers still need to make distinctions among today's
belligerents. The key to determining what kinds of laws such groups are
subject to will be their official status---whether they are designated
as rebels, gangsters, or terrorists; how their organization is
structured; and the intensity of their violent interactions.
Generally, clear territorial control and a high intensity of fighting
could bump a group up to the point where it would have to comply with
international humanitarian law under [Article
1](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=93F022B3010AA404C12563CD0051E738) of
the Geneva Conventions' Additional Protocol II.

To take just a few cases, as the Geneva Academy noted in [The War Report
2017](https://www.geneva-academy.ch/joomlatools-files/docman-files/The%20War%20Report%202017.pdf),
armed gang violence in Colombia, El Salvador, and Mexico is of
particular concern. In all three cases, "armed gangs often use heavy
weaponry, and some control sizeable territory and have the ability to
conduct military operations, while the military is frequently involved
in their repression," a summary of the
report [states](http://www.rulac.org/news/the-war-report-armed-conflicts-in-2017). "The
number of civilian casualties linked to gang violence and state
responses to this violence, might also exceed those of major current
armed conflicts." The Colombian and Mexican cases, according to the
report, should constitute "non-international armed conflicts." This does
not necessarily mean that domestic or international military
intervention is required, since civil policing is still a viable
option in many situations, but it would bind states to the norms of
international jurisprudence. By contrast, the situation in El
Salvador does not rise to the level of war, since the MS-13 and Barrio
18 are less organized.

This new breed of crime conflicts involving cartels, gangs, and militia
is challenging established norms about what is, and what isn't, war.

**[[The need for binding
international]{.underline}]{.mark}** humanitarian and human
rights law, domestic obligations, and **[[constraints for these armed
groups is real]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even if it is controversial. Some
humanitarian agencies are already testing out new approaches to
mitigating the suffering generated by these conflicts. For more than a
decade, the ICRC has quietly administered pilot programs in [Rio de
Janeiro](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/rio-project-programs-helped-reduce-humanitarian-impact-violence-rio-de-janeiro), [Port-au-Prince](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20846354), [Medellín](https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/interview/2013/12-19-colombia-medellin-project.htm), [Mexico
City](https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/americas/mexico), [Karachi](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/health-care-danger-project-karachi), and
other settings it labels as "situations of violence." But a more
comprehensive approach is needed, one that is upgraded to today's
realities. **[If the world fails to see crime wars as wars, the
humanitarian and political cost of them will only rise.]{.underline}**

#### Organized crimes are the largest global threats\-\-- cause regional instability, failed states, and global conflict

**[Divya Srikanth 14]{.underline}**, Rajaratnam School of International
Studies, a leading research-intensive and teaching institution in
strategic and international affairs and policy-oriented think tank in
the Asia-Pacific region, April 2014, "NON-TRADITIONAL SECURITY THREATS
IN THE 21ST CENTURY: A REVIEW",
www.ijdc.org.in/uploads/1/7/5/7/17570463/2014junearticle4.pdf

Introduction [Unlike the preceding centuries]{.underline}, [in which the
gravest security threats that a nation-state faced were invariably the
armies of other states, in the 21st century, this is no longer the
case]{.underline}. **[The emergence of a number of [non-state
actors]{.mark}, such as [terrorist networks, drug cartels and maritime
piracy networks, and]{.mark}]{.underline}** intra-state conflicts (e.g.
[**[civil wars]{.underline}**) [have assumed importance as new-age
threats to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [national security of present-day
states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Apart from such non-state and transnational
actors, the impact of environmental degradation on the future of the
nation-state, especially the implications of global climate change, has
emerged as a credible and serious threat to the future existence of
modern-day nationstates. Demographical changes, such as an aging and/or
shrinking population, especially acute in the Western developed
countries, have emerged as the one social factor that might influence
global power politics in the future. Finally, technological advancements
in the 21st century, particularly with respect to the Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) revolution, have facilitated the
emergence of cyber-warfare and cyber-espionage, triggering the slow
shift of the battlefield from land, air and sea to cyberspace. 2. Rise
of Non-state Actors The world underwent seismic shifts in the 20th
century in the form of two resource-draining world wars, the creation of
a bipolar world order, numerous proxy wars, end of the Cold War and
emergence of the US as the sole superpower. The formation of the United
Nations in the aftermath of World War 2 and its ensuing proclamation
that the military forces of member-states could be deployed only for
self-defense, collective self-defense or collective security, as
identified and legitimized by passing a UN resolution, has resulted in
effective "outlawing" of the use of offensive military force by the UN
member-states. According to World Bank, the frequency of inter-state and
civil wars has now reduced, in comparison with those that were fought in
the 20th century. When the UN was established, it was primarily
structured to deal with states. However, [**modern conflict is no longer
restricted to only wars between the military forces of states**. The
rise of organized crime networks]{.underline} (e.g. drug cartels)
[[and]{.mark} terrorist groups in the 21st century has led to a scenario
where such non-state actors [pose **a greater threat**]{.mark} **to a
state's national security [than]{.mark} the [military forces]{.mark} of
other states.**]{.underline} 2.1 Transnational organized crime networks
are especially a potent threat to a state's national security because of
a number of reasons. The World Bank (2013) defines an organized crime
network as one that uses force and coercion for pursuit of wealth by
criminal means. Thus, going by this definition, [international drug
cartels, [arms smuggling groups and maritime piracy networks can be
classified as some of the major organized crime networks.]{.mark} Drug
cartels have especially gained importance in the last few decades
because of their greater access to resources]{.underline} (both
financial and organizational) [and use of sophisticated technological
advancements]{.underline} in order to improve their risk management
strategies and thus evade capture by the state security agencies.
**[[O]{.mark}rganized [crime]{.mark} networks usually [mushroom and
thrive in "weak" or "failed" states]{.mark} (mostly underdeveloped
[and]{.mark} developing countries),]{.underline}** which are
characterized by ineffective government control, poor law and order
control situation, weak regulatory framework for protecting business
activities and a corrupt judiciary. **[Because these networks are
non-state actors]{.underline}**, by default, **[they [do not conform
to]{.mark} the [i]{.mark}nternational [laws]{.mark} and treaties [that
govern]{.mark} a [state]{.mark} in its use of
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Non-state actors are neither limited
by territorial boundaries, nor]{.mark} do they recognize the concept of
[sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As a result, [international drug
cartels and [illegal arms sales networks flout all international rules
during their operations.]{.mark}]{.underline} They also use bribery as
an effective instrument to attract and/or coerce the very personnel who
are employed by the state to combat them. [Since state security agencies
and police forces in developing and impoverished countries are more
susceptible to the lure of bribes, such organized crime networks thrive
well in these regions]{.underline}. However, this is not to arrive at
the conclusion that organized crime operations flourish only in these
regions. The US and European Union serve as the two biggest markets for
drugs, and the drug cartels can reap in profits by exclusively focusing
on these markets alone. A number of states are "involved" during the
trajectory from production to reaching the final destination,
categorized by Williams (2014) as follows: "home" state (where the drug
originates), the transshipment states (which can be one or more states
that are involved in the transit of the drug shipments), the host or
market states and the service state (which usually act as safe havens
for illegal financial transactions). The same applies for other
organized crime networks such as arms smuggling or the transport of
illegal migrants. Thus the networks flout the sovereignty of not one,
but many states and also may bribe the authorities involved of multiple
states in the process, thereby extending their web of influence and
threatening the national security of multiple states at the same time.
[It has become increasingly difficult for the state authorities to nab
the leaders of such networks]{.underline}. One [reason is
[institutionalized corruption in the]{.mark} [state]{.mark}
system]{.underline} (e.g. in Colombia), [which [ensures]{.mark} the
["protection" of]{.mark} the [leaders]{.mark}.]{.underline} In some
cases, charismatic leaders of the organized crime networks even publicly
involve themselves in philanthropy and charity, portraying themselves as
more efficient and "welfare-oriented" than the local elected government.
This is usually effective in the "home" state, where the people usually
suffer from poverty, high crime rates and the lax attitude of government
authorities in addressing their grievances. [The organized crime
networks assume the identity of a generous benefactor and protector of
the people, thus cultivating a Stockholm Syndrome-like attitude in the
general public, who begin to view the state with mistrust and gravitate
toward these crime syndicates with their problems, thereby undermining
the local police and military force and contributing to the overall
degeneration of the national security of the state]{.underline}. Thus
[[the **state is made**]{.mark} **progressively [weaker]{.mark},
[unti]{.mark}l the [security]{.mark} situations [spirals into chaos
and]{.mark} the prospect of a [civil war]{.mark} may become
imminent**]{.underline}. The major obstacle to a combating an organized
crime network is that, invariably, the state is perceived to be in a
weaker position, which, in a way, "legitimizes" the former's influence.
The situation is exacerbated when there is inter- drug-cartel rivalry
for supremacy, along with the conflict between the drug cartels and the
state government, as is the case in Mexico Drug War. 2.2 **[Terrorism
and insurgency have emerged as the most widely recognizable and visible
threats to a nation's security]{.underline}**, especially after the 9/11
attacks. Hoffman (2013) defines terrorism as the "deliberate creation
and exploitation of fear through violence or threat of violence in
pursuit of political change". Although terrorist and insurgency groups
are similar to organized crime networks in their use (or threat of use)
of force to achieve their stated objectives, the most important and
fundamental difference is in their objectives: while drug cartels and
arms smuggling networks primarily operate to increase their wealth,
terrorist and insurgency networks always have a political goal.
Moreover, insurgency groups differ from terrorist groups in their quest
for self-determination and hold over territory, usually fighting the
established local government or foreign power, who they perceive to be
illegitimate occupying forces. Also, organized crime networks manipulate
state machinery to ensure that their businesses flourish, while
terrorist groups target the civilian population in order to seek
attention to their political demands[. The one commonality between
transnational organized crime networks and terrorist groups that is also
the major source of security threat to a state that harbors such groups
is that both are non-state actors, and like the former, **terrorist
groups do not recognize the concept of state boundaries, sovereignty or
international norms and regulations on the use of force.**]{.underline}
As a result, [civilians, diplomats and media persons are routinely
targeted by terrorist groups]{.underline}. The effective use of suicide
bombers to target civilians in crowded places, the employment of
sophisticated technology and tactics such as leaderless movements (i.e.
terrorist organizations that do not have a visible leader), sleeper
cells (especially in India) and phantom cell networks have made it
increasingly difficult for the governments to wipe off terrorist groups.
Also, while the members of a terrorist network, especially suicide
bombers, might be thought of as irrational or brain-washed, the leader
of the terrorism network is a completely "rational" person. As a result,
[governments find it increasingly difficult to track down and annihilate
terrorist groups and their leaders]{.underline}. **[[Terrorist
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as the Shining Path (Peru) also
**[[tap into]{.mark} the [or]{.mark}ganized [crime]{.mark} network in
order to set up a highly successful drugs smuggling network [to
fund]{.mark} their terrorist [campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This
leads, sometimes, to a blurring of lines between organized crime and
terrorism]{.underline}, placing additional pressure on the governments
in their combat against such intertwined networks. The most important
advantage of a terrorist group is their effective use of the element of
surprise, catching the public and the government off guard, especially
if they use a neutral territory to conduct a terrorist attack. Combating
terrorism has been hampered by the increased organizational efficiency
of terrorist groups (e.g. leaderless networks) and ineffective use of
brute force and targeted killings by the state (in Chechnya and
Palestine). It would be of note here that the last inter-state war
between Israel and an Arab state was nearly 30 years ago, the recent
wars that Israel waged were against non-state actors (i.e. Hezbollah and
Hamas). [[Doubts over]{.mark} whether terrorism can completely been
annihilated have plagued the minds of [counterterrorist
operatives,]{.mark} **which [also weakens]{.mark} the [state's
response]{.mark} to tackle this global threat to security and peace.**
Thus the threat of terrorism still remains a very important factor that
shapes a state's sense of national security.]{.underline} 3. Civil War
and Regime Change [Although the post-World War 2 period saw the
establishment and strengthening of the **U**nited
**N**ations]{.underline} and the formation of what Jervis (2002) defines
a "pluralistic security community" (a term initially coined by Karl
Deutsch), comprising a group of nations who fought the previous world
wars (i.e. US, the EU and Japan), among whom the breakout of inter-state
war is unimaginable, [this does not literally translate to a peaceful
international community]{.underline}. Apart from wars that are
occasionally fought between other states outside the security community,
intra-state wars (most importantly, civil wars) still threatens the
lives of thousands of civilians caught in conflict. Annan (1998) states
that **["\[m\]ost wars are now civil wars".]{.underline}** According to
Nye and Welch (2013), 89 of the 113 conflicts in the period between end
of cold war and beginning of the 21st century were purely civil wars.
**[Civil wars are more destructive that inter-state wars because of
their duration]{.underline}** (they usually last longer than inter-state
wars), **[the high number of civilian deaths, instances of the inability
of the government to emphatically defeat the rebel groups]{.underline}**
(if the civil war is between state and non-state actors) [and the
involvement of different ethnic groups in the conflict.]{.underline}
Since civil wars are usually fought between intra-state groups (usually
the government and one or more non-state actors), [they are classified
as internal affairs of states, hence **hindering UN intervention**
during the initial stages, which might prevent spiraling of the
conflict]{.underline}. The [Syrian]{.underline} civil war [is an example
of how the UN and the member-states failed to effectively stop the
strife, thereby resulting in the escalation of war to the extent where
chemical weapons were used against innocent civilians.]{.underline} One
of the disadvantages of the way the UN has been structured is that it
authorizes the use of force to respond only to situations where there is
a clear evidence of aggression. In civil wars, as Nye and Welch (2013)
argue, identification of the aggressor is not always easy. When UN
intervention is not found to be effective enough, sometimes foreign
intervention occurs, usually when the situation spirals out of control,
as it happened in Libya (Downes, 2011). However, civil wars are
inherently recursive in nature. About 40% of states that endured a civil
war and a resulting regime change imposed by a foreign power suffered a
relapse within a decade. Regime change is usually not effective because
of the sudden reversal of fortunes of a particular group involved in the
conflict, which the group might object to, usually through violence.
Thus [civil wars are difficult to end through UN or foreign
intervention; usually such conflicts end only when one group has a
resounding and complete victory over the others, which might take
decades]{.underline}. In the meantime, the law and order situation is
thrown into disarray, with rise in crimes and murders. **[This leads
to]{.underline}** a situation of "**[failed states]{.underline}**",
**[where a combination of intra-state war and foreign intervention has
resulted in the state government losing control and power over the
military establishment or the state in general]{.underline}**. There are
a number of examples of civil wars resulting in failed states, such as
Iraq, Afghanistan and Rwanda. **[[There is also the possibility of
"spillover", where a civil war in one country affects the stability and
peace of the neighboring countries as well due to inflow or outflow
of]{.mark} refugees, rebel fighters, [arms and ammunition into the
adjacent states]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus **[[civil wars invariably
lead to regional instability and a degenerating security
situation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### \[crime wars = extinction\]

#### Terrorists will use CBRNs\-\--interest is growing now\-\--causes extinction

**[Marko M. Krstic 17]{.underline}**, Ministry of Internal Affairs of
the Republic of Serbia, "TENDENCY OF USING CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL,
RADIOLOGICAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR TERRORIST PURPOSES",
scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0042-8469/2017/0042-84691702481K.pdf

The studies of a few cases of earlier CBRN actions have led experts to
identify the key characteristics of terrorist groups that could
potentially have an interest to use these weapons. It is thought that
conservatism is inherent in terrorist organizations, but it must not be
forgotten that [some terrorists are inclined to innovations in weapons
and tactics, as well as to taking risks in actions or in the choice of
weapons]{.underline}. Many experts agree that most terrorist
organizations want to use proven methods to achieve desired effects.
Innovations, especially in the field of CBRN weapons, often indicate
terrorists are likely to be led by other factors rather than by pure
curiosity and desire to experiment. For some individuals, repression and
democratic and strong rule of law are positive determinants of the
emergence of CBRN actions which points to a new and more complex global
security environment with an increasing risk of terrorists trying to
perform a CBRN attack. It is a frightening fact that [[a single
terrorist]{.mark} or isolated terrorist group [could improvise]{.mark} a
biological weapon or use other ways to spread [anthrax, smallpox or
other]{.mark} [bio]{.mark}logical [agents and]{.mark} thereby [cause
mass casualties and destroy]{.mark} the health care system of [a
state]{.mark}. **[CBRN weapons are secretly shipped to terrorists or
hostile governments and represent a significant and growing
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to many countries. [Although **[the threat
of]{.mark} CBRN [attacks is]{.mark} widely [recognized as the central
issue of national security]{.mark}**]{.underline}, most [analysts assume
that the primary danger is a threat of the military use of these weapons
in conventional wars]{.underline} with tra-ditional military means while
**[the [threat of covert attacks]{.mark}, which include terrorism, [is
rashly and unfairly neglected]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Covert attacks
are difficult to deter or prevent and **CBRN weapons suitable for this
type of attack are available to a growing number of enemy states and
groups.**]{.underline} At the same time, [restrictions on their use
appear to be diminishing, and so-called new terrorists do not always
escalate and become apparent only by using unconventional
weapons]{.underline}. These **[[weapons are easily]{.mark} spread or
[transmitted]{.mark} from person to person, [have a high mortality
rate]{.mark} and]{.underline}** a potential impact on public health,
**[causing mass casualties]{.underline}** that can crush health systems
and cause public panic and social disruption, thus requiring special
efforts to suppress them. When assessing the threat of CBRN weapons, we
should take into account [the change in capacity to carry out terrorist
attacks that are on the rise among countries and non-government
elements]{.underline}. Analysts believe that the fear of chemical and
biological terrorist attacks is excessive, they point out that, in the
past, very few attacks involved these weapons, and even those few
attempts that have occurred were mostly thwarted by the authorities.
**[A relative ease with which biological weapons can be obtained, along
with other current changes and turbulences in the world, sets the stage
for another type of warfare in the 21st century. The potential for CBRN
terrorism has widely grown]{.underline}** since 11 September, when some
of these materials were used. **[The danger of terrorist use of nuclear
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction represents a very serious
threat]{.underline}** for many countries; **[[if a terrorist group could
gain access]{.mark} to this weapon[, it is highly likely it would use
it]{.mark}, or threaten to use it.]{.underline}** Although there is very
little information on terrorists and their ability to come into
possession of nuclear weapons or on their intentions to get them, [the
risk of CBRN weapons has certainly increased since the terrorists
started to become more familiar with these agents and their harmful
consequences.]{.underline} Discovering the nature of the threat of
biological weapons, as well as the appropriate response to them requires
an emphasis on the biological characteristics of these instruments of
war and terror. Preparing for a terrorist attack may seem daunting and
there are a small number of people with practical experience and a good
knowledge of CBRN weapons, because until recently there was no need to
own them. In the past, most of the planning regarding emergency response
to terrorism concentrated on the concerns of open attacks (bombing).
However, the threats of CBRN weapons are taken seriously, especially in
the USA, where media, fascinated by new weapons of mass destruction,
encourage a growing fear for public safety. Terrorists who have
significant human and material resources are much more likely to realize
their intentions than lone perpetrators or small terrorist groups. A
CBRN terrorism threat is certainly a matter of concern; however,
terrorists will face many obstacles in the implementation of an attack
of this kind. This includes the acquisition of materials and preparation
for spreading them as well as a selection and a survey of a chosen
objective and a correct dose required to achieve a desired effect. The
growing threat of CBRN terrorism Terrorism can be defined as a
deliberate act of violence intended to cause damage, but also to create
an appropriate political and ideological situation, so that the use of
these non-traditional weapons of terror outside the context is obvious,
and the goals will not be military, but civilian ones (Bioterrorism,
chemical weapons, and radiation terrorism, nd). Toxic substances,
regardless of whether they are of animal, vegetable or mineral origin,
were used throughout the history for political assassinations and
sabotage; despite the risk of severe penalties, the prospects for
success favoured the use of toxic substances. Such use has always been
reduced, however, since only a small number of people had access to
substances and possessed the ability of learn how to use them (Pascal,
1999). **[[CBRN]{.mark} weapons]{.underline}** are rightly viewed with a
special sense of horror, their **[[effects can be devastating and
indiscriminating]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and they take the most
stringent toll among the most vulnerable population,
non-combatants]{.underline} (e.g. [[a bio]{.mark}logical [attack]{.mark}
[cannot be detected]{.mark} sufficiently [fast after]{.mark} the
[disease spreads]{.mark} through the population]{.underline}). Moreover,
[[chemical and]{.mark} [bio]{.mark}logical [weapons are a]{.mark}
particularly attractive [alternative for]{.mark} groups that do not have
the ability to produce [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, and this
risk raises complex but important ethical issues (London, 2003). The
common name for CBRN terrorism which causes the death of a large number
of people, large scale damage and a strong echo worldwide is
post-industrial or hyper-terrorism. This means that non-state elements
possess and dispose of assets that were previously held only by states,
but unlike them, which often fear reprisals after WMD attacks,
terrorists, having no geographical location, are ready to use WMD with
much less scrupulousness and fear (Kurmnik, Ribnikar, 2003). Some
authors have described the [factors that make **c**hemical,
**b**iological, **r**adiological and **n**uclear terrorist attacks in
many ways unique and demanding, such as an element **of surprise,
invisible agents, ordnance, the risk of repetition and new types of
risks**]{.underline} (Ruggiero, Voss, 2015). In the past 30 years, the
use of CBRN weapons has become a major concern for many nations around
the world. The public has become insensitive to traditional terrorist
attacks that seem to be a less efficient way for terrorist organizations
to achieve their goals. What causes shock and fear is actually
presenting the properties of weapons which can be used by terrorist
organizations to enhance their efforts and the effectiveness of attacks.
CBRN terrorism is often a synonym for weapons of mass destruction,
although this form of terrorism and related incidents do not require
attacks and inflicting harm to large numbers of people - they do not
even require deadly attacks at all. The number of studies on this type
of terrorism is limited due to the lack of available data on this
terrorism type. There is a very small number of databases of CBRN
incidents, and even the existing ones have relatively little to do with
them and they are compared to conventional terrorism (Jesse, 2012). Some
experts emphasize the factors that promote such attacks and these
factors include the availability of information and expertise, increased
frustration of terrorists, demonization of the target population, as
well as a millennial, apocalyptic or messianic vision. Experts also
differ in opinion when it comes to possible perpetrators of CBRN
incidents, and include religious fundamentalists and cults1 as possible
perpetrators of such attacks, especially when these groups address to
ethereal audience, emphasizing the hatred of unbelievers (Ivanova,
Sandler, 2007). Concerns about super terrorism which involves the use of
CBRN weapons are mainly focused on what terrorists can do in the context
of our social reality, with an emphasis on terrorist motivations,
initiatives and limitations. When considering which terrorist groups may
be inclined to commit CBRN terrorism, it is important to recognize the
spectrum of these acts, as well as to analyze the following
categorization: (a) massive casualty events produced by conventional
weapons; (b) CBRN scams; (c) conventional attack on a nuclear facility;
(d) limited-scale chemical or biological attack or a radiological
dispersion; (e) large scale chemical or biological attack or a
radiological dispersion; and (f) CBRN strikes (super terrorism) that can
lead to thousands of victims. In addition to the motivation and
willingness to inflict mass casualties in any way, terrorists must have
technical and financial capabilities to come into possession of material
and acquire skills for these types of weapons and materials and carry
out a successful attack. Chemical and biological weapons can pose a risk
to terrorists thus deterring them from using such weapons (Post, 2005,
pp.148-151). The possibility that terrorists use chemical or biological
substances may increase over the next decade, according to US
intelligence agencies. According to CIA2 , **[[an interest among]{.mark}
non-state actors, including [terrorists, for biological and chemical
materials is real and growing, and the number of]{.mark} potential
[perpetrators is increasing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The agency also
noted that [many of these groups had developed an international network
and did not need to rely on state sponsors for financial and technical
support]{.underline}. However, it is believed that it is less likely
that terrorists would choose chemical and biological weapons over
conventional explosives, because these weapons are difficult to control
and their results are unpredictable (Condesman, Burke, 2001). **[The
risk of CBRN weapons is growing since terrorists are better acquainted
with these agents and their potential for causing harm]{.underline}**3 .
These agents possess desirable characteristics as weapons of terror;
they are biologically invisible to the naked eye, odorless and
potentially lethal in the form of particles; natural organisms are so
readily available, and can be \"camouflaged\" in natural disasters and
used to spread fear and various diseases. Chemical agents quickly attack
the critical physiological centers of the body, disabling or killing the
victim. Biological and chemical weapons require the application of huge
amounts of resources and result in different effects, causing fear and
panic in the contaminated areas. Often referred to as \"weapons of mass
destruction\", but, in medical terms, they are weapons of potential mass
casualties because they can lead to massive death toll in the absence of
preventive measures and timely response (Meyer, Spinella, 2014,
pp.645-656). \"Bioterrorism is the intentional use of microorganisms or
toxins derived from living organisms used for hostile purposes intended
to cause disease or death in man, animals and plants, on which they
depend\". [[The threat of bioterrorist attacks is real]{.mark}, [and
each individual is a potential terrorist]{.mark}, when terrorists are
\"invisible\" prior to an attack [which]{.mark} also [can be
\"invisible\" in the form of causing infectious disea-ses or
epidemics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Citizens who are not aware they are
infected are potential safety hazard and so-called dangerous
bodies]{.underline} (Mijalković, 2011). In the last ten years, the issue
of CBRN weapons has attracted the attention of experts, but a list of
priorities by the heads of states has never been established. Biological
weapons almost became forgotten after they had been banned by the 1972
Convention on Biological Weapons. A significant attention was paid to
them during the 90s of the last century. [The important thing is that
[biological weapons attract much less attention than other similar
weapons, but]{.mark} probably [represent the greatest danger]{.mark},
and in addition to their use in war, they are available as instruments
of terror in peace.]{.underline} Some countries showed willingness to
use such weapons against defenseless populations to achieve strategic
objectives, and in this regard, some analysts believe that those who
attacked the World Trade Center in 1993 applied cyanide on their bombs
(this was not confirmed, but a large amount of cyanide was found in
possession of the perpetrators). Such a group will prove to be less
inefficient, because if terrorists decide to shock and surprise the
government by inflicting enormous damage, CBRN weapons will become more
attractive and more accessible (Bettis, 1998). Motives and forms of
behavior of individuals and groups who acquired or used CBRN weapons
have existed since long ago and there is no doubt that modern society is
vulnerable to such attacks (Tucker, 2000). Fear of biological terrorism
is certainly greater than the fear of the conventional forms of
terrorism; some of these fears are justified and some are often
exaggerated. [Some agents are really very contagious and deadly, and if
used properly, have a potential to result in casualties similar to those
in a nuclear attack]{.underline}. Perhaps the scariest aspect of
biological weapons is that the body is attacked without warning, people
are afraid of the threat as it is invisible, and cannot be heard or
felt. The history of warfare, terrorism and crime involving biological
agents in the last century is considerably less dangerous and more
deadly than the history of conventional warfare (Parachini, 2001).
[Today, some states and some terrorist groups can more easily overcome
technological barriers due to [the]{.mark} increased flow of information
and access to previously unavailable technologies.]{.underline} **[Along
with nuclear and chemical weapons, biological weapons are part of an
[unholy trinity of w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction]{.underline}** (Davis, Johnson-Winegar, 2000,
pp.15-28). **[The society is now faced with the [threat]{.mark} of [an
apocalyptic and asymmetric war scenario in which kamikaze attackers are
able to arm themselves with WMD4]{.mark}]{.underline}** without even
having to have a \"physical\" weapon to create fear; they probably still
prefer simple, proven methods: a stampede in an enclosed place, or just
an explosive device, which will kill many people5 (Palmer, 2004,
pp.3-9). Early detection and response to biological or chemical
terrorism are crucial to solving this problem (U.S. Congress House,
2003, p.117).

#### Ratifying the ATT activates transparency mechanisms that regulate the illicit arms market and prevent conflict \-\-- outweighs nuke war

Caroline **Cliff 16**, Chair, Council Working Group on Conventional Arms
Exports (COARM), EEAS, November 3^rd^, 2016, "Combating the trafficking
of small arms and light weapons",
https://www.iiss.org/-/media/images/dialogues/eunp/eunp-2016/documents/combating-the-trafficking-of-small-arms-and-light-weapons-\_-iiss.ashx

As most of you know, **[Mexico has been an active promoter of adopting,
reviewing, strengthening national and international measures to prevent
and combat illicit trafficking on the small arms and light
weapons]{.underline}**. Why? Constant episodes that we watch every day
around the world show us that **[[small arms and light weapons are an
element of destabilisation. They exacerbate conflicts, fuel organised
crime and terrorism, endanger the rule of law, contribute to the
violation of human rights]{.mark} and of international humanitarian
law.]{.underline}**

**[[Illicit trafficking also hinders economic and social
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the consolidation of the rule of
law. And it is precisely because of the power of destruction of these
weapons and because of the fact that **[they undermine
development]{.underline}**, that **[international
community]{.underline}**, let us not forget, **[has decided to
include]{.underline}**, as part of the agenda of sustainable
development, objective 16, **[a universal commitment to reduce the flow
of illicit weapons in the world.]{.underline}**

For Mexico, nationally for us to counter illicit trafficking, are
entirely related to the safety of our people and their development. Why?
Because **[it is estimated that between 45 -- 80 million small arms and
light weapons are circulating among individuals or groups in Latin
America with little or no control.]{.underline}** Gunshots kill 80,000
people each year in Latin America, which unfortunately has become the
region with the highest rate of homicides committed by firearms. But let
us not forget that the US is not far behind, 33,000. So **[[illicit
trade of these weapons is global.]{.underline}]{.mark}** And **[[the
activity of traffickers undermines the security of most states in the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

This is why we believe the **[international community should tackle
illicit trafficking from both its technical aspects and the human
consequences under an approach of shared responsibility]{.underline}**.
In the past two decades **[[international community has adopted measures
and established mechanism to prevent and eradicate]{.mark} trafficking
of [these weapons, including]{.mark}]{.underline}** the Palermo
Protocol, the problem of action, most recently **[[the
ATT]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and as well as unilateral efforts by OAS and
ECOWAS.

**[These measures]{.underline}**, mechanism, are not only focused on the
illicit aspects of the arms market but sometimes they
**[incorporate]{.underline}** general elements of **[arms
embargos]{.underline}**, technical aspects of transfers such as
**[common criterias for exports]{.underline}**, as well as **[stockpile
management, marking and tracing of weapons, management of ammunitions,
destruction of surplus arms and weapons. [The key humanitarian
perspective has]{.mark} also [been incorporated]{.mark}, particularly
[in the ATT, by including early warning mechanisms for the prevention of
conflicts, crisis management and post-conflict recovery and
rehabilitation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

According to different estimations, **[in 2001 there were at least 550
million firearms in the world]{.underline}**, including arms used by the
police, government forces, militias as well as privately owned weapons.
But in spite of all efforts, it is estimated that **[today there are
approximately 875 million of the small arms in the world. Most of these
weapons can be potentially diverted and trafficked and can feed the
illicit world.]{.underline}**

No wonder some argue that the **[[small weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
as Klaus just said, since they **[[cause more damage than nuclear
weapons]{.mark} effectively]{.underline}**, that **[we should be paying
more attention to them]{.underline}**. Well, as a staunch promoter of
nuclear disarmament, I would say that we can and we should do both. It
is therefore essential to start reflecting how the tools and measures at
our disposal can be implemented in a way that has a real effect against
the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons.

Let us take the ATT, for example. The ATT -- and I would not quote from
the treaty as I presume most of you are familiar with it, but its main
objective is preventing and eradicating the illicit trade in combination
of arms and prevent their diversion. As Mexico is not anymore in the
Chair and we can take the floor again, we do not have to be neutral. So
we can say what we really believe, which was something that we could not
do for a whole year; it is a long period. **[[The ATT will only be
effective if adequately implemented and if
universal]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The question here is what does
adequately implemented mean and how an adequate implementation can
affect universalisation.

**[[Mexico is of the view that the ATT is much more than just a set of
guidelines]{.mark} to establish national export control mechanisms and a
closed network of national experts who exchange information about arms
trade.]{.underline}** **[The ATT can only be effective by preventing
illicit international trade, exposing inconstancies that may trigger
investigations and]{.underline}**, if appropriate, **[punishment by the
relevant national authorities.]{.underline}** If the ATT does not do
that, it will not be doing its job. **[[The only way to do it is by
publically disclosing and openly discussing information about the
transfer of arms around the globe]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And to get
there we believe that a mechanism to review implementation of the treaty
would be essential. The problem is that as some argue -- and not without
reason -- a broad interpretation of the obligations of the treaty may
create disincentives for non-state parties to join the regime

### Scenario 2 \-\-- Middle East 

#### International arm sales to the Middle East violate the ATT \-\-\-- ratifying is key to end sales and prevent the dispersion of illicit weapons

Many of the articles of **[the ATT have direct relevance to the
situation in [Yemen]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Article 1 states that the treaty's purpose includes reduction of human
suffering. Evidence from UN investigations indicates that the **[[air
strikes and ground operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which have killed
civilians and destroyed residential buildings, civilian industrial
factory complexes, hospitals, and marketplaces,
**[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely **[[contributed to violations of
international humanitarian and]{.mark} [h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights
[laws]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

It is almost certain that coalition airstrikes have not met
international humanitarian law requirements of proportionality and
precautions. Some attacks may constitute war crimes. **[The UN human
rights chief has accused the Saudi-led coalition of causing twice as
many civilian casualties as all the other forces fighting in
Yemen.]{.underline}**

**[Selling arms to perpetrators of such actions]{.underline}** could

the ATT.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Articles 6 and 7]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Prohibitions and Export
Assessment), **[[require States]{.mark} Parties to carry out a
comprehensive risk assessment prior to authorization of the export of
conventional arms. States Parties must]{.underline}**, inter alia,

**[The need for effective arms transfer and SALW controls]{.underline}**

**[[Within the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}** and North Africa, a
wide range of **[arms proliferation and arms transfer dynamics generate
significant security challenges]{.underline}**. These are too numerous
to discuss in detail but three in particular are worth highlighting: (a)
**[[diversion and stockpile leakage]{.mark} in post-conflict
settings]{.underline}**; (b) **[[the transfer of arms to non-state
actors; and]{.mark}]{.underline}** (c) **[[significant]{.mark} and
ongoing [military build-ups by states]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These
dynamics **[[underline the need for more effective arms transfer]{.mark}
and SALW controls in the region]{.underline}** while also demonstrating
the challenges involved in achieving this goal.

Post-conflict diversion and stockpile leakage

Patterns of arms trafficking in the Middle East and North Africa are
often significantly affected by external shocks such as the eruption of
a new conflict.4 In particular, **[a pattern of [large military
build-ups followed by conflict and the collapse of government control
has led to significant increases in]{.mark} the volume of [illicit
SALW]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to the Small Arms Survey, **[the
2003 Iraq war resulted in the transfer of at least 4.2 million SALW from
the military to armed non-state actors or the wider civilian
population]{.underline}**, as a result of either the government's
pre-invasion arming of militia forces or the post-invasion looting of
stockpiles.**[5 Combined with [transfers from neighbouring
states]{.mark} and battlefield captures, these weapons [formed the basis
of the arsenals that fuelled the anti-coalition insurgency and internal
conflicts]{.mark} in Iraq that began in 2003.6 In Libya, the collapse of
the Gaddafi regime in 2011 made possible the looting of poorly guarded
stockpiles. Libya witnessed the rapid emergence of illicit weapons
markets while wider and freer access to the internet facilitated their
illicit sale online.]{.underline}**7 **[In both Iraq and Libya the loss
of arms did not just affect neighbouring states but led to proliferation
in the wider region]{.underline}**.8 For example, refugee flows from
Libya to Tunisia during the revolution also involved the transfer of
significant amounts of civilian held small arms that were not controlled
at the border.9 Weapons from Libyan stockpiles also spread to most of
West Africa.10

**[[Stockpile leakage and diversion]{.underline}]{.mark}**---whether due
to corruption, weak stockpile management or the loss of government
control after the collapse of a state---**[[have fed illicit
markets]{.mark}, upended existing trading patterns [and contributed to
instabilities by arming populations and non-state groups.
National]{.mark}]{.underline}** and regional **[[measures
are]{.underline}]{.mark}** therefore **[[needed to improve stockpile
management of SALW and ammunition]{.underline}]{.mark}**, strengthen
border controls and ensure accountable destruction of surplus weapons
after a war **[[in order to reduce proliferation-related
instability]{.mark} and security challenges. The collapse of state
institutions that occurred in Iraq and Libya would have created a loss
of weapons from state stockpiles regardless of the type of standards
then in place.]{.underline}** Nonetheless, particularly in Libya, the
low standards in existence before the conflict were widely known and
greatly exacerbated the problems that arose later. Prior to 2011,
**[Libya had 'one of the largest and most diverse stockpiles of
conventional weapons' in Africa and one of the world's highest rates of
civilian gun ownership.11 Libya was also a key source of illicit weapon
transfers to its neighbouring states]{.underline}**, a trade that was
largely controlled by groups operating along Libya's borders, reportedly
acting with the consent and oversight of the Gaddafi regime.

Transfers to non-state actors

**[The Middle East and North Africa region has long been and continues
to be plagued by [interstate and intra-state
conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[These conflicts [have created a
significant demand for---and been fuelled by---licit and illicit arms
transfers to and within the region.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A common
phenomenon in many of these conflicts is the transfer or diversion of
arms to non-state actors. Indeed, **[the Middle East and North Africa
provides several examples of a state arming groups to act as proxies,
create instabilities, or protect its specific interests in a
conflict]{.underline}**. For example, many states in the region have a
long history of supplying arms to the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) and Hamas.13 More recently, **[[Iran continues to be accused of
supplying arms to Hezbollah and Houthi forces]{.mark} in
Yemen]{.underline}**.14 In addition, **[[Egypt and the]{.mark} United
Arab Emirates ([UAE]{.mark}) reportedly [played a lead role in supplying
arms to different non-state actors in Libya]{.mark}]{.underline}**
during the anti-Gaddafi uprising.15 Finally, **[[Saudi Arabia, Jordan
and the UAE]{.mark} are reported to [have supplied large quantities of
arms to anti-government forces in Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}**, mainly
through the re-export of weapons acquired in Central and Eastern
Europe.16 Investigations by Conflict Armaments Research have shown that
weapons originally supplied to anti-government forces in Syria formed a
significant proportion of those held by IS.17

**[Hezbollah, non-state actors in Libya, [the]{.mark} Houthi
[forces]{.mark} in Yemen and IS [are all subject to UN arms
embargoes]{.mark}.]{.underline}**18 **[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[while the UN bodies assigned to monitor the implementation of these
embargoes have helped to identify sources of supply for these groups,
[the embargoes themselves have not succeeded in halting
transfers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The creation of a more formalized
**[ban on arms transfers to non-state actors was a central issue for
discussion during the negotiation of the ATT]{.underline}** and
continues to be discussed in the context of the biannual meetings of
states and review conferences attached to the UN POA. In both contexts,
many **[states pushed for language that would outlaw any arms transfer
that has not been approved by both the exporting and the importing
state]{.underline}**. 19 Others---particularly the US
Government---blocked the inclusion of this language, largely because it
wished to retain the option of supplying arms to allied rebel forces.
The positions of the states in the Middle East and North Africa on this
question are mixed. Syria has voiced strong support for such
language---particularly since the start of the ongoing conflict in the
country---and cited the failure to include it in the ATT as one of the
main reasons why it blocked the adoption of the treaty by consensus at
the 2013 negotiating conference.20 Other states have maintained more
ambiguous positions. For example, it has been argued that if the USA had
not blocked the adoption of language on this point in the UN POA, Iran
and a number of Arab states would have been more vocal in their
opposition to its inclusion.21

Significant and ongoing military build-ups

**[States in the Middle East and North Africa rely heavily on imports
for their acquisitions of conventional arms and SALW]{.underline}**.
**[Some [states in the region have started]{.mark} or continue [to build
up]{.mark} domestic [industries]{.mark} and build facilities for
licensed arms production, especially [for SALW and
ammunition]{.mark}.]{.underline}** However, with a few exceptions they
lack the established arms industries required to meet the demand from
domestic, regional or global markets. Israel is a prominent exception,
in that it maintains the most developed arms industry in the region,
producing technologically advanced weapon systems for states all over
the world. Israeli exports of major weapons increased by 55 per cent
between 2008--12 and 2013--17.22 Very few of these exports supplied the
regional arms market, however, due to the protracted Arab-Israeli
conflict.

Many states in the Middle East and North Africa are currently in the
midst of significant military build-ups. Saudi Arabia had the third
largest military spending in the world in 2017, albeit far behind the
USA and China. In addition, seven of the 10 countries with the highest
military spending as a proportion of their gross domestic product (GDP)
are in the Middle East.23 Of the world's 10 largest importers of major
arms in the period 2013--17, five were in the Middle East and North
Africa.24

**[[The size of these build-ups highlights the need for openness and
transparency]{.mark} about what is being acquired and for what
purposes[, in order to defuse potential misunderstandings and build
trust and confidence.]{.mark}]{.underline}** At the same time, the
transfers themselves have also been the centre of debates about Western
supplier states' export controls. **[During the period of the Arab
Spring]{.underline}** uprisings in several states in the Middle East and
North Africa, **[Western states were strongly criticized by
parliamentarians and civil society for exporting arms to states that
were using their military forces against protestors or to suppress
opposition]{.underline}**.25 **[More recently, arms exports from the USA
and Europe to Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also been criticized due to
the conduct of their forces in the ongoing war in Yemen. Public debates
and [controversies over export licensing practices have
highlighted]{.mark}]{.underline}** disagreements over **[[the
interpretation and implementation of]{.underline}]{.mark}**---in
particular---**[[the ATT's obligations on preventing the export of arms
that will be used to violate human rights or IHL]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**\*SALW -- Small Arms and Light Weapons**

One of the regions in which **[the need for effective arms transfer and
SALW controls is most acute]{.underline}**---and **[for]{.underline}**
targeted cooperation **[and assistance work the greatest---is [the
Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}** and North Africa. **[The region is
[currently suffering under]{.mark} the weight of a range of [armed
conflicts]{.mark} that are [fed]{.mark} by [licit and illicit arms
flows]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In particular, **[[the
prolif]{.mark}eration and diversion [of illicit]{.mark}
[SALW]{.mark}]{.underline}** have **[[fuel]{.underline}]{.mark}**led
**[[civil wars and other conflicts]{.mark}, such as those [in Syria,
Yemen and Libya]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, **[trafficked and
diverted weapons arm terrorist organizations, such as]{.underline}** the
Islamic State group (**[IS]{.underline}**) **[and al-Qaeda, [that
threaten local populations, destabilize states, conquer territory,
divert resources and commit acts of international
terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The ways in which these weapon
flows reach these groups underscore the need for better standards in
both arms transfer and SALW controls]{.underline}**. At the same time,
**[many of [the states]{.mark} in the region [are engaged in ambitious
military build-ups that]{.mark} have the potential to further [undermine
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** often **[limited [levels of interstate trust
and confidence]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[These build-ups underline the
need for effective processes for]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[both arms
procurement and [arms import controls]{.mark} to ensure that any arms
acquired are in line with national needs [and]{.mark} reach their
intended end-users. They also highlight the [need for effective measures
on transparency and reporting]{.mark}]{.underline}**---a key component
of any effective arms transfer control system---so that states' true
intentions are not misconstrued. That said, while the need is there, the
willingness and ability of states in the Middle East and North Africa to
participate in cooperation and assistance activities aimed at building
capacity in arms transfer and SALW controls is lower than in other parts
of the world. **[The same challenges [that]{.mark} highlight the need
for strengthened controls also [lead to higher levels of regional
instability and lower levels of state capacity]{.mark}, making it harder
for national authorities to formulate their needs effectively, and
engage with and absorb any assistance provided.]{.underline}** At the
same time, **[[the engagement of states with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
relevant international instruments in this area---particularly the
**[[ATT]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[has been]{.underline}]{.mark}**
more **[[limited]{.underline}]{.mark}** than in other parts of the
world, which means that certain avenues for assistance provision are not
open.

Migration, **[[regional instability]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** great-power conflict. **[[Civil
war]{.mark}s]{.underline}** are also **[dangerous because they [could
lead to]{.mark}]{.underline}** greater refugee flows, regional
destabilization, and **[[great-power
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Not [every civil war has the potential
for ]{.underline}**generating these global crises**[, but
if ]{.underline}**generated**, they would be a product not just of civil
strife but also of policy choices that were made by advanced
industrialized countries. In this regard, they should be contrasted with
possible pandemics and transnational terrorism that, arguably, would
occur regardless of the policies adopted by wealthy democratic states.
As Sarah Lischer\'s essay shows, the number of migrants--especially
people displaced by civil wars--has increased dramatically in recent
years.4 Most of these migrants have been generated by three conflicts,
those in Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia. The wave of migrants entering
Western Europe has destabilized traditional politics and contributed to
the success of Brexit in the UK, the increased share of votes secured by
right-wing parties in a number of Western European countries, and the
electoral gains of a number of right-wing parties in Eastern Europe.
Anxiety about immigration contributed to Donald Trump\'s victory in the
United States. European countries, even those on the left like Sweden,
have responded to rising numbers of refugees by tightening the rules for
potential migrants. The European Union reached a deal with Turkey in
2016 to provide financial resources in exchange--among other things--for
an increase in acceptance of refugees. At the same time,
the sheer number of
refugees in Jordan andLebanon can potentially undermine government
control in those countries. The impact of **[[civil
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}** in one country can
**[[spread]{.underline}]{.mark}** to surrounding areas. ISIL\'s
ambitious campaigns have afflicted Syria and Iraq. Civil strife in
Somalia has, as Seyoum Mesfin and Abdeta Beyene write, influenced the
policies of Ethiopia.5 The FARC insurgency in Colombia impacted
Venezuela and Ecuador. Conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) drew in several neighboring states. Some regional conflicts have
resulted in millions of deaths, most notably the war in the DRC, with
limited impact on and attention from wealthy industrialized
countries. **[[Wars in the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
however, **[have been more
consequential]{.underline}** because they have **[[led to the
involvement of Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the United States, they
are closer to Europe and have therefore generated more refugees,
and **[[Middle Eastern oil is]{.mark} [a global
commodity]{.mark}]{.underline}** on which much of the world depends.
Regional destabilization in the Middle East does matter for the West;
regional destabilization in Central Africa may only matter for those who
live in the neighborhood. [**[Direct
confrontation]{.underline}** **[between]{.underline}** **[major
powers]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[has not occurred
since]{.underline}]{.mark}** the end of **[[World War
II]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In well-governed
areas, [where ]{.underline}**civil wars**[ are absent]{.underline},
the likelihood of great-power conflict is small. Territorial conquest
has been delegitimized (though Russia\'s annexation of Crimea stands as
a recent exception to this norm). The existence of nuclear weapons has
removed uncertainty about the costs of a confrontation between
nuclear-armed states with assured second-strike
capability. **[[Great-power confrontations are]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
however**[, [more likely in areas]{.mark} that are [afflicted by civil
strife, because instability and appeals]{.mark}]{.underline}** from
local actors **[[could draw in major]{.mark} state [actors with vested
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is especially true for the Middle
East. Moreover, in countries on the periphery of Russia that were
formerly part of the Soviet Union, especially those with sizeable
Russian ethnic populations, the government in Moscow has demonstrated
that it can increase the level of internal unrest. There is no guarantee
of stability, even in countries that might have been stable absent
external support for dissident groups that would otherwise have remained
quiescent.

### Scenario 3 \-\-- Africa

#### Terrorism in Africa is increasing---lack of Global cooperation proliferates their motives

Ruchita **Beri** 20**17**, Senior Research Associate at the Institute
for Defence Studies and Analysis, April 13^th^ 2017, "Rise of Terrorism
in Africa",

**[The recent terror attack]{.underline}** by al Shabaab in the port
city of Barawe in southern Somalia, a suicide bomb attack by Boko Haram
in Maiduguri in Nigeria, and an attack on a military post in Mali [**by
an [al Qaeda-linked terror group]{.mark} [have]{.mark} [brought]{.mark}
the [focus]{.mark} [back]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [terrorism in]{.mark} the
[Africa]{.mark}n continent**.]{.underline} [Over the years, terrorism
has become the most important challenge to peace, security and
development in Africa. **The terror [activities have grown exponentially
in the continent]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} not only in terms of the number of
attacks but also the number of countries affected due to increased
proliferation of terrorist groups.]{.underline}

In terms of statistics, according to the IHS Jane's Terrorism and
Insurgency Centre, **[the [terror attacks by radical groups in Africa
have increased by 200 per cent]{.mark} and fatalities by more than 750
per cent during 2009-2015.]{.underline}**1 A number of **[groups have
been terrorising the civilians and governments alike in several parts of
Africa. While global terror groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria ([ISIS) and al Qaeda have made their presence felt in the
region,]{.mark} other local groups too have gained prominence over the
years.]{.underline}** The deadliest of these are Boko Haram, al Qaeda in
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and al Shabaab. As a result, an arc of
instability is spreading across Africa, from Nigeria in West Africa,
Mali in Sahel, Libya in North Africa, to Somalia in East Africa.

In Nigeria, Boko Haram (meaning Western education is sin) continues to
target civilians and government infrastructure despite several rounds of
operation conducted by the Nigerian Army. Boko Haram, that came up in
2009, had emerged as the 'world's deadliest terrorist organisation' by
2014. [In the last eight years, **it is said that Boko Haram has taken
20,000 lives, displaced 2.6 million people, created 75,000 orphans and
caused about nine billion worth of damage**.2 [Links with the ISIS, with
leadership]{.mark} tussle between Abubakar Shekau and ISIS favouring Abu
Musab al-Barnawi, [have turned]{.mark} the situation more
[complex.]{.mark}]{.underline} While there may have been some reduction
in Boko Haram-led violence in the country due the Nigerian Army's
counter terrorism campaign, the group continues to expand its operations
in neighbouring countries such as Cameroon, Niger and Chad.3

[In Sahel, there is a resurgence of al Qaeda. The **[four]{.mark}
terrorist [groups]{.mark} that [continue to wreak havoc]{.mark}** in the
region - AQIM, Mokhtar Belmokhtar's al Mourabitoun, Ansar Dine and
Macina Liberation Front - have recently decided to combine forces and
merge into a single group called Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen
(Group for Support of Islam and Muslims]{.underline}).4 They have also
pledged allegiance to the al Qaeda leadership. This regrouping of terror
groups is ominous for countries such as Mali and the neighbouring Niger,
Cote d' Ivoire and Burkina Faso that have borne the brunt of their
attacks in the past.

[In Somalia, the notorious al Shabaab is on the offensive and in recent
months has taken control of some towns after defeating the troops of the
African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).]{.underline}5 The group has
increased its attacks on African Union bases, Somali government
facilities, targets in neighbouring Kenya and, for the first time in a
show of strength, has also launched attacks in the northern Puntland
autonomous region. This comes as a surprise as the al Shabaab had
steadily lost ground over the last six years. It lost control of the
capital Mogadishu in 2011 and then was pushed out of Somalia's major
cities by the 22,000-strong African Union force deployed in the country.

[The [withdrawal]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [Ethiopian troops]{.mark} from
Somalia and the announcement by the African Union to withdraw AMISOM too
(triggered primarily by reduction in funding by the European Union),
[may have been to]{.mark} an extent responsible for [al Shabaab's
comeback]{.mark}]{.underline}. The attacks in the north may be a move to
regain control by the pro-al Qaeda al Shabaab leadership, after the
recent declaration of allegiance to ISIS by Abdul Qadir Meemen, leader
of the faction based in Puntland.6 Another issue of concern is the
possibility of revival of friendship between the al Qaeeda of Arabian
Peninsula (AQAP) and al Shabaab. In the past, al Shabaab is reported to
have trained cadre along with AQAP. [[The]{.mark} Saudi
[Arabia]{.mark}-led [war]{.mark} against Houthis in Yemen [seems to have
benefitted the AQAP]{.mark}.7 [This group appears to have rapidly gained
control over chunks of territory in Yemen.]{.mark} The emergence of
nexus between al Shabaab and AQAP could make the situation in Somalia
deadlier.]{.underline}

The ISIS plan to establish a caliphate in North Africa was thwarted
after it was routed out of Sirte, the last ISIS strong hold, in December
2016 by the Libyan National Army, with air support provided by the
United States (US). [Since 2014, **[pro-ISIS terrorist groups have been
active in North Africa]{.mark}**, particularly in Tunisia and Libya. In
Libya, the instability following the collapse of the Muammar al Gaddafi
regime, and the presence of numerous indigenous factions and also the
porous borders, provided a fertile ground for the expansion of ISIS in
the country.]{.underline} Moreover, Libya's long unmonitored coastline
too provided the ISIS with a channel to Europe. Between 2014 and 2016,
ISIS expanded its presence in multiple cities in Libya, including Derna,
Benghazi and Sirte. While the terror group was driven out of most of the
region under its control, there are chances that remnants of the group
may reconstitute and again create problems.

[In Tunisia, Ansar al-Sharia, an ISIS affiliate, has been responsible
for a large number of terror attacks in the country. It has also been
the main facilitator of ISIS fighters from the country to West
Asia]{.underline}. Tunisia, has earned the ignominious tag of being the
key recruitment ground for the ISIS (about 6,500) in Syria and Iraq.89

[ISIS is recruiting youth from eastern as well as southern Africa to
fight its wars in Syria and Libya. In Kenya, coastal Tanzania and
Zanzibar, youth from the Muslim communities are vulnerable to the ISIS
recruitment drives.]{.underline} Reports suggest that at least 140 youth
from South Africa may have joined the ISIS.10 These terrorist outfits
are using both internet as well as networks of radical clerics to lure
the youth from the region.

[[**There is a growing recognition in Africa that terrorism is** a
transnational problem]{.mark} and, therefore, there is a need for
cooperation at the continental level to effectively deal with
it]{.underline}.11 Over the years, African countries have devised
various measures to deal with this threat at the pan-African level. The
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Convention on the Prevention and
Combating of Terrorism, adopted at Algiers in 1999, had put in place a
solid framework to deal with the scourge of terrorism.12 It not only
defined terrorism but also laid out areas of cooperation among the
member states as well as guidelines for the extradition. This was
followed by a Plan of Action on Prevention and Combating terrorism in
2002, which put forward several measures for border surveillance, issue
of machine readable passports, checking illegal transfer of weapons,
introduction of legislation preventing the financing of terrorism, and
sharing of information and intelligence on terror activities.13 The Plan
of Action incorporated international standards for combating terrorism,
in line with the provisions of the UNSC Resolution 1373 of September 28,
2001. It also called for the establishment of the African Centre for the
Study and Research on Terrorism (ACSRT).

However, the most important instrument is the 2004 Protocol to the 1999
Algiers Convention. This Protocol recognised the "linkages between
terrorism and mercenarism, weapons of mass destruction, drug
trafficking, corruption, transnational crimes, money laundering and
illicit proliferation of small arms".14 The Protocol also addressed a
major weakness of the 1999 Convention, which is, lack of an
implementation mechanism. The 2004 Protocol mandated the African Union's
Peace and Security Council to monitor and facilitate the implementation.

[Unfortunately, despite the existence of these instruments, **terror
[networks continue to operate in the region.]{.mark}** This is [mainly
due to]{.mark} the [tardy implementation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the counter
terrorism [framework]{.mark} by the member states]{.underline}. For
example, the 2004 Counter Terrorism Protocol needed ratification by
minimum 15 states before it could come into force. However, it took more
than a decade to finally operationalise this key instrument in 2014.
Moreover, some of the key states facing terror attacks such as Nigeria,
Kenya, Somalia and Chad are yet to ratify it.[15 Much of the delay has
to do with insufficient financial resources and lack of necessary
political will amongst African states to implement it. A large number of
countries do not have the funds to enforce the counter-terrorism
measures]{.underline}. For example, bonder fencing would be extremely
costly and most of the states are in a dilemma about utilising the
limited development-oriented funds for such tasks.16 Also, a large
number of African countries, while understanding the transnational
nature of terrorism, shy away from seeking external intervention or
support as it is considered a challenge to their national sovereignty.

[Another important factor could be the very nature of states in
Africa.1]{.underline}7 Most of the counter measures to deal with
terrorism have dealt with enhancing the capacities of the states in the
continent. However, this has proved to be counterproductive in some
cases, as greed and corruption overwhelmed feelings of nationalism
amongst section of political elites. [For example, it has been reported
that [in Somalia]{.mark} the [arms]{.mark} [transfers from the US found
their way to al Shabaab due **to corruption in the ranks of the Somali
National Army.**]{.mark}**18** Similarly, there are reports that suggest
that Boko Haram may have supporters within the state structures in
Nigeria, particularly in North Nigeria.19]{.underline}

[There is no doubt that **[terrorism is a global problem]{.mark} and
countries across the world including India have for decades suffered
from this scourge.** While the rise in terrorism in Africa may not
impact India directly, [there is no denying the fact that this may not
remain the case in future]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, recent revival of
piracy off Somalia's northern coast, an area often used by al Shabaab,
has reopened the old debate of possible connections between al Shabaab,
AQAP and the pirates.20 The fact that the pirates hijacked an India
dhow, adds to the vulnerability for the country.21 Second, as Nigeria is
India's largest trading partner in Africa, Boko Haram's continued
attacks in the country makes it an issue of concern for India too. At
the Third India Africa Forum Summit in 2015, and during Prime Minister
Narendra Modi's visit to Kenya and South Africa in 2016, the issue of
cooperation in counter-terrorism was raised. As African countries look
towards the international community in their fight against terrorism,
friendly support from India will go a long way in taking the
relationship forward.

#### United States Collaboration is crucial to decrease security risk of African Collapse

Senior Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council,
5/17, "WHY AFRICA MATTERS TO US NATIONAL SECURITY",
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/Why_Africa_Matters_to_US_National_Security_0524_web.pdf>

**[[Terrorist]{.mark} groups based [in]{.mark} [Africa]{.mark} are
inflicting terrible suffering and directly [threaten]{.mark} the
[interests]{.mark} [of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and its
allies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In 2015, the number of people killed in
terrorist attacks in Africa was the same or higher as the number of
fatalities caused by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in the
Middle East.10 [While it cannot be emphasized enough that the vast
majority of this misery has fallen on Africans, terrorist groups also
endanger Americans and US interests.]{.underline}

Multiple [[Africa]{.mark}-[based]{.mark} [groups]{.mark}
[maintain]{.mark} [links]{.mark} [with]{.mark} primary US adversaries
like [ISIS and al-Qaeda]{.mark}]{.underline}, which carried out the
bombings of two US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. More
recently, there are growing concerns about terrorist organizations in
the Sahel with links to al-Qaeda.11 [**[ISIS]{.mark} [has]{.mark} also
[been]{.mark} [looking to Africa to expand its reach]{.mark}**; the
group is fully operational in eighteen countrie United States Africa
Command (AFRICOM), "[Terrorists]{.mark} with allegiances to multiple
groups are expanding their collaboration in recruitment, financing,
training, and operations, both within Africa and
trans-regionally."14]{.underline}

[African-based groups [such as]{.mark} Boko [Haram---the second]{.mark}
most [lethal terrorist group in the world15]{.mark}---and al-Qaeda in
the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) [espouse dangerous anti-American]{.mark}
and/or anti-Western [ideologies.]{.mark}]{.underline} Both have been
responsible for targeting establishments frequented by Westerners,
including attacks by Boko Haram against a United Nations (UN) building
in Nigeria (2011), and by Africa-based al-Qaeda affiliates against
hotels in Mali (2015), Burkina Faso (2016), and Côte d'Ivoire (2016).
AQIM made more than \$90 million kidnapping Europeans for ransom from
2008-2014.16 In addition, [al-Shabaab, which is an affiliate of
al-Qaeda, has conducted various attacks in East Africa, including at a
restaurant and rugby club in Uganda (2010) and the Westgate Mall in
Kenya (2013).]{.underline}

[[Terrorist]{.mark} activities by these groups [do not just pose
localized threats]{.mark}: **[their]{.mark} anti-American
[messages]{.mark} [reach]{.mark} potential [audiences far and
wide]{.mark}**, including [across Africa]{.mark} and in the United
States]{.underline}. Al-Shabaab has solicited US residents and citizens
(including among the approximately 150,000 strong Somali immigrant
community in the United States17) for funding,18 new s, including eight
in Africa (of which three are in North Africa),12 and it secured
allegiance from Boko Haram in Nigeria in 2015.13 As described by a
previous commander of the members,19 and to encourage attacks on US
soil.20 In 2009, Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the "Underwear
Bomber," was inspired by al-Qaeda to attempt to explode an airplane
bound for the United States.21

**[Indeed, the [characteristics]{.mark} [of]{.mark} weak and [failed
states---including corruption, poor governance, and insecurity---breed
terrorist threats]{.mark} by providing safe havens for perpetrators,
avenues for profitable illegal activities, and opportunities to recruit
disaffected individuals. In some cases, [fragile states lack the
capacity to act]{.mark}. In other cases, they may be unwilling to crack
down on terrorism, as when Sudan provided refuge to Osama bin Laden in
the early 1990s.]{.underline}**

In some circumstances**[, the [threats are so pressing that the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} sometimes been left with
little choice but [to]{.mark} [take direct action]{.mark}, which is
greatly facilitated by having a physical foothold in Africa and access
to key infrastructure]{.underline}**. As a case in point, Camp Lemonnier
in Djibouti is critical to US counterterrorism efforts on the continent
and in the Middle East, including operations against al-Shabaab in
Somalia and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen.22

Ultimately, however, **[[successful]{.mark} [counterterrorism]{.mark}
endeavors [require]{.mark} motivated and [capable]{.mark}
[partners]{.mark}. [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could not do it
alone even if it wanted to]{.mark}---it would be an unwise investment
and, more to the point, ineffective. In addition to direct military
action, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must invest in
strengthening partners' ability to confront and prevent regional
threats]{.mark}, including before they can escalate [and]{.mark} affect
US interests (abroad, and especially at home).]{.underline}** This
includes providing vital security cooperation and assistance to increase
African partner capacity, which is neither a quick nor a small task**[.
Mounting [a]{.mark} meaningful security [relationship]{.mark} depends
[on]{.mark} strong [diplomacy]{.mark} and building partnerships [across
military, law enforcement, intelligence, and other channels. It may also
require]{.mark}, as in the case of Nigeria or Kenya,
[confronting]{.mark} [human]{.mark} [rights]{.mark} [issues]{.mark} to
ensure compliance with US laws (e.g., Leahy human rights vetting of
foreign security forces) that would otherwise prevent the US provision
of certain types of assistance to specific units or
individuals.]{.underline}** In contrast, divorcing short-term
counterterrorism operations from a deeper partnership that incorporates
security and other assistance to African states could backfire if
partner states lack the necessary will or ability to pursue
comprehensive and effective strategies.

#### African instability kills cooperation over epidemics\-\--failure risks illness, bioterror and death

Grant T **Harris 2017**, Special Assistant to the President and Senior
Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, 5/17,
"WHY AFRICA MATTERS TO US NATIONAL SECURITY",
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/Why_Africa_Matters_to_US_National_Security_0524_web.pdf

First, [**[US leadership has been critical in reducing]{.mark} the
direct and indirect [impacts of]{.mark} devastating [epidemics]{.mark}**
in Africa.]{.underline} The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPFAR) created under President George W. Bush saved some 740,000 lives
over four years.31 With the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa,
action by the United States and its allies---including military
involvement---helped avoid a worst-case scenario of 1.4 million cases in
four months.32 Early intervention decreased the chances of US citizens
becoming infected, and minimized the possibility of a viral mutation;
had that happened, the risks to the global population would have been
enormous.33

Second[, [the United States cannot]{.mark} completely [isolate]{.mark}
[itself]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the face of such [health
crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the time of the Ebola outbreak, some
3,000---6,000 passengers a week were traveling between West Africa and
the United States.34 [The United States would have been much more
directly impacted---and much sooner---had Ebola been more concentrated
in a country like Nigeria, with greater travel and commercial links to
the United States.]{.underline} Nor is simply closing the borders a
practical response, as illustrated by ineffective travel restrictions to
contain the spread of H1N1 influenza in 2009.35

[[There is]{.mark} also [the risk of weaponizing]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
highly infectious [disease for bioterrorism]{.mark}
purposes.]{.underline} Though the likelihood of this happening with
Ebola is low due to logistical and financial hurdles, that has not
stopped state and non-state actors from trying in the past,36 and the
possibility that such a threat could emanate from Africa should not be
overlooked.

Additionally, [[epidemics]{.mark} can [have]{.mark} long-lasting
[destabilizing effects that undermine US security]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[PEPFAR was founded on the realization that "the devastation caused by
HIV/AIDS would depress economic development, inhibit good governance,
[and decrease the size and productivity of the workforce]{.mark}---
conditions that breed instability and conflict]{.underline}."37 In the
case of Ebola, even though Americans had a slim chance of contracting
the disease, President Obama rightly determined that out-of-control
infections could lead to panic and the economic collapse of affected
African countries, with global security implications.38

Third, [**new and/or [more frequent outbreaks]{.mark} [are a]{.mark}
distinct [possibility]{.mark} in the future, partly [as a result of
growing]{.mark} and urbanizing [populations]{.mark}** in Africa and
elsewhere, and the increased incidence of humanto-animal interactions.
"Emerging diseases against which humans have no preexisting immunity or
effective therapies pose significant risks of becoming
pandemics,"]{.underline} warned former Director of National Intelligence
James Clapper.39

Moreover, [Africa's generally weak national health systems heighten the
likelihood that a localized disease will expand into a
pandemic.]{.underline} For example, [countries in Africa are the least
likely of any region to have pandemic preparedness plans for avian
influenza, which is especially worrying in light of recent outbreaks of
"highly pathogenic" strains that have affected millions of birds across
Europe, Asia, and Africa]{.underline}.40 [**[If these strains succeeded
in transferring to humans]{.mark}**, the Center for Disease Control
(CDC) cautions, "**[a]{.mark}n influenza [pandemic could result]{.mark},
[with]{.mark} potentially high rates of [illness and death
worldwide]{.mark}**.]{.underline}"41

#### Pandemics risk extinction

Johnathan **Quick 18** March 18 2018, "Are we prepared for the looming
epidemic threat?", The Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/end-epidemics-aids-ebola-sars-sunday-essay

[Somewhere out there [a dangerous virus]{.mark} is boiling up in the
bloodstream of a bird, bat, monkey or pig, preparing to jump to a human
being]{.underline}. It's hard to comprehend the scope of such a threat,
for [it [has the potential to wipe out millions]{.mark} of us, including
my family and yours, [over a matter of weeks or months. **The risk makes
the threat posed by Islamic State, a ground war, a massive climate event
or even the dropping of a nuclear bomb on a major city pale by
comparison**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[A new epidemic could turn into a pandemic without
warning]{.underline}**. It could be born in a factory farm in Minnesota,
a poultry farm in China or the bat-inhabited elephant caves of Kenya --
anywhere infected animals are in contact with humans. It could be a
variation of the 1918 Spanish flu, one of hundreds of other known
microbial threats or something entirely new, such as the 2003 Sars virus
that spread globally from China. [Once transmitted to a human, [an
airborne virus could]{.mark} pass from that one [infect]{.mark}ed
individual to [25,000]{.mark} others [within a week]{.mark}, and to
[more than 700,000 within the first month. Within three months, it could
spread to every major urban centre in the world. And by six months, it
could infect more than 300 million people and kill more than 30
million]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[This is not alarmist science fiction.]{.underline}** [It is one of
several highly plausible scenarios -- and far from the worst --
developed by infectious disease specialists working with
disease-modelling experts.]{.underline} Bill Gates, who funds a group
that uses computer simulations to predict the spread of diseases, said:
"The Ebola epidemic showed me that we are not ready for a serious
epidemic, an epidemic that would be more infectious and would spread
faster than Ebola did." He put the likelihood of a catastrophic epidemic
at "well over 50%" in his lifetime.

[Gates's model estimates that [a perilous virus]{.mark}, carried via
cars, planes, ships and trains, and spreading quickly in packed cities,
[could kill up to 33 million people in just over 200
days]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the last century alone, smallpox killed 300 to 500 million people.
The 1918-19 Spanish flu killed 50 to 100 million and Aids has taken 40
million lives since it was first recognised in 1981. The annual
influenza outbreak still claims half a million people a year worldwide.
The west African Ebola crisis took more than 11,000 lives -- seven times
the total of the 22 Ebola epidemics that preceded it. But widespread
death isn't the only threat. For those who survive the initial
infection, an epidemic leaves its own particular trail of disfigurement
and disability. People who contracted smallpox suffered characteristic,
sometimes horrific, scars, along with blindness, limb deformities and
other disabilities. As a lifelong condition, Aids and the side-effects
of treatment can affect nearly every body system, from brain to bone.

[In the early stages of a new epidemic]{.underline} -- before it has
been recognised or how it spreads has been determined, and before
appropriate protection measures are in place -- [health workers die in
high numbers]{.underline}. As with war, where common illness can take
more lives than war injuries, [epidemics sometimes take more lives from
disruption of primary health care than from the epidemic
itself]{.underline}. Because health workers are diverted to emergency
response centres, and health facilities are sometimes closed, epidemics
can also disrupt routine public healthcare needs such as immunisation,
treatment of acute illness and facility-based births.

### Scenario 4 \-\-- Latin America

#### Illicit arms destabilize Latin America\-\--the ATT is key to stop.

**[Schleicher 19]{.underline}** (Evan Schleicher, Editorial Intern for

**[Despite the overwhelming perception that the State Department system
was effective at protecting human rights]{.underline}**, it is worth
noting that the US record on arms sales has been anything but solid in
recent years. IELR Editor-in-Chief, Bruce **[Zagaris
wrote]{.underline}** in 2016 that **[a lack of effective export controls
within the US has led to [a]{.mark} significant [flow of "high-powered
weaponry from the U.S]{.mark}. to Latin America]{.underline}** and the
Caribbean **[which]{.underline}** has
**[[exacerbated]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[soaring rates of
[gun]{.mark}-related [violence]{.mark} in the region [and undermine\[d\]
U.S. influence]{.mark} in the Western Hemisphere".]{.underline}**
Between 2015 and 2017, the United States approved \$2 million to \$4
million in gun sales per year to Honduras, an amount which is
significant in a relatively poor country like Honduras.
**[Some]{.underline}** of the **[[guns sold to Honduras were turned on
protestors]{.mark} in 2017 [and]{.mark} many [others ended]{.mark} up
[in]{.mark} the hands of [criminals, with]{.mark}]{.underline}** photo
**[[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}** revealing that many of the **[[guns
used by state forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the 2017 protests [**[had
been]{.underline}** **[exported from]{.underline}**]{.mark} Colt's
Manufacturing in **[[Connecticut]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[Because the escalation of violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** and abuse
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** these **[[Latin American]{.mark} countries
has fueled the current migrant crisis]{.underline}**, **[it is
likely]{.underline}** that **[[US efforts to]{.mark}
[deregulate]{.mark}]{.underline}** its **[[international arms
trade]{.mark} and to increase arms sales will contribute to a further
[escalat]{.mark}]{.underline}**ion **[of [the migration crisis in
Central America and Mexico]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Parallel
situations]{.mark} have occurred in Libya, Afghanistan, and Syria,
[suggest]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** that further **[[deregulation of the
US arms]{.mark} trade [will]{.mark} be a source of
[increas]{.mark}]{.underline}**ing **[[instability
globally]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not just in Latin America.

So, **[why does]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[continue
to]{.underline}** operate in ways which are likely to **[undermine
its]{.underline}** long-term **[national security
objectives]{.underline}**? **[The answer is]{.underline}** alluded to in
the previous reference to Trump's NRA speech: **[domestic
politics]{.underline}**. **[It is not an accident that the President
chose]{.underline}** **[this venue to sign his executive
order]{.underline}** withdrawing the US from the ATT. In international
organizations, domestic politics remains the strongest indicators of a
states' compliance with agreements. **[The NRA and other opponents of
the ATT have historically wielded significant political power in
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
The NRA, one of the strongest lobbying groups in the US, spent over \$36
million on the Trump campaign in 2016, breaking its previous records for
campaign spending. **[There were]{.underline}** also allegations that
the group illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign to maximize the
value of expenditures on ads and to avoid repetitive efforts. President
Trump has responded to this support by heavily supporting the NRA, even
going so far as to attack the New York attorney general's office this
week for "illegally" investigating the NRA.

**[The Administration's]{.underline}** wholehearted **[acceptance of the
NRA's views]{.underline}** on this issue **[are
unfortunate]{.underline}**, **[because]{.underline}**
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rms
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty,
while imperfect, **[[provided]{.mark} [an international framework which
could help to resolve]{.mark} the]{.underline}** previously mentioned
**[[migration crises and]{.underline}]{.mark}** to **[[reduce the risks
posed to US national security by unregulated]{.mark} international [arms
sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, despite likely failure, **[active
efforts must be made to bring the US into closer compliance with the
agreed upon principles of the treaty.]{.underline}**

#### Illicit small arms trafficking is especially destabilizing to Latin America\-\--fuels organized crime

**ATT Monitor 18**, a source of information on the implementation of,
and compliance to, the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), Chapter 4,
<https://attmonitor.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/EN_ATT_2018_Chapter_4.pdf>

As previously noted, **[[there is a particular problem with
diversion]{.mark} of legally-purchased firearms to unauthorized users
across LAC. [This can involve]{.mark}]{.underline}** the diversion of
modest quantities of weapons and ammunition acquired through **['[straw
man purchases']{.mark}, instances in which an individual with a clean
background purchases firearms specifically on behalf of a person
prohibited from purchasing a firearm, [and the 'ant-trade']{.mark},
a]{.underline}** common **[form]{.underline}** of illicit trafficking
**[in which shipments of small numbers of weapons result]{.underline}**,
over time, **[in the accumulation of large amounts of SALW by
unauthorized end users.]{.underline}** The **[most commonly reported
examples of these two types of trade involve [weapons]{.mark}
that]{.underline}** are purchased by individuals in the U.S. and **[[are
trafficked in small numbers to Mexican, Central American and Brazilian
cartels and gangs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, among others. **[[Diversion
can also consist of higher order transfers of
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**, sometimes involving the use of falsified
documentation -- including end-user certificates -- produced by
intermediaries. **[These latter transactions can include the cooperation
or collusion of corrupt public officials, including in third
countries.]{.underline}**

Diverted weapons that were originally purchased lawfully in the US are a
major challenge for many countries across LAC. Between 2009 and 2014,
**[[70 percent of all illegal weapons seized in Mexico by national
authorities were determined to have originated in the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- a total of 73,684 firearms.23 Also,
between 2006 and 2009, **[34 percent of illegal guns seized in crimes in
Guatemala were traced from the U.S.]{.underline}**24 Furthermore from
2014 to 2016, some 50,133 **[guns originating in the U.S. were recovered
as part of criminal investigations in 15 countries stretching from North
America to Central America and the Caribbean]{.underline}**.25 Finally,
**[according to a 2017 report by Brazil's Federal Police, of 10,000
firearms seized since 2014, roughly 1,500 were originally manufactured
and sold in the U.S.]{.underline}**26

Table 4.2 outlines examples of different types of diversion during
transfers that occurs in LAC. These examples are listed as
country-to-country (e.g. US to Mexico) but are not intended to imply the
complicity of the governments of those countries in these diversion
cases.

As described in the previous section, a range of documentation exists,
such as EUCs and DVCs, to support efforts to limit such in-transfer
diversion, and many states in the region claim to use these tools
already. However, **[such certification on its own is likely
insufficient to prevent deliberate diversion, and [the ATT indicates
that it should be seen as part of a broader sweep of information-sharing
and confidence-building tools]{.mark} between parties to a transfer. The
ATT specifies some of the types of information that States Parties are
encouraged to share, including "corruption, international trafficking
routes, illicit brokers, sources of illicit supply, methods of
concealment, common points of dispatch, or destinations used by
organized groups engaged in diversion."]{.underline}**27 **[[Such
confidence building could also include post-delivery verification
measures]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[An example of such measures relevant
to the region is the US's 'Blue Lantern' monitoring programme, which
monitors the end-use of military as well as dual-use goods both before
and after export, and can include physical inspections on the site of
delivery]{.underline}** within 45 days. In 2014, 25 per cent of the Blue
Lantern checks carried out by the US were in the Americas.28

#### Latin American transnational organized crime fuels [terrorism]{.underline}, [destabilizes states]{.underline}, and generates uncontrollable [refugee flows]{.underline} that act as a [conflict multiplier]{.underline}

R. Evan **Ellis 16**, research professor of Latin American Studies at
the U.S. Army War College (USAWC) Strategic Studies Institute (SSI),
December 9^th^, 2016, "Strategic Insights: Thinking Strategically About
Latin America and the Caribbean",
<https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/index.cfm/articles/Thinking-Strategically-About-Latin-America-Caribbean/2016/12/09>

As noted previously, **[[there is]{.underline}]{.mark}** arguably **[[no
region]{.underline}]{.mark}** (including Asia) **[[upon which the United
States is more dependent]{.mark} for its prosperity and security, and
with which it is more closely tied through bonds of family, [than Latin
America]{.mark} and the Caribbean. [In terms of trade and investment,
from manufacturers to the food Americans put on the table, there is no
region for which disruption of commerce with the United States could do
more damage to our economy]{.mark} and the everyday lives of Americans.
Reciprocally, the region's proximity to the United States makes it a
logical and attractive business partner; there is not another region of
the world for which prosperity, healthy infrastructure, and institutions
could contribute more to a win-win commercial relationship with the
United States.]{.underline}**

With respect to security, the United States is blessed by the absence of
neighbors that pose a direct military threat to the nation, are
experiencing conditions of chaos, or permit U.S. adversaries to operate
from their territory. Yet, if these fortunate conditions were to change,
[t**he resulting threat to U.S. national security could force a
significant reorientation of U.S. security initiatives away from its
foreign engagements to address the emergent threat closer to
home.**]{.underline}

To use a military analogy, **[Latin America and the Caribbean is, for
the United States, an "unoccupied high ground."]{.underline}** The fact
that the United States does not fully leverage the opportunities offered
by Latin America, nor suffers a significant immediate security threat
from the region, does not make it any less strategic.

**[The Challenge of Transnational Organized Crime in the
Region]{.underline}**.

**[[The activities of transnational organized crime in Latin
America]{.mark} and the Caribbean, often characterized as [the principle
security issue in the region, is]{.mark} more of [a strategic
challenge]{.mark} to the United States than is commonly
understood.]{.underline}**

On the one hand, **[[the activities of]{.mark} groups such as the Maras
in the Northern Triangle and warring [cartels in Mexico generate
violence and destroy economic opportunity in ways that generate refugee
flows toward the United States]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[the
2014 crisis of child migrants from Central America obliged the Obama
administration to request an additional \$3.7 billion to respond to the
situation, eclipsing the \$979 million previously spent on the region
under the Central America Regional Security Initiative since
2008]{.underline}**.2

In addition, **[the money used to enable [transnational criminal
activities]{.mark} corrupts institutions, undermining governance, and
[expand]{.mark}ing [criminal networks that can be used by terrorist
organizations]{.mark} to raise and launder money, [smuggle]{.mark}
persons and [materiel through the region, as well as creating spaces in
which they can hide, train, plan operations, and recruit fighters for
their global activities]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Latin American instability triggers nuclear war 

**[Krepinevich and Lindsey 13]{.underline}** (Andrew and Eric, the

As the previous chapter demonstrates, for the past two hundred years
**[[the principal cause of concern for]{.mark} U.S.
defense]{.underline}** policymakers and **[planners thinking about
[Latin America has been the prospect that great powers]{.mark} outside
the Western Hemisphere [could exploit]{.mark} the military weakness and
[internal security challenges]{.mark} of the states within it to
threaten U.S. security.]{.underline}** While there is reason for
optimism about the future of Latin America,58 there is also cause for
concern. The region faces enduring obstacles to economic59 and political
development60 as well as signi􀂿cant internal security challenges. As
General John Kelly, the commander of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)61
noted in his March 2013 posture statement before Congress, Latin
America: 􀀾I􀁀s a region of enormous promise and exciting opportunities,
but it is also one of persistent challenges and complex threats. It is a
region of relative peace, low likelihood of interstate con􀃀icts, and
overall economic growth, yet is also home to corrosive criminal
violence, permissive environments for illicit activities, and episodic
political and social protests.62 [**The
[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} and non-traditional security
challenges that General Kelly cites **[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark}**
potential **[[opportunities]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the United States'
major [rivals to]{.mark}]{.underline}** (borrowing a term from Monroe's
declaration) "**[[interpose" themselves into the region]{.mark} and, by
so doing, threaten regional stability and U.S. security]{.underline}**.
Two discernible trends suggest that current and prospective **[Eurasian
rivals could seek to exploit regional conditions]{.underline}** and
dynamics **[in ways that could impose immense costs on the United States
and divert its attention from more distant theaters overseas. The first
trend is a return to a heightened level of competition among the "great
powers"]{.underline}** following two decades of U.S. dominance. The
second trend concerns the growing cost of projecting power by
traditional military means due to the proliferation of
"anti-access/area-denial" (A2/AD) capabilities in general, and
precision-guided munitions (PGMs) in particular. These trends suggest
that, despite a possible decline in relative U.S. power, external forces
will continue to 􀂿nd it beyond their means to threaten the hemisphere
through traditional forms of power projection. Far more likely is a
return of a competition similar to that which the United States engaged
in with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. During that period both
powers sought to avoid direct con􀃀ict with the other, given the risks of
escalation to nuclear con􀃀ict. Instead each focused primarily on gaining
an advantage over the other through the employment of client states and
non-state groups as proxies. Proxies were employed for reasons other
than avoiding a direct clash, such as gaining positional advantage
(e.g., enabling the sponsor to establish bases in its country, as the
Soviets did in Cuba). Proxies were also employed as a means of diverting
a rival's attention from what was considered the key region of the
competition and to impose disproportionate costs on a rival (e.g.,
Moscow's support of 􀀱orth Vietnam as a means of drawing o􀌆 U.S.
resources from Europe). This chapter outlines trends in the Western
Hemisphere security environment that outside powers may seek to exploit
to advance their objectives in ways that threaten regional stability and
U.S. security. This is followed by a discussion of how these external
powers might proceed to do so. Seeds of Instability Crime, Illicit
Networks, and Under-Governed Areas Latin America has a long history of
banditry, smuggling, and organized crime. As in the case of Pancho Villa
and the 1916-1917 Punitive Expedition, these activities have
occasionally risen to a level at which they in􀃀uence U.S. national
security calculations. Rarely, however, have these activities been as
pervasive and destabilizing as they are today. Although a wide variety
of illicit activity occurs in Latin America, criminal organizations
conducting drug tra􀌇cking are the dominant forces in the Latin American
underworld today, accounting for roughly 􀀇􀀗0 billion per year63 of an
estimated 􀀇100 billion in annual illicit trade.6􀀗 Since the Colombian
cartels were dismantled in the 1990s, this lucrative trade has been
dominated by powerful Mexican cartels whose operations extend across the
length and breadth of Mexico, as well as up the supply chain into the
cocaine-producing regions of the Andean Ridge and through their
wholesale and retail drug distribution networks across the United
States.65 The cartels, along with countless smaller criminal
organizations, comprise what the head of SOUTHCOM has described as, 􀀾a􀁀n
interconnected system of arteries that traverse the entire Western
Hemisphere, stretching across the Atlantic and Paci􀂿c, through the
Caribbean, and up and down 􀀱orth, South, and Central America . . . 􀀾a􀁀
vast system of illicit pathways 􀀾that is used􀁀 to move tons of drugs,
thousands of people, and countless weapons into and out of the United
States, Europe, and Africa with an e􀌇ciency, payload, and gross pro􀂿t
any global transportation company would envy.66 That being said, the
drug tra􀌇cking underworld is by no means a monolithic entity or
cooperative alliance. Rather, it is a fractious and brutally competitive
business in which rival entities are constantly and literally 􀂿ghting to
maximize their share of the drug trade and for control of the critical
transshipment points, or plazas, through which it 􀃀ows. To attack their
competitor's operations and protect their own operations from rivals and
the Mexican government's crackdown that began in 2006, the cartels have
built up larger, better armed, and more ruthless forces of hired gunmen
known as sicarios. Using the billions of dollars generated by their
illicit activities, they have acquired weapons and equipment formerly
reserved for state armies or state-sponsored insurgent groups, including
body armor, assault ri􀃀es, machine guns, grenades, landmines, anti-tank
rockets, mortars, car bombs, armored vehicles, helicopters, transport
planes, and---perhaps most remarkably---long-range submersibles.67 The
cartels' pro􀂿ts have also enabled them to hire former police and
military personnel, including members of several countries' elite
special operations units68 and, in several cases, active and former
members of the U.S. military.69 These personnel bring with them---and
can provide to the cartels---a level of training and tactical pro􀂿ciency
that can be equal or superior to those of the government forces they
face. As a result of this pro􀂿ciency and the military-grade weapons
possessed by the cartels, more than 2,500 Mexican police o􀌇cers and 200
military personnel were killed in confrontations with organized crime
forces between 2008 and 2012 along with tens of thousands of
civilians.70 In the poorer states of Central America, state security
forces operate at an even greater disadvantage.71 While their
paramilitary forces enable the cartels to dominate entire cities and
large remote areas through force and intimidation, they are not the only
tool available. The cartels also leverage their immense wealth to buy
the silence or support of police and government o􀌇cials who are often
presented with a choice between plata o plomo---"silver or lead."
According to the head of the Mexican Federal Police, around 2010 the
cartels were spending an estimated 􀀇100 million each month on bribes to
police.72 By buying o􀌆 o􀌇cials---and torturing or killing those who
cannot be corrupted---the cartels have greatly undermined the
e􀌆ectiveness of national government forces in general and local police
in particular. This, in turn, has undermined the con􀂿dence of the
population in their government's willingness and ability to protect
them. Through these means and methods the cartels have gained a
substantial degree of de facto control over many urban and rural areas
across Mexico, including major cities and large swathes of territory
along the U.S.-Mexico border. In many of these crime-ridden areas the
loss of con􀂿dence in the government and police has prompted the
formation of vigilante militias, presenting an additional challenge to
government control.73 Meanwhile, in the "northern triangle" of Central
America (the area comprising Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador
through which the cartels transship almost all cocaine bound for Mexico
and the United States) the situation is even more dire. Approximately 90
percent of crimes in this area go unpunished, while in Guatemala roughly
half the country's territory is e􀌆ectively under drug tra􀌇ckers'
control.7􀀗 Further south, similar pockets of lawlessness exist in
coca-growing areas in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.
In Colombia and along its borders with Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru,
much of the coca-growing territory remains under the control of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. A guerrilla
organization founded in the 1960s as a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary
movement dedicated to the overthrow of the Colombian government, the
FARC embraced coca growing in the 1990s as a means of funding its
operations and has subsequently evolved into a hybrid mix of left-wing
insurgent group and pro􀂿t-driven cartel.76 This hybrid nature has
facilitated cooperation between the FARC and ideological sympathizers
like the Bolivarian Alliance, Hezbollah, Al Qaeda in the Islamic
Maghreb, and other extremist groups77 as well as with purely criminal
organizations like the Mexican cartels. Although the FARC has been
greatly weakened over the past decade and no longer poses the
existential threat to the Colombian government that it once did, it
remains 􀂿rmly in control of large tracts of coca-producing jungle,
mostly straddling the borders between Colombia and FARC supporters
Venezuela and Ecuador. In summary, organized crime elements have
exploited under-governed areas to establish zones under their de facto
control. In so doing they pose a signi􀂿cant and growing threat to
regional security in general and U.S. interests in particular. As
SOUTHCOM commander General Kelly recently observed: 􀀾T􀁀he proximity of
the U.S. homeland to criminally governed spaces is a vulnerability with
direct implications for U.S. national security. I am also troubled by
the signi􀂿cant criminal capabilities that are available 􀀾within them􀁀 to
anyone---for a price. Transnational criminal organizations have access
to key facilitators who specialize in document forgery, trade-based
money laundering, weapons procurement, and human smuggling, including
the smuggling of special interest aliens. This criminal expertise and
the ability to move people, products, and funds are skills that can be
exploited by a variety of malign actors, including terrorists.78
Hezbollah and the Bolivarian Alliance Hezbollah in Latin America
􀀱on-state entities recognized by the U.S. as terrorist organizations
also operate in the region, most notably Lebanon-based Hezbollah, an
Iranian client group. Hezbollah maintains an active presence in the
tri-border area (TBA) of South America--- the nexus of Argentina,
Brazil, and Paraguay---stretching back to the 1980s. The TBA has
traditionally been under-governed and is known by some as "the United
􀀱ations of crime."79 Eight syndicate groups facilitate this activity in
South America's so-called "Southern Cone," overseeing legitimate
businesses along with a wide range of illegal activities to include
money laundering, drug and arms traf- 􀂿cking, identity theft and false
identi􀂿cation documents, counterfeiting currency and intellectual
property, and smuggling. 􀀱ot surprisingly they are linked to organized
crime and to non-state insurgent and terrorist groups, such as the
FARC.80 Estimates are that over 􀀇12 billion in illicit transactions are
conducted per year, a sum exceeding Paraguay's entire GDP by a
substantial amount.81 Hezbollah achieved notoriety in the region in 1992
when it bombed the Israeli embassy in Argentina. This was followed with
the bombing of the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires two
years later. Like many other terrorist organizations, as Hezbollah
expanded it established relationships with drug cartels82 that it
supports in a variety of ways. For example, the cartels have enlisted
Hezbollah, known for its tunnel construction along the Israeli border,
for help in improving their tunnels along the U.S.-Mexican border. In
2008, Hezbollah helped broker a deal in which one of Mexico's major drug
cartels, Sinaloa, sent members to Iran for weapons and explosives
training via Venezuela using Venezuelan travel documents. 83 As the
locus of the drug trade and other illegal cartel activities moved north
into Central America and Mexico, Hezbollah has sought to move with it
with mixed success. In October 2011, Hezbollah was linked to the e􀌆orts
of an Iranian-American to conspire with Iranian agents to assassinate
the Saudi ambassador to the United States. The plot involved members of
the Los Zetas Mexican drug cartel.8􀀗 The would-be assassin, Mansour
Arbabsiar, had established contact with his cousin, a Quds Force85
handler, Gen. Gholam Shakuri. The plot is believed by some to be part of
a wider campaign by the Quds Force and Hezbollah to embark on a campaign
of violence extending beyond the Middle East to other Western targets,
including those in the United States.86 In early September 2012, Mexican
authorities arrested three men suspected of operating a Hezbollah cell
in the Yucatan area and Central America, including a dual U.S.-Lebanese
citizen linked to a U.S.-based Hezbollah money laundering operation. 87A
few months later, in December 2012, Wassim el Abd Fadel, a suspected
Hezbollah member with Paraguayan citizenship, was arrested in Paraguay.
Fadel was charged with human and drug tra􀌇cking and money laundering.
Fadel reportedly deposited the proceeds of his criminal
activities---ranging from 􀀇50-200,000 per transaction---into Turkish and
Syrian bank accounts linked to Hezbollah. In summary, Hezbollah has
become a 􀂿xture in Central and Latin America, expanding both its
activities and in􀃀uence over time. It has developed links with the
increasingly powerful organized crime groups in the region, particularly
the narco cartels, along with radical insurgent groups such as the FARC
and states like Venezuela who are hostile to the United States and its
regional partners. Hezbollah's principal objectives appear to be
undermining U.S. in􀃀uence in the region, imposing costs on the United
States, and generating revenue to sustain its operations in Latin
America and elsewhere in the world. These objectives are shared by Iran,
Hezbollah's main state sponsor. The Bolivarian Alliance As noted above,
geographic, economic, and cultural factors have traditionally helped to
prevent the emergence in Latin America of any real military rival to the
United States. Although there are no traditional military threats in the
region, there are indigenous states whose actions, policies, and
rhetoric challenge regional stability and U.S. security. Over the past
decade, several states have come together to form the Bolivarian
Alliance of the Americas (ALBA), an organization of left-leaning Latin
American regimes whose overarching purpose is to promote radical
populism and socialism, foster regional integration, and reduce what
they perceive as Washington's "imperialist" influence in the region.89
Since its founding by Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro of Cuba
in December 200􀀗, the Bolivarian Alliance has expanded to include
Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Dominica, Ecuador, 􀀱icaragua, and Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines. Although the members of the Bolivarian
Alliance are militarily weak and pose almost no traditional military
threat to the United States or its allies in the region,90 they
challenge American interests in the region in other ways. First, they
espouse an anti-American narrative that finds substantial support in the
region and consistently oppose U.S. efforts to foster cooperation and
regional economic integration.91 Second, in their efforts to undermine
the government of Colombia, which they consider to be a U.S. puppet,
ALBA states provide support and sanctuaries within their borders to coca
growers, drug traffickers, other criminal organizations, and the FARC.92
Links to Hezbollah have also been detected.93 Perhaps of greatest
concern, they have aligned themselves closely with Iran, inviting it and
Syria to participate as "observer states" in the alliance. Other
worrisome ALBA activities involve lifting visa requirements for Iranian
citizens and hosting large numbers of Iranian diplomats and commercial
exchange members that some observers believe to be Iranian intelligence
and paramilitary Quds Force operatives.9􀀗 By hosting and cooperating
with both foreign agents and violent non-state actors, the ALBA states
have come to function as critical nodes in a network of groups hostile
to the United States. A Coming Era of Proxy Wars in the Western
Hemisphere? History shows that Washington has often emphasized an
indirect approach to meeting challenges to its security in Latin
America. Yet the United States has not shied away from more direct,
traditional uses of force when interests and circumstances dictated, as
demonstrated over the past half century by U.S. invasions of the
Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada (1983), and Panama (1989) and the
occupation of Haiti (199􀀗).Yet several trends seem likely to raise the
cost of such operations, perhaps to prohibitive levels. Foremost among
these trends is the diffusion of precision-guided weaponry to state and
non-state entities. 92 The Second Lebanon War as "Precursor" War A
precursor of this trend can be seen in the Second Lebanon War between
Israel and Hezbollah.95 During the con􀃀ict, which lasted less than 􀂿ve
weeks, irregular Hezbollah forces held their own against the highly
regarded Israeli Defense Force (IDF), demonstrating what is now possible
for non-state entities to accomplish given the proliferation of
militarily-relevant advanced technologies. Hezbollah's militia engaged
IDF armor columns with salvos of advanced, man-portable, antitank guided
missiles and other e􀌆ective anti-armor weapons (e.g. rocket-propelled
grenades (RPGs) with anti-armor warheads) in great numbers. When the IDF
employed its ground forces in southern Lebanon, its armored forces
su􀌆ered severe losses; out of the four hundred tanks involved in the
􀂿ghting in southern Lebanon, forty-eight were hit and forty damaged.96
Hezbollah's defensive line was also well equipped with latest-generation
thermal and low-/ no-light enhanced illumination imaging systems, while
frontline units were connected to each other and higher command elements
via a proprietary, 􀂿ber-optic based communications network, making
collection of communications tra􀌇c by Israeli intelligence extremely
di􀌇cult. Perhaps most important, Hezbollah possessed thousands of short-
and medium- range rockets, often skillfully hidden below ground or in
bunkers that made detection from overhead surveillance platforms nearly
impossible. During the brief con􀃀ict Hezbollah's forces 􀂿red some four
thousand unguided rockets of various types that hit Israel. Hezbollah's
rocket inventory enabled its forces to attack targets throughout the
northern half of Israel. Over nine hundred rockets hit near or on
buildings, civilian infrastructure, and industrial plants. Some two
thousand homes were destroyed, and over 􀂿fty Israelis died with several
thousand more injured. The casualties would undoubtedly been greater if
between 100,000 and 250,000 Israeli civilians had not 􀃀ed their homes.
Haifa, Israel's major seaport had to be shut down, as did its oil
re􀂿nery.97 Hezbollah also employed several unmanned aerial vehicles for
surveillance of Israel, as well as C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles used
to attack and damage an Israeli corvette. 98 The G-RAMM Battlefield The
brief war between Israel and Hezbollah suggests that future irregular
forces may be well-equipped with enhanced communications, extended-range
surveillance capabilities, and precision-guided rockets, artillery,
mortars and missiles (G-RAMM) 99 able to hit targets with high accuracy
at ranges measured from the tens of kilometers perhaps up to a hundred
kilometers or more. In projecting power against enemies equipped in this
manner and employing these kinds of tactics U.S. forces---as well as
other conventional forces--- will find themselves operating in a far
more lethal battlefield than those in either of the Gulf wars or in
stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Moreover, currently
constituted conventional forces typically depend on large fixed
infrastructure (e.g., military bases, logistics depots, ports,
airfields, railheads, bridges) to deploy themselves and sustain combat
operations. These transportation and support hubs also serve as the
nodes through which internal commerce and foreign trade moves within a
country. This key, fixed infrastructure will almost certainly prove far
more difficult to defend against irregular forces armed with G-RAMM
weaponry. Indeed, had Hezbollah's "RAMM" inventory had only a small
fraction of G-RAMM munitions, say 10-20 percent, it would have been able
to in􀃀ict far greater damage than it did historically to Israeli
population centers, key government facilities, military installations,
and essential commercial assets such as ports, air􀂿elds, and industrial
complexes. An irregular enemy force armed with G-RAMM capabilities in
substantial numbers could seriously threaten Latin American governments
as well as any U.S. (or external great power) forces and support
elements attempting a traditional intervention operation. Implications
for the U.S. and Other Major Powers The preceding narrative suggests
that the combat potential of irregular forces is likely to increase
dramatically in the coming years. As this occurs, the cost of operating
conventional forces---especially ground forces---and defending key
military support infrastructure is likely to rise substantially. Given
these considerations the United States and other major powers external
to the Western Hemisphere will have strong incentives to avoid the use
of conventional forms of military power, particularly large ground
forces, in favor of employing irregular proxy forces to advance their
interests. Moreover, the high cost and questionable bene􀂿t of the
campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq are likely to create strong domestic
opposition in the United States to such operations for some time to
come. This must be added to the United States' greatly diminished 􀂿scal
standing that has led to large cuts in planned investments in defense.
These factors suggest that Washington will be much less likely to engage
in direct military action in Latin America in the coming years than
historically has been the case. At the same time, rivals of the United
States like China and Russia may be incentivized by these trends, as
well as the United States' overwhelming military dominance in the
Western Hemisphere, to avoid the direct use of force to expand their
in􀃀uence in Latin America. Instead, like some of the Bolivarian Alliance
members, they appear likely to follow the path taken by the Soviet Union
during the Cold War and Iran today: supporting non-state proxies to
impose disproportionate costs on the United States and to distract
Washington's resources and attention from other parts of the world.
**[This is not to say that Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran would eschew
future opportunities to establish bases in Latin America]{.underline}**.
As in the past, such bases can support efforts to accomplish several
important objectives. They can, for example, further insulate a Latin
American regime from the threat of direct U.S. military intervention,
since **[Washington would have to account for the possibility that [the
conflict would lead to a direct confrontation with a]{.mark} more
capable and potentially [nuclear-armed power.]{.mark}]{.underline}**100
**[[Bases]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the hemisphere
**[[can]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[enable]{.mark} external powers
to conduct [military assistance activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such
as training[,]{.mark} more easily. **[[Electronic
surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the United States and Latin
American states **[[could be accomplished more cheaply and
effectively]{.mark} from forward positions. Finally, certain kinds of
military capabilities, such as long-range ballistic [missiles]{.mark}
and attack submarines, [could be]{.mark}]{.underline}** pro􀂿tably
**[[stationed]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Latin America by powers external
to that region, particularly if they intended to create the option of
initiating con􀃀ict at some future date. These reasons, among others,
have made preventing an extra-hemispheric power from establishing bases
in Latin America an enduring U.S. priority. Players in a Latin American
Great Game **[[Given current trends]{.mark}, several [powers external to
the region may]{.mark}, either now or over the coming decade, [have both
the motive and the means to employ both state and non-state
proxies]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Latin American to achieve their
interests. Principal among them is Iran, which is already engaged in
supporting proxies against the United States and its partners in the
Middle East and has long been developing proxies in Latin America.
Additionally, **[there are reasons to think that China and Russia may be
interested in cultivating and supporting Latin American proxies as
well]{.underline}**

Drug networks are not the only organizations capitalizing on the
availability of small arms. Where small arms contribute to illegal drug
trades in Latin American countries, **[in African countries [small arms
are used for illegal poaching]{.mark}, ivory trading, as well as diamond
and gem trading. [Poachers pay arms dealers]{.mark} in Zimbabwe [with
ivory]{.mark} and precious gems in exchange for weapons, and poaching

criminals and associated organizations for large profits]{.underline}**
(Ipinge 1999). **[In Swaziland, weapons are smuggled into central depots

Namibian deserts and the rainforests of Rwanda and Borneo. But their
range has shrunk and they are now extinct in the Middle East, on the
Indonesian island of Java, northern Africa and most of China. Almost
everywhere, these great nomads are restricted to ever-decreasing pockets
of land.]{.underline}**

How many elephants are alive around the world?

In 1800 there may have been 26 million elephants in Africa alone,
although it's hard to be precise. But today, after years of poaching and
habitat destruction, those numbers are a tiny fraction of what they once
were.

**[In Asia, [it is
estimated](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0) that less than
50,000 elephants remain]{.underline}**; more than half of them in India.
**[Tiny populations, a few hundreds or thousands, cling on in countries
across south-east Asia and the Himalayas.]{.underline}**

**[[In Africa]{.mark}, the larger of [the]{.mark} two [species is a step
further from extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Less than **[[[half a
million roam the
continent](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/24/african-elephants-could-be-extinct-in-wild-within-decades-say-experts),
mostly in the southern states]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the west and
the forested centre, **[elephants are in a particularly perilous
condition]{.underline}**.

What has caused the destruction of elephants?

For thousands of years **[ivory has been prized and elephants have been
killed for it.]{.underline}** The Egyptian pharoah Tutankhamun was laid
to rest around 1323BC on a headrest of ivory, while in nearby Syria
elephants were more or less wiped out for their ivory by 500BC.

**[The invention of [guns increased the pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The 19th century brought a fashion for big game hunting among
colonialists, which wiped out herds across the continent of Africa. Now
**[the remaining [dwindling numbers face the threat of]{.mark} local
hunters and modern [poaching gangs]{.mark}, financed by Asian syndicates
and armed by the conflicts of Africa.]{.underline}**

Some experts see the brutal killings of elephants not as a battle for a
commodity, but for land. As the human population booms, so does demand
for space. Poaching conveniently removes elephants from the land,
leaving it open to development. This is a pattern seen across western
Africa, where elephant declines have been most precipitous. By 2050, 63%
of remaining elephant rangelands [will be
compromised](https://www.cites.org/sites/default/files/common/resources/pub/Elephants_in_the_dust.pdf) (pdf)
by human encroachment.

The tightly-contested rural landscapes of Asia have seen a more direct
form of conflict between humans and elephants. In an evening's feeding a
herd of elephants can destroy the annual crop of many small farmers.
Human lives are also in danger. In India, panicked or enraged elephants
kill [more than 400 people each
year](http://www.moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/ETF_REPORT_FINAL.pdf) (pdf).
This leads to retaliation. Wildlife authorities often hunt down and kill
problem elephants. In Indonesia, [dozens of elephants are
poisoned](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/elephants/human_elephant_conflict.cfm) by
palm oil growers each year.

Uncovering the 'elephant holocaust'

As Africa's nations shook off colonial rule in the years following World
War II, a huge poaching crisis arose. British zoologist Ian Douglas
Hamilton, who flew a light aircraft over sub-Saharan African countries
to count elephants in the 1970s and 80s, uncovered what became known as
the "elephant holocaust". He estimated **[that African elephant numbers
fell from one million to 400,000 during the 1980s.]{.underline}**

Without the often dangerous work of Hamilton, governments would not have
come together to [ban the international trade in ivory in
1989](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/17/science/ivory-trade-is-banned-to-save-the-elephant.html).
This led to a recovery in elephant numbers until 2008, when infiltration
of the ivory trade by criminal gangs, rising Asian demand and high
levels of corruption increased the levels of poaching with catastrophic
results.

How many elephants are killed a year for ivory?

**[Around [20,000 African elephants were killed last year for their
tusks, [more than were
born](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/03/african-elephants-killed-faster-than-they-are-being-born)]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Chinese wealth is financing a hunger for ivory that threatens to bring
an end to wild elephants within our lifetime.

**[[There has never been a more dangerous time to be an
elephant]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Not during the industrial pillaging
of the colonial era, nor the chaotic African and Asian independence
movements that sparked a 1970s poaching boom, has an elephant been more
likely to fall to a gun.]{.underline}**

#### [Extinction]{.underline} -- elephants are a [keystone]{.underline} species\-\--and, [poaching funds terrorism]{.underline}

Kate **Good 14**, Writer @ One Green Planet citing Dirzo, Department of
Biology @ Stanford, "When the Elephants Go, Will We be the Next to
Follow?," <http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/sixth-extinction-when-elephants-go-will-we-follow/>

A new report from the journal, Science, confirms that [the sixth mass
extinction of species is ]{.underline}well [underway]{.underline}. There
is no arguing with the facts on this one; in the past 200,000 years
humans have spent on the planet, nearly 1,000 species have gone extinct.
Since the year 1500, we have killed off 322 animal species, and the
remaining animal species on Earth have shown an average of a 25 percent
decline in abundance. Additionally, in just the past 35 years, the human
population nearly doubled while the number of small insects and
invertebrates fell by half. Could these trends be related? [The loss of
species is moving at such a rapid pace that it has been termed
"**defaunation**"]{.underline} connoting a process similar to
deforestation. Incredibly aggressive, and distinctly human. Current
extinction rates are occurring nearly 1,000 times faster than the
average pace in Earth's history. While [this rapid disappearance of
species ]{.underline}may seem like a far off problem to a person who
lives in a city or far separated from any sort of wildlife[, the
trickle down effect ]{.underline}of the disappearance of these
species [will]{.underline}likely [**come full-circle**, **impacting
human life** ]{.underline}as well. **When the [Elephants
Go... ]{.underline}**[The African elephant has been poached into **near
oblivion** ]{.underline}in recent years due to the prevalence of the
illegal ivory trade. Every year between 35,000 and 50,000 African
elephants are slaughtered for their ivory tusks, which have a market
value that is notably higher than gold. [By examining
the ]{.underline}greater [impact that the disappearance of one
this **single animal,** the African elephant, has **already
had** ]{.underline}on the social and environmental health of its native
regions, [we can begin to understand the breadth of the impact we are
set to see with the further collapse of the world's
species]{.underline}. Rising Social Unrest The illegal wildlife trade
ranks among the top grossing illicit trades on Earth, and [just as [drug
cartels use profits]{.mark} from sales [to purchase ammunition]{.mark}
and fund criminal activity, [the leaders of illegal wildlife
trades]{.mark} use their profits to similar ends. Boko Haram, al-Shebab,
and the Lord's Resistance Army, are all known to **[use wildlife
poaching to fund terrorist attacks]{.mark}**. The result are not only
wreaking havoc on wildlife populations, but also driving violent, social
unrest. However, the criminal activity that spawns from poaching the
African elephant is not the only negative impact that the disappearance
of this species has on humans.]{.underline} Public Health
Concerns **[Elephants are largely considered the architect of the
African ecosystem]{.underline}**. In "The Human Ecology of World Systems
in East Africa: The Impact of the Ivory Trade," N. Thomas Hakansson
asserts that [aside from the human, no other mammal has such a profound
effect on their environment than the elephant]{.underline} as [flora and
fauna trends alter **greatly depending on their presence. **Elephants
dig deep wells in dry riverbeds to form watering holes for other
animals, without the elephant, **droughts cause mass deaths** for other
animals and disease from rodents and insects runs
rampant]{.underline}. Further, [this species is responsible for
maintaining **open grasslands** in the
African **savannah**]{.underline}. Areas where the elephant have been
removed exhibit thick wooded vegetation. [This sort of vegetation is an
ideal habitat for the tsetse flies, which, like the mosquito, spread
blood-born pathogens amongst humans.]{.underline} Ecosystem Collapse [If
vegetation is not properly controlled it causes soil erosion, allowing
rivers and other much needed water resources to dry out putting even
more strain on a struggling water cycle.]{.underline} To paraphrase the
FAO, [**soil erosion has the ability to destroy entire
civilizations**. The IPCC estimates that one billion people already
living in dry conditions will face increasing water scarcity as the
environment **continues to degrade.** ]{.underline}Clean, potable water
is already hard to come by in many regions of the African dessert. If by
protecting the elephant we could help to restore dying ecosystems,
prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and prevent social unrest and
criminal activity, then would a tusk be worth more than just its dollar
amount? Could the Prevention of the Sixth Mass Extinction be in Our
Control? It is a series of human actions that has driven us to this
crossroad: on one side there is a categorical cliff, but on the other
there is a slow road to recovery. Luckily, of all human strengths
innovation has never been an area of difficulty. Knowing what we do
about the cause of species extinction there are very effective actions
we can take to change the course of our human "meteor." This is not a
situation that we can look back on and say, "well, if we had known what
was going on, we would have done something." It's a time for action. If
we can manage to counteract the effects of "defaunation" with
"refaunation," we can save these three species from extinction and
slowly work our way toward helping others. [The sixth extinction is
underway, but the difference between now and when it began is that now
people are waking up.]{.underline} By making the connection and seeing
that this disappearing species will inevitably one day be us, we can
change the course of this barreling storm. [If we were powerful enough
to start this ripple, **we are certainly strong enough to stop
it.**]{.underline}

#### Terrorism causes [extinction]{.underline}

And **[what standards of international order and law would still
hold]{.underline}** sway? **[[The country attacked might]{.mark} well
[lash out militarily]{.mark}]{.underline}** at whatever countries it
thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A terrifying
description of the kinds of discussions that might occur appeared in
Brian Jenkins' book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) **[[With the nuclear
threshold]{.mark} already [crossed]{.mark}]{.underline}** in this
scenario---at least by terrorists---[[it is **conceivable**]{.mark}
**that [some of]{.mark} the resulting [conflicts might escalate to
nuclear use]{.mark}.**]{.underline} **[[International politics could
become]{.mark}]{.underline}** more **[brutish]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** [**[violent,]{.underline}** **[with powerful
states taking unilateral action]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[by
force]{.underline}** if necessary, in an effort to ensure their
security. [**[After 9/11, the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[led]{.mark} the [invasions of two]{.mark} sovereign
[nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in wars that have since cost hundreds
of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, while plunging a region
into chaos. **[Would the reaction after a far more devastating nuclear
attack be any less?]{.underline}**

In particular, the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
**[Powerful states would likely demand]{.underline}** that **[others
surrender their nuclear material or accept foreign troops]{.underline}**
(or other imposed security measures) to guard it.

**[That could well be the first step toward a more profound
transformation of the international system]{.underline}**. After such a
catastrophe, **[[major powers may feel compelled to]{.mark} more freely
[engage in preventive war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, seizing territories
they worry might otherwise be terrorist safe havens, and taking other
steps they see as brutal but necessary to preserve their security. For
this reason, **[foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has
argued]{.underline}** that **["conventional [rules]{.mark} of
sovereignty [would be abandoned overnight]{.mark}."]{.underline}**
**[[Confidence in]{.underline}]{.mark}** both the national security
institutions of the country attacked and **[[international
institutions]{.mark} such as]{.underline}** the **[International Atomic
Energy Agency and the U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations,
which had so manifestly failed to prevent the devastation, **[[might
erode]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The effect on nuclear weapons policies is
hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror driving a new push
for nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine states feeling more
certain than ever before that they needed nuclear weapons.

#### [Elephants]{.underline} key to [carbon sequestration]{.underline} in the [Congo Basin]{.underline} -- they clear forests and spread seeds in ways [no other creature can ]{.underline}

Daniel **Stiles 11**, International Union for Conservation of Nature,
"Elephant Meat Trade in Central Africa," Occasional Paper of the IUCN
Species Survival Commission No.

The Central Africa subregion is of particular importance to elephant
conservation because one of the two main variants of the African
elephant is confined to the Congo Basin, which makes up a large part of
Central Africa. Recent work with DNA has proposed that the forest
elephant is a species distinct from the savannah elephant, and that they
diverged between 2.4 and 5.8 million years ago (Murata, et al., 2009;
Rohland, et al., 2010; Ishida, et al., 2011). [This research supports
earlier investigations that ]{.underline}also [concluded that African
elephants were comprised of two separate species ]{.underline}(Grubb, et
al., 2000; Roca, et al., 2001), though taxonomic separation at the
species level has been contested (e.g. Debruyne, 2005). West Africa
hosts a type of elephant whose taxonomic status is still undecided,
though Ishida, et al.'s (2011) work grouped the southern West African
populations with forest elephants and the northern West African
elephants with savannah elephants. Until further genomic studies confirm
the taxonomic relationships between elephant variants, the forest
elephant will be considered a subspecies of the African elephant and
will be referred to as Loxondonta africana cyclotis. [Forest elephants
are **particularly vulnerable to extinction** by over-hunting due to
their **slow reproduction **and **behavioural
traits**]{.underline} (e.g. [repeated use of forest
trails and congregation in clearings]{.underline}) (Blake, et al., 2007;
Fa & Brown, 2009). [The loss of the forest elephant to poaching would
have a **significant impact** **on the Congo Basin forest
ecology**. Recent research has demonstrated the crucial importance of
elephants as seed dispersers and in maintaining the community structure
of trees]{.underline} (Blake, et al., 2009; Vanthomme, et al.,
2010). [**Elephants are a keystone species** upon which many **other
species depend**]{.underline}. As well as dispersing [seeds, they
create **clearings in thick forests**, which allows many other plant and
animal **species to thrive**]{.underline}. The [disappearance of the
forest elephant would have **devastating consequences** on many other
species and **impact negatively on Congo Basin forests.**]{.underline}

#### [Congo Basin]{.underline} is key to [global biodiversity]{.underline}\-\--lungs of the Earth\-\--[its destruction independently]{.underline} causes extinction\-\--and exacerbates [climate change]{.underline} by pushing Earth past the [carbon tipping point]{.underline}

Serge **Mombouli 14**, Congolese Ambassador to the US, Embassy of the
Republic of Congo,
http://www.ambacongo-us.org/en-us/aboutcongo/congobasin.aspx

The [Congo Basin is the world's **second largest rain
forest** ]{.underline}after the Amazon and is an area of 228,000,000
hectares, comprising the Republic of Congo, Cameroon, the Central
African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, the Democratic Republic of Congo
and Gabon. [As the second **largest lung of the world,** the Congo
Basinshelters ]{.underline}approximately [**26% of the planet's rain
forests** and **a wealth of biodiversity.** It contains over **10,000
plant species**, **1000 bird species** and **400 mammal
species.**]{.underline}

**[The Congo Basin forests are crucial to the survival of
humanity]{.underline}**. In fact, [they generate oxygen
which ]{.underline}contributes to the quality of the air we
breathe. They also [play an important role in **climate
stability. **]{.underline}Indeed, they absorb rainfall and release it
slowly into the atmosphere throughout evaporation during sunshine,
creating air masses and clouds, which in turn lead to rainfall. They
help regulate local and regional rainfall. **Most of the rainfall
sprinkling Africa comes from the Congo Basin.**

Moreover, [**the Basin forests help slow global warming by storing and
sequestering carbon.** ]{.underline}While the Basin forests are useful
in maintaining climate stability, they also serve as **crucial sources
of food,** **medicine**, **clean drinking water** and recreational
activities.

Unfortunately, according to some sources, two million acres of the Congo
Basin forests disappear every year due to logging, mining, agriculture
and firewood for a growing population. **This rate of forest loss is
threatening. **The United Nations estimate that the disappearance of
forests negatively impacts the lifestyle of people and threatens the
wildlife established in this area. [The removal of forests in the
Basin causes greenhouse gas emissions, thus **igniting the
repercussions** on global climate change.]{.underline} It is believed by
scientists that two thirds of the Congo Basin forests could be lost by
2040, unless adequate efforts to protect them are firmly implemented.

#### Passing the [carbon tipping point]{.underline} is [irreversible]{.underline} and causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--we're at the [brink]{.underline} now

**MIT 7/8**, private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
July 8^th^, 2019, "Breaching a \'carbon threshold\' could lead to mass
extinction",
<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190708154057.htm>

Daniel Rothman, professor of geophysics and co-director of the Lorenz
Center in MIT\'s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary
Sciences, has found that **[[when the rate at which carbon dioxide
enters the oceans pushes past a]{.mark} certain
[threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}** \-- whether as the result of a sudden
burst or a slow, steady influx **[\-- [the Earth may respond with a
runaway cascade of chemical feedbacks]{.mark}, leading to extreme ocean
acidification that dramatically amplifies the effects of the original
trigger.]{.underline}**

**[This global reflex causes huge changes in the amount of carbon
contained in the Earth\'s oceans]{.underline}**, and geologists can see
evidence of these changes in layers of sediments preserved over hundreds
of millions of years.

Rothman looked through these geologic records and observed that over the
last 540 million years, the ocean\'s store of carbon changed abruptly,
then recovered, dozens of times in a fashion similar to the abrupt
nature of a neuron spike. This \"excitation\" of the carbon cycle
occurred most dramatically near the time of four of the five great mass
extinctions in Earth\'s history.

Scientists have attributed various triggers to these events, and they
have assumed that the changes in ocean carbon that followed were
proportional to the initial trigger \-- for instance, the smaller the
trigger, the smaller the environmental fallout.

But Rothman says that\'s not the case. It didn\'t matter what initially
caused the events; **[for]{.underline}** roughly half **[the disruptions
in his database, once they were set in motion, the rate at which carbon
increased was essentially the same.]{.underline}** Their characteristic
rate is likely a property of the carbon cycle itself \-- not the
triggers, because different triggers would operate at different rates.

What does this all have to do with our modern-day climate? **[Today\'s
oceans are absorbing carbon about an order of magnitude faster than the
worst case in the geologic record \-- the end-Permian
extinction.]{.underline}** But humans have only been pumping carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere for hundreds of years, versus the tens of
thousands of years or more that it took for volcanic eruptions or other
disturbances to trigger the great environmental disruptions of the past.
Might the modern increase of carbon be too brief to excite a major
disruption?

According to Rothman, **[[today we are \"at the precipice of
excitation]{.mark},\" and if it occurs, the resulting
spike]{.underline}** \-- as evidenced through ocean acidification,
species die-offs, and more \-- **[is likely to be similar to past global
catastrophes.]{.underline}**

\"**[[Once we\'re over the threshold, how we got there may not
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" says Rothman, who is publishing his
results this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences. \"**[Once you get over it, you\'re dealing with how the Earth
works, and it goes on its own ride]{.underline}**.\"

A carbon feedback

In 2017, Rothman made a dire prediction: **[By the end of this century,
the planet is likely to reach a critical threshold, based on the rapid
rate at which humans are adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. When
we cross that threshold, we are likely to set in motion a freight train
of consequences, potentially culminating in the Earth\'s sixth mass
extinction.]{.underline}**

Rothman has since sought to better understand this prediction, and more
generally, the way in which the carbon cycle responds once it\'s pushed
past a critical threshold. In the new paper, he has developed a simple
mathematical model to represent the carbon cycle in the Earth\'s upper
ocean and how it might behave when this threshold is crossed.

Scientists know that **[when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
dissolves in seawater, it not only makes the oceans more acidic, but it
also decreases the concentration of carbonate ions. When the carbonate
ion concentration falls below a threshold, shells made of calcium
carbonate dissolve. Organisms that make them fare poorly in such harsh
conditions.]{.underline}**

**[Shells, in addition to protecting marine life, provide a \"ballast
effect,\" weighing organisms down and enabling them to sink to the ocean
floor along with detrital organic carbon, effectively removing carbon
dioxide from the upper ocean. But [in a world of increasing carbon
dioxide, fewer calcifying organisms should mean less carbon dioxide is
removed.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[\"**[It\'s a positive feedback]{.underline}**]{.mark},\" Rothman says.
\"**[More carbon dioxide leads to more carbon dioxide]{.underline}**.
The question from a mathematical point of view is, is such a feedback
enough to render the system unstable?\"

\"An inexorable rise\"

Rothman captured this positive feedback in his new model, which
comprises two differential equations that describe interactions between
the various chemical constituents in the upper ocean. He then observed
how the model responded as he pumped additional carbon dioxide into the
system, at different rates and amounts.

He found that no matter the rate at which he added carbon dioxide to an
already stable system, the carbon cycle in the upper ocean remained
stable. In response to modest perturbations, the carbon cycle would go
temporarily out of whack and experience a brief period of mild ocean
acidification, but it would always return to its original state rather
than oscillating into a new equilibrium.

**[When he introduced carbon dioxide at greater rates, he found that
once the levels crossed a critical threshold, the carbon cycle reacted
with a cascade of positive feedbacks that magnified the original
trigger, causing the entire system to spike, in the form of severe ocean
acidification.]{.underline}** The system did, eventually, return to
equilibrium, after tens of thousands of years in today\'s oceans \-- an
indication that, despite a violent reaction, the carbon cycle will
resume its steady state.

This pattern matches the geological record, Rothman found. The
characteristic rate exhibited by half his database results from
excitations above, but near, the threshold. Environmental disruptions
associated with mass extinction are outliers \-- they represent
excitations well beyond the threshold. At least three of those cases may
be related to sustained massive volcanism.

\"**[When you go past a threshold, you get a free kick from the system
responding by itself]{.underline}**,\" Rothman explains. \"**[The system
is on an inexorable rise. This is what excitability is, and how a neuron
works too.]{.underline}**\"

**[Although carbon is entering the oceans today at an unprecedented
rate, it is doing so over a geologically brief time.]{.underline}**
Rothman\'s model predicts that the two effects cancel: Faster rates
bring us closer to the threshold, but shorter durations move us away.
Insofar as the threshold is concerned, the modern world is in roughly
the same place it was during longer periods of massive volcanism.

In other words, **[[if]{.mark} today\'s human-induced [emissions cross
the threshold]{.mark} and continue beyond it]{.underline}**, as Rothman
predicts they soon will, **[[the consequences may be]{.mark} just as
severe as what the Earth experienced during its previous [mass
extinctions]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Unchecked climate change causes extinction and turns every scenario for [nuclear war]{.underline}\-\--also causes [nuclear terrorism]{.underline}

**[Climate change and nuclear weapons represent two key threats of our
time. [Climate change endangers ecosystems]{.mark} and social systems
all over the world. The degradation of natural resources, the [decline
of water and food]{.mark} supplies, [forced migration]{.mark}, [and more
frequent and intense disasters will greatly affect population
clusters]{.mark}, big and small. [Climate-related shocks will]{.mark}
add stress to the world's existing conflicts and [act as a "threat
multiplier"]{.mark} in already fragile regions.]{.underline}** This
could contribute to a decline of international stability and trigger
hostility between people and nations. Meanwhile, the 15,500 **[[nuclear
weapons]{.mark} that remain in the arsenals of only a few states
[possess the]{.mark} destructive [force to destroy life on Earth]{.mark}
as we know multiple times over]{.underline}**. With nuclear deterrence
strategies still in place, and hundreds of weapons on 'hair trigger
alert', the risks of nuclear war caused by accident, miscalculation or
intent remain plentiful and imminent. Despite growing recognition that
climate change and nuclear weapons pose critical security risks, the
linkages between both threats are largely ignored. However, nuclear and
climate risks interfere with each other in a mutually enforcing way.
**[[Conflicts induced by climate change could]{.mark} contribute to
global insecurity, which, in turn, could [enhance the chance of a
nuclear weapon being used]{.mark}, [could create]{.mark} more [fertile
breeding grounds for]{.mark} terrorism, including [nuclear terrorism,
and could feed]{.mark} the [ambitions]{.mark} among some states [to
acquire nuclear arms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Furthermore, as evidenced
by a series of incidents in recent years, extreme weather events,
environmental degradation and major seismic events can directly impact
the safety and security of nuclear installations. Moreover, a nuclear
war could lead to a rapid and prolonged drop in average global
temperatures and significantly disrupt the global climate for years to
come, which would have disastrous implications for agriculture,
threatening the food supply for most of the world. Finally, climate
change, nuclear weapons and nuclear energy pose threats of
intergenerational harm, as evidenced by the transgenerational effects of
nuclear testing and nuclear power accidents and the lasting impacts on
the climate, environment and public health by carbon emissions. 4
Nuclear energy is a critical issue in both climate change and nuclear
weapons debates. Although sometimes offered as a solution to climate
change, nuclear energy is neither required for nor capable of solving
the climate crisis. Nuclear energy lacks the capacity potential to
significantly replace the huge amounts of fossil energy, is not
economically viable, and is not flexible to meet demand fluctuations by
consumers. Furthermore, it stands in the way of increased renewable
energy and enhanced energy efficiency. In addition, the nuclear 'fuel
chain' contains a variety of problems and risks, including the release
of radioactive materials at every stage of the cycle and long-term
safety problems of nuclear waste disposal. Another serious problem is
the possibility at various stages of the nuclear fuel chain to divert
nuclear technologies and know-how toward nuclear weapons development.
The recognition of the right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) further compounds this
problem as it encourages states to develop nuclear industries, which can
lead to high stakes confrontations and may trigger armed conflict. The
discrepancy between long-term goals and concrete steps undermines the
conditions for international cooperation in security and climate policy.
Despite growing awareness of the urgency of tackling the climate and
nuclear threat among policy-makers, academics and civil society,
concrete action is lagging behind. Furthermore, there exist
international legal obligations both with regard to curbing climate
change and achieving universal nuclear disarmament. On both fronts,
litigation has been used to ensure these obligations are implemented.
Scientists and engineers invented the technologies to exploit fossil
energy and nuclear power (both for civilian and military purposes) and
so they have a special responsibility in abolishing both. Because of
their expertise, they can make major contributions to abolishing nuclear
arsenals and developing the technologies necessary for a sustainable
energy transition. **[[Preventing]{.mark} the dangers of [climate change
and nuclear war requires an integrated set of
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}** that address the causes as well as the
impacts on the natural and social environment. Institutions are needed
to strengthen common, ecological and human security, build and reinforce
conflict-resolution mechanisms, low-carbon energy alternatives and
sustainable lifecycles that respect the capabilities of the living world
and create the conditions for viable and sustainable peace.

### Gendered Violence -- 1AC

#### Trump's withdrawal from the ATT exacerbates the illicit trade of arms

Paul D. **[Shinkman 19]{.underline}**, senior national security reporter
for U.S. News & World Report, "Trump to Withdraw U.S. From Key
International Weapons Pact," 4/26/19,
https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-04-26/trump-to-withdraw-us-from-key-international-weapons-pact

Advocates of the treaty say [[Trump\'s decision does **irreversible
damage** to governing the]{.mark} sale and [spread of weapons]{.mark}
internationally.]{.underline}

\"[[This sends a message that the U.S. is not committed to the]{.mark}
global [norm of]{.mark} restraint and [responsibility]{.mark} in the
global arms trade. I think **[that\'s a powerful
message,]{.mark}**\"]{.underline} says Rachel Stohl, managing director
of the Stimson Center\'s Conventional Defense Program who served as a
consultant to the U.N. in drafting the treaty.

[The agreement centers on standardizing the way countries document the
cross-border gun trade between governments, including requiring that its
members produce annual reports on imports and exports to provide a
better international understanding of what weapons are going
where]{.underline}. It requires participating countries to assess the
potential for violations to human rights or international humanitarian
law before authorizing an arms sale.

[[The system **helps identify destabilizing**]{.mark}, dangerous or
otherwise troublesome [**transfers** and allows other countries to
question]{.mark} those sales [and learn from one another how to control
them, supporters say.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"[There has never been a treaty that addresses the global trade in
conventional arms, and [this is every kind of system from small arms and
light weapons all the way up to fighter jets, warships and
tanks]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Stohl says. \"[[It provides a
great]{.mark}er **[opportunity for developing]{.mark} global
[norms]{.mark}** []{.mark}and for establishing criteria [that aim to
prevent deadly weapons from getting in the hands of unscrupulous
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}[.\"]{.mark}

One hundred and thirty countries have signed the treaty, with 101
formally joining it and 96 ratifying it. Four annual meetings have taken
place since 2015.

Russia and China are not signatories of the treaty, though China is an
observer to the treaty\'s annual meetings.

International interest in the treaty began during the final months of
the presidency of George W. Bush, but the drafting and ratification
process took place during the Obama administration.

America\'s involvement in the treaty is unusual in that it was
principally influential in drafting the language to accommodate U.S.
laws and policies but is not an official party to it -- the U.S. signed
the treaty in 2013 prior to it coming into force in December 2014 but
had not ratified it, which would require congressional approval.

It\'s unclear precisely what steps the U.S. must take to withdraw itself
from the treaty.

Though the treaty itself does not govern the transfer of firearms
domestically or its use among member countries\' citizens, the NRA has
long criticized it, particularly that it does not contain a mechanism
for enforcement, and called for the U.S. to withdraw.

\"Every American should be concerned with not only their delegation\'s
open support of the ATT, but their promise that they are working towards
ratifying it at the first available opportunity,\" the NRA\'s lobbying
arm, the Institute for Legal Action, wrote in 2016, calling the
agreement \"a treaty aimed at attacking the Second Amendment.\"

However, the treaty\'s advocates say [[it serves as the **only tool** to
standardize and provide transparency for how countries buy and sell
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"[This announcement is a misguided blow to efforts to promote
international peace and security]{.underline},\" Adotei Akwei, deputy
director for advocacy and government relations at Amnesty International,
said in an emailed statement. \"[With this announcement [the Trump
admin]{.mark}istration [will re-open the floodgates for arms
sales]{.mark} with weakened human rights criteria, [which could]{.mark}
potentially [fuel brutal conflicts, and make everyone less
safe]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

Stohl says Trump\'s decision \"undermines that spirit of cooperation and
accountability that we should have as we -- not just the U.S., but as
countries -- make decisions to transfer lethal arms around the world.\"

The treaty\'s drafters went out of their way to craft language that
applies solely to the United States to avoid the perception that it
would limit domestic uses, like sport shooting or hunting, Stohl says.
It does not require domestic documentation about activities related to
firearms or call for a gun registry of individuals.

[**[Some of America\'s closest allies are reportedly planning to object
to Trump\'s decision]{.mark}**, and his announcement comes ahead of a
meeting with one of the world\'s most vocal advocates for the
treaty]{.underline}. Trump is scheduled to meet later Friday with
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose government has been lobbying
for more countries to join it.

Japan was the first in Asia and the most recent to preside over the
annual forum for signatories, known as the Conference of State Parties
to Arms Trade Treaty. In remarks last August, Japan\'s minister of
foreign affairs called the treaty \"undoubtedly a landmark
achievement.\"

It\'s unclear whether Abe will raise concerns about the treaty
withdrawal with Trump.

#### The Illicit Arms Trade causes gender-based violence\-\--Small Arms are used to exploit power imbalances to commit sexual genocide

Rebecca **[Gerome 2011]{.underline}**, consultant for the IANSA
(International Action Network on Small Arms) Women\'s Network, 2011,
"Limit Arms Exports to Reduce Violence Against Women", NATO Review,
<https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2011/Arms-control/201103-TextArt2/EN/index.htm>

**[[Marie was gang raped on 10 June 2010. "When you call for help,
people hear but they don't come out to help when there are people with
guns around]{.underline}]{.mark}**," she says.

Her story is one of many others in Amnesty International's January 2011
report on Haiti, entitled "Aftershocks: Women Speak Out About Sexual
Violence". **[[Most of the rape victims interviewed were threatened by
groups of men armed with guns]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Between February 28 and March 4 2011, states gathered in New York for
the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) Preparatory Committee**[. [Discussions on
the ATT present a vital opportunity to examine the tools used to commit
acts of gender-based violence - most often small arms and light
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** (SALW). Although many binding
international instruments exist on gender-based violence, these have not
been taken into consideration by the disarmament community.

What impact do international transfers of conventional arms and
ammunitions have on women's lives?

**[[Marie's story reveals the invisible impact of armed violence: its
impact on women's minds, bodies and freedom]{.mark}.]{.underline}** High
death and injury rates of men are the most obvious and visible effects
of gun violence. **[[Yet what fails to appear in statistics is when guns
are not used to kill but to exert power; when guns are used behind
closed doors to subjugate family members; when guns are used to threaten
adolescent girls with sexual violence, forcing entire families to
flee]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What **[[we fail to talk
about]{.underline}]{.mark}**, when we talk about small arms, are **[[the
rapes of tens of]{.mark} [thousands of women]{.mark}]{.underline}** at
gunpoint.

**[[There is a strong correlation between carrying small arms and
notions of masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, considered to be
traditional "gun-culture". Armed conflict can change men's views about
what qualifies as masculine behaviour: **[[group pressure can amplify
men's aggressiveness and inclination to treat women as
inferior]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Since almost all men are armed in times
of conflict, their weaponry can be implicated in the exercise of power
over women.

In Colombia, where 60 to 70 percent of women have experienced some form
of violence in their lives, **[[the presence of guns in society is
strongly linked to a patriarchal]{.underline}]{.mark}** and "machista"
**[[culture]{.mark},]{.underline}** which supports the notion that men
need guns to defend themselves and protect their families. Yet, instead
of providing security, **[[these guns aid and exacerbate violence
against women and girls]{.underline}]{.mark}**, both during and after
conflicts.

Guns aid and exacerbate violence against women and girls, both during
and after conflicts

During four days in the summer of 2010**[, [a mass rape occurred in
Luvungi, Eastern DRC]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Democratic Republic of
Congo). **[[Nearly all of the 303 reported rapes were described as
having been perpetrated by groups of two-to-six armed
men]{.underline}]{.mark}**, taking place in front of the women\'s
children and husbands. It is estimated that 200 million small arms are
in circulation in the Great Lakes region with a heavy concentration in
the east of the DRC.

**[[In Colombia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has the second highest
number of internally displaced people in the world after Sudan, **[[2
out 10 displaced women identify sexual violence as the direct cause of
their displacement]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In the armed conflict, all
parties use sexual violence as a weapon of war.

**[[In Sierra Leone's civil war]{.underline}]{.mark}** between 1991 and
2002, **[[64,000 women and girls suffered war-related sexual violence.
Testimonies of women explain how the assaults were endured at
gunpoint]{.underline}]{.mark}**. ´They put their guns to our throats and
stomachs to make sure that we followed their orders,' one woman
reported.

**[[In Libya, rape is also being used as a tactic to instill
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "They (\...) forced him to watch as two of
them took turns raping the woman," recounted a Tripoli resident
describing the invasion of a family member's home by four armed
militiamen.

The UN Security Council has recognised that rape in armed conflict is a
threat to international security. So why are so many guns being sold to
so many countries where rape is a strategy, a tactic to dehumanise and
subjugate?

It has been said that \"**[[For women, war is not over when it's
over.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** According to a 2007 study from
Montenegro, of 1500 women seeking assistance from women\'s shelters, 90
per cent were threatened with small arms by their partners. Often,
**[[guns brought home by off-duty soldiers, police and private security
guards are used to facilitate domestic violence.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
In her recent visit to the US, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence
against Women noted the widespread use of guns in domestic violence.

**[[By facilitating domination and violence against women, guns are used
to prevent women from exercising their basic rights on a daily
basis]{.mark};]{.underline}** in the marketplaces where they trade, in
the fields where they work, at water-points and along the roads where
girls walk to school.

From Haiti to the Balkans, the stories repeat themselves, endlessly.
Guns are being used to take away women's rights on a massive scale. So
why is gender-based violence not part of the discussion on the arms
trade?

**[[In 2009, the US reversed its position on the ATT and decided to
support negotiations. This policy shift by the world\'s largest arms
exporter, with a \$55 billion-a-year trade in conventional
weapons]{.mark} (40 per cent of the global total), [was a key step
forward]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, the European Union recently made its internal code of conduct
on arms exports legally binding in order to become a \"very credible
actor\" as a promoter of the ATT. The 2012 negotiations will not be
simple, but it is clear that to protect women's rights, **[[the relevant
binding international instruments covering gender-based violence must be
applied in arms transfer decisions]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Unsigning the treaty tells the globe that America doesn't care about genocidal violence\-\--fails to recognize the link between arms and atrocities\-\--the aff reverses

Thalif **[Deen 2019]{.underline}**, Director & Senior Editor UN Bureau
Inter Press Service, 4/29/2019, "U.S. Takes Back signature on Arms Trade
Treaty", Inter Press Service,
<http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/04/us-takes-back-signature-arms-trade-treaty/>

UNITED NATIONS, Apr 29 2019 (IPS) - **[[The United States dropped a
political bombshell when President Donald Trump announced his
administration would withdraw from the historic Arms Trade
Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}** (ATT) which the former Obama
administration signed in September 2013.

"We are taking our signature back", said Trump April 26, addressing a
meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA), one of the most
powerful gun lobbies in the US.

**[[The US, in effect, joins three other "rogue
states]{.underline}]{.mark}**" -- North Korea, Iran and Syria -- who
voted against the treaty at the UN General Assembly back in April 2013,
along with 23 countries that abstained on the voting, including China,
Russia, India, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.

Jayantha Dhanapala, a former UN Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament
Affairs and ex-President of the Pugwash, told IPS that President Trump
"continues to create mayhem in the field of disarmament by wrecking the
legal regime created by the international community at the behest of
vested interests in the gun lobby sacrificing the humanitarian norms of
the world to which the US has contributed."

The US, which has increasingly shown virtual contempt for
multilateralism, has already scuttled the 2015 multilateral nuclear
agreement with Iran, refused to participate in the global migration
compact, pulled out of the 2015 Paris climate change agreement,
abandoned the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, and
revoked the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.

Dr. Natalie J. Goldring, a Senior Fellow and Adjunct Full Professor with
the Security Studies Program in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign
Service at Georgetown University, told IPS President Trump is pandering
to the National Rifle Association yet again.

She said his announcement that the United States is **["un-signing" the
Arms Trade Treaty is yet another example of this administration's
abdication of responsibility in the arms control sphere.]{.underline}**

In the fact sheet announcing this decision, the Trump Administration
stated, "The ATT is simply not needed for the United States to engage in
responsible arms trade."

**["The Trump Administration has not been engaged in responsible arms
trade in any way, shape, or form. There is indisputable evidence that
Saudi Arabia, for example, consistently violates international human
rights and humanitarian law".]{.underline}**

"But the Trump Administration continues to pursue arms sales agreements
with the Saudi regime," said Dr Goldring, who is also a Visiting
Professor of the Practice in the Duke University Washington DC program.

She pointed out that the United States is the world's largest arms
dealer. **[[It's long past time for the United States to show leadership
on the global arms trade, rather than merely treating arms sales as
economic transactions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, she added.

The ATT, which was adopted by the United Nations in April 2013 and
entered into force in December 2014, was initiated by the UK, a NATO
ally of the US.

As of last week, the Treaty has 101 States Parties with ratifications,
and 34 countries are signatories but not States Parties.

Responding to questions at a press briefing April 26, UN spokesperson
Stephane Dujarric told reporters that the Arms Trade Treaty is the only
global instrument aimed at improving transparency and accountability in
the international arms trade.

"It is a landmark achievement in the efforts to ensure responsibility in
international arms transfers. This is particularly important in present
times, when we witness growing international tensions and renewed
interest in expanding and modernizing arsenals," he added.

Rachel Stohl, Managing Director at the Stimson Center and a consultant
who helped draft the text of the treaty, said that President Trump has
"once again walked away from America's leadership role in the world and
undermined international efforts to reduce human suffering caused by
irresponsible and illegal arms transfers".

In statement released here, Stohl said "Un-signing the Arms Trade Treaty
will undermine international peace and security, increase irresponsible
and illegal sales of conventional weapons, and harm the American
economy".

A transparent, responsible arms trade fundamentally serves U.S. national
security, promotes U.S. foreign policy objectives, and supports American
values.

**[[The ATT facilitates transparency and accountability in]{.mark} a
[global arms trade]{.mark} worth nearly \$90 billion a year, [building
confidence among governments and ending decades of impunity]{.mark}, she
declared.]{.underline}**

Dr Goldring said the US government regularly claims to have the
strongest global standards for arms transfers. Yet it seeks to abandon
the only legally binding treaty that addresses these issues.

"This may seem like a symbolic step, because the Trump Administration
had already made clear its lack of support for the treaty," she added.

But this act has substantive implications as well.

**[[It's in the US interest to be part of the ATT and to work with other
countries to increase their standards for importing and exporting
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**, she noted.

'**[[Unsigning' the ATT decreases our leverage with these countries. 'Do
as I say, not as I do' is a cynical and unpersuasive policy
approach]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Dr Goldring who also represents
the Acronym Institute at the United Nations on conventional weapons and
arms trade issues.

Abby Maxman, President of Oxfam America, [said **[Trump's decision to
un-sign the Arms Trade Treaty "is a]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[reckless,
[self-inflicted wound that continues to demonstrate the Administration's
desire to turn its back on global norms, standards and US
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is one more misguided step to
dismantle the international partnerships that keep us all safe."

Just last week, **[[the Administration held hostage a UN Security
Council resolution to address sexual violence in conflict-- until
language about the need for sexual & reproductive health services was
removed.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

And, it's no coincidence that this comes on the heels of President
Trump's veto of the Yemen War Powers Resolution and continued military
support for Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen, said Maxman.

**[[President Trump is sending a clear message to civilians caught in
the crossfire: "we don't care]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

The United States will now lock arms with Iran, North Korea and Syria as
non-signatories to this historic treaty whose sole purpose is to protect
innocent people from deadly weapons.

"**[[The Arms Trade Treaty was developed and signed by the US and others
to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of those who may use them to
commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The treaty has
the power to save millions from death, rape, assault and displacement.
Each year an estimated 500,000 people are killed as a result of the
unregulated and under-regulated arms trade]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said
Maxman.

#### The ATT is key\-\--it's the only international arms control legislation that intersectionally examines power structures relating the illicit arms trade and gendered violence

**[[The ATT is the first ever legally-binding regime that recognises the
link between]{.mark} gender-based violence ([GBV) and the international
arms trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[Under the ATT [it is
illegal to transfer weapons if there is a risk that the weapons will be
used to facilitate GBV]{.mark}]{.underline}** (article 7(4)). In
practice, this means that those conducting risk assessment processes for
the export and import of weapons will have to take into account
legislative and normative factors

around GBV in the recipient countries. Effective implementation of this
provision will help prevent GBV. **[[It will]{.mark} also [help build
understanding about risks]{.mark} and dangers [in]{.mark} potential
[recipient countries and about the links between the international arms
trade and GBV more broadly. This]{.mark} in turn [will enable more

violence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

ATT, Article 7: Export and Export Assessment

1\. If the export is not prohibited under Article 6, each exporting
State Party, prior to authorization of the export of conventional arms
covered under Article 2 (1) or of items covered under Article 3 or
Article 4, under its jurisdiction and pursuant to its national control
system, shall, in an objective and non-discriminatory manner, taking
into account relevant factors, including information provided by the
importing State in accordance with Article 8 (1), assess the potential
that the conventional arms or items:

\(a\) would contribute to or undermine peace and security; (b) could be
used to:

\(i\) commit or facilitate a serious violation of international
humanitarian law;

\(ii\) commit or facilitate a serious violation of international human
rights law;

\(iii\) commit or facilitate an act constituting an offence under
international conventions or protocols relating to terrorism to which
the exporting State is a Party; or

\(iv\) commit or facilitate an act constituting an offence under
international conventions or protocols relating to transnational
organized crime to which the exporting State is a Party.

2\. The exporting State Party shall also consider whether there are
measures that could be undertaken to mitigate risks identified in (a) or
(b) in paragraph 1, such as confidence-building measures or jointly
developed and agreed programmes by the exporting and importing States.

3\. If, after conducting this assessment and considering available
mitigating measures, the exporting State Party deter- mines that there
is an overriding risk of any of the negative consequences in paragraph
1, the exporting State Party shall not authorize the export.

4\. **[[The exporting State Party]{.mark}, in making this assessment,
[shall take into account the risk of the conventional
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}** covered under Article 2 (1) or of the items
covered under Article 3 or Article 4 **[[being used to commit or
facilitate serious acts of gender- based violence]{.mark} or serious
acts of violence against women and children.]{.underline}**

5\. Each exporting State Party shall take measures to ensure that all
authorizations for the export of conventional arms covered under Article
2 (1) or of items covered under Article 3 or Article 4 are detailed and
issued prior to the export.

6\. Each exporting State Party shall make available appropriate
information about the authorization in question, upon request, to the
importing State Party and to the transit or trans-shipment States
Parties, subject to its national laws, practices or policies.7. If,
after an authorization has been granted, an exporting State Party
becomes aware of new relevant information, it is encouraged to reassess
the authorization after consultations, if appropriate, with the
importing State.

Why a separate provision on preventing GBV?

Even if serious violations of international human rights law or
international humanitarian law, covered by the ATT's article 7(1), would
include serious acts of GBV or violence against women and children**[,
[it is important to have the GBV criterion included specifically, as
this form of violence is often overlooked because it disproportionately
affects women]{.mark}, who are in a disadvantaged position compared to
men when it comes to highlighting and confronting human rights
abuses]{.underline}**. Including this provision in the Treaty underlines
the need for prevention of GBV explicitly and makes its exclusion from
risk assessments more difficult. It further highlights that arms trade,
possession, and use have specific gender and power dimensions that need
to be further examined and addressed.

**[[The inclusion of the GBV criterion also serves as a reminder that in
accordance with UN gender mainstreaming practice]{.mark}, the impact on
all people of all policies and programmes needs to be taken into account
and [power structures that might be amplified by the presence of arms
need to be further examined.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This briefing paper aims to provide some background on the terminology
around GBV and to highlight questions that will be relevant for risk
assessments under article 6 and 7.

UN gender mainstreaming and armed conflict

Most UN strategies have focused only on women and only in special
isolated fora away from the organisation's every- day work, e.g. in the
Commission on the Status of Women (CSW ), open debates about UN Security
Council resolution 1325, and the Convention on the Elimination of all
Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

• The fourth UN World Conference on Women in 1995 produced the Beijing
Platform for Action, which included the effects of armed conflict on
women as one of the areas of concern where action on national and
international levels is required.

• UNSCR 1325 recognises the situation of women in armed conflict as
often being precarious and calls upon all states to allow an increased
participation of women on all decision-making levels concerning
international peace and security.

• UNSCR 1889 emphasises some socioeconomic aspects and acknowledges that
the lack of security undermines women's social, political, and economic
participation in the life a community.

• UNSCR 2117 recognises that the illicit transfer, destabilising
accumulation, and misuse of small arms and light weapons exacerbate
sexual and gender-based violence.

• UNSCR 2122 says the Council is "looking forward to the important
contribution that implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty can make to
reducing violence perpetrated against women and girls in armed conflict
and post-con- flict situations."

The "women, peace and security" (WPS) agenda needs to be better
incorporated into discussions, programmes, poli- cies, and legislation
related to weapons and the arms trade in order to guarantee equal
security for all and gender diversity in terms of participation. The
traditionally androcentric approach to international humanitarian law
and the depiction of women as passive actors in law and politics has had
a devastating impact in particular on women's securi- ty and ability to
participate fully and equitably in a wide spectrum of roles and
responsibilities.

What is gender?

Gender does not refer to biological sex, but rather to socially
constructed ideas that attribute meaning to and differentiate between
sexes. Socially constructed understandings of gender affect perceptions
of social roles, behaviour, and identity, and have implications for
relations between people.

Conceptions of gender provide a way of structuring relations of power,
whether in families, societies, or even in international relations. For
example, in the family these structures are often visible in the
traditional role of men as a protector and provider and women as a
caretaker as well as the one responsible for the household. However, all
these socially constructed roles are not innate or constant; they can
alter and change over time.

Using a gender perspective means examining how these constructed gender
roles might affect policy decisions or budgets. It also means being
sensitive to the fact that women and men may be differently affected,
may play different roles, and may have different experiences in a
particular situation due to their sex or expectations about gender.

Questions of gender do not exclusively concern women, but all sexes and
sexual and gender identities. It is also important to recognise that
"women" is not a homogeneous social category, including when it comes to
experiences of war and armed conflict.

Recognising the diversity of experiences, interests, and agencies of all
actors is necessary to ensure that any approach to addressing the
challenges of armed violence and conflict are applied in the most
effective, integrated way possible.

What is gender-based violence?

**[[Gender-based violence (GBV) is the most prevalent form of violence
in the world]{.mark}. It exists and is widespread in all countries and
all societie]{.underline}**s**[. GBV is violence that is directed at a
person based on her or his specific sex or gender role in
society]{.underline}**. It is linked to the gendered identity of being a
woman, man, intersex, transsexual, or transgendered. **[[The term GBV
recognises that violence takes place as a result of unequal power
relations and discrimination in society on the basis of one's sex or
gender.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

There are different types of GBV that can be grouped into these four
categories:

• Sexual violence: Sexual harassment, rape, forced prostitution, sexual
violence during conflict and harmful customary or traditional practices
such as female genital mutilation, forced marriages, and honour crimes.

• Physical violence: Physical assault, domestic violence, human
trafficking and slavery, forced sterilisation, forced abortion.

• Emotional and psychological violence: Abuse, humiliation, and
confinement.

• Socioeconomic violence: Discrimination and/or denial of opportunities
and services; prevention of the exercise and enjoyment of civil, social,
economic, cultural, and political rights.

**[[The most prevalent form of GBV is violence against women and girls.
Here, the root cause of violence lays in the unequal power-relation
between men and women and it cuts across age, race, ethnicity, religion,
sexuality, income levels, and geographic
location.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Why also include a reference to gender-based violence and not just to
women and children?

**[[It was important to include the reference to
GBV]{.underline}]{.mark}** in addition to the reference to violence
against women and children for two main reasons:

1\. GBV includes any act of violence against anyone on the basis of
their sex or gender. The arms trade affects everyone---women, men,
girls, and boys---differently. Women and girls are disproportionately
affected by GBV carried out by men. **[[Using the term GBV acknowledges
these power and structural dimensions of armed violence, from the
perspective of both perpetrators and victims]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

2\. **[[Grouping women and children in one category undermines women's
agency as adult participants]{.mark} of society and implies that women,
like children, are powerless victims in need of help and
protection]{.underline}**. This is incorrect and unhelpful for
identifying obstacles and resources for combatting armed violence. It is
therefore vital to make the distinction between women and children to
ensure both that each group is given the specific attention it requires
and is enabled

to make the contributions of which it is capable. All relevant actors
must take care to highlight women's key roles in preventing gender-based
violence and in participating in arms control and disarmament
negotiations and initiatives, conflict prevention and resolution, and
peace-building, in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions
on women, peace and security (1325 and its follow-on resolutions) and UN
General Assembly resolution 69/61 on "Women, disarmament,
non-proliferation, and arms control".

Why does the ATT matter in relation to GBV?

Acts of GBV can occur in conflict or non-conflict settings both in the
domestic and the public sphere. GBV is rooted in discriminatory social
norms and power inequalities in social, economic, and political spheres
of life. In a number of contexts involving armed conflict globally,
rape, and sexual assault have been used as a tactic to humiliate,
intimidate, displace, and traumatise communities. They have also been
used by armed actors as "spoils of war".

The use of rape and sexual assault as a tactic or as spoils of war has a
deep, tacit link with the acceptability of all forms of GBV during times
of peace. During armed conflict, and in other humanitarian contexts,
social norms are redrawn and acts that may not have been acceptable
previously may become common place--- especially in contexts where one
social group is psychologically dehumanised by another. In that context,
due to prevailing gender hierarchies, women and other groups that are
already marginalised and discriminated against in peaceful times often
find themselves increasingly targeted during armed conflicts.

**[[While arms themselves may not always be directly implicated in such
violence, they are correlated with an increase in gendered inequality
and a generalised culture of violence against women]{.mark} in
particular. Furthermore, the proliferation of arms has a negative impact
on women's equality]{.underline}** within the household, their mobility,
and their political participation. Widespread possession and use of
weapons tends to prevent women from fully participating in public and
political life, and to hinder their economic empowerment, which also
qualifies as GBV.

#### Arms Control changes need a gendered lens\-\--imperative for inclusion, root causal studies, and shifting understandings

Policy Change project at New America\'s Political Reform program,
December 2017, "Arms Control needs the Modernizing Lens that Gender
Offers", Arms Control Association,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/90016016

**[At a moment when the field of arms control and security faces
existential challenges,]{.underline}** **[[it may seem foolish to insist
that one of the sector's problems is a failure to incorporate]{.mark}
thinking about [gender]{.mark}]{.underline}**. After all, achievements
over a half-century in institution building and norm creation, even the
most basic norms against the use of nuclear weapons, are under attack.

Yet in an important sense, **[the community is confronting its 21st
century opposition with a 1950s mindset.]{.underline}** The politics of
the last year showed people in the United States---whether recent
graduates or new members of Congress voting on budget funds and
authorizations for use of military force---to be broadly unaware of core
principles such as deterrence and basic facts about U.S. arsenals and
the shape of global threats. At the same time, they are hearing about
security through ever-more intimate and personal lenses.
**[[Identity-linked advocacy networks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, from
Concerned Women for America to the Movement for Black Lives to veterans
and religious organizations, **[[are increasingly shaping the way
Americans]{.mark} receive news and [understand the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center
for Nonproliferation Studies, received this phone message about a caller
seeking a woman expert on North Korea to participate in a 10-minute
roundtable. As research carried out last year showed, **[[national
security professionals are likely to believe the best response to
differences in policymaking is to remove it rather than embrace
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That impulse was once the state of the
art---"I don't see race" or "men and women are converging"---but is no
longer. **[[A community that fails to catch up on diversity]{.mark}, as
reflected in who participates and what perspectives are considered,
[will fail to compete]{.mark} for talented personnel, as well as for
relevance, [in a diverse world.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Elsewhere in the security field, **[[gender has moved beyond]{.mark} the
personnel department. [Scholars have documented how]{.mark} differing
[experiences of gender affect policy outcomes]{.mark}, most [notably how
closely linked the treatment of women is to the prevalence of violence
within]{.mark} and between [societies]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
In response, institutions from the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) to NATO and the United Nations have begun to
practice analysis and policymaking that explicitly take gender
difference into account.

The field faces two related but distinct challenges: diversifying the
people who work in it and the perspectives it recognizes. **[[The arms
control and security policy sector is still overwhelmingly white]{.mark}
and upper-middle class, [and]{.mark} disproportionately [male]{.mark},
especially in its highest echelons]{.underline}**. Despite the reams of
evidence and successful practices to emulate from other fields, the
sector is only at the very beginning of remaking itself so that it can
successfully compete for talent and connect with the majority of
Americans, much less the rest of the world.

Despite rich generations of feminist scholarship, **[[the arms control
sector lags well behind others in bringing a gender lens]{.mark}, that
is, the ability to consider how policies affect the genders differently,
to its work.]{.underline}**

Finally Get Serious About Diversity

First, there is a tendency to complacency about gender representation in
the arms control and security sector. After all, goes the reasoning, Rex
Tillerson is just the second white male U.S. secretary of state in 20
years, and a list of illustrious female practitioners tends to follow.
Yet, those high-profile achievers mask a more disappointing overall
picture. As women's representation has progressed then seemed to
plateau, across the general economy, the private sector has led in
developing and implementing practices that seek to remedy gender
imbalances. On this, government has lagged, and the national security
sector with it. Female representation in national security policymaking
has progressed only slowly, despite taking a dramatic jump at upper
levels during the Obama administration.2

It would be wrong, however, to regard this trend as irreversible or well
institutionalized. The Center for a New American Security (CNAS)
documented the precipitous falloff in women's representation that
continues to occur at the upper levels of civilian and military
government service.3 Although in recent years half of entering U.S.
Foreign Service officers have been female, only 30 percent of senior
staff are; at the Pentagon, just 20 percent of senior jobs are held by
women.4 The Trump administration's attempts to freeze or roll back
civilian hiring at the Department of State and elsewhere in government
were accompanied by lopsided ratios among its political appointees.5
Moreover, discussion among top administration officials and allies about
returning to a ban on women in combat roles and the promotion by Vice
President Mike Pence and others of cultural norms that prohibit women
meeting alone with men6 seem likely to further depress women's equal
participation now, as well as limit younger women's chances to advance
for years to come. Further, due to hiring freezes, shifts to
contractors, and priority given to hiring older veterans, the proportion
of the federal workforce under age 30 has fallen to 7 percent from a
high of 25 percent 40 years ago. Gender balance among interns and
students in their twenties is thus almost irrelevant to the current
workings of U.S. government. Senior leadership in this and future
administrations will need to take explicit measures to repair the damage
and promote diversity at all levels.

At present, that means focusing on the inclusion of women outside
government. From academia to think tanks, from students to journal
authorship to board membership, the outlook is still disappointing.

Considering academia matters because it is the main pipeline through
which young professionals enter the field and it is where they gain
their expectations about what it means to work in security policy.
Although women have made up more than half of undergraduate students for
almost 40 years, they are underrepresented in the postgraduate and
specialized programs that lead to security sector careers. CNAS found
that a number of the most prestigious graduate programs in international
relations are less than half female.7 Women who enter the security field
by joining the military continue to face disproportionate obstacles; as
one example, entering classes at the service academies have surpassed 20
percent women only very recently.

Although cross-field studies have not been done, a casual look at
rosters and tables of contents confirms that gender disparities among
students increase among tenure-track faculty and skyrocket for
publication in elite journals. Recent years have seen graduate students
organize at Georgetown University to demand a response to the prevalence
of all-male reading lists and at Columbia University and Tufts
University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy to press for more
consideration of gender issues in the curriculum. Faculty members say
that many such efforts, while impressively prepared and resourced by a
given cohort of students, are allowed by administrations to lapse when
that cohort graduates. There are some examples of schools making
explicit commitments, such as Fletcher School Dean James Stavridis'
target of a 40 percent female tenure-track faculty, but choosing not to
publicize them.

Photos/Public Domain)Gender representation in the nongovernmental
security sector has received considerably less attention, but what is
known is discouraging. In 2016, a survey carried out by the University
of Texas LBJ School of Public Policy found elite foreign policy
think-tank scholars in the United States to be 75 percent male.8
Globally, a 2014 survey of a network of 43 think tanks found staff to be
42 percent female, but leadership only 14 percent.9 Ploughshares Fund,
in the process of developing a yet-to-launch "Women's Initiative," did
its own informal survey of the nuclear nonprofit sector and found that
although women were strongly represented at entry levels, senior jobs
and, above all, boards remain seriously imbalanced.10

Staffing is just one piece of the representation puzzle; visibility is
another. Female experts are badly underrepresented in media coverage of
security issues as sources in print media and guests on TV and radio. A
study found that, of 6,000 guests on national news segments covering
foreign policy and national security in 2016, only 24 percent were
women.11

Debates have raged within institutions and among community members about
the prevalence of all-male-speaker panels, or "manels," which continue
to be an issue in the arms control field. Surprisingly few U.S.
institutions, programs, or funders have taken what is known as the "no
manels" pledge. The possibilities for improvement are large. The
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's International Nuclear
Policy Conference, for example, went from 10 percent female panelists in
2011 to 30 percent in 2015 and 49 percent in 2017, according to James
Acton, one of the organizers. Anecdotally, however, senior women and men
who have been outspoken on the topic confirm that resistance is intense.

'Gender Lens'

**[Diversity theory indicates that broadening the perspectives of those
who make policy produces better outcomes. The other side of that coin is
the concept of a "gender lens," that is, the idea that policy analysis
that considers the different experiences of different genders can
produce such better policy outcomes]{.underline}**. The concept has
gained traction in academic circles and in peacekeeping and conflict
resolution training in the UN and NATO and some other regional security
bodies, but it is little known in U.S. policymaking and not applied at
all in the arms control space.

**[Socially constructed norms and patterns ensure that [people of
different genders have different experiences. This]{.mark} commonplace
observation [has important consequences for security policy]{.mark}. For
example, violent [extremist groups]{.mark} [exploit gender norms to
recruit women]{.mark}, deploy women in contexts and societies where
women are not expected to be agents of violence, [and heighten feelings
of victimization]{.mark} and vulnerability among their
targets]{.underline}**.12 Similarly, counterterrorism analysts have
documented important patterns and moments where women's roles in
traditional, as well as Western, societies can be key in detecting or
preventing radicalization. Slowly, policymakers are starting to take
notice.13

In conflict resolution and peacekeeping, analysis has documented that
**[[the inclusion of women makes peace agreements more durable]{.mark},
while [failing to take]{.mark} differently [gender]{.mark}ed needs [into
account]{.mark} in postconflict stabilization [can contribute to the
re-emergence of violent groups]{.mark}. UN Women has found that [peace
processes that include women are]{.mark} 20 percent more likely to last
at least two years and [35 percent more likely to last 15
years]{.mark}]{.underline}**.14 Yet, new research found that women have
made up just 8 percent of peace negotiators over the past 27 years.15

Security framework, constructed through seven UN Security Council
resolutions, now provides guidelines for training on and planning and
evaluation of peacekeeping and conflict resolution work. NATO and other
regional organizations have followed suit, as have military and civilian
planners from a number of key U.S. allies. Just this fall, U.S.
President Donald Trump signed into law the bipartisan Women, Peace and
Security Act of 2017, which directs but does not require U.S. security
policymakers to incorporate these best practices into U.S. government
work. Congress did not appropriate any new resources for this task,
however, and positions focusing on gender stand empty at the National
Security Council, State Department,

and USAID.

Moreover**[, hard [data indicates how gendered dynamics contribute to
conflict]{.mark}. Measures of [violence against women]{.mark} [have
emerged as some of the best predictors for outbreaks of violence]{.mark}
within and [between states]{.mark}.16 Scholars are doing important new
work on a variety of indicators, not all associated with women.
Societies in which young men are less able to attain the symbols of
successful adult masculinity, such as marriage, employment, and
community status, may be more vulnerable to violence.17]{.underline}**

**[Students and [practitioners of arms control and security disciplines
need to catch up to the research on causes of
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Although the indicators connecting
gender violence to risk of broader societal conflict are robust, surveys
by New America have found that work to be almost unknown among national
security elites.18 Professionals in and out of government owe it to
themselves to become familiar with the findings.

Although "gender" is often associated with feminist or other politically
progressive worldviews, the observation that violence against women and
societal violence are closely linked also dovetails comfortably with
ideologically conservative frameworks that see protecting the vulnerable
and traditional family structures as a key goal of security policy**[.
[The observations themselves are ideologically
neutral.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Recommendations

The following are seven recommendations for action. Not every actor in
the field---government agencies, think tanks, advocacy groups,
international actors, and scholars---can take up every recommendation.
All can do at least one, becoming more effective policymakers as a
result.

Make the gender lens a standard tool of analysis. As Fletcher School
scholar Meg Guliford wrote recently, security "is contextual. There
exists no blanket definition to encapsulate how all human beings
experience security." This observation is the foundation of gender
analysis, the practice of considering how policies or events affect
different genders differently. **[[Gender analysis yields important
insights in counterterrorism and countering violent extremism
thought]{.mark}, whether predicting the movements of extremist groups
from the flows of female recruits or learning about ISIS' internal
cohesion from its practice of systemic rape against women and men. [Yet,
it is not broadly]{.mark} known, used, or [taught in the international
security field.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Widen the research lens. The time is ripe for an imaginative research
agenda where such dynamics might be at play in the use and control of
weapons. For example, **[little is known about how such dynamics might
play out in the demand for, use of, and success or failure in
controlling small arm]{.underline}**s**[, but that is more than what is
known about what measures of societal insecurity are most likely to
drive governments to acquire more disruptive weapons systems or become
more aggressive in their use]{.underline}**. Does the insecurity of
women and other vulnerable populations have a bearing on nations' or
groups' willingness to lay down arms or forbear particular capabilities
or systems?

New insights are likely waiting for researchers who widen the lens to
perceive women as negotiators and combatants and men as victims of
sexual violence, as well as perpetrators. **[[The literature on women's
participation in peace negotiations and their implementation would
likely be enriched and challenged by consideration of women in arms
control negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, from the Iran nuclear deal
to the negotiations leading to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons.

Conventional Defense Program, 5/3/19, "Trump unsings the Arms Trade
Treaty: How Did We Get Here?", War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/trump-unsigns-the-arms-trade-treaty-how-did-we-get-here/

You might have heard that **[President Donald [Trump struck
another]{.mark} fatal [blow to]{.mark} multilateral [diplomacy]{.mark}
last week [when he announced]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [would withdraw]{.mark} its signature [from the
A]{.mark}rms [T]{.mark}rade [T]{.mark}reaty]{.underline}** and would no
longer seek to ratify the landmark agreement regulating the
international trade in conventional weapons. With great flair and
flourish, Trump signed a letter while onstage at the National Rifle
Association's annual conference asking for the Senate to return the Arms
Trade Treaty to the White House so it could "be disposed of." While this
act may prove politically expedient for Trump in the short term, it is
wrought with longer-term strategic and diplomatic challenges that could
haunt the United States for years to come.

In remarks crafted to appeal to special interest groups, Trump repeated
typical gun lobby talking points about the Arms Trade Treaty that
demonstrate a willful mischaracterization of the treaty's intent and
effect. Commenting that the treaty threatens the rights of U.S.
citizens,
Trump [exclaimed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-nra-ila-leadership-forum-indianapolis/) that
"we will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second
Amendment freedom" and that "we will never surrender American
sovereignty to anyone." **[Such [statements]{.mark} not only reinforce a
false narrative about the Arms Trade Treaty, but [risk isolating
the]{.mark} United States [from its]{.mark} closest [allies that remain
committed to]{.mark} increasing [responsibility,]{.mark} mitigating
[human rights]{.mark} abuses, [and]{.mark} addressing [security]{.mark}
concerns associated [with]{.mark} the unregulated global [trade]{.mark}
in conventional arms.]{.underline}**

What Does the Arms Trade Treaty Do?

[Contrary to the president's
statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/29/trumps-decision-leave-global-arms-treaty-was-built-an-nra-lie/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ceb90befac4f),
the Arms Trade Treaty does not limit U.S. sovereignty over arms export
decisions, nor does it put a foreign government in charge of U.S.
domestic regulations. **[The [treaty]{.mark} [regulates]{.mark} only the
international trade in conventional [arms]{.mark} --- that's all weapons
from small arms to fighter jets and everything in between. Its stated
purpose is [to]{.mark} [contribute]{.mark} to international peace and
security and reduce human suffering caused by the irresponsible and
illicit arms trade]{.underline}**. **[The Arms Trade Treaty also
promotes transparency and [accountability]{.mark} in the global arms
trade]{.underline}** by requiring governments to report annually on
their arms exports and imports, building confidence in what has
historically been an opaque business.

**[[The [treaty](https://www.thearmstradetreaty.org/hyper-images/file/ATT_English/ATT_English.pdf?templateId=137253) encourages]{.mark}
governments [to stop supplying]{.mark} lethal [weapons of war to]{.mark}
human rights abusers[, violators of]{.mark} international [humanitarian
law, terrorists, and]{.mark} organized [criminals]{.mark}]{.underline}**
by prohibiting certain kinds of arms transfers and establishing specific
criteria for making arms transfer decisions (all of which are already
reflected in [U.S.
law](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&sys_id=b9a933addb7c930044f9ff621f961932) and [regulations](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&sys_id=24d528fddbfc930044f9ff621f961987)).
These are not controversial measures. It is common sense to ensure that
the weapons the United States sells are used for the purposes intended
and do not undermine American national security interests, foreign
policy objectives, economic priorities, or principles and values.

In simple terms, the Arms Trade Treaty tells governments what to do in
order to participate in the arms trade responsibly, but not how to do
it. **[[It provides a]{.mark} flexible [approach that allows]{.mark}
governments to right-size their national arms [transfer control
systems]{.mark} --- the laws, regulations, and policies that governments
have to control arms moving into, out of, and through their
territories]{.underline}**. Not everyone needs a system as sophisticated
as the United States, for example --- no other country does as much arms
trading. **[But the treaty mandates that participating governments have
national control systems with control lists of items that are subject to
import, export, brokering and transit and transshipment
regulations.]{.underline}** These requirements are common-sense elements
of every national control system. They do not create a burden. Rather,
they simply make legitimate trade more efficient and help curb diversion
of legal weapons to illegal markets. For example, the treaty requires
governments to develop laws and regulations for arms brokering ---
closing a loophole that has allowed nefarious arms brokers to skirt a
patchwork of national laws and avoid detection. While
Trump's [remarks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-nra-ila-leadership-forum-indianapolis/) seriously
misrepresent the nature and purpose of the treaty, he was right about
one thing: Most Americans have never heard of the Arms Trade
Treaty. [The
treaty](https://www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/arms-trade-treaty-2/) was [negotiated](https://www.thearmstradetreaty.org/) over
a five-year period that began in the George W. Bush administration, was
adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in April 2013, and was signed by
then-Secretary of State John Kerry several months later.

I spent those years as the consultant to the treaty process --- from its
beginnings as a group of governmental experts examining the scope,
parameters, and feasibility of an Arms Trade Treaty through two
negotiating conferences. One of the reasons I was selected as the
consultant was because I was an American who understood the U.S. export
control system and the concerns of U.S. negotiators. I worked closely
with the conference presidents and diplomats from the United States and
around the world looking for compromises in text language to develop a
treaty that made a meaningful difference. Having the United States on
board, as the world's largest arms exporter, was important to the
diplomats negotiating the treaty, and sacrifices were made by those
demanding stronger and more specific language in order to keep the
United States at the table.

With all the concessions made to get the United States to sign on to the
treaty, unfortunately, the Obama administration never sold the treaty's
virtues to the American public or Congress. This neglect allowed a false
narrative about the Arms Trade Treaty --- largely propagated
by [conservative
groups](https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/why-the-us-must-unsign-the-arms-trade-treaty-2018) and
gun-rights activists, such as those at the [National Rifle
Association](https://www.nraila.org/search/?t=5858) --- to take hold and
dominate the discussion. With no champions on the Hill, the treaty has
been allowed to languish in the Senate since it was first transmitted
for consideration of ratification in 2016 with no action.

Getting Up from the Table

Even though the U.S. government remained silent on the Arms Trade Treaty
domestically, it actively participated in discussions on the treaty
internationally at the working group level and at [Conferences of States
Parties](https://www.thearmstradetreaty.org/past-conferences.html?templateId=209850),
speaking up when proposals were not in the U.S. interest or when
diplomats tried to interpret the treaty in ways inconsistent with the
actual text. **[[Participation]{.mark} in these meetings has helped
[ensure]{.mark} that [U.S.]{.mark} perspectives and [interests]{.mark}
were heard and taken into consideration as the treaty matured. In
walking away from the treaty now, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[will have to rely on]{.mark} other [countries to serve as guarantors
for U.S. interests]{.mark} --- a role that is best played by the United
States itself. Now countries can promote treaty interpretation or
establish common practices that are more consistent with their views and
experiences and which ignore U.S. perspectives]{.underline}**.

Treaty critics, including the president himself, point out that Russia
and China remain outside the treaty. But so too do Iran, North Korea,
Syria, India, and Pakistan, many of which have tense relationships with
the United States. After Trump's theatrics last week, [China
announced](https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d514f78677a4d34457a6333566d54/index.html) that
it was considering joining the Arms Trade Treaty. **[[China]{.mark}
[has]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [opposed]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [treaty]{.mark}
in principle, [rather]{.mark} it initially did not approve of how the
treaty was adopted at the United Nations. [China]{.mark}
[regularly]{.mark} [participates]{.mark} in treaty meetings as an
observer [but]{.mark} has upped the ante in light of the Trump
announcement.]{.underline}** **[China [is]{.mark} [clearly]{.mark}
[taking]{.mark} [advantage]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[leadership]{.mark} [void]{.mark} that Trump has opened up, using the
opportunity to move from cautious observer to a near enthusiastic
supporter of the treaty]{.underline}** --- a shrewd political move. No
one knows how the president's decision will be implemented. Senior
administration officials said during a phone briefing last Friday that
they are unsure about how the mechanics of the decision will work and
whether the United States will attend and participate in future Arms
Trade Treaty meetings. This is concerning. If the United States is not
in the room, it cannot make sure that the future of the treaty remains
consistent with U.S. interests. By abdicating responsibility, the United
States is ceding space to others to influence the interpretation and
implementation of the treaty.

Where to from Here?

The Arms Trade Treaty is aspirational, but it does not act in isolation.
The treaty is not a panacea to solve every problem associated with the
global transfer and use of conventional weapons but rather is one tool
in a diverse and varied toolbox available for states to ensure
responsibility in the international arms trade. And while there are
problems with the treaty text --- due to compromises made to get the
United States on board the treaty --- more than 100 governments are
party to the treaty (including most U.S. allies), and more than 30
additional governments have signed on to it, cementing new norms and
standards for operating in a previously unregulated global arms trade.
The Arms Trade Treaty will survive without the United States, but not
having the world's largest arms exporter inside the treaty undermines
its intent.

**[U.S[. negotiators saw this treaty as]{.mark} an [opportunity to
raise]{.mark} other [countries up to the U.S. standard]{.mark} and level
the playing field for American industry]{.underline}**, which was
subject to stricter national controls and more complicated bureaucratic
processes than those found in other countries. U.S. negotiators
recognized that the Arms Trade Treaty would face a challenging political
environment within the United States and therefore made it clear that
the treaty did not create additional responsibilities or burdens for
U.S. industry, nor require changes to U.S. laws or regulations. U.S.
industry [supported these
efforts](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/04/trump-withdrawal-arms-trade-treaty-could-harm-us-industry/156621/?oref=d-river) because
they seek efficiency and predictability in an increasingly globalized
market. Nothing will change for U.S. exporters when the United States
unsigns the treaty, as they will still be subject to strict U.S. export
control laws. But, these exporters could see their supply chains or
access to customers put at risk if a trading partner puts limits with
those countries that are not signatories or parties to the treaty.

As mentioned, on April 29, the president sent a letter to the Senate
saying that ratification of the treaty is not in America's interest and
asking for it to be returned to the White House. Once that occurs, the
president should stay quiet on the Arms Trade Treaty. He has
accomplished his political objectives and given a win to an embattled
special interest group. Another administration can reconsider the U.S.
role in the Arms Trade Treaty in the future and seek treaty
ratification. **[But [the damage]{.mark} to the U.S. relationship with
partners and allies will likely take longer to repair. The United States
[has sent a signal]{.mark} with this announcement --- that it will no
longer be bound by the object and purpose of the Arms Trade Treaty. [Not
having the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as a]{.mark} treaty [partner
legitimizes the irresponsible transfers]{.mark} of countries like
Russia, Iran, and North Korea]{.underline}**. It tells governments that
they do not have to utilize restraint in their arms transfer decisions.
Yes, the United States will continue to follow its national laws and
regulations, but the bad behavior of those countries that do not have
such strict standards has now become much harder for the United States

Getting Up from the Table

Even though the U.S. government remained silent on the Arms Trade Treaty
domestically, it actively participated in discussions on the treaty
internationally at the working group level and at Conferences of States
Parties, speaking up when proposals were not in the U.S. interest or
when diplomats tried to interpret the treaty in ways inconsistent with
the actual text. Participation in these meetings has helped ensure that
U.S. perspectives and interests were heard and taken into consideration
as the treaty matured. [**[In walking away]{.underline}** **[from the
treaty]{.underline}**]{.mark} now, [**[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[will have to rely on other countries to serve]{.mark} as guarantors
for [U.S. interests]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- a role that is best
played by the United States itself. **[Now countries can promote treaty
interpretation or establish]{.underline}** common **[practices that
are]{.underline}** more **[consistent with their views]{.underline}**
and experiences **[and which ignore U.S. perspectives.]{.underline}**

**[Treaty critics]{.underline}**, including the president himself,
**[point out]{.underline}** that **[Russia and China remain outside the
treaty]{.underline}**. But so too do Iran, North Korea, Syria, India,
and Pakistan, many of which have tense relationships with the United
States. **[[After Trump's theatrics]{.underline}]{.mark}** last week,
**[[China announced]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [**[it was considering
joining the]{.underline}** **[A]{.underline}**]{.mark}rms
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty.

**[China]{.underline}** regularly **[participates in treaty

**[[opened]{.underline}]{.mark}** up, **[using the opportunity to move

treaty]{.underline}** --- **[a shrewd political move.]{.underline}** No
one knows how the president's decision will be implemented. Senior
administration officials said during a phone briefing last Friday that
they are unsure about how the mechanics of the decision will work and
whether the United States will attend and participate in future Arms

[[China is considering joining the]{.underline}]{.mark} Arms Trade
Treaty ([[ATT]{.underline}]{.mark}), said Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesperson Geng Shuang on Tuesday, [adding that the country supports
the ATT\'s goals.]{.underline}

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng **[[Shuang made the comments
after]{.mark}]{.underline}** U.S. President Donald **[[Trump
announced]{.underline}]{.mark}** on April 26 that **[[the United States
was withdrawing from the ATT]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which regulates
international trade in conventional arms and seeks to prevent and
eradicate illicit trade and diversion of conventional arms by
establishing international standards governing arms transfers.

**[China said]{.underline}** Tuesday **[it hopes that relevant countries
can do more to strengthen the mechanism of international arms control
and safeguard international and regional peace and
stability.]{.underline}**

Calling the ATT an important multilateral treaty in the field of
conventional arms control, **[[Geng said that China supports the

### A2 \-\-- US not k2 Multilat

#### The ATT is key to multilateralism and mitigating conflict\-\--having the U.S. on board sends signals of responsibility globally

Pablo Arrocha **[Olabuenaga 19]{.underline}**, Legal Adviser of the
Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations, 5/8/19, "Why the Arms
Trade Treaty Matters -- and Why It matters That the US is Walking Away",
Just Security,
https://www.justsecurity.org/63968/why-the-arms-trade-treaty-matters-and-why-it-matters-that-the-us-is-walking-away/

In a nutshell, **[[the ATT sets]{.mark} out [global standards to
conduct]{.mark} legal and rightful [activities in]{.mark} a [transparent
manner. This]{.mark}, in turn[, helps to identify]{.mark} where and [how
arms are diverted into the illicit market and raises]{.mark} the bar
regarding [accountability]{.mark} for irresponsible transfers of
arms.]{.underline}**

What does the ATT not do? **[It is not a disarmament treaty nor a treaty
for the reduction of arsenals; it does not prohibit the international
trade in arms, and; it does not regulate, in any way, internal
transactions]{.underline}**, **[in particular the acquisition of arms by
civilians]{.underline}**. Contrary to what Trump has declared, the
treaty explicitly reaffirms "the sovereign right of any State to
regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory,
pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system." In other words, the
ATT is absolutely silent on controls, regulations, limitations, rights
or obligations regarding the domestic sale of arms. Therefore, claiming
that the ATT breaches sovereign rights of States, specifically the
second amendment to the U.S. Constitution, is not a matter of
misinterpretation: It is simply not true.

It is also very important to understand what is the extent of the legal
obligations arising from signing the ATT. A signatory to an
international treaty is not a State Party. According to Article 18 of
the [Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties](http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf)(VCLT)
of 1969, a State that has signed a treaty has the obligation to refrain
from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of said treaty. No
more and no less. The signature does not unfold the totality of the
rights and obligations established in the treaty. This would only happen
if the State became a party, having expressed its consent to be bound,
namely through ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.

It is also worth noting that there is no such thing as a revocation of
signature of treaties in the VCLT. However, the obligation not to defeat
the object and purpose of a treaty arising from its signature lasts
until the State has made its intention clear not to become a party to
the treaty, which presumably will be the case of the ATT (as of the time
of writing of this essay, no notification in this regard has been
deposited by the U.S. before the U.N. Treaty Section, which serves as
depositary of the Treaty).

A historic achievement of multilateralism

The adoption of the ATT was widely praised, and rightly so. Following
the adoption of the ATT, the U.N. issued a [press
release](https://www.un.org/press/en/2013/ga11354.doc.htm) stating:

**["To a burst of sustained applause, the General Assembly today voted
overwhelmingly in favour of a "historic", first-ever treaty to regulate
the astonishing number of conventional weapons traded each year, making
it more difficult for them to be diverted into the hands of those intent
on sowing the seeds of war and conflict."]{.underline}**

The President of the Final UN Conference, Amb. Woolcott, wrote:

"The UN had not seen success in negotiating a multilateral arms control
agreement since the 1990s. **[The [adoption of the Treaty by]{.mark} an
overwhelming [majority of States]{.mark} in the UN General Assembly
[is]{.mark} a major [achievement for the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations
[and]{.mark} for [multilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When the
Treaty's regular Conference of States Parties takes hold, it will
underscore that the discussion and scrutiny of the international arms
trade have firmly found a place on the multilateral agenda."
(Introduction to the book Weapons and international law: The Arms Trade
Treaty, 2015)

Finally, In the preface to the book Le Traite sur le Commerce des
Armes by Loïc Simonet, Dr. Óscar Arias wrote:

"...I am both proud and deeply relieved that as I write these words in
October 2014, we have defied the odds. We have made history. The Arms
Trade Treaty was adopted on 2nd April 2013 by a large majority of the UN
General Assembly. (...) As we look back on our history of violence, we
took a powerful step towards peace. For the first time in history, a
legally binding instrument established a common regulatory framework for
international transfers of conventional arms, and therefore set up
universal legal standards for the arms trade, on one of the few areas of
global commerce which had escaped any control until now. **[The [treaty
has]{.mark} the [power to reduce]{.mark} human [suffering and contribute
to]{.mark} international [peace, security and
stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To be honest, it is an achievement I
never expected to witness. I never thought that an idea that first took
shape so many years ago would become a part of international law in my
lifetime."

**[Given the great difficulties it encompassed as well as the great real
impact it can have on the ground in reducing human suffering, the
adoption of the ATT was indeed a historical achievement of the
international community]{.underline}**. It also reaffirmed the relevance
of the United Nations and multilateral diplomacy, in particular in an
area as controversial as the regulation of conventional arms, and in
which no progress had been registered for so many years.

**[According to [Amnesty
International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/gun-violence/),
more than 500 people die every day from gun violence, 44 percent of all
killings globally involve gun violence, and there were over 1 million
firearm-related deaths globally between 2012 and 2016. In contrast,
military expenditure is on the rise. According to [the Stockholm
International Peace Research
Institute](http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/toplist.php) (SIPRI),
[the U.S. continues to be the]{.mark} top [global exporter of
arms]{.mark} and the 13th global importer (with Saudi Arabia holding the
first position), with a [total military
expenditure](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) in 2018 of \$6.5
billion. This is more than 120 times the [U.N.
budget](https://unicwash.org/budget_2018-19/) for the period
2018-2019.]{.underline}**

It is for these reasons that the recent announcement to "revoke" the
U.S. signature of the ATT is so troubling. **[[The world is in]{.mark}
dire [need of]{.mark} an effective [implementation of]{.mark} the only
global [legally binding]{.mark} instrument that regulates the
international [trade in arms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And for that to
happen, **[[it is key to have]{.mark} on board [the largest
exporter]{.mark} in the world, if not as a State Party, at least [as
a]{.mark} responsible [actor committed not to undermine]{.mark} the
object and purpose of [the treaty]{.mark}, [which has]{.mark} at its
core international [peace and security]{.mark} and, most importantly,
the value of the human person]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, this
political decision, based on false premises, and coupled with a
consistent pattern of attacks on multilateral diplomacy, seems anything
but promising.

More than anything else, the ATT regulates the export of weapons. [With
the U.S. currently holding the distinction of being the world's largest
arms exporter, it is in its best interests to accurately identify and
track exactly where its weapons exports are going]{.underline}. The U.S.
has long since understood the importance of this issue, which is why
they have had domestic measures to meet this goal---such as restrictions
on re-transfer of arms sold abroad and end-user checks---in place for
some time. The "boomerang effect," where weapons produced in the U.S.
end up being used against U.S. personnel on the ground, is an important
part of the national security side of this debate. Barbara Frey,
Director of the Human Rights Program at the University of Minnesota and
former Special Rapporteur to the UN Sub-Commission on the issue of
preventing human rights abuses committed with small arms, further points
out that the latest estimates suggest there are currently 650 million
firearms in civilian possession, including 2-10 million in the hands of
gangs, and 1.1-1.8 million more in the possession of non-state armed
groups. 6 ["It really matters what governments do with their weapons,\"
says Frey. Accordingly, the emphasis [the ATT places]{.mark} on
[cooperation between nations]{.mark} who have ratified the treaty
[will]{.mark} help [eliminate gray areas]{.mark} that arise from export
destinations that may present risk]{.underline}. [The ATT calls for
information sharing on things like international trafficking routes,
illicit brokers, and methods of concealment. 7 [In ratifying the
ATT]{.mark} and solidifying this commitment for the international
community, [the U.S. would]{.mark} not only increase the group's
capacity to collect this important information, but also [strengthen
its]{.mark} own argument and [ability to **draw** ]{.mark}**other
hesitant [nations such as China and Russia into compliance with the
treaty]{.mark}**.]{.underline} With today's ever-changing geopolitical
situation[, [the flow of arms from China]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
Pakistan (accounting for 55% of Chinese arms exports), Myanmar, or
Venezuela is something that, if left unregulated by an international
mechanism, **[represents a]{.mark} real [cost to U.S.]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}.** 8 Without ratifying the document itself, the U.S.
will fall short in its argument with fellow large-scale arms export
States whose interests do not always align with its own.]{.underline}
The transparency provided by mandatory national records on arms exports,
stipulated in Article 12 of the ATT, is an invaluable asset to the
international community, requiring those who join the treaty to take
responsibility for arms leaving their territory. 9 Globalization has
changed the way the world interacts and conducts exchange. In
particular, the developing States' interactions 7 and exchanges with
developed States have been slow or resistant to regulation largely due
to rampant corruption in the developing world. [[The]{.mark}
[U.S.]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [set]{.mark} the gold [standard]{.mark} when
it comes to keeping and reporting export data with or [without]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [ATT]{.mark}, but there are many nations around the world
who do not do [so]{.mark}, [nations]{.mark} that [won't]{.mark} even
[discuss]{.mark} [joining]{.mark} the treaty [until]{.mark}
[movement]{.mark} on the issue [is]{.mark} [seen]{.mark} from the United
States. [If the U.S. joins]{.mark} and strengthens the regulatory group
that will emerge when the treaty comes into force, then the opportunity
to [help]{.mark} quell violence in a variety of hot spots around the
world, from the Middle East to Central Africa[, increases
significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reality is that today there can
be no global norm without the participation of the U.S. and the
legitimacy that comes with that participation[. U.S.
[ratification]{.mark} will not attract every country in the world, but
there [will]{.mark} undoubtedly [be]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [domino]{.mark}
[effect]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the strength of this treaty comes from the
transparency these States then must provide on their arms sales. If the
U.S. is looking to [maintain]{.mark} its ability to oversee and
appropriately punish countries for illicit activity through
[international]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark} such as the UN, it cannot
turn its back on one of the mechanisms it helped this body create to
regulate such activity]{.underline}. The ATT is not unique as a treaty
with arms control goals that the United States has not ratified. For
example, the domestic political fight over ratifying the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), another treaty with broad global
support, is still being fought in the U.S. However, a better example of
the world coming together to create an international mechanism already
paying dividends is the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Since its
inception in April 1997, the norms created by the CWC have led to a
marked decrease in the production and proliferation of chemical weapons
around the world, including the ongoing removal of chemical weapons from
Syria. The outcome and goals of the CWC are different from the basic
regulation of arms sales that the ATT seeks, but it nonetheless is an
example of the international community, including full participation of
and ratification by the United States, working collaboratively to create
a mechanism and universal norms by which States around the world operate
to increase collective security. These types of victories for that
collective security can undoubtedly be placed in the "pro" section of
the ATT debate.

https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#full

**[The Case for a New Approach]{.underline}**

So far we have argued that **[arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences]{.underline}**. **[These [factors]{.mark}]{.underline}**
alone **[[argue for]{.mark} significantly [curtailing the arms
trade.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But the case for doing so is made even
stronger by the fact that greatly reducing arms sales would also produce
two significant benefits for the United States that cannot otherwise be
enjoyed.

**[The first benefit from [reducing]{.mark} arms [sales]{.mark} [would
be greater diplomatic]{.mark} flexibility and
[leverage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Critics might argue that even if arms
sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will eliminate a
potential source of leverage. We argue that, on the contrary, **[the
[diplomatic]{.mark} [gains]{.mark} from forgoing arms sales [will
outweigh]{.mark} the potential leverage or other [benefits from]{.mark}
arms [sales]{.mark}. Most importantly, by refraining from arming nations
engaged in conflict, the United States will have the diplomatic
flexibility to engage with all parties as an honest
broker]{.underline}**. **[The inherent difficulty of negotiating while
arming one side is obvious today with respect to North and South Korea.
After decades of U.S. support for South Korea, North Korea clearly does
not trust the United States. Similarly, U.S[.]{.mark} [attempts
to]{.mark} help [negotiate]{.mark} a [peace]{.mark} deal between the
Israelis and Palestinians [have]{.mark} long [been]{.mark}
[complicated]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [American]{.mark} support for
Israel.]{.underline}** To stop arming one side of a contentious
relationship is not to suggest that the United States does not have a
preferred outcome in such cases. **[Rather, by [staying]{.mark}
[out]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the military domain the United States can more
readily encourage [dialogue and diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest. In the case of
Taiwan, for example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase
weapons from other countries to provide for its defense, those weapons
do not have to be made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from
other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China tensions. Even if Taiwan's
defenses remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in
which American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on
Taiwan's behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.-China
diplomacy in general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific
region. Most important, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the
likelihood of the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict
between Taiwan and China.

[T**[he second major benefit]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of reducing arms
sales [is]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [it]{.mark} [would]{.mark}
[imbue]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [with]{.mark}
[greater]{.mark} [moral]{.mark} [authority]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Today, as the leading arms-dealing nation in the world, **[[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [lacks]{.mark} [credibility]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} discussions of [arms]{.mark} [control]{.mark} and
nonproliferation]{.underline}**, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001. **[By showing the world that it is ready to
choose [diplomacy]{.mark} over the arms trade, the United States
[would]{.mark} [provide a huge boost to international efforts]{.mark} to
curtail proliferation and its negative consequences. This is important
because the United States has pursued and will continue to pursue a wide
range of arms control and nonproliferation objectives]{.underline}**.

UNITED NATIONS, Apr 29 2019 (IPS) - **[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[dropped a political
bombshell when]{.underline}** President Donald **[[Trump
announced]{.mark} his administration would [withdraw from the]{.mark}
historic Arms Trade Treaty ([ATT]{.mark})]{.underline}** which the
former Obama administration signed in September 2013.

"We are taking our signature back", said Trump April 26, addressing a
meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA), one of the most
powerful gun lobbies in the US.

**[[The US]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in effect,
**[[joins]{.underline}]{.mark}** three **[other "[rogue
states]{.mark}"]{.underline}** **[-- North Korea, Iran and Syria -- [who
voted against the treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the UN General
Assembly back in April 2013, **[along with 23 countries that abstained
on the voting, [including China, Russia, India]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.

Jayantha Dhanapala, a former UN Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament
Affairs and ex-President of the Pugwash, told IPS that President
**[Trump]{.underline}** "**[continues to create mayhem in the field of
disarmament by wrecking the legal regime]{.underline}** created by the
international community at the behest of vested interests in the gun
lobby sacrificing the humanitarian norms of the world to which the US
has contributed."

The US, which has increasingly shown virtual contempt for
multilateralism, has already scuttled the 2015 multilateral nuclear
agreement with Iran, refused to participate in the global migration
compact, pulled out of the 2015 Paris climate change agreement,
abandoned the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, and
revoked the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.

Dr. Natalie J. Goldring, a Senior Fellow and Adjunct Full Professor with
the Security Studies Program in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign
Service at Georgetown University, told IPS President Trump is pandering
to the National Rifle Association yet again.

She said his announcement that the United States is "un-signing" the
Arms Trade Treaty is yet another example of this administration's
abdication of responsibility in the arms control sphere.

In the fact sheet announcing this decision, the Trump Administration
stated, "The ATT is simply not needed for the United States to engage in
responsible arms trade."

"The Trump Administration has not been engaged in responsible arms trade
in any way, shape, or form. There is indisputable evidence that Saudi
Arabia, for example, consistently violates international human rights
and humanitarian law".

"But the Trump Administration continues to pursue arms sales agreements
with the Saudi regime," said Dr Goldring, who is also a Visiting
Professor of the Practice in the Duke University Washington DC program.

She pointed out that the United States is the world's largest arms
dealer. It's long past time for the United States to show leadership on
the global arms trade, rather than merely treating arms sales as
economic transactions, she added.

The ATT, which was adopted by the United Nations in April 2013 and
entered into force in December 2014, was initiated by the UK, a NATO
ally of the US.

As of last week, the Treaty has 101 States Parties with ratifications,
and 34 countries are signatories but not States Parties.

Responding to questions at a press briefing April 26, UN spokesperson
Stephane Dujarric told reporters that the Arms Trade Treaty is the only
global instrument aimed at improving transparency and accountability in
the international arms trade.

"It is a landmark achievement in the efforts to ensure responsibility in
international arms transfers. This is particularly important in present
times, when we witness growing international tensions and renewed
interest in expanding and modernizing arsenals," he added.

Rachel Stohl, Managing Director at the Stimson Center and a consultant
who helped draft the text of the treaty, said that President
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** has "once again **[[walked away from
America's leadership role]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the world **[[and
undermined]{.mark} international [efforts to reduce]{.mark} human
[suffering]{.mark} caused by]{.underline}** irresponsible and **[illegal
arms transfers]{.underline}**".

In statement released here, Stohl said "Un-signing the Arms Trade Treaty
will undermine international peace and security, increase irresponsible
and illegal sales of conventional weapons, and harm the American
economy".

**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}** transparent,
**[[responsible]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[arms [trade]{.mark}
fundamentally [serves U.S. national security]{.mark}, promotes U.S.
[foreign policy objectives, and]{.mark} supports American
[values]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The ATT facilitates transparency and accountability in a global arms
trade worth nearly \$90 billion a year, building confidence among
governments and ending decades of impunity, she declared.

Dr Goldring said **[[the US]{.underline}]{.mark}** government
**[regularly claims to have the strongest global
standards]{.underline}** for arms transfers. Yet **[it [seeks to abandon
the only legally binding treaty that addresses these
issues.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

"**[This]{.underline}** **[may seem like [a symbolic
step]{.mark}]{.underline}**, because the Trump Administration had
already made clear its lack of support for the treaty," she added.

[But this act [has substantive implications]{.mark} as
well.]{.underline}

**[[It's in the US interest]{.mark} to be part of the ATT and [to work
with]{.mark} other [countries]{.mark} to increase their standards for
importing and exporting weapons]{.underline}**, she noted.

'**[[Unsigning' the ATT decreases]{.mark} our [leverage with]{.mark}
these [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. '**[Do as I say, not as I do'
is a cynical and unpersuasive policy approach]{.underline}**," said Dr
Goldring who also represents the Acronym Institute at the United Nations
on conventional weapons and arms trade issues.

Abby Maxman, President of Oxfam America, said **[Trump's decision [to
un-sign]{.mark} the]{.underline}** **[A]{.underline}**rms
**[T]{.underline}**rade **[T]{.underline}**reaty "**[is a]{.underline}**
reckless, **[self-inflicted wound]{.underline}** **[that continues to
demonstrate the Administration's desire to [turn its back on]{.mark}
global [norms]{.mark}, standards [and US
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is one more misguided step to
dismantle the international partnerships that keep us all safe."

Just last week, the Administration held hostage a UN Security Council
resolution to address sexual violence in conflict-- until language about
the need for sexual & reproductive health services was removed.

And, it's no coincidence that this comes on the heels of President
Trump's veto of the Yemen War Powers Resolution and continued military
support for Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen, said Maxman.

President Trump is sending a clear message to civilians caught in the
crossfire: "we don't care."

The United States will now lock arms with Iran, North Korea and Syria as
non-signatories to this historic treaty whose sole purpose is to protect
innocent people from deadly weapons.

"**[The]{.underline}** **[A]{.underline}**rms **[T]{.underline}**rade
**[T]{.underline}**reaty **[was developed]{.underline}** and signed by
the US and others **[to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of those
who]{.underline}** may **[use them to commit genocide, crimes against
humanity and war crimes. The treaty has the power to save millions from
death, rape, assault and displacement.]{.underline}** Each year an
estimated 500,000 people are killed as a result of the unregulated and
under-regulated arms trade," said Maxman.

#### Treaty ratification encourages the arms trade industry to become more honest and clearer --reduces illegal arms trade that undermines US arms sales and world peace

[[The ATT makes the]{.mark} international arms [trade **safer**]{.mark}
**[and]{.mark} more responsible**. It **[requires governments]{.mark},
[before]{.mark} [granting an export license for weapons]{.mark},**
[to]{.mark} [consider whether]{.mark} [weapons could]{.mark} [be]{.mark}
[used]{.mark} [for genocide or human rights violations**, as well as the
likelihood that the weapons would be diverted**]{.mark} **into the wrong
hands [and]{.mark} [fuel]{.mark} [civil conflict or]{.mark}
[criminal]{.mark} [activity]{.mark}.** [It **provides
mechanisms**]{.mark} **for governments [to]{.mark} [cooperate]{.mark}**
and a means [for greater transparency]{.mark} [over]{.mark} a
[murky]{.mark} [trade]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [contributes]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} devastating [human]{.mark} [suffering]{.mark} --- including
casualties to American service members and civilians --- [in]{.mark}
conflicts in places like [Syria]{.mark}, [Yemen]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[Libya]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This treaty reflects U.S. values and priorities. Throughout the
negotiations, we, as the U.N. consultant and the U.S. government team,
met regularly with interested defense industry and nongovernmental
organizations, briefing simultaneously defense exporters, human rights
advocates]{.underline} and Second Amendment advocates [of how **the ATT
furthered U.S. interests**.]{.underline}

#### Wide implementation of the ATT is key to reduce illicit arms trade -- former UN action proves

Clara [**Ganslandt 13**, EU delegate at the 2013 UN convention, "EU
Statement," 10/28/13,
http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/1com/1com13/statements/28Oct_EU.pdf]{.underline}

We have seen how the [[illicit]{.mark} and poorly-regulated [trade in
arms can create instability and exacerbate conflicts]{.mark},
atrocities, and violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law. [The ATT is the first treaty that addresses these
risks]{.mark} at a global level, by establishing clear and legally
binding criteria,]{.underline} inter alia [with regard to international
human rights law and international humanitarian law. [It]{.mark} also
[recognizes the link between]{.mark} gender based [violence and the
illicit]{.mark} or poorly-regulated international arms
trade.]{.underline}

[[When]{.mark} effectively and [widely implemented]{.mark}, [the ATT
will contribute to more responsible]{.mark} and transparent
[international arms transfers]{.mark} and help eradicate illicit trade.
[By]{.mark} signing and [ratifying]{.mark} the Treaty, [States]{.mark}
can [sustain]{.mark} the international [momentum generated by the
ATT]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} EU Member States are playing their
part: they are all signatories of the Treaty and national ratification
procedures are either complete or well under way. Let me use this
opportunity to warmly welcome the new signatures (29 alone in the month
of September) and ratifications registered so far and to call on all
other States who have not yet done so, to become signatories of the
Treaty.

[For the Treaty to be effective, it needs to be implemented globally and
effectively]{.underline}. The EU, for its part, intends to contribute to
addressing those challenges including through a new Council Decision
expected to be adopted before the end of the year, which will enlarge
the EU assistance portfolio by funding inter alia national
implementation assistance programmes and regional awareness-raising
seminars.

Mr. Chairman,

[Twelve years after the adoption of [the UN P]{.mark}rogramme
[o]{.mark}f [A]{.mark}ction (PoA) on small arms and light weapons
(SALW), [the EU]{.mark} continues to [consider]{.mark} [this]{.mark}
politically binding international [instrument as a key]{.mark} universal
[tool to respond to]{.mark} the challenges posed by the [illicit
trade]{.mark} and excessive accumulation of SALW at national, regional,
and global levels.]{.underline} The EU is very pleased that the 2012
Review Conference agreed on a substantive Outcome Document, which
affirms our renewed commitment to the full and effective implementation
of the PoA and provides for concrete measures and steps to achieve this
aim. The EU remains convinced that efforts to better 2 control SALW have
to be intensified in particular in those areas, where significant
obstacles to full implementation persist. [We believe that these areas
are the issue of diversion of SALW, stockpile management, stockpile
security and stockpile destruction, marking and tracing, the integration
of ammunition and the gender perspective, as well as the need to better
address the humanitarian and socio-economic consequences of the illicit
trade in SALW]{.underline}. The potential of technological progress of
the last decade to enhance the effective implementation of the PoA
should be further explored, too. The EU remains strongly committed to
the effective implementation of the International Tracing instrument
which is one of the most important achievement of the PoA on SALW, inter
alia, by the increased exchange of tracing results and information
sharing.

Isolation: The Cost of Non-Ratification," 5/6/14,
<https://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/382719468.pdf>

Economic Costs The global arms trade is big business. A Congressional
Research Service study found that in 2011 the United States exported
\$66.3 billion worth of arms (of \$85.3 billion total throughout the
world, or, 77.7% share of exports worldwide), and has consistently
ranked number one in the world, ahead of Russia, each year since 2003.
13 Given this position and its strict weapons exports regulations, the
U.S. might be reasonably expected to gain the most from a uniform
regulatory standard imposed on the world arms trade. In addition, these
economic costs represent just the surface of the issue, as many further
costs are derived from corruption in the industry as well as the lost
opportunities for socio-economic development caused by armed violence in
nations to which the U.S. is already providing development aid. [One of
the ATT's core principles is ensuring that weapons likely to be used for
violations of international law are never transferred. [Article
7]{.mark} expressly [forbids governments from selling arms if]{.mark}
there is an "overriding risk" of those arms [being used to
provoke]{.mark} regional [instability, commit violations of
human]{.mark} rights or humanitarian law[, hamper efforts to reduce
poverty, commit]{.mark} transnational organized [crime, or]{.mark} to
[support]{.mark} or perpetrate [terrorist]{.mark}
act[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. 14 A 2008 International Action Network on
Small Arms (IANSA) study found that [[African countries]{.mark} alone
[lose \$18 billion in development each year to armed violence, with 95%
of weapons coming from outside the continent.]{.mark}]{.underline} 15
The availability of illicitly-exchanged weapons helps sustain these
conflicts. In 2012, the United States provided \$12 billion in official
development assistance to African nations. 16 [[It is inaccurate to say
that every nation in Africa is riddled with armed violence]{.mark} that
contribute to lost investment opportunities, [but]{.mark} a review of
these figures indicates that a combination of development assistance and
installation of [a UN-led arms regulation standard would be
beneficial]{.mark} to many developing countries in this part of the
world]{.underline}. It could eventually contribute to diminished ODA
needs. In addition, [a U.S. Department of Commerce study estimates that
the **[arms trade]{.mark}** alone **[accounts for nearly 50 per cent of
all corrupt transactions]{.mark}** globally, while the value of arms
traded annually doesn't exceed 1 per cent of global trade.]{.underline}
17 [[These figures illustrate]{.mark} how rampant corruption is in the
international arms trade network and highlight [the need for an
international consensus on regulating it]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rachel
Stohl, Senior Associate with The Stimson Center and Consultant to the UN
ATT process, explains the importance of having a "\[h\]armonization of
standards" in the global arms trade, saying, ["\[w\]hen you know what
the rules of the game are, it makes trade more efficient, \[so\]
harmonization of exports has an economic benefit."]{.underline}18
Stohl's point speaks to the ability of legitimate arms dealers and
governments to work more effectively and efficiently in avoiding the
corruption and other illicit activity in today's arms trade network.
[The ATT will add to the predictability as far as who has arms and who
does not. Building on the U.S. standard, **[the ATT]{.mark}** 10
[**will** not only **save money for global arms exporters**]{.mark} by
making this export standard a universal obligation, [but also make the
process of identifying]{.mark} and labeling [unacceptable
partners]{.mark} for arms trade [easier]{.mark} for those who are party
to the treaty.]{.underline} Given the high standard the U.S. imposes on
itself, [the U.S. would be best suited to further encourage all other
nations to ratify the ATT and submit to these same standards and
obligations in order to level the playing field. States currently
existing outside the treaty enjoy a marginally greater advantage in
relation to the U.S. on arms trade. It's not often that [the business
community and human rights groups have an opportunity to jointly benefit
from a treaty]{.mark}; however, the ATT presents that
opportunity]{.underline}

### SALW not key to stability

#### Illicit SALW prolif leads to massive setbacks and regional development and has allowed for all destabilizing conflict of the century

####  

Since the invention of [SALW]{.underline}, they [have been used in many
wars and conflicts, including between states, but also at sub-national
level. Because of SALW being so easily available, relatively cheap (in
comparison to conventional weapons) and easy to carry or move around, it
has become possible for ordinary people to possess and use SALW
relatively easily. But the **[illicit]{.mark}, uncontrolled
[prolif]{.mark}eration [and misuse of SALW have severe effects on
conflicts, security and human development]{.mark}**, as outlined
below.]{.underline}

Impact on conflict

Earlier wars in the 19th and 20th centuries already involved the use of
rifles, carbines, machine guns and similar weapons, but the range and
frequency at which such weapons have been used in more [[recent conflict
suggests that]{.mark} [modern SALW are]{.mark} both increasing in
numbers and **[becoming more prevalent in armed
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, armed conflicts Sierra
Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda all witnessed
child combatants using small arms with ease[. And since these weapons
are easy to move around -- and given the history of so many armed
conflicts in Africa already -- SALW are already present to a large
degree in many societies.]{.underline}

SALW are used both by government forces (military and police) and by
non-state actors (guerrillas, ethnic militias, self-defence units,
violent criminals etc) engaged in conflicts

against each other or against the state, or in violent criminal
activities[. [Of the 49 armed conflicts since 1990, all but three relied
on SALW as **the only instrument of war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and only
one, the 1991 Persian Gulf War, was dominated by heavy weapons.3
[[Modern small arms]{.underline}]{.mark} -- especially assault rifles
like the Soviet/Russian AK-47 and the US-made M-16 -- [have played an
especially conspicuous role in recent conflicts, [account]{.mark}ing
[for anywhere between **35 and 60 percent of all of the deaths** and
injuries in warfare since 1990]{.mark}.]{.underline}

International Humanitarian Law, "VIOLATING THE ARMS TRADE TREATY", N.D,
https://www.hsfk.de/fileadmin/HSFK/hsfk_publikationen/Spotlight0118.pdf

**[[The armed conflict in Yemen]{.mark} began in 2011]{.underline}**,
when parts of the Yemenite population rose up against President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, who was replaced by Vice-President Abd-Rabbu Mansour
Hadi**[. The conflict escalated after the]{.underline}** Shiite
**[Houthi rebels took control of the capital]{.underline}** Sana'a **[in
2014]{.underline}**. In March 2015 Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia and **[the
Saudi-led coalition of nine Arab countries commenced its military
operations against the Houthi rebels]{.underline}** and forces loyal to
former President Saleh. **[These operations include bombing raids and a
naval blockade in the Gulf of Aden, which [is causing widespread
humanitarian suffering in Yemen]{.mark}. In [this proxy war]{.mark} both
sides in the [conflict have frequently violated international
humanitarian law]{.mark} (IHL]{.underline}**), PRIF Spotlight 1/2018
**[yet continue to receive arms, with the Houthis being supplied by Iran
despite existing targeted UN sanctions]{.underline}**. In the case of
the Saudi-led coalition, **[Western states]{.underline}** -- among them
Germany **[continue to supply Saudi Arabia with weapons and military
equipment. In these cases, [supplying arms contributes to violations of
IHL and violates core norms of the]{.mark} Arms Trade Treaty
([ATT]{.mark})]{.underline}** which came into force at the end of 2014.
Western countries which once lobbied for a strict ATT now pay lip
service to their former efforts. Their practice of arms supply confirms
the suspicions of nonstate parties that the ATT imposes a double
standard and primarily targets importing states which want to have the
arms trade of Western nations regulated. The EU states should uphold the
call of the EU Parliament for imposing an arms embargo against Saudi
Arabia. Germany should follow the lead of the Netherlands and also
unilaterally renounce such arms exports which they have indicated to
exert as part of the outcome of the exploratory talks between CDU/CSU
and SPD.

### A2 \-\-- Chaos non-uq

#### The conflict in Yemen is exacerbated by US arms sales to Saudi Arabia \-\-- UN has declared it the world's worst humanitarian crisis

**[Dorminey]{.underline}**, **[18]{.underline}**, Thrall, associate
professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason
University and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Dorminey, policy

Arms Sales Policy", 3/21/18,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/yemen-shows-why-us-needs-change-its-arms-sales-policy

The resolution was a failure, but senators and **[[policymakers]{.mark}
seeking to make America less complicit in Yemen's humanitarian
crisis]{.underline}** still have another option: they **[[can curtail
the arms deals the U.S. makes with Saudi Arabia, starving the war
machine currently ravaging Yemen]{.mark} and its people]{.underline}**.

And it's not just about Yemen; **[lawmakers should reevaluate the
overall practice of selling arms to foreign nation]{.underline}**s. In
2017 **[the Trump administration doubled down on arms sales, not only
selling more arms abroad than any of his most recent predecessors, but
also promising policy changes to enable a dramatic increase in the
number of weapons sold abroad]{.underline}**.

This approach to arms sales invites negative downstream consequences.
Shockingly, in most recent military interventions, **[U.S. troops have
faced adversaries armed with American-made weapons. [Indeed, U.S. arms
exports tend to fuel conflicts abroad]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[This
is particularly true in the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where
almost every nation has been directly involved in a conflict in the last
five years, and **[whose nations account for 49 percent of total
American exports over that same period]{.underline}**.

**[Yemen illustrates how [arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline}** can
**[[make]{.mark} a [conflict worse]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2015, the
Obama administration made the decision to provide support to the
Saudi-led intervention in Yemen's civil war. The **[[Saudis]{.mark},
backed by]{.underline}** U.S. logistical aid, **[arms
sales]{.underline}**, and intelligence support, **[[have conducted
thousands of airstrikes against civilian targets]{.mark} including
hospitals, schools, and food production facilities [in violation of the
rules of war]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} war has also generated what
[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations agencies have [call]{.mark}ed [the
world's worst humanitarian crisis]{.mark}, displacing more than two
million Yemenis and killing more than 10,000.]{.underline}**

Instead of working to convince the Saudis to end their horrific
campaign, the administration has continued providing military support
and expanded arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite several members of
Congress raising grave concerns . **[Weapons sold to Saudi Arabia after
the start of hostilities include \$500 million worth of precision-guided
munitions used in the kingdom's air campaign, along with aircraft,
helicopters, tanks, and armored vehicles. Not only does this make [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates complicit in war crimes in Yemen, selling
major [conventional weapons]{.mark} to states actively engaged in a
conflict [prolong those conflicts.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Few nations have large enough arsenals to fight conflicts for
extended periods of time without resupply. This is particularly true of
nations without large domestic defense industries that rely heavily on
arms imports to sustain combat operations.]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia
was the second-largest arms importer worldwide from 2013-17, and
increased its imports 225 percent over the previous five years, partly
in order to fight its war on Yemen.

**[[Risks of entanglement and public opinion blowback on supplier
countries have prompted serious debate]{.underline}]{.mark}** among
European countries **[about the wisdom of arms sales to the Middle
East]{.underline}**. In several cases, the debate led to a halt in sales
to Saudi Arabia and its partners such as the United Arab Emirates.

"Ending US Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,"
<http://uchicagogate.com/articles/2019/4/9/ending-us-arms-sales-saudi-arabia/>

[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[continues to [play a **preeminent role**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in Saudi
weapons acquisitions]{.underline}. [[European
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} have **[[reduced]{.mark} their arms
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in response to Khashoggi's
death]{.underline} while [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates has **[increased sales]{.underline}**. There
are multiple actors in the international game but the US has the biggest
muscles to flex, economically and diplomatically speaking. [**[Nearly
all]{.underline}** [of Saudi Arabia's weapons have American
parts]{.underline}]{.mark} or are maintained by American technicians.
[Saudi Arabia cannot find an easy replacement]{.underline} for its US
weapons imports: [[**it would take decades** for Saudi Arabia to
implement different]{.mark} [systems]{.mark} and the **[transition
costs]{.mark}** of such a switch [would be
**monumental**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[By ending]{.mark} arms
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[can **assert its sway**]{.mark} over
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}: if Saudi weapons and systems are so reliant
on US assistance, perhaps the Saudis should be compelled to comply with
new US terms; Such a move would help change the narrative that the US
will never use its military aid leverage over other countries. If the
United States suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, other major arms
exporters might either take similar measures or continue to follow their
own preexisting scalebacks. **[End Saudi Arms Sales]{.underline}** The
United States' arms sales to Saudi Arabia are flawed in humanitarian,
economic and political terms. Rather than search for innovative ways to
justify protecting arms sales to Saudi Arabia, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates can and [should work
[to]{.mark} legitimately [foster]{.mark} sustainable [peace]{.mark} [and
stability]{.mark} in the Middle East]{.underline}. In short, the United
States ought to reverse its wrongs [by [ending]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[arms [sales]{.mark}]{.underline} [to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. [Doing
so will not only allow war-torn Yemen to]{.underline} begin to
[recover]{.underline}, **[but]{.underline}** [[would]{.mark} also [allow
the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} better revitalize its own economy, and
**[[reassert its]{.mark} military [leverage]{.mark} and international

[[There appears to be significant evidence]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
[Chinese]{.mark} military [transfers]{.mark} to Sudan [have been used
to]{.mark} **[commit violations of human rights]{.mark}** and
international humanitarian law.]{.underline} Amnesty International
reported in June 2006 that Sudanese armed forces and pro-state [militias
used arms delivered from China to Sudan to commit atrocities in southern
Sudan and Darfur.]{.underline}334 In Darfur in 2004, Amnesty
International reported that [military [trucks]{.mark} [were]{.mark}
being [used]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [transport]{.mark} both Sudanese
military and Janjaweed [militia]{.mark} [personnel]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
in some cases to transport [people]{.mark} **[for]{.mark} extrajudicial
[execution]{.mark}**]{.underline}.335 In 2006, a UN panel found that 222
Chinese Dong Feng trucks had been shipped to Sudan.336 Furthermore[,
Chinese-supplied [aircraft]{.mark} [were used to **launch bombing
raids**]{.mark} on villages, conduct reconnaissance prior to attacks and
ferry ground troops.]{.underline}337 A 2006 United Nations panel of
experts on the Sudan crisis has determined that "most ammunition
currently used by parties to the conflict in Darfur is manufactured in
either Sudan or China."[338 Chinese weapons have also been found among
Chadian armed groups that operate in Darfur.]{.underline}339 [China has
continued to allow military equipment to be sent to Sudan
[despite]{.mark} the use of this materiel in the [well]{.mark}
[documented]{.mark} and widespread human rights [violations]{.mark} in
Darfur.]{.underline}

[Not only have Chinese weapons been used to commit human rights
violations in Sudan, but their [transfer]{.mark} to either non-state
actors such as the Janjaweed militia or to Sudanese Armed Forces
operating in Darfur **[is in direct contravention of the UN arms
embargo]{.mark}** on Darfur]{.underline}.340 In 2007 China's Special
Representative to Africa, Ambassador Liu, stated that "We will do out
best to prevent weapons from finding their way into the wrong hands and
from doing the wrong things."341 China reportedly suspended arms
transfers to Sudan for a brief period in 2008.342 However, since then
China has continued to send arms to Khartoum, and in October 2010 China
reportedly attempted to block a report to the UNSC by a Panel of Experts
that showed that Chinese ammunition had been used in Darfur against UN
and African Union Peacekeepers.343 Given that China itself has
peacekeepers in Sudan, the revelation was evidently an awkward one for
Beijing.

#### The ATT can deter Chinese Expansionism in Africa

**[[China]{.mark} has become one of the biggest suppliers of small arms
and light weapons to African states. Africa [will]{.mark} [continue to
be]{.mark} an attractive [market]{.mark} [for]{.mark} China's arms
industry, and for [African states]{.mark} China will remain an
attractive supplier of affordable weapons, [especially]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} those [states]{.mark} [ostracised]{.mark} by other
exporters]{.underline}**. All states have the right to export and import
weapons to meet their legitimate defence and security needs. **[The
problem with Chinese arms exports lies with how some of these weapons
are used]{.underline}** and Conclusion saferworld 55 370 Taylor (2010),
p 127. 371 Ibid, p 128. 372 Ibid, p 127. the hands that they end up in.
The record shows that in several cases **[[Chinese weapons]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} [undermined]{.mark} African [peace and security]{.mark}.
[They have been used to]{.mark} [commit]{.mark} grave
[violations]{.mark} [of]{.mark} human rights and international
[humanitarian]{.mark} [law,]{.mark} they have ended up arming non-state
groups [and]{.mark} they have [fuelled]{.mark}
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China's arms transfer policy states
that arms can only be used for the legitimate self-defence of states.
Yet [in several African countries China is dealing [with]{.mark}
so-called '[legitimate']{.mark} [governments]{.mark}]{.underline} that
in fact "are little more than glorified kleptocracies and quasi-states
whose principal aim is ensuring the survival and enrichment of the
elite."370 [In such cases, state security usually means regime security,
which has little to do with safeguarding the security of the state's
citizens.]{.underline}371

It is clear that **[Chinese [export]{.mark} controls [are]{.mark} either
insufficient themselves or have been too [weakly]{.mark}
[enforced]{.mark} to prevent the misuse of Chinese
weapons.]{.underline}** Additionally, **[[transparency]{.mark}
[issues]{.mark} related to the arms trade [risk]{.mark} undermining the
positive benefits of China's [transition]{.mark} to a law-based
system]{.underline}** from an ad hoc administrative system of arms
export controls, fuelling the suspicions that surround China's arms
exports.

The degree of control which some officials in Beijing -- such as those
involved in providing export licences or those in the MFA -- have over
the decisions and actions of Chinese state-owned but
commercially-orientated companies that export arms to Africa is somewhat
questionable. The case of the 'ship of shame' to Zimbabwe perhaps
illustrates this best. [It is doubtful whether MFA officials or
regulators have the political clout to turn down requests for export
licences and fully enforce regulations which are already purposefully
weak and ambiguous.]{.underline}372 In this regard, the problems
associated with [Chinese [arms]{.mark} are clearly not simply the
outcome of technical failures associated with weak export controls;
**they also [reflect]{.mark} the [failure of political actors]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} prioritise the issue and [take]{.mark} [seriously the
harm]{.mark} that is being caused.]{.underline}

Some scholars and even officials in China admit that [Chinese arms
transfers are problematic for African security, and in some cases make
conflicts worse and fuel violence]{.underline}. Such assessments will
undoubtedly come to gain traction and be more influential over policy in
the long term. Furthermore, [[China]{.mark} does not want to operate in
an international atmosphere of permanent suspicion and condemnation. It
is keen to be seen as both **a champion of developing countries' rights
and interests**, [and]{.mark} responsible leading power]{.underline}, as
demonstrated by its more cautious actions in the run-up to the Beijing
Olympics in 2008.

It is important not to lose sight of the fact that **[China is hardly
alone in transferring arms that eventually are used in African
conflicts. [Western]{.mark} [countries]{.mark} [have]{.mark}
[inundated]{.mark} [Africa]{.mark} with small arms, tanks and fighter
aircraft, thereby fuelling wars, [propping]{.mark} [up]{.mark} dictators
and even arming the perpetrators of the genocide in
Rwanda.]{.underline}** While Chinese military support for the regimes in
Sudan and Zimbabwe is much condemned in the West, direct and indirect
arms transfers to countries of concern by Western arms exporters do not
always attract the same level of criticism.

[This does not excuse China's [wrongful]{.mark} [practices]{.mark} in
Africa, especially as arms transfers are concerned. However, any
critical engagement with China needs to reflect a better and more
nuanced understanding of the culpability of all
stakeholders.]{.underline} Solutions to African peace and security
threats are to be found within the continent itself, in the hands of
governments, politicians and civil society. [External actors, who have a
shared interest in stability in Africa, **must find ways to co-operate
with one another** in order to support peace and ensure their actions do
not fuel or worsen conflicts. [Collectively]{.mark} [preventing
irresponsible arms transfers will be a significant step in the right
direction.]{.mark} **[The]{.mark} Arms Trade Treaty** ([ATT]{.mark})
discussions at the UN **[present a real opportunity to take this
step.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

## Latin America

### A2 \-\-- no inherency

#### Trump plans to shuffle the agencies in charge of gun exports in the US\-\--this furthers enables human rights abuses from countries the US sells to.

On April 26th, President **[[Trump signed an executive
order]{.underline}]{.mark}** meant **[[to withdraw
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited

**[R]{.underline}**ifle **[A]{.underline}**ssociation
**[speech]{.underline}**, throwing his pen into the crowd afterwards to
great applause and **[proclaiming]{.underline}** that **[he was acting
to protect America's sovereignty and Second Amendment
rights.]{.underline}**

**[Although]{.underline}** President **[[Trump's]{.mark} speech to the
NRA was]{.underline}** obviously meant to be **[flashy]{.underline}**
and dramatic, **[this [move has been a long time
coming]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In January, **[[the administration told
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[they intended to finalize rules
to shuffle which agency oversees consumer gun
exports]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and]{.underline}**, in the process, to
**[relax export regulations]{.underline}** and oversight.
**[[This]{.mark} rule]{.underline}** change **[[placed the Department of
Commerce]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[which has a far simpler process for
approving international arms sales than does the State
Department]{.underline}** and which does not even charge a fee for the
process, **[[wholly in charge of]{.mark} the [verification]{.mark} of
international arms sales]{.underline}**. Further, **[under new rules,
Congress does not have to be notified of arms deals in advance of their
occurrence. This is worrying]{.underline}**, **[because Congress has
acted multiple times]{.underline}** previously **[to block arms sales
over human rights concerns.]{.underline}** These moves have been widely
criticized because, **[while [the State Department has the existing
framework and personnel to vet arms exports]{.mark}]{.underline}** on
human rights and security grounds, **[[the Commerce Department does
not]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As such, **[the potential for human rights
abuses arising from US international arms sales will]{.underline}**
almost **[certainly increase dramatically.]{.underline}**

### A2 \-\-- no impact to small arms

#### Diverted weapons in Latin America prop up criminal organizations. 

**[Mack 18]{.underline}** (Daniel Mack, independent consultant working
on issues of armed violence reduction and international arms control,
December 2018, "How to use the Arms Trade Treaty to Address Diversion in
Latin America ", UNSCAR,

**\*SALW = Small arms and light weapons**

**[Heavy weapons like tanks]{.underline}** and combat aircraft **[are
difficult to divert]{.underline}**. **[[In the absence of
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** or armed insurgency**[,
[firearms]{.mark} are mainly [of interest for criminal
organizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Conversely, **[[diversion of SALW
is much more pervasive]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly **[[given
their concealability]{.mark} and portability,]{.underline}** **[and
"their wide distribution throughout security force
stockpiles".]{.underline}**38 According to Small Arms Survey, "**[while
larger conventional arms]{.underline}**, **[such as artillery and
missile systems, are rarely deployed to smaller units of a country's
security forces]{.underline}**, **[small arms and light weapons feature
in all levels of the national stockpile]{.underline}** (which)
**[results in a greater number of potential opportunities for
diversion]{.underline}**".**[39 [This has]{.mark} certainly
[proven]{.mark} to be [the case in Latin America, as diversion,]{.mark}
particularly [from police forces and military
stockpiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**, is common.

The **[trade in small arms is relevant to more countries than that of
heavy weapons]{.underline}**. For example, of **[the ATT annual
reports]{.underline}** submitted by States Parties in 2016 on their arms
exports and imports that took place in 2015 **[included 13 'nil' reports
for exports and imports of heavy weapons, but only two 'nil' reports for
exports and imports of SALW]{.underline}**.40 **[In Latin America,
while]{.underline}** several **[countries may not]{.underline}**
actively **[participate in the trade of heavy weapons]{.underline}**,
**[many are actors in the small arms market]{.underline}**. For example,
in 2016 Paraguay did not report any imports of major weapons, but it
reported the import of 8,020 semi-automatic pistols and 89 revolvers, as
well as of 3,926 rifles and carbines. For the same year, El Salvador
reported the import of two largecaliber artillery systems and of 25,268
SALW items.41

Transparency regarding the international transfer of small arms is on
average lower than for larger conventional systems. For example, in its
2016 ATT annual report, Argentina provided descriptions of major
conventional weapons it imported in 2016 but did not provide any
descriptions for its exports or its imports of SALW.42 **[While "easily
dismissed as 'lesser' weapons in a trade in which units of major weapon
systems can cost millions and include cutting-edge technology, [a few
relatively cheap guns can wreak major havoc.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A
**[[few thousand dollars']{.mark} worth [of firearms]{.mark} or grenades
[can facilitate tragedies on the scale of the attacks on Kenya's Garissa
University]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and the
World Cup strike in Kampala".43

Even within the category of SALW, **[ATT]{.underline}** Academy
**[participants noted the primacy of small arms vis-à-vis light weapons
in the context of diversion and human security impact in Latin
America]{.underline}**. According to a United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime (UNDOC) report on Transnational Organized Crime in Central
America and the Caribbean, "**[assault rifles are not a big feature of
urban crime]{.underline}** - **[[handguns are]{.mark} more concealable,
easier to use in close quarters, and [just as effective for almo st
every criminal]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[task]{.underline}**]{.mark}".44 This is evident in cases like
Guatemala where between 2008 and 2011, up to 5,000 firearms were seized
each year, of which up to 60 percent were pistols and only 4 percent
were assault rifles, as well as in Honduras where in 2011, 41 percent of
seized firearms were pistols, 30 percent revolvers, 8 percent shotguns
and only 4 percent assault rifles.45

#### Ammunition perpetuates conflicts in Latin America\-\--they're the sine qua non to causing violence.

**[Bleinroth 18]{.underline}** (Marcus Bleinroth, Director of Division,
Conventional Disarmament, Arms Control and CSBM, Preventive Arms
Control, 2018, "AMMUNITION CONTROL PRACTICES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE
CARIBBEAN", UNLIREC,
http://www.unlirec.org/Documents/Amm_Contro_Practices.pdf, accessed

Introduction The Importance of Ammunition Controls PART I "What is a gun
without any bullets?"1 "**[[Stop a bullet, stop a
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**."2 "The indispensable complement to any
weapon",3 "the fuel of conflict",4 "the oxygen of armed violence".
"People don't die of gun wounds, they die of bullet wounds."5
"**[[Ammunition transforms]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[Small Arms and Light
Weapons\] **[from inoperative objects into lethal weapons that can be
used to take away human lives and devastate
communities]{.underline}**."6 "Once they enter the body, they fragment
and explode, pulverizing bones, tearing blood vessels and liquefying
organs."7

**[Much has been]{.underline}** rightfully written **[about the
essential role [ammunition]{.mark} plays in "escalating,
[prolong]{.mark}ing, [and intensify]{.mark}ing [armed conflict and
crim]{.mark}]{.underline}**[e]{.mark},"8 **[not the least because
"weapons often last for decades,]{.underline}** but ammunition can only
be used once".9 **[[In some regions, a lack of ammunition supply "has
brought]{.mark} about [the neardisappearance of certain]{.mark} types of
[weapon", such as]{.mark} the case of [the G3 assault rifle in East
Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}**.10 **[Once diverted from the legal market,
"it is]{.underline}** arguably more **[important to understand
trafficking in small arms ammunition than it is trafficking in small
arms and light weapons, because [maintaining a regular supply of
ammunition is crucial to sustaining conflict and armed criminal
activity]{.mark}]{.underline}**."11

**[In Latin America and the Caribbean, [constant supply]{.mark},
availability and proliferation of ammunition to all potential actors of
violence]{.underline}** -- **[[either through use in criminal activity,
misuse by State forces, interpersonal violence between
civilians,]{.mark} or incidents with private security
forces]{.underline}** [-- **[are a sine qua non to producing the
region's]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[macabre [armed violence]{.mark}
records]{.underline}**. If indeed "**[firearms are more frequently used
in homicides in Latin America]{.underline}** and the Caribbean than
elsewhere in the world,"12 the same can be said of bullets. Semantics,
perhaps, but these daily human tragedies are not only "firearmrelated
homicides" but also, essentially, "ammunition-related homicides" and
must be treated as such if seeking policies to diminish the body count.

Indeed, **[ammunition]{.underline}** "arguably **[constitutes the most
lethal part of any weapon system]{.underline}**".13 In isolation,
**[ammunition is]{.underline}** certainly **[more dangerous than the
firearms]{.underline}** it renders lethal, given the risks of explosive
accidents, the so-called unplanned explosions at munitions sites (UEMS),
even if these are most likely in depots with ammunition for light
weapons or military-grade explosives, than when storing small arms
ammunition -- the focus of this report -- alone.

### A2 \-\-- ATT doesn't solve Latin America

#### The ATT stops the sale of illicit ammunition in conflict regions.

**[[The ATT will prevent the irresponsible sale]{.underline}]{.mark}**,

1.4.2 **[[The Illicit Arms Trade Latin America is a strategic region for
the control]{.mark} of the traffic [of arms]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** other **[forms of organized crime]{.underline}**
**[[due to]{.mark} its [recent]{.mark} history with [armed conflicts,
because it is a transit zone]{.mark} for]{.underline}** various types of
**[smuggling, due to its high levels of socio-economic
inequality]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[because it has a weak
institutional system that raises a certain degree of
uncertainty]{.underline}** **[in its capacity to properly enforce
the]{.underline}** law and to exercise transparent judiciary processes.

**[The trafficking of [small arms]{.mark} and light weapons [is one of
the least profitable transnational crimes, but it
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[one of the most consequential for
human security]{.mark} in developing countries.]{.underline}** This
market was worth US\$1.7 billion to \$3.5 billion in 2014, which
represents 10 to 20 percent of the legal arms trade. **[Three main
factors drive prices: an area's level of conflict, political unrest, and
political tension]{.underline}**; **[the distance over which the items
are smuggled]{.underline}**; **[and, the levels of enforcement
traffickers must overcome.]{.underline}** Internet-based trafficking
represents a growing challenge to combatting weapons smuggling.
**[Decommissioned weapons that had been sold and then illegally
reactivated were used in several recent terrorist attacks in Western
Europe and represent another trending threat of arms
trafficking.]{.underline}**

**[Regarding]{.underline}** to illegal **[sales routes in South
America]{.underline}**, **[[the final destination
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** most [**[often Colombia]{.underline}**, **[as
it is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[home to [the largest]{.mark} number of
[buyer]{.mark}s [of arms]{.mark}]{.underline}** and ammunition, as well
as being a major supplier of cocaine - often used by paramilitary and
guerrilla organizations as a currency of exchange and payment. The main
points of entry and exit of cargoes trafficked in Brazil are the borders
with Paraguay and Bolivia.

It is known that **[[the Amazon]{.mark} region [is the
cradle]{.mark}]{.underline}** or route **[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}**
numerous **[[illicit activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as drug
trafficking, arms and ammunition, biopiracy, illegal logging, and
organized crime and money laundering, among others. The presence of
Colombian guerrillas and drug traffickers, who run airstrips,
laboratories, and maintain smuggling routes and distribution centers
within the forest (LOPES, 2009, p. 94), **[undoubtedly contribute to
making border protection even more difficult]{.underline}** and for the
proliferation of other related illicit actions.

The [**[arms]{.underline}** **[trafficking]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[carried out in the Amazon region]{.underline}**, having as its main
destination the illegal armed groups, **[[happens through several
shipments]{.mark} containing small amount of arms.]{.underline}**
**[[All means]{.mark} of transportation [are
available]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with a wide variety of routes and
entry points. The **[Amazon rainforest is characterized by the scarce
presence of the States, due to the difficulties mentioned
above.]{.underline}** **[Colombia]{.underline}** also **[suffers from
the lack of technical and human resources, which prevents it from
maintaining permanent and effective surveillance]{.underline}** across
most of its borders (UNODC, 2006).

**[The Amazonian countries]{.underline}**, bordering Colombia,
**[are]{.underline}** more than **[great suppliers of arms to the
Colombian irregular groups]{.underline}**, **[they]{.underline}** are
**[transit territory for the armament originating from other parts of
the world]{.underline}** - and often supply with Colombian illegal armed
groups. The extensive, increasingly porous frontiers are easy targets
for traffickers, who find themselves in an inhospitable environment,
virtually without state control and largely made up of indigenous
groups.

**[Most illegal weapons enter Colombia by land across
borders]{.underline}**; followed by maritime transport, mainly using
Panama as a gateway; and, thirdly, the fluvial and aerial means are
used - through the Amazonian borders and inaccessible to conventional
vehicles, as is the case of the Brazilian border. **[Another means of
transport used is \"human couriers\".]{.underline}** **[Colombian armed
groups prefer to use the airway on the Amazon border because of the
large deficiencies in radar coverage]{.underline}**, which facilitate
the entry of traffickers into Colombian territory, especially if
airplanes fly at low altitudes (UNODC, 2006).

**[In]{.underline}** **[Brazil, the Federal Police identified four main
routes of arms trafficking]{.underline}** in the Amazon region: **[(1)
armaments leave the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, **[through Panama]{.underline}** and Brazil,
to be later exchanged for drugs in Colombia; **[(2) the weapons come
from the USA, through Mexico]{.underline}** and Paraguay, to Brazil;
**[(3) US armaments pass through Mexico]{.underline}** and enter Brazil
through ports (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo) and Rio de Janeiro airport;
**[(4) European weapons leave Rotterdam]{.underline}**, the Netherlands,
enter Suriname, pass through Brazil and are delivered to Colombia.

### A2 \-\-- No impact to refugees

#### Trump will increase troops to the Southern border in response to migrants\-\--this weakens our ongoing great power competition. 

**[Burns 18]{.underline}** (Robert Burns, AP national security reporter;
Lolita C. Bolder, National Security/Pentagon Reporter Associated Press,
11-1-2018, "Border mission doesn\'t fit Jim Mattis\' focus on

WASHINGTON --- Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has left no doubt that his
top priority as leader of the military is making it more "lethal" ---
better at war and more prepared for it --- and yet nothing about the
military's new mission at the U.S.-Mexico border advances that goal.
Some argue it detracts from it.

**[The troops going to the border areas]{.underline}** of Texas, Arizona
and California **[are a small fraction of the military's roughly 1.3
million active-duty members]{.underline}**, and the mission is set to
last only 45 days. **[But [many question the wisdom of drawing]{.mark}
even several [thousand away from training]{.mark} for their key purpose:
to win wars.]{.underline}**

James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral and former head of U.S. Southern
Command, said the **[[troops should be preparing for
combat]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other missions, "**[[not monitoring a
peaceful border]{.underline}]{.mark}**" for the arrival of a migrant
caravan of several thousand people on foot, still about 900 miles away.

"**[It sends a terrible signal to Latin America and the Caribbean as we
unnecessarily militarize our border,"]{.underline}** Stavridis, who also
served as the top NATO commander, said Thursday. "**[It places U.S.
troops who are fundamentally untrained for the mission of border
security]{.underline}** and border enforcement **[into an area of
operations]{.underline}**, which could cause incidents of a negative
character. If we need more border patrol agents, hire them."

The first 100 or so active duty troops arrived at the border on
Thursday, making initial assessment at the McAllen, Texas, crossing.
Overall, there are about 2,600 troops at staging bases in the region.

David Lapan, a retired Marine colonel who is a former spokesman for the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Department of Homeland Security,
said that taking troops away from training and from their families to
play a supporting role in border security is unwise.

"**[It just doesn't make any sense]{.underline}**," said Lapan, now a
vice president of communications at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
"**[This caravan]{.underline}**, this group of poor people, **[including
a lot of women and children]{.underline}**, **[doesn't pose a threat ---
not a national security threat."]{.underline}**

**[In line with [the Pentagon's national security
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[Mattis has been focused on
improving]{.underline}** the **[combat readiness of a military worn down
by the recent years of]{.underline}** **[congressionally imposed budget
cuts]{.underline}** and the grind of 17 years of war in Afghanistan.
**[This [includes reorienting training from]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
required for **[the [smaller wars]{.mark} the U.S. has
fought]{.underline}** since the 9/11 terrorist attacks **[[to a "great
power" struggle with Russia and China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[That
context may explain why th[e Pentagon]{.mark}]{.underline}** itself
**[[seemed]{.mark} caught [off-guard by]{.mark}]{.underline}** President
Donald **[[Trump's]{.mark} abrupt [order to dispatch active-duty
troops]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the Customs and Border Patrol, which
requested Pentagon help, has struggled to define details of the mission
and explain its scope.

"That this is a security threat is preposterous and not supported by the
evidence," said Derek Chollet, former senior policy adviser at the
Pentagon. "**[[If you're]{.underline}]{.mark}** sitting **[in the
Pentagon]{.underline}** **[and worried about]{.underline}**
implementation of the **[national defense strategy]{.underline}** **[and
worried about the threats from China and Russia, this is not at the top
of your list."]{.underline}**

"This is another version of the parade," Chollet said, referring to
Trump's demand earlier this year --- eventually withdrawn --- that the
military spend millions to stage a parade in Washington D.C. "**[[This
is not a good use of U.S. military resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** at
this moment. [**[Trump was frustrated in his effort to build a physical
wall on the border,]{.underline}** **[now he's trying to build a human
wall by using the U.S. military."]{.underline}**]{.mark}

Mattis has rejected assertions that the military is being leveraged by
the White House as a political stunt in advance of the midterm
elections. "We don't do stunts," he said Wednesday, but neither has he
argued that sending thousands of active-duty soldiers to help secure the
border is his preference.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, who as head of U.S. Northern Command is
commanding the military operation, dubbed "Operation Faithful Patriot,"
has argued that the caravan is a potential threat, although he has not
fully defined that.

"I think what we have seen is we've seen clearly an organization at a
higher level than we've seen before," O'Shaughnessy said. "We've seen
violence coming out of the caravan and we've seen as they've passed
other international borders, we've seen them behave in a nature that has
not been what we've seen in the past."

One concern raised by other defense officials is that the caravans are
largely male-dominated, and that one of them used violence when crossing
the border into Mexico. But Associated Press journalists traveling with
the largest group say it includes many families, including hundreds of
children, and it has been orderly and peaceful, with no sign of any
danger.

**[The military says it is deploying 7,000]{.underline}** troops to
Texas, Arizona and California, and **[while it has left open the
possibility that the number could grow by another thousand under current
plans, the scope of the mission has grown in recent days.]{.underline}**
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he would send as many as
15,000 troops.

Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said in a letter to Trump on Thursday that his administration
has given the committee no evidence that migrant caravans pose a direct
security threat to the U.S.

"**[This is not a military problem; [it does not warrant a military
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Reed wrote. He said **[the
administration should disclose the cost of the military's border
mission]{.underline}** "**[and [what impacts it will have on military
readiness]{.mark} and the overall budget."]{.underline}**

With his eyes squarely on Tuesday's election contests, Trump has rushed
a series of immigration declarations, promises and actions as he tries
to mobilize supporters to retain Republican control of Congress. His own
campaign in 2016 concentrated on border fears, and that's his focus in
the final days of the midterm fight.

Trump has railed against illegal immigration, focusing on the migrant
caravans that have been going on for several years but received little
attention until now. The largest at the moment consists of about 4,000,
down from a high of about 7,000, and is still in southern Mexico.
Several smaller groups, estimated at a combined 1,200 people, are
farther away.

## Somali Piracy

#### Somali piracy wrecks global trade

La\'Nita M. **[Johnson 14]{.underline}**, Graduate Program Coordinator,
International Training and Education Program at American University,
"The Consequences of Somali Piracy on International Trade" 1/1/14,
https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&context=globaltides

The [**[maritime piracy]{.mark} attacks that transpire [off the
H]{.mark}orn [o]{.mark}f [A]{.mark}frica [are severely disrupting
international trade]{.mark}**. [The Far East-Europe route is]{.mark} one
of [the world's]{.mark} [most active]{.mark} transcontinental [maritime
route]{.mark}s, [as]{.mark} it receives nearly 20 percent of all global
trading activities and [more than 80 percent of trade moves through the
Gulf of Aden]{.mark}.]{.underline} More specifically, more than 20,000
ships carrying most of the world's affordable clothing, crude oil, and
dry commodities pass through this route annually.22 However, on this
route, [there is an important barrier by the Puntland area in northeast
Somalia. As self-ruling clans and warlords govern that unstable region,
the adjacent Gulf of Aden harbors copious amounts of Somali
pirates.]{.underline} Their main goals are to hijack ships and seize the
transported goods, holding them until companies pay the ransom in order
to retrieve their cargo and crewmembers. Consequently, [[this
route]{.mark} adequately [reflects]{.mark} the [significant impacts of
maritime piracy on global shipping]{.mark} and world
development.]{.underline}23

The [financial implications]{.underline} of maritime piracy [are
widespread.]{.underline} With a lack of central government, Somali
pirates exploit their surrounding waters, leaving the cargo frequently
transported between Europe and Asia endangered. One major implication is
that the [attacks have forced major shipping companies to adjust their
routes from the Far East to Europe. For example, many companies are
altering their courses from the Gulf of Aden to the Cape of Good Hope or
the Suez Canal in order to decrease the likelihood of pirate attacks.
Such changes add significant additional costs. Attacks have created
extra costs for fuel and higher insurance premiums, which ultimately
create an additional burden on consumers in the form of higher prices
for their goods.24 It is estimated that [if one-third of the Far-East
European cargo routes were diverted]{.mark} via the Cape of Good Hope,
[it would trigger \$7.5 billion extra in expenses
worldwide]{.mark}.25]{.underline}

The timeliness of shipments and [delayed delivery]{.underline} of
transported cargo is another consequence [that stems from pirate
attacks]{.underline} and the necessity of rerouting vessels.
Unfortunately, the uncertainty of receiving scheduled cargo creates
often [deters companies, thus significantly decreases trade
opportunities.]{.underline} While it is difficult to study the effects
of insecurity, many studies have been done that demonstrate that more
transparency about the measures being used to combat piracy will result
in higher volumes of trade. Ultimately, **[[piracy can significantly
affect the g]{.mark}ross [d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct [of
countries whose trade it disrupts]{.mark}.26]{.underline}**

Through data analysis and empirical application, it was discovered that
[the number of hijackings is the most relevant variable to the economic
effects of piracy. Studies show that each [increase in the number of
attacks indefinitely hinders the amount of exports of a country]{.mark}.
More specifically, these studies found that the effect of an additional
hijacked vessel can decrease a country's exports by about 1.1 percent.
The study found that [trade losses due to piracy attacks between Europe
and Asia total \$24.5 billion in just 2008 alone]{.mark}]{.underline}.27

In an additional study done by the same authors, the percentage of
piracy acts by Somali pirates is compared to incidents involving
Malaccan pirates (competitors of Somali pirates that plague the Strait
of Malacca), specifically on the Europe-East Asia trade route. From 1999
to 2008, there was a clear increase in the amount of Somali hijackings,
juxtaposed to a sharp decline in Malaccan pirate attacks. [Losses in
trade caused by Somali pirates multiplied by six from 1999 to
2008]{.underline}, while the losses caused by Malaccan pirates were
reduced by one-quarter.28

Since 2009, major economic powerhouses have begun deploying naval forces
along the Gulf of Aden in order to protect shipments transported on the
Far East-Europe route. Data demonstrates that the absence of government
intervention is a large factor in the rise of piracy attacks. From 2007
to 2008, piracy incidents rose by seven times, which undeniably could
have been mitigated with better administration involvement. If the
governments had not interfered, total traffic volumes would have reduced
by 30.25 percent, solidifying the theory that maritime piracy in Somalia
is truly affecting global shipping companies' regular activity. While
the affected costs vary, the overall economic welfare loss is
substantially superior, as it entails the losses due to reduction in
traffic volumes and efficiency loss due to using an alternative route.
[Considering that 80 percent of current international trade is
transported by sea, a reduction in these trips can bring shocking
consequences to the global economy]{.underline}.29

Overall, the empirical analysis demonstrated an expected annual loss of
\$30 billion on the various countries that utilize the Gulf of Aden
shipping route. Thus, it is imperative for governments and international
organizations to take up effective measures against modern maritime
piracy, **[as [the economic stakes are extremely pertinent to the health
of the global economy]{.mark}.30]{.underline}**

## Mexico Cartel

#### Illicit arms to Mexico inflame the arms race between cartels and the Mexico military.

**[Lindsay-Poland 15]{.underline}** (John Lindsay-Poland, coordinates a
project to stop U.S. arms to Mexico , 3-18-2015, "How U.S. Guns Sold to

accessed 7-12-2019) wl

**[The Mexican military is the only legal importer of
firearms]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}**to **[Mexico]{.underline}**.
In turn, **[the Mexican army is the only legal distributor of guns
within the country]{.underline}**; **[personal possession]{.underline}**
of firearms **[is highly restricted]{.underline}**, with a single
military-run retail store for gun sales in Mexico City. Aside from the
weapons that the military acquires for its own forces, **[most legally
imported guns in Mexico are sold to state and local]{.underline}**
police **[forces]{.underline}**. **[More than half of the 305,086 guns
sold by the Mexican Secretariat]{.underline}** of National Defense --
which includes the army and air force and is known by its Spanish
acronym SEDENA --- from 2010 through 2016 were sold to police, according
to documents released by SEDENA in response to a public records request.

**[[Since criminal organizations arm]{.mark} themselves [with U.S.
assault weapons illegally]{.mark}]{.underline}** trafficked from the
U.S. retail market, **[[legal exports to]{.underline}]{.mark}** police
and **[[the military are part of a deadly arms
race]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[with these organizations]{.underline}**.
**[More than 20,000 firearms obtained by Mexican state]{.underline}**
and federal police **[went missing]{.underline}** or were
**[stolen]{.underline}** from 2006 to 2017, according to SEDENA data.
More than 7,000 of the weapons went missing from police in Mexico City
and Mexico state. In the state of Guerrero, **[the number of guns gone
missing or stolen]{.underline}** between 2010 and 2016 amounts to nearly
one-fifth of the firearms police acquired in the state during the same
period.

There is also evidence that **[firearms legally imported from
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[have been used in some of the worst human rights violations in
Mexico]{.underline}** in recent years. The local police who attacked the
43 Ayotzinapa students were armed with AR6530 rifles, a model variant of
the AR-15, legally supplied through licensed shipments from Colt,
according to documents in the judicial record.

An investigation by Mexico's National Human Rights Commission found that
Federal Police, who carried out the massacre of 22 persons in Tanhuato,
Michoacán, in 2015, killed five of them with Dillon Aero guns mounted on
Black Hawk helicopters. The Dillon guns fire some 125 rounds per second,
and Mexico obtained 16 of them for the army in 2013, for just over \$1
million, and then another 12 in 2015, according to Mexico's most recent
Arms Trade Treaty report.

in 2007, of which 4.5 million were properly registered with the army.

These are unusual cases, in that we know which weapons were involved.
Most homicides in Mexico --- including those carried out by state forces
--- are never investigated, so there is no judicial record identifying
the firearms that were used. But **[the volume of U.S. firearms going to
Mexico,]{.underline}** **[combined with the [well-established record
of]{.mark} police and [military forces colluding with organized crime
and committing gross human rights violations, means that U.S. guns
are]{.mark} certainly [at the scene of many]{.mark} more
[crimes.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The example of U.S. gun producer Sig Sauer is instructive as to how guns
move from the military to police. **[In]{.underline}** April
**[2015]{.underline}**, **[the U.S. State Department issued a \$266
million license to Sig Sauer]{.underline}**: \$265 million for gun
sales, and \$1 million for other equipment and technical support to the
Mexican navy, defense ministry, interior ministry, and federal and state
police forces. **[That year, Mexico imported 3,060
rifles]{.underline}**, 3,819 pistols, and 505 machines guns produced by
Sig Sauer's New Hampshire production facilities. The license also
permits the Mexican navy to assemble Sig Sauer MPX submachine guns,
capable of firing 850 rounds a minute, from "kits" made of parts
produced by the company. All told, as of January, \$29.3 million in guns
and gun parts had been exported from Sig Sauer and other New Hampshire
manufacturers to Mexico since April 2015, according to Census Bureau
trade records --- meaning that Sig Sauer has at least \$235 million left
in sales to make before its license expires in 2024.

Since 2014, the Mexican military has sold 1,400 U.S.-produced Sig Sauer
firearms to police in 18 Mexican states, including states where there is
an extensive record of collusion with organized crime.

On its end, since 2014, the Mexican military has sold 1,400
U.S.-produced Sig Sauer firearms to police in 18 Mexican states,
including states where there is an extensive record of collusion with
organized crime, such as Tamaulipas, Michoacán, and Chihuahua, SEDENA
records show. **[State authorities]{.underline}** also **[distribute
these weapons to local police]{.underline}**; **[in the state of
Mexi]{.underline}**co, for example**[, Sig Sauer weapons were sold to
police in five municipalities]{.underline}**, while Colt weapons went to
three other municipalities, as well as state police, according to a
state police document.

According to data recently released by the Mexican military, **[other
U.S. gun producers]{.underline}** that **[have exported thousands of
firearms]{.underline}** each **[to Mexico]{.underline}** **[for use by
the police or private individuals]{.underline}** include: Colt,
Bushmaster, Mossberg, Smith & Wesson, DS Arms, Remington, and Browning.
**[The Mexican military has]{.underline}** also **[purchased military
weapons from U.S. producers Nammo Talley, Barrett Firearms, and Knight
Armament Company]{.underline}** since 2014. In Veracruz, the police
responsible for at least 15 death squad murders purchased, since 2013,
at least 674 firearms exported by three U.S. arms companies: Colt,
Bushmaster, and Combined Systems, according to the Veracruz public
security secretariat. Local police in Veracruz also obtained weapons
from Sig Sauer and Connecticut-based Mossberg.

**[Beyond guns]{.underline}**, U.S. Census Bureau trade data show that
just over \$**[8.3 million in military explosives were delivered to
Mexico]{.underline}** from Arizona in September and October 2017, more
than in any year in the last decade for all states combined. (In all of
2016, military explosives exported from the entire United States to
Mexico amounted to less than \$800,000.) The Census records do not
indicate which company exported the explosives. In addition, **[Milkor
USA, based in Tucson, sold M32A1 grenade launchers used by the Mexican
military special forces. In 2017, more than \$5 million worth of grenade
launchers were exported to Mexico from Texas alone.]{.underline}**

**[[The permissive U.S. attitude toward gun exports has
prompted]{.mark}]{.underline}** several **[[gun producers based in
the]{.mark} [E]{.mark}]{.underline}**uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion **[[to beef up production in
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, thus **[[evading]{.mark} EU
[restrictions]{.mark} [on]{.mark} arms sales to countries [with
widespread]{.mark} violence or [human rights
violations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Sig Sauer]{.underline}**, for
instance, **[whose parent company is in Germany,]{.underline}** more
than **[quadrupled global exports from the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates between 2009 and 2016,
according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
(Germany stopped approving licenses for gun exports to Mexico after
2010.) Beretta (Italy) and Glock (Austria) produce guns in Tennessee and
Georgia, respectively, and are the two brands that Mexico has imported
in the largest numbers since 2007, per SEDENA records. The State
Department in February 2016 issued a license to Glock to export more
than 11,000 9mm and .45 caliber pistols from its Smyrna, Georgia,
facility for re-sale to Mexican police.

#### Cartels cause Mexican collapse -- that causes US draw-in -- makes allied prolif and great power war inevitable 

Robert **[Haddick 10]{.underline}**, Managing Editor of the Small Wars
Journal, This Week at War: If Mexico Is at War, Does America Have to Win

While answering a question on Mexico this week at the Council on Foreign
Relations, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary **[Clinton said, \"[We face
an increasing threat from]{.mark} a well-organized network,
[drug-trafficking]{.mark} threat [that is]{.mark},]{.underline}** in
some cases, **[[morphing into]{.mark},]{.underline}** or making common
cause with, **[what we would consider [an
insurgency]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" Mexico\'s foreign minister Patricia
Espinosa was quick to dispute this characterization, arguing that
Mexico\'s drug cartels have no political agenda. But as I have
previously discussed, the cartels, evidenced by their attacks on both
the government and the media, are gradually becoming political
insurgents as a means of defending their turf.¶ I note that Clinton used
the phrase \"We \[the United States\] face an increasing threat \...,\"
not \"they \[Mexico\].\" The cartels are transnational shipping
businesses, with consumers in the United States as their dominant
market. **[The clashes over shipping routes and distribution
power]{.underline}** \-- which over the past four years have killed
28,000 and thoroughly corrupted Mexico\'s police and judiciary \--
**[could just as well occur inside the United States]{.underline}**.
Indeed, growing anxiety that southern Arizona is in danger of becoming a
\"no-go zone\" controlled by drug and human traffickers contributed to
the passage of Arizona\'s controversial immigration enforcement statute
earlier this year.¶ Both Clinton and Mexican officials have discussed
Colombia\'s struggle against extreme drug violence and corruption,
revealing concerns about how dreadful the situation in Mexico might yet
become and also as a model for how to recover from disaster. Colombia\'s
long climb from the abyss, aided by the U.S. government\'s Plan Colombia
assistance, should certainly give hope to Mexico\'s counterinsurgents.
But if the United States and Mexico are to achieve similar success, both
will have to resolve political dilemmas that would prevent effective
action. Clinton herself acknowledged as much when she remarked that Plan
Colombia was \"controversial \... there were problems and there were
mistakes. But it worked.\"¶ [**[Isolating Mexico\'s cartel insurgents
from their enormous American revenue base]{.underline}** \-- **[a
crucial step]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in a counterinsurgency
campaign]{.underline}** \-- may require a much more severe border
crackdown, an action that would be highly controversial in both the
United States and Mexico. Plan Colombia was a success partly because of
the long-term presence of U.S. Special Forces advisers, intelligence
experts, and other military specialists inside Colombia, a presence
which would not please most Mexicans. And Colombia\'s long counterattack
against its insurgents resulted in actions that boiled the blood of many
human rights observers.¶ Most significantly**[, [a strengthening Mexican
insurgency would]{.mark} very likely [affect America\'s role in
the]{.mark} rest of the [world.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[An
increasingly chaotic American side of the border]{.mark}, marked by
bloody cartel wars]{.underline}**, corrupted government and media,
**[[and a breakdown in security, would]{.mark} likely [cause many in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to question the importance of]{.mark}
military and [foreign policy ventures elsewhere]{.mark} in the world.¶
[Should the southern border become a]{.mark} U.S. [president\'s
primary]{.mark} national security [concern, nervous allies and
opportunistic adversaries]{.mark} elsewhere in the world [would]{.mark}
no doubt [adjust to a distracted and inward-looking America,
with]{.mark} potentially [disruptive arms races the
result]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Secretary Clinton has looked south and
now sees an insurgency. Let\'s hope that the United States can apply
what it has recently learned about insurgencies to stop this one from
getting out of control.

## US/Mexican Econ A/O

#### Organized crime threatens Mexico's oil industry\-\--absent the plan, its economy and security are at risk

[Gabriel **Stargardter 18**]{.underline}, Graduate reporter at Reuters
working out of Mexico city, "Mexico\'s drug cartels, now hooked on fuel,
cripple nation\'s refineries," 1-24-2018,
<https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/mexico-violence-oil/>

[[Fuel theft is]{.mark} fast becoming one of Mexico's most pressing
economic and security dilemmas]{.underline}, [[sapping]{.mark} more than
[\$1 billion in annual revenue from state coffers, terrorizing workers
and deterring private investment]{.mark} in aging refineries that the
government]{.underline}, following a 2014 energy reform, hoped instead
would be thriving with foreign capital. [Because of government
offensives that toppled narco kingpins in recent years]{.underline},
Mexico\'s drug cartels have splintered and are eager for new sources of
revenue. Now, [their increasingly dominant role as [fuel thieves
pit]{.mark}s **two of the country's biggest industries [- narcotics and
oil ]{.mark}**[- against one another]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} cash-rich [[cartels]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[believed]{.underline}]{.mark} by the Mexican government [[to
generate]{.mark} well over [\$21 billion each year]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[are]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n increasing [threat to Pemex, which]{.mark} in
2016 reported revenue of about \$52 billion and **[generates]{.mark}
about [a fifth of government income]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "The
business is more profitable than drug trafficking because it implies
less risk," said Georgina Trujillo, a ruling party congresswoman who
heads the lower house energy commission. "You don't have to risk
crossing the border to look for a market," she added. "We all consume
gasoline. We don\'t all consume drugs." Pemex did not respond to
detailed questions from Reuters about the cartels and fuel theft. Among
other questions, Reuters asked about the cartels' impact on the
refineries, Pemex's security measures and how the company responds to
extortion and violence against its employees. One senior Pemex refining
executive, who asked not to be identified, said, "We worry about the
influence of organized crime," but would not discuss the issue further.
[Fuel theft is not new or unique to Mexico. But cartels are taking it to
calamitous new dimensions]{.underline} and, in the process, bolstering
their bottom line. "[**[Fuel theft]{.mark} just [makes these groups more
powerful]{.mark}**," according to one senior official from the U.S.
D]{.underline}rug [E]{.underline}nforcement
[A]{.underline}dministration, who asked not to be identified. \$1
billion Estimated value of annual losses to Mexican state coffers
because of fuel theft. [[By targeting refineries]{.mark}, already
suffering from a lack of investment, Mexico's most [notorious
criminals]{.mark} gain [access]{.mark} to [nerve centers for]{.mark}
much of [the country's fuel supply]{.mark}]{.underline}. That threatens
an oil industry that accounts for about 8 percent of Mexico's economy
and creates yet more uncertainty for a country already reeling from U.S.
threats to dismantle the North American Free Trade Agreement. "[[It
hurts]{.mark} the [national coffers, **weakens national security** and
hinders]{.mark} the [r]{.mark}eform [and]{.mark} [d]{.mark}evelopment
[of Mexico's energy market]{.mark},]{.underline}" said Gustavo Mohar, a
former Mexican energy and intelligence official. Between 2011 and 2016,
the number of unauthorized taps discovered on Mexico's fuel lines nearly
quintupled, according to a recent report by the federal auditor. Repair
costs surged almost tenfold, to 1.77 billion pesos (\$95 million). A May
2017 study, commissioned by the national energy regulator and obtained
by Reuters via a freedom of information request, found that thieves,
between 2009 and 2016, had tapped pipelines roughly every 1.4 kms (0.86
mi) along Pemex's approximately 14,000 km pipeline network. [After
decades of poor upkeep, the refineries are bleeding money as well as
fuel]{.underline}. In addition to unscheduled outages, which cause big
operational losses, maintenance problems have led to fatal accidents,
including fires and explosions. Together, the [[refineries have
accumulated annual]{.mark} operating [losses of]{.mark} about [\$5
billion]{.mark} in recent years]{.underline}. Production of refined
products, meanwhile, fell to just over 700,000 barrels per day in 2017.
That's about half the production levels at the refineries' peak in 1994.

political instability. One of the most cited papers on the subject is a
1996 study by Alberto Alesina and Roberto Perotti in which they found
that [[economic problems]{.mark}, including increased inequality, [fuel
public discontent and]{.mark} social unrest. This kind of unrest
[increase]{.mark}s the [likelihood of]{.mark} even more [extreme
political instability]{.mark}]{.underline}, including protests, coups
and revolutions, according to Alesina and Perotti. This dynamic has
played out in country after country. Economic pressures were part of the
drivers of the Arab Spring protests in Egypt and across the region. [The
current economic recession in Brazil and a century of economic turmoil
in Argentina have both been linked to political instability in those
countries]{.underline}. Or, to take an example of the relationship
working in the reverse: The Chinese government's primary tool for
survival --- social stability --- depends almost entirely upon its
ability to maintain economic growth. We've seen it here at home, too:
The Great Recession that began in 2008 preceded, in quick succession,
the tea party movement and Occupy Wall Street, forces that are in some
ways still at play today. As many of these examples make clear, the
effect goes the other way, too: According to Alesina and Perotti, **[a
weakened economy --- especially when it exacerbates economic inequality
--- leads to political instability, but political [instability also
hurts the economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It inserts uncertainty into
the environment, which leads to less investment. A recent paper by Ari
Aisen and Francisco José Veiga finds that [political instability can
also reduce productivity and human capital development]{.underline};
both governments and families become less likely to prioritize education
or training. [This cycle means political instability, once it emerges,
is hard to shake: A bad economy is politically destabilizing, which
worsens the economy, which is further destabilizing.]{.underline} Syria
is an example of this perpetual cycle at its worst: Early protests were
met with violence, which turned into an intractable conflict, which has
all but obliterated the country's economy, which makes political
recovery even harder. Applying this to Mexico, if Trump's policies go
through, even partially, we could be looking at some significant
political and economic consequences for the country. One of the biggest
political challenges in Mexico is corruption, which tends to get worse
under economic pressure.1 Officials and citizens become more desperate,
and there is weakened state capacity to combat it. [Drug trafficking and
violent crime,]{.underline} also huge problems in Mexico, [are also
likely to increase under worse economic conditions]{.underline} ---
again, as people become more desperate.2 The most destabilizing path is
less ripe for a TV series, but more concerning. Mexico's fledgling
middle class is likely to be squeezed by Trump's policies through price
increases and unemployment.3 This discontent could lead to protests, or
the election of a populist leader, who will promise aggressive
anti-American policies. (Sound familiar?). [Economic downturns can also
heighten conflict between social groups]{.underline} --- of which Mexico
has many --- pitting previously peacefully co-existing groups against
each other. And while [[Mexico's]{.underline}]{.mark} democracy has
recently showed some signs of stability, it's [still on many policy
watch lists, especially for [crime and corruption]{.mark},]{.underline}
both of [which]{.underline}, again, [[are]{.mark} [likely to]{.mark} be
the first to [worsen under economic pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Trump Complies -- 2AC

#### He'll comply\-\--he's more scared of a court decision.

Asha **Rangappa 18**. Senior lecturer at the Jackson Institute for
Global Affairs at Yale University and a former special agent in the
Counterintelligence Division of the FBI. 02-20-2018.
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/20/how-trump-could-end-up-diminishing-his-own-power-217035

In the coming weeks, President Donald **[Trump is going to find himself
making a decision he's bound to hate: Does he]{.underline}** want to
**[comply]{.underline}** with Robert Mueller, **[or risk diminishing his
own power?]{.underline}** Here's why this choice is inevitable. In the
wake of his eight-count indictment against 13 Russian nationals and
three Russian entities for election interference, special counsel Robert
Mueller's interest in interviewing Trump will take on a renewed
importance. So far, all signs have pointed to Trump's refusing the
interview request, which would almost certainly force Mueller to issue a
grand jury subpoena to compel the president to talk.
**[[If]{.underline}]{.mark}** this comes to pass, and **[[the president
refuses]{.mark} to comply]{.underline}** with such a subpoena, the
country will be in uncharted constitutional territory, and **[the
[courts]{.mark} will]{.underline}** need to
**[[intervene]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[But]{.mark} history shows
that]{.underline}** **[when courts intervene]{.underline}** because a
president is trying to shield his own conduct, **[[the deck is]{.mark}
stacked [against him]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[If Trump
isn't]{.underline}** **[careful]{.underline}**, **[he will end
up]{.underline}** shrinking his own authority---and **[diminishing the
presidency]{.underline}** for years to come. When it comes to the
separation of powers, the Constitution makes it look pretty simple:
Congress makes the laws, the president enforces them and the judiciary
adjudicates them. In reality, though, the lines between the branches are
a little blurrier than they seem on paper. Writing in 1952, Supreme
Court Justice Robert Jackson noted that presidential power sometimes
lies in a "zone of twilight," where the precise boundaries of Article
II, which defines the president's role, are unclear. **[In general, it's
in the interest]{.underline}** **[of presidents to leave]{.underline}**
some of **[their authority in the gray area.]{.underline}** This is
**[because]{.underline}** **[[having a court
decide]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[where presidential
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}** begins and **[ends]{.underline}**
[**[leaves it]{.underline}** **[set in stone]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and
applies to anyone who occupies the office in the future. In practice,
**[[presidents]{.underline}]{.mark}** have typically tended to [[think
of themselves]{.mark} not just [as stewards]{.mark} for their party, but
also [of the presidency]{.mark} itself]{.underline}---preserving the
full scope of its constitutional power for their successors is part of
their job. **[For this reason]{.underline}**, **[[when questions
arise]{.mark} about]{.underline}** **[whether the president can or can't
do something]{.underline}**, **[[it's better]{.mark}, from the
presidential]{.underline}** **[perspective]{.underline}**, **[[not
to]{.mark} have the issue [go to court]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Sometimes
**[this will be [by]{.mark}]{.underline}** getting Congress on board to
authorize and fortify executive powers---think of the Authorization for
the Use of Military Force, or the recently renewed Section 702 of FISA
that permits the executive to conduct electronic surveillance on foreign
targets. Other times, it might just be **[[reluctant
compliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as when President Ronald Reagan
handed over his personal diaries to Iran-Contra Independent Counsel
Lawrence Walsh, or when President Bill Clinton agreed to give testimony
to the grand jury in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
Whitewater/Lewinsky investigation. **[Of course,]{.underline}**
**[courts can and do intervene when presidents]{.underline}** attempt to
**[extend their authority too far or refuse to negotiate]{.underline}**
on the parameters. **[The]{.underline}** Supreme **[Court reined
in]{.underline}** President Harry **[Truman when he tried to use his war
powers to take over domestic steel]{.underline}** mills during the
Korean War, **[and brushed back]{.underline}** President George W.
**[Bush]{.underline}** **[when he established military
tribunals]{.underline}** to try suspected terrorists at Guantánamo Bay.
The nature of **[our constitutional system presumes]{.underline}** that
**[the executive branch will try to overreach,]{.underline}** **[and
having the judiciary impose limits]{.underline}** **[on the presidency
is appropriate and necessary in these instances]{.underline}**. When
these cases are about contested policies, limits on presidential power
can strengthen our constitutional democracy overall by promoting the
robust expression of checks and balances, encouraging collaboration with
Congress, or reaffirming individual rights. However, when judicial
limits on the president's power arise over a dispute concerning his own
alleged bad conduct, they weaken the presidency for the wrong reasons.
In such situations, the president isn't defending some larger goal in
the national interest. Rather, he's simply using it as a shield to avoid
being held accountable for his personal behavior or criminal acts. The
most famous example is President Richard Nixon, who claimed executive
privilege to avoid providing incriminating information to Watergate
special prosecutor Leon Jaworski. The resulting Supreme Court case, U.S.
v. Nixon, dealt the presidency a blow by ruling that claims of executive
privilege didn't insulate him from having to turn over records that
might have evidentiary value in a criminal proceeding. Similarly,
Clinton's attempt to use the same tactic to keep his aides from
testifying before Starr's grand jury failed, with a court deciding that
"personal matters" did not fall within the scope of the privilege. These
were the worst kind of cases to test the limits of presidential power,
because they weren't about the role of the presidency, but the
individual occupying the office. This makes a difference. **[[When
presidents]{.underline}]{.mark}** decide to **[[litigate]{.mark} an
issue to protect their [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[decisions]{.underline}**, **[they]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[are]{.underline}** more **[likely to [act]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[judiciously]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and **[[with an eye toward
compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[because they]{.mark} can
[see]{.mark} the larger [implications]{.mark} for the legacy of their
office.]{.underline}** But when presidents are just trying to keep their
own bad or illegal conduct from public view---or keep themselves out of
jail---they end up placing the power of the presidency at risk
unnecessarily, with no real benefits to the other branches, individual
rights or the country generally if they lose. They offer courts a way to
extend these decision to other contexts in the future, tying the
president's hands in ways we might not want.

### Trump Compliance -- 1AR

#### Despite his narrative, Trump folds when faced with congressional checks

**[Chotiner 18]{.underline}** \[Isaac Chotiner is a Slate staff writer
interviewing Quinta Jurecic, the managing editor of the website Lawfare,
6-27-2018
<https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/anthony-kennedy-retires-will-john-roberts-be-the-supreme-courts-new-swing-vote.html>\]

**[You wrote]{.underline}** a piece **[about
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the pardon power, **[and
wrote]{.underline}**, "**[He's only too happy to wield 'absolute
power']{.underline}** **[but]{.underline}** [**[tends to
fold]{.underline}** **[when]{.underline}**]{.mark} that
[**[power]{.underline}** **[turns out]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to be
[less than absolute]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Can you expand upon what
you meant by that? So my point with the pardon power is that
[**[Trump]{.underline}** **[wants to be a
dictator]{.underline}**]{.mark}. And I don't actually think that that
should be that controversial a statement. He's expressed his admiration
for dictators. He talks about wanting to control the Department of
Justice, jail his political opponents. **[[But]{.mark} the thing
is]{.underline}**, **[[while]{.mark} [he talks a big game he]{.mark}
[hasn't actually done]{.mark}]{.underline}** any of **[[those
things]{.underline}]{.mark}** right. He hasn't ordered the prosecution
of Hillary Clinton. He fired James Comey but then that's kind of been
it. **[We know that]{.underline}** **[he's tried to fire
Mueller]{.underline}** at least **[twice]{.underline}**, **[and both
times]{.underline}** he **[backed off]{.underline}**. So it seems to me
that **[he came into office thinking that this]{.underline}** **[was
going to be like being the king]{.underline}**. **[And]{.underline}**
**[then [when he receives]{.mark} [pushback]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[he's]{.mark} kind of [surprised]{.mark} [and]{.mark} he
[doesn't]{.mark} actually [push forward]{.mark}]{.underline}** and try
**[[to muscle through]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Like with the travel ban
ruling, for example, he went back to the drawing board. He didn't try to
go forward with the initial ban against the courts. The pardon power is
this area of his presidency that he's discovered, where he actually does
have absolute power. There's not anything that anyone can do to keep him
from pardoning someone. There's not an institutional check on it. It's
really just him. And so it's this sort of pressure release valve for his
more dictatorial impulses. It seems like what you're saying therefore is
that the pardon power is the one thing where there are no checks, and so
when there are no checks he can do what he wants, which suggests to me
that if other checks, whether they're congressional, judicial, whatever
they might be, don't push back on him in some way, that he's more likely
to get more dangerous? I think that's right. And
**[that's]{.underline}** one of the reasons **[why I've been so
disturbed by the failure of]{.underline}** Republicans in
**[[Congress]{.mark} to push back.]{.underline}** We've sort of ended up
in this strange pattern where Republicans will sort of ... You know
Trump will threaten to do something like remove Muller for example,
Republicans in Congress will say "Oh well we don't need to do anything
about that because he's not actually going to do it." Right. And then
Trump will take a step further and he'll motion toward doing it in a
more concrete way. You know news reports will surface that he's been
talking about it and then there is this sort of collective shudder from
Republican leadership in **[Congress]{.underline}** where they all
**[[say]{.underline}]{.mark}** **["Whoa, whoa, whoa,]{.underline}** I
mean sure but **[not that]{.underline}**." Like, [**[you can't go that
far.]{.underline}** **[And then Trump]{.underline}**]{.mark} kind of
**[[gets burned and he]{.mark} [takes a step back]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[and]{.mark} he [doesn't try]{.mark} anything]{.underline}** and then
the whole cycle begins again. And what worries me is that the more this
goes on, the more Trump becomes confident that he might be able to get
away with something without pushback, because **[if the pushback isn't
preemptive there's nothing from stopping him]{.underline}** doing it in
the first place. And that's what I think is really dangerous.

### Courts Check -- 2AC

#### Courts check breaching treaties

**[Kirgis 97]{.underline}** (Frederic L. Kirgis, Law School Alumni

International Law,

**[Even if a treaty or other international agreement is
non-self-executing, it may have an indirect effect in U. S. courts. The
courts\' practice, mentioned above, of]{.underline}** **[interpreting
acts of Congress as consistent with earlier international agreements
applies]{.underline}** to earlier non-self-executing agreements **[as
well as to self-executing ones]{.underline}**, **[since]{.underline}**
in either case **[the agreement is binding internationally and courts
are slow to place the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[in breach of its international
obligations]{.underline}**. In addition, **[[if]{.mark} state or local
[law]{.mark} [is inconsistent with an international agreement]{.mark} of
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates**[, the [courts will
not allow the law]{.mark} to stand]{.underline}**. The reason, [i**[f
the international agreement is a self-executing
treaty]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[is [that]{.mark} such a [treaty has
the same effect in]{.mark} domestic [courts as an act of Congress
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** therefore **[directly [supersedes any
inconsistent]{.mark}]{.underline}** state or local **[[law.]{.mark} If
the international agreement is a non-self-executing treaty, it would not
supersede inconsistent state or local law]{.underline}** in **[the same
way a federal statute would]{.underline}**, **[but the courts
nevertheless would not permit a state of the union to force
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[to breach its international obligation]{.underline}** to other
countries under the agreement. The state or local law would be struck
down as an interference with the federal government\'s power over
foreign affairs.

To summarize: the Senate does not ratify treaties; the President does.
**[Treaties]{.underline}**, in the U. S. sense, **[are not the only type
of binding international agreement.]{.underline}**
Congressional-Executive agreements and Sole Executive agreements may
also be binding. It is generally understood that treaties and
Congressional-Executive agreements are interchangeable; Sole Executive
agreements occupy a more limited space constitutionally and are linked
primarily if not exclusively to the President\'s powers as commander in
chief and head diplomat. **[[Treaties]{.mark} and other international
agreements [are subject to the Bill of
Rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[Congress may supersede a
prior inconsistent treaty or Congressional-Executive agreement as a
matter of U. S. law, but not as a matter of international
law]{.underline}**. **[Courts in the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[use their powers of
interpretation to try not to let Congress place the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[in violation of its
international law obligations]{.underline}**. **[A self-executing treaty
provision is the supreme law of the land in the same sense as a federal
statute that is judicially enforceable by private
parties]{.underline}**. Even a non-self-executing provision of an
international agreement represents an international obligation that
courts are very much inclined to protect against encroachment by local,
state or federal law.

**[First]{.underline}**, **[[in arguing]{.mark} that [Articles 5 and

that **[these laws would be insufficient]{.underline}**. That being the

that **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited

**[Second]{.underline}**, **[[Bolton]{.mark} and Yoo]{.underline}** seem
to **[[suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[the ATT would enable

**[[incorrect]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As they later acknowledge, **[[the
Supreme Court held]{.mark} in Reid v. Covert]{.underline}** that
[**[treaties cannot violate the protections enshrined in the Bill of
Rights]{.underline}**.]{.mark} The right to bear arms being one of those
protections, it is obvious that **[a ratified ATT would have to comport
with the Second Amendment]{.underline}**. And as I explained in my
previous post, I think the treaty in fact would, particularly given the
common practice of adding reservations to address issues of this nature.

[**[Third]{.underline}**, **[the argument that the President could use
the ATT to circumvent the Tenth Amendment seems
unpersuasive]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[Because the treaty focuses on
international arms transfers,]{.underline}** **[[its restrictions
fall]{.underline}]{.mark}** easily **[[within Congress's ample powers to
regulate]{.mark} foreign and interstate
[commerce]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[even assuming the ATT
would interfere with a traditional domain of state power]{.underline}**,
**[that fact would not render the treaty unconstitutional. As Bolton and
Yoo concede,]{.underline}** longstanding **[[Supreme Court precedent
holds that the Tenth Amendment does not restrict the treaty
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This concession forces them to argue
that the Court's precedent has been wrongly decided, which is the same
as saying that the ATT is constitutional under that
precedent.]{.underline}**

**[Bolton and Yoo]{.underline}** also **[attack the ATT on the ground
that it is "far easier,]{.underline}**" and thus more problematic, **[to
adopt gun restrictions by treaty than through normal
legislation]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}** also **[seems
incorrect]{.underline}**. Unlike a statute, **[the passage of which
requires only simple majorities]{.underline}**, **[[a treaty must win
approval from two-thirds of the Senate]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Official
practice is consistent with the view that this heightened voting
requirement poses a greater hurdle than bicameralism: according to one
study, from 1980 to 2000 the United States entered into over 2700
congressional-executive agreements, which are the same as statutes in
the procedures required for their adoption, but only 375 treaties. **[If
it were far easier to adopt treaties]{.underline}**, **[one would think
that they would outnumber congressional-executive
agreements]{.underline}**, or at least rival them in frequency,
**[particularly]{.underline}** **[given]{.underline}** **[the widely
held position]{.underline}** that **[treaties and

### AT: Ignored

#### Constraints effective

Aziz **Huq 12**. Assistant Professor of Law, University of Chicago Law
School. August 2012."BINDING THE EXECUTIVE (BY LAW OR BY POLITICS)."
<http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/400-ah-binding.pdf>

To see the utility of reorienting attention to the interaction of legal
and political mechanisms, notice how the respective frailties and
strengths of legal and political mechanisms of executive constraint play
out. **[Objections that legal rules are mere parchment barriers lose
much of their force when a political coalition stands behind that
law]{.underline}** or constitutional principle. **[The Madisonian
architecture of separated powers i]{.underline}**n which each branch
defends its own prerogatives **[may be fragile, but
[congress]{.mark}ional coalitions [can]{.mark} and do nonetheless push
to [enforce specific legal]{.mark} [constraints]{.mark} for electoral or
normative reasons.]{.underline}** That political coalitions should
marshal their capital behind specific laws is not surprising: statutes
and other rules often embody, in a temporally durable form, the
political commitments of a given political coalition.
**[[Statutes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, moreover, **[[can be used as focal
points for organizing]{.mark} by [that coalition to enable
resistance]{.mark} against the disruptive initiatives of new
Presidents]{.underline}** and emergent factions. The interaction of law
with political commitments can be observed in granular form within the
executive. American political culture has developed in a path-dependent
fashion that invests legal rules with normative significance. With
notable outliers on both sides of the aisle, most officials express
sincere normative preferences for legality and constitutionalism.207
Legality has its own standing constituency. That lobby is cultivated by
law schools and by law professors who profess to teach what the
Constitution and federal statutes command. This has consequences for the
breadth of presidential discretion because lawyers trained in this
tradition currently staff the length and breadth of the executive
branch. These lawyers' preferences for legality impose frictions on
executive initiatives that run afoul of legal limits. At the limit,
these lawyers are likely aware of the leverage they have by dint of the
fact that their noisy exit would inflict damage on the government's
policy projects. As one scholar of executive branch legal interpretation
has recently observed, **[[good-faith lawyering]{.mark} by attorneys
within the Justice Department and other components of the executive
[will constrain]{.mark} presidential [options]{.mark} so long
as]{.underline}** "the press, the lawyerly public, and **[Congress \[\]
care about preserving the traditional structures of executive-branch
legal interpretation]{.underline}**." 208 Outside government, **[[legal
rules]{.underline}]{.mark}** and legally constituted institutions
**[also [furnish]{.mark} something of [a solution to]{.mark} some of
[the transaction]{.mark} cost [and info]{.mark}rmation [cost problems
for]{.mark} groups within [the]{.mark} general [public]{.mark} wishing
[to challenge]{.mark} government [policy]{.mark}
decision]{.underline}**s. 209 Laws and legal institutions reduce the
coordination and informational costs for the public associated with
identifying undesirable acts by the government in three ways. First,
**[legislators and judges]{.underline}**, as holders of institutional
power and as generally recognized experts in matters of legality,
**[[are vested with]{.mark} publicly recognized [authority to draw
attention]{.mark} and to seek remediation]{.underline}**.210 Compared to
ordinary citizens, they also have greater access to media platforms.
**[[They can]{.mark} thus better [disseminate]{.mark}
[info]{.mark}rmation, priming the electorate to attend to issues
[and]{.mark} thereby [lowering the costs of collective
action]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 211 **[Second, [legislators]{.mark} and
judges [have]{.mark} credible [tools to threaten the executive ranging
from politically damaging criticism to enactment of new]{.mark}
[rules]{.mark} further [binding the President]{.mark}]{.underline}**.212
**[Finally, specific legal rules can mitigate informational and
coordination problems beyond their function as focal
points]{.underline}**. The First Amendment, most obviously, ensures that
information in the public sphere may be transmitted freely; prior
restraints against national media are de facto unknown today. In the
national security domain, **[remedies such as habeas corpus have served
as informational platforms by revealing details of executive policies
that contradict official narratives]{.underline}**.213 **[[Ex
ante]{.mark} legal [prohibitions]{.mark} also [make]{.mark} public
[coordination easier because violation]{.mark} of legal rules [is
evidence that an]{.mark} executive [act is
undesirable]{.mark}]{.underline}**, harmful, or unjustified. Whatever
justifications the executive offers, the public knows that a previous
political coalition already weighed the costs and benefits of a policy
and found a categorical bar appropriate.

have **[[take]{.underline}]{.mark}**n **[his]{.underline}**

**[process]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** would
**[normally]{.underline}** **[inform]{.underline}**
**[decisions]{.underline}** of such consequence. It is too soon to tell
whether this gale of newfound assertiveness is a harbinger or blip. If
it is the former, we don't yet know whether Trump intends to concentrate
on the issues that motivate him most---trade, immigration, and
terrorism---or whether he is now emboldened to realize the broader
agenda that he advocated during his presidential bid---including
abandoning longstanding U.S. alliances, and allowing, if not
encouraging, nuclear proliferation. Ultimately, **[while he may incur
costs]{.underline}**, [**[nothing]{.underline}** **[bars]{.underline}**
**[Trump]{.underline}** **[from]{.underline}**]{.mark} circumventing or
**[[disregarding]{.underline}]{.mark}** the advice of the
Senate-confirmed **[[cabinet officials]{.underline}]{.mark}** who
comprise his National Security Council. Indeed, as a populist figure who
has insisted "I alone can fix" what ails America, Trump is more likely
to do so than his recent predecessors. **[[Congress, however, can push
back]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Edward Corwin's famous assertion that
**[the Constitution "is an invitation]{.underline}** **[to struggle for
the privilege of directing American]{.underline}** **[foreign
policy]{.underline}**," may seem quaint today, against the backdrop of a
steady, decades-long expansion of executive branch power. But **[[if
Trump does]{.underline}]{.mark}** move to fully
**[[unmoor]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. [**[foreign
policy]{.underline}**, **[he]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[might [stir
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[slumbering giant]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Congress could, for example, impose obstacles to the removal of a U.S.
troop presence in allied countries, in the same manner that it has
historically legislated restrictions on U.S. trade relationships and
defense sales, or as the Senate recently voted, 98-2, to effectively
freeze Trump's Russia policy by limiting his ability to suspend or lift
sanctions on Russia. Congress also could seek to constrain relevant
departments and agencies from implementing certain presidential
decisions, through bureaucratic restructuring and invasive oversight
demands. Particularly if it finds bipartisan voice,
**[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [**[could]{.underline}**
**[shift public opinion]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[[putting pressure on
Trump's reelection]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### [Self-interest]{.underline} and [normative]{.underline} pressure

Richard H. **Pildes 12**. Sudler Family Professor of Constitutional Law
at the NYU School of Law and Co-Director of the NYU Center on Law and
Security. April 2012. "Book Review: Law and the President." 125 Harv. L.
Rev. 1381. Lexis.

The Incomplete Consequentialist Theory for the Role of Law For these
reasons, I want to move beyond empirical issues and engage Posner and
Vermeule on their own terms, and at a deeper, more theoretical, and
general level. Posner and Vermeule see presidents as Holmesians, not
Hartians. n69 Yet **[even if we enter their purely consequentialist
world, in which presidents follow the law not out of any normative
obligation or the more specific duty to faithfully execute the laws but
only when the cost-benefit metric of compliance is more favorable than
that of noncompliance, [powerful reasons]{.mark} [suggest that
presidents will comply]{.mark} with law far more often than Posner and
Vermeule imply. A]{.underline}**nd analysis of those reasons might also
point us to understanding better the contexts in which presidents are
less likely to comply (either by invoking disingenuous or wholly
unpersuasive legal interpretations or by defying the law outright). The
Posner and Vermeule approach is characteristic of a general approach to
assessing public institutions and the behavior of judges, legislators,
presidents, and other public officials that has emerged recently within
legal scholarship. Under the influence of rational-choice theory and
empirical social science from other disciplines, such as political
science and economics, some public law scholarship has shifted to trying
to predict and understand the behavior of public officials wholly in
terms of the material incentives to which they are posited to respond.
These incentives include the power of effective sanctions other actors
can impose on public officials who deviate from those actors\' preferred
positions. In this general rational-choice approach, considerations of
morality or duty internal to the legal system do not motivate public
actors. Indeed, in the case of **[Posner and Vermeule\'s book, that is
more the working assumption of the approach than a fact that the
theories actually prove. Public officials do not follow the law out of
any felt normative sense of official or moral obligation.]{.underline}**
In what they view as hard-headed realism, scholars like Posner and
Vermeule believe a more external perspective is required to understand
presidential behavior. All that matters, from this vantage point, are
the consequences that will or will not flow from compliance or defiance
and manipulation of the law. If other actors, including Congress, the
\[\*1405\] courts, or \"the public\" (whatever that might mean,
precisely) will accept an action, the President will be able to do it;
if not, his credibility and power will be undermined. It is that
externally oriented cost-benefit calculation - not the law and not any
internal sense of obligation to obey the law - that determines how
presidents act in fact. Thus, \"politics,\" not \"law,\" determines how
much discretion presidents actually have. This approach to presidential
power finds its analog in the way a number of constitutional law
scholars have come to portray the behavior of the Supreme Court. These
scholars, such as Professors Michael Klarman, n70 Barry Friedman, n71
Jack Balkin, n72 and others, have asserted various versions of what I
call the \"majoritarian thesis\" n73: the claim that Court decisions are
constrained to reflect the policy preferences of national political
majorities (or national political elite majorities), rather than the
outcomes that good-faith internal elaboration of legal doctrine would
compel based on normative considerations about appropriate methods of
legal reasoning and interpretation. In some versions of the majoritarian
thesis, these potential external sanctions impose outer boundaries on
the degrees of freedom the Court has; within those boundaries, the Court
remains free to act on its own considerations, including perhaps purely
legal ones as viewed from an internal perspective. In other versions,
the Court is cast as almost mirroring the preferences of national
political majorities. Here, too, the behavior of the Court is seen as
based less on internal, legal considerations and more on the anticipated
external reactions to decisions. At an even broader theoretical level,
Professor Daryl Levinson has employed the same kind of purely
consequentialist framework to analyze what he calls the \"puzzle\" of
the stability and effectiveness in general of constitutional law. n74
Constitutional law decisions often frustrate \[\*1406\] the preferences
of political majorities. As Levinson puts it, the question of why those
majorities do or should ever abide by such decisions is much like the
question of why presidents do or should abide by law. For Levinson, as
for Posner and Vermeule, legal compliance, to the extent that it occurs,
cannot be explained by more traditional accounts of the normative force
of law or by the sense that courts are politically legitimate
institutions whose authority ought to be accepted for that reason.
Instead, the explanation must lie in considerations external to the
legal system, such as the material incentives other actors have to obey,
or ignore, Court decisions. Levinson then catalogues an array of
material incentives political majorities confront in deciding whether to
follow Court decisions whose outcomes they dislike; the **[resulting
cost-benefit calculations end up making compliance with Court decisions
usually the \"rational\" course of action even for disappointed
political majorities (at least in well-functioning constitutional
systems). n75 Thus, [the rational-choice and normative views end up
converging]{.mark} in practice]{.underline}**. And presumably, **[most
actors do not]{.underline}** actually **[run through]{.underline}**
these **[consequentialist calculations]{.underline}** in deciding
whether to obey particular Court decisions. Instead, these calculations
lie deep beneath the surface of much larger systems of education,
socialization, public discourse, and the like; most individuals,
including **[public [officials, comply]{.mark}]{.underline}** with Court
decisions **[[unreflectively]{.mark}, because it is the \"right\" thing
to do]{.underline}**. But the rational-choice framework leaves open the
possibility that, at any given moment, the actors the Court\'s decision
limits - the President, Congress, state legislatures, or others - could
mobilize the underlying cost-benefit calculations that otherwise lie
latent and conclude that, this time around, refusal to abide by the law
is the more \"rational\" course. But as Levinson\'s work helps to show,
even on its own terms, Posner and Vermeule\'s approach offers an
incomplete account of the role of law. Levinson\'s work, for example, is
devoted to showing why **[constitutional law will be followed, even by
disappointed political majorities, for purely instrumental reasons, even
if]{.underline}** those **[majorities do not experience any internal
sense of duty to obey]{.underline}**. He identifies **[[at least six
rational-choice mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[will
lead]{.mark} rational [actors to adhere]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
constitutional law decisions of the Supreme Court: **[[coordination,
reputation, repeat-play, reciprocity,]{.mark} asset-specific
[investment, and positive political feedback]{.mark}
[mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. n76 No obvious reason exists to
explain why all or some of these mechanisms would fail to lead
presidents similarly to calculate that **[[compliance]{.mark} with the
law [is]{.mark} usually [important to]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[\*1407\]
**[a range of important [presidential objectives]{.mark}. At the very
least]{.underline}**, for example, **[the executive branch is an
enormous organization, and]{.underline}** for internal organizational
efficacy, as well as effective cooperation with other parts of the
government, **[law serves an essential coordination function that
presidents]{.underline}** and their advisors typically **[have an
interest in respecting]{.underline}**. There is a reason executive
branch departments are staffed with hundreds of lawyers: while Posner
and Vermeule might cynically speculate that the reason is to figure out
how to circumvent the law artfully, the truth, surely, is that law
enables these institutions to function effectively, both internally and
in conjunction with other institutions, and that lawyers are there to
facilitate that role. **[In contrast to Posner and
Vermeule]{.underline}**, who argue that law does not constrain, and who
then search for substitute constraints, **[scholars like Levinson
establish that rational-choice theory helps explain why law does
constrain]{.underline}**. Indeed, as Posner and Vermeule surely know,
**[[there is a significant literature]{.mark} within the rational-choice
framework [that explains why]{.mark} powerful political [actors would
agree to accept and sustain]{.mark} legal [constraints]{.mark} on their
power]{.underline}**, including the institution of judicial review. n77
That **[[P]{.mark}osner [and V]{.mark}ermeule [miss the role of legal
compliance as]{.mark}]{.underline}** a powerful signal, perhaps **[[the
most]{.mark} [powerful signal]{.mark}, in [maintaining]{.mark} a
President\'s critical [credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}** as a
well-motivated user of discretionary power is all the more surprising in
light of the central role executive self-binding constraints play in
their theory. After asserting that \"one of the greatest constraints on
\[presidential\] aggrandizement\" is \"the president\'s own interest in
maintaining his credibility\" (p. 133), they define their project as
seeking to discover the \"social-scientific microfoundations\" (p. 123)
of presidential credibility: the ways in which presidents establish and
maintain credibility. One of the most crucial and effective mechanisms,
in their view, is executive self-binding, \"whereby executives commit
themselves to a course of action that would impose higher costs on
ill-motivated actors\" (p. 137). As they also put it, \"a well-motivated
president can distinguish himself from an ill-motivated president by
binding himself to a policy position that an ill-motivated president
would reject\" (p. 135). By complying with these constraints, presidents
signal their good faith and accrue more trust to take further action.
Most importantly from within Posner and Vermeule\'s theory, these
constraints, many self-generated through executive self-binding,
substitute for the constraints of law. Law does not, or cannot, or
should not constrain presidents, in their view, but **[rational-actor
presidents recognize that]{.underline}** \[\*1408\] **[complying with
constraints is in their own self-interest]{.underline}**; presidents
therefore substitute or accept other constraints. Thus, Posner and
Vermeule recognize the importance of \"enabling constraints\" n78 in
effective mobilization and maintenance of political power; that is, they
recognize that what appear to be short-term constraints on the immediate
preferences of actors like presidents might actually enable long-term
marshaling of effective presidential power. Yet they somehow miss that
law, too, can work as an enabling constraint; when it comes to law,
Posner and Vermeule seem to see nothing but constraint. Indeed, this
failing runs even deeper. For if presidents must signal submission to
various constraints to maintain and enhance their credibility - as
Posner and Vermeule insist they must - Posner and Vermeule miss the fact
that the single most powerful signal of that willingness to be
constrained, particularly in American political culture, is probably the
President\'s willingness to comply with law. **[In theoretical
terms]{.underline}**, then, **[Posner and Vermeule emerge as
inconsistent or incomplete consequentialists. Even if law does not bind
presidents purely for normative reasons, [presidents]{.mark} will [have
powerful]{.mark} [incentives to comply]{.mark} with law]{.underline}** -
even more powerful than the incentives Posner and Vermeule rightly
recognize presidents will have to comply with other constraints on their
otherwise naked power. **[To the extent that Posner and Vermeule mean to
acknowledge this point but argue that it means presidents are not
\"really\" complying with the law and are only bowing to these other
incentives, they are drawing a semantic distinction that seems of
limited pragmatic significance, as the next Part shows.]{.underline}**

What the Arms Trade Treaty Does

**[[The A]{.mark}rms [T]{.mark}rade [T]{.mark}reaty [requires all
states-parties]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline}** adopt basic
regulations and approval processes for the flow of weapons across
international borders, establishes common international standards that
must be met before arms exports are authorized, and requires annual
reporting of imports and exports to a treaty secretariat. In particular,
the treaty:

requires that states "establish and maintain a national control system,
including a national control list" and "designate competent national
authorities in order to have an effective and transparent national
control system regulating the transfer of conventional arms";

**[[prohibit]{.mark}s [arms transfer]{.mark} authorizations to states
[if the transfer]{.mark} would [violate "obligations under measures
adopted by the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [S]{.mark}ecurity
[C]{.mark}ouncil acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United
Nations, [in particular]{.mark} arms [embargoes" or]{.mark} under [other
"relevant international obligations]{.mark}" [or
if]{.mark}]{.underline}** the state "has knowledge at the time of
authorization **[that [the arms]{.mark} or items [would be used in the
commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions]{.mark} of 1949, [attacks directed against]{.mark}
civilian objects or [civilians]{.mark} protected as such, [or other war

**[[requires states]{.mark} to [assess the potential that the

security" or could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of
i]{.mark}nternational [h]{.mark}umanitarian [or h]{.mark}uman
[r]{.mark}ights [law, acts of terrorism, or transnational organized
crime]{.mark}]{.underline}**; to consider measures to mitigate the risk
of these violations; and, if there still remains an "overriding risk" of
"negative consequences," to "not authorize the export";

**[[applies]{.mark} under Article 2(1) [to all conventional

Register of Conventional Arms (**[[battle tanks, armored combat
vehicles, large-caliber artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack
helicopters, warships,]{.mark} and [missiles and missile launchers) and
small arms]{.mark} and light weapons]{.underline}**;

requires that states "establish and maintain a national control system
to regulate the export of ammunition/munitions fired, launched or
delivered by" the conventional arms listed in Article 2(1) and "parts
and components...that provide the capability to assemble" the
conventional arms listed in that article;

requires each state to "take the appropriate measures, pursuant to its
national laws, to regulate brokering taking place under its
jurisdiction" of conventional arms covered under Article 2(1);

**[requires each state to "take measures to prevent...diversion" of
conventional arms covered under Article 2(1);]{.underline}**

requires each state to submit annually to the treaty secretariat a
report of the preceding year's "authorized or actual export and imports
of conventional arms covered under Article 2(1)" and allows states to
exclude "commercially sensitive or national security information"

### Counter Interpretation \-\-- reduce \-\-- 2AC

#### Counter-interpretation \-\-- prohibition is the best form of reduction

Jan **[Ondřej N.D]{.underline}**, writer for the Slovak society of
international law since 2007, "Mixed Instruments in International
Disarmament and Humanitarian Law",
https://www.syil.sk/products/ondrej-jan-mixed-instruments-in-international-disarmament-and-humanitarian-law/

Mixed Instruments combine elements of the Disarmament Law and
Humanitarian Law. **[[Disarmament is]{.mark} understood [a]{.mark}s
[partial]{.mark}]{.underline}** or complete **[[reduction of
arms]{.underline}]{.mark}** and armed forces. **[Disarmament [in a
broader sense]{.mark} of the word [also includes other measures
which]{.mark} are not directly disarmament in their character [but serve
to reduction or other modification of armament, arms spreading, their
testing]{.mark}]{.underline}** etc. Disarmament is generally based on
political aspects.

**[On the other hand the main objective of the Humanitarian Law in the
broader sense of the word is the protection of victims of armed
conflicts]{.underline}**, prohibition of certain specific methods and
means of warfare etc. **[There are several international treaties that
contain disarmament and humanitarian aspects]{.underline}** The Chemical
Weapons Convention of 1993, Anti-Personnel Landmines Convention of 1997,
Convention on Cluster Munitions of 2008. Certain elements of both areas
of international law are contained in The Biological Weapons Convention
of 1972 (disarmament treaty) and The Convention on Certain Conventional
Weapons of 1980 (treaty in the Humanitarian Law area). Concerning the
prohibition of arms **[[the best solution is a complete prohibition of
arms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, **[[only the complete
ban]{.underline}]{.mark}** of anti-personnel mines **[[can prevent the
indiscriminate effects]{.underline}]{.mark}** of these mines **[[and
their long-term destructive effects]{.mark} on civilian
population.]{.underline}**

### Reasons to Prefer \-\-- Mixes Burdens \-\-- 2AC

#### 

#### Mixes burdens \-\-- prohibition is the only legal standard that actually bans sales without mixing burdens by having to have a debate about how much is actually reduced

### Reasons to Prefer \-\-- No Ground loss \-\-- 2AC (Don't read the 1AC cards)

#### No ground loss -- 

#### 1AC Cliff \-\-- decrease arms to countries who participate in trafficking of illicit weapons

**[[illicit trade of these weapons is global.]{.underline}]{.mark}** And
**[[the activity of traffickers undermines the security of most states
in the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

This is why we believe the **[international community should tackle
illicit trafficking from both its technical aspects and the human
consequences under an approach of shared responsibility]{.underline}**.
In the past two decades **[[international community has adopted measures
and established mechanism to prevent and eradicate]{.mark} trafficking
of [these weapons, including]{.mark}]{.underline}** the Palermo
Protocol, the problem of action, most recently **[[the
ATT]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and as well as unilateral efforts by OAS and
ECOWAS.

#### 1AC Marwah \-\-- decrease arms to the Middle East 

**[The UN human rights chief has accused the Saudi-led coalition of
causing twice as many civilian casualties as all the other forces
fighting in Yemen.]{.underline}**

**[Selling arms to perpetrators of such actions]{.underline}** could
**[make]{.underline}** states including Germany**[, [Bulgaria]{.mark},
[Romania]{.mark}, [Finland]{.mark}, [Norway]{.mark}, [Italy]{.mark},
[Spain]{.mark}, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,]{.underline}** and
the United Kingdom **[complicit in war crimes; they [are clearly not
meeting]{.mark}]{.underline}** some of **[[their legal obligations under
the ATT.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### 1AC Beri \-\-- decrease arms to Somalia and other African nations

[Another important factor could be the very nature of states in
Africa.1]{.underline}7 Most of the counter measures to deal with
terrorism have dealt with enhancing the capacities of the states in the
continent. However, this has proved to be counterproductive in some
cases, as greed and corruption overwhelmed feelings of nationalism
amongst section of political elites. [For example, it has been reported
that [in Somalia]{.mark} the [arms]{.mark} [transfers from the US found
their way to al Shabaab due **to corruption in the ranks of the Somali
National Army.**]{.mark}**18** Similarly, there are reports that suggest
that Boko Haram may have supporters within the state structures in
Nigeria, particularly in North Nigeria.19]{.underline}

[There is no doubt that **[terrorism is a global problem]{.mark} and
countries across the world including India have for decades suffered
from this scourge.** While the rise in terrorism in Africa may not
impact India directly, [there is no denying the fact that this may not
remain the case in future]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, recent revival of
piracy off Somalia's northern coast, an area often used by al Shabaab,
has reopened the old debate of possible connections between al Shabaab,
AQAP and the pirates.20 The fact that the pirates hijacked an India
dhow, adds to the vulnerability for the country.21 Second, as Nigeria is
India's largest trading partner in Africa, Boko Haram's continued
attacks in the country makes it an issue of concern for India too. At
the Third India Africa Forum Summit in 2015, and during Prime Minister
Narendra Modi's visit to Kenya and South Africa in 2016, the issue of
cooperation in counter-terrorism was raised. As African countries look
towards the international community in their fight against terrorism,
friendly support from India will go a long way in taking the
relationship forward.

#### 1AC Schleicher \-\-- decrease arms to Latin American nations

**[[Because the escalation of violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** and abuse
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** these **[[Latin American]{.mark} countries
has fueled the current migrant crisis]{.underline}**, **[it is
likely]{.underline}** that **[[US efforts to]{.mark}
[deregulate]{.mark}]{.underline}** its **[[international arms
trade]{.mark} and to increase arms sales will contribute to a further
[escalat]{.mark}]{.underline}**ion **[of [the migration crisis in
Central America and Mexico]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Parallel
situations]{.mark} have occurred in Libya, Afghanistan, and Syria,
[suggest]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** that further **[[deregulation of the
US arms]{.mark} trade [will]{.mark} be a source of
[increas]{.mark}]{.underline}**ing **[[instability
globally]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not just in Latin America.

So, **[why does]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[continue
to]{.underline}** operate in ways which are likely to **[undermine
its]{.underline}** long-term **[national security
objectives]{.underline}**? **[The answer is]{.underline}** alluded to in
the previous reference to Trump's NRA speech: **[domestic
politics]{.underline}**. **[It is not an accident that the President
chose]{.underline}** **[this venue to sign his executive
order]{.underline}** withdrawing the US from the ATT. In international
organizations, domestic politics remains the strongest indicators of a
states' compliance with agreements. **[The NRA and other opponents of
the ATT have historically wielded significant political power in
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
The NRA, one of the strongest lobbying groups in the US, spent over \$36
million on the Trump campaign in 2016, breaking its previous records for
campaign spending. **[There were]{.underline}** also allegations that
the group illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign to maximize the
value of expenditures on ads and to avoid repetitive efforts. President
Trump has responded to this support by heavily supporting the NRA, even
going so far as to attack the New York attorney general's office this
week for "illegally" investigating the NRA.

**[The Administration's]{.underline}** wholehearted **[acceptance of the
NRA's views]{.underline}** on this issue **[are
unfortunate]{.underline}**, **[because]{.underline}**
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rms
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty,
while imperfect, **[[provided]{.mark} [an international framework which
could help to resolve]{.mark} the]{.underline}** previously mentioned
**[[migration crises and]{.underline}]{.mark}** to **[[reduce the risks
posed to US national security by unregulated]{.mark} international [arms
sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, despite likely failure, **[active
efforts must be made to bring the US into closer compliance with the
agreed upon principles of the treaty.]{.underline}**

**[[Education in i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw]{.underline}** will
also **[contribute to [promote public awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[for monitoring the compliance with rules]{.mark} [of
i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw]{.underline}**, conventional or
customary, by government. Considering that international activities are
currently regulated by many treaties, **[ensuring compliance
with]{.underline}** these **[treaties is of central importance in order
to maintain peace and security and to promote international cooperation
in the international community. [Given]{.mark} that there is [no
centralized machinery for securing compliance with rules of
i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw in the international community,
ultimately [public pressure remains the only real power to require
government to ensure compliance]{.mark} with rules of international law
in practice]{.underline}**.8 In this sense, the enhancement of public
awareness concerning compliance with the rules of international law is
one of the important purposes of international law education.9 It would
follow that **[more attention should be focused]{.underline}** on the
role of the teaching of **[international law in higher institutions as a
medium for promoting public awareness and education
[concerning]{.mark}]{.underline}** the rules of international law
provided for in various **[[treaties]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This
viewpoint is increasingly important since there are growing concerns
that unilateral use of force by States produces a scepticism concerning
the efficacy of international law]{.underline}**.10

Against this background, this study will explore the role of the
teaching of international law as a medium for effectuating the
obligation to promote public education in relevant treaties. To
illustrate this, the focus will be mainly on international humanitarian
law, the protection of the environment, and the protection of human
rights.11

II\. International humanitarian law

International humanitarian law will provide a clear example for
discussion with regard to the subject of this study. In this respect, it
is important to note that four Geneva Conventions of 1949 as well as the
1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions place an explicit
obligation upon the contracting parties to disseminate the text of the
Conventions and to promote study of this discipline.12 For instance,
Article 144 of the Geneva Convention in relation to the Protection of
Civilian Persons in Time of War provides that:

The High Contracting Parties undertake, in time of peace as in time of
war, to disseminate the text of the present Convention as widely as
possible in their respective countries, and, in particular, to include
the study thereof in their programmes of military and, if possible,
civil instruction, so that the principles thereof may become known to
the entire population.

A similar provision may be detected in the 1954 Convention for the
Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Article
25).

**[Considering that [breaches of i]{.mark}nternational
[h]{.mark}umanitarian [l]{.mark}aw [often derive from poor knowledge of
the Geneva Conventions]{.mark}, it is arguable that adequate knowledge
of these Conventions is a prerequisite in order to enhance the efficacy
of that law]{.underline}**.13 Obviously w**[arfare combatants as well as
military authority must be acquainted with rules of international
humanitarian law embodied in the 1949 Geneva Conventions]{.underline}**
as well as the Additional Protocols in military instruction.14 In fact,
Article 83(2) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I stipulates that:

Any military or civilian authorities who, in time of armed conflict,
assume responsibilities in respect of the application of the Conventions
and this Protocol shall be fully acquainted with the text thereof.

Furthermore, given that civilians frequently become victims of the
breach of international humanitarian law, it is of particular importance
that the civilian population is well informed about the basic rules of
the 1949 Geneva Conventions as well as the 1977 Additional Protocols[.
**[It is]{.underline}**]{.mark} also **[[necessary that]{.mark}
political [leaders as well as decision-makers are familiar with that law
so that they are aware of the rules of i]{.mark}nternational
[l]{.mark}aw [in armed conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}**15 Thus it may
be said that the dissemination and study of the Geneva Conventions are
of central importance in enhancing compliance with the Conventions.

In reality, it would seem that rules of the Geneva Conventions are not
yet well known. In fact, according to the 'People on War Report' of
1999, **[only 39% of respondents in the war-torn countries have heard of
the Geneva Conventions, compared with 51% of respondents who have not.16
Furthermore, while 66% of respondents in the four permanent members of
the UN Security Council surveyed]{.underline}** (United Kingdom, United
States, France and Russian Federation) **[have heard of the Geneva
Conventions, approximately 31% have not]{.underline}**.17 While
knowledge of the Geneva Conventions does not automatically guarantee
compliance with international humanitarian law, there is little doubt
that the lack of knowledge of these Conventions will undermine the
effective implementation of the law. Accordingly, **[further efforts
should be made to disseminate knowledge of the rules of the Geneva
Conventions]{.underline}**. To this end, the teaching of international
law, including international humanitarian law, in higher education has a
fundamental role to play in promoting understanding by civilians with
respect to the Geneva Conventions as well as the Additional Protocols.

In this regard, it can be observed that there were positive developments
in some countries. For instance, it is reported that most of the Indian
universities have included international humanitarian law in their
undergraduate LLB programmes following the recommendations of the
Association of Indian Universities in May 1998.18 While approximately 30
universities offer postgraduate courses in international law in India,
around 20 universities offer a full optional course in international
humanitarian law.19

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has also been
promoting the teaching of international humanitarian law at universities
since the early 1990s.20 In particular, after the break-up of the USSR
in 1991, four countries of Central Asia which became independent States
-- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- had to train
their own diplomats as well as public officials. Thus the ICRC offered
to start developing the teaching of international humanitarian law at
universities in these countries.21 Specifically a dissemination
programme of the ICRC includes:

● training academic staff for the teaching of international humanitarian
law;

● supporting publications and research;

● including international humanitarian law in university curricula; and

● developing knowledge of and interest in international humanitarian law
among university students.22

Consequently, in Central Asia, Turkmenistan became the first country
where international humanitarian law has become a compulsory course in
the faculties of law, international relations and journalism.23

**[[Given]{.mark} that [the]{.mark}re are [many armed conflicts in the
world, it is welcome that i]{.mark}nternational [h]{.mark}umanitarian
[l]{.mark}aw [is increasingly incorporated into]{.mark} the curriculum
in [higher education]{.mark}.]{.underline}** At the same time, it should
be noted that international humanitarian law or law of war is one of the
oldest fields of international law; and that rules of international
humanitarian law are deeply rooted in the development of public
international law in general. Hence, some basic understanding of
international law becomes a prerequisite in order to properly understand
relevant rules of international humanitarian law.24

In fact, **[international humanitarian law is closely interlinked with
other issues of international law, such as international criminal law,
the protection of human rights and the maintenance of international
peace and security]{.underline}**. For example, it is acknowledged that
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)25
and the International Criminal Court shall have jurisdiction in respect
of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.26 Furthermore, the
interrelationship between international humanitarian law and the
protection of human rights has been the subject of extensive
discussion.27 In relation to this, it should be recalled that UN General
Assembly Resolution 2852 (XXVI) called upon all States to provide
instruction concerning human rights in armed conflicts.28 Concerning the
linkage between international humanitarian law and international peace
and security, one will note with interest that UN Security Council
Resolution 827 expressed '**[its grave alarm at continuing reports of
widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law
occurring]{.underline}** within the territory of the former Yugoslavia,
and especially in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina'.29 Thus the UN
Security Council determined that this situation continued to constitute
'a threat to international peace and security'.30 Similarly, concerning
the situation in Rwanda, the UN Security Council expressed 'its grave
concern at the reports indicating that genocide and other systematic,
widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law
have been committed in Rwanda'.31 The Security Council then determined
that this situation continued to constitute 'a threat to international
peace and security'.32 Importantly, these resolutions made it clear that
**[violations of international humanitarian law and the threat to
international peace and security were intimately
intertwined]{.underline}**. It would follow that special attention
should be paid to the interaction between humanitarian law and the
maintenance of international peace and security, which is the
fundamental purpose of international law.

In conclusion, it may be argued that there is a need to teach
international humanitarian law on the basis of a solid background in
international law in general.33 To this end, further cooperation between
developed and developing countries will be required in the teaching of
international law in general. In this regard, it must be recalled that
the Annex to the UN General Assembly Resolution 45/40 encouraged

co-operation among developing countries, as well as between developed
and developing countries, in particular among those persons who are
involved in the practice of international law, for exchanging experience
and for mutual assistance in the field of international law, including
assistance in providing textbooks and manuals of international law.34

**[[SALW transfers span officially sanctioned transactions]{.mark} and
those conducted extralegally, often [in violation of arms
embargoes]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Here **[[grey zones have
widened]{.mark}, with initial transfer authorisations siphoned into
irregular transactions winding towards final
destinations.]{.underline}** Here **[brokers may forge or falsify
end-user certificates, while [governments utilise]{.mark} these
[twilight zones to supply SALW]{.mark} to armed non-state actors.
[Facilitating such loopholes is the lack of an agreed, universally
enforced set of standards capable of verifying all authorised arms
flows]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

State suppliers have acted without restraint following **[substantial
regime or systemwide international political changes]{.underline}**.
These advantages were exploited by suppliers in the former Warsaw Pact
and Albania following the Soviet Union's collapse amidst a concluding
Cold War. **[Ukraine is a good example, where immediate economic need,
strong demand and large quantities of surplus stocks facilitated major
transactions]{.underline}**.11 **[By complex routes, these [flows
supplied militias and insurgencies]{.mark} across the Middle East, the
Balkans and the Sahel]{.underline}**, often the relatively cheap,
reliable and long-lasting AK-47 assault rifle. Transfers may also
encompass non-permanent rentals provided by **[privately run, [weapons
loaning services]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They, too, **[seek out and
[exploit loopholes]{.mark} that avoid formal controls]{.underline}**.12
**[[Central to most transfers]{.mark} [are]{.mark} key functions
performed by [unevenly regulated arms sales]{.mark}
brokers.]{.underline}**

### No enforcement

#### Enforcement of embargos fail \-\-- international cooperation key to prevent illegal smuggling and institutionalized corruption

**[[While]{.mark} invoking arms [embargoes is generally]{.mark} [thought
to decrease]{.mark} the loss of human life by controlling [access to
weapons, ammunition]{.mark}, and associated arms parts, few
[empirical]{.mark} [studies]{.mark} exist to document their
effectiveness]{.underline}** (Erickson, 2013). **[Instead, the available
literature [paint]{.mark}s [a]{.mark} complex [picture of globalized
illegal smuggling and institutionalized
corruption]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, **[smart [sanctions can
be bypassed]{.mark} with weapons labeled as "humanitarian aid" or simply
[by counterfeiting shipping paperwork]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Kinsella,
2006). As one can quickly see from the review of documents from the UN
specifically pertaining to the conflict in 17 Sierra Leone,
**[[the]{.mark} UN [Security]{.mark} [Council is reliant on states as
self-regulators]{.mark} using committees that tend to have failed to
follow-up on resolutions]{.underline}** (S/RES/1270, 1999). Research
shows that **[there is some form of compliance with the embargoes but to
what degree that compliance is achieved is still debated among
scholars]{.underline}** (Bresson-Cartier, 1997; Tierney, 2005; Moore,
2010; Erickson, 2013). Erickson found that the partial embargo was more
effective than an embargo that was just a blanket of all trade
restrictions (Erikson, 2013). Even that doesn't fully tell one what the
embargo is doing to change the network. The question addressed here
becomes if one knows that the embargo is only somewhat effective, then
how are trade patterns changing that allow the flow of weapons to still
enter the sanctioned areas? In this study, we examine other variables
that could contribute to the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of
embargoes. **[Obviously, in some cases the UN and other government
agencies are well aware that [bordering states can facilitate]{.mark}
[illegal]{.mark} weapons [transfer]{.mark} allowing arms [to reach
sanctioned states]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Tierney, 2005; Bichler &
Franquez, 2014). **[Other important factors in that affect the flow of
arms and the willingness of nation states to comply with a current
embargo include corruption and GDP as stated by
Bresson-Cartier]{.underline}** (Bresson-Cartier, 1997).

#### Conflict deters the ability to enforce of an embargo \-\-- gray and black market circumvents

Importantly, **[[countries]{.mark} that are coming [out of]{.mark} a
[conflict]{.mark} may [find]{.mark} that [they lack the funds to rebuild
infrastructure]{.mark} [and]{.mark} so [turn]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
most viable commodity that they now have available, which may be
[stockpiles of weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bichler & Franquez,
2014). Bichler and Franquez discovered that the likelihood that trade
would increase was 81% immediately following the end of a conflict
(2014). **[This uncovers gateways [which]{.mark} could [facilitate the
transfer of legal weapons into the gray or black market]{.mark},
[if]{.mark} the [weapons]{.mark} then [continue to be traded
illegally]{.mark}. In this respect, weapon [stockpiles are a national
commodity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bichler and Franquez, 2014). Auditing
weapon stockpiles may be a promising strategy to strengthen weapons
controls. Thus, instead of trying to completely stop illicit arms
trade**[, perhaps a more successful strategy would be to examine
sanction behaviors]{.underline}** rather than looking for the secession
of all trade**[. Although this shows great 19 promise]{.underline}** for
embargoes thereby decreasing the loss of human life and suffering**[,
one must ask what additional factors may contribute to the willingness
of certain countries to comply with arms embargoes compared to those
that do not.]{.underline}**

#### Relations maintain illicit trades post-embargo

<https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b1d2/3fd2113f0965761468c9f19cc23fd3051774.pdf>

In previous research**[, [a]{.mark} [country's]{.mark}
[political]{.mark} [standing]{.mark} was found to [influence]{.mark}
[whether a particular country chose to trade and whether or not]{.mark}
that country was willing to violate sanctions in order to maintain a
trading relationship]{.underline}** (BressonCartier, 1997; Akerman and
Seim, 2014). **[[Countries that share land borders or have long-standing
relationships]{.mark}, such as colonial ties, [are more likely to
continue]{.mark} to [trade]{.mark} with one another]{.underline}**
(Moore, 2010; Akerman and Seim, 2014). Interestingly, **[the political
standing of a country was found to have the highest effect on the choice
of whether to trade with another country. [Simply]{.mark} [implementing
an embargo was]{.mark} [not enough to change the political landscape of
a country]{.mark} [or]{.mark} their [willingness]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
discontinue what may have been a long-standing geo-political
relationship. Other important factors that play a role in the
willingness to [comply]{.mark} [with]{.mark} a [sanction]{.mark} include
the level of a corruption in the government.]{.underline}**

Bresson-Cartier found that these **[long-established relationships play
a major role in a country's, nations, or territory's motivation to
comply with the rules and to turn in those that are willing to break the
rules]{.underline}** (Bresson-Cartier, 1997). **[[Once]{.mark} the level
of [corruption]{.mark} [increases]{.mark} in a country, [sanctions no
longer become a factor]{.mark} in the decision-making process to
illegally trade with another country, state or territory]{.underline}**.
Bresson-Cartier states that **[the [risk]{.mark} [for]{.mark} illegal
[trading]{.mark} [does not]{.mark} 20 [outweigh]{.mark} the
[benefits]{.mark} of the long-term relationship]{.underline}**
(Bresson-Cartier, 1997). This can also be applied to the motivation to
turn in one's "friend"- the short-term benefit does not outweigh the
benefits to a continued relationship. Moore (2010) used a two-step
modeling approach, using maximum-likelihood and ordinary least squares
(OLS), to model the decision-making process on whether or not to
transfer arms and the size of a transfer. **[Moore states that these
decisions are crucial in understanding why states are willing to violate
sanctions, because he found that small transfers to embargoed states
seem like less of a violation than large transfers]{.underline}**:
Active embargoes reduce the size of shipments, but weapons continue to
flow into the sanctioned areas.

In sum, studies find some evidence that **[although embargoes have some
effect, illegal trade continues]{.underline}** (Moore, 2010; Erickson,
2013). Given the complexity of global illegal markets, and the
interconnections between nations formed by long-term relations and
alliances, mapping how trade patterns are influenced by embargos
requires a dynamic analysis of the evolution of trade behavior.

### Alt Causes 

#### Embargo's fail---too many alt causes

Rachel **Stohl** 20**04**, Managing Director and directs the
Conventional Defense Program, "The Tangled Web of Illicit Arms
Trafficking", October 21^st^ 2004,
https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/kf/TerrorinShadows-Stohl.pdf

[The vast majority of small arms on the black market were produced and
traded legally before being diverted into an illicit
network]{.underline}. There are seven primary ways in which this
diversion occurs.

[The first and most direct method of diversion involves **shipping
legally produced weapons directly to and through debarred
countries.**]{.underline} The U.N. sanctions panel on Angola and Liberia
found **[numerous violations of arms embargoes, both by supplier states
and those that allowed weapons to be transshipped through their
countries]{.underline}**.40 **[Government officials accept bribes in
exchange for export licenses for ineligible parties and other
services.]{.underline}** Cash payouts are particularly common in
countries where government workers receive meager salaries or do not
receive regular wages.

[Second, **poor stockpile security and management** make government
arsenals attractive to thieves and vulnerable to accidental loss**.**
Weapons can flow from insecure government stockpiles into the hands of
unscrupulous arms dealers or end up in the hands of organized crime
syndicates, terrorists, or rebel groups.]{.underline}

[Third, national **arsenals can be looted during times of
instability**]{.underline}. For instance, in 1997, over half a million
weapons were stolen from the Albanian national arsenal. [These weapons
quickly spread throughout the Balkans and beyond.]{.underline}

[Fourth, **weapons are sometimes simply lost by the government or
military**. From the United States to the Philippines, weapons are
accidentally misplaced or unaccounted for. An estimated one million
small arms are stolen or lost worldwide each year]{.underline}.41 These
weapons often end up on the black market.

[Fifth, **soldiers may sell weapons for cash**. In countries where
military personnel have not been paid, surplus weapons have not been
collected from military stocks, or soldiers have sympathies to a rebel
cause, weapons may be sold for cash.]{.underline} There are documented
cases of Israeli military officers selling weapons to Palestinian
fighters with full knowledge that these weapons were likely to be used
against them.

[Sixth**, weapons are often stolen from both legitimate and illegal
civilian owners**. Known gun owners are attractive targets for those
trying to get their hands on weapons quickly]{.underline}. Small-scale
burglary alone enables half a million U.S. weapons to enter the black
market every year.42

### Follow On Undermines the ATT

#### Major Powers staying out of the ATT undermines its effectiveness

**[The Economist 2018]{.underline}**, Liberal Economic Magazine,
8/18/18, "A UN Treaty to Regulate the Global Arms Trade has Little
Impact",
https://www.economist.com/international/2018/08/18/a-un-treaty-to-regulate-the-global-arms-trade-has-little-impact

**[[IF ALL---or even most---countries abided by
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** letter and spirit of the **[UN Arms Trade
Treaty ([ATT), the world might be rather less grim. Governments that
sign up are supposed to halt exports of weapons if they have good reason
to think they will be used to flout i]{.mark}nternational
[h]{.mark}umanitarian [l]{.mark}aw.]{.underline}** **[[That could cover
both internal repression and waging wars by inhumane
methods.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Every country in the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [has ratified
the treaty]{.mark};]{.underline}** when it was being crafted, **[Britain
was a keen advocate. But Russia and China have stayed out. [The American
administration]{.mark}]{.underline}** (under Barack Obama) **[[inked the
accord, but it has yet to be ratified by the Senate]{.mark} and this
looks unlikely to happen.]{.underline}** **[[The treaty]{.mark}, which
covers everything from tanks to small arms, [was opposed by America's
gun lobby]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Conservative [critics]{.mark} in
Washington, DC, [now call it a piece of liberal Utopianism which would
hobble America without reining in its main
rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[[The fear of hobbling may be exaggerated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A
year ago, the High Court in London disappointed anti-war campaigners. It
ruled that Britain's deliveries of weaponry to Saudi Arabia were not in
violation of the treaty, despite the terrible civilian casualties in
Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting an Iranian-backed one.
NGOs that brought the case have pledged to fight on, and were recently
given the right to appeal.

The court ruling focused on a narrow question: whether at the time he
gave his approval, the trade minister had reason to think that
British-made weapons would be used to perpetrate atrocities. Much of the
hearing was conducted in secret. **[But in their open arguments, lawyers
for the government stressed the close relations between British and
Saudi militaries, which enabled Britain to have some say in the
selection of targ]{.underline}**ets. Whether that improves Britain's
moral standing or makes it seem even worse is, of course, a matter of
opinion.

**[Canada was an unlikely absentee from the accord]{.underline}**. But
in a careful pronouncement last February, its foreign minister, Chrystia
Freeland, promised legislation that would pave the way for her country
to join. Critics said there was a loophole. Canadian-made weapons or
parts could still be shipped to America and thence who knows where. The
bill is still being picked over by parliamentarians in Ottawa.

**[[No Western country wants its weapons used to harm Yemeni civilians,
and most democracies crave the respectability that goes with signing up
to the ATT. But many balk at breaking ties]{.mark} with the [lucrative
arms markets]{.mark} of the Gulf.]{.underline}**

#### Russia and China are needed to promote ATT effectiveness\-\--Failure of these major powers ensures that the illicit arms trade continues

Joshua D **[Sorenson 15]{.underline}**, 8/1/15, "United Nations Arms
Trade Treaty: Russia's justification for abstentationand the treaty's
effectiveness in application" Brigham Young University International Law
and Management Review,
<https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=ilmr>

Though there may be reason to question the ATT's potential effectiveness
in its application, **[[the ATT may still be a step in the right
direction. Several things,]{.mark} however, [cut against the ATT's
likely success in fully achieving its goal to curb arms being used in
the commission of genocides]{.mark} and other atrocitie]{.underline}**s.
First, **[[Russia and]{.mark} other key states, such as [China, are not
parties to the treaty.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Second, the treaty's text
has large gaps, such as its failure to address the transfer of arms to
non-state actors. Lastly, interests of individual Member State parties
will subjugate the ATT's goals. **[First, [many States]{.mark},
including Russia, [either rejected the ATT or abstained from
joining]{.mark} i]{.underline}**t.133 Additionally, the majority of the
States who are signatories to the ATT have not yet ratified it and may
avoid ratifying the treaty altogether.134 **[Just as [various countries
thought it unwise to join the treaty when the largest producer and
seller of weapons was rejecting the treaty,]{.mark}135 [it may be unwise
to think the treaty will be effective when the second largest producer
and seller is not party to the treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The
more countries that do not feel compelled to abide by the
ATT]{.mark}---either because they are not party to the treaty or because
they do not feel obligated---[will equate to more arms transfers
occurring outside the confines of the ATT.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Nic
Marsh of the Peace Research Institute Oslo136 stated, "**[[Having the
abstentions from two major arms exporters lessens the moral weight of
the treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}** . . . . **[By abstaining they have
left their options open."137 Moreover, some of the Member States that
most needed to join the treaty did not.]{.underline}** Skeptics contend
that the ATT will experience the same fate as the Convention on Cluster
Munitions (CCM), which prohibited "the use, transfer and stockpiling of
cluster bombs."138 In the case of the CCM, States that had never made
cluster bombs readily signed the treaty, while States that made and
possessed cluster bombs did not sign the treaty.139 The United States,
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and Sweden have all
ratified the ATT. **[However, Russia, with a quarter of global arms
sales, and China, with another five percent of global sales, have
neither signed nor ratified the treat]{.underline}**y.140 Several major
arms importers, including India, Pakistan, South Korea, and Singapore,
have avoided ratifying the treaty as well.141 **[Further, of the
twenty-three countries that abstained, many have the kind of human
rights records that the ATT is designed to prevent]{.underline}**.142

More than anything else, the ATT regulates the export of weapons. [With
the U.S. currently holding the distinction of being the world's largest
arms exporter, it is in its best interests to accurately identify and
track exactly where its weapons exports are going]{.underline}. The U.S.
has long since understood the importance of this issue, which is why
they have had domestic measures to meet this goal---such as restrictions
on re-transfer of arms sold abroad and end-user checks---in place for
some time. The "boomerang effect," where weapons produced in the U.S.
end up being used against U.S. personnel on the ground, is an important
part of the national security side of this debate. Barbara Frey,
Director of the Human Rights Program at the University of Minnesota and
former Special Rapporteur to the UN Sub-Commission on the issue of
preventing human rights abuses committed with small arms, further points
out that the latest estimates suggest there are currently 650 million
firearms in civilian possession, including 2-10 million in the hands of
gangs, and 1.1-1.8 million more in the possession of non-state armed
groups. 6 ["It really matters what governments do with their weapons,\"
says Frey. Accordingly, the emphasis [the ATT places]{.mark} on
[cooperation between nations]{.mark} who have ratified the treaty
[will]{.mark} help [eliminate gray areas]{.mark} that arise from export
destinations that may present risk]{.underline}. [The ATT calls for
information sharing on things like international trafficking routes,
illicit brokers, and methods of concealment. 7 [In ratifying the
ATT]{.mark} and solidifying this commitment for the international
community, [the U.S. would]{.mark} not only increase the group's
capacity to collect this important information, but also [strengthen
its]{.mark} own argument and [ability to **draw** ]{.mark}**other
hesitant [nations such as China and Russia into compliance with the
treaty]{.mark}**.]{.underline} With today's ever-changing geopolitical
situation[, [the flow of arms from China]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
Pakistan (accounting for 55% of Chinese arms exports), Myanmar, or
Venezuela is something that, if left unregulated by an international
mechanism, **[represents a]{.mark} real [cost to U.S.]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}.** 8 Without ratifying the document itself, the U.S.
will fall short in its argument with fellow large-scale arms export
States whose interests do not always align with its own.]{.underline}
The transparency provided by mandatory national records on arms exports,
stipulated in Article 12 of the ATT, is an invaluable asset to the
international community, requiring those who join the treaty to take
responsibility for arms leaving their territory. 9 Globalization has
changed the way the world interacts and conducts exchange. In
particular, the developing States' interactions 7 and exchanges with
developed States have been slow or resistant to regulation largely due
to rampant corruption in the developing world. [[The]{.mark}
[U.S.]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [set]{.mark} the gold [standard]{.mark} when
it comes to keeping and reporting export data with or [without]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [ATT]{.mark}, but there are many nations around the world
who do not do [so]{.mark}, [nations]{.mark} that [won't]{.mark} even
[discuss]{.mark} [joining]{.mark} the treaty [until]{.mark}
[movement]{.mark} on the issue [is]{.mark} [seen]{.mark} from the United
States. [If the U.S. joins]{.mark} and strengthens the regulatory group
that will emerge when the treaty comes into force, then the opportunity
to [help]{.mark} quell violence in a variety of hot spots around the
world, from the Middle East to Central Africa[, increases
significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reality is that today there can
be no global norm without the participation of the U.S. and the
legitimacy that comes with that participation[. U.S.
[ratification]{.mark} will not attract every country in the world, but
there [will]{.mark} undoubtedly [be]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [domino]{.mark}
[effect]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the strength of this treaty comes from the
transparency these States then must provide on their arms sales. If the
U.S. is looking to [maintain]{.mark} its ability to oversee and
appropriately punish countries for illicit activity through
[international]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark} such as the UN, it cannot
turn its back on one of the mechanisms it helped this body create to
regulate such activity]{.underline}. The ATT is not unique as a treaty
with arms control goals that the United States has not ratified. For
example, the domestic political fight over ratifying the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), another treaty with broad global
support, is still being fought in the U.S. However, a better example of
the world coming together to create an international mechanism already
paying dividends is the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Since its
inception in April 1997, the norms created by the CWC have led to a
marked decrease in the production and proliferation of chemical weapons
around the world, including the ongoing removal of chemical weapons from
Syria. The outcome and goals of the CWC are different from the basic
regulation of arms sales that the ATT seeks, but it nonetheless is an
example of the international community, including full participation of
and ratification by the United States, working collaboratively to create
a mechanism and universal norms by which States around the world operate
to increase collective security. These types of victories for that
collective security can undoubtedly be placed in the "pro" section of
the ATT debate.

### ATT key \-\-- 2AC/1AR

#### The ATT is uniquely key to multilateralism and mitigating conflict

Pablo Arrocha **[Olabuenaga 19]{.underline}**, Legal Adviser of the
Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations, 5/8/19, "Why the Arms
Trade Treaty Matters -- and Why It matters That the US is Walking Away",
Just Security,
https://www.justsecurity.org/63968/why-the-arms-trade-treaty-matters-and-why-it-matters-that-the-us-is-walking-away/

In a nutshell, **[[the ATT sets]{.mark} out [global standards to
conduct]{.mark} legal and rightful [activities in]{.mark} a [transparent
manner. This]{.mark}, in turn[, helps to identify]{.mark} where and [how
arms are diverted into the illicit market and raises]{.mark} the bar
regarding [accountability]{.mark} for irresponsible transfers of
arms.]{.underline}**

What does the ATT not do? **[It is not a disarmament treaty nor a treaty
for the reduction of arsenals; it does not prohibit the international
trade in arms, and; it does not regulate, in any way, internal
transactions]{.underline}**, **[in particular the acquisition of arms by
civilians]{.underline}**. Contrary to what Trump has declared, the
treaty explicitly reaffirms "the sovereign right of any State to
regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory,
pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system." In other words, the
ATT is absolutely silent on controls, regulations, limitations, rights
or obligations regarding the domestic sale of arms. Therefore, claiming
that the ATT breaches sovereign rights of States, specifically the
second amendment to the U.S. Constitution, is not a matter of
misinterpretation: It is simply not true.

It is also very important to understand what is the extent of the legal
obligations arising from signing the ATT. A signatory to an
international treaty is not a State Party. According to Article 18 of
the [Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties](http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf)(VCLT)
of 1969, a State that has signed a treaty has the obligation to refrain
from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of said treaty. No
more and no less. The signature does not unfold the totality of the
rights and obligations established in the treaty. This would only happen
if the State became a party, having expressed its consent to be bound,
namely through ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.

It is also worth noting that there is no such thing as a revocation of
signature of treaties in the VCLT. However, the obligation not to defeat
the object and purpose of a treaty arising from its signature lasts
until the State has made its intention clear not to become a party to
the treaty, which presumably will be the case of the ATT (as of the time
of writing of this essay, no notification in this regard has been
deposited by the U.S. before the U.N. Treaty Section, which serves as
depositary of the Treaty).

A historic achievement of multilateralism

The adoption of the ATT was widely praised, and rightly so. Following
the adoption of the ATT, the U.N. issued a [press
release](https://www.un.org/press/en/2013/ga11354.doc.htm) stating:

**["To a burst of sustained applause, the General Assembly today voted
overwhelmingly in favour of a "historic", first-ever treaty to regulate
the astonishing number of conventional weapons traded each year, making
it more difficult for them to be diverted into the hands of those intent
on sowing the seeds of war and conflict."]{.underline}**

The President of the Final UN Conference, Amb. Woolcott, wrote:

"The UN had not seen success in negotiating a multilateral arms control
agreement since the 1990s. **[The [adoption of the Treaty by]{.mark} an
overwhelming [majority of States]{.mark} in the UN General Assembly
[is]{.mark} a major [achievement for the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations
[and]{.mark} for [multilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When the
Treaty's regular Conference of States Parties takes hold, it will
underscore that the discussion and scrutiny of the international arms
trade have firmly found a place on the multilateral agenda."
(Introduction to the book Weapons and international law: The Arms Trade
Treaty, 2015)

Finally, In the preface to the book Le Traite sur le Commerce des
Armes by Loïc Simonet, Dr. Óscar Arias wrote:

"...I am both proud and deeply relieved that as I write these words in
October 2014, we have defied the odds. We have made history. The Arms
Trade Treaty was adopted on 2nd April 2013 by a large majority of the UN
General Assembly. (...) As we look back on our history of violence, we
took a powerful step towards peace. For the first time in history, a
legally binding instrument established a common regulatory framework for
international transfers of conventional arms, and therefore set up
universal legal standards for the arms trade, on one of the few areas of
global commerce which had escaped any control until now. **[The [treaty
has]{.mark} the [power to reduce]{.mark} human [suffering and contribute
to]{.mark} international [peace, security and
stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To be honest, it is an achievement I
never expected to witness. I never thought that an idea that first took
shape so many years ago would become a part of international law in my
lifetime."

**[Given the great difficulties it encompassed as well as the great real
impact it can have on the ground in reducing human suffering, the
adoption of the ATT was indeed a historical achievement of the
international community]{.underline}**. It also reaffirmed the relevance
of the United Nations and multilateral diplomacy, in particular in an
area as controversial as the regulation of conventional arms, and in
which no progress had been registered for so many years.

**[According to [Amnesty
International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/gun-violence/),
more than 500 people die every day from gun violence, 44 percent of all
killings globally involve gun violence, and there were over 1 million
firearm-related deaths globally between 2012 and 2016. In contrast,
military expenditure is on the rise. According to [the Stockholm
International Peace Research
Institute](http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/toplist.php) (SIPRI),
[the U.S. continues to be the]{.mark} top [global exporter of
arms]{.mark} and the 13th global importer (with Saudi Arabia holding the
first position), with a [total military
expenditure](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) in 2018 of \$6.5
billion. This is more than 120 times the [U.N.
budget](https://unicwash.org/budget_2018-19/) for the period
2018-2019.]{.underline}**

It is for these reasons that the recent announcement to "revoke" the
U.S. signature of the ATT is so troubling. **[[The world is in]{.mark}
dire [need of]{.mark} an effective [implementation of]{.mark} the only
global [legally binding]{.mark} instrument that regulates the
international [trade in arms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And for that to
happen, **[[it is key to have]{.mark} on board [the largest
exporter]{.mark} in the world, if not as a State Party, at least [as
a]{.mark} responsible [actor committed not to undermine]{.mark} the
object and purpose of [the treaty]{.mark}, [which has]{.mark} at its
core international [peace and security]{.mark} and, most importantly,
the value of the human person]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, this
political decision, based on false premises, and coupled with a
consistent pattern of attacks on multilateral diplomacy, seems anything
but promising.

Though there may be reason to question the ATT's potential effectiveness
in its application, **[[the ATT may still be a step in the right

More than anything else, the ATT regulates the export of weapons. [With
the U.S. currently holding the distinction of being the world's largest
arms exporter, it is in its best interests to accurately identify and
track exactly where its weapons exports are going]{.underline}. The U.S.
has long since understood the importance of this issue, which is why
they have had domestic measures to meet this goal---such as restrictions
on re-transfer of arms sold abroad and end-user checks---in place for
some time. The "boomerang effect," where weapons produced in the U.S.
end up being used against U.S. personnel on the ground, is an important
part of the national security side of this debate. Barbara Frey,
Director of the Human Rights Program at the University of Minnesota and
former Special Rapporteur to the UN Sub-Commission on the issue of
preventing human rights abuses committed with small arms, further points
out that the latest estimates suggest there are currently 650 million
firearms in civilian possession, including 2-10 million in the hands of
gangs, and 1.1-1.8 million more in the possession of non-state armed
groups. 6 ["It really matters what governments do with their weapons,\"
says Frey. Accordingly, the emphasis [the ATT places]{.mark} on
[cooperation between nations]{.mark} who have ratified the treaty
[will]{.mark} help [eliminate gray areas]{.mark} that arise from export
destinations that may present risk]{.underline}. [The ATT calls for
information sharing on things like international trafficking routes,
illicit brokers, and methods of concealment. 7 [In ratifying the
ATT]{.mark} and solidifying this commitment for the international
community, [the U.S. would]{.mark} not only increase the group's
capacity to collect this important information, but also [strengthen
its]{.mark} own argument and [ability to **draw** ]{.mark}**other
hesitant [nations such as China and Russia into compliance with the
treaty]{.mark}**.]{.underline} With today's ever-changing geopolitical
situation[, [the flow of arms from China]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
Pakistan (accounting for 55% of Chinese arms exports), Myanmar, or
Venezuela is something that, if left unregulated by an international
mechanism, **[represents a]{.mark} real [cost to U.S.]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}.** 8 Without ratifying the document itself, the U.S.
will fall short in its argument with fellow large-scale arms export
States whose interests do not always align with its own.]{.underline}
The transparency provided by mandatory national records on arms exports,
stipulated in Article 12 of the ATT, is an invaluable asset to the
international community, requiring those who join the treaty to take
responsibility for arms leaving their territory. 9 Globalization has
changed the way the world interacts and conducts exchange. In
particular, the developing States' interactions 7 and exchanges with
developed States have been slow or resistant to regulation largely due
to rampant corruption in the developing world. [[The]{.mark}
[U.S.]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [set]{.mark} the gold [standard]{.mark} when
it comes to keeping and reporting export data with or [without]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [ATT]{.mark}, but there are many nations around the world
who do not do [so]{.mark}, [nations]{.mark} that [won't]{.mark} even
[discuss]{.mark} [joining]{.mark} the treaty [until]{.mark}
[movement]{.mark} on the issue [is]{.mark} [seen]{.mark} from the United
States. [If the U.S. joins]{.mark} and strengthens the regulatory group
that will emerge when the treaty comes into force, then the opportunity
to [help]{.mark} quell violence in a variety of hot spots around the
world, from the Middle East to Central Africa[, increases
significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reality is that today there can
be no global norm without the participation of the U.S. and the
legitimacy that comes with that participation[. U.S.
[ratification]{.mark} will not attract every country in the world, but
there [will]{.mark} undoubtedly [be]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [domino]{.mark}
[effect]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the strength of this treaty comes from the
transparency these States then must provide on their arms sales. If the
U.S. is looking to [maintain]{.mark} its ability to oversee and
appropriately punish countries for illicit activity through
[international]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark} such as the UN, it cannot
turn its back on one of the mechanisms it helped this body create to
regulate such activity]{.underline}. The ATT is not unique as a treaty
with arms control goals that the United States has not ratified. For
example, the domestic political fight over ratifying the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), another treaty with broad global
support, is still being fought in the U.S. However, a better example of
the world coming together to create an international mechanism already
paying dividends is the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Since its
inception in April 1997, the norms created by the CWC have led to a
marked decrease in the production and proliferation of chemical weapons
around the world, including the ongoing removal of chemical weapons from
Syria. The outcome and goals of the CWC are different from the basic
regulation of arms sales that the ATT seeks, but it nonetheless is an
example of the international community, including full participation of
and ratification by the United States, working collaboratively to create
a mechanism and universal norms by which States around the world operate
to increase collective security. These types of victories for that
collective security can undoubtedly be placed in the "pro" section of
the ATT debate.

### Permutation \-\-- 2AC

#### Perm do both \-\-- international regulations is a pre-req to regulate the dark web

Giacomo **[Persi Paoli 18]{.underline}**, Associate Research Group
Director, Defence, Security, and Infrastructure, RAND Europe,
"International arms trade on the dark web",
https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/international-arms-trade-on-the-hidden-web.html

Final Remarks and Observations

The dark web introduces a new platform enabling arms trafficking at a
global scale. Despite the relatively limited value and volume of weapons
traded on the dark web compared to either other products type (e.g.
drugs) or to equivalent products trafficked offline, the potential
impact on internal security is significant as demonstrated by recent
'lone-wolf' terrorist attacks in Europe.

**[[The]{.mark} development of the [dark web]{.mark}]{.underline}** will
**[[require policy makers]{.mark} and law enforcement agencies [to adapt
intervention strategies, ensure that proper regulatory frameworks are in
place, ensure that adequate resources are made available]{.mark} and
ensure that specialist skills are developed.]{.underline}**

**[The dark web does not produce new weapons; it merely acts as an
enabler of trafficking]{.underline}**, with weapons and ammunition
having to be shipped and delivered in the 'real world'. Therefore,
**[[good traditional policing and investigative techniques]{.mark} will
[remain vital]{.mark} in responding to this threat]{.underline}**. In
addition, **[traditional firearms control measures designed [to tackle
illicit trafficking]{.mark} remain of the outmost importance to reduce
the availability of illegal firearms. [These include efficient marking
and record keeping practices, international cooperation for tracing, and
good stockpile management]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Existing international instruments for combating arms trafficking should
not be considered obsolete. The validity of some instruments should
certainly be examined and perhaps require amendments, but the emergence
of a new threat does not necessarily require the creation of new
instruments.

The study represents the first attempt to collect and analyse primary
data related to the sale of firearms and related products on the dark
web. In order to generate a more robust understanding of the role of the
dark web in enabling arms trafficking, **[a [more continuous monitoring
activity should be implemented]{.mark}. This would involve repeating and
refining the data collection and analysis presented in this study over
time in order to generate historical data that can be used to analyse
trends. [This would also involve a more rigorous assessment of the
validity and applicability of current national and international
counter-arms trafficking regimes]{.mark}, including policies, laws and
regulations, actors and resources.]{.underline}**

### Alt Cause \-\-- 2AC

#### Seven alt causes to dark web \-\-- proves the permutation solves

consultant to the Arms Trade Treaty process, and Daniel R. Mahanty,
Director of the U.S. program at Center for Civilians in Conflict,
10/12/04, "The Tangled Web of Illicit Arms Trafficking".]{.underline}

The **[[vast majority of small arms on the black market were produced
and traded legally before being diverted into an illicit
network]{.mark}.]{.underline}** There are seven primary ways in which
this diversion occurs. **[The [first]{.mark} and most direct [method of
diversion involves shipping legally produced weapons]{.mark} directly to
and [through debarred countries.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[The U.N.
sanctions panel on Angola and Liberia found numerous violations of arms
embargoes, both by supplier states and those that allowed weapons to be
transshipped through their countries.]{.underline}**40 **[Government
officials accept bribes]{.underline}** in exchange for export licenses
for ineligible parties and other services. **[Cash payouts are
particularly common in countries where government workers receive meager
salaries or do not receive regular wages.]{.underline}** **[[Second,
poor stockpile security and management make government arsenals
attractive to thieves and vulnerable to accidental
loss]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Weapons can flow from insecure
government stockpiles into the hands]{.mark} of unscrupulous arms
dealers or end up in the hands of [o]{.mark}rganized [crime syndicates,
terrorists, or rebel groups]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Third, national
arsenals can be looted during times of
instability]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[For instance, in 1997, over half
a million weapons were stolen from the Albanian national
arsenal.]{.underline}** These weapons quickly spread throughout the
Balkans and beyond. **[[Fourth, weapons are sometimes simply lost by the
government or military]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From the United States to
the Philippines, weapons are accidentally misplaced or unaccounted for.
**[An [estimated one million small arms are stolen or lost worldwide
each year]{.mark}]{.underline}**.41 **[These weapons often end up on the
black market]{.underline}**. **[[Fifth, soldiers may sell weapons for
cash]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[In [countries where military personnel
have not been paid, surplus weapons have not been collecte]{.mark}d from
military stocks, [or soldiers have sympathies to a rebel cause, weapons
may be sold for cash]{.mark}. There are documented cases of Israeli
military officers selling weapons to Palestinian fighters with full
knowledge that these weapons were likely to be used against
them.]{.underline}** **[[Sixth, weapons are often stolen from both
legitimate and illegal civilian owners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Known gun
owners are attractive targets for those trying to get their hands on
weapons quickly. **[[Small-scale burglary alone enables half a million
U.S. weapons to enter the black market every
year]{.underline}]{.mark}**.42 **[[Seventh, domestic purchasing laws
facilitate the entrance of small arms into the illicit
market]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In countries where there are no limits to
how many guns a person may legally own or buy at one time, the
phenomenon of "straw purchasing" has become common. **[[Individuals buy
several weapons at a time and then illegally resell the weapons]{.mark},
often bringing the weapons across international borders to sell
in]{.underline}** **[countries where gun laws are more
restrictive.]{.underline}** This technique is commonplace between the
United States, Mexico, and Canada

### No solvency \-\-- 1AR

#### The CP solves for only 136 arms per month \-\-- that's .1% of the entire illicit arms market

Giacomo Persi **[Paoli 18]{.underline}**, Associate Research Group
Director, Defence, Security, and Infrastructure, RAND Europe,
"International arms trade on the dark web",
https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/international-arms-trade-on-the-hidden-web.html

The **[[overall value of the arms trade on the dark
web]{.underline}]{.mark}** based on the 12 cryptomarkets analysed in the
study **[[is estimated to be]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region of
\$80,000 USD per month, with firearms generating nearly 90 per cent of
all revenue. Due to the arms trade on the dark web, every month there
could be up to **[[136 untraced firearms]{.mark} or associated products
in the real world.]{.underline}**

**[Estimates on the value and volume of the arms trade on the dark web
may include a certain percentage of fake listings or
transactions]{.underline}**, particularly among vendors of firearms.
However, it is challenging to ascertain the extent of scamming on the
dark web.

**[[The dark web is unlikely to be the method of choice to fuel
conflicts because arms are not traded at a large enough scale and due to
the potential limitations on infrastructure and services in a conflict
zone]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the other hand, the dark web has the
potential to become the platform of choice for individuals (e.g.
lone-wolves terrorists) or small groups (e.g. gangs) to obtain weapons
and ammunition behind the anonymity curtain provided by the dark web. In
addition, the dark web could be used by vulnerable and fixated
individuals to purchase firearms.

**[The illegal arms trade presents further challenges for law
enforcement agencies and national governments. These [challenges]{.mark}
largely [derive from the anonymity of individuals that use the dark web
to purchase arms.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Arm sales on the dark web aren't common \-\-- its inefficient 

Jessica **[Hullinger 16]{.underline}**, a London-based journalist who
covers science, health, and innovation, 1/7/16, "Do People Really Buy
Guns On The Dark Web?",
https://www.fastcompany.com/3055187/do-people-really-buy-guns-on-the-dark-web

Surprisingly, Christin says that **[gun sales on the dark web are not
all that common. "[Weapons represent a very small portion of the overall
trade on anonymous marketplaces]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he says. "There
is some trade, but it is pretty much negligible." Drugs are far more
common. Specifically, MDMA and marijuana each account for about 25% of
sales on the dark web, according to Christin's research. But **[[weapons
are so uncommon that they were lumped into the "miscellaneous" category,
along with drug paraphernalia, electronics, tobacco, Viagra, and
steroids. Together those account for maybe 3% of
sales]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Back in 2012, a Silk Road sister site for weapons called the Armory shut
down a few months after launch due to lack of business. It relaunched
under new leadership, but in 2014, someone from the site told Vocativ
the Armory was making just 10 to 40 gun sales per month. In 2015,
another marketplace called Agora also stopped allowing lethal weapon
sales. There just isn't a large demand for guns on the dark web.

One reason is because **[[guns are hard to send through the
mail]{.mark}, unlike drugs, which can be easily hidden and shipped in
small quantities. [Also, the dark web is riddled with scammers who take
the buyer's money and run, never delivering a gun at
all]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Another reason people don't buy guns on the dark web]{.mark}? [They
don't need to. To acquire a gun through the black marketplace, a buyer
would actually have to jump through more hoops than they would to buy a
weapon in person.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Chritin explains: "**[[Why would you go through the hassle of purchasing
Bitcoin, logging into an anonymous marketplace, purchasing weapons from
an online dealer, and potentially going through the further hassle of
reassembling various weapon parts shipped in multiple parcels to your
house]{.mark}, when you can get these weapons legally, e.g., at a gun
show---without much of a background check]{.underline}**?"

### NonUQ and Alt Causes\-\--2AC

#### [NonUQ and Alt Causes]{.underline}\-\--Defense industrial base has been [weak for decades]{.underline} AND supply chain weaknesses and dependency [thump]{.underline}

Jeff **Green 18**, president of J.A. Green & Company, a government
relations firm based in Washington, D.C., October 5^th^, 2018, "The
decline of the defense industrial base -- and what to do about it",
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/2018/10/05/the-decline-of-the-defense-industrial-base-and-what-to-do-about-it/>

**[[A]{.mark} new [report]{.mark} released by the White House [documents
the gravity of the situation facing the defense industrial
base]{.mark}]{.underline}**, while also offering solutions to counteract
these challenges. [By evaluating **seven tiers deep** into the supply
chain, the report has documented **more than [280]{.mark} major [supply
chain vulnerabilities and]{.mark} an alarming [dependency on foreign
nations]{.mark}, especially China.**]{.underline}

The report is not all bad news, however: it notes that **[a targeted
approach involving [funding, policy, legislation, and regulation could
combat these declines]{.mark}]{.underline}** and significantly improve
the outlook for American defense production.

Keen **[[observers]{.mark} of the defense industrial base [have
noticed]{.mark} many of [the problems]{.mark} identified by the
report]{.underline}**, classified into ten different "archetypes,"
**[[for years]{.mark}. Foreign dependencies abound within the defense
[supply chain]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially at the "sub-tier"
levels of component or raw material manufacturing. Even when the U.S.
military is not entirely dependent on a foreign source for these
supplies, it is often the case **[that [a sole source]{.mark} or a
single source, often [fragile]{.mark}, [is the only remaining
producer]{.mark} of the material.]{.underline}**

These risks are among those clearly identified by the report, which
offers solutions to help them, ranging from additional funding to keep
domestic manufacturers in business to sourcing restrictions, such as the
proven Berry and Specialty Metals amendments, that protect manufacturers
from hostile foreign acts.

**[In addressing [the prevalence of hostile foreign trade
practices]{.mark} and other strategies designed to produce foreign
dependence and [weaken the]{.mark} American industrial [base]{.mark},
the report goes further]{.underline}** than the Department of Defense
has traditionally wanted to venture. **[The report clearly identifies
five macro factors that have weakened the defense industrial
base]{.underline}**, including the "Industrial Policies of Competitor
Nations." Though **[U.S. [manufacturing has declined]{.mark} for a
variety of reasons]{.underline}**, the report notes that
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in particular, **[[has used illegal
means]{.mark} to dominate critical global markets. These means include
espionage, evasion of export controls, market access restrictions,
subsidies, and dumping, among others.]{.underline}**

Only the hardiest of free-market economists would say that the U.S.
should ignore this flouting of the rules of global trade, and no serious
national security analyst should ignore how China has used these
techniques to acquire and exert dominance in sectors of critical concern
to the U.S. military, such as rare earths and energetic materials.

Fortunately, the report goes beyond problem identification to provide a
Blueprint for Action. Though many of these are locked away in a
classified annex to the report, the White House has provided some clues
as to how it wishes to proceed.

**[First]{.underline}**, and probably most importantly, **[is the
creation of [a national industrial policy]{.mark} to support national
security efforts. This [is an area where the Department of Defense has
been deficient for decades.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Though the Pentagon
retained an office of industrial policy, defense observers will tell you
that **[[its resources and power were]{.mark} quite [limited]{.mark}. It
had no power over the major [program offices]{.mark}, who [tended to
pursue low-cost]{.mark} globally available [options]{.mark}, sometimes
from unreliable foreign suppliers, even [at the expense of overall
industrial base health]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A cohesive industrial
policy that has buy-in from all the major offices in the Department of
Defense will go a long way in restoring needed capabilities within the
defense supply chain, with the potential to actually lower costs in the
long run by using the overall purchasing power of the U.S. military to
create economies of scale.

Secondly, **[the report encourages the use of direct funding to target
and support critical sectors of the supply chain.]{.underline}** Though
**[[the programs available]{.underline}]{.mark}** to carry out this
important mission --- the Defense Production Act Title III,
Manufacturing Technology, and Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment
--- already exist, they **[[need additional
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** to make significant changes in the
industrial base. Congress, to its credit, has provided the Title III
program with **[\$20 to \$30 million]{.underline}** in additional funds
annually, but this **[has been insignificant compared to the efforts
made by China and other nations to strip industrial capacity away from
the United States.]{.underline}** If the recommendations in the report
are to be executed, **[more Title III funds will be
required.]{.underline}**

The report also calls for **[additional efforts in education and with
allied nations to address workforce shortages and joint industrial
challenges]{.underline}**. Finally, though not specifically addressed in
the formal Blueprint, [[the report acknowledges]{.mark} that **[the
Pentagon's]{.mark} own acquisition [processes continue to pose
challenges]{.mark} for innovative manufacturers, [with red tape and
uncertain funding driving many potential suppliers
away.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

WASHINGTON --- **[A combination of [Chinese influence and budgetary
uncertainty means America's defense industrial base is decaying]{.mark}
at the lower levels, [with]{.mark} some [vital suppliers facing
"domestic extinction,"]{.mark} a new study]{.underline}** from the Trump
administration **[is warning]{.underline}** --- and direct investment
from the administration appears to be the solution.

The study, the result of an executive order issued by president Donald
Trump last July, also warns that if the situation is not remedied, the
Pentagon faces "limited capabilities, insecurity of supply, lack of R&D,
program delays, and an inability to surge in times of crisis."

The language seems dire, but much of **[the]{.underline}** 140-page
**[report appears to contain little new for those who have paid
attention to defense industrial issues [over the last several
years]{.mark}. Many of the concerns outlined in the report echo that of
a Defense Department internal study, released earlier this year, which
warned [long-term trends, including demographics and sole-source
suppliers going out of business]{.mark}, were set to [create major
hurdles]{.mark} for the department.]{.underline}**

The report has been long coming. Trump ordered its creation in July of
2017, with Peter Navarro, his trade czar and a well-known China hawk, as
the coordinating point man. At the time, Navarro said the study was
being driven by concerns that "we cannot retain a preeminent military
without a healthy, growing economy and a resilient industrial base."

By May 2018, the Pentagon had sent its conclusions into the White House
for coordination which set industry expectations of a release shortly
thereafter. However, the release dated continued to be pushed back, due
largely to other news overtaking the White House.

Trump, along with Deputy Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan, is expected
to appear at the White House Friday around 1:45 PM eastern time to sign
several actions into law. The full report will be released shortly
after.

**[[The report identifies]{.mark} five macro [issues]{.mark} facing the
defense industrial base:]{.underline}**

**[[Sequestration]{.mark} and uncertainty in U.S government spending,
which [create instability]{.mark} and drives small firms away from

**[[A decline of]{.mark} U.S. [manufacturing]{.mark} capability and

Arms Trade Treaty Could Reduce US Exports",
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/04/trump-withdrawal-arms-trade-treaty-could-harm-us-industry/156621/?oref=d-river

**[[The Arms Trade Treaty has helped keep U.S. companies
competitive]{.mark} in the global market [by requiring other countries
to adopt standards similar to America\'s.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In a fiery speech at the annual meeting of the National Rifle
Association on Friday, President **[Trump announced that the United
States would "unsign" the]{.underline}** Arms Trade Treaty, or **[ATT.
This decision is a mistake]{.underline}**, not only because it
undermines the United States' important role in multilateral diplomacy
on issues crucial to national and international security, but **[because
it harms U.S. defense industry interests]{.underline}** as well.

Adopted by the United Nations in 2013 and in force since the following
year, **[the ATT]{.underline}** is historic: it **[is the first legally
binding international agreement to regulate the global trade in
conventional arms by establishing common international standards for
member countries to incorporate into their national transfer control
systems.]{.underline}** The ATT now has 101 states parties and an
additional 34 signatories, including the United States, which signed but
did not formally ratify the treaty.

Put simply, **[the ATT is intended to stop the irresponsible transfer of
conventional arms, which are often used to commit violations of human
rights and international humanitarian law. The treaty also aims to
promote cooperation in the global arms trade by establishing clear
elements of national control systems, encouraging efficiency and
predictability in transfer decision processes, and facilitating
transparency to build confidence among trading partners.]{.underline}**

**[[The ATT's objectives are in the United States' interest]{.mark} --
strategically, politically, and [commercially]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
walking away from this agreement, **[the Trump administration is
needlessly putting U.S. interests at risk, particularly]{.underline}**
(and ironically) **[for the U.S. defense industry]{.underline}**.

In 2010, **[while the treaty was being drafted, [we convened the U.S.
Industry Working Group on the ATT to ensure that the proposed agreement
would not inadvertently harm U.S. defense
industry]{.mark}.]{.underline}** U.S. laws and regulations already
comprehensively control American weapons exports and imports in order to
protect U.S. national security interests and keep weapons out of the
hands of terrorists, human rights abusers, and other nefarious actors.

**[The U.S. defense industry's involvement helped ensure that the ATT
reflected the realities of the global arms trade and did not undermine
legitimate and legal business.]{.underline}** To the contrary: **[when
implemented effectively, [the ATT helps level the playing field]{.mark}
by requiring other countries to adopt standards similar to those that
U.S. companies must follow. While Russia and China have not joined the
treaty, [the ATT provides a]{.mark} principled [basis for the United
States and its allies to challenge]{.mark} these [countries' arms
exports]{.mark}]{.underline}**, where appropriate, **[as inconsistent
with international norms.]{.underline}**

The ATT is also intended to harmonize arms transfer laws and regulations
around the world. **[Rather than making industry follow a patchwork of
rules, [the ATT lays out]{.mark} clear elements of [a national control
system and criteria]{.mark} for states to consider when making arms
transfer decisions. Clarity and consistency in national systems
contribute to efficiency and predictability in the global arms market.
[This was a key objective for U.S. industry]{.mark} in the ATT
negotiations.]{.underline}**

The international arms trade is becoming increasingly globalized.
**[U.S. defense companies rely on a diverse set of actors across the
supply chain. Virtually all of our closest allies and partners are ATT
members, including all of Europe.]{.underline}**

**[Now [the United States will have to live with the consequences of
these key defense partners being inside the treaty while it remains in
the company of Syria]{.mark}, North Korea, and Iran.]{.underline}**

In short, **[the [decision to unsign the ATT puts U.S. industry at
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The President repeatedly referenced
"America First" and U.S. sovereignty in his announcement, but **[his
decision undermines the ability of the United States to secure its own
interests]{.underline}**. If the United States is not in the room when
the treaty is discussed, there is no way to influence the treaty
process, to share good practices, or to encourage governments to follow
the U.S. example. **[As the world's largest arms exporter, the United
States would be well served to ensure that treaty interpretation and
implementation is consistent with U.S. policy and practice. [Trump's
decision]{.mark} undermines U.S. leverage and [leaves America and its
industry isolated from U.S. allies.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The majority of the world's major conventional defense companies already
operate in one of the most regulated markets in the world. However,
**[this global industry does not operate in a global market. [Every
country has its own rules, providing for]{.mark} system shopping on the
one hand and [confusion]{.mark} on the other.]{.underline}** When
defense industries consider their markets, **[there is no one
standard]{.underline}**, no one list. Rather, **[there is a global
patchwork of systems ranging from very comprehensive to barely
functioning.]{.underline}**

**[The production and procurement of the means of
defense]{.underline}**, based on the national right of self-defense
constituted in Article 51 of the UN charter, is a necessary and
legitimate business, but one which **[poses very specific challenges.
[Modern trade routes]{.mark} often [traverse regions with]{.mark} little
or [no export enforcement]{.mark}, lacking even the most basic
regulatory requirements. This lack of control creates a risk that
weapons]{.underline}** might fall between the cracks and **[end up in
the wrong hands causing devastating effects on civilians, perpetuating
conflicts, and undermining development.]{.underline}** In addition,
these **[[loopholes are meticulously exploited]{.mark} by illegitimate
arms traders, [generating a hazardous environment for the]{.mark}
legitimate and responsible members of the [defense
industry]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[A well-]{.underline}**drafted and **[implemented]{.underline}**
International Arms Trade Treaty **[([ATT) would provide an urgently
needed solution]{.mark} to these challenges. The treaty could
effectively level the playing field in international arms transfers,
ensuring that legitimate transfers are held to consistent
standards]{.underline}**, and that there is a clear distinction between
the legitimate and illegitimate arms trade. With an ATT, **[[trading
partners will be able to communicate in a common regulatory
language]{.mark}, thereby [facilitating operations]{.mark}, decreasing
risk, [and improving trading route security.]{.mark} That is why the ATT
makes perfect commercial sense and is thus starting to generate support
from major defense companies.]{.underline}**

#### Ratification solves [Defense Partners]{.underline}\-\--"unsigning" isolates us from [allies]{.underline}\-\--[ratification]{.underline} increases the likelihood of US businesses getting [more international arms deals]{.underline} since other countries would feel [more secure]{.underline}. That's [Stohl]{.underline}. [Generic defense doesn't apply]{.underline} because US industry was [involved in the ATT negotiations]{.underline} and carved out this [specific]{.underline} treaty to [maximize their profits]{.underline}

#### [Company reputation]{.underline} AND [internal]{.underline} compliance system [cost]{.underline}

Strong International Transfer Controls as a Trade Advantage

**[Globalization affects the defense industry trade]{.underline}** like
any other business. Today's **[major [defense systems combine]{.mark} a
plethora of [different actors and countries to]{.mark} design, finance,
[build]{.mark} and deploy [an end product]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Twenty
years ago, defense industries operated within a national framework with
technological development, prototypes and final production carried out
within a single country's border. That is not the case today. **[By
[opening the process of development]{.mark} and production, one also
[opens the system to risk of diversion]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[A corporation's reputation is]{.mark} one of its most
[valuable]{.mark} assets.]{.underline}** Thus **[any potential
[diversion]{.mark} of the company's product to nefarious actors
[represents a major concern. Being regarded as a]{.mark} responsible and
[trustworthy trade partner is]{.mark} key for a successful business
transaction and [crucial for any company's long term survival.]{.mark}
Regulatory non-compliance can severely damage the brand and standing of
the company as a whole. [Having solid controls]{.mark} on strategic
goods [is widely accepted to confer a significant trade
advantage.]{.mark} Companies go to great lengths to establish internal
programs for compliance encompassing all of the different national
strategic trade control systems. [Starting with the same international
terms of reference would]{.mark} make rules and regulations more
identifiable and therefore substantially [cut the costs for the
establishment of]{.mark} such [an internal compliance system]{.mark}.
Companies could potentially build compliance with one standard as a
foundation, rather than dozens.]{.underline}**

#### [Technological Advantages]{.underline}

Access to Technological Gains

**[[Arms]{.mark} and defense technologies [are]{.mark}]{.underline}**
often **[some of the more [technologically sophisticated]{.mark}
equipment traded internationally. Cutting edge technology can give the
combatant the winning hand in a conflict, but the same [technology
can]{.mark} also [have]{.mark} a wide range of [civilian
applications]{.mark}. The military industry has in modern history
yielded some of the most important civilian advantages in]{.underline}**
areas [[such as **flight, navigation and cyberspace**]{.mark}**. Today
the trend is often reversed with civilian inventions used for military
purposes, but still [the need for secure transactions remains. Finding
the right balance]{.mark} between the need for protection of military
equipment and national security as well as safeguarding legitimate
civilian use [is the dual-use dilemma that states]{.mark}, international
organizations and companies [have struggled with]{.mark} for decades.
Gaining [access to these technological advantages is key to any
company]{.mark} worldwide, [but]{.mark} it [must come with]{.mark} a
sense of responsibility and proven [commitment to legitimate business
conduct]{.mark}. Adherence and support to the international efforts to
better safeguard the trade as such is therefore a logical and timely
conclusion.**]{.underline}

**[A]{.underline}** strong and **[universally adopted [ATT could]{.mark}
provide an international standard for a regulated trade in conventional
arms and could [prevent the devastating effects]{.mark} that
[uncontrolled arms transfers have on civilian populations]{.mark} and
regional stability.]{.underline}** On October 30th, 2009, 153 United
Nations members, cast a historic vote in favor of establishing an Arms
Trade Treaty. In July 2010 the negotiations on the terms of the treaty
are scheduled to start with an aim to have a treaty ready for the
concluding UN Conference in 2012. **[The defense industry has good
reason to follow and support this process, chief among them being the
potential to obtain more reliable trade routes through universal
acceptance of strategic trade controls and to avoid inadvertent
non-compliance to relevant rules because of the lack of a common and
well-understood language. By supporting an]{.underline}** international,
legally binding **[Arms Trade Treaty, modern-day defense equipment
companies can contribute both to a safer world and a more secure global
arms trade.]{.underline}**

### Link Defense\-\--ATT won't hurt DIB\-\--2AC

#### Arms sales to repressive regimes [not key]{.underline} to defense industrial base

William **Hartung 6/24**, director of the Arms and Security Project at
the Center for International Policy, June 24^th^, 2019, "Do U.S. Defense
Firms Really Need To Export Arms To Saudi Arabia?",
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2019/06/24/do-u-s-defense-firms-really-need-arms-exports/#2a39bb763eb7>

Building on **[the Saudi mega-deal]{.underline}** -- which independent
analysts have determined **[may be as little as 10% as large as the
\$110 billion figure the president claims]{.underline}** -- **[Trump has
thrown out incredible estimates of the U.S jobs generated]{.underline}**
by the Saudi sales, from 40,000 to 500,000 and **[up to one
million]{.underline}** if one counts related deals outside the military
sphere. An estimate I did for a report by **[the Center for
International Policy indicates that [the real number of jobs
generated]{.mark} by the roughly \$2.5 billion a year [in arms
deliveries]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia [over the past decade is]{.mark}
likely [20,000]{.mark} to 40,000 jobs, [a tiny fraction of the more than
150 million jobs in the U.S. economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Is this just another case of Trumpian exaggeration]{.underline}**,
aimed at portraying him as a master deal maker who can bring good jobs
to America in general and the heartland in particular, or is there more
to it? There's no question that **[particular companies benefit from
Saudi sales]{.underline}**. The bulk of the more than \$150 billion in
U.S. arms offers to Riyadh since 2009 have involved four of America's
top five defense contractors -- **[Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon,
and General Dynamics]{.underline}** -- in deals that have involved
everything from combat aircraft to tanks to missile defense systems to
armored vehicles to combat ships. The most controversial deals have
involved precision-guided munitions that have been used by Saudi Arabia
in its brutal war in Yemen, which has sparked one of the world's worst
humanitarian catastrophes. And **[all of these firms are seeking to grow
their export markets]{.underline}**, both to increase profits and to
provide insurance against the ups and downs of the Pentagon procurement
budget.

**[But the truth of the matter is that [U.S. firms could do without
sales to]{.mark} Saudi Arabia and other [repressive regimes, and they'd
still be doing just fine financially]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[The
current Pentagon budget]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[is at one of the
highest levels since World War II, and it [provides ample funding
for]{.mark} procurement and [R&D]{.mark}, much of [which lands
in]{.mark} the coffers of major defense firms that are the leading
[weapons exporters]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is particularly true
when one considers that the most likely outcome would not be a total ban
on sales to Saudi Arabia, but a prohibition on weapons most relevant to
the Yemen war -- precision-guided munitions in particular. Other deals,
like a lucrative \$15 billion sale of the Lockheed Martin THAAD missile
defense system to Riyadh, would likely remain untouched. Arms sales in
general are important to key firms like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon,
which got roughly one-quarter to one-third of their revenues,
respectively, from foreign sales in 2018. But **[[the biggest export
earners were]{.mark} missile defense systems and combat aircraft
[exported to allies in Europe and Asia, not]{.mark} bombs being used in
[war zones]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

When arms companies are asked whether they have moral qualms about how
their weapons are being used in Yemen and other war zones, the stock
response is generally "we're just following U.S. government policy." But
this bland assertion ignores the fact that **[U.S. defense firms spend
millions every year trying to shape U.S. government
policy.]{.underline}** They are far from passive recipients of edicts
from Washington. **[It would be refreshing if at least one firm adopted
a policy of not selling weapons that are likely to be used in gross
human rights abuses]{.underline}** (Raytheon, are you listening?). But
that may be too much to ask. Given President Trump's embrace of the
Saudi regime and other authoritarian governments, that leaves it up to
Congress to set the rules of the road, as it has been trying to do
recently, as when the Senate voted to block the president's "emergency"
sales of bombs and other equipment to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. **[The
arms industry has been missing in action when it comes to the moral
dimensions of this debate]{.underline}**. History will judge whether
this was a wise decision on their part.

**[[Innovation in the defense industry is mostly supported by direct

[contracts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, **[[the DOD]{.mark} customer
[directs]{.mark} the trajectory of [innovation and pays for]{.mark}
specific [R&D]{.mark} effort. [Another fraction]{.mark} of total defense
R&D [comes from]{.mark} companies' [Independent Research and
Development]{.mark} (IR&D) expenditures, [reimbursed by the
government]{.mark} as part of the overhead cost of other
government-funded defense projects. IR&D spending is company directed,
but it is also paid for by the DOD customer, not drawn from the
company's retained earnings]{.underline}**. As a result, **[general
increases in defense firms' profitability---which might stem from [arms

suppliers in the defense supply chain operate on commercial
terms]{.underline}**, and for them, **[the general added revenues from
expanded defense sales contribute to the retained earnings that support
their R&D investment.]{.underline}**19 Thus, **[[at the supplier level,
arms sales can contribute]{.mark} to US innovation.]{.underline}**
However, generally, **[[the suppliers are less visible, as are the
innovations they]{.mark} might choose to [invest in]{.mark} with the
marginal dollar of income. Due to that lack of visibility, it would be
difficult for an economic assessment]{.underline}**, as part of the CAT
approval process, **[to give much weight to the potential

#### Industry stats are overblown

Emily **Stewart 18**, October 21^st^, 2018, Reporter for Vox, ""It's not
going to create or take away a single job": why Trump's excuse on the
Saudis doesn't hold up",
<https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/21/18003696/trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-weapons-jobs>

**[Overall, the private US defense industry does directly
employ]{.underline}** a lot of US workers --- **[about
355,500]{.underline}** in 2016, **[according to the [most the recent
estimates](https://www.aia-aerospace.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017_AnnualReport_FF_Final_Web.pdf)]{.underline}** from
the Aerospace Industries Association. But **[private-sector [defense
workers make up less than 0.5 percent of the total US labor
force]{.mark}, and [that includes every person whose job depends]{.mark}
directly [on the sale or production]{.mark} of airplanes, tanks, bombs,
and services [for the entire US military]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It's
unlikely that many of them, if any, depend directly on weapons sales to
Saudi Arabia, and its also unlikely that those jobs would vanish if
Saudi money disappeared.

"**[It's not going to create or take away a single job]{.underline}**, I
don't think," Jim Corridore, director of industrials research at the
research and investment firm CFRA Research, told me. "**[[There are
other homes for]{.mark} these [products should]{.mark} these [deals fall
through]{.mark}.]{.underline}**"

Companies have been distancing themselves from Saudi Arabia in the wake
of Khashoggi's disappearance, but as [the New York
Times](about:blank) notes, **[plenty of money is still
flowing]{.underline}**.

Corridore said **[[even if]{.mark} the US or [defense companies slow
down contract agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}** for a bit, **[it will
likely only be until the dust settles around the current controversy.
"The most likely scenario is a short-term delay in these deals where we
say we're not going to do them, time goes by, [reforms are made]{.mark},
and the deals are made]{.underline}**," he said.

The Saudis could potentially go to Russia and China to try to make other
weapons deals, and that could potentially be problematic later down the
line for future sales because equipment from those countries can't
communicate with equipment made by companies in the US --- sort of how
Macs and PCs used to work. But the experts I spoke with said that
**[risk is limited and still not much leverage for the
Saudis.]{.underline}**

Even so, again, **[the jobs estimates Trump is putting out are
"tremendously overblown,"]{.underline}** said Andrew Miller, the deputy
director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy who served
on the National Security Council under Obama. And **[it's not just Trump
who is likely overstating the importance of the deals to jobs --- it's
likely the companies too]{.underline}**.

"**[It's clear that [\[defense companies\] exaggerate the number of
jobs]{.mark} any weapons sale is going to generate]{.underline}**,"
Miller said. "In many instances, **[the number of jobs is only a quarter
to a third of what they've pledged at the outset.]{.underline}**"

**[One of the central ambitions at [Bretton Woods]{.mark} was to [create
an international economic system]{.mark} that would help governments
avoid the self-undermining processes that characterized earlier
periods]{.underline}**, especially that of the classic gold standard and
the inter-war period. During the classic gold standard (1880--1914),
governments were obligated to undertake internal austerity programs to
restore balance in their external accounts. This created enormous
political strains within countries with large balance of payments
problems and undermined the credibility of their commitment to the gold
standard regime. The regime became unsustainable and collapsed

**[In the 1930s, in attempts to restore accounts, governments engaged in
competitive devaluations that exacerbated instability in international
markets. To prevent such scenarios from occurring again, governments at
Bretton Woods agreed to a fixed but adjustable exchange rate regime, to
limit capital mobility, and to give governments significant discretion
in cushioning the adjustment costs from economic openness. To facilitate
these objectives, focal organizations were endowed with the authority to
collect information, oversee common objectives, and facilitate
negotiated adjustments. An important legacy of such international
authority construction was that focal organizations came to house
unrivalled organizational and intellectual capacity in global economic
matters.]{.underline}**

**[As [economies have become more interdependent]{.mark}, the capacity
of legacy bureaucracies has grown with the demand for authoritative
information and effective solutions to new challenges. Even if at times
controversial, the large bureaucracies of the Fund and Bank are global
authorities that have remained central to how the most intricate aspects
of international monetary policy and persistent development challenges
are managed]{.underline}** (e.g.

**[A not dissimilar process occurred [after 2008]{.mark}. The Global
Financial Crisis that unexpectedly engulfed the world economy quickly
reignited debates about reforms to the Bretton Woods system. At summits
in Washington, London, and Pittsburgh, the leaders of the world's 20
largest economies and major international organizations sought to
establish the foundations of what US President Barack Obama described as
a 'new era of economic management']{.underline}**

While **[the international [financial institutions have exhibited great
durability]{.mark}]{.underline}**, their pathways of reform have been
neither linear, nor speedy, nor predictable. The IMF is an instructive
example. A decade before the global financial crisis, the IMF had been
pilloried from all political sides following the Asian Financial Crisis.
The Fund experienced reductions in clients and staff, and encountered
significant challenges to its authority and legitimacy. But despite
these challenges, the IMF emerged after 2008 with an expanded mandate
and enhanced authority. A recognition by governments that the Fund had
significant capacity to help governments in need and its participation
in the financial rescues of Eurozone countries, for example, allowed it
to recover a focal position in international monetary and financial
affairs

#### [Econ resilient]{.underline}\-\--institutions, cooperation, and [experts are biased]{.underline}

Oliver **Stuenkel 15**, Assistant Professor of International Relations
at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) in São Paulo, reviewing a book by
Daniel Drezner, American professor of international politics at The
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, February
21^st^, 2015, "Book review: "The System Worked" by Daniel W. Drezner",
<https://www.postwesternworld.com/2015/02/21/review-system-drezner/>

**[Despite an initial shock worse than that of the Great Depression,
[the]{.mark} global [economy managed to bounce back after]{.mark} the
[2008]{.mark} crisis. This was in no small part [because global economic
governance functioned properly to]{.mark} maintain economic openness and
[build resiliency]{.mark} into the international system.]{.underline}**

Indeed, **[the most affected [countries]{.mark}\' Finance
Ministers]{.underline}**, the author points out**[, [responded with
fiscal stimulus, protectionism was averted, and global leaders
co-ordinated]{.mark} macroeconomic policy to restore growth. Drezner\'s
analysis of the world economy shows that things not only got back to
normal far quicker than during the Great Depression that began in 1929.
Many [positive trends]{.mark}, such as poverty reduction, [continued
throughout the crisis]{.mark}. All that was partly [due to]{.mark}
existing [international institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Drezner
contends. **[[The WTO]{.mark}, for example, helped [put a brake
on]{.mark} increases in [tariffs]{.mark} and non-tariff
barriers.]{.underline}**

In order to support his claims, Drezner builds a multi-pronged argument.
First of all, according to the author, **[most [experts\'
perception]{.mark} of events [during the crisis was biased]{.mark}
towards excessive criticism. Even [policy makers could]{.mark} safely
put the [blame]{.mark} on international [institutions: difficult to
understand for the public and unable to defend themselves]{.mark}, they
are an easy target.]{.underline}**

Also, **[given the slow and convoluted way global governance works, it
was easy to find fault.]{.underline}** Indeed, Drezner contends that
**[it would have been impossible to objectively assess, in the midst of
the crisis, whether the multitude of meetings and summits was having an
impact or not. Only]{.underline}** now, seven **[years later, is it
possible to say whether international economic institutions helped keep
the global economy from complete disaster.]{.underline}** He also
reminds the reader that **[global governance is no panacea: \"The best
global governance structures in the world cannot compensate for
dysfunctional national governments.\"]{.underline}** Finally, he
contends that **[most observers merely point to global governance\'s
most obvious failures - the Doha Round, the climate change summits and
the deadlock at the G20 - without bothering to study the underlying
trends, many of which are far more promising]{.underline}**. Thus, for
Drezner, **[global economic governance - [the WTO,]{.mark} the
[IMF,]{.mark} the [World Bank and]{.mark} the [G20 -]{.mark} clearly
[passed the stress test.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Contrary to what most observers think, Drezner also argues that
**[[institutions have proven to be good at adapting]{.mark} to a more
multipolar economic order]{.underline}**:

While **[the appointments of Lagarde and Kim (to head the IMF and World
Bank]{.underline}**, respectively) might appear to be politically
retrograde, they [rep**resent bargaining that reflected the greater
influence of the advanced developing countries.**]{.underline} I both
cases, **[the nominee had to woo developing countries to secure
political support in advance of voting.]{.underline}**

That argument may have some truth to it: **[[The appointment of]{.mark}
Chinese national Min [Zhu to]{.mark} be deputy managing director of [the
IMF was enough to co-opt China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet, the
decisions hardly increased the institutions\' legitimacy in the eyes of
policy makers in Brasília and Delhi, who continue to argue that the
status quo is unacceptable.

**[Despite the overwhelming perception that the State Department system
was effective at protecting human rights]{.underline}**, it is worth
noting that the US record on arms sales has been anything but solid in
recent years. IELR Editor-in-Chief, Bruce **[Zagaris
wrote]{.underline}** in 2016 that **[a lack of effective export controls
within the US has led to [a]{.mark} significant [flow of "high-powered
weaponry from the U.S]{.mark}. to Latin America]{.underline}** and the
Caribbean **[which]{.underline}** has
**[[exacerbated]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[soaring rates of
[gun]{.mark}-related [violence]{.mark} in the region [and undermine\[d\]
U.S. influence]{.mark} in the Western Hemisphere".]{.underline}**
Between 2015 and 2017, the United States approved \$2 million to \$4
million in gun sales per year to Honduras, an amount which is
significant in a relatively poor country like Honduras.
**[Some]{.underline}** of the **[[guns sold to Honduras were turned on
protestors]{.mark} in 2017 [and]{.mark} many [others ended]{.mark} up
[in]{.mark} the hands of [criminals, with]{.mark}]{.underline}** photo
**[[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}** revealing that many of the **[[guns
used by state forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the 2017 protests [**[had
been]{.underline}** **[exported from]{.underline}**]{.mark} Colt's
Manufacturing in **[[Connecticut]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[Because the escalation of violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** and abuse
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** these **[[Latin American]{.mark} countries
has fueled the current migrant crisis]{.underline}**, **[it is
likely]{.underline}** that **[[US efforts to]{.mark}
[deregulate]{.mark}]{.underline}** its **[[international arms

[escalat]{.mark}]{.underline}**ion **[of [the migration crisis in

US arms]{.mark} trade [will]{.mark} be a source of
[increas]{.mark}]{.underline}**ing **[[instability

So, **[why does]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[continue
to]{.underline}** operate in ways which are likely to **[undermine
its]{.underline}** long-term **[national security
objectives]{.underline}**? **[The answer is]{.underline}** alluded to in
the previous reference to Trump's NRA speech: **[domestic
politics]{.underline}**. **[It is not an accident that the President
chose]{.underline}** **[this venue to sign his executive
order]{.underline}** withdrawing the US from the ATT. In international
organizations, domestic politics remains the strongest indicators of a
states' compliance with agreements. **[The NRA and other opponents of
the ATT have historically wielded significant political power in
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
The NRA, one of the strongest lobbying groups in the US, spent over \$36
million on the Trump campaign in 2016, breaking its previous records for
campaign spending. **[There were]{.underline}** also allegations that
the group illegally coordinated with the Trump campaign to maximize the
value of expenditures on ads and to avoid repetitive efforts. President
Trump has responded to this support by heavily supporting the NRA, even
going so far as to attack the New York attorney general's office this
week for "illegally" investigating the NRA.

**[The Administration's]{.underline}** wholehearted **[acceptance of the

http://www.csbaonline.org/publications/2014/01/hemispheric-defense-in-the-21st-century/)

As the previous chapter demonstrates, for the past two hundred years
**[[the principal cause of concern for]{.mark} U.S.
defense]{.underline}** policymakers and **[planners thinking about
[Latin America has been the prospect that great powers]{.mark} outside
the Western Hemisphere [could exploit]{.mark} the military weakness and
[internal security challenges]{.mark} of the states within it to
threaten U.S. security.]{.underline}** While there is reason for
optimism about the future of Latin America,58 there is also cause for
concern. The region faces enduring obstacles to economic59 and political
development60 as well as signi􀂿cant internal security challenges. As
General John Kelly, the commander of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)61
noted in his March 2013 posture statement before Congress, Latin
America: 􀀾I􀁀s a region of enormous promise and exciting opportunities,
but it is also one of persistent challenges and complex threats. It is a
region of relative peace, low likelihood of interstate con􀃀icts, and
overall economic growth, yet is also home to corrosive criminal
violence, permissive environments for illicit activities, and episodic
political and social protests.62 [**The
[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} and non-traditional security
challenges that General Kelly cites **[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark}**
potential **[[opportunities]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the United States'
major [rivals to]{.mark}]{.underline}** (borrowing a term from Monroe's
declaration) "**[[interpose" themselves into the region]{.mark} and, by
so doing, threaten regional stability and U.S. security]{.underline}**.
Two discernible trends suggest that current and prospective **[Eurasian
rivals could seek to exploit regional conditions]{.underline}** and
dynamics **[in ways that could impose immense costs on the United States
and divert its attention from more distant theaters overseas. The first
trend is a return to a heightened level of competition among the "great
powers"]{.underline}** following two decades of U.S. dominance. The
second trend concerns the growing cost of projecting power by
traditional military means due to the proliferation of
"anti-access/area-denial" (A2/AD) capabilities in general, and
precision-guided munitions (PGMs) in particular. These trends suggest
that, despite a possible decline in relative U.S. power, external forces
will continue to 􀂿nd it beyond their means to threaten the hemisphere
through traditional forms of power projection. Far more likely is a
return of a competition similar to that which the United States engaged
in with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. During that period both
powers sought to avoid direct con􀃀ict with the other, given the risks of
escalation to nuclear con􀃀ict. Instead each focused primarily on gaining
an advantage over the other through the employment of client states and
non-state groups as proxies. Proxies were employed for reasons other
than avoiding a direct clash, such as gaining positional advantage
(e.g., enabling the sponsor to establish bases in its country, as the
Soviets did in Cuba). Proxies were also employed as a means of diverting
a rival's attention from what was considered the key region of the
competition and to impose disproportionate costs on a rival (e.g.,
Moscow's support of 􀀱orth Vietnam as a means of drawing o􀌆 U.S.
resources from Europe). This chapter outlines trends in the Western
Hemisphere security environment that outside powers may seek to exploit
to advance their objectives in ways that threaten regional stability and
U.S. security. This is followed by a discussion of how these external
powers might proceed to do so. Seeds of Instability Crime, Illicit
Networks, and Under-Governed Areas Latin America has a long history of
banditry, smuggling, and organized crime. As in the case of Pancho Villa
and the 1916-1917 Punitive Expedition, these activities have
occasionally risen to a level at which they in􀃀uence U.S. national
security calculations. Rarely, however, have these activities been as
pervasive and destabilizing as they are today. Although a wide variety
of illicit activity occurs in Latin America, criminal organizations
conducting drug tra􀌇cking are the dominant forces in the Latin American
underworld today, accounting for roughly 􀀇􀀗0 billion per year63 of an
estimated 􀀇100 billion in annual illicit trade.6􀀗 Since the Colombian
cartels were dismantled in the 1990s, this lucrative trade has been
dominated by powerful Mexican cartels whose operations extend across the
length and breadth of Mexico, as well as up the supply chain into the
cocaine-producing regions of the Andean Ridge and through their
wholesale and retail drug distribution networks across the United
States.65 The cartels, along with countless smaller criminal
organizations, comprise what the head of SOUTHCOM has described as, 􀀾a􀁀n
interconnected system of arteries that traverse the entire Western
Hemisphere, stretching across the Atlantic and Paci􀂿c, through the
Caribbean, and up and down 􀀱orth, South, and Central America . . . 􀀾a􀁀
vast system of illicit pathways 􀀾that is used􀁀 to move tons of drugs,
thousands of people, and countless weapons into and out of the United
States, Europe, and Africa with an e􀌇ciency, payload, and gross pro􀂿t
any global transportation company would envy.66 That being said, the
drug tra􀌇cking underworld is by no means a monolithic entity or
cooperative alliance. Rather, it is a fractious and brutally competitive
business in which rival entities are constantly and literally 􀂿ghting to
maximize their share of the drug trade and for control of the critical
transshipment points, or plazas, through which it 􀃀ows. To attack their
competitor's operations and protect their own operations from rivals and
the Mexican government's crackdown that began in 2006, the cartels have
built up larger, better armed, and more ruthless forces of hired gunmen
known as sicarios. Using the billions of dollars generated by their
illicit activities, they have acquired weapons and equipment formerly
reserved for state armies or state-sponsored insurgent groups, including
body armor, assault ri􀃀es, machine guns, grenades, landmines, anti-tank
rockets, mortars, car bombs, armored vehicles, helicopters, transport
planes, and---perhaps most remarkably---long-range submersibles.67 The
cartels' pro􀂿ts have also enabled them to hire former police and
military personnel, including members of several countries' elite
special operations units68 and, in several cases, active and former
members of the U.S. military.69 These personnel bring with them---and
can provide to the cartels---a level of training and tactical pro􀂿ciency
that can be equal or superior to those of the government forces they
face. As a result of this pro􀂿ciency and the military-grade weapons
possessed by the cartels, more than 2,500 Mexican police o􀌇cers and 200
military personnel were killed in confrontations with organized crime
forces between 2008 and 2012 along with tens of thousands of
civilians.70 In the poorer states of Central America, state security
forces operate at an even greater disadvantage.71 While their
paramilitary forces enable the cartels to dominate entire cities and
large remote areas through force and intimidation, they are not the only
tool available. The cartels also leverage their immense wealth to buy
the silence or support of police and government o􀌇cials who are often
presented with a choice between plata o plomo---"silver or lead."
According to the head of the Mexican Federal Police, around 2010 the
cartels were spending an estimated 􀀇100 million each month on bribes to
police.72 By buying o􀌆 o􀌇cials---and torturing or killing those who
cannot be corrupted---the cartels have greatly undermined the
e􀌆ectiveness of national government forces in general and local police
in particular. This, in turn, has undermined the con􀂿dence of the
population in their government's willingness and ability to protect
them. Through these means and methods the cartels have gained a
substantial degree of de facto control over many urban and rural areas
across Mexico, including major cities and large swathes of territory
along the U.S.-Mexico border. In many of these crime-ridden areas the
loss of con􀂿dence in the government and police has prompted the
formation of vigilante militias, presenting an additional challenge to
government control.73 Meanwhile, in the "northern triangle" of Central
America (the area comprising Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador
through which the cartels transship almost all cocaine bound for Mexico
and the United States) the situation is even more dire. Approximately 90
percent of crimes in this area go unpunished, while in Guatemala roughly
half the country's territory is e􀌆ectively under drug tra􀌇ckers'
control.7􀀗 Further south, similar pockets of lawlessness exist in
coca-growing areas in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.
In Colombia and along its borders with Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru,
much of the coca-growing territory remains under the control of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. A guerrilla
organization founded in the 1960s as a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary
movement dedicated to the overthrow of the Colombian government, the
FARC embraced coca growing in the 1990s as a means of funding its
operations and has subsequently evolved into a hybrid mix of left-wing
insurgent group and pro􀂿t-driven cartel.76 This hybrid nature has
facilitated cooperation between the FARC and ideological sympathizers
like the Bolivarian Alliance, Hezbollah, Al Qaeda in the Islamic
Maghreb, and other extremist groups77 as well as with purely criminal
organizations like the Mexican cartels. Although the FARC has been
greatly weakened over the past decade and no longer poses the
existential threat to the Colombian government that it once did, it
remains 􀂿rmly in control of large tracts of coca-producing jungle,
mostly straddling the borders between Colombia and FARC supporters
Venezuela and Ecuador. In summary, organized crime elements have
exploited under-governed areas to establish zones under their de facto
control. In so doing they pose a signi􀂿cant and growing threat to
regional security in general and U.S. interests in particular. As
SOUTHCOM commander General Kelly recently observed: 􀀾T􀁀he proximity of
the U.S. homeland to criminally governed spaces is a vulnerability with
direct implications for U.S. national security. I am also troubled by
the signi􀂿cant criminal capabilities that are available 􀀾within them􀁀 to
anyone---for a price. Transnational criminal organizations have access
to key facilitators who specialize in document forgery, trade-based
money laundering, weapons procurement, and human smuggling, including
the smuggling of special interest aliens. This criminal expertise and
the ability to move people, products, and funds are skills that can be
exploited by a variety of malign actors, including terrorists.78
Hezbollah and the Bolivarian Alliance Hezbollah in Latin America
􀀱on-state entities recognized by the U.S. as terrorist organizations
also operate in the region, most notably Lebanon-based Hezbollah, an
Iranian client group. Hezbollah maintains an active presence in the
tri-border area (TBA) of South America--- the nexus of Argentina,
Brazil, and Paraguay---stretching back to the 1980s. The TBA has
traditionally been under-governed and is known by some as "the United
􀀱ations of crime."79 Eight syndicate groups facilitate this activity in
South America's so-called "Southern Cone," overseeing legitimate
businesses along with a wide range of illegal activities to include
money laundering, drug and arms traf- 􀂿cking, identity theft and false
identi􀂿cation documents, counterfeiting currency and intellectual
property, and smuggling. 􀀱ot surprisingly they are linked to organized
crime and to non-state insurgent and terrorist groups, such as the
FARC.80 Estimates are that over 􀀇12 billion in illicit transactions are
conducted per year, a sum exceeding Paraguay's entire GDP by a
substantial amount.81 Hezbollah achieved notoriety in the region in 1992
when it bombed the Israeli embassy in Argentina. This was followed with
the bombing of the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires two
years later. Like many other terrorist organizations, as Hezbollah
expanded it established relationships with drug cartels82 that it
supports in a variety of ways. For example, the cartels have enlisted
Hezbollah, known for its tunnel construction along the Israeli border,
for help in improving their tunnels along the U.S.-Mexican border. In
2008, Hezbollah helped broker a deal in which one of Mexico's major drug
cartels, Sinaloa, sent members to Iran for weapons and explosives
training via Venezuela using Venezuelan travel documents. 83 As the
locus of the drug trade and other illegal cartel activities moved north
into Central America and Mexico, Hezbollah has sought to move with it
with mixed success. In October 2011, Hezbollah was linked to the e􀌆orts
of an Iranian-American to conspire with Iranian agents to assassinate
the Saudi ambassador to the United States. The plot involved members of
the Los Zetas Mexican drug cartel.8􀀗 The would-be assassin, Mansour
Arbabsiar, had established contact with his cousin, a Quds Force85
handler, Gen. Gholam Shakuri. The plot is believed by some to be part of
a wider campaign by the Quds Force and Hezbollah to embark on a campaign
of violence extending beyond the Middle East to other Western targets,
including those in the United States.86 In early September 2012, Mexican
authorities arrested three men suspected of operating a Hezbollah cell
in the Yucatan area and Central America, including a dual U.S.-Lebanese
citizen linked to a U.S.-based Hezbollah money laundering operation. 87A
few months later, in December 2012, Wassim el Abd Fadel, a suspected
Hezbollah member with Paraguayan citizenship, was arrested in Paraguay.
Fadel was charged with human and drug tra􀌇cking and money laundering.
Fadel reportedly deposited the proceeds of his criminal
activities---ranging from 􀀇50-200,000 per transaction---into Turkish and
Syrian bank accounts linked to Hezbollah. In summary, Hezbollah has
become a 􀂿xture in Central and Latin America, expanding both its
activities and in􀃀uence over time. It has developed links with the
increasingly powerful organized crime groups in the region, particularly
the narco cartels, along with radical insurgent groups such as the FARC
and states like Venezuela who are hostile to the United States and its
regional partners. Hezbollah's principal objectives appear to be
undermining U.S. in􀃀uence in the region, imposing costs on the United
States, and generating revenue to sustain its operations in Latin
America and elsewhere in the world. These objectives are shared by Iran,
Hezbollah's main state sponsor. The Bolivarian Alliance As noted above,
geographic, economic, and cultural factors have traditionally helped to
prevent the emergence in Latin America of any real military rival to the
United States. Although there are no traditional military threats in the
region, there are indigenous states whose actions, policies, and
rhetoric challenge regional stability and U.S. security. Over the past
decade, several states have come together to form the Bolivarian
Alliance of the Americas (ALBA), an organization of left-leaning Latin
American regimes whose overarching purpose is to promote radical
populism and socialism, foster regional integration, and reduce what
they perceive as Washington's "imperialist" influence in the region.89
Since its founding by Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro of Cuba
in December 200􀀗, the Bolivarian Alliance has expanded to include
Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Dominica, Ecuador, 􀀱icaragua, and Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines. Although the members of the Bolivarian
Alliance are militarily weak and pose almost no traditional military
threat to the United States or its allies in the region,90 they
challenge American interests in the region in other ways. First, they
espouse an anti-American narrative that finds substantial support in the
region and consistently oppose U.S. efforts to foster cooperation and
regional economic integration.91 Second, in their efforts to undermine
the government of Colombia, which they consider to be a U.S. puppet,
ALBA states provide support and sanctuaries within their borders to coca
growers, drug traffickers, other criminal organizations, and the FARC.92
Links to Hezbollah have also been detected.93 Perhaps of greatest
concern, they have aligned themselves closely with Iran, inviting it and
Syria to participate as "observer states" in the alliance. Other
worrisome ALBA activities involve lifting visa requirements for Iranian
citizens and hosting large numbers of Iranian diplomats and commercial
exchange members that some observers believe to be Iranian intelligence
and paramilitary Quds Force operatives.9􀀗 By hosting and cooperating
with both foreign agents and violent non-state actors, the ALBA states
have come to function as critical nodes in a network of groups hostile
to the United States. A Coming Era of Proxy Wars in the Western
Hemisphere? History shows that Washington has often emphasized an
indirect approach to meeting challenges to its security in Latin
America. Yet the United States has not shied away from more direct,
traditional uses of force when interests and circumstances dictated, as
demonstrated over the past half century by U.S. invasions of the
Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada (1983), and Panama (1989) and the
occupation of Haiti (199􀀗).Yet several trends seem likely to raise the
cost of such operations, perhaps to prohibitive levels. Foremost among
these trends is the diffusion of precision-guided weaponry to state and
non-state entities. 92 The Second Lebanon War as "Precursor" War A
precursor of this trend can be seen in the Second Lebanon War between
Israel and Hezbollah.95 During the con􀃀ict, which lasted less than 􀂿ve
weeks, irregular Hezbollah forces held their own against the highly
regarded Israeli Defense Force (IDF), demonstrating what is now possible
for non-state entities to accomplish given the proliferation of
militarily-relevant advanced technologies. Hezbollah's militia engaged
IDF armor columns with salvos of advanced, man-portable, antitank guided
missiles and other e􀌆ective anti-armor weapons (e.g. rocket-propelled
grenades (RPGs) with anti-armor warheads) in great numbers. When the IDF
employed its ground forces in southern Lebanon, its armored forces
su􀌆ered severe losses; out of the four hundred tanks involved in the
􀂿ghting in southern Lebanon, forty-eight were hit and forty damaged.96
Hezbollah's defensive line was also well equipped with latest-generation
thermal and low-/ no-light enhanced illumination imaging systems, while
frontline units were connected to each other and higher command elements
via a proprietary, 􀂿ber-optic based communications network, making
collection of communications tra􀌇c by Israeli intelligence extremely
di􀌇cult. Perhaps most important, Hezbollah possessed thousands of short-
and medium- range rockets, often skillfully hidden below ground or in
bunkers that made detection from overhead surveillance platforms nearly
impossible. During the brief con􀃀ict Hezbollah's forces 􀂿red some four
thousand unguided rockets of various types that hit Israel. Hezbollah's
rocket inventory enabled its forces to attack targets throughout the
northern half of Israel. Over nine hundred rockets hit near or on
buildings, civilian infrastructure, and industrial plants. Some two
thousand homes were destroyed, and over 􀂿fty Israelis died with several
thousand more injured. The casualties would undoubtedly been greater if
between 100,000 and 250,000 Israeli civilians had not 􀃀ed their homes.
Haifa, Israel's major seaport had to be shut down, as did its oil
re􀂿nery.97 Hezbollah also employed several unmanned aerial vehicles for
surveillance of Israel, as well as C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles used
to attack and damage an Israeli corvette. 98 The G-RAMM Battlefield The
brief war between Israel and Hezbollah suggests that future irregular
forces may be well-equipped with enhanced communications, extended-range
surveillance capabilities, and precision-guided rockets, artillery,
mortars and missiles (G-RAMM) 99 able to hit targets with high accuracy
at ranges measured from the tens of kilometers perhaps up to a hundred
kilometers or more. In projecting power against enemies equipped in this
manner and employing these kinds of tactics U.S. forces---as well as
other conventional forces--- will find themselves operating in a far
more lethal battlefield than those in either of the Gulf wars or in
stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Moreover, currently
constituted conventional forces typically depend on large fixed
infrastructure (e.g., military bases, logistics depots, ports,
airfields, railheads, bridges) to deploy themselves and sustain combat
operations. These transportation and support hubs also serve as the
nodes through which internal commerce and foreign trade moves within a
country. This key, fixed infrastructure will almost certainly prove far
more difficult to defend against irregular forces armed with G-RAMM
weaponry. Indeed, had Hezbollah's "RAMM" inventory had only a small
fraction of G-RAMM munitions, say 10-20 percent, it would have been able
to in􀃀ict far greater damage than it did historically to Israeli
population centers, key government facilities, military installations,
and essential commercial assets such as ports, air􀂿elds, and industrial
complexes. An irregular enemy force armed with G-RAMM capabilities in
substantial numbers could seriously threaten Latin American governments
as well as any U.S. (or external great power) forces and support
elements attempting a traditional intervention operation. Implications
for the U.S. and Other Major Powers The preceding narrative suggests
that the combat potential of irregular forces is likely to increase
dramatically in the coming years. As this occurs, the cost of operating
conventional forces---especially ground forces---and defending key
military support infrastructure is likely to rise substantially. Given
these considerations the United States and other major powers external
to the Western Hemisphere will have strong incentives to avoid the use
of conventional forms of military power, particularly large ground
forces, in favor of employing irregular proxy forces to advance their
interests. Moreover, the high cost and questionable bene􀂿t of the
campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq are likely to create strong domestic
opposition in the United States to such operations for some time to
come. This must be added to the United States' greatly diminished 􀂿scal
standing that has led to large cuts in planned investments in defense.
These factors suggest that Washington will be much less likely to engage
in direct military action in Latin America in the coming years than
historically has been the case. At the same time, rivals of the United
States like China and Russia may be incentivized by these trends, as
well as the United States' overwhelming military dominance in the
Western Hemisphere, to avoid the direct use of force to expand their
in􀃀uence in Latin America. Instead, like some of the Bolivarian Alliance
members, they appear likely to follow the path taken by the Soviet Union
during the Cold War and Iran today: supporting non-state proxies to
impose disproportionate costs on the United States and to distract
Washington's resources and attention from other parts of the world.
**[This is not to say that Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran would eschew
future opportunities to establish bases in Latin America]{.underline}**.
As in the past, such bases can support efforts to accomplish several
important objectives. They can, for example, further insulate a Latin
American regime from the threat of direct U.S. military intervention,
since **[Washington would have to account for the possibility that [the
conflict would lead to a direct confrontation with a]{.mark} more
capable and potentially [nuclear-armed power.]{.mark}]{.underline}**100
**[[Bases]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the hemisphere
**[[can]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[enable]{.mark} external powers

as training[,]{.mark} more easily. **[[Electronic
surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the United States and Latin
American states **[[could be accomplished more cheaply and
effectively]{.mark} from forward positions. Finally, certain kinds of
military capabilities, such as long-range ballistic [missiles]{.mark}
and attack submarines, [could be]{.mark}]{.underline}** pro􀂿tably
**[[stationed]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Latin America by powers external
to that region, particularly if they intended to create the option of
initiating con􀃀ict at some future date. These reasons, among others,
have made preventing an extra-hemispheric power from establishing bases
in Latin America an enduring U.S. priority. Players in a Latin American
Great Game **[[Given current trends]{.mark}, several [powers external to
the region may]{.mark}, either now or over the coming decade, [have both
the motive and the means to employ both state and non-state
proxies]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Latin American to achieve their
interests. Principal among them is Iran, which is already engaged in
supporting proxies against the United States and its partners in the
Middle East and has long been developing proxies in Latin America.
Additionally, **[there are reasons to think that China and Russia may be

#### Trump will increase troops to the Southern border in response to migrants\-\--this weakens our ongoing great power competition. [\*\*\*PLACEHOLDER]{.mark}

**[Burns 18]{.underline}** (Robert Burns, AP national security reporter;
Lolita C. Bolder, National Security/Pentagon Reporter Associated Press,
11-1-2018, "Border mission doesn\'t fit Jim Mattis\' focus on
\'lethality\'", Chicago Sun-Times,
https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/11/1/18394192/border-mission-doesn-t-fit-jim-mattis-focus-on-lethality,
accessed 7-13-2019) wl

WASHINGTON --- Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has left no doubt that his
top priority as leader of the military is making it more "lethal" ---
better at war and more prepared for it --- and yet nothing about the
military's new mission at the U.S.-Mexico border advances that goal.
Some argue it detracts from it.

**[The troops going to the border areas]{.underline}** of Texas, Arizona
and California **[are a small fraction of the military's roughly 1.3
million active-duty members]{.underline}**, and the mission is set to
last only 45 days. **[But [many question the wisdom of drawing]{.mark}
even several [thousand away from training]{.mark} for their key purpose:
to win wars.]{.underline}**

James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral and former head of U.S. Southern
Command, said the **[[troops should be preparing for
combat]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other missions, "**[[not monitoring a
peaceful border]{.underline}]{.mark}**" for the arrival of a migrant
caravan of several thousand people on foot, still about 900 miles away.

"**[It sends a terrible signal to Latin America and the Caribbean as we
unnecessarily militarize our border,"]{.underline}** Stavridis, who also
served as the top NATO commander, said Thursday. "**[It places U.S.
troops who are fundamentally untrained for the mission of border
security]{.underline}** and border enforcement **[into an area of
operations]{.underline}**, which could cause incidents of a negative
character. If we need more border patrol agents, hire them."

The first 100 or so active duty troops arrived at the border on
Thursday, making initial assessment at the McAllen, Texas, crossing.
Overall, there are about 2,600 troops at staging bases in the region.

David Lapan, a retired Marine colonel who is a former spokesman for the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Department of Homeland Security,
said that taking troops away from training and from their families to
play a supporting role in border security is unwise.

"**[It just doesn't make any sense]{.underline}**," said Lapan, now a
vice president of communications at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
"**[This caravan]{.underline}**, this group of poor people, **[including
a lot of women and children]{.underline}**, **[doesn't pose a threat ---
not a national security threat."]{.underline}**

**[In line with [the Pentagon's national security
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[Mattis has been focused on
improving]{.underline}** the **[combat readiness of a military worn down
by the recent years of]{.underline}** **[congressionally imposed budget
cuts]{.underline}** and the grind of 17 years of war in Afghanistan.
**[This [includes reorienting training from]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
required for **[the [smaller wars]{.mark} the U.S. has
fought]{.underline}** since the 9/11 terrorist attacks **[[to a "great
power" struggle with Russia and China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[That
context may explain why th[e Pentagon]{.mark}]{.underline}** itself
**[[seemed]{.mark} caught [off-guard by]{.mark}]{.underline}** President
Donald **[[Trump's]{.mark} abrupt [order to dispatch active-duty
troops]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the Customs and Border Patrol, which
requested Pentagon help, has struggled to define details of the mission
and explain its scope.

"That this is a security threat is preposterous and not supported by the
evidence," said Derek Chollet, former senior policy adviser at the
Pentagon. "**[[If you're]{.underline}]{.mark}** sitting **[in the
Pentagon]{.underline}** **[and worried about]{.underline}**
implementation of the **[national defense strategy]{.underline}** **[and
worried about the threats from China and Russia, this is not at the top
of your list."]{.underline}**

"This is another version of the parade," Chollet said, referring to
Trump's demand earlier this year --- eventually withdrawn --- that the
military spend millions to stage a parade in Washington D.C. "**[[This
is not a good use of U.S. military resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** at
this moment. [**[Trump was frustrated in his effort to build a physical
wall on the border,]{.underline}** **[now he's trying to build a human
wall by using the U.S. military."]{.underline}**]{.mark}

Mattis has rejected assertions that the military is being leveraged by
the White House as a political stunt in advance of the midterm
elections. "We don't do stunts," he said Wednesday, but neither has he
argued that sending thousands of active-duty soldiers to help secure the
border is his preference.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, who as head of U.S. Northern Command is
commanding the military operation, dubbed "Operation Faithful Patriot,"
has argued that the caravan is a potential threat, although he has not
fully defined that.

"I think what we have seen is we've seen clearly an organization at a
higher level than we've seen before," O'Shaughnessy said. "We've seen
violence coming out of the caravan and we've seen as they've passed
other international borders, we've seen them behave in a nature that has
not been what we've seen in the past."

One concern raised by other defense officials is that the caravans are
largely male-dominated, and that one of them used violence when crossing
the border into Mexico. But Associated Press journalists traveling with
the largest group say it includes many families, including hundreds of
children, and it has been orderly and peaceful, with no sign of any
danger.

**[The military says it is deploying 7,000]{.underline}** troops to
Texas, Arizona and California, and **[while it has left open the
possibility that the number could grow by another thousand under current
plans, the scope of the mission has grown in recent days.]{.underline}**
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he would send as many as
15,000 troops.

Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said in a letter to Trump on Thursday that his administration
has given the committee no evidence that migrant caravans pose a direct
security threat to the U.S.

"**[This is not a military problem; [it does not warrant a military
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Reed wrote. He said **[the
administration should disclose the cost of the military's border
mission]{.underline}** "**[and [what impacts it will have on military
readiness]{.mark} and the overall budget."]{.underline}**

With his eyes squarely on Tuesday's election contests, Trump has rushed
a series of immigration declarations, promises and actions as he tries
to mobilize supporters to retain Republican control of Congress. His own
campaign in 2016 concentrated on border fears, and that's his focus in
the final days of the midterm fight.

Trump has railed against illegal immigration, focusing on the migrant
caravans that have been going on for several years but received little
attention until now. The largest at the moment consists of about 4,000,
down from a high of about 7,000, and is still in southern Mexico.
Several smaller groups, estimated at a combined 1,200 people, are
farther away.

## Extra-T Example

### Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty

#### You could've re-ratify the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.

Daryll **[Kimbal No Date]{.underline}**, Executive Director; Kingston
Reif, Director for Disarmament and Threat Reduction Policy, \"The
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty at a Glance,\"
https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/abmtreaty

On December 13, 2001, President George W. Bush, who argued that
Washington and Moscow no longer needed to base their relationship on
their ability to destroy each other, announced that the United States
would withdraw from the ABM Treaty, claiming that it prevented U.S.
development of defenses against possible terrorist or \"rogue-state\"
ballistic missile attacks. During his presidential campaign, Bush said
he would offer amendments on the treaty to Russia and would withdraw the
United States from the accord if Russia rejected the proposed changes.
However, the Bush administration never proposed amendments to the treaty
in its talks with Russia on the subject. Although of \"unlimited
duration,\" the treaty permits a state-party to withdraw from the accord
if \"extraordinary events...have jeopardized its supreme interests.\"
**[[The U.S. withdrawal took effect]{.mark} June 13, 2002 [and the
treaty is no longer in force.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

What **[[the ABM Treaty Prohibited]{.underline}]{.mark}**

- Missile defenses that can protect all U.S. or Soviet/Russian territory
  against strategic ballistic missiles

- Establishing a base for a nationwide defense against strategic
  ballistic missiles

- Development, testing, or deployment of sea-, air-, space-, or mobile
  land-based ABM systems or components. (Because of the inability of
  either country to verify activities behind closed doors, the
  development and testing ban was understood to apply when components
  and systems moved from laboratory to field testing.)

- Development, testing, or deployment of strategic missile interceptor
  launchers that can fire more than one interceptor at a time or are
  capable of rapid reload

- Upgrading existing non-ABM missiles, launchers, or radars to have ABM
  capabilities and testing existing missiles, launchers, or radars in an
  ABM mode (i.e. against strategic or long-range ballistic missile
  targets)

- Deployment of radars capable of early warning of strategic ballistic
  missile attack anywhere other than on the periphery of U.S. or
  Soviet/Russian territory and oriented outward

- Deployment of ABM radars capable of tracking and discriminating
  incoming strategic targets and guiding defensive interceptors, except
  within a 150 kilometer radius of the one permitted defense

- **[[Transfer]{.mark} or deployment [of ABM systems]{.mark} or
  components [outside U.S. and Soviet/Russian
  territory]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The SM-3 Block IIA is an anti-ballistic missile that can be employed
on Aegis-class destroyers or on land]{.underline}**, via the Aegis
Ashore program, according to a State Department official.

\"If concluded, this proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy
and national security interests of the United States by enhancing
Japan\'s Maritime Self Defense Force\'s \... ability to defend Japan and
the Western Pacific from ballistic missile threats,\" the official said.

**[The]{.underline}** **[sale would]{.underline}** also \"**[follow

official added.

Throughout 2017, North Korea has conducted a series of ballistic missile
tests despite constant criticism from the West and trade sanctions.

The most provocative moment came November 29, when North Korea said it
successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile,
topped with a \"super-large heavy warhead\" which it said was capable of
striking the US mainland.

Last month, **[Japan\'s cabinet approved a plan to buy two US-built
Aegis missile defense systems]{.underline}**, state broadcaster NHK
reported, as the country faces increasing hostility from neighboring
North Korea.

Russia slams US plan to sell anti-missile system to Japan

**[Russia accused the US of violating an arms control treaty by agreeing
to supply anti-missile systems to Japan.]{.underline}**

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the deal with
Japan was part of a bigger plan by the US for a \"global anti-missile
system.\"

Zakharova claimed they were in breach of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty, an arms control agreement between Moscow and Washington
that has been in force for 30 years.

\"We need to bear in mind that all **[these systems have universal
missile launchers that can use all types of missiles.]{.underline}** It
means another violation of the INF treaty and we see that Japan is an
accomplice in this matter,\" she said.

The US rejected the accusation. \"**[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is in full
compliance with the INF Treaty]{.underline}**. Russian claims to the
contrary are false and meant to deflect attention from Russia\'s own
very clear violations,\" a spokesman for the US State Department told
CNN at the time.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis spoke with Japan Minister of Defense
Itsunori Onodera on Monday to discuss a range of US-Japan alliance
matters and reaffirmed US commitments to the defense of Japan \--
pledging to work closely with his Japanese counterpart to bolster
critical alliance capabilities.

In the 2016 U.S. presidential debates, as on other occasions, the theme
of Latin America and the Caribbean was remarkably absent. **[Important

**[the impending collapse of Venezuela;]{.underline}** and the Colombian
public's rejection, on October 2, 2016, of the agreement between the
government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Yet
even with its geographic connectedness to the United States, **[and

any other part of the world, **[Latin America]{.underline}**, and the
Caribbean **[continue to be]{.underline}** remarkably **[absent from the
U.S. strategic and foreign policy discourse.1]{.underline}**

Part of the job of the U.S. Army War College is to educate future
military leaders and prepare them for higher command, including thinking
about the global strategic environment within which U.S. forces operate
and how that environment is evolving. **[[A range of security-related
issues compete for the attention of U.S. leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria

**[cyberthreats]{.underline}**]{.mark}, potentially disruptive new
technologies, **[[and]{.mark} even the emergence of [space]{.mark} as a
theater in which multiple U.S. rivals now operate.]{.underline}**

To be frank, the space that Latin America occupies in the agenda of
senior U.S. military leaders is limited at best. Within the U.S. Army,
there are talented people who serve in Latin America-focused assignments
in the Pentagon, U.S. Army South, U.S. Southern Command, U.S. Special
Operations Command 7th Group, National Guard State Partner Programs
(SPPs), and within the individual security cooperation offices (SCOs) of
the U.S. embassies in Latin America, among others. However, **[the
number of Latin America-focused U.S. Army personnel]{.underline}** **[is
small compared to the number of personnel focused on other
areas]{.underline}**, such as the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe,
and, of course, the U.S. homeland.

The Strategic Importance of the Region.

Let\'s be clear. Although it is possible to postulate scenarios in which
terrorists, rogue governments, or foreign powers pose a threat to the
United States from Latin America and the Caribbean, by comparison to the
rest of the world, the region is at peace and arguably does not present
the same near-term existential threats to the United States as those
found in other regions.

Yet, therein lies the misunderstanding. The absence of a near-term
existential threat from **[Latin America and the
Caribbean]{.underline}** does not make it any less strategically
important for the United States. Its **[strategic importance
stems]{.underline}** from **[its]{.underline}** **[unique and inherent
potential]{.underline}** **[as both a vulnerability and]{.underline}**
as **[an opportunity to support the effectiveness of U.S. engagement in
the globally interconnected world.]{.underline}**

As noted previously, [**[there is]{.underline}** **[arguably no
region]{.underline}**]{.mark} (including Asia) **[[upon which
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[is more dependent for its
prosperity and security]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and with which it is
more closely tied through bonds of family, **[than Latin
America]{.underline}** and the Caribbean. **[[In terms of
trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** and investment, from manufacturers to the
food Americans put on the table, **[[there is no region for which
disruption of commerce with the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[could do more damage to our economy]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the
everyday lives of Americans. Reciprocally, **[the region's proximity to
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[makes it a logical]{.underline}** and attractive **[business
partner]{.underline}**; **[there is not another region]{.underline}** of
the world for **[which]{.underline}** prosperity, healthy
infrastructure, and institutions **[could]{.underline}** **[contribute
more to a win-win commercial relationship with the United
States.]{.underline}**

[**[With respect to security]{.underline}**,
**[the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[is blessed]{.underline}** **[by
the absence of neighbors that pose a]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[direct
[military threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the nation, are experiencing
conditions of chaos, or permit U.S. adversaries to operate from their
territory. Yet, **[[if these fortunate conditions were to
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[the resulting threat to U.S. national
security could force a significant reorientation of U.S. security
initiatives away from its foreign engagements to address the emergent
threat closer to home.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

To use a military analogy, Latin America and the Caribbean is, for the
United States, an "unoccupied high ground." The fact that the United
States does not fully leverage the opportunities offered by Latin
America, nor suffers a significant immediate security threat from the
region, does not make it any less strategic.

The Challenge of Transnational Organized Crime in the Region.

**[The activities of transnational organized crime in Latin
America]{.underline}** and the Caribbean, often **[characterized as the

**[is]{.underline}** more of **[a strategic challenge]{.underline}**
**[to the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates than is commonly understood.

On the one hand, **[[the activities of groups such as the Maras]{.mark}
in the Northern Triangle [and warring cartels]{.mark} in
Mexico]{.underline}** [**[generate violence]{.underline}** **[and

Indeed, the 2014 crisis of child migrants from Central America obliged
the Obama administration to request an additional \$3.7 billion to
respond to the situation, eclipsing the \$979 million previously spent
on the region under the Central America Regional Security Initiative
since 2008.2

In addition, **[[the money used to enable transnational criminal
activities]{.mark} corrupts institutions, undermining governance, and
expanding criminal networks]{.underline}** **[that [can be used by
terrorist organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to raise and launder
money, smuggle persons and materiel through the]{.underline}** region,
**[as well as [creating spaces in which they can]{.mark} hide, train,
plan operations, and [recruit fighters for their global
activities.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Such threats are magnified]{.underline}]{.mark}** further **[[where
anti-U.S. governments]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as the "Bolivarian
Socialist" government of Venezuela, **[tolerate and]{.underline}**
possibly even **[[facilitate]{.mark} the [activities]{.mark} of such
groups]{.underline}**, permitting, for example, the entry of Iranian
paramilitary Qods forces into the region through the country.3

The Need for U.S. Scenario Planning to Include the Potential Use of the
Region by U.S. Adversaries to Conduct Actions Against the United States.

**[[Military]{.mark} [professionals]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[in
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[have the responsibility for
planning how to fight the nation's wars]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[if

today's globally interconnected world[, it is highly
unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[a U.S. "near-peer competitor,"
such as [China or Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} **[[would
allow the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[to engage]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with **[them]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** such a
**[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** (however undesirable) entirely
**[[as an "away game]{.mark}."]{.underline}** **[U.S.]{.underline}**
**[defense]{.underline}** **[planners must expect]{.underline}** that
**[in]{.underline}** such **[a conflict]{.underline}**, **[the adversary
would employ its full global range of assets]{.underline}**,
**[capabilities]{.underline}**, **[and options]{.underline}**,
**[including]{.underline}**: **[relationships]{.underline}** and access
agreements **[with foreign militaries]{.underline}** (however benign)
**[in all parts of the world]{.underline}**, knowledge of, and the
potential **[for, staging activities]{.underline}** leveraging their
commercial operations near the United States, as well as information
technology infrastructure built by the adversary's companies there.

**[Potential U.S. adversaries such as [Russia and
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[may]{.underline}**]{.mark} be expected
to **[[leverage]{.underline}]{.mark}** such assets and **[[relationships
in Latin America]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the Caribbean, in addition
to other regions, in order **[to [undermine U.S. coalition formation in
the run-up to a conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[to conduct
operations in the region]{.underline}** during the conflict **[to
disrupt the U.S. economy]{.underline}** and financial system,
**[and]{.underline}** potentially to **[conduct military
operations]{.underline}** **[from Latin America]{.underline}** and the
Caribbean **[to attack U.S. deployment]{.underline}** and sustainment
flows, **[and to put the U.S. homeland at risk]{.underline}**, thus
**[forcing the diversion of U.S. forces from other
theaters.]{.underline}**

**[While [Russia and China have]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[not]{.underline}** currently **[established]{.underline}** formal
**[military bases]{.underline}** in the region **[that [could]{.mark} be
used against the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, **[their familiarity with Latin
American]{.underline}** **[armed forces]{.underline}** through regular
military-to-military engagement, their knowledge of regional
infrastructure such as ports, airports, and commercial logistics
systems, **[means that they could achieve a functional military
capability in the region]{.underline}** rapidly in the months leading up
to the conflict, **[if U.S. adversaries]{.underline}** in Latin America
**[permitted them to do so.]{.underline}**

Although it is unthinkable for many in the United States that a Latin
American or Caribbean country would collaborate militarily with an
extra-regional power against the United States, the rejection of this
proposition presumes that the U.S. victory in such a conflict would be
so certain as to deter hostile regimes in the region from betting
against us. Yet, **[despite U.S. hubris]{.underline}**, **[such
presumptions]{.underline}** are increasingly **[cast]{.underline}** in
**[doubt]{.underline}** with **[the]{.underline}** evolution of
**[global power balances]{.underline}**. To recall a historical example,
the German government believed, in the run-up to World War II, that
Mexico might contemplate allying with them against the United States to
help recuperate Mexican territory lost to the United States in the
Spanish-American War.

Nor would such foreign support necessarily have to be overt. During
World War II, German U-boats, re-supplied with the assistance of German
sympathizers in the region, sank over 180 merchant marine ships in the
Caribbean.4

Latin America as a Strategic Opportunity.

While it is important to understand **[Latin America's]{.underline}**
potential as a strategic vulnerability for the United States, it
**[should]{.underline}** also **[be recognized]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** **[the numerous opportunities]{.underline}** that
**[it presents]{.underline}** to the United States **[as a
partner]{.underline}**, **[to]{.underline}** more effectively **[engage
globally]{.underline}** in support **[of shared values]{.underline}**
**[such as democracy and human rights.]{.underline}**

**[Latin American]{.underline}** **[military]{.underline}** and other
government forces **[have substantial]{.underline}**, but
little-leveraged **[knowledge]{.underline}**, experience, and capability
**[to contribute to coalition efforts.]{.underline}**
**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has]{.underline}** already **[discovered the potential
for]{.underline}** such **[collaboration]{.underline}** **[within the
region through programs such as the Colombia Action Plan.
Outside]{.underline}** the region, a core component of U.S. security
assistance and capability building efforts in complex, corrupted, and
conflict-ridden societies involves questions in which their Latin
American counterparts have ample experience. One example is the military
support to local police forces. **[Such operations involve a complex
range]{.underline}** of considerations **[involving the
relationship]{.underline}** **[between the local military and the
police]{.underline}**, and the relationship of both to the local
community. U.S. personnel working such activities in Iraq and
Afghanistan have had to learn "on the fly." Yet, such military-police
coordination is a challenge that their Salvadoran, Honduran, or
Guatemalan counterparts must deal with on a daily basis.

Leveraging the Opportunity of Latin America and Preventing it from
Becoming a Strategic Threat.

The instruments for **[leveraging]{.underline}** the strategic potential
of **[Latin America]{.underline}** and the Caribbean **[and preventing
it from becoming a strategic threat to the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[are mostly
non-military]{.underline}**. **[They]{.underline}**
**[have]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** do with the
**[strengthen]{.underline}**ing of **[institutions, democracy, the rule
of law, and equitable societies]{.underline}** and political systems in
which populist leaders cannot exploit the legitimate aspirations for a
better life of the marginalized in order to further those leaders' own
wealth and power. **[Preventing Latin America from becoming a strategic
threat]{.underline}** **[involves maintaining]{.underline}** a region of
governments with **[transparency and checks and balances that can
maintain healthy economic and political relationships]{.underline}**
with a variety of global partners, **[without becoming co-opted by
anti-U.S. actors]{.underline}** to sustain their own political survival.

**[The price]{.underline}** of leveraging the region and preventing it
from becoming a strategic threat to the United States **[is remarkably
low]{.underline}**, yet more than what U.S. policymakers have been
willing to pay to date, absent compelling immediate threats.

Although U.S. behavior toward Latin America and the Caribbean in the
past has created a complex legacy to navigate, **[overcoming
resentments]{.underline}** and suspicion **[of the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates that **[exists in some
parts of the region can be achieved with]{.underline}** sustained and
**[sincere commitment]{.underline}** on the basis of a respectful and
equitable partnership. There will always be naysayers.

The number of Latin American business and military professionals who
have attended U.S. institutions, and who have family in the United
States is without equal among U.S. rivals, yet that is arguably
underleveraged as an asset for building goodwill and partnerships.

From the point of view of military engagement, U.S. proximity and shared
history with the region means that the United States has a legacy of
working relationships with Latin American militaries and other groups on
which to build. Indeed, the substantial proportion of Latinos in the
United States and the U.S. Armed Forces means that there is not another
region of the world in which the United States has similarly broad
options to engage with its partners through shared language and
ethnicity.

**[While extra-hemispheric actors like the Russians may]{.underline}**
have **[established substantial human ties]{.underline}** and some
residual goodwill during the Cold War, **[neither the
Russians]{.underline}** **[nor]{.underline}** others, such as **[the
Chinese]{.underline}** or the Iranians, **[have the ability to engage
the region through the shared bonds of language]{.underline}** **[and
culture]{.underline}** that **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is able to
leverage]{.underline}**.

The Need for More Strategic Thinking about Latin America and the
Caribbean.

While **[the importance of Latin America]{.underline}** to the United
States **[demands]{.underline}** more **[resources and attention from
the U.S. leadership]{.underline}**, **[it also requires]{.underline}**
more **[strategic thinking]{.underline}** **[about the dynamics of the
region]{.underline}**, **[the implications]{.underline}** of those
dynamics in both the region and other parts of the world, **[and
how]{.underline}** best **[to work with regional partners]{.underline}**
to manage the associated challenges.

Although only one resource within one part of the U.S. Government, the
U.S. Army War College benefits each year from the presence of some of
the most talented officers in the U.S. military who attend the
institution as students. That student body is further enriched by the
presence of international fellows, including some of the best and
brightest officers from Latin America and the Caribbean itself. This
essay encourages more of the talented officers receiving their
strategic-level education at the War College to consider focusing their
strategic research projects (SRPs) on the strategic challenges and
opportunities within the region, and to continue deepening such thinking
as they progress in their careers.

With respect to the content of U.S. strategic thinking about Latin
America and the Caribbean, this article makes five recommendations. In
each, the U.S. State Department should have the lead on the U.S. side,
with the support of the Department of Defense and other parts of the
U.S. and partner nation governments in the region.

**[First, the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[needs to analyze]{.underline}** **[the
challenges of Latin America]{.underline}** and the Caribbean **[in more
system-oriented terms]{.underline}** **[as it works with its partners in
the region]{.underline}** on how **[to address]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** complex **[problems of security]{.underline}**,
governance, and prosperity in an internationally coordinated,
whole-of-government fashion. Too often, the United States and its
regional partners apply government resources in a semi-coordinated, but
traditional fashion: without truly analyzing the interdependence of the
threat and the socioeconomic context in which it is rooted; without
identifying the centers of gravity of that system, such as finance and
corruption, in order to develop strategic concepts for how best to
attack those challenges.

**[Second]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should]{.underline}** **[make strong
institutions and the rule of law in Latin American societies the anchor
point for U.S. strategy]{.underline}** toward the region, **[since these
are key to combating transnational organized crime and achieving
equitable growth]{.underline}** **[that makes those
societies]{.underline}** more likely to **[prosper and more resistant to
exploitation by populists]{.underline}** who seek to leverage perceived
inequality and corruption to take control of the national political
system and pervert it for the benefit of the populist leaders' personal
wealth and power. In the process, **[governments with strong
institutions are]{.underline}** also **[more resistant to predatory
behavior]{.underline}** by extra-hemispheric actors who may offer easy
finance and special favors for individual leaders in the interest of
advancing their own strategic position. **[While the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[already promotes
strong institutions]{.underline}** and the rule of law in the region,
**[U.S. decision-makers should recognize the centrality of these
conditions in relation to the rest of the objectives that it pursues in
the region,]{.underline}** and invest more resources toward
strengthening the region's institutions and promoting the rule of law,
always in a respectful fashion and within the framework of the national
objectives of partners in the region.

**[Third]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[must do more to reduce narcotics
consumption]{.underline}** **[within its borders, and the export of
firearms]{.underline}** **[from the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to]{.underline}**
**[the region]{.underline}**, as well as communicating more effectively
with the region regarding its efforts to do so. Largely unknown in the
region, the United States does spend significant resources on reducing
drug demand domestically, and preventing guns acquired (legally or
otherwise) in the United States from leaving the country. Yet **[there
is a strong perception in the region]{.underline}** that **[the scourge
of transnational criminal actors is fueled by U.S.]{.underline}**
**[drug demand, and]{.underline}** the violence that they unleash is
enabled by **[U.S. firearms]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[must]{.underline}**
do more to **[combat]{.underline}** **[both this perception, and this
reality]{.underline}**, if it wishes to strengthen its relationship with
the region.

**[Fourth]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[must]{.underline}** **[be]{.underline}**
**[more responsive to exploiting strategic opportunities]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[addressing]{.underline}** **[risks arising
from]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** situation and **[political
orientation of individual countries]{.underline}** in the region. At
present, for example, Peru**[, Argentina, and Brazil have
set]{.underline}** **[aside experiments with socialist and
ethno-nationalist governments]{.underline}** **[in favor of
pro-democracy]{.underline}**, pro-market, rule of law-oriented
**[leaders]{.underline}**. **[It is in the strategic
interest]{.underline}** of the United States **[to invest]{.underline}**
the **[modest resources]{.underline}** and policy support required **[to
help those new leaders succeed.]{.underline}**

Reciprocally, as the "Bolivarian Socialist" regime in Venezuela teeters
on the brink of economic and political collapse, despite the enormous
petroleum resources available to its government over the past 17 years,
the United States must do more to highlight to the region the false
promise of adopting anti-market policies in the name of development, and
the undermining of democratic institutions in the name of the people.

**[Finally]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[should]{.underline}** **[pay]{.underline}** **[more
attention]{.underline}** **[to shaping the framework of multilateral
institutions]{.underline}** and rules **[within which
interactions]{.underline}** **[occur within the
hemisphere]{.underline}**, **[including engagement with]{.underline}**
extra-hemispheric actors such as **[Russia, Iran, and]{.underline}** the
People\'s Republic of **[China]{.underline}**. It is strategically
important for the United States, for example, to have a healthy
Organization of American States and a functional inter-American system
to ensure that the challenges of the region are resolved through a
democratic framework in which the United States, as an integral part of
the region, has a seat at the table. Similarly, with the continuing
expansion of trans-Pacific commerce and other relations, the United
States should regard the implementation of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, and the successful advance of the Pacific Alliance, as
strategic matters, helping to ensure that such engagements are conducted
within a framework of transparency and the rule of law, and in which all
nations sharing the Pacific Rim have equal prospects to reap the
benefits of their innovation and good policies.

**[Latin America]{.underline}** and the Caribbean **[are vital to the
security]{.underline}** and strategic position **[of the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as it
engages]{.underline}** in **[an]{.underline}** ever **[more
interdependent world]{.underline}**. Investing the resources and taking
actions commensurate with that thinking does not imply a U.S. retreat
from engagement further from home, but in the long-run, is necessary to
sustaining it, and doing it effectively. In that effort, the students of
the U.S. Army War College have a modest, but important, role to play, as
do those far beyond the War College with a stake in the security and
prosperity of the United States and the region of which it is
inextricably a part.

**[The Mexican military is the only legal importer of
firearms]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}**to **[Mexico]{.underline}**.
In turn, **[the Mexican army is the only legal distributor of guns
within the country]{.underline}**; **[personal possession]{.underline}**
of firearms **[is highly restricted]{.underline}**, with a single
military-run retail store for gun sales in Mexico City. Aside from the
weapons that the military acquires for its own forces, **[most legally
imported guns in Mexico are sold to state and local]{.underline}**
police **[forces]{.underline}**. **[More than half of the 305,086 guns
sold by the Mexican Secretariat]{.underline}** of National Defense --
which includes the army and air force and is known by its Spanish
acronym SEDENA --- from 2010 through 2016 were sold to police, according
to documents released by SEDENA in response to a public records request.

**[[Since criminal organizations arm]{.mark} themselves [with U.S.
assault weapons illegally]{.mark}]{.underline}** trafficked from the
U.S. retail market, **[[legal exports to]{.underline}]{.mark}** police
and **[[the military are part of a deadly arms
race]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[with these organizations]{.underline}**.
**[More than 20,000 firearms obtained by Mexican state]{.underline}**
and federal police **[went missing]{.underline}** or were
**[stolen]{.underline}** from 2006 to 2017, according to SEDENA data.
More than 7,000 of the weapons went missing from police in Mexico City
and Mexico state. In the state of Guerrero, **[the number of guns gone
missing or stolen]{.underline}** between 2010 and 2016 amounts to nearly
one-fifth of the firearms police acquired in the state during the same
period.

There is also evidence that **[firearms legally imported from
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[have been used in some of the worst human rights violations in
Mexico]{.underline}** in recent years. The local police who attacked the
43 Ayotzinapa students were armed with AR6530 rifles, a model variant of
the AR-15, legally supplied through licensed shipments from Colt,
according to documents in the judicial record.

An investigation by Mexico's National Human Rights Commission found that
Federal Police, who carried out the massacre of 22 persons in Tanhuato,
Michoacán, in 2015, killed five of them with Dillon Aero guns mounted on
Black Hawk helicopters. The Dillon guns fire some 125 rounds per second,
and Mexico obtained 16 of them for the army in 2013, for just over \$1
million, and then another 12 in 2015, according to Mexico's most recent
Arms Trade Treaty report.

in 2007, of which 4.5 million were properly registered with the army.

These are unusual cases, in that we know which weapons were involved.
Most homicides in Mexico --- including those carried out by state forces
--- are never investigated, so there is no judicial record identifying
the firearms that were used. But **[the volume of U.S. firearms going to
Mexico,]{.underline}** **[combined with the [well-established record
of]{.mark} police and [military forces colluding with organized crime
and committing gross human rights violations, means that U.S. guns
are]{.mark} certainly [at the scene of many]{.mark} more
[crimes.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The example of U.S. gun producer Sig Sauer is instructive as to how guns
move from the military to police. **[In]{.underline}** April
**[2015]{.underline}**, **[the U.S. State Department issued a \$266
million license to Sig Sauer]{.underline}**: \$265 million for gun
sales, and \$1 million for other equipment and technical support to the
Mexican navy, defense ministry, interior ministry, and federal and state
police forces. **[That year, Mexico imported 3,060
rifles]{.underline}**, 3,819 pistols, and 505 machines guns produced by
Sig Sauer's New Hampshire production facilities. The license also
permits the Mexican navy to assemble Sig Sauer MPX submachine guns,
capable of firing 850 rounds a minute, from "kits" made of parts
produced by the company. All told, as of January, \$29.3 million in guns
and gun parts had been exported from Sig Sauer and other New Hampshire
manufacturers to Mexico since April 2015, according to Census Bureau
trade records --- meaning that Sig Sauer has at least \$235 million left
in sales to make before its license expires in 2024.

Since 2014, the Mexican military has sold 1,400 U.S.-produced Sig Sauer
firearms to police in 18 Mexican states, including states where there is
an extensive record of collusion with organized crime.

On its end, since 2014, the Mexican military has sold 1,400
U.S.-produced Sig Sauer firearms to police in 18 Mexican states,
including states where there is an extensive record of collusion with
organized crime, such as Tamaulipas, Michoacán, and Chihuahua, SEDENA
records show. **[State authorities]{.underline}** also **[distribute
these weapons to local police]{.underline}**; **[in the state of
Mexi]{.underline}**co, for example**[, Sig Sauer weapons were sold to
police in five municipalities]{.underline}**, while Colt weapons went to
three other municipalities, as well as state police, according to a
state police document.

According to data recently released by the Mexican military, **[other
U.S. gun producers]{.underline}** that **[have exported thousands of
firearms]{.underline}** each **[to Mexico]{.underline}** **[for use by
the police or private individuals]{.underline}** include: Colt,
Bushmaster, Mossberg, Smith & Wesson, DS Arms, Remington, and Browning.
**[The Mexican military has]{.underline}** also **[purchased military
weapons from U.S. producers Nammo Talley, Barrett Firearms, and Knight
Armament Company]{.underline}** since 2014. In Veracruz, the police
responsible for at least 15 death squad murders purchased, since 2013,
at least 674 firearms exported by three U.S. arms companies: Colt,
Bushmaster, and Combined Systems, according to the Veracruz public
security secretariat. Local police in Veracruz also obtained weapons
from Sig Sauer and Connecticut-based Mossberg.

**[Beyond guns]{.underline}**, U.S. Census Bureau trade data show that
just over \$**[8.3 million in military explosives were delivered to
Mexico]{.underline}** from Arizona in September and October 2017, more
than in any year in the last decade for all states combined. (In all of
2016, military explosives exported from the entire United States to
Mexico amounted to less than \$800,000.) The Census records do not
indicate which company exported the explosives. In addition, **[Milkor
USA, based in Tucson, sold M32A1 grenade launchers used by the Mexican
military special forces. In 2017, more than \$5 million worth of grenade
launchers were exported to Mexico from Texas alone.]{.underline}**

**[[The permissive U.S. attitude toward gun exports has
prompted]{.mark}]{.underline}** several **[[gun producers based in
the]{.mark} [E]{.mark}]{.underline}**uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion **[[to beef up production in
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, thus **[[evading]{.mark} EU
[restrictions]{.mark} [on]{.mark} arms sales to countries [with
widespread]{.mark} violence or [human rights
violations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Sig Sauer]{.underline}**, for
instance, **[whose parent company is in Germany,]{.underline}** more
than **[quadrupled global exports from the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates between 2009 and 2016,
according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
(Germany stopped approving licenses for gun exports to Mexico after
2010.) Beretta (Italy) and Glock (Austria) produce guns in Tennessee and
Georgia, respectively, and are the two brands that Mexico has imported
in the largest numbers since 2007, per SEDENA records. The State
Department in February 2016 issued a license to Glock to export more
than 11,000 9mm and .45 caliber pistols from its Smyrna, Georgia,
facility for re-sale to Mexican police.

pistols]{.underline}** and sniper rifles with silencers at the Game and
Fish Expo in Arizona - a state that is ground zero for the legal and
illegal export of guns to Mexico.

**[[The legal export of guns by US gun producers to Mexican police
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[feeding criminal activities and the
illegal gun market]{.mark} in Mexico]{.underline}**, in several ways.
**[The Mexican military is the only legal importer of firearms in
Mexico]{.underline}**; **[in turn, it sells weapons to police throughout
the country, and]{.underline}**, to a lesser extent, **[to private
individuals and security companies.]{.underline}**

State and local **[police in Mexico]{.underline}** have **[had more than
20,000 firearms go missing or stolen]{.underline}** since 2006,
according to Mexican military documents. **[More than 8,000 rifles and
handguns disappeared]{.underline}** **[during that time from police
arsenals]{.underline}** in the city and state of Mexico and Guerrero
state alone. **[In Guerrero, infamous for corruption and human rights
violations]{.underline}** by its police and military, **[out of every
five firearms legally acquired by police, more than one went missing or
stolen.]{.underline}**

**[[US exports of weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the Mexican armed

violations]{.underline}**. The local police who attacked students from
the Ayotzinapa teachers school and disappeared 43 of them in 2014, for
example, were armed with AR-15 rifles exported by Colt Industries in
Connecticut, according to court records.

**[[When police collude with criminal organisations]{.mark} by giving

#### Cartels cause Mexican collapse -- that causes US draw-in -- makes allied prolif and great power war inevitable

Robert **Haddick 10**, Managing Editor of the Small Wars Journal, This
Week at War: If Mexico Is at War, Does America Have to Win It?, Sept
10, <http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/09/10/this_week_at_war_if_mexico_is_at_war_does_america_have_to_win_it>

While answering a question on Mexico this week at the Council on Foreign
Relations, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, \"We face an
increasing threat from a well-organized
network, drug-trafficking threat that is, in some cases, morphing
into, or making common cause with, what we would consider an
insurgency.\" Mexico\'s foreign minister Patricia Espinosa was quick to
dispute this characterization, arguing that Mexico\'s drug cartels have
no political agenda. But as I have previously discussed, the cartels,
evidenced by their attacks on both the government and the media, are
gradually becoming political insurgents as a means of defending their
turf.¶ I note that Clinton used the phrase \"We \[the United States\]
face an increasing threat \...,\" not \"they \[Mexico\].\" The cartels
are transnational shipping businesses, with consumers in the United
States as their dominant market.The clashes over shipping routes and
distribution power \-- which over the past four years have killed 28,000
and thoroughly corrupted Mexico\'s police and judiciary \--could just as
well occur inside the United States. Indeed, growing anxiety that
southern Arizona is in danger of becoming a \"no-go zone\" controlled by
drug and human traffickers contributed to the passage of Arizona\'s
controversial immigration enforcement statute earlier this year.¶ Both
Clinton and Mexican officials have discussed Colombia\'s struggle
against extreme drug violence and corruption, revealing concerns about
how dreadful the situation in Mexico might yet become and also as a
model for how to recover from disaster. Colombia\'s long climb from the
abyss, aided by the U.S. government\'s Plan Colombia assistance, should
certainly give hope to Mexico\'s counterinsurgents. But if the United
States and Mexico are to achieve similar success, both will have to
resolve political dilemmas that would prevent effective action. Clinton
herself acknowledged as much when she remarked that Plan Colombia was
\"controversial \... there were problems and there were mistakes. But it
worked.\"¶ Isolating Mexico\'s cartel insurgents from their enormous
American revenue base \-- **a crucial step in a counterinsurgency
campaign** \-- may require a much more severe border crackdown, an
action that would be highly controversial in both the United States and
Mexico. Plan Colombia was a success partly because of the long-term
presence of U.S. Special Forces advisers, intelligence experts, and
other military specialists inside Colombia, a presence which would not
please most Mexicans. And Colombia\'s long counterattack against its
insurgents resulted in actions that boiled the blood of many human
rights observers.¶ Most significantly, a strengthening Mexican
insurgency would **very likely affect America\'s role in the rest of
the world.** An increasingly chaotic American side of the border, marked
by bloody cartel wars, corrupted government and media, and a breakdown
in security, would likely cause many in the United States to question
the importance of military and foreign policy ventures elsewhere in the
world.¶Should the southern border become a U.S. president\'s
primary national security concern, **nervous allies and opportunistic
adversaries elsewhere in the world would no doubt adjust to a distracted
and inward-looking America, with potentiallydisruptive arms races the
result.** Secretary Clinton has looked south and now sees an insurgency.
Let\'s hope that the United States can apply what it has recently
learned about insurgencies to stop this one from getting out of control.

### Yemen -- Biodiversity

#### Oil tanker SAFER FSO will inevitably collapse unless the Yemen conflict ends\-\--it's key to Red Sea biodiversity

**[Weir]{.underline}** **[19]{.underline}** (Doug Weir, Research and
Policy Director at the Conflict and Environment Observatory, 5-15-2018,

On the 7th March, **[the [Yemen]{.mark}i government [called for
international assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[in dealing with a
potentially serious oil pollution threat]{.mark} in the Red
Sea.]{.underline}** **[The case has]{.underline}** **[served to
highlight the wider threat from terrestrial]{.underline}** **[and marine
oil pollution in Yemen's civil]{.underline}** war and the risks it poses
to the Red Sea's ecology. However **[dealing with the threat will be
impossible without cooperation between the parties to the conflict and
the international community.]{.underline}**

The SAFER Floating Storage and Offloading terminal

In March, **[Yemen's state news agency Saba]{.underline}**
**[reported]{.underline}** that **[the Minister of Foreign
Affairs]{.underline}** Abdulmalik al-Mikhlafi **[had written to the UN
Secretary General to appeal for international assistance]{.underline}**
in dealing **[with]{.underline}** an ageing Floating Storage and
Offloading (FSO) terminal moored off the coast of Ras Isa on Yemen's
west coast. The minister argued that the **[[SAFER FSO was in a]{.mark}
"bad and [deteriorating situation" and]{.mark} threatened [an "imminent
environmental]{.mark} and humanitarian [catastrophe]{.mark} in the Red
Sea".]{.underline}** He urged the UN to identify the appropriate
capacity for an evaluation of the tanker and for its maintenance.

The SAFER Floating Storage and Offloading vessel is moored 4 nautical
miles off the coast of Ras Isa.

**[The SAFER FSO]{.underline}** export terminal **[is a converted single
hulled oil tanker]{.underline}** (formerly the "ESSO Japan" built in
1976) that began operating as an FSO in 1988. It is owned and managed by
Yemen's national SAFER Exploration & Production Operations Company
(SEPOC). The tanker, which is fitted with a "turret" that connects it to
a pipeline, allows vessels to moor offshore and transfer oil extracted
and processed from SEPOC's operations in the Marib oil field in central
Yemen. The vessel, which is 360m long and 70m wide, contains 34 crude
oil tanks of different sizes and volumes, amounting to a total capacity
of around 3m barrels. The Marib-Ras Isa pipeline that feeds it stretches
for 430km and, under normal operation, transported 200,000 barrels a
day, with a maximum capacity of 400,000. The pipeline was built to
transport the majority of the output of the 416 wells processed by
SEPOC's Central Production Unit in Marib. **[The]{.underline}**
**[platform]{.underline}** and pipeline **[are Yemen's main export route
for light crude oil.]{.underline}**

Beyond the statement from the Yemeni government, **[[the current status
of the SAFER FSO is unclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The oil export
terminal off the coast of Ras Isa has been closed since March 2015 after
the region fell under the control of Houthi forces. **[Even if it had
been kept open by the Houthis, the UNSC-backed blockade on shipping
would turn away tankers seeking to collect oil]{.underline}**. **[The
unavailability of diesel fuel has meant that SAFER FSO's engines have
not been started for several years]{.underline}**, **[and [the structure
has been exposed to humidity and corrosion]{.mark}]{.underline}** with
little maintenance. Media reports suggest that **[the Houthis have been
unwilling to unload the vessel,]{.underline}** although the government
have urged them to do so, **[because they are blocked from exporting the
oil]{.underline}** it contains. **[As an old vessel]{.underline}**, with
a single hull it is likely to be at particular risk from corrosion and
in spite of the production interruptions caused by the conflict, **[it
is thought that it may still contain around 1.14m barrels of crude --
for comparison the Exxon Valdez disaster involved 260,000
barrels.]{.underline}**

The nearby Al-Salif port, which was used for vital imports of foodstuffs
and diesel, was closed by the government in summer 2017 after a period
of tightened restrictions on arriving tankers importing fuel. Fuel
storage areas at the port had also been bombed by the Saudi coalition in
2016. The reason given by the coalition-backed Yemeni government for the
port's closure in 2017 was to protect the "marine environment" from
"pollution and oil leaks", but appeared to be primarily focused on
reducing port revenues to the Houthis. While the World Food Programme
reports that As Salif port is currently open, it is suspected that the
areas of the peninsula that is home to both the port and export terminal
have been mined.

Control and exploitation of pipelines

The Marib-Ras Isa pipeline that feeds the Ras Isa terminal has also been
closed as it crosses the frontline from government to Houthi controlled
areas, although SEPOC has reported that limited pumping has taken place
from time to time to prevent corrosion. The pipeline, much of which is
in Houthi-controlled Hodeidah province, has a long history of attacks
and sabotage that predates the current conflict but which have continued
since 2015. Local people have also increasingly turned to bunkering oil
from the pipeline, with an incident near Bajel in 2017 killing 12 and
injuring 29.

Earlier this year, a leaked document revealed that **[the Houthis
planned to extract the crude remaining in the pipeline]{.underline}**.
The light Bent crude from the Marib field can be used unprocessed in the
diesel generators that are widely used for irrigation pumps in Yemen,
and the Houthis allegedly planned to raise US\$42m by selling 600,000
barrels to Yemen's Agricultural Cooperative Union. The plans drew
criticism from SEPOC and the government, who argued that extracting oil
from points along the pipeline would cause serious harm to a critical
part of Yemen's economic infrastructure and risk damaging the
environment. While the extent of the localised pollution caused by
attacks on the pipeline and other forms of damage during the conflict
has yet to assessed, it seems likely to be significant.

Oil pollution and Red Sea Marine Protected Areas

In 2016, around 4.8m barrels of crude oil and refined petroleum products
were shipped through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea daily. While few
large oil spills have occurred, smaller spills have been common, whether
caused by groundings, transfers between vessels at sea, offshore oil
production or discharges of ballast water. Water quality studies have
suggested that the Red Sea receives more oil per square kilometre than
any other region, in spite of it being designated a Special Area under
the MARPOL convention on marine pollution.

Although facing a range of human pressures, **[[the Red Sea remains
highly biodiverse]{.mark}, with coral reefs, coastal mangroves and many
endemic species.]{.underline}** But **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[restricted water circulation, and fragile marine ecosystems, the Red
Sea is particularly vulnerable to oil pollution]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The Regional Organisation for the Conservation of the Environment of the
Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (**[PERSGA]{.underline}**) -- an
intergovernmental body dedicated to the conservation of the coastal and
marine environments found in the Red Sea, **[has promoted efforts to
strengthen oil spill response systems in Yemen]{.underline}** but it is
unclear how these have fared from the conflict's impact on environmental
governance. Commentators have suggested that Yemen's Maritime Affairs
Authority, which is tasked with controlling marine pollution, is not at
a sufficient state of readiness to fulfil its mandate. It also seems
inevitable that the conflict would limit access to affected areas,
restrict the availability of equipment necessary to tackle serious
spills and would constrain the provision of international assistance in
the event of a major spill.

PERSGA has also promoted the development of Marine Protected Areas off
the Yemen coast. One of these, Kamaran Island, which was formally
declared in 2009, lies around 14km north of where the SAFER FSO is
moored. **[Recent biodiversity assessments of the island have found its
mangrove habitats to be largely]{.underline}** untouched and in near
natural condition, certainly in comparison to many other coastal sites
in Yemen that have been affected by felling, clearance for development
and pollution. Kamaran's coral reefs are also in good condition and both
the reefs and mangroves support local fisheries. With relatively few
Marine Protected Areas, Kamaran, together with the UNESCO heritage site
of Socotra, has been the focus of past efforts by the UNDP and others to
enhance marine biodiversity protection in Yemen.

The ageing SAFER FSO is not the only source of marine oil pollution
risks linked to the conflict. On April 3rd, the Abqaiq, a Saudi
registered oil tanker carrying 2m barrels of oil was targeted by the
Houthis off the coast of Hodeidah. Although damage was slight, the
incident marked a change in strategy for the Houthis, who have generally
restricted their attacks to naval vessels. Similarly in 2017 reports
began to emerge of the deployment of naval mines and Marine-Borne
Improvised Explosive Devices (MBIEDs) by the Houthis off the Yemeni
coast. While some were moored, the majority appear to have been free
floating and these too present serious marine pollution risks in the
event of a tanker being struck. With the Saudi coalition looking to
retake the port of Hodeidah this year it's possible the Houthis may
intensify attacks against shipping.

A politicised environment

The Yemeni government's call for assistance over the SAFER FSO is not
the first time that the environmental risks from damage to shipping or
Yemen's oil infrastructure have been raised during the conflict. In
addition to the warnings over pipeline damage, and the justifications
for port closures, earlier this year a Saudi diplomat alleged that the
Houthis had seized 19 oil tankers off the coast of Yemen and were
planning to destroy the ships to create "an environmental disaster in
the Red Sea". The claims were found to be untrue after an open source
investigation by TankerTrackers revealed that the tankers were operating
normally.

**[While it is clear that the ageing, single hulled SAFER
FSO]{.underline}** **[may]{.underline}** well **[present a serious
pollution risk]{.underline}** to Kamaran Island's Marine Protected Area,
the marine ecosystem around Ras Isa and the wider Red Sea**[, [it is
less clear what support the international community can provide while
the conflict continues]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Access]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** **[a technical assessment of the vessel is a
priority to gauge the threat it poses, and whether any crude oil leaks
would be gradual or catastrophic]{.underline}**. But the question of how
it can be unloaded, and what will happen to the 1.14m barrels of crude
it is thought to contain, is unclear. **[[Unloading the vessel would
require cooperation between the UN, the Saudi coalition and Yemeni
gov]{.mark}ernment, [and the Houthis]{.mark} who still control the
export terminal.]{.underline}**

With the conflict ongoing and the environment already subject to
politicisation, **[the chances that the parties to the conflict will
reach agreement that the SAFER FSO poses an unacceptable environmental
and economic risk, and take concerted action to mitigate those risks,
seem slim.]{.underline}**

#### An oil spill will unleash an environmental apocalypse

**[Osberg 19]{.underline}** (Spencer Osberg and Hannah Patchett are

Throughout April and May **[there has been rising concern that an oil
terminal offshore of Ras Issa port]{.underline}**,
**[which]{.underline}** **[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** fallen into
disuse **[with [more than 1 million barrels]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
crude oil onboard, **[will unleash an environmental disaster in the Red
Sea.]{.underline}**

**[The]{.underline}** Floating Storage and Offloading
(**[FSO]{.underline}**) terminal, owned by Yemen's national oil company
**[SAFER]{.underline}** Exploration and Production Operation Company --
more commonly known as SAFER -- **[is a converted single-hulled oil
tanker,]{.underline}** built in Japan in 1976, **[with the capacity to
hold]{.underline}** some **[3 million barrels]{.underline}** of oil.
Yemen first acquired the vessel in 1986 and subsequently SAFER
permanently moored it some four nautical miles offshore of Ras Issa
port, attached it to 430-kilometer-long pipeline, and installed
equipment allowing for the transfer of crude oil to other tanker
vessels. **[FSO SAFER subsequently became Yemen's primary export point
for light crude, which originated from more than 400 SAFER wells in
Marib governorate's Block 18.]{.underline}**

**[Initially]{.underline}** **[envisioned as a temporary measure to
facilitate Yemen's oil exports]{.underline}**, in the decades since FSO
SAFER went into operations the planned construction of a land-based
export terminal at Ras Issa did not materialize. Following the
escalation of the ongoing conflict in March 2015, the Marib--Ras Issa
pipeline ceased operations and exports from FSO SAFER halted.

**[[The UN estimates]{.underline}]{.mark}** that some **[[1.12 million
barrels]{.mark} of oil [remained]{.mark} onboard]{.underline}**, while a
former SAFER official who spoke with the Sana'a Center said the amount
ranges from 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels. In either case, **[[it
is more than four times the amount of oil]{.mark} released in
the]{.underline}** 1989 **[Exxon]{.underline}** **[Valdez oil
spill]{.underline}**, widely regarded as one of the worst man-made
environmental disasters in history. **[[The Red
Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- which **[[supports a high level of marine
biodiversity]{.mark} as well as fishing and tour]{.underline}**ism
industries in eight bordering countries -- **[[is a far smaller]{.mark}
and more contained bod[y of]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[water
than]{.mark} the North Pacific [where the Exxon Valdez]{.mark}
disaster]{.underline}** **[occurred]{.underline}**, **[meaning an oil
spill of a comparable quantity would have a far more concentrated impact
on the areas it reached.]{.underline}**

Following the halt in exports from FSO SAFER in 2015, staff were
withdrawn and regular maintenance ended. **[Published estimates
indicated]{.underline}** that **[the aging vessel]{.underline}** **[had
previously required some US\$10 million]{.underline}** in annual
maintenance. **[The onboard generators subsequently]{.underline}**
**[ceased functioning due to a lack of diesel]{.underline}**, meaning
they were no longer able to pump inert gas into the holding tanks. Thus,
for four years, **[highly flammable and explosive gasses emitted from
the crude oil have likely been building up in those
tanks.]{.underline}**

#### Loss of biodiversity causes extinction

Million Species, Warns UN Draft Report", Ecology Global Network,

On the heels of an Earth Day that featured calls for radical action to
address the current "age of environmental breakdown," Agence
France-Presse revealed Tuesday that up to **[a million species face
possible extinction because of destructive human
behavior.]{.underline}**

**[The warning comes from]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}** forthcoming
United Nations report, a draft of which was obtained by AFP, that
"**[painstakingly catalogues how humanity has undermined the natural
resources upon which its very survival depends."]{.underline}**

A product of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the landmark three-year
assessment was prepared by 150 experts from 50 countries, with additions
from another 250 contributors.

As John Vidal wrote in a preview of the study for HuffPost last month,
"It is the greatest attempt yet to assess the state of life on Earth and
will show how tens of thousands of species are at high risk of
extinction, how countries are using nature at a rate that far exceeds
its ability to renew itself, and how nature's ability to contribute food
and fresh water to a growing human population is being compromised in
every region on Earth."

Outlining some of the experts' key findings, AFP reported Tuesday:

The accelerating loss of clean air, drinkable water, CO2-absorbing
forests, pollinating insects, protein-rich fish, and storm-blocking
mangroves---to name but a few of the dwindling services rendered by
nature---poses no less of a threat than climate change...

The direct causes of species loss, in order of importance, are shrinking
habitat and land-use change, hunting for food or illicit trade in body
parts, climate change, pollution, and alien species such as rats,
mosquitoes, and snakes that hitch rides on ships or planes, the report
finds.

Although IPBES chair Robert Watson declined to divulge the new report's
details to AFP, he said that "there are also two big indirect drivers of
biodiversity loss and climate change---the number of people in the world
and their growing ability to consume."

"We **[need to recognize that climate change and loss of nature are
equally important, not just for the environment, but as development and
economic issues as well," Watson added. "The way we produce our food and
energy is undermining]{.underline}** the regulating services that we get
from nature."

As AFP reported, the draft document warns that "subsidies to fisheries,
industrial agriculture, livestock raising, forestry, mining and the
production of biofuel, or fossil fuel energy encourage waste,
inefficiency, and over-consumption."

**[Unsustainable human activity,]{.underline}** according to the
document, already has "**[severely altered" 40 percent of the marine
environment, 50 percent of inland waterways, and three-quarters of the
planet's land.]{.underline}**

Looking ahead, the report says that "**[half-a-million to a million
species are projected to be threatened with extinction,]{.underline}**
many within decades." It also warns that **[indigenous peoples and poor
communities---who are already at risk because of the global climate
crisis---will be negatively impacted by biodiversity
loss]{.underline}**.

"**[The loss of species, ecosystems, and genetic diversity
is]{.underline}** already **[a global and generational threat to human
well-being]{.underline}**," Watson said in a statement from IPBES.
"**[Protecting the invaluable contributions of nature to people will be
the defining challenge of decades to come]{.underline}**. **[Policies,
efforts, and actions]{.underline}**---at every level---**[will only
succeed]{.underline}**, however, **[when based on the best knowledge and
evidence]{.underline}**. This is what the IPBES Global Assessment
provides."

birds]{.underline}** (Haney, Geiger, & Short, 2014), 95,000 to 200,000
sea turtles (Hale et al., 2017), **[and reduced big reef and demersal
fish biomass by 25% to 50% and 40% to 70% respectively]{.underline}**
(Ainsworth et al., 2018). Since 2010, nesting numbers of the critically
endangered Kemp\'s Ridley turtles, whose adult population is mostly
limited to the Gulf of Mexico has decreased (Putman et al., 2015). A
review of museum records shows that at least half of the endemic fish
species of the Gulf of Mexico have not been recorded after 2010
(Chakrabarty, O\'Neill, Hardy, & Ballengee, 2016). This is of particular
importance as the massive loss of individuals, or of a specific
taxonomic group, can cause serious changes to ecosystems.

Our study shows **[the continuous increase in the overlap between both
shallow and deep‐sea ecosystems with hydrocarbon activities through
time]{.underline}**. Protecting coastal and deep‐sea ecosystems is
crucial as they provide important ecosystem services such as tourism,
fisheries, and climate regulation (Alongi, 2012; Drakou, Pendleton,
Effron, Ingram, & Teneva, 2017; Ramirez‐Llodra et al., 2011; Sanderman
et al., 2018; Spalding et al., 2017; Thurber et al., 2014). Coastal
habitats assessed in this study have between 10% and 25% of their
distribution overlapping hydrocarbon operations. On the other hand,
**[the percent distribution of deep‐sea ecosystems assessed in this
study overlapping hydrocarbon activities is lower than 5]{.underline}**%
(except for cold‐water coral reefs). While this difference in overlap
can be expected given that deep‐sea areas were not exploited by the
offshore industry until the mid‐1990, the comparison is limited given
the paucity of deep‐sea biodiversity data (Webb, Vanden Berghe, &
O\'Dor, 2010), **[which limits the reliability of biodiversity
distribution estimates that we have available for this part of the
ocean]{.underline}** (Vierod, Guinotte, & Davies, 2014). Nevertheless,
**[acute and chronic threats from hydrocarbon activities to deep‐sea
areas are of great concern to marine ecosystems]{.underline}** managers,
as species inhabiting these areas are characterised by slower metabolic,
growth, and reproduction rates (Glover & Smith, 2003; Ramirez‐Llodra et
al., 2011). Thus, **[threats from hydrocarbon activities to deep‐sea
areas could translate into severe impacts and slow ecosystem
recovery]{.underline}**. Recent calls and approaches for conserving
deep‐sea ecosystems (Ban et al., 2014; Danovaro et al., 2017; Levin,
Kark, & Danovaro, 2018; Taranto, Kvile, Pitcher, & Morato, 2012;
Venegas‐Li, Levin, Possingham, & Kark, 2018; Wedding et al., 2013;
Wright et al., 2019) need to be addressed and applied if negative
impacts from activities such as hydrocarbon exploitation are to be
minimized.

**[Two thirds of the places where hydrocarbon activities occur in the
ocean overlap]{.underline}** with areas of high values for the three
indices of biodiversity we assessed. For example, the **[proportional
range rarity index allowed us to identify regions important for
range‐restricted species such as [the North East Atlantic, the eastern
Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which
otherwise would have been missed in the case of only using indices
dependent on species richness. **[To avoid]{.underline}** important
**[damages to global biodiversity]{.underline}**, **[these
areas]{.underline}** of high conservation value **[should be granted the
highest standards of environmental stewardship]{.underline}**.
**[Long‐term monitoring programs]{.underline}** in these areas would
help to better understand both marine biology and the effects of
hydrocarbon activities on it, **[and could inform present and future
conservation actions]{.underline}**. Special attention should be made
into updating oil spill contingency, response, and restoration protocols
in areas of exceptional biodiversity

obligations on exporting]{.underline}]{.mark}**, importing, transit and
trans-shipment states **[[to ensure arms transfers do not
exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark}** such
**[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The following examines these risks
in more depth, as well as their relevance to the ATT. a. Risks to Peace
and Security and of Terrorism The ATT requires exporting States Parties
to "assess the potential" that a transfer of conventional weapons,
ammunition or parts and components "would...undermine peace and
security" (Article 7.1(a)) or be used to "commit or facilitate ...
terrorism" (Article 7.1 (b, iii)). If so, **[exporters are required to
engage in risk mitigation measures in collaboration]{.underline}** with
the importing State (Article 7.2). **[If an "overriding risk" remains,
then the exporter "shall not" authorize the transfer. States Parties
are]{.underline}** also **[required]{.underline}** **[to "take measures
to prevent" diversion of arms to unauthorized users or
uses]{.underline}** (Article 11).

**[[Wildlife poaching]{.mark} can [pose a risk to]{.mark} peace and
[security by undermining]{.mark} the [rule of law, fueling]{.mark} the
depth and reach of [organized crime, contributing to SALW proliferation
and providing funds to Non-State Armed Groups]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Media and **[think tank reports of varying reliability]{.underline}**
**[have]{.underline}** **[alleged]{.underline}** that **[wildlife
poaching has helped fund armed groups,]{.underline}** **[including the
Janjaweed in Sudan]{.underline}**, **[Mai Mai in the]{.underline}**
Democratic Republic of the **[Congo]{.underline}** **[and the Lord's
Resistance Army]{.underline}** (LRA) **[in]{.underline}** **[the central
Africa]{.underline}**n region.9 In 2013, US President Barack **[Obama
signed Executive Order 13648, which described wildlife trafficking as
"contributing to the illegal economy, fueling instability, and
undermining security]{.underline}**."10 In his 2014 remarks to the UN
General Assembly, Tanzanian President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete stated that
"**[poaching" and "illicit exploitation of natural resources" are
"making the world less secure]{.underline}**."11 Similarly, UN Secretary
General Ban Kimoon has stated that "Illegal wildlife trade undermines
the rule of law and threatens national security."12 The UN Security
Council has also identified wildlife poaching in central Africa as a
security threat, establishing travel and financial sanctions on persons
and organizations involved "illicit exploitation of natural resources,
including diamonds and wildlife and wildlife products" (S/RES/2134,
S/RES/2136 and S/RES/2198).

However, the increasing tendency to see wildlife poaching through a
security lens has encouraged calls to militarize wildlife protection,
described as a "war against poaching."13 In conversations with wildlife
rangers in Kenya, the author often heard them use this militarized
language of a "war" or "fighting the enemy." **[[Exaggerated
claims]{.mark} that [poaching funds terrorism have strengthened]{.mark}
those interests]{.underline}** **[benefiting from [an aggressive
posture]{.mark} and escalating clashes [between poachers and
anti-poaching units]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[spurred an arms
race]{.underline}**, **[with increasingly sophisticated weaponry used on
both sides]{.underline}**]{.mark}.14 Meanwhile, **[the depiction of
poachers as nonstate actors]{.underline}** **[and criminals
elides]{.underline}** what are often extensive links between security
forces and wildlife poaching, **[ranging from direct involvement to
accepting kickbacks or supplying the military-grade
weapons]{.underline}** (including M-16 and G3 rifles) **[increasingly
used by poachers]{.underline}**.15 **[Militarization
strengthens]{.underline}** the hands of actors that can **[contribute to
insecurity and increases flows of weapons into already unstable
contexts.]{.underline}**

b\. Violations of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law

Similar to its provisions on peace and security, **[the ATT requires
assessment]{.underline}** **[and mitigation of risks that transfers of
conventional weapons]{.underline}**, ammunition or parts and components
"could be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation" of
international human rights and humanitarian law (Article 7.1(b i, ii)).
However, it also contains more stringent prohibitions of any transfers
of arms if a State Party "has knowledge" that they "would be used in the
commission" of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes (Article
6.3).

Several of the **[[armed groups]{.underline}]{.mark}** that have
allegedly **[[funded]{.mark} [their activities in]{.mark} part [by
wildlife poaching]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[[including in DRC, Sudan
and Central African Republic]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- have engaged in
serious human rights and humanitarian law violations.16 Meanwhile,
**[[militarized counter-poaching]{.mark} [efforts have]{.mark} had [a
disturbing tendency to exacerbate extrajudicial
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, sometimes **[used to cover up official
complicity in wildlife trafficking]{.underline}**.17 Shoot-to-kill
operations by anti-poaching units have resulted in major abuses of human
rights.18 Indeed, **[[they]{.underline}]{.mark}** may
**[[undermine]{.mark} important [efforts to]{.mark} engage and [build
local capacities for]{.mark} sustainability, [peace]{.mark} and
alternative livelihoods]{.underline}**.19

c\. Poaching and Organized Crime

**[The ATT requires]{.underline}** **[States]{.underline}** Parties
**[to assess and mitigate the risk that a transfer of
arms,]{.underline}** ammunition or parts and components **[will be used
to "commit]{.underline}** or facilitate ... **[transnational organized
crime]{.underline}**" (Article 7.1 (b.iv)). States Parties are also
required to "take measures to prevent" diversion of arms to unauthorized
users or uses (Article 11).

**[Trade in wildlife is regulated by CITES, which governs
the]{.underline}** import, **[export]{.underline}** and trans-shipment
**[of specimens]{.underline}** of controlled species. Despite the many
successes of CITES in limiting illegal trafficking, in its 2014 report,
**[The Environmental Crime Crisis]{.underline}**, the UN Environment
Programme (UNEP) **[raised alarm at the "pace, level of sophistication,
and globalized nature" of the illegal trade in
wildlife]{.underline}**,20 now **[the world's fifth largest black
market]{.underline}**.21 In 2013, the UN Commission on Crime Prevention
and Criminal Justice designated **[wildlife trafficking as a "serious
crime."]{.underline}**22 Since then, the UN Environment Assembly
(UNEP/EA.1/L.16) and the UN General Assembly (A/RES/69/314) have both
passed resolutions calling on states to take measures against organized
crime networks involved in poaching and illicit wildlife trafficking.
Media, academic and think tank reports have alleged official complicity
and corruption linking elements of several states to such transnational
networks.23

#### OP solvency card for ATT in general.

**[Bolton 16]{.underline}** (Matthew Bolton, Associate Professor of
Political Science at Pace University, September 2016, "How to Use the
Arms Trade Treaty to Address Wildlife Crime", UNSCAR,

accessed 7-15-2019) wl

In addition to requiring States Parties to assess risk of weapons
transfers being abused, it requires them to address such risks through
the "establishment of mitigation measures such as Participants gather at
the ATT Civil Society Strategic Planning Seminar in Nairobi, Kenya on
June 17, 2016 7 confidence-building measures or jointly developed and
agreed programmes by the exporting and importing States" (Article 11.2).
It encourages States Parties to engage in "international cooperation",
information-sharing and provision of "international assistance"
(including through a newly established "voluntary trust fund") (Articles
15 and 16). ATT States Parties are also required to meet in annual
Conferences of States Parties to review implementation. These provisions
offer opportunities to address the negative impact of the arms trade on
wildlife crime and also mitigate problems with militarized
counter-poaching efforts. The following offers a few examples of
potential measures that could be instituted through the framework of ATT
implementation. It is by no means an exhaustive list, but rather
intended to encourage creative innovation by States and civil society.

a\. Identification of Types of Weapons Being Abused

Key to many of the potential risk mitigation measures is identifying the
types of weapons and ammunition being used in poaching, by the groups
and networks benefiting from illicit wildlife trafficking, as well as
those weapons contributing to the militarization of wildlife protection.
A review of the relevant media, policy and academic literature, as well
as interviews with wildlife rangers in Kenya suggests that poaching
networks are using increasingly sophisticated an military-grade
equipment. This includes Kalashnikov-pattern rifles (including the AK-47
and AK-101), G-3 and M-16-pattern automatic rifles, rocket-propelled
grenades, as well as largecaliber rifles (including .375 and .404) like
the CZ550 and others that can accommodate Winchester Magnum .458
ammunition. Poachers are also increasingly fitting such their rifles
with telescopic sights and silencers and using GPS units, radios and
night-vision goggles. Government counter-poaching units are often armed
with similar weapons, particularly Kalashnikov, G-3 and M-16 pattern
automatic rifles.29

Gathering specific information on the types of such weapons, their
distribution, movement and use is crucial to enable ATT-mandated control
measures. One potentially useful mechanism is the CITES-mandated
Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) program, which
requires States to report forensic and other data on every illegal
elephant killing. The MIKE reporting form allows States to record and
report the types of weapons and ammunition used but unfortunately, poor
marking of weapons stocks in the region and anti-poaching units' low
forensic capacity have limited the quality of this data.30 Other
potential sources of information include police and military data on
illegal firearms, as well as regional institutions engaged in
cooperation on countering SALW proliferation (like the Regional Centre
on Small Arms (RECSA) in East Africa), as well as conservation (like the
Lusaka Agreement Task Force).31 Information sharing is thus crucial at
the annual ATT Conferences of States Parties and the triannual CITES
Conferences of Parties.

b\. Improving Export, Import, Transit and Trans-Shipment Controls

The ATT requires all States Parties to "establish and maintain a
national control system, including a national control list" (Article
5.2) of weapons to which it will apply the provisions of the Treaty. The
national control list must at a minimum cover the primary categories of
conventional weapons in Article 2(1) of the Treaty, but States Parties
are apply the ATT to "the broadest range of conventional arms" (Article
5.3). While the ATT does not define the categories of weapons it covers,
including of SALW, it refers States Parties to the "descriptions used"
in the UN Register of Conventional Arms and "relevant United Nations
instruments", for example, the Firearms Protocol and International
Tracing Instrument. 8

One potential issue is that there is a debate about whether rifles that
are considered "sporting weapons" -- including some large-caliber
weapons used in poaching -- are included under the ATT category of SALW,
since the Preamble recognizes the "legitimate trade and lawful
ownership" of weapons for "recreational, cultural, historical and
sporting activities." Moreover, the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions
Control List (a list promoted by many as best practice), specifically
excludes "smooth-bore weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes"
(ML2a). Similarly, there is some uncertainty about the definition of
"Parts and Components" (Article 4) and whether all States Parties will
interpret it to cover sights, silencers and relevant security equipment
like night-vision goggles (silencers and most sights (ML1.d and ML2.c)
are included on the Wassenaar List). It is crucial that States Parties
include the weapons, ammunition, parts and components most at risk of
use in poaching -- as well as those most likely to be abused by
militarized wildlife counter-poaching units -- to be included in States'
National Control Lists. As noted above, the ATT encourages states to
include on their Lists the widest possible range of conventional
weapons, ammunition, parts and components.

States Parties can take a range of measures to improve control over the
transfer of the items on their National Control Lists, including:
building the capacity of customs enforcement; information gathering on
and law enforcement actions against trafficking networks; information
sharing between exporting, importing, transit and trans-shipment States;
and tightening oversight and control over the movements and storage of
weapons.

c\. Preventing Diversion

The ATT requires all States Parties to "take measures" to prevent
diversion of weapons to unauthorized uses or users, by "assessing the
risk" of diversion and establishing "mitigation measures such as
confidence-building measures or jointly developed and agreed programmes
by the exporting and importing States." It offers examples of "Other
prevention measures", including "examining parties involved in the
export, requiring additional documentation, certificates, assurances,
not authorizing the export or other appropriate measures" (Article 11).

The measures listed explicitly in the ATT are focused on trade
regulations. However, in implementing the UN PoA, Nairobi Protocol, SADC
SALW Protocol, ECOWAS SALW Convention and Kinshasa Convention, States
have taken many additional measures to limit diversion. These include
marking of both government and civilian firearms; registration and
tracing measures (like databases) to track to internal movement of
weapons; destruction of surplus weapons and ammunition; and improvements
to the security and management of stockpiles. Such measures could help
to prevent diversion of weapons, ammunition, parts and components to
networks involved in wildlife crime.

d\. Deepening Respect for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law

The International Committee of the Red Cross, national human rights and
humanitarian law commissions and civil society engage in programs to
encourage greater awareness of and compliance with international human
rights and humanitarian law. The international cooperation and
assistance provisions of the ATT (Articles 15 and 16) could be used to
encourage armed groups to comply with human rights and humanitarian
norms and to encourage better practice by police and wildlife protection
units. This could include sensitization and training; establishment of
stronger national legislation and institutions; clarifying rules of
engagement (such as demanding an end to "shoot-to-kill" policies against
9 poachers, instead encouraging rangers to make arrests where possible);
and monitoring by ombudspersons, media and civil society.

e\. Encouraging Transparency and Information Sharing

The ATT requires States Parties to "maintain national records" on
relevant transfers, encouraging them to include in these archives the
quantity, value, exporters, importers, transit and trans-shipment States
and end-users of the weapons, both authorized and actually transferred
(Article 12). States Parties are also to submit annual reports to the
ATT Secretariat on implementation (Article 13) and exchange "information
on matters of mutual interest regarding the implementation and
application" (Article 15). Many States and civil society have encouraged
States Parties to interpret these provisions as encouraging a norm of
transparency and openness about the international arms trade.32

Transparent reporting on transfers could be very useful in addressing
poaching networks, by enabling careful tracking of weapons most at risk
of being used in poaching. The international cooperation and assistance
measures of the ATT (Articles 15 and 16) and Conferences of States
Parties also offer opportunities for sharing of best practices in
addressing the impact of arms proliferation on wildlife crime. As noted
before, sharing of MIKE data on weapons used in poaching would improve
the work of both the arms control and conservation communities.

f\. Peacebuilding and Sustainable Development

Insecurity and poverty are key drivers of both poaching and SALW
proliferation. Illicit movements of SALW often diffuse in and out of
areas of conflict. A lack of livelihood opportunities in the legitimate
economy often provides incentives to engage in poaching. Reducing both
the supply and demand for weapons to be used in poaching and illicit
wildlife trafficking thus requires peacebuilding as well as sustainable
development efforts.33 ATT-mandated risk mitigation measures, as well as
the provisions for international cooperation and assistance provisions
(Articles 15 and 16) could be used to encourage community ownership of
conservation through development of sustainable livelihoods in wildlife
hotspots as well as to support and build peace in regions where there is
a nexus of poaching and armed conflict. Throughout East Africa,
community group, churches and local government have organized "Peace
Committees" to mitigate local-level conflict.34 Likewise, conservation
agencies have had varying success in engaging local communities in
wildlife protection, resulting in a growing literature on best
practice.35 Examples include the Northern Rangelands Trust in Kenya,
which has integrated peacebuilding into its conservation efforts,
supporting conflict resolution teams and community dialogues.36 The
Catholic Diocese of Eldoret in Kenya has facilitated grassroots
peacebuilding interventions among Pokot and Marakwet communities,
bordering South Turkana National Reserve and Kerio Valley National
Park.37

Around Lake Nakuru National Park in Kenya community groups have
partnered with Kenya Wildlife Service to increase access to water,
promoting sustainable rural livelihoods that reduce pressure on the
Park. With the influx of displaced people after the post-election
violence of 2007/2008, the Black Sheep Women's Group and Heart-to-Heart
Women's Group -- associations of women from around the Park -- have
built links between people of different ethnic groups through
community-based tourism projects. These include managing a campground,
offering cultural tours and making and selling handicrafts. Such
projects can contribute to building linkages between Parks and their
surrounding communities and 10 reducing social fissures that exacerbate
wildlife crime. Contributing to peacebuilding, conflict reduction and
income generation programs can reduce the demand for illicit weapons.

### Cattle Raiding

#### Cattle raiding fucks up Africa\-\--ATT solves

**[The transfer of weapons to regions severely affected by pastoralist
conflict poses risks to peace and security]{.underline}**, **[the rule
of law, international human rights and humanitarian
norms]{.underline}**. **[The ATT places obligations on
exporting]{.underline}**, importing, transit and trans-shipment states
**[to ensure arms transfers do not exacerbate]{.underline}** such
**[risks]{.underline}**. The following examines these risks in more
depth, as well as their relevance to the ATT.

**[a. Organized Crime, Cattle Raiding and Wildlife Crime]{.underline}**

**[[The ATT requires]{.mark} exporting [States]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Parties **[[to "assess the potential]{.underline}]{.mark}**" that **[[a
transfer of]{.mark} conventional [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
ammunition or parts and components **[[will]{.mark} be used to "commit
or [facilitate ... transnational organized]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[crime]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Article 7.1 (b.iv)). **[If so,
exporters are required to engage in risk mitigation
measures]{.underline}** in collaboration with the importing State
(Article 7.2). **[[If an "overriding risk"
remains]{.mark},]{.underline}** then **[[the exporter "shall not"
authorize the transfer]{.underline}]{.mark}**. States Parties are also
required to "take measures to prevent" diversion of arms to unauthorized
users or uses (Article 11).

While **[traditional [cattle raiding]{.mark}]{.underline}** in East
Africa was driven by concerns of raising dowry, replenishing stocks,
demonstrating bravery and taking revenge, in the last three decades it
**[has been transformed by a commercialization of the illicit cattle
trade]{.underline}**. **[Raiding [is]{.mark} now [connected to]{.mark}
regional and [global organized crime networks]{.mark} that traffic
stolen cattle to central marketplaces]{.underline}**, **[where they can
be 'laundered']{.underline}**.13 Indeed **[[there are significant
linkages between the movement of cattle, arms and]{.mark} other [illicit
goods]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including **[through similar transit
points]{.underline}**. **[[Cattle trading cartels are linked to
high-level political leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[who profit from
corruption]{.mark} and provide protection from
prosecution.]{.underline}** **[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** nexus **[has
[politicized cattle raiding]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
**[[turn]{.mark}ing gangs of [raiders into militias that]{.mark} can be
used to [punish leaders']{.mark} perceived
[rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}** and opponents. **[The distribution of
weapons]{.underline}** -- ostensibly to aid a community's protection
from raiding -- **[is diverted to buy the loyalty of criminal
gangs]{.underline}** involved in raiding.14

One of **[the most helpful examinations]{.underline}** **[for the link
between guns and cattle rustling]{.underline}** **[can be found in a
recent report by the Regional Centre on Small Arms (RECSA), in
Nairobi.]{.underline}** **[They found]{.underline}** that **[a "strong
correlation between cattle rustling and proliferation of illicit SALW
creates a vicious cycle where illicit SALW creates a more violent
business of cattle rustling]{.underline}**. **[This]{.underline}** in
turn **[leads to higher proceeds, which facilitates the acquisition of
more sophisticated illicit SALW]{.underline}**."15 RECSA found that
Kalashnikov-pattern rifles like the AK-47 are the most commonly used
weapons by cattle rustlers in the region.16 RECSA compiled regional
government statistics, which suggest that there were "650,000 illicit
SALW in circulation" in Kenya, "an estimated 320,000 guns (both licit
and illicit) in the hands of Ethiopian civilians", and between 15,000 to
200,000 "firearms in the hands of civilians in Uganda."17 Small Arms
Survey estimates the presence of 500,000 civilian firearms in Somaliland
and 720,000 in South Sudan.18 They also found ammunition from at least
25 countries circulating in the borderland between Kenya, Uganda and
South Sudan and suggested that much came from leaked state stocks.19 7

**[Several states in the East and Horn of]{.underline}** Africa
**[[region have reacted to the threat of cattle raiding gangs by
deploying military]{.underline}]{.mark}** or paramilitary
**[[forces]{.mark} in pastoralist communities]{.underline}**. However,
there have been several cases reported where **[[meat from cattle
raiding]{.mark} has been sold to military camps to [feed
troops]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[who]{.underline}**
**[may]{.underline}**]{.mark} in turn **[[be selling
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** and/or ammunition **[[to local
gangs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[States should be mindful of the
possibility that [maintaining a military presence]{.mark} among
pastoralist peoples]{.underline}** **[may actually
[fuel]{.mark}]{.underline}** both **[the [demand for meat and]{.mark}
the supply of [arms]{.mark}]{.underline}** and ammunition. **[[A
militarized state response to cattle crime]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[may]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[have unintended consequences
that]{.underline}** can [**[exacerbate]{.underline}** **[the
problem.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Indeed, **[military
forces]{.underline}** themselves **[have]{.underline}** been
**[implicated in cattle raiding in the East and Horn of Africa
region]{.underline}**.20

There are similar dynamics with the participation of some people from
pastoralist communities in wildlife crime, such as elephant and rhino
poaching. This often results in a stereotyping of these communities as
innately difficult to control or as hostile to wildlife conservation.
However, as was noted in a presentation by the Kenya Wildlife Service to
the ATT Academy in Kenya in December 2016, **[the participation of
pastoralists in wildlife crime]{.underline}** **[may be explained by
their proximity to wildlife]{.underline}** reserves and conservancies,
which were often actually alienated from pastoralist communities. In the
early companion paper to this one, Pace University and Control **[Arms
researchers found that wildlife crime]{.underline}**, like cattle
raiding, **[is an increasing globalized criminal
enterprise.]{.underline}** Responding to demand far from East Africa,
[**[transnational organized crime]{.underline}**
**[networks]{.underline}** **[are involved in]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[the [poaching]{.mark} and trafficking of
wildlife]{.underline}** around the world. **[[Militarized state
responses]{.mark} to this crisis (]{.underline}**of collapsing
populations of elephants and rhinos) have often **[[failed to meet human
rights standards]{.underline}]{.mark}** and have even been implicated in
poaching.21 A recent RECSA report had similar findings.22 **[[The
ATT]{.underline}]{.mark}** thus **[[offers a]{.mark} useful [framework
for addressin]{.mark}g the impact of transnational organized crime in
pastoralist communities, both from [cattle raiding and wildlife
crime.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

excursion prepared to use force]{.underline}**, if necessary. **[[A
cattle raid]{.mark} therefore [is an act of war]{.mark} between
enemies]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** can **[constitute a
declaration of war between different parties]{.underline}** who had been
at peace. **[[It risks]{.mark} at]{.underline}** least **[[becoming a
battle]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Raiders lift up steel against the
enemy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is a taboo within one\'s society
still maintained. When two friends of mine each picked up a panga (large
knife) to defend themselves in a dispute over bridewealth, they were
called ngimoe (enemies), and a large group was organized to arrest them
(Knighton 2005: 109). [**[Although the dominant motive of a
raid]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} normally **[[to seize
livestock, arms have always been carried on a]{.mark} cattle
[raid]{.mark}]{.underline}**: knives, spears and guns. **[Taking
cattle]{.underline}** then **[is an act of war between
enemies]{.underline}**, otherwise, **[if it is internal to one\'s own
society,]{.underline}** it is a case of theft, punishable by the elders
at their discretion in the most effective way possible. Again **[the
felon may be declared]{.underline}** emoit (**[enemy]{.underline}**),
**[but this time by the elders in session, so that now his life may be
forfeit, for anyone could then kill him with impunity]{.underline}**.

**Escalates to global nuclear war**

**Deutsch 1** (Dr. Jeffery, Founder -- Rabid Tiger Project, Rabid Tiger
Newsletter, Vol. 2, No. 7, 11-18,
http://www.rabidtigers.com/rtn/newsletterv2n9.html)

The Rabid Tiger Project believes that [a [nuclear war is **most likely**
to start in Africa]{.mark}. Civil wars]{.underline} in the Congo (the
country formerly known as Zaire), Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and
domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, as well as
occasional brushfire and other wars (thanks in part to \"national\"
borders that cut across tribal ones) [turn into a really nasty
stew.]{.underline} We\'ve got all too many rabid tigers and potential
rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button rather than risk being
seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown.
Geopolitically speaking, [Africa is open range]{.underline}. Very few
countries in Africa are beholden to any particular power. [South
Africa]{.underline} is a major exception in this respect - not to
mention in that ~~she~~ also [probably already has the Bomb. Thus,
[outside powers can]{.mark} more [easily find client
states]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}there than, say, in Europe where
the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of
the countries (China, India, Japan) are powers unto themselves and
don\'t need any \"help,\" thank you. Thus, [an [African war can attract
outside involvement]{.mark} very quickly]{.underline}. Of course, a
proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But
[[an African]{.mark} nuclear [strike can **ignite a much broader
conflagration**]{.mark}]{.underline}, if the other powers are interested
in a fight. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been
facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc.
[Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go

### Nigeria

#### Small arms contribute to instability in Nigeria.

**[Abiodum 18]{.underline}** (Temitope Francis Abiodum, September 2018,
"Small Arms and Light Weapons Proliferation and Its Threats to
Nigeria\'s Internal Security", ResearchGate,
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331639338_Small_Arms_and_Light_Weapons_Proliferation_and_Its_Threats_to_Nigeria\'s_Internal_Security,
accessed 7-15-2019) wl

However, Wilson (2014) gave the various components of national security
to buttress the meaning and they include; political security, economic
security, energy and natural resources security, homeland security,
cyber security, human security and environmental security. **[[Although
Nigeria‟s problem with SALWs is not new]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[its
increasing availability]{.mark} in the last decade]{.underline}**
**[[has helped]{.mark} stoke a wave of
[insurgencies]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[ethno-religious conflicts,
cross-border banditry, kidnapping, terrorism]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,
human trafficking and drugs, armed robbery and other violent
crimes]{.underline}**. **[Arms build-up]{.underline}** **[has fuelled
violence in]{.underline}** various parts of **[Nigeria]{.underline}** --
especially communal clashes and ethno-religious conflicts. Between 1999
and April 2010, Nigeria recorded at least 187 ethno-religious conflicts,
leading to the death of several thousands of people (Osman, 2010).
**[[These weapons]{.mark} helped]{.underline}** to **[[prolong
conflicts]{.mark}, [induce]{.mark}d huge internal [population
displacement]{.mark}, undermined social peace [and devastate]{.mark}d
the [economic livelihoods]{.mark} of individuals and communities. As a
result]{.underline}** of recurrent violent conflicts, **[Nigeria is
faced with the herculean task of responding to a fluctuating
but]{.underline}** always **[sizeable number of internally displaced
persons]{.underline}** (IDPs) (Ibid).

Between 2000 and 2002, for instance, an estimated 1,713,306 persons were
displaced by ethno-religious conflicts and, by June 2013, some 1.6
million Nigerians are estimated to have been internally displaced. The
January 2010 crisis in Jos, Plateau State displaced over 40,000 persons.
Situations of internal displacement undermine human security at
individual and community levels. IDPs are usually vulnerable to violent
crimes like robbery and rape, and are prone to contracting contagious
diseases, due to poor sanitary conditions at the settlement centres
(Nte, 2011). **[The impact of Nigeria‟s SALWs]{.underline}** **[problem
on human security]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** also **[evident in
financial losses induced by conflicts]{.underline}**. About 10 major
ethnoreligious conflicts between 1999 and 2004 cost the Nigerian
government over 400 million naira (US\$2.86 million).

Besides, **[the amount of money]{.underline}** that
**[governments]{.underline}** **[spend on security during]{.underline}**
such **[crises]{.underline}** and their aftermath **[are
huge.]{.underline}** In **[the aftermath of the Jos crisis
i]{.underline}**n early 2010, **[the federal government assisted the
Bauchi]{.underline}** State **[government]{.underline}** with ₦135
million (**[US\$900 000) to]{.underline}** **[help
resettle]{.underline}** or integrate about 30,000 IDPs from neighbouring
Plateau State seeking refuge in Bauchi State (Christopher, 2011:19).

Other Deadly Security Threats Currently Bedeviling Nigerian State
Include:

Boko Haram

**[Nigeria]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** currently **[bedevilled
with profound threat of terrorism]{.underline}**, especially in the
North-Eastern part of the country. In the last six years, the country
has witnessed the vulnerability of terror, criminality and instability.
**[The disheartening phenomena include]{.underline}**, but not limited
to the devastation and **[annihilations]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** several **[towns]{.underline}**, villages,
churches, mosques, Police Stations, schools and other public
institutions with Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) bombs planted and
small arms and light weapons (SALW) by the Boko Haram insurgents in
Niger, Bornu, Adamawa, Kano, Bauchi, FCT Abuja, Kaduna, Plateau and Yobe
states respectively (Abiodun, 2016:145).

**[The proliferation of these small arms and light
weapons]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** the new emergent trend in
**[armed violence in Nigeria]{.underline}** **[put to question the
efficacy]{.underline}** and total commitment **[of the Nigerian
government]{.underline}** in combating the menace. **[[The alarming rate
of SALW]{.underline}]{.mark}** spread **[[poses a serious
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[challenge to Nigeria‟s]{.mark}
internal [security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, **[[the outbreak of
Islamic extremism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and domestic terrorism **[in
the North-East]{.underline}**, Nigeria**[, [remains evident in the
growing audacity]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
"**[[Boko]{.mark} [Haram]{.mark}"]{.underline}** sect, following the
attacks in the Eagle Square, Abuja during the 50th Independence Day, 1
October, 2010 in which no fewer than 12 people were killed; the Nyanya
Motor Park bombing on April 14, 2014 also claimed more than 75 lives and
injured several dozen others, bombing of the UN Building in the FCT and
abduction of about 216 girls of in Chibok, Borno State the next day
leaving the country in a state of insecurity (Abiodun, 2016:146).

Armed Robbery

**[[Another]{.underline}]{.mark}** security
**[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is **[plaguing]{.underline}** the
country **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[armed banditry]{.underline}**
**[using]{.underline}**]{.mark} all sorts of **[[s]{.mark}mall
[a]{.mark}rms and [l]{.mark}ight [w]{.mark}eapons]{.underline}**. Only
recently, a new trend of robbery which was quite different in outlook
occurred at Ogolonto area of Ikorodu, Lagos State, when a lady
reportedly led the gang to the banks and stayed outside while the
two-hour operation lasted. The leader of the gang was said to have sat
down in front of the bank bragging, and no police officer was able to
confront her. It was disclosed that the gang that carried out the
robbery consisted about 15 youngsters, all in their early 20s.
Incidences of armed robbery have become a daily routine in many parts of
the country. Apart from public institutions such as banks that are their
major targets, major highways across the country are not spared as
commuters are routinely attacked and dispossessed of their valuables.
(The Punch, 18 April, 2016).

**[Militancy]{.underline}**

**[Ethnic militia has been a recurring decimal in Nigeria]{.underline}**
**[and its fledgling democracy]{.underline}**. **[The restoration of
democratic rule in]{.underline}** Nigeria on May 29, 1999 **[signalled
the emergence]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** continued
**[proliferation of vigilante groups]{.underline}**, ethnic and
sectional militias as well as secessionist or separatist groups wielding
all sorts of arms and weapons. Prominent among these are: the Bakassi
Boys, a vigilante outfit set up by Abia and Anambra State governments to
curb criminal activities in 1999; the Egbesu Boys (1998); the Movement
for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) 2000;
Ijaw Militia and Itsekiri Militias (1999), and the Militia arm of
Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) 1992 (Analyst,
2010). A most recent development is the emergence of **[[Niger Delta
militants]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the name „Niger Delta Avengers‟.
The „Niger Delta Avengers‟ (NDA) **[[has continued to launch attacks
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** some **[[major oil
installations]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in the oil rich
region]{.underline}**, **[[using]{.mark} the various
[arms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, IEDs and ammunitions in their possession
(The Vanguard, 13 April, 2016).

#### Nigerian collapse spills over

**[Gardner 6]{.underline}** \[Dan Gardner, "Western world ignoring
demise of Nigeria", The Ottawa Citizen, 3/23/06, lexis\]

[[Imagine]{.mark} a country that is one of [the world\'s largest]{.mark}
[exporters of oil]{.mark}.]{.underline} Imagine a country in which
ethnic and sectarian violence has killed thousands and driven millions
from their homes, a country so fragile that a recent report commissioned
by the CIA concluded there is a good chance it will collapse. Imagine a
country that Osama bin Laden has declared to be \"ripe for liberation.\"
[This country is not in the Middle East]{.underline}. It\'s also not on
the minds of western media or politicians, despite the almost
unimaginable havoc that would be unleashed if the feared collapse comes.
[It is Nigeria]{.underline}. A British invention, [Nigeria
is]{.underline} a country [[made up of]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[250
ethnic groups]{.mark}]{.underline} and countless tribal subdivisions
sharing only a weak national identity. It is also a country of intense
and growing religious passions whose 132 million people are divided
almost equally between Christians and Muslims. Violent earthquakes can
erupt along any of these fault lines. In February, Muslims in the north
murdered 50 Christians. Christians in the south retaliated by murdering
Muslims. Thousands fled in terror. These latest clashes started with
protests against the Danish cartoons, but most have less exotic origins.
People fight for land or God. They fight to control local governments.
They fight to avenge insults. In the Niger Delta, they fight for control
of oil. Dozens die in one clash. Hundreds in another. It\'s low-grade
warfare but the toll steadily climbs. By one estimate, 20,000 Nigerians
have been killed in fighting since 1999, when democracy was restored
after 16 years of military rule. And for every corpse, more than a
hundred people have been driven from their homes. \"The magnitude,
scope, character and dimension of internally displaced persons in
Nigeria is frightening,\" declared a report released last week by
Nigeria\'s National Commission for Refugees. Since 1999, the commission
says, three million people have fled. Their plight represents one of the
gravest humanitarian crises in the world. It is also one of the most
unrecognized. The bloody clashes in Nigeria almost never rate a mention
in the western media and western politicians pay even less attention to
the country than they do to other African hot spots. As a result, very
few people in Canada realize how dangerous the situation has become.
\"While currently Nigeria\'s leaders are locked in a bad marriage that
all dislike but dare not leave,\" states a 2005 report commissioned by
the CIA, an event such as [a coup attempt could spark open warfare and
\"outright collapse.\"]{.underline} AN OIL SHOCK [The consequences would
be immense. \"[If Nigeria were to]{.mark} become a [fail]{.mark}ed
state]{.underline},\" the report concluded, \"[[it]{.mark} could [drag
down]{.mark} a large part of [the]{.mark} West African
[region]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} Millions would flee. [There\'s also the
matter of oil]{.underline}. Even now, world oil prices jump every time a
bullet is fired in the Niger Delta[. If Nigeria were to collapse, [there
could be an oil shock the like of which we haven\'t
seen]{.mark}]{.underline} since the Iranian Revolution. [[And]{.mark}
[since]{.mark} [the]{.mark} long-term [energy strategy of the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [assumes]{.mark} rising [African
oil]{.mark} production, [chaos]{.mark} in the Niger Delta [would]{.mark}
**almost certainly [bring in the Marines]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### That goes nuclear

**[Lancaster 00]{.underline}** (Carol, Associate Professor and Director
of the Master\'s of Science in Foreign Service Program -- Georgetown
University, "Redesigning Foreign Aid", Foreign Affairs, September /
October, Lexis)

THE MOST BASIC CHALLENGE facing the United States today is helping to
preserve peace. The end of the Cold War eliminated a potential threat to
American security, but it did not eliminate conflict. In 1998 alone
there were 27 significant conflicts in the world, 25 of which involved
violence within states. Nine of those [[**intrastate conflicts** were
in]{.underline}]{.mark} sub-Saharan [[Africa, where poor
governance]{.mark} has [aggravated]{.mark} ethnic and social
[tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The ongoing war in the Democratic
Republic of the [Congo has been particularly nightmarish,
[combining]{.mark}]{.underline} intrastate and interstate [conflict
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} another troubling element: [[military
intervention driven by]{.mark} the [commercial motives]{.mark} of
several neighboring states. Such motives could [fuel future
conflicts]{.mark} in]{.underline} other weak states with valuable
resources. Meanwhile, a number of other wars \-- in Colombia, the former
Yugoslavia, Cambodia, [Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and Burundi]{.underline}
\-- have reflected historic enmities or poorly resolved hostilities of
the past. Intrastate conflicts are likely to continue in weakly
integrated, poorly governed states, destroying lives and property,
[[creating large numbers of refugees and]{.mark} displaced persons, and
[threatening regional security]{.mark}]{.underline}. The two interstate
clashes in 1998 \-- between India and Pakistan and Eritrea and Ethiopia
\-- involved disputes over land and other natural resources. Such
contests show no sign of disappearing. Indeed, [[with the spread of
**w**]{.underline}]{.mark}eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction, [[these wars]{.mark} could
[prove **more dangerous than ever**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

### Assasinations

#### Arms sales to Africa are used for political assassinations.

**[Shaw 17]{.underline}** (Mark Shaw, Director of the Global Initiative
against Transnational Organized Cri, September 2017, "AFRICA'S CHANGING
PLACE IN THE GLOBAL CRIMINAL ECONOMY ", enact Publications,
https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017-09-26-enact-continental-report1.pdf,
accessed 7-15-2019) wl

**[The link between arms trafficking and organised crime in Africa
should be viewed on three levels:]{.underline}**

**[1. The]{.underline}** first relates to **[the import of firearms from
foreign sources]{.underline}** where there **[is evidence of criminal
activity.]{.underline}** For example, **[arms may]{.underline}** be
**[imported using false end-user certificates]{.underline}** or they may
be transferred to secondary or tertiary destinations.81 **[Using such
meth]{.underline}**ods, **[[weapons brokers have been blamed for]{.mark}
subverting sanctions and [supplying weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[protagonists]{.underline}** in some of
**[[Africa's bloodiest conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example,
the UN-mandated Somalia and Eritrea Monitoring Group has noted that many
of the weapons bound for Somalia are purchased by people in Yemen and
then smuggled across the Gulf of Aden to Somalia.82

**[2.]{.underline}** **[The second is when arms leak out of state
supplies during conflict]{.underline}**. The **[most
prominent]{.underline}** recent **[case entailed large flows of arms
southwards]{.underline}** into the Sahel after the fall of the Gaddafi
regime in Libya. Similarly, weapons sold on the open market in Somalia
include government supplies.83 In South Africa, in what is now a major
criminal case, **[[thousands of weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[seized]{.underline}** or collected by the state **[[were sold to
criminal gangs]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Western Cape by a senior
police officer responsible for the police armoury.84

**[3.]{.underline}** The third is **[the purchase of weapons by criminal
groups]{.underline}** and networks **[directly from
suppliers]{.underline}** or local sellers. **[Some of these purchases
are]{.underline}** completed **[under the guise of legal
transactions]{.underline}**, **[but the weapons are subsequently used in
criminal activities]{.underline}**. For example, **[[weapons
purchased]{.mark} in this way [have been used]{.mark} in
criminal]{.underline}** **[and [political
assassinations]{.mark}]{.underline}** and in taxi-industry conflicts in
South Africa.85 There is also growing evidence that the Internet is used
as a platform for the sale of weapons: in Libya small arms and light
weapons manufactured in 26 states have been traded on the illicit online
market.86

**[Accessing arms greatly]{.underline}** **[strengthens local actors in
the societies into which they flow]{.underline}**. **[This provides
opportunities outside of armed conflict or war]{.underline}** (a context
that a recent analysis of Chad has neatly termed 'the inter-war' -- a
period outside of formally declared conflict but where violence is
prevalent87), **[where [the presence of arms]{.mark} in]{.underline}**
fragile environments **[[allows violent]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(sometimes political) **[[entrepreneurs to leverage change]{.mark} and
access resources.]{.underline}**

**[In such complex systems]{.underline}** of governance, political,
government, [**[business and criminal networks merge]{.underline}** --
**[making them susceptible]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}**]{.mark}
those with the potential for [**[violence]{.underline}**. **[The market
for assassinations]{.underline}**]{.mark} in these cases **[[blurs the
influence of organised crime and distorts]{.mark} economic, political
and social [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}**.88 In such contexts,
**[violent entrepreneurs]{.underline}** -- groups who might be termed
'mafia' elsewhere -- **[often strengthen their position]{.underline}**
**[by protecting externally sourced illicit flows]{.underline}**. **[The
ability of militias in Libya]{.underline}**, for example**[, to access
weapons enabled]{.underline}** them to enter numerous illegal markets,
displacing groups who had less reliable supplies of arms.89 **[The same
applies to organisedcrime]{.underline}** **[groups]{.underline}**
**[engaged in robbery]{.underline}** and freight hijacking in Southern
Africa: **[those that are better armed have greater potential for
growth]{.underline}**.90

#### Political assassinations cause major war\-\--spillover to other countries, civil wars, and economic shocks

**[Iqbal 08]{.underline}** (Zaryab Iqbal, Department of Political
Science at Pennsylvania State University, 21 and Christopher Zorn, Jun.,
2008, "The Political Consequences of Assassination", Sage Publications,
The Journal of Conflict, Vol. 52, No. 3 (Jun., 2008), pp. 385-400,

Former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli is said to have remarked
that \"assassination has never changed the history of the world.\" Yet
**[our analyses]{.underline}** here **[suggest]{.underline}** that the
**[[assassination]{.mark} of a state\'s leader can]{.underline}**, in
fact, **[[have serious repercus sions for that state\'s internal
political stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In particular, such
**[[assassinations significantly increase the likelihood]{.mark} of
violent manifestations of dissent, such as coups, [revolutions]{.mark},
and civil wars]{.underline}**. Based on these findings, **[the
assassination of a head of state is]{.underline}** clearly **[an
important form of political violence]{.underline}** and one that
warrants systematic study of both its causes and its consequences.

Here, we have presented an analysis of **[the relationship between
assassination and a]{.underline}** range of **[types of political
instability]{.underline}** from political unrest and protest to civil
war. Our findings **[support a neoinstitutional view]{.underline}** of
**[that]{.underline}** relationship: **[assassinations\' adverse
political effects are generally assuaged by the presence of a
standardized means for leadership succession]{.underline}**. That
conclusion is, at one level, unsurprising the key role of such
mechanisms is to ensure that the legitimacy and authority of the state
lives on after the death of the leader.

**[The consequences of the assassination of a head of
state]{.underline}**, however, **[are not limited to expressions of
political dissent]{.underline}**. **[The termination of a political
regime through assassination]{.underline}** could have **[significant
implications for the political institu tions of a state]{.underline}**
and subsequent regimes. For instance, is **[the assassination of a
repressive and autocratic leader]{.underline}** followed by reform of
political institutions and a democratic leadership? To the extent that
**[assassinations]{.underline}** often **[reflect]{.underline}** **[a
desperate need to usher in political change]{.underline}**, it would be
worthwhile to examine the kind of institutional change if any that is
instigated after an assassination. On one hand, the demise of an
autocratic leader may provide an opportunity and the necessary
environment for setting up democratic institutions. Conversely, **[the
political tumult and instability following an assassination may result
in enabling an equally despotic leader from an opposing faction to seize
power.]{.underline}**

Beyond its political consequences, **[the societal shock of an
assassination may]{.underline}** also **[have economic
effects.]{.underline}** [**[Both private and public
enterprises]{.underline}** **[rely on political]{.underline}**]{.mark}
and governmental **[[stability]{.mark} for]{.underline}** their
**[efficient operations]{.underline}**. It is likely that the
**[[assassination of a head of state affects economic]{.mark} and
commercial [policies in ways that disrupt the domestic economy and/or
international trade]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Thus, the relationship
between assassination and aspects of domestic and international
political economy is a valuable direction for future research. Yet
**[another dimension of the effects of assassination may be regional
instability]{.underline}**. **[Since [assassination increases the likeli
hood of political instability and]{.mark} domestic [militarized
conflict]{.mark} in a state]{.underline}**, is it possi ble that
**[[this instability could diffuse to other states]{.mark} in a
region]{.underline}**? As we note above, **[it is not unusual for
[neighboring states]{.mark} to [become involved in civil
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for instance, **[[through troop
contributions or refugee flows]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see, e.g.,
Gleditsch 2007). **[The [death of a state leader may]{.mark}
also]{.underline}** **[[be]{.underline}]{.mark}** viewed by
international rivals as an [**[oppor tune time for
invasion]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[[linking assassination to
international conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In summary, a host of
possible consequences of assassination remain to be explored.

### Somalia

#### Illicit arms sustains Al-Qaeda in Somalia (+Somalian piracy)

**[Masibo 10]{.underline}** (Moses Masibo, Online Associate Faculty at
Ashford University, 4-6-10, "A National Security Strategy for a New
Century", No Publication,
http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nss/nss2000.htm, accessed 7-15-2019)
wl

We must reiterate that **[arms traffickers hardly
encounter]{.underline}** **[security agents while
transacting]{.underline}** the **[business]{.underline}**. The Kenyan
police's inaction or merely looking the other side as arms traffickers
operate with impunity is one factor that has led to arms influx in
Kenya. Godwin concludes that:

**[Gedo area of Somalia is a key source of ammunition while weapons are
regularly picked at Manyatt Burji-Moyale in Ethiopia. In Garissa,
weapons from Somalia go through Diff, Liboi and daadab]{.underline}**
from where they find their way into Ijara, Tana river, Ukambani, and
Nairobi. These guns eventually end up in Eastleigh and Kariobangi
estates in Nairobi" .

Interestingly, **[these weapons are either carried by children and women
or transported by donkeys]{.underline}**, ox-carts or Lorries/trucks to
various towns in Kenya.

**[In response to the]{.underline}** influx of
**[weapons]{.underline}**, the **[countries within the Great Lakes
region]{.underline}** **[and the horn of Africa]{.underline}**, in
general **[adopted a regional approach]{.underline}** in order **[to
curb the supply and misuse of illicit arms.]{.underline}** This includes
improving the operational capacity of law enforcement agencies,
harmonizing legislation and collection, destruction and disposal of
SALW. However, **[despite the comprehensive nature of the Nairobi
Protocol]{.underline}** for the prevention, **[control and reduction of
small arms and light weapons (SALW)]{.underline}** in the Great Lakes
region and horn of Africa, **[Dominique Dye observed]{.underline}** that
"**[while cooperation at the regional level has been
noteworthy]{.underline}**, **[attempts to implement the provisions of
the protocol]{.underline}** at the national level **[have]{.underline}**
**[met]{.underline}** with a number of **[obstacles]{.underline}**" .
There is no doubt **[countries have been lacking financial
resources]{.underline}**, **[have had limited technical
experts]{.underline}** and generally lacked political will, **[factors
that play against the realization]{.underline}** of any good deals that
may help in getting rid of the illicit weapons from the region.

**[Even [though Kenya has not encountered large scale of attacks from
trouble makers]{.mark} using these weapons, [the risk and danger they
pose to the national security is disquieting]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
There are various instances, however, that have been reported over the
years to have occurred as a result of these weapons. **[The weapons are
mainly used in acts of banditry]{.underline}**, **[cattle rustling and
armed highway attacks]{.underline}**. For instance, it was estimated
that cattle raids in the 1990s resulted to more than 1200 deaths and
about 300,000 livestock theft (Laibuta, 2005).

[**[The situation in Ethiopia is equally tenuous in relation to arms
trafficking]{.underline}** **[as a result of the political instability
in Somalia]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[The relationship of Somalia and
Ethiopia has grown worse by day as compared to Kenya]{.underline}**. The
two countries engaged each other in a bloody war of 1977-1978 which made
shifta war that Somalia engaged with Kenya look like a small family
feud. After the Ogaden war (as it was known), communities along the
Ethiopia-Somalia border accelerated the organized cattle raids. There
was also an increase in attacks within Ethiopian territory by armed
groups opposed to the government, with support from Somalia. The attack
was in the form of banditry activities using small arms such as the
ubiquitous AK 47 and grenades.

**[Djibouti]{.underline}** **[too]{.underline}** **[has]{.underline}**
had **[its share of insecurity as a result of arms
trafficking]{.underline}**. However, the situation here is different
from that of Ethiopia and Kenya. Unlike the two, Djibouti is dominated
by the two interlocking clans, Afar and Issa of the larger Somalis in
Somalia and Ethiopia. Whatever happens to the Afars and Issas of
Ethiopia or Somalia determines the relationship of the two in Djibouti.

However, **[[the proliferation]{.mark} and sale [of small arms creates
an environment where major terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and Al
Shabaab find a safe haven and breeding ground]{.mark} of their
networks]{.underline}**. In the next section I analyze the effects of
terrorism in the horn and East Africa as a result of instability in
Somalia.

SOMALIA AS A SAFE HAVEN FOR AL QAEDA AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS

**[Al Qaeda]{.underline}** and other terrorist groups **[are the most
wanted perpetrators]{.underline}** of the post-9/11 attack. Former
President of the US George W. Bush and his administration declared war
on terror after the September 11, 2001 attack and employed massive
resources in finding and crushing the groups and their related links.
**[The US state department has documented several groups on the list of
wanted terrorists.]{.underline}**

**[In Somalia alone]{.underline}** **[there are]{.underline}** at least
**[half a dozen groups]{.underline}** that **[the State department
believes have links with Al Qaeda]{.underline}** or other related
elements. Since the fall of Siad Barre, about two decades ago it is
unbelievable that Somalia remains a training ground for terrorist
organizations. The US and most of the Western world believed that the
fall of Siad Barre had given rise to instability in Somalia. They argued
that the country was too unstable and ungoverned and therefore was not
conducive environment for militants to train and learn the guerrilla
tactics. However, the thought was immediately jettisoned after Ethiopia
invaded and removed the Islamist government in Mogadishu.

Following Ethiopia's invasion, several commentators such as Scott
Baudauf have considered it as "foreign occupier" of Somalia. Baudauf
argued that "Islamist forces were able to pull back, regroup, and
recruit thousands of new fighters, at home and abroad, to repel a
foreign and Christian occupation of their country" . It is evident the
invasion made matters worse for the already unstable country.

It is important to note, however, that in 2001, the administration in
Washington started getting concerned about the relationship of Somalia
and Al Qaeda following 9/11 attack. **[Some officials in the
administration believed]{.underline}** that **[Somalia supports
terrorism and that Al Qaeda was using Somalia as a base of operation to
attack U.S. targets]{.underline}**. **[The administration
became]{.underline}** increasingly **[concerned]{.underline}** that
**[Al Qaeda members]{.underline}** may **[flee from Afghanistan to
Somalia]{.underline}** (Dagne, 2002). Colin Powel, for instance, the
then secretary of state asserted "some Bin Laden followers are holed up
in Somalia, taking advantage of the absence of a functioning government"
. The former assistant secretary of state for Africa, Walter Kansteiner,
in response to informations that Al Qaeda was finding safe haven in
Somalia, retorted that "the United States will ensure that any
activities in Somalia would not affect its neighboring countries" .
Certainly, the unstable condition in the country had come to create a
fertile ground for terrorist groups

**[Other terrorist groups appear]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}**
have **[complicate]{.underline}**d **[the equation in
Somalia]{.underline}**. Al Ittihad (Islamic Union, IU) was probably the
first group in Somalia that was added to the terrorist list by the US
State department. The US administration ordered its assets to be frozen
so as to cripple its activities in the region. In retrospect, the group
was founded in the late 1980s but became active in mid 1990s through
early 2000s. Its objective was to establish an Islamic state in Somalia.
Other than the social activities and religious objectives the group
fronts in Somalia, the group engaged in military activities in support
of people of Somali origin in Ethiopia.

Al Ittihad operated in cahoots with anti-Ethiopian groups in the Ogaden
region carrying out attacks against Ethiopian government. As Theodros
Dagne has argued, "Ethiopian officials have consistently accused Al
Ittihad of having links with Middle Eastern terrorist organizations and
have portrayed Al Ittihad as a threat to regional peace and stability" .
But Al Ittihad was not the only group operating in the region. Beginning
in the year 2000, other groups of similar ideological orientation
started to form in Somalia. For instance by 2006, the Union of Islamic
Courts (UIC) emerged as a strong militant group which fought and
controlled Mogadishu for about six months. It had to take the well
equipped Ethiopian military with the help of the United States to defeat
them and install back the Transitional Federal Government (TFG).
Ethiopia's officials argued that they had to intervene in Somalia
because of its national and regional peace and stability. Other players
in the region, however contested Ethiopia's military aggression and in
particular in support of some warlords groups. They feared that by doing
so, Ethiopia increased regional tension and instability.

**[Another group that the state department believes has links with Al
Qaeda is Al Shabaab]{.underline}**. **[This group started]{.underline}**
**[capturing the international attention during]{.underline}** and after
**[Ethiopia's invasion]{.underline}** and subsequent withdrawal from
Somalia. **[It is the group that continues to control most parts of
southern Somalia to date]{.underline}**. When Ethiopian troops left
Somalia in the early January 2009, Al **[Shabaab had a substantial area
of control including Baidoa, Kismayo and most parts of the
south.]{.underline}** The group received numerous supports from within
and outside Somalia.

Writing on the source of inspiration and financial support of Al
Shabaab, Daveed Garstein-Ross, for instance, argued that
"battle-hardened extremists from safe havens along the
Pakistan-Afghanistan border were entering East Africa" . These reports
caused a lot of concern in the West and made United States worry that
extremists may pass on the sophisticated training and techniques to
Somalia insurgents and destabilize the entire region. Al Shabaab imposes
a strict version of Sharia law to the areas they capture and normally
form government that oversees that Sharia is followed. In a nutshell, Al
Shabaab is a no nonsense group that executes its strict rule
unsparingly.

Perhaps the most telling instructive catastrophe of all in East Africa
was the bombing of the US embassy in Kenya and Tanzania. Again, Theodros
writes that "On 7 August 1998, mid-morning explosions killed 213 people
at the US embassy in Kenya, 12 of whom were U.S. citizens, and 11 people
at the US embassy in Tanzania" . The mastermind of the bombing as many
reports indicated was a Kenyan born with links to Al Qaeda. Saleh Ali
Saleh Nabhan is believed was born in Mombasa, Kenya and received
training with the group. He remained on the US wanted list since 1996
until he was killed sometime early this year while hiding in Somalia.
Nabhan was also thought to be the strategist in a truck bomb attack on
an Israel owned hotel in Mombasa in 2002. At the time of his death on
September 2009, Nabhan was Al Shabaab's chief military strategist. It is
reported that he formally and officially reached out to Al Qaeda for
cooperation.

**[All [these militant activities are the effects of instability]{.mark}
in Somalia]{.underline}** which is becoming dire every day. **[The
situation calls for an urgent and strategic international solution about
the state of affairs in Somalia.]{.underline}** **[Otherwise, [Somalia
is increasing harboring terrorist elements]{.mark} [that may unleash the
worst ever attack to the region and]{.mark} possibly]{.underline}**
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** other parts of **[[the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Already piracy is becoming a nightmare
and the international community is proving incapable in addressing the
piracy problem.]{.underline}**

PIRACY IN THE GULF OF ADEN AND OFF THE SOMALIA SEA

**[Piracy in the Gulf of Aden]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[an
offshoot of instability in Somalia]{.underline}** following the fall of
Siad Barre. Immediately **[after the fall of Barre]{.underline}**
**[regime]{.underline}** the coastal region of Somalia was managed by
UNOSOM1 &2 until the United States and United Nations pulled out of
Somalia. During Siad Barre' time as president he had a maritime force
that protected the enormous fisheries in Somalia waters. The force
restricted regional inclination to piracy and maritime crime. However,
this was let lose after the collapse of Barre's regime.

It is therefore fitting to argue that **[[piracy]{.mark} in the Gulf of
Aden]{.underline}** **[and off the coast of Somalia [is a menace and a
threat not just to the horn]{.mark} and East Africa, [but to the
international community too]{.mark}. Piracy]{.underline}**, as James and
Wilson has observed, "**[is an illegal act of violence committed for
private ends]{.underline}** by the crew or passengers of a ship against
another ship outside of a state's territorial waters" . Otherwise,
**[inside territorial waters such crimes are considered armed robbery at
sea.]{.underline}**

Many scholars believe that **[proximity of politically unstable
nations]{.underline}** and territories **[are both cause of armed
robbery or maritime piracy]{.underline}** in such regions. Weir Gary,
for instance, concluded that "Somalia's internal unrest, its lack of
government control, and the authority of local clan warlords have
created a favorable climate for maritime crime, one that often gives
thieves and pirates permission to act freely" . A lot has been written
and published about the poverty nature, lack of infrastructure, and less
opportunities in Somalia and therefore combined with lack of government
has led to the spiraling of piracy in the horn of Africa. As James and
Wilson have asserted, "The threat of maritime piracy exists in the horn
of Africa as a result of the desperate situation in Somalia and the
devastated political economy along the coastal line" . **[Piracy
has]{.underline}** also **[been used for money laundering business in
Somalia]{.underline}** and adjacent countries like Kenya and Ethiopia,
just to mention a few.

Inasmuch as the paper does not wish to discount such observations made
by people like James Kraska and group, it is our profound understanding
that the Western media has not fully explained the piracy phenomenon in
the horn of Africa. The Western media, for instance, has avoided
reporting on the dumping of toxic substances on the coastal region of
Somalia. It was not until the Asian Tsunami of 2005 that the sea waters
washed ashore tons of radioactive waste and toxic chemicals awakening
the world to this great scandal. Let us note that many Somalis fell ill
and developed medical complications like mouth bleeds, unusual skin
disorders, and breathing difficulties, yet, the media kept mum over the
issue (Whitney, 2008).

There were also the fishing rights and competition among the numerous
foreign and local fishermen. There is no doubt that **[many of the
coastal village Somalis]{.underline}**, **[offshore fishing was
central]{.underline}** and **[significant to their
livelihood]{.underline}**. They virtually depended on this industry for
their survival. Then after the collapse of the government, uncontrolled
foreign exploitation certainly emerged. The confrontation over the
offshore was not just about remaining in the business, but Somalis had
to diversify their methods of survival and as a result piracy has become
a lucrative business off the shore of Somalia.

**[[The consequence of]{.mark} increased [piracy]{.mark} in the region
[is widespread]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The countries in the region
are feeling the heat]{.mark} [and the world is
puzzled]{.mark}]{.underline}** and almost confused **[on how to handle
the]{.underline}** ever increasing **[illegal activity]{.underline}**.
Weir Gary observed that "by 2002 the international maritime Bureau (IMB)
reported that the number of attacks had jumped from 335 in 2001 to 370
in 2002 and had increased its rating for the risk of attack" . Ideally,
piracy repression may need international cooperation and coordination
because the activities are done under no state's jurisdiction. Such
understanding and in view of countering piracy, led to the formation of
customary international law, the 1958 convention on the high seas, and
the 1982 United Nations convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS). The
latter convention among other legislations accorded rights of
jurisdiction to states of about 12 nautical miles in the territorial
sea. The United Nations Security Council in response to the piracy in
the horn of Africa passed and adopted resolution 1816 in order to obtain
greater cooperation against Somali piracy. This is because pirates were
eluding capture by retreating into Somalia's 12 nautical mile
territorial seas. The resolution authorized a period of six months entry
into Somalia's waters. The loophole of this resolution is that it does
not compel states to prosecute pirates. In fact, France and Denmark have
on several occasions released captured pirates due to lack of evidence
and other logistical technicalities.

The difficulties have been alleviated to some degree by the disposition
principle where efforts of investigation, trial, and punishment were
allocated to some specific state(s). For instance, United States and
United Kingdom entered into the prosecution agreements with Kenya. As a
result, **[Kenya has arrested large numbers of pirates who have been
arraigned in its courts]{.underline}** for trial. **[This does not only
strain Kenya's resources but does not also project Kenya in a good
way]{.underline}** among the Somali communities in Kenya and the militia
groups that benefit from the illicit business. **[By arraigning pirates
in Kenyan courts]{.underline}**, **[Kenya risks retaliation from these
groups given the tenuous relationship]{.underline}** as explained in
other sections in this paper. As a matter of fact **[Al Shabaab has
threatened many times to attack Kenyan targets]{.underline}** in the
region including Nairobi.

SOMALI REFUGEES TRICKLE TO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES

A refugee, by definition, is an individual fleeing persecution and
violence who has lost the protection of his State and thus needs
protection from another entity. The UNHCR appeals to states to ensure
that refugees are accorded safe and secure environment. In spirit of
this mandate, countries that receive refugees set up camps through which
they provide protection and assistance.

Since 1991, **[Somali refugees have been flocking in droves
to]{.underline}** the North Eastern part of **[Kenya]{.underline}** and
other places within the country. **[The number of Somali refugees
is]{.underline}** quite **[disturbing]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** more so **[presents]{.underline}** a lot of
**[difficulties to the host countries]{.underline}** in making sure that
they are safe and well catered for. Media reports indicated that "About
47,000 people have fled the city during the fighting and more have been
queuing up to leave, by minibus, donkey or on foot. And all this comes
only three months after the Ethiopian-backed government had supposedly
claimed control of the city" . As such it has become a big problem for
Kenya to handle and give them sufficient resources for use.

As noted in other parts of this paper, some **[illegal elements
have]{.underline}** also **[infiltrated through the guise of being
refugees]{.underline}** and later bring havoc to national security in
the region. **[Some]{.underline}** of the **[refugees have found way to
other towns and places in the country causing a breach of the
asylum]{.underline}** **[protocol]{.underline}**. Women and children who
come in genuinely as refugees have been used by militia groups to
smuggle in the country illicit weapons and other illegal items. In
essence, the refugee issue in Kenya poses a dilemma to the Kenyan
government as to either accommodate them or simply deny them entry.

The lives in the camps are neither good nor desirable. Little can be
done about it especially if left only to Kenya. There are reported
rampant incidences of rapes and other forms of gender-based violence,
armed attacks and robbery in the camps, and confrontations with local
communities. While the UNHCR expects Kenya to ensure safety of refugees,
**[the international community needs to assist Kenya in giving the
Somali refugees in their camps a human face by providing security and
other human needs.]{.underline}**

SOMALIA AS A FACTOR IN FUELLING TENSIONS AND CONFLICTS BETWEEN ETHIOPIA
AND ERITREA

**[The [conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea is]{.mark}
troubling]{.underline}** as it is also causing problems for the Horn of
Africa. **[One can describe this as [a live bomb]{.mark} that the world
has not paid due attention to [and]{.mark} yet [the horn of Africa is
uncomfortably sitting on]{.mark} it]{.underline}**. **[This conflict is
mind boggling]{.underline}** **[and is]{.underline}** possibly **[one
that needs greater attention by the world community]{.underline}**.
Historically, Ethiopia and Eritrea have the complex relationship of
existence and for a long time the relationship has become extremely
tenuous.

Ethiopia is one of the two countries in Africa that were never colonized
by European powers at the close of the nineteenth century. Other than
having been occupied by the Italians and later by the British, Eritrea
engaged Ethiopia in one of the longest civil wars in the history of
Africa (1961-1991). The animosity of the two did not go away even after
Eritrea became independent in 1993. The dispute over the border
remained, with the two countries contesting ownership. The dispute led
to another bloody war between 1998 and 2000. The deal was brokered by
the help of the United Nations. The two agreed to abide by the terms and
deliberations the UN would come up with. Despite the agreement, Ethiopia
did not own it up when a UN backed boundary commission resolved to award
the disputing areas including the town of Badme to Eritrea. Ethiopia did
not abide by the ruling and still claim ownership of the town and indeed
its military presence in the area is still building.

The issue mentioned above notwithstanding, there was some relative peace
since 2000 when the deal was struck. However, since 2006, the tension
started building following Ethiopia's invasion of Somalia. Eritrea was
accused in particular by the United Nations Security Council of
financing, training, and supporting Somalia militia groups to
destabilize Ethiopia. Indeed, most media outlets reported that Eritrea
probably sees the mayhem in Somalia as a chance to make life hard as
possible for its Ethiopian neighbor and a longtime mortal enemy. The
administration of Asmara, Eritrea put it candidly that they opposed any
foreign involvement in Somalia. This was when Ethiopia had invaded
Somalia.

Part of the reason why peace was relatively sustained after the deal was
struck in 2000 was because the United Nations buffed the border with
peacekeepers especially at the disputed town of Badme. The tension was
heightened when Eritrea banned the United Nation's helicopter from
flying in key parts of its air space and in response Ban Ki Moon hinted
on pulling out the peacekeepers. Some scholars have argued that the
United Nations' peacekeepers were key in maintaining peace and stability
and the same will not be guaranteed if the troops would leave.

Part of the reason Asmara banned the United Nations from its air space
was because of too many fingers pointed at Eritrea for its role in
Somalia. While others argue that Ethiopia's invasion of Somalia was to
fledge its muscles and send a message to Asmara that they are still the
kingpin of the region. Assuming that this was Ethiopia's objective, then
they did not achieve it because they were humiliated and finally
withdrew leaving behind a fragmented and fierce Somalia than they found
it. Ethiopia was basically drained financially and militarily even
though they received a lot of support from the United States.
**[[This]{.mark} in a way [has emboldened Eritrea]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[and may be tempted to]{.mark} either escalate the border dispute
or]{.underline}** even **[[attack given that Ethiopia is]{.mark}
increasingly [becoming internally unstable.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

CONCLUSION

The position of this paper regarding **[the instability in
Somalia]{.underline}** and its consequences to the region **[must be
addressed]{.underline}** with sobriety by the Obama administration. The
previous US administrations have been keenly concerned mainly with its
interests in the region than solving the underlining problems of
Somalia. Until and unless the central issues of poverty, unemployment,
and governance are wholesomely addressed the problems will persist and
the region will be polarized putting the entire world community to
jeopardy.

It is also imperative for the people of Somalia to realize that it is
their country that they are destroying. The beautiful Somali heritage
and traditional values that spans for generations are being destroyed
and thus denying future generations from partaking. They should
therefore avoid factional divisions and instead impress the spirit of
nationhood and build their country through proper leadership and
governance.

The African Union is a big led down to the Somali people in particular
and to Africa in general. AU has been bogged down by regional ideologies
and thus failed to remain above water in providing quality leadership
and lasting peace and governance in Somalia. The African body is
incapacitated to marshal enough troops from its member states to act as
peacekeepers in Somalia. So far it is only Uganda and Burundi that
managed to sent peacekeepers even though with pressure from donor
countries. AU should take a lead and at least for once show the rest of
the world that can be trusted in salvaging Africa from its perennial
problems.

Lastly, **[Piracy]{.underline}** in particular **[is not just affecting
the Horn and East Africa,]{.underline}** **[but the international
community]{.underline}** as well. The world must therefore join
concerted efforts to find a lasting solution to Somalia. As the paper
anticipates, [**[instability in Somalia may become a world
problem]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} thus **[[a world
solution to end instability]{.mark} and form a functioning government in
Somalia [must be found.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**Terror escalates globally.**

In The Congo? Why The World Should Care,
<http://www.the-american-interest.com/2013/12/15/peace-in-the-congo-why-the-world-should-care/>

[The Congo war should be a reminder]{.underline} to us all that [the
[foundations of our world are **dynamite**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
that [the [potential for **new conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} on [the
[scale of the]{.mark} **horrific [wars of the 20th century]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} very much **[[with us]{.mark}
today.]{.underline}** The second lesson from this conflict stems from
the realization of how much patience and commitment from the
international community (which in this case included the Atlantic
democracies and a coalition of African states working as individual
countries and through various international institutions) it has taken
to get this far towards peace. Particularly at a time when many
Americans want the US to turn inwards, there are people who make the
argument that it is really none of America's business to invest time and
energy in the often thankless task of solving these conflicts. That
might be an ugly but defensible position if we didn't live in such a
tinderbox world. Someone could rationally say, yes, it's terrible that a
million plus people are being killed overseas in a horrific conflict,
but the war is really very far away and America has urgent needs at home
and we should husband the resources we have available for foreign policy
on things that have more power to affect us directly. The problem is
that **[[these wars spread]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [They]{.underline}
may [start in places]{.underline} that [we don't care]{.underline} much
[about]{.underline} (most Americans didn't give a rat's patootie about
whether Germany controlled the Sudetenland in 1938 or Danzig in 1939)
[but they tend to **spread to places**]{.underline} [that we do care
**very much about**]{.underline}. This can be because a revisionist
great power like Germany in 1938-39 needs to overturn the balance of
power in Europe to achieve its goals, or it can be because
[[instability]{.mark} in a **very remote place**]{.underline} [[triggers
problems in places]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we **care
about**]{.underline}]{.mark} very much. Out of Afghanistan in 2001 came
both 9/11 and the waves of insurgency and instability that threaten to
rip nuclear-armed Pakistan apart or trigger wider conflict with India.
Out of the mess in Syria a witches' brew of terrorism and religious
conflict looks set to complicate the security of our allies in Europe
and the Middle East and even the security of the oil supply on which the
world economy so profoundly depends. [[Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[the [potential for upheaval]{.mark} there]{.underline},
[[is]{.underline} **[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[more
[importance]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to American security than many
people may **understand**.]{.underline} [The [line
between]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Africa and the Mid]{.mark}dle [East
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** a **[[soft]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. [The
[weak states that straddle]{.mark} the **[southern]{.mark}

**[Q]{.mark}**aeda]{.underline} **[[type groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to form and attract local support. There are [networks of
funding]{.underline} [and religious]{.underline} contact that [give
groups in these countries]{.underline} potential **[access to
funds]{.underline}**, **[fighters]{.underline}**,
**[training]{.underline}** and **[weapons]{.underline}** from the Middle
East. [[A war]{.mark} in the eastern Congo [might]{.mark} not directly
trigger these other conflict]{.underline}s, [but it helps to **[create
the swirling underworld]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.underline} **[arms
trading]{.underline}**, **[money transfers]{.underline}**, **[illegal
commerce]{.underline}**]{.mark} and the rise of a generation of young
men who become experienced fighters---and know no other way to make a
living. It destabilizes the environment for neighboring states (like
Uganda and Kenya) that play much more direct role in potential crises of
greater concern to us. This is why the Clinton, Bush and Obama
administrations (representing three very different kinds of American
politics) have all been engaged in efforts like the peace keeping effort
in the Congo. It is why, despite our budget problems at home and despite
our often justifiable impatience with the complexities of dealing with
international coalitions and the inadequacies of international
institutions, we need to continue the slow and painstaking work that
makes agreements like this one possible. [[The world]{.underline} [we
live in is]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[explosive]{.underline}]{.mark}**
one. There are **[all kinds of things that can go horribly
wrong]{.underline}**, and what happens in one corner of the world
doesn't necessarily stay there. Reducing the danger requires an active,
global American foreign policy whether we like it or not. The potential
for new communal and religious wars that kill millions of people and
endanger American security and world peace is very real. The world seems
safer than the world of the 1930s and 1940s in part because the United
States and many of our friends and allies are working quietly around the
world to contain outbreaks of violence, address the [issues]{.underline}
that [exacerbate hatred and distrust]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in
the last analysis are willing to provide the security guarantees and
[deterrents that prevent mass mayhem.]{.underline}

#### Somalia piracy wrecks global trade

La\'Nita M.** Johnson 14**, Graduate Program Coordinator, International
Training and Education Program at American University, "The Consequences
of Somali Piracy on International Trade"
1/1/14, <https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&context=globaltides>

The **maritime piracy attacks that transpire off the Horn of Africa are
severely disrupting international trade**[. The Far East-Europe route
is one of the world's most active transcontinental maritime
routes, as it receives nearly 20 percent of all global trading
activities and more than 80 percent of trade moves through the Gulf of
Aden.]{.underline} More specifically, more than 20,000 ships carrying
most of the world's affordable clothing, crude oil, and dry commodities
pass through this route annually.22 However, on this route, [there is an
important barrier by the Puntland area in northeast Somalia. As
self-ruling clans and warlords govern that unstable region, the adjacent
Gulf of Aden harbors copious amounts of Somali
pirates.]{.underline} Their main goals are to hijack ships and seize the
transported goods, holding them until companies pay the ransom in order
to retrieve their cargo and crewmembers. Consequently, [this
route adequately reflectsthe significant impacts of maritime piracy on
global shipping and world development.]{.underline}23

 

The [financial implications ]{.underline}of maritime piracy [are
widespread.]{.underline} With a lack of central government, Somali
pirates exploit their surrounding waters, leaving the cargo frequently
transported between Europe and Asia endangered. One major implication is
that the [attacks have forced major shipping companies to adjust their
routes from the Far East to Europe. For example, many companies are
altering their courses from the Gulf of Aden to the Cape of Good Hope or
the Suez Canal in order to decrease the likelihood of pirate attacks.
Such changes add significant additional costs. Attacks have created
extra costs for fuel and higher insurance premiums, which ultimately
create an additional burden on consumers in the form of higher prices
for their goods.24 It is estimated that if one-third of the Far-East
European cargo routes were diverted via the Cape of Good Hope, it would
trigger \$7.5 billion extra in expenses worldwide.25]{.underline}

 

 The timeliness of shipments and [delayed delivery]{.underline} of
transported cargo is another consequence [that stems from pirate
attacks]{.underline} and the necessity of rerouting vessels.
Unfortunately, the uncertainty of receiving scheduled cargo creates
often [deters companies, thus significantly decreases trade
opportunities.]{.underline} While it is difficult to study the effects
of insecurity, many studies have been done that demonstrate that more
transparency about the measures being used to combat piracy will result
in higher volumes of trade. Ultimately, **piracy can significantly
affect the gross domestic product of countries whose trade it
disrupts.26**

 

Through data analysis and empirical application, it was discovered
that [the number of hijackings is the most relevant variable to the
economic effects of piracy. Studies show that each increase in the
number of attacks indefinitely hinders the amount of exports of a
country. More specifically, these studies found that the effect of an
additional hijacked vessel can decrease a country's exports by about 1.1
percent. The study found that trade losses due to piracy attacks between
Europe and Asia total \$24.5 billion in just 2008 alone]{.underline}.27

 

In an additional study done by the same authors, the percentage of
piracy acts by Somali pirates is compared to incidents involving
Malaccan pirates (competitors of Somali pirates that plague the Strait
of Malacca), specifically on the Europe-East Asia trade route. From 1999
to 2008, there was a clear increase in the amount of Somali hijackings,
juxtaposed to a sharp decline in Malaccan pirate attacks. [Losses in
trade caused by Somali pirates multiplied by six from 1999 to
2008]{.underline}, while the losses caused by Malaccan pirates were
reduced by one-quarter.28

 

Since 2009, major economic powerhouses have begun deploying naval forces
along the Gulf of Aden in order to protect shipments transported on the
Far East-Europe route. Data demonstrates that the absence of government
intervention is a large factor in the rise of piracy attacks. From 2007
to 2008, piracy incidents rose by seven times, which undeniably could
have been mitigated with better administration involvement. If the
governments had not interfered, total traffic volumes would have reduced
by 30.25 percent, solidifying the theory that maritime piracy in Somalia
is truly affecting global shipping companies' regular activity. While
the affected costs vary, the overall economic welfare loss is
substantially superior, as it entails the losses due to reduction in
traffic volumes and efficiency loss due to using an alternative
route.[Considering that 80 percent of current international trade is
transported by sea, a reduction in these trips can bring shocking
consequences to the global economy]{.underline}.29

 

Overall, the empirical analysis demonstrated an expected annual loss of
\$30 billion on the various countries that utilize the Gulf of Aden
shipping route. Thus, it is imperative for governments and international
organizations to take up effective measures against modern maritime
piracy, **as the economic stakes are extremely pertinent to the health
of the global economy.30**

### Democracy -- Transparency

### Climate Change

#### The ATT is an important first step to tackling wider Climate Change reforms

**[Sio 16]{.underline}** (Su'a William Sio, MP, Convenor of PGA Peace &
Democracy Programme, November 2016, "Statement on Arms Trade Treaty
(ATT) and Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) by Hon. Su'a William Sio

**[[There are many threats in the world. Climate change is
one]{.underline}]{.mark}** and we\'ve debated this topic earlier.
**[We\'ve]{.underline}** also **[debated the threats to our Pacific
resources]{.underline}**, **[especially]{.underline}** our **[fisheries
and minerals.]{.underline}** But **[there are other threats that exist
in the world such as biological weapons and the trading of conventional
weapons]{.underline}**. We in **[the Pacific must take an interest in
these instruments]{.underline}** and not think that is something that
only happens in other parts of the world. We must be interested, and
while our focus is local, we must also be interested in what is
happening globally.

**[There are many international organizations that individual
parliaments]{.underline}** or individual MPs can join and participate in
to gain a better understanding of what is happening in the world. In our
Parliament, we are members of IPU and the CPA and many others. We also
have a group of NZ MPs that are members of Parliamentarians for Global
Action. Some of you are also members of PGA. **[PGA is a global
organization of individual MPs that has a strong focus on promoting
International Peace and Security]{.underline}**. **[We do so by
encouraging Parliamentarians to ratify the]{.underline}**
**[A]{.underline}**rms **[T]{.underline}**rade **[T]{.underline}**reaty
and the Biological Weapons Convention.

[**[The]{.underline}** **[A]{.underline}**]{.mark}rms
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty
**[[is about regulating the]{.mark} sale and [trade of]{.mark}
conventional [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[It is about ensuring
weapons don\'t end up in the wrong hands]{.underline}**]{.mark}. It is
about keeping peace and security in this world.

PGA held a workshop in Tonga last year and brought a number of Speakers
and MPs to discuss the ratification and implementation of the Arms Trade
Treaty. Today I want to encourage strongly that Tonga, Fiji, Kiribati,
Niue, Vanuatu, and Solomon Islands ratify ATT at the soonest
opportunity.

**[[We must take this stance]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order **[[to show
the rest of the world that we are committed to peace, security and the
rule of law]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[If we]{.underline}]{.mark}** are
to **[[expect]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the rest of [the world
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** sign up and **[[ratify Climate
Change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then **[[we must]{.underline}]{.mark}**
also **[do our part and [ratify the ATT.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Similarly the Biological Weapons Convention is about prohibiting the
development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. I
encourage Samoa, Tuvalu, Kiribati and Niue to ratify the Biological
Weapons Convention urgently. I\'m aware that Samoa\'s Foreign Affairs
officials are advancing this work and MPs should support it.

Again we must do our part and send a very strong message that we in the
Pacific are committed to peace, security and law & order for our region
and for all people\'s throughout the world. If we expect the world to
come to our aid on climate change, we must also be prepared to do our
part and support the ATT and BWC for the sake of our world.

I would be happy to discuss how each of you can participate in this
important work**[. It\'s important to play our part as we expect the
rest of the world to do their part in fighting the threat of climate
change.]{.underline}**

### Sustainable Development Goals

#### Enforcing the ATT directly enforces SDGs\-\--key to any problem you can think of [(too broad)]{.mark}

**[The 2030 agenda and the sustainable development goals (SDG), a
collection Of 17 interlinked broad goals, aim to deliver a transformed
world over the Next 13 years]{.underline}**. The **[SDGs focus on ending
poverty and hunger, providing clean Water and sanitation for all,

intended to build on the successes achieved in pursuing the Millennium
development goals (mdg) up to 2015.

However, **[discussion of arms control issues in the SDGs]{.underline}**
**[has been limited]{.underline}**, in general, to Goal 16.4 on reducing
illicit arms in circulation.

**[There is little or no consideration]{.underline}** in UN circles of
the contribution that **[the]{.underline}** **[A]{.underline}**rms
**[T]{.underline}**rade **[T]{.underline}**reaty **[can make to a broad
range of SDGs]{.underline}**. **[[Robust implementation of the ATT

achievement of]{.mark}]{.underline}** many of **[[its 17
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[There is a need to broaden the
discussion]{.underline}** and increase awareness **[of the full range of
SDGs]{.underline}**, **[[the delivery]{.mark} of which]{.underline}**
**[[can be substantially assisted through conflict]{.mark} and armed
violence reduction]{.underline}**, **[[by]{.mark} means
of]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** proper **[[control of

some of these additional synergies, and considers how faithful
implementation of the ATT will positively impact on the achievement of a
number of SDGs -- including but not limited to Goal 5 on Gender
Equality, Goal 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Goal 17 on
Partnerships. All of these will have a positive effect on the
achievement of Goal 1 on Poverty and Goal 2 on Reducing Hunger.

Both **[the ATT and]{.underline}** the **[SDGs]{.underline}** **[aim to
make positive contributions to global society]{.underline}** and
development. **[They are comprehensively connected in vision and
purpose]{.underline}**. This case study identifies three specific ways
in which [**[these two global agreements are connected]{.underline}**:
**[in shared principles; complementary processes; and mutually
re-enforcing activities]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

**[The ATT and]{.underline}** the **[SDGs]{.underline}** **[share a
similarity of purpose --]{.underline}** both have been negotiated with
outcomes at the global level, and delegate implementation to be
undertaken at the national level. **[[Meaningful implementation of the
ATT requires States]{.mark} Parties [to rely on]{.mark} a number of
[tools and strategies put forward by]{.mark} the
[SDGs]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and in turn, **[effective implementation
of the ATT should contribute significantly to the achievement of key
SDGs]{.underline}**. Whereas this case study will explore the
implications of positive meaningful implementation of both the ATT and
the SDGs, **[this symbiotic relationship]{.underline}** also **[serves
as a caution]{.underline}** - **[inadequate implementation of either the
ATT or the SDGs would risk undermining the success of

## Gender-Based Violence

### Climate Change

#### Removing barriers against women is crucial to solving climate change

**[Wedeman 18]{.underline}** (Nicholas Wedeman, Technical Advisor,

Advisor, Research Utilization, FHI 360, August 2018, "Invest in Girls

**[Recognizing the burdens environmental challenges impose on
them]{.underline}**, **[women have a key role to play]{.underline}**
**[when it comes to climate change mitigation]{.underline}** and
adaptation. Yet **[[women]{.mark} [experience
barriers]{.mark}]{.underline}**---social, political, and
economic---**[[that restrict their ability to take an active seat
at]{.mark} the table in [climate change
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}** and policy planning, **[further
limiting their opportunities]{.underline}** when it comes to mitigating,
adapting and coping with the effects of climate change.25,26 **[Women
must be recognized as vital agents of change]{.underline}** so that
their needs and their contributions will be a part of the solution. The
United Nations has recently prioritized safeguarding the rights of
people whose lives are most impacted by climate change, recognizing the
direct role the environment plays in shaping the economic and social
rights of so many individuals.27 Yet **[despite the steadily growing
body of evidence that shows that climate change]{.underline}** is an
obstacle to sustainable development and **[demonstrates a link to an
increase in female vulnerability]{.underline}** and therefore a rise in
gender inequality, **[the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) largely neglected]{.underline}** to outline any
**[gender dimensions]{.underline}** in its early years.28 That began to
change in 2007 with the release of the UNFCCC Bali Action Plan and the
establishment of the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA).29
However, it remains to be seen whether gender issues and the critical
role women play in addressing climate change will gain traction in
international negotiations.30 One promising development is that most
observers agreed that good progress was made regarding gender at the
2016 Conference of Parties to UNFCCC (COP) in Marrakesh compared to the
Lima, Peru talks in 2014. The COP22 saw more negotiating blocks,
including the developing country blocks, which came out in support for
stronger mechanisms to address gender at the international and national
levels.31 â For more, please reference the brief focused on Respecting,
Protecting, and Fulfilling Sexual Health and Rights.

This trend needs to gain traction in the era of the SDGs. Women's
leadership and political participation is a crucial element to any
discussions on climate change. They must be at the table during all
stages and at all levels of decision-making that seeks to find solutions
to current and future environmental realities. Yet at the local,
regional, national, and international levels, women are still fighting
for a leadership role in the climate change dialogue and a place at the
negotiation tables.

SECTION 2: SOLUTIONS AND INTERVENTIONS

The evidence-based solutions presented below are underutilized, but they
have vast potential to ensure that women are able to claim their roles
in all efforts to conserve the environment and tackle climate change:

• Include women within all climate change mitigation and adaptation
efforts

• Improve and enforce land rights for women

• Promote and fund women-led and women-focused sustainable food
production strategies, including fair trade, and resource management
activities

• Integrate environmental conservation and climate change adaptation and
mitigation with women's health programming

• Invest in and promote technologies that enhance renewable and clean
energy sources and support women's participation and leadership in their
development and use

Include Women Within All Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation
Efforts

**[Women have a unique understanding of the impact climate
change]{.underline}** is having on the productive assets they depend
upon. **[Their role must be acknowledged]{.underline}**, valued, and
incorporated into the development of sustainable approaches to climate
change adaptation and mitigation.

**[Women]{.underline}** often **[show more concern for the environment
by supporting pro-environmental policies and leaders]{.underline}**.32
**[[Increasing their influence in politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
decision-making forums, therefore, could **[[contribute towards
achieving environmental goals]{.underline}]{.mark}**.33 Yet while
progress has been made in the last five years boosting women's
representation in political and decision-making bodies, the **[gender
gap remains significant]{.underline}**; as of 2017, only 23% of
parliamentarians were women.34 Women are also not equally represented in
governance bodies concerning the environment; a survey in 65 different
countries found that only 35% of environmental sector ministries have a
gender focal point, ranging from more than half of ministries of
agriculture having a focal point, and less than one-fourth of ministries
of water having one.35 â For more, please reference the brief focused on
Strengthening Women's Political Participation and Decision-Making Power.

To adapt to the negative impacts of climate change, **[women must have a
voice and be engaged in leadership]{.underline}** and decision-making
roles---not only by assuming political office, but by participating in
the planning and implementation of sustainable natural resource
management practices, as well as climate change mitigation and
adaptation interventions, including at the local and village level.
**[Disaster Risk Reduction]{.underline}**---the practice of systematic
analysis and mitigation of the causes of disasters, including reducing
exposure to hazards, lessening the vulnerability of people and property,
wise management of land and environment, and improving preparedness and
early warning for adverse events---**[is only effective
when]{.underline}** girls and **[women are involved and wield
decision-making power]{.underline}**.36,37 And they must share in the
fruits of these efforts. Research has shown that **[when women are in
decision-making]{.underline}** and leadership **[roles there is a
positive impact on sustainable natural resource
management]{.underline}** and climate change adaptation activities.38
Since adapting to a changing climate is an inescapable reality---even if
emissions are halted today---advocacy and decision-making efforts must
also include the voices of adolescents and youth, as they have an
essential role to play in future efforts related to climate change
mitigation and adaptation.39

Case Study: The Africa Adaptation Program (AAP) The Africa Adaptation
Program (AAP) addressed women's roles in climate change in Nigeria by
boosting their skills and knowledge with regard to climate change
impacts, policy, financing, and negotiations. They focused on developing
women's leadership in key government ministries as it relates to climate
change. Many of the countries involved in the AAP program from 2008-2012
worked to revise budgeting processes so that they included funding
focused specifically on the gender-specific needs of many women
regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation.40 Improve and
Enforce Land Rights for Women

Land is an important resource for women. **[Having rights to land can
improve their ability to access capital,]{.underline}** **[derive
income]{.underline}**, protect household food security, and offer them
security in times of hardship. With secure tenure to land, individuals
and groups gain greater incentives to invest in soil conservation, plant
trees, and avoid deforestation.41 **[Research shows that when women own
land they not only have more secure livelihoods]{.underline}**,
**[but]{.underline}** that **[they]{.underline}** also **[gain status,
have greater bargaining power within their households,
and]{.underline}** in some contexts **[are less likely to experience
domestic violence]{.underline}**.42 Yet land tenure systems often favor
men through laws and practices that dictate unequal access, use,
ownership, and control. Often times, **[women's secure land rights are
ignored as a key piece of climate change action]{.underline}** and
development.43 Prior to consensus on the Paris Agreement, countries were
required to submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).
In a review conducted by the Landesa Center for Women's Land Rights of
INDCs from 18 countries, only three touched on land rights, land reform,
or land tenure and none mentioned women's land rights.44 In order to
address the challenges imposed by climate change---and to find
effective, sustainable solutions---it is critical to secure land tenure
rights for women. For example, through the provision of legal land
rights, marginalized populations living in poverty are better able to
access new funding sources and opportunities, which can promote efforts
to curb climate change, and facilitate the receipt of compensation when
land is taken for conservation purposes or when climate-induced
disasters destroy fields and homes.45 Enforceable land rights will
improve the management of natural resources while boosting the economic
status of women.46

Promote and Fund Women-Led and Women-Focused Sustainable Food Production
Strategies, Including Fair Trade, and Resource Management Activities

As **[[women]{.mark} are often responsible for collecting
fuel]{.underline}**, as well as **[growing and preparing
food]{.underline}**, **[it is important that their expertise in resource
management be recognized and valued]{.underline}**. Much of the natural
resource base in rural areas is located on common lands; often times,
stemming from weak tenure rights, women can be barred from making
decisions concerning the use and management of these resources.47 For
example, women have less secure rights to land when compared to men, and
have less time to commit to their plots.48 Despite this barrier, as the
key providers of food at the household level, **[women]{.underline}**
frequently **[[have a greater understanding]{.mark} [of the impact
climate change is having on the local
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.49 **[They are]{.underline}** often
**[the knowledge-keepers of traditional and sustainable methods of
natural resource management;]{.underline}** when applied, these methods
result in more resilient communities and improved livelihoods.50 For
example, a **[gender-sensitive study]{.underline}** in the Amazon found
45 not previously **[documented edible species that could be used to
improve food security in the]{.underline}** region. This particular
instance highlights the need to include gender-cognizant strategies when
thinking about food security.51 Thus, **[[it is
critical]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[any discussion on climate
change mitigation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, impacts, and adaptation **[not
only include women, but [ensure they have an active decision-making
role]{.mark} in the process]{.underline}** and implementation.

One way in which women have the potential to support sustainable food
production is through participation in fair trade organizations.
Research from the Fairtrade Foundation shows that **[enabling women to
join organizations that grow produce could benefit
businesses]{.underline}**, **[support global development, and bring
gains for women]{.underline}**.52 Fairtrade certification has been shown
to increase calorie and micronutrient consumption, increase incomes, and
improve gender equity.53 As of 2015, women accounted for only 25% of the
farmers registered as members of certified fair trade small producer
organizations.54.55 In order to better equalize this gender divide,
businesses should conduct gender analyses of their supply and value
chains and develop a gender equality policy and action plan that they
can also share with their producer organizations.56 Governments in
producer countries can provide women with agronomy training programs and
ensure that there are loans and other support for people who do not own
land, especially women.57 Some organizations have taken it upon
themselves to encourage women's participation and support women's voices
in decision-making, such as Kuapa Kokoo, the Ghanaian cocoa cooperative,
which has formed district level gender committees; nearly half its
National Executive Council members, including the President, are
women.58

Women who are dependent on the natural environment for food and income
constitute 60% of people living in poverty and most vulnerable people.59
On average in the developing world, women constitute a sizeable portion
of the agricultural labor force60 and are thus extremely vulnerable to
failing agricultural production.61 Further, a drop in production
exacerbates vulnerabilities, as women do not have the same access to
financial and other resources, such as climate, weather, and market
information, as men do to cope with the impacts of climate induced
natural resource depletion.62,63,64 The agricultural sector is also one
of the leading emitters of greenhouse gases.65 Therefore it is important
for women working in agriculture to be involved with climate change
mitigation. Once engaged, these women can incorporate Climate-Smart
Agricultural (CSA) practices and sustainable farming into their daily
lives, thus increasing food security for themselves and their
families.66 Some of these practices include water management, terracing,
composting, incorporating high-yielding and stress-tolerant varieties of
crops, and pasture management.67 â

For more, please reference the brief focused on Boosting Women's
Economic Empowerment.

**[Indigenous women]{.underline}**---who often play vital roles as
stewards of nature---**[are particularly impacted by the effects of
climate]{.underline}** **[change]{.underline}**.68 In most cases,
**[indigenous women are responsible for their families' food
security]{.underline}** and survive off of the land; as such, they feel
the impacts of climate change on a daily basis.69 **[[In order to
protect biodiversity and reduce degradation]{.mark} of the environment,
[indigenous women need to be recognized for their leadership]{.mark}
role in mitigating the devastating effects of climate
change]{.underline}** and facilitating climate change adaptation
efforts.70

Case Study: Climate-Smart Agriculture in Kenya In 2011, a pilot project
in Kenya focusing on female small-scale farmers and dairy farmers
incorporated Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) as a means of improving
yields, income, and wellbeing. Women in the Kamotony region, who were
concerned about their economic stability, were trained in CSA practices
and decided collectively to start a tree nursery. This tree nursery
provided a new source of income from the sale of seedlings and tree
cuttings; the women were able to invest in dairy production with the
profits. By applying the CSA techniques, such as feed storage and fodder
production, the women were able to increase dairy production. The women
now report that their household food security, nutrition, and income
have increased due to CSA practices. They also are able to fund their
children's education and healthcare without the economic difficultly
that they previously faced.71

Case Study: Crop Diversification in Nicaragua With resources from a
community fund, local women in Jinotega, Nicaragua conducted a risk
mapping exercise to identify new solutions for improving food
production. They then received training, seeds, and tools, and
collectively decided how the agricultural land could be used
differently. After five years the number of diversified plots in the
community quadrupled, and crop production for household use increased
five-fold. Within the same period, each farmer's annual net earnings
increased roughly six-fold.72

Case Study: Applying Local Knowledge to Crop Production A UN-funded
project in the high plains of Bolivia relied upon traditional community
knowledge of weather to improve crop production and avert risks imposed
by climate change. The emphasis on applying women's knowledge of the
environment -- with regard to proper crop and seed storage, for example
-- was key to the project's success. As a result of this
gender-sensitive collaboration, more than 100 context-specific
agricultural technologies and practices were either introduced or
re-introduced to the community to lessen the potential effects of
climate change.73

Integrate Environmental Conservation and Climate Change Adaptation and
Mitigation with Women's Health Programming

**[Countries]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** the highest **[unmet
need for contraception]{.underline}** also tend to **[have the fastest
growing populations]{.underline}**, **[the highest projected declines in
agricultural production]{.underline}**, **[and the greatest
vulnerability to climate change]{.underline}**.74 Without boosting
investments to meet the current demand for sexual and reproductive
health services, nations could erase important gains made in
environmental and biodiversity conservation, impede adaptation for
climate change, and roll back recent improvements in health, education,
and gender equality. Improving access to and the availability of
voluntary family planning has been shown to be one effective way to
remediate the effects of climate change, including addressing food
security gaps resulting from decreased crop productivity and slowing
emissions.75,76 **[One team]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** several
dozen **[[researchers]{.underline}]{.mark}** who **[set
out]{.underline}** to "map, measure, and model" **[the 100 most
substantive solutions to climate change]{.underline}**, using only
peer-reviewed research, **[named [the number one solution]{.mark} a
combination of voluntary [family planning and girls
education]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.77]{.mark}

However, despite ample recognition of the importance of voluntary family
planning's role in climate change adaptation, **[family
planning]{.underline}** **[does not often receive climate change
adaptation fundin]{.underline}**g.78,79 **[Adaptation strategies should
reflect multi-sectoral approaches and provide funding to
known]{.underline}**, effective approaches, especially those that
effectively meet the current unmet demand for contraception.80,81
Importantly, **[all of these efforts should be rooted in rights-based
approaches to voluntary family planning and sexual and reproductive
health and rights.]{.underline}**

**[One promising strategy is]{.underline}** the population, health, and
environment (PHE) approach, which involves linking efforts to improve
environment and climate change **[adaptation efforts with voluntary
family planning and women's health]{.underline}**. Projects have shown
that **[the integrated nature of population]{.underline}**, health, and
environment **[has increased women's participation in natural resource
management]{.underline}** and uptake of voluntary **[family
planning]{.underline}**.82 PHE operates under a rights-based approach,
asserting the right of all people to have a satisfying and safe sex
life, the choice to reproduce, and the freedom to decide if, when, and
how often to do so.83 One example, the Sustaining Partnerships to
Enhance Rural Enterprise and Agribusiness Development (SPREAD) project
in Rwanda, incorporated technical assistance to communities who make
their livelihoods from the coffee sector. This approach also included an
integrated health component which incorporated health education aimed at
reaching farmers. Preliminary reports pointed to the project's impact on
greater support and demand for voluntary family planning and its links
to family-wide health and economic benefits.84 And **[a 2015 synthesis
of multiple assessments of PHE programming suggests that]{.underline}**,
given the clear linkages and significant potential, **[more efforts are
needed to rigorously document the impact of dually addressing voluntary
family planning]{.underline}** **[services and climate change
adaptation]{.underline}**.85

Case Study: Blue Ventures in Madagascar Blue Ventures has been working
in Madagascar to incorporate sexual and reproductive health services
with sustainable coastal livelihood and resource management initiatives.
This integrated approach addresses the interconnected challenges of poor
health, unmet family planning needs, environmental degradation, and food
insecurity in a holistic way. It enables communities to manage their
resources sustainably, both now and for the future. These approaches
enable couples to better provide for their families by decreasing crude
birth rates, improving food security, and empowering women to play an
impactful role in resource management. Since Blue Ventures began in
2007, it is estimated that over 3,825 unintended pregnancies have been
averted within a population of 20,000.86

Case Study: The Watershed Management Project in Ethiopia The Watershed
Management Project in eastern Ethiopia ran between 2005 and 2007 and
aimed to sustainably improve crop production and limit biodiversity loss
in a region of 3000 rural households.87 The project strategy was
threefold: train inhabitants and local organizations in sustainable land
management practices and ecosystem awareness; rehabilitate uplands and
wetlands through reforestation; and promote modern, voluntary family
planning methods and HIV/AIDS awareness by inviting health professionals
to participate in environmental training.88 After four years the Project
showed tangible results, such as improved irrigation, compost, and
tree-planting methods that have reversed soil degradation trends and
improved nutritional levels, thus reducing the need to cut back the
forest.89 By integrating voluntary family planning and HIV/AIDS
awareness, the Project has helped to ensure that these environmental
benefits are sustainable, even in the event of rapid population growth,
and are complemented by improved sexual and reproductive health.90
Invest In and Promote Technologies That Enhance Renewable and Clean
Energy Sources and Support Women's Participation in their Development
and Use

Close to 2.9 billion people in the developing world still use solid
fuels to heat and cook, which is directly linked to emissions that cause
climate change.91 Such polluting fuels include wood, coal, and charcoal,
and the negative health effects of their use are dire.92 In 2012, 4.3
million people died prematurely in lowand middle-income countries from
household air pollution.93 The economic, health, and environmental cost
of inefficient cooking is a staggering \$123 billion per year.94

Around the world, women are more adversely affected by energy
poverty---the cumulative impact of higher health and safety risks
stemming from inefficient lighting, household air pollution, and
polluting cooking fuels.95 Yet **[[if women had the]{.mark} economic and
social [power to make better energy
choices]{.mark}]{.underline}**---including the purchase and use of clean
energy sources such as cookstoves and high-efficiency fuels---**[[it
would]{.mark} help [turn the tide of climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}**.96 Technology justice serves to advance
the rights of groups who are in the greatest need of technological
innovation to have access to technological advances.97 Often
**[technological research tends to focus on the wealthy and lacks regard
for social and environmental costs]{.underline}** on other people and
the environment; these trends need to be reversed so that all people can
access environmentally-friendly technologies that enhance wellbeing.98

Currently **[women make up about 35% of the renewable energy sector work
force]{.underline}**, although this varies significantly by country and
by product.99 **[Bringing women into the workforce is a
win-win.]{.underline}** **[Female entrepreneurs]{.underline}**
**[would]{.underline}** then **[have access to consumers and could
promote new solutions,]{.underline}** innovative technologies, and clean
energy products.100 This enables household consumers to choose safe,
clean energy. **[[Gender inclusivity]{.underline}]{.mark}** within the
energy sector **[[is crucial to driving climate change
mitigation]{.mark}, as well as inclusive economic
gains.101]{.underline}**

Case Study: Solar Sisters Harnesses the Power of Women to Promote Clean
Energy By creating a woman-centered sales network that brings clean
energy technology to rural Africa, Solar Sisters is working to eradicate
energy poverty and economically empower women through a direct sales
network to sell solar energy products and clean cookstoves. Solar
Sisters currently works in Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania, and their
programming boasts over 2,000 female entrepreneurs; their efforts to
promote clean energy are reaching 300,000 beneficiaries.102

You might have heard that President Donald **[[Trump struck another

**[[and would no longer]{.underline}]{.mark}** seek to **[[ratify
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** landmark **[agreement]{.underline}**
regulating the international trade in conventional weapons. With great
flair and flourish, Trump signed a letter while onstage at the National
Rifle Association's annual conference asking for the Senate to return
the Arms Trade Treaty to the White House so it could "be disposed of."
While **[this act]{.underline}** may prove politically expedient for
Trump in the short term, it **[is wrought with longer-term strategic and
diplomatic challenges that could haunt the]{.underline}**

**[What Does the Arms Trade Treaty Do?]{.underline}**

Contrary to the president's statement, [**[the]{.underline}**
**[A]{.underline}**]{.mark}rms **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty **[[does not limit U.S. sovereignty
over arms export decisions]{.mark}, nor does it put a foreign government
in charge of U.S. domestic regulations. [The treaty
regulates]{.mark}]{.underline}** only the **[[international trade in
conventional arms]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- that's all weapons **[[from
small arms to fighter jets]{.underline}]{.mark}** and everything in
between. **[Its]{.underline}** stated **[purpose is to contribute to
international peace and security and reduce human
suffering]{.underline}** caused by the irresponsible and illicit arms
trade. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rms
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty also
**[[promotes transparency and accountability in
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** global **[[arms trade]{.mark} by requiring
governments to report annually on their arms]{.underline}** exports and
imports, building confidence in what has historically been an opaque
business.

**[[The treaty encourages governments to stop supplying lethal
weapons]{.mark} of war to human rights abusers, [violators of
international humanitarian]{.mark} law, [terrorists, and organized
crimin]{.mark}als by prohibiting certain kinds of arms
transfers]{.underline}** **[and establishing specific criteria for
making arms transfer decisions (]{.underline}**all of which are already
reflected in U.S. law and regulations). These are not controversial
measures. It is common sense to ensure that the weapons the United
States sells are used for the purposes intended and do not undermine
American national security interests, foreign policy objectives,
economic priorities, or principles and values.

In simple terms, the Arms Trade Treaty tells governments what to do in
order to participate in the arms trade responsibly, but not how to do
it. It provides a flexible approach that allows governments to
right-size their national arms transfer control systems --- the laws,
regulations, and policies that governments have to control arms moving
into, out of, and through their territories. Not everyone needs a system
as sophisticated as the United States, for example --- no other country
does as much arms trading. But the treaty mandates that participating
governments have national control systems with control lists of items
that are subject to import, export, brokering and transit and
transshipment regulations. These requirements are common-sense elements
of every national control system. They do not create a burden. Rather,
they simply make legitimate trade more efficient and help curb diversion
of legal weapons to illegal markets. For example, the treaty requires
governments to develop laws and regulations for arms brokering ---
closing a loophole that has allowed nefarious arms brokers to skirt a
patchwork of national laws and avoid detection. While Trump's remarks
seriously misrepresent the nature and purpose of the treaty, he was
right about one thing: **[Most Americans have never heard of the Arms
Trade Treaty.]{.underline}** The treaty was negotiated over a five-year
period that began in the George W. Bush administration, was adopted by
the U.N. General Assembly in April 2013, and was signed by
then-Secretary of State John Kerry several months later.

I spent those years as the consultant to the treaty process --- from its
beginnings as a group of governmental experts examining the scope,
parameters, and feasibility of an Arms Trade Treaty through two
negotiating conferences. One of the reasons I was selected as the
consultant was because I was an American who understood the U.S. export
control system and the concerns of U.S. negotiators. I worked closely
with the conference presidents and diplomats from the United States and
around the world looking for compromises in text language to develop a
treaty that made a meaningful difference. **[Having the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[on
board,]{.underline}** as the world's largest arms exporter, **[was
important to the diplomats negotiating the treaty, and [sacrifices
were]{.mark} [made]{.mark} by those demanding stronger]{.underline}**
and more specific **[language in order [to keep
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[at the
table]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

With all the concessions made to get the United States to sign on to the
treaty, unfortunately, the Obama administration never sold the treaty's
virtues to the American public or Congress. This neglect allowed a false
narrative about the Arms Trade Treaty --- largely propagated by
conservative groups and gun-rights activists, such as those at the
National Rifle Association --- to take hold and dominate the discussion.
**[[With no champions on the Hill,]{.mark} [the treaty has been allowed
to languish in the Senate since it was first transmitted]{.mark} for
consideration of ratification in 2016 with no action.]{.underline}**

Getting Up from the Table

Even though the U.S. government remained silent on the Arms Trade Treaty
domestically, it actively participated in discussions on the treaty
internationally at the working group level and at Conferences of States
Parties, speaking up when proposals were not in the U.S. interest or
when diplomats tried to interpret the treaty in ways inconsistent with
the actual text. Participation in these meetings has helped ensure that
U.S. perspectives and interests were heard and taken into consideration
as the treaty matured. [**[In walking away]{.underline}** **[from the
treaty]{.underline}**]{.mark} now, [**[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[will have to rely on other countries to serve]{.mark} as guarantors

**[Treaty critics]{.underline}**, including the president himself,
**[point out]{.underline}** that **[Russia and China remain outside the

Where to from Here?

The Arms Trade Treaty is aspirational, but it does not act in isolation.
The treaty is not a panacea to solve every problem associated with the
global transfer and use of conventional weapons but rather is one tool
in a diverse and varied toolbox available for states to ensure
responsibility in the international arms trade. And while there are
problems with the treaty text --- due to compromises made to get the
United States on board the treaty --- more than 100 governments are
party to the treaty (including most U.S. allies), and more than 30
additional governments have signed on to it, cementing new norms and
standards for operating in a previously unregulated global arms trade.
The Arms Trade Treaty will survive without the United States, but
**[[not having the world's largest]{.mark} [arms exporter]{.mark} inside
the treaty [undermines its intent]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[U.S. negotiators saw this treaty as an opportunity to raise other
countries up to the U.S. standard]{.underline}** and level the playing
field for American industry, **[which was subject to stricter national
controls]{.underline}** and more complicated bureaucratic processes than
those found in other countries. [**[U.S. negotiators]{.underline}**
**[recognized]{.underline}**]{.mark} that **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rms **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty **[[would face a challenging political
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}** within the United States
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** therefore **[[made it
clear]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[the treaty did not create
additional responsibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** or burdens **[for
U.S. industry]{.underline}**, **[nor require changes to U.S.
laws]{.underline}** or regulations. U.S. industry supported these
efforts because they seek efficiency and predictability in an
increasingly globalized market. Nothing will change for U.S. exporters
when the United States unsigns the treaty, as they will still be subject
to strict U.S. export control laws. But, **[these]{.underline}**
**[exporters could see their supply chains or access to customers put at
risk if a trading partner puts limits with those countries that are not
signatories or parties to the treaty.]{.underline}**

As mentioned, on April 29, the president sent a letter to the Senate
saying that ratification of the treaty is not in America's interest and
asking for it to be returned to the White House. Once that occurs, the
president should stay quiet on the Arms Trade Treaty. He has
accomplished his political objectives and given a win to an embattled
special interest group. Another administration can reconsider the U.S.
role in the Arms Trade Treaty in the future and seek treaty
ratification. But the damage to the U.S. relationship with partners and
allies will likely take longer to repair. The United States has sent a
signal with this announcement --- that it will no longer be bound by the
object and purpose of the Arms Trade Treaty. **[[Not having
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates as a treaty partner **[[legitimizes
the irresponsible transfers of countries like Russia]{.mark}, Iran, and
North Korea. [It tells governments]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[they
do not have to utilize restraint]{.mark} in their arms transfer
decisions]{.underline}**. Yes, the United States will continue to follow
its national laws and regulations, but **[[the bad behavior of those
countries]{.mark} that do not have such strict standards [has]{.mark}
now [become]{.mark} much [harder for the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[to condone]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[has not only weakened its
commitment to]{.underline}** promoting and **[ensuring responsibility in
global arms transfers, it [has left a hole in leadership and undermined
its negotiating position]{.mark} in the future.]{.underline}** For now,
**[we must live with the consequences of this foolish decision and hope
the U.S. reputation can recover]{.underline}** from yet another
rejection of international engagement.

### Latin America

#### Ammunition perpetuates conflicts in Latin America\-\--they're the sine qua non to causing violence.

**[Bleinroth 18]{.underline}** (Marcus Bleinroth, Director of Division,
Conventional Disarmament, Arms Control and CSBM, Preventive Arms
Control, 2018, "AMMUNITION CONTROL PRACTICES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE
CARIBBEAN", UNLIREC,

Introduction The Importance of Ammunition Controls PART I "What is a gun
without any bullets?"1 "**[[Stop a bullet, stop a
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**."2 "The indispensable complement to any
weapon",3 "the fuel of conflict",4 "the oxygen of armed violence".
"People don't die of gun wounds, they die of bullet wounds."5
"**[[Ammunition transforms]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[Small Arms and Light
Weapons\] **[from inoperative objects into lethal weapons that can be
used to take away human lives and devastate
communities]{.underline}**."6 "Once they enter the body, they fragment
and explode, pulverizing bones, tearing blood vessels and liquefying
organs."7

**[Much has been]{.underline}** rightfully written **[about the
essential role [ammunition]{.mark} plays in "escalating,
[prolong]{.mark}ing, [and intensify]{.mark}ing [armed conflict and
crim]{.mark}]{.underline}**[e]{.mark},"8 **[not the least because
"weapons often last for decades,]{.underline}** but ammunition can only
be used once".9 **[[In some regions, a lack of ammunition supply "has
brought]{.mark} about [the neardisappearance of certain]{.mark} types of
[weapon", such as]{.mark} the case of [the G3 assault rifle in East
Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}**.10 **[Once diverted from the legal market,
"it is]{.underline}** arguably more **[important to understand
trafficking in small arms ammunition than it is trafficking in small
arms and light weapons, because [maintaining a regular supply of
ammunition is crucial to sustaining conflict and armed criminal
activity]{.mark}]{.underline}**."11

**[In Latin America and the Caribbean, [constant supply]{.mark},
availability and proliferation of ammunition to all potential actors of
violence]{.underline}** -- **[[either through use in criminal activity,
misuse by State forces, interpersonal violence between
civilians,]{.mark} or incidents with private security
forces]{.underline}** [-- **[are a sine qua non to producing the
region's]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[macabre [armed violence]{.mark}
records]{.underline}**. If indeed "**[firearms are more frequently used
in homicides in Latin America]{.underline}** and the Caribbean than
elsewhere in the world,"12 the same can be said of bullets. Semantics,
perhaps, but these daily human tragedies are not only "firearmrelated
homicides" but also, essentially, "ammunition-related homicides" and
must be treated as such if seeking policies to diminish the body count.

Indeed, **[ammunition]{.underline}** "arguably **[constitutes the most
lethal part of any weapon system]{.underline}**".13 In isolation,
**[ammunition is]{.underline}** certainly **[more dangerous than the
firearms]{.underline}** it renders lethal, given the risks of explosive
accidents, the so-called unplanned explosions at munitions sites (UEMS),
even if these are most likely in depots with ammunition for light
weapons or military-grade explosives, than when storing small arms
ammunition -- the focus of this report -- alone.

#### The illicit spread of arms causes [(MAYBE TOO MANY ALT CAUSES)]{.mark}

**[Amnesty 17]{.underline}** (Amnesty International, 2017, "The State of
the World's Human Rights", Amnesty International,

Widespread and entrenched obstacles to accessing justice and a weakening
rule of law were common to many countries in the region. **[Impunity for
human rights abuses was high, and in some cases a lack of independent
and impartial judicial systems further protected political and economic
interests.]{.underline}**

This backdrop enabled the perpetuation of human rights violations.
**[Torture]{.underline}** **[and other illtreatment]{.underline}**, in
particular, **[remained prevalent]{.underline}**, despite the existence
of anti-torture laws **[in countries including Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela.]{.underline}**

Failures of justice systems -- together with states' failure to
implement public security policies that protect human rights --
contributed to high levels of violence. Countries such as Brazil, El
Salvador, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico and Venezuela had the highest
homicide rates on the planet.

**[[Endemic violence and insecurity were]{.underline}]{.mark}** often
**[[linked to]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and compounded **[by, [the
proliferation of illicit small arms and the growth of organized
crime]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[which]{.underline}**]{.mark} in some
cases **[[had taken control of whole territories]{.mark}, [sometimes
with the complicity]{.mark} or]{.underline}** acquiescence **[[of
the]{.mark} police and [military]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Central America's "Northern Triangle]{.mark}" of El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras [was one of the world's most violent
places]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[with]{.underline}** **[more people
killed there than in most conflict zones
globally]{.underline}**]{.mark}. El Salvador's homicide rate of 108 per
100,000 inhabitants was one of the highest in the world. For many,
**[daily life was overshadowed by criminal gangs.]{.underline}**
