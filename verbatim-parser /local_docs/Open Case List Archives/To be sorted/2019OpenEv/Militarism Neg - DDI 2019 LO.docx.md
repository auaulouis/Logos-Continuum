"It has been China's dream for a century to become the world's leading
nation," wrote Liu Mingfu, then a colonel in the People's Liberation
Army, in his 2010 bookThe China Dream. [After taking over as general
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, Xi
Jinping [echoed](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578348774040546346) the
book's language and one of its key themes---"the dream of a strong
military"]{.underline}---repeatedly in speeches. This dream, he said,
would be realized by 2049, a century after the founding of the People's
Republic of China.

government [published](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/26/content_20820628.htm) a
defense-policy white paper laying out an expanded role for the navy in
the context of U.S.-China tensions over China's construction of islands
in disputed waters in the South China Sea.]{.underline} [The U.S.
government [estimates](http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-proposes-challenge-to-china-sea-claims-1431463920) that
Beijing has created 2,000 acres of artificial land in the Spratly
Islands, parts of which are also claimed by other nearby
countries.]{.underline} U.S. Defense Secretary Ash

region; a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman responded that the
construction was "legal, reasonable ... and neither impacts nor targets
any country."

[The United States

and Liu is essentially an America hawk within China]{.underline}. After
the initial publication of Liu's book, Phillip C. Saunders of the U.S.
National Defense
University [called](http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36217#.VW4W-GRVikq) it
a "sensationalist" tract "aimed at tapping into a profitable mass market
\... rather than \[promoting\] political orthodoxy," and the book
appears to have put its publisher briefly at odds with the
government. The Wall Street
Journal [reported](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578348774040546346) that The
China Dream "flew off the shelves but was pulled over concerns it could
damage relations with the U.S." In the Xi era, however, the Journal's
Jeremy Page spotted it in the "recommended books" section of a state-run
bookstore.
(Liu [told](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578348774040546346) Page
he didn't know whether Xi himself had read it, but said Xi's "China
Dream" speeches had sent "a strong message.")

Liu is representative of a new class of pundits in China that
former Financial TimesBeijing bureau chief Geoff Dyer has compared to
America's "[TV
generals](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2003/03/the_tv_generals.html),"
retired officers who opine on military matters in the media. "In the
last few years," Dyer wrote in his book The Contest of the Century,
"something similar has happened in China. [A small number of
media-friendly members of the armed forces have begun to talk openly
about military matters, including their mistrust of and distaste for the
U.S. military and its policies in Asia]{.underline}. \... In some ways,
Senior Colonel Liu Mingfu is the latest addition to their numbers."

Th[e colonel has now retired from the military, and the path to global
dominance he laid out five years ago was a bit more flexible than
Xi']{.underline}s[; Liu reckoned it might take China another five
decades to replace the United States as world leade]{.underline}r.
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has called the book an example
of a "triumphalist" strain in Chinese thinking,
which [argues](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703864204576315223305697158) that
"no matter how much China commits itself to a 'peaceful rise,' conflict
is inherent in U.S.-China relations." Kissinger noted that the hawks'
vision of inevitable U.S.-China conflict hasn't been endorsed by either
the Chinese or the American governments, but that "if the assumptions of
these views were applied by either side---and it would only take one
side to make it unavoidable---China and the U.S. could easily fall into
an escalating tension."

What follows is a condensed excerpt of one Chinese hawk's view of what
the "China Age" will look like, and his roadmap for how China will get
there. [It outlines a vision of Chinese superiority informed by the
experience of America's own rise to superpower status and conduct as the
world's preeminent power.]{.underline} His descriptions are general, and
his prescriptions vague, [but he asserts that the Chinese century will
be a democratic one. If this strikes Americans as incongruous given
China's [domestic
system](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/05/chinese-democracy-isnt-inevitable/394325/),
Liu's contention is that America itself is only "half
democratic"---electing its leaders at home but "autocratic in the
world.]{.underline}" He continues: "Americans overrate themselves and
evaluate themselves untruthfully by saying that they are a democratic
country." And it is China that in Liu's view can provide the "checks and
balances" against America necessary to "form a democratic world."

The appearance of every champion nation begins a new era. [The China
Age, at its most basic, will be an age of prosperity. In \[early Chinese
revolutionary\] Sun Yat-sen's evaluation of the West's conception of
Yellow Peril, he said that in the future, China's era would not be one
of Yellow Peril, but of Yellow Favor. The China Age will not be one in
which China threatens the world, it will be one in which China enriches
the world.]{.underline}

America's GDP surpassed Great Britain's in 1895 to become the world's
largest. \[Editor's note: OECD estimates show U.S. per-capita
GDP [overtaking](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7174996.stm) that of
the United Kingdom sometime in the 1890s.\] But it was only after 1945,
half a century after America's GDP outpaced Great Britain's, [that the
United States replaced Great Britain as world leader. China's GDP is
still smaller than America's; it may take China 50 years to overtake
America's GDP and replace it as world leader. There is still no need for
America to be nervous. China should not be in a rush to be a leader; it
should allow America to keep the position until a time that is best for
all sides.]{.underline}

Before China can take over as world leader in the 21st century, it will
need half a century to work through three stages. [The first will be
catching up to America and actively taking a leading role where it can
in the world; the second will be racing neck-and-neck with America, and
leading the world as an equal partner with America; and the third stage
will be guiding the world through exercising leadership and management
in the world, and thereby becoming the world's leading nation. China is
already actively participating in leadership where it can, and moving
toward becoming America's equal. This stage will last for another 20 to
30 years.]{.underline}

In 1987, American history professor Paul Kennedy of Yale University
researched the favorable and adverse conditions surrounding China's
rise. [He pointed out that China was the poorest of the countries
wishing to be a great power and occupied the worst strategic
position.]{.underline} These, he said, were two adverse conditions that
would limit China's rise, but he also pointed out two favorable
conditions: one was that [China's leaders had "an ambitious, coherent,
and visionary strategy, one that could beat Moscow, Washington, and
Tokyo, not to mention Western Europe"; the other was that "China would
continue to develop economically, and could be a vastly different
country within several decades."]{.underline}

[His analysis of China's strategy was very accurate. China's rise was,
before all else, the rise of its strategy.]{.underline}

China's rise and revival cannot be limited to a strictly economic rise,
and China's role as a great power cannot be limited to a major economic
role. [Those who think China's rise is not an ideological and military
rise, or who think China's rise is just an economic rise, and that China
is only rising to become an economic power or a GDP power, are making a
strategic mistake. A rich nation without a strong military is an
insecure power]{.underline}. A nation without technological innovation
is a country that can't produce a scientific rise, and in an era where
the knowledge economy is the most productive force, it is a country that
can't be strong economically. [If China limits its rise to purely
economic goals, it will produce a hobbled global power, a kind of global
power that doesn't last]{.underline}. To create a nation like that would
be equivalent to cutting short China's rise and the revival of the
Chinese people.

#### China is an independently militaristic actor that only the US can regulate, South China Sea proves

(Colin **Clark** , Thu **7/11**/2019, Breaking Defense, "China Seeks
'Hegemony' in Asia: Adm. Harris, PACOM" , Colin is an Editor for the
breakingmedia in the article he is directly quoting Admiral Harry
Harris,
[https://thedisorderofthings.com/2015/10/02/thinking-internationally-about-the-arms-trade/](about:blank))

WASHINGTON: The gloves came off during today's Senate Armed Services
committee hearing on China and North Korea with Pacific Command's Adm.
Harry Harris saying that [China seeks "hegemony in East Asia" and is
unequivocally militarizing the South China Sea.]{.underline} ["In my
opinion, China is clearly militarizing its position in the South China
Sea. You'd have to believe in a flat earth to believe
otherwise,"]{.underline} Harris told [the]{.underline} committee this
morning. But [Chinese]{.underline} president Xi Jinping continues to
claim that China is not militarizing the South China Sea, even though
his [regime is violating international law by building these islands in
the first place, are building military-length runways on them and are
stationing missiles and advanced radar sets on them.]{.underline} Until
very recently, US military officials were at pains to characterize China
as a sometimes challenging partner in international affairs, one they
characterized as a rising peer competitor but never as an opponent or an
enemy. Saying China wants to be a hegemon --- which is what China
denounced the United States as for much of the last 50 years --- comes
perilously close to characterizing China as an opponent. Harris'
comments are not there yet, but we are edging closer to a Cold War in
the Pacific. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies issued this detailed assessment of
the situation yesterday: "This month's deployment of HQ-9 surface-to-air
missiles on Woody Island in the Paracels, while notable, does not alter
the military balance in the South China Sea. New radar facilities being
developed in the Spratlys, on the other hand, could significantly change
the operational landscape in the South China Sea. And along with the
development of new runways and air defense capabilities, they speak to a
long-term anti-access strategy by China---one that would see it
establish effective control over the sea and airspace throughout the
South China Sea." China, of course, blames the United States for
militarizing the South China Sea because we are executing legal Freedom
of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) such as flying over the fake Chinese
islands and sailing near them. [Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong
Lei told reporters Saturday that those US actions, combined with
exercises involving regional partners, were the reasons the sea is being
militarized. China is really only trying to help the world by building
these islands, putting up lighthouses, building military-length runways,
stationing missiles and advanced radar sets on them and claiming they
are sovereign China territory --- although international law says
otherwise.]{.underline} "The above actions have escalated tensions in
the South China Sea, and that's the real militarization of the South
China Sea," Hong said. Since China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi is in town
today, and Adm. Harris doubtless knows this, you can take his comments
as a direct shot at the Chinese claims to only safeguarding their
rightful territorial claims. Harris also restated the US intention to
"routinely" execute Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China
Sea. One other very interesting tidbit surfaced during today's hearing
when Sen. Kelly Ayotte pressed Harris about a gap in US attack submarine
capabilities. Harris confirmed that the US can only meet 62 percent of
the requests for attack submarines from commanders and that this
particularly affects the Pacific theater. "My requirements are not being
met," Harris told Sen. Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, who followed
up on Ayotte's question. "That's a function of global demands." Ayotte,
who hails from New Hampshire where the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard sits,
was particularly interested in shortfalls in attack submarines. They
are, of course, maintained and overhauled at Portsmouth. Blumenthal's
state, Connecticut, is home to the Electric Board yard where both new
Virginia-class attack subs and --- in the near future --- new ICBM
submarines, known as boomers, are built.

[China's land grab and subsequent militarization of "islands" in the
South China Sea have finally dispelled the myth that its rise will be
peaceful. Indeed, these developments point to an unwelcome fact -- that
China has become a predator state.]{.underline} Rand's Michael Mazarr
wrote about predator states in the late 1990s. He argues that [what
distinguishes a predator state above all is "territorial aggression" --
the predisposition to grab territory and resources.]{.underline} China
is one of two contemporary examples[; the other is Russia in
Europe]{.underline}. The best historical examples are Napoleonic France,
Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, and more recently Iraq under Saddam
Hussein. These examples teach us that [predator states cause
wars]{.underline}. [Predator states are buoyed by an expansionist
ideology -- the active promotion of the idea that neighbouring
territories (both land and maritime) belong by rights to the
predator]{.underline}. [Such states often possess a sense of historical
grievance or victimization that can only be "righted" by territorial
grabs]{.underline}. Indeed, a Mazarr contends, the "politics of memory
operates powerfully...causing \[predator states\] to react by forming
aggressive, predatory instincts." Besides territorial aggression,
[predator states exhibit several other distinguishing features.
First,]{.underline} [national policy demonstrates very high levels of
militarization. Predator states divert large quantities of national
resources into military expansion for purposes of power projection. The
emphasis in military planning and weapons acquisitions is inherently
offensive rather than defensive and is geared to intimidating potential
adversaries and winning offensive wars.]{.underline} The flipside
domestically is, as Mazarr writes, that "military, nationalistic, and
territorial issues continue to play a large role in domestic politics
and in the states' approach to the world." [In China's case, nationalism
has overtaken Marxism and more recently developmentalism as state
ideology. Second,]{.underline} [predator states adopt a strongly
strategic perspective on national advancement and display an associated
willingness to use all the institutions and instruments of the state
over which they maintain control]{.underline} -- economic, cultural,
military, technological, resource, trade, legal, media -- in the pursuit
of this overwhelming important strategic objective. China, for example,
deployed a broad range of retaliatory instruments against Japan over the
Senkaku Islands affair in 2010, including restricting the export of rare
earth metals. The use of such "strategic" instruments extends beyond
such punitive acts of state retaliation to a whole range of long-term,
so-called "market-based" investments. These include foreign acquisitions
in strategically important and sensitive areas such as land, resource
and water assets and critical infrastructure as well as in
private-sector developments and industries. The "strategic" element
cannot be discounted in these acquisitions because the line between
private enterprise and state-owned enterprises in the Chinese case is
imprecise given the complex interweaving of business and state actors.
In the end, everything becomes "strategic" in the sense of supporting
national advancement and security. [Third,]{.underline} [predator states
are not democracies where there exist checks and balances and other
moderating influences that negate the potential for predation against
other states. Predator states have authoritarian governments with low
levels of accountability.]{.underline} Political leaders are only
answerable to other power cliques and display a willingness to engage in
political repression, including imprisonment and even murder of their
opponents. In such states, there is no real separation of the executive
from the judiciary and, in that sense, no rule of law. Levels of
domestic lawlessness are matched by international lawlessness. Predator
states do not respond to appeals to international laws or norms because
they are inherently lawless themselves -- they understand and respect
only power in international affairs. China's actions in the South China
Sea clearly demonstrate that it does not support a rules-based regional
or global order; nor does it believe that you can fight power with rules
as other states are attempting to do in dealing with this issue.
[Finally, predator states show a predisposition to act unilaterally
rather than multilaterally. Multilateral cooperation is entertained only
where it fits with the long-term strategic interests of the state.
Moreover, there is little willingness to trade off state interests for
larger collective interests in the international community. In that
sense, predator states are not interested in providing international
public goods and should not be considered as potentially benign
hegemons. How should other states deal effectively with predator states?
First of all, they need to recognize what they are dealing with and
react accordingly. Predator states demand tough responses starting with
vigilance, deterrence and containment. At the very least there must be
reinforcement of surveillance regimes, the formation of counterbalancing
coalitions, and a willingness to act across a whole range of spheres --
military, economic, financial, trade and diplomatic -- so that predator
states' actions are not cost-free. Other states must also accept that
doing nothing is not an option. This only invites further provocation,
which increases the risk of serious conflict.]{.underline}

### Heg good

**US Heg is good.**

First, **[[the possession of international primacy has benefitted the
United States greatly]{.mark} ]{.underline}**over the
years, **[[allowing it to fashion a generally advantageous world
order.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Second, and contrary to what is often
argued today, [this era of American primacy is not yet
over]{.underline}, nor will it end anytime soon---the United States
still has a commanding lead in the most important dimensions of global
power. Third, however[, if American primacy still remains intact, that
primacy is nonetheless growing more contested today ]{.underline}than at
any previous time during the post-Cold War era. And fourth, although it
would be [**[unwise for the United States to retrench dramatically from
its globe-straddling posture, America will need to make greater
investments, and greater efforts, to sustain its eminently favorable
global position]{.mark} **in the years to come.** **]{.underline}Let's
start with the first point---[that primacy has been very good for the
United States]{.underline}. [America has enjoyed some degree of
international primacy since World War II,]{.underline} and
an [essentially unrivaled sort of primacy since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}. And over the course of several decades, Washington has
used that [primacy to shape an international system that]{.underline},
by any meaningful comparison[, has been highly conducive to American
interests and ideals. **[Washington has employed its power to uphold
stability in key regions, to foster the spread of democracy and human
rights, to anchor a prosperous and liberal global economy, and to
contain or roll back the influence of aggressive authoritarian powers or
other malign actors that might fundamentally disrupt this more or less
happy state of affairs]{.mark}**.** **]{.underline}To be sure, the
temptations of power have occasionally gotten the better of Americans,
leading to military interventions or other exertions that have proven
counterproductive in the end---Vietnam and Iraq being the two foremost
examples. But on the whole, [the United States has profited handsomely
from its primacy, using it to shape a fairly congenial global
order]{.underline}. Moreover---and this is the second key
point---[reports of American primacy's demise are much
exaggerated]{.underline}, just as they have been in previous instance of
premature "declinism" over the past seventy years. For by the most
important metrics, the United States still boasts sizable leads over its
closest geopolitical competitors. Consider the economic balance. In
2014, [America had a \$17.5 trillion GDP]{.underline} that was more than
\$7 trillion larger than China's. It's per capita GDP---which is a key
measure of how much wealth a country can actually extract from its
citizenry to pursue ambitious international objectives---was around four
times as large as China's. If one considers more holistic measures like
"inclusive wealth," which takes into account factors such as China's
catastrophic degradation of its environment, then the U.S. lead becomes
even larger. Add in all of the long-term economic problems that a
country like China faces, and confident predictions of impending Chinese
economic supremacy seem increasingly tenuous. In the military realm,
U.[S. global primacy is even more pronounced.]{.underline} U.S. [defense
spending remained around three times as high as China's]{.underline} as
of 2014, meaning that the absolute American lead in overall military
investment and capabilities is actually getting substantially larger
each year. [The U.S. military also has global power-projection
capabilities that won't be matched for decades]{.underline}, if even
then; it has vast amounts of recent experience in complex operations; it
possesses extraordinarily high levels of human capital, married to the
flexible command-and-control structures needed to make the most of that
capital. And, of course, the United States has literally dozens of
allies that add significantly to the aggregate power of the community
that Washington leads; challengers like Russia and China have a very
small number of allies that are often more liabilities than assets. As
Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth have therefore concluded in a
recent study of global power dynamics, "Everyone should start getting
used to a world in which the United States remains the sole superpower
for decades to come." Yet this leads to a third key point about American
power---that although it is highly premature to say that the era of U.S.
primacy has passed, [it is not premature to observe that this primacy is
being tested and stressed more strenuously than at any time since the
Cold War.The challenges that the United States faces to its primacy
today are arguably more serious than they have been at any time in a
quarter-century; they are certainly more numerous than at any previous
point during this period. ]{.underline}Undoubtedly sitting atop the list
of those challenges is the return of [great-power
competition]{.underline}. **[[Major regional powers like Russia and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**---which never really accepted a post-Cold
War order dominated by the United States---are now [[**using their power
and capabilities to push back against that
order**.]{.mark}** **They]{.underline} are seeking to dominate their
"near abroads"; they are testing American alliances along the periphery
of U.S. power. Indeed, notwithstanding the fact that U.S. global
military primacy remains intact, these countries are developing and
deploying capabilities that [**[increasingly menace America's ability to
project that power into East Asia and Eastern Europe.Regional military
balances are therefore shifting in adverse ways, confronting the United
States with military and geopolitical challenges unlike any it has faced
since the end of the Cold War]{.mark}**.** **]{.underline}American
primacy is being tested in other ways, as well. The "end of history" has
now ended---the world ideological climate is becoming more contested as
the spread of democracy has stalled, and authoritarianism seems to be
making a modest comeback. The exploits of the Islamic State, which has
utterly destabilized a key region, and North Korea, which is reportedly
working toward an ICBM capability to complement its growing nuclear
arsenal, demonstrate that the challenge posed by "rogue" actors is
probably greater than at any time since Saddam Hussein's defeat in the
Persian Gulf War in 1991. U.S. allies have become relatively weaker in
terms of their shares of global GDP and defense spending over the past
fifteen years; the European allies have systematically divested
themselves of many key military capabilities. And within the United
States, partisan gridlock and polarization have played havoc with the
Pentagon's force structure, modernization programs, and readiness over
the past half-decade, amid broader questions about whether Americans
care to sustain an ambitious global project any longer. It is still not
time to panic about the state of American primacy, then, but there is
real cause for concern. So what is America to do? Advocates of restraint
often argue that Washington should roll back many of the alliance
commitments and forward deployments that have long characterized U.S.
strategy, and fall back to a far more austere international posture. Yet
as discussed previously, [this position overstates the degree of
American relative decline,]{.underline} for America's primacy has not
yet eroded to the point where it lacks options other than dramatic
retrenchment. Moreover, as I have argued elsewhere at greater length,
proposals for "offshore balancing" or other retrenchment-minded
strategies rest on highly precarious assumptions about whether the world
would remain stable and congenial following a major geopolitical
retreat. In other words, if you think that the world seems dangerous and
unstable now, just wait and see what it looks like without U.S.
engagement and presence as we have known it for the past seventy years.
What is true enough, however, is [that Washington will undoubtedly have
to work harder]{.underline}---and [invest more]{.underline}---[to
maintain an acceptable degree of primacy]{.underline}, and the benefits
it has long provided. During the post--Cold War era, [America has
essentially been able to enjoy primacy on the cheap]{.underline}. It has
spent as little as 3 percent of GDP on defense during this period, while
also deferring hard choices about deficits, ballooning domestic
spending, and other critical long-term fiscal issues. [There will be no
such luxury in the coming years.]{.underline}

#### US Heg good for free society

**Fay '17** [(Matthew Fay is Director of Defense and Foreign Policy
Studies at the Niskanen Center, \"America Unrestrained?: Engagement,
Retrenchment, and Libertarian Foreign Policy\", November 16th,
2017, [[https://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/America-Unrestrained.pdf)]{.underline}](https://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/America-Unrestrained.pdf))]{.mark}

While libertarians often disagree with one another, there is broad
agreement among them about the need to change American foreign policy.
They believe the United States should pursue a political military
retrenchment by forswearing intervention in the affairs of other states
and exiting the alliances it has formed since 1945. By doing so,
libertarians believe the United States will be at war less and a free
society will flourish as a result. The size of its military would
shrink, they argue, which would in turn reduce the financial burden it
places on American taxpayers and the threat the national security state
poses to individual liberty. However, using retrenchment as the basis
for a libertarian foreign policy is unlikely to serve libertarian ends.
Retrenchment ignores the relationship between the international
political environment and domestic political order. At the same time,
libertarian advocates for retrenchment have overestimated the benefits
it will provide for a free society, while overlooking the risks it
presents. Instead, libertarians should **[embrace a grand strategy of
engagement that maintains America's core military alliances while
pursuing reforms that will constrain American leaders' tendency to use
military force recklessly]{.underline}**. One of the many remarkable
features of the 2016 presidential campaign was the number of
libertarians who found hope in Donald Trump's "America First" foreign
policy. To be sure, the overwhelming majority of libertarians found
Trump's candidacy, and subsequent election, grotesque. However, a number
of libertarians saw in America First---with its supposed repudiation of
nation building and overt hostility to America's allies---a foreign
policy they could rally behind. Some of these individuals operate at the
fringes of the libertarian movement, but even some mainstream
libertarian voices had positive things to say about Trump as he
belatedly criticized the invasion of Iraq and hinted that he might pull
out of NATO.1 Several libertarian supporters of Trump's foreign policy
have expressed "buyer's remorse" as he launched cruise missiles against
Assad regime forces in Syria, escalated the bombing campaign against the
Islamic State, ramped up counterterrorism operations in Yemen and
elsewhere, promised to rain "fire and fury" on North Korea, increased
the number of American troops in Afghanistan, and refused to certify
that Iran was in compliance with the deal to curb its nuclear program.2
But as a candidate, Trump never really hid what he was selling. On the
campaign trail, Trump not only rejected core libertarian principles such
as the free movement of goods and people, but also said, "I really love
war, in a certain way," promised to torture terrorism suspects and go
after their families, and repeatedly stated his desire to "take" Iraqi
oil.3 That any supporter of a free society would back a candidate
expressing such sentiments is puzzling. A partial explanation for the
initial sympathy among some libertarians for Trump's foreign policy can
be found with his opponent. Hillary Clinton, throughout her career, has
been a consistently hawkish interventionist.4 That explanation is
incomplete, though. While libertarian support for America First was
limited, it represented a broader problem in libertarian foreign policy
thinking. Libertarianism is perhaps most famous for the internal
disagreements of its adherents. However, one broad area of agreement
among American libertarians is that the United States needs to be less
involved in the world. While libertarians want diplomatic and commercial
relations with the world, they believe the American government should
have little political or military attachment to other countries and
should avoid meddling in their internal affairs. George Washington's
warning against "foreign entanglements," Thomas Jefferson's call for
"peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations; entangling
alliances with none," and John Quincy Adams' axiom that America "goes
not abroad in search of monsters to destroy" combine to form the
lodestar of libertarian foreign policy.5 As a matter of policy,
libertarians generally believe the United States should undertake a
political and military retrenchment.6 Libertarians think that by pulling
back from overseas commitments and forgoing intervention in the internal
affairs of other countries, the United States would become involved in
fewer wars.7 [War is inherently destructive to human life and property,
and disruptive to peaceful exchange and cooperation. It infringes on the
rights of individuals abroad.]{.underline} At home, [war poses a threat
to a free society. The size of the state increases during wartime, as
does its propensity to act oppressively]{.underline}. Yet despite
Trump's professed militarism, some libertarians saw the type of
disengagement they had long sought in his America First platform. Even
if Trump had been the type of non-interventionist some mistakenly
believed he was, **[retrenchment may not produce]{.underline}** the
**[free society]{.underline}** at home that libertarians desire.
**[Remaining aloof from international politics risks the return of a
more competitive and war-prone international system. On close
examination, the benefits of retrenchment do not outweigh the risks of a
more conflict-ridden world.]{.underline}** If peace is a prerequisite of
a free society, then a **[free society is more likely if the United
States remains engaged in the world.]{.underline}** This paper argues
that a grand strategy of engagement serves libertarian foreign policy
ends better than retrenchment.8 At the same time, libertarians should
continue pursuing reforms that inhibit American leaders' tendency to use
military force recklessly. The paper proceeds in four parts. The first
part discusses the relationship between international order and a free
society before explaining how a grand strategy of engagement helps
enable an international environment conducive to the latter. The second
part discusses the strongest argument libertarian foreign policy
analysts have made for retrenchment: a grand strategy derived from
realist international relations known as "restraint." The third part
explains why the benefits of retrenchment are marginal while the risks
are high by exploring alternative scenarios that could occur if the
United States retrenches. The fourth part explores the policy
implications of a grand strategy of engagement for libertarians.
Engagement and a Free Society Foreign policy presents a dilemma for
libertarians. In modern history, **[the state has been the primary actor
in international politics]{.underline}**. Libertarians are suspicious of
an overweening state because it poses a threat to a free society.
Libertarians therefore adopt an a priori non-interventionist position
according to which the use of military force should be prohibited except
in cases of national self-defense. This section explains why this
**[focus on narrow self-defense is misguided.]{.underline}** First, it
explores the relationship between the international order and a state's
political order. Second, it discusses the concept of grand strategy and
how [a grand strategy of engagement through a system of alliances
facilitates an international order conducive to a free
society.]{.underline} International Politics and a Free Society If the
United States adopted a narrow focus on its self-defense, it likely
would remain physically secure. Given its geographic isolation, America
is largely immune to major military threats. Therefore, if the United
States focuses narrowly on its own security, it will have few reasons to
go to war. Retrenchment might therefore allow the United States to
remain aloof from international politics and forgo alliances, obviating
the need to maintain a large military and thereby avoiding the taxation,
bureaucracy, and state growth that accompany large military
establishments. However, a libertarian foreign policy narrowly focused
on territorial defense is misguided for at least two reasons. First,
"security" is an ambiguous, and often subjective, basis for determining
America's national interest. Second, a narrow focus on physical security
ignores the way an increasingly competitive international system might
affect the internal character of the American state. The physical
security of a state is obviously necessary, but it is an insufficient
basis for identifying the national interest because security is an
inherently ambiguous concept. References to national security, as
political scientist Arnold Wolfers argued in 1952, are rhetorically
powerful but have little intrinsic meaning.9 The invocation of national
security is just as symbolic when it's used to sell retrenchment as it
is when inflating threats for the purpose of hawkish policies. A state
defines its security based on its interests, and its interests are a
product of its values. Historian Melvyn Leffler, in the course of
developing an explanatory framework for studying the history of American
foreign relations, has argued that America's national interest must be
viewed through its "core values." Instead of focusing on narrow
self-defense, Leffler argues, "Core values usually fuse material
self-interest with more fundamental goals like the defense of a state's
organizing ideology, such as liberal capitalism, the protection of its
political institutions, and the safeguarding of its physical base or
territorial integrity."10 Leffler later warned that throughout American
history, imbalances between ideology and a rational understanding of
America's national interest have led to foreign policy disasters. Too
much of the latter leads to heightened threat perceptions, which have in
turn resulted in the misuse of American power abroad.11 However, he
rightly notes that narrow physical security, the internal political
character, and ideological concerns are inextricably tied together when
considering America's interests. If America's values include, for
libertarians, the maintenance of a free society, then it is important to
consider how the external environment of a state affects its internal
character. International pressures help shape the internal character of
states.12 The two are, in fact, intertwined. International order and
domestic political order both serve the purpose of providing security
against organized violence.13 How that order is achieved on both the
international and domestic levels has important implications for both
the likelihood of war and the internal character of a state. Liberal
polities in particular have been interested in the connection between
international order and domestic political order. Political scientist
Daniel Deudney argues that liberal states attempt to shape their
international environment to mitigate anarchy at the international
level. To do so, liberal states practice what Deudney refers to as
"security co-binding." **[Security co-binding is an effort to lock
states into mutually constraining institutions to mitigate the threat
they pose to one another in an anarchic international
system]{.underline}**.14 In t**[he absence of these institutions, states
are likely to balance against the potential threats they pose to one
another by building up their military capabilities. The result of these
military buildups would be rampant security dilemmas. Security dilemmas
occur when defensive measures in one state create a sense of insecurity
in another, producing a response that reduces the security of the first
state, leading to further defensive measures, and so on.15 Security
dilemmas tend to produce arms races and]{.underline}** occasionally
**[spiral into war]{.underline}**.16 In modern Europe, wars that
resulted from these security dilemmas led to recurring cycles of state
building.17

Robert Kaplan, one of the world's foremost experts on China, has stated
"[The South China Sea will be the 21st Century's defining
battleground]{.underline}." The obsession with supremacy in the South
China Sea is certainly not a new phenomenon in the realms of
international security and maritime strategy. In opinionated discussions
related to naval warfare, prominent political scientists and military
strategists have been addressing the geopolitical and military
significance of the region for decades. For example, the enlightening
1997 article "The Chinese Way", written in the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists by Professor Chalmers Johnson of the University of
California-San Diego, noted significantly increased defense budgets and
expenditures in the region. In addition, the article eludes to the fact
that [China had claimed the entire South China Sea and would use its
naval forces to counter any encroachment. The argument for an increased
U.S. naval presence in East Asia is certainly not without precedent.
This contested aquatic region has tremendous geopolitical, strategic and
economic significance. While, the Persian Gulf has immense importance
and global recognition due to its strategic location in the Middle East,
as well its significance to global commerce, industry and sought after
oil, the South China Sea is crucially important to nations seeking to
obtain their economic riches and geopolitical advantages.]{.underline}
The South China Sea is geographically located near the Pacific Ocean and
encompasses an area of 1.4 million square miles (3.5 million square
kilometers). As a semi-closed area, the South China Sea extends from the
Singapore Strait to the Taiwan Strait, with China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Brunei, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan surrounding it. In terms of
economic value, [fishery stocks and potential fossil fuel reserves are
two major commodities that may spark an armed conflict, even to the
point of nuclear confrontation.]{.underline} As a rich source of the
region's staple diet, fish, the sea guarantees a steady flow of food to
the countries of the region. Control and supremacy of the sea would also
assure claiming the much touted hydrocarbon reserves in the seabed,
possibly exceeding those of the OPEC nations such as Iraq and Kuwait.
The conquest of this vast resource would virtually assure energy
independence and high monetary returns for those that would gain
supremacy over the South China Sea. [Thus, seizing the opportunity to
gain dominance will lead to control and manipulation of vital food and
energy resources, economic wealth and geopolitical power in the
region.]{.underline} A scenario of regional and maritime domination and
control could lead to the partial or total exclusion of adjacent
nation-states to access any food or natural resources derived from a sea
ruled with an iron hand; leading to a massive complex humanitarian
catastrophe of immense proportions from malnutrition and starvation,
limitations in energy production, and economic collapse. These factors
make the South China Sea a national security priority for nations in the
region, including one of the world's superpowers, China. The dependence
of China and other regional nations surrounding the South China Sea on
the Strait of Malacca is analogous in geopolitical and economic terms,
to the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Approximately one -third of
all global trade funnels through the strait and also serves as a conduit
for raw materials and energy needs for China and other adjacent
nation-states. Such potential dominance in any region, leads to a
high-stakes game of brinkmanship, and at least the possibility of a
regional war which could conceivably escalate to engulf nation-states
external to the regional sphere. Tensions and skirmishes have the
propensity to evolve into armed conflict and full-scale war, and
apprehensive leaders and military planners in such a contested region
serve as the facilitators for disaster. [China continues to assert
sovereignty by constructing man made islands using sand dredged from the
sea bottom and these artificial islands could be militarized. China has
even affirmed its desire to have a military presence on these islands;
however, the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also professes the use of
these land masses to facilitate commerce via shipping lanes and to
protect Chinese fishing and other vessels from piracy. China will never
cease its quest for supremacy and its perceived "ownership" of the South
China Sea]{.underline}, as the legitimacy and structure of the Chinese
government is based on nationalism and achievement of the "Chinese
Dream". The Chinese regime continues to vehemently assert their
perceived "right" to the South China Sea, and it forges ahead with plans
and operations that could lead to naval warfare and conflict escalation.
The knowledge that China possesses formidable naval capacity and
capabilities, including nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarines,
is, indeed, disconcerting at the very least. As we examine and evaluate
the "submarine factor", it is evident that China's submarines have no
practical value in its disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines.
Essentially, nuclear ballistic missile capable submarines serve as a
deterrent against thermonuclear war[. Without doubt, the primary reason
that China possesses nuclear-capable submarines is to deter an American
attack, although India's nuclear weapons are also a consideration for
Beijing. Nuclear capable submarines are capable of deep dive
capabilities and shorter launch to target times. While China's submarine
capabilities may appear worrisome to some, sudden deployment from port
in a geopolitical crisis would serve as a critical indicator to the US
and Western allies, and its submarine fleet still remains somewhat noisy
and detectable. China has already demonstrated its aggression at sea in
several instances, such as the ramming and sinking of a Vietnamese
fishing boat in disputed waters claimed by both countries in the region
and an ominous presence and military mobilization exercises which have
been monitored by military and intelligence assets.]{.underline} A
report by the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, indicates that
Chinese SSBNs are able to target portions of the U.S. from strategic
operational positions near the Chinese coast. China's Global Times
published an unprecedented report that revealed a nuclear missile strike
on the western U.S. with JL-2 missiles could generate up to 12 million
American fatalities. The Obama administration and senior U.S. naval
officials have not retorted [to China's claims of a potentially
devastating nuclear threat, which included graphics showing radiological
plumes and collateral damage induced by radiation. The possibilities of
China's anti-satellite strategies to disable communications and
intelligence-gathering capabilities must also be taken
seriously.]{.underline} Most assuredly, the South China Sea would serve
as an obvious arena for the projection of Chinese power, including
conventional and, potentially, nuclear scenarios. China's South Sea
naval facilities have seen significant upgrading and expansion, such as
the facilities on Hainan, and the nuclear submarine base at Longpo
serves as the first nuclear submarine base in the South China Sea. The
base also includes a submarine tunnel that is part of an underwater
complex of nuclear facilities on Hainan. Also, [Chinese-Russian wargames
are worrisome, which adds to the concerns of nuclear confrontation and
consequences globally. The Chinese have asserted their right to defend
its territories, which in their view, includes the South China Sea, and
they have stated verbally, and by their aggressive actions, that they
will continue to pursue their strategic goals despite the threat of
confrontation and conflict.]{.underline} Many of the issues in
contention in the South China Sea will remain unresolved for, probably,
several years to come. We must remain balanced, and not overzealous in
our approaches to assisting with conflict resolution in the area. We
must apply reasonable diplomacy, without stirring up a hornet's nest
that would serve to be counterproductive and enhance animosities.
However, the US, its allies, and other concerned nation-states must not
refrain from being ever so vigilant and proactive in achieving peaceful
resolution, while at the same time maintaining our national defense and
security postures.

#### Sustaining heg is key

School of Public Policy at Duke University. His most recent book is What
Good is Grand Strategy? Power and Purpose in American Statecraft from
Harry S. Truman to George W. Bush, just released by Cornell University
Press, 2017, "The Gathering Storm vs. the Crisis of Confidence"
http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/14/the-gathering-storm-vs-the-crisis-of-confidence-trump-1930s-1970s/)

[In]{.underline} many ways, this was an accurate reflection of the
national mood at the end of [the]{.underline} 19[70s]{.underline}.
During that decade, [the **U**nited **S**tates faced a raft of serious
challenges]{.underline} --- severe economic competition from other
leading powers, the rise of the Soviet Union as a global peer competitor
in military terms, the stagflation and national humiliation caused by
the oil shocks. [There were concerns that the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [was turning inward]{.underline} [in the wake
of Vietnam, as leading congressional observers even sought to withdraw
significant numbers of U.S. troops from Europe]{.underline}. Economic
nationalism was on the rise. Richard Nixon's first treasury secretary,
John Connally, artfully expressed the ethos: "Foreigners are out to
screw us. Our job is to screw them first." In these circumstances,
[doubts about the staying power of the United States and the postwar
international system were pervasive. Defenders of that system fretted
that the American era was coming to a close;]{.underline} enemies of the
free world were often exultant. "The retreat of American power" could
"become a rout," James Schlesinger, the former secretary of defense and
secretary of energy, wrote in 1979. "The trend could well become
irreversible in many respects." "Imperialism is not able to face the
crises," Leonid Brezhnev had told Warsaw Pact leaders the year prior.
**[And yet the 1970s proved not to be the death knell for American
power]{.underline}** and the free world system erected after World War
II, [but simply a difficult moment that served as prelude to renewal. By
the late 1970s, the world was again turning in America's direction ---
democracy was spreading, globalization was racing ahead, America's
primary great-power competitor was sliding into irreversible
decline]{.underline}. And by the early 1980s the United States was
pursuing assertive and broadly effective strategies for re-establishing
its global ascendancy and pushing the positive trends along. Within a
decade, the Cold War had ended on American terms, as democracy and
markets were advancing --- with U.S. assistance --- further than ever
before. If focusing on the 1930s analogy thus leads one to fear that the
end of the international order is nigh, looking at the 1970s encourages
the conclusion that perhaps the future is relatively bright after all.
In this view, the United States and the international system it anchors
still have tremendous and unmatched strengths vis-à-vis the competition,
the long-term trends are working in Washington's favor, and [America is
simply experiencing one of its periodic moments of doubt and
introspection rather than a more **fundamental turn** away from
internationalism]{.underline} --- just as occurred during the 1970s. So
how well does this analogy fit? In some ways, emphasizing the 1970s
comparison risks understating the difficulties and challenges America
faces today. For all the disillusion occasioned by Vietnam, America did
not elect a president who repudiated key traditions of U.S. foreign
policy as vehemently and frequently as Donald Trump did during the 2016
campaign. American "soft power" took a beating amid the domestic
upheaval of the 1970s, but that weakness may ultimately prove to be
minor compared with the loss of prestige the United States is already
suffering as a result of Trump's presidency. From a global perspective,
the Soviet Union may have been an authentic military peer rival during
the 1970s, but even at its peak its sclerotic, command economy never
threatened U.S. economic primacy as China does today. And in the 1970s,
the United States was able deftly to play China and the Soviet Union
against each other; today, Washington has fraught and deteriorating
relations with both powers as they challenge international norms and
geopolitical arrangements to which they were never genuinely reconciled.
The 1970s were a difficult period, no doubt, but the comparison may ---
at least in some ways --- encourage too rosy a view of what America
confronts today. Yet if the 1970s are far from the perfect analogy, the
period does nonetheless illuminate important aspects of the contemporary
moment. It reminds us that, today as in the past, America's competitors
face long-term challenges that make ours look relatively modest by
comparison. Russia is, after all, a declining economic power and a
demographic basket case; its military power thus rests on extremely
precarious foundations. China is already dealing with slowing economic
growth, a rapidly aging population, and a massive debt bubble, and its
sense of geopolitical self-confidence hardly conceals its leadership's
transparent nervousness about growing social unrest and other signs of
dissatisfaction with a corrupt and ruthlessly authoritarian political
system. Similarly, [the 1970s analogy reminds us to take into account
long-range U.S. strengths that no adversary can match and to factor in
emerging trends that may play to America's advantage.]{.underline}
[Washington's]{.underline} unequaled collection of allies, its
relatively healthy demographic profile, its [culture of
innovation]{.underline}, and its repeated resilience in the face of
macroeconomic shifts falls into the first category; an energy revolution
that is giving America new [economic and geopolitical leverage is but
one example of the second.]{.underline} Moreover, the experience of the
1970s underscores that assertive challengers often overplay their hand,
thereby risking overreach and exposing vulnerabilities for the United
States and its allies to exploit. An overconfident Moscow took on
numerous Third World commitments during the 1970s, allowing Carter and
then Reagan to punish that overextension through support to
anti-communist guerrillas. Should Russia and China continue their
revisionist behavior today, they are similarly likely to encourage
geopolitical blowback, if only by driving their rivals toward closer
cooperation with one another and with the United States. Additionally,
[we can learn from the 1970s that our current traumas are neither
unprecedented nor particularly severe by historical standards. In its
effects on U.S. political stability and American power, the Vietnam War
was far worse than anything the country has experienced in Iraq or
Afghanistan over the past 15 years.]{.underline} Finally, [the
experience of the 1970s also cautions us not to panic about the state of
American internationalism. Yes, the Trump phenomenon is **deeply
disturbing** for those who wish to see a globally engaged America
contributing constructively on issues including international trade and
combating climate change. But we have lived through periods of American
disillusion]{.underline} [with the world before, as the experience of
the 1970s reminds us, and the logic of global engagement and activism
has generally reasserted itself after a fashion]{.underline} ---
[usually in response to threatening developments abroad. Indeed, the
fact that public opinion polling on support for U.S. alliances and
honoring America's overseas commitments actually looked much worse in
the mid-1970s than it does at present]{.underline} (after the U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam, for instance, only 36 percent of Americans felt
that "it was important for the United States to make and keep
commitments to other nations") [provides some antidote to pessimism
today]{.underline}.

#### Hegemony allows the creation of a peaceful world order, also solves war

**Brands '16** (Hal Brands is an Assistant Professor in the Sanford
School of Public Policy at Duke University. His most recent book is What
Good is Grand Strategy? Power and Purpose in American Statecraft from
Harry S. Truman to George W. Bush, just released by Cornell University

First, **[[the possession of international primacy has benefitted the
United States greatly]{.mark} ]{.underline}**over the
years, **[[allowing it to fashion a generally advantageous world
order.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Second, and contrary to what is often
argued today, [this era of American primacy is not yet
over]{.underline}, nor will it end anytime soon---the United States
still has a commanding lead in the most important dimensions of global
power. Third, however[, if American primacy still remains intact, that
primacy is nonetheless growing more contested today ]{.underline}than at
any previous time during the post-Cold War era. And fourth, although it
would be [**[unwise for the United States to retrench dramatically from
its globe-straddling posture, America will need to make greater
investments, and greater efforts, to sustain its eminently favorable
global position]{.mark} **in the years to come.** **]{.underline}Let's
start with the first point---[that primacy has been very good for the
United States]{.underline}. [America has enjoyed some degree of
international primacy since World War II,]{.underline} and
an [essentially unrivaled sort of primacy since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}. And over the course of several decades, Washington has
used that [primacy to shape an international system that]{.underline},
by any meaningful comparison[, has been highly conducive to American
interests and ideals. **[Washington has employed its power to uphold
stability in key regions, to foster the spread of democracy and human
rights, to anchor a prosperous and liberal global economy, and to
contain or roll back the influence of aggressive authoritarian powers or
other malign actors that might fundamentally disrupt this more or less
happy state of affairs]{.mark}**.** **]{.underline}To be sure, the
temptations of power have occasionally gotten the better of Americans,
leading to military interventions or other exertions that have proven
counterproductive in the end---Vietnam and Iraq being the two foremost
examples. But on the whole, [the United States has profited handsomely
from its primacy, using it to shape a fairly congenial global
order]{.underline}. Moreover---and this is the second key
point---[reports of American primacy's demise are much
exaggerated]{.underline}, just as they have been in previous instance of
premature "declinism" over the past seventy years. For by the most
important metrics, the United States still boasts sizable leads over its
closest geopolitical competitors. Consider the economic balance. In
2014, [America had a \$17.5 trillion GDP]{.underline} that was more than
\$7 trillion larger than China's. It's per capita GDP---which is a key
measure of how much wealth a country can actually extract from its
citizenry to pursue ambitious international objectives---was around four
times as large as China's. If one considers more holistic measures like
"inclusive wealth," which takes into account factors such as China's
catastrophic degradation of its environment, then the U.S. lead becomes
even larger. Add in all of the long-term economic problems that a
country like China faces, and confident predictions of impending Chinese
economic supremacy seem increasingly tenuous. In the military realm,
U.[S. global primacy is even more pronounced.]{.underline} U.S. [defense
spending remained around three times as high as China's]{.underline} as
of 2014, meaning that the absolute American lead in overall military
investment and capabilities is actually getting substantially larger
each year. [The U.S. military also has global power-projection
capabilities that won't be matched for decades]{.underline}, if even
then; it has vast amounts of recent experience in complex operations; it
possesses extraordinarily high levels of human capital, married to the
flexible command-and-control structures needed to make the most of that
capital. And, of course, the United States has literally dozens of
allies that add significantly to the aggregate power of the community
that Washington leads; challengers like Russia and China have a very
small number of allies that are often more liabilities than assets. As
Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth have therefore concluded in a
recent study of global power dynamics, "Everyone should start getting
used to a world in which the United States remains the sole superpower
for decades to come." Yet this leads to a third key point about American
power---that although it is highly premature to say that the era of U.S.
primacy has passed, [it is not premature to observe that this primacy is
being tested and stressed more strenuously than at any time since the
Cold War.The challenges that the United States faces to its primacy
today are arguably more serious than they have been at any time in a
quarter-century; they are certainly more numerous than at any previous
point during this period. ]{.underline}Undoubtedly sitting atop the list
of those challenges is the return of [great-power
competition]{.underline}. **[[Major regional powers like Russia and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**---which never really accepted a post-Cold
War order dominated by the United States---are now [[**using their power
and capabilities to push back against that
order**.]{.mark}** **They]{.underline} are seeking to dominate their
"near abroads"; they are testing American alliances along the periphery
of U.S. power. Indeed, notwithstanding the fact that U.S. global
military primacy remains intact, these countries are developing and
deploying capabilities that [**[increasingly menace America's ability to
project that power into East Asia and Eastern Europe.Regional military
balances are therefore shifting in adverse ways, confronting the United
States with military and geopolitical challenges unlike any it has faced
since the end of the Cold War]{.mark}**.** **]{.underline}American
primacy is being tested in other ways, as well. The "end of history" has
now ended---the world ideological climate is becoming more contested as
the spread of democracy has stalled, and authoritarianism seems to be
making a modest comeback. The exploits of the Islamic State, which has
utterly destabilized a key region, and North Korea, which is reportedly
working toward an ICBM capability to complement its growing nuclear
arsenal, demonstrate that the challenge posed by "rogue" actors is
probably greater than at any time since Saddam Hussein's defeat in the
Persian Gulf War in 1991. U.S. allies have become relatively weaker in
terms of their shares of global GDP and defense spending over the past
fifteen years; the European allies have systematically divested
themselves of many key military capabilities. And within the United
States, partisan gridlock and polarization have played havoc with the
Pentagon's force structure, modernization programs, and readiness over
the past half-decade, amid broader questions about whether Americans
care to sustain an ambitious global project any longer. It is still not
time to panic about the state of American primacy, then, but there is
real cause for concern. So what is America to do? Advocates of restraint
often argue that Washington should roll back many of the alliance
commitments and forward deployments that have long characterized U.S.
strategy, and fall back to a far more austere international posture. Yet
as discussed previously, [this position overstates the degree of
American relative decline,]{.underline} for America's primacy has not
yet eroded to the point where it lacks options other than dramatic
retrenchment. Moreover, as I have argued elsewhere at greater length,
proposals for "offshore balancing" or other retrenchment-minded
strategies rest on highly precarious assumptions about whether the world
would remain stable and congenial following a major geopolitical
retreat. In other words, if you think that the world seems dangerous and
unstable now, just wait and see what it looks like without U.S.
engagement and presence as we have known it for the past seventy years.
What is true enough, however, is [that Washington will undoubtedly have
to work harder]{.underline}---and [invest more]{.underline}---[to
maintain an acceptable degree of primacy]{.underline}, and the benefits
it has long provided. During the post--Cold War era, [America has
essentially been able to enjoy primacy on the cheap]{.underline}. It has
spent as little as 3 percent of GDP on defense during this period, while
also deferring hard choices about deficits, ballooning domestic
spending, and other critical long-term fiscal issues. [There will be no
such luxury in the coming years.]{.underline}

**US heg key to stability-without it nations lock themselves into arms
races which leads to war**

**Fay '17** [(Matthew Fay is Director of Defense and Foreign Policy
Studies at the Niskanen Center, \"America Unrestrained?: Engagement,
Retrenchment, and Libertarian Foreign Policy\", November 16th,
2017, <https://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/America-Unrestrained.pdf)>]{.mark}

While libertarians often disagree with one another, there is broad
agreement among them about the need to change American foreign policy.
They believe the United States should pursue a political military
retrenchment by forswearing intervention in the affairs of other states
and exiting the alliances it has formed since 1945. By doing so,
libertarians believe the United States will be at war less and a free
society will flourish as a result. The size of its military would
shrink, they argue, which would in turn reduce the financial burden it
places on American taxpayers and the threat the national security state
poses to individual liberty. However, using retrenchment as the basis
for a libertarian foreign policy is unlikely to serve libertarian ends.
Retrenchment ignores the relationship between the international
political environment and domestic political order. At the same time,
libertarian advocates for retrenchment have overestimated the benefits
it will provide for a free society, while overlooking the risks it
presents. Instead, libertarians should **[embrace a grand strategy of
engagement that maintains America's core military alliances while
pursuing reforms that will constrain American leaders' tendency to use
military force recklessly]{.underline}**. One of the many remarkable
features of the 2016 presidential campaign was the number of
libertarians who found hope in Donald Trump's "America First" foreign
policy. To be sure, the overwhelming majority of libertarians found
Trump's candidacy, and subsequent election, grotesque. However, a number
of libertarians saw in America First---with its supposed repudiation of
nation building and overt hostility to America's allies---a foreign
policy they could rally behind. Some of these individuals operate at the
fringes of the libertarian movement, but even some mainstream
libertarian voices had positive things to say about Trump as he
belatedly criticized the invasion of Iraq and hinted that he might pull
out of NATO.1 Several libertarian supporters of Trump's foreign policy
have expressed "buyer's remorse" as he launched cruise missiles against
Assad regime forces in Syria, escalated the bombing campaign against the
Islamic State, ramped up counterterrorism operations in Yemen and
elsewhere, promised to rain "fire and fury" on North Korea, increased
the number of American troops in Afghanistan, and refused to certify
that Iran was in compliance with the deal to curb its nuclear program.2
But as a candidate, Trump never really hid what he was selling. On the
campaign trail, Trump not only rejected core libertarian principles such
as the free movement of goods and people, but also said, "I really love
war, in a certain way," promised to torture terrorism suspects and go
after their families, and repeatedly stated his desire to "take" Iraqi
oil.3 That any supporter of a free society would back a candidate
expressing such sentiments is puzzling. A partial explanation for the
initial sympathy among some libertarians for Trump's foreign policy can
be found with his opponent. Hillary Clinton, throughout her career, has
been a consistently hawkish interventionist.4 That explanation is
incomplete, though. While libertarian support for America First was
limited, it represented a broader problem in libertarian foreign policy
thinking. Libertarianism is perhaps most famous for the internal
disagreements of its adherents. However, one broad area of agreement
among American libertarians is that the United States needs to be less
involved in the world. While libertarians want diplomatic and commercial
relations with the world, they believe the American government should
have little political or military attachment to other countries and
should avoid meddling in their internal affairs. George Washington's
warning against "foreign entanglements," Thomas Jefferson's call for
"peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations; entangling
alliances with none," and John Quincy Adams' axiom that America "goes
not abroad in search of monsters to destroy" combine to form the
lodestar of libertarian foreign policy.5 As a matter of policy,
libertarians generally believe the United States should undertake a
political and military retrenchment.6 Libertarians think that by pulling
back from overseas commitments and forgoing intervention in the internal
affairs of other countries, the United States would become involved in
fewer wars.7 [War is inherently destructive to human life and property,
and disruptive to peaceful exchange and cooperation. It infringes on the
rights of individuals abroad.]{.underline} At home, [war poses a threat
to a free society. The size of the state increases during wartime, as
does its propensity to act oppressively]{.underline}. Yet despite
Trump's professed militarism, some libertarians saw the type of
disengagement they had long sought in his America First platform. Even
if Trump had been the type of non-interventionist some mistakenly
believed he was, **[retrenchment may not produce]{.underline}** the
**[free society]{.underline}** at home that libertarians desire.
**[Remaining aloof from international politics risks the return of a
more competitive and war-prone international system. On close
examination, the benefits of retrenchment do not outweigh the risks of a
more conflict-ridden world.]{.underline}** If peace is a prerequisite of
a free society, then a **[free society is more likely if the United
States remains engaged in the world.]{.underline}** This paper argues
that a grand strategy of engagement serves libertarian foreign policy
ends better than retrenchment.8 At the same time, libertarians should
continue pursuing reforms that inhibit American leaders' tendency to use
military force recklessly. The paper proceeds in four parts. The first
part discusses the relationship between international order and a free
society before explaining how a grand strategy of engagement helps
enable an international environment conducive to the latter. The second
part discusses the strongest argument libertarian foreign policy
analysts have made for retrenchment: a grand strategy derived from
realist international relations known as "restraint." The third part
explains why the benefits of retrenchment are marginal while the risks
are high by exploring alternative scenarios that could occur if the
United States retrenches. The fourth part explores the policy
implications of a grand strategy of engagement for libertarians.
Engagement and a Free Society Foreign policy presents a dilemma for
libertarians. In modern history, **[the state has been the primary actor
in international politics]{.underline}**. Libertarians are suspicious of
an overweening state because it poses a threat to a free society.
Libertarians therefore adopt an a priori non-interventionist position
according to which the use of military force should be prohibited except
in cases of national self-defense. This section explains why this
**[focus on narrow self-defense is misguided.]{.underline}** First, it
explores the relationship between the international order and a state's
political order. Second, it discusses the concept of grand strategy and
how [a grand strategy of engagement through a system of alliances
facilitates an international order conducive to a free
society.]{.underline} International Politics and a Free Society If the
United States adopted a narrow focus on its self-defense, it likely
would remain physically secure. Given its geographic isolation, America
is largely immune to major military threats. Therefore, if the United
States focuses narrowly on its own security, it will have few reasons to
go to war. Retrenchment might therefore allow the United States to
remain aloof from international politics and forgo alliances, obviating
the need to maintain a large military and thereby avoiding the taxation,
bureaucracy, and state growth that accompany large military
establishments. However, a libertarian foreign policy narrowly focused
on territorial defense is misguided for at least two reasons. First,
"security" is an ambiguous, and often subjective, basis for determining
America's national interest. Second, a narrow focus on physical security
ignores the way an increasingly competitive international system might
affect the internal character of the American state. The physical
security of a state is obviously necessary, but it is an insufficient
basis for identifying the national interest because security is an
inherently ambiguous concept. References to national security, as
political scientist Arnold Wolfers argued in 1952, are rhetorically
powerful but have little intrinsic meaning.9 The invocation of national
security is just as symbolic when it's used to sell retrenchment as it
is when inflating threats for the purpose of hawkish policies. A state
defines its security based on its interests, and its interests are a
product of its values. Historian Melvyn Leffler, in the course of
developing an explanatory framework for studying the history of American
foreign relations, has argued that America's national interest must be
viewed through its "core values." Instead of focusing on narrow
self-defense, Leffler argues, "Core values usually fuse material
self-interest with more fundamental goals like the defense of a state's
organizing ideology, such as liberal capitalism, the protection of its
political institutions, and the safeguarding of its physical base or
territorial integrity."10 Leffler later warned that throughout American
history, imbalances between ideology and a rational understanding of
America's national interest have led to foreign policy disasters. Too
much of the latter leads to heightened threat perceptions, which have in
turn resulted in the misuse of American power abroad.11 However, he
rightly notes that narrow physical security, the internal political
character, and ideological concerns are inextricably tied together when
considering America's interests. If America's values include, for
libertarians, the maintenance of a free society, then it is important to
consider how the external environment of a state affects its internal
character. International pressures help shape the internal character of
states.12 The two are, in fact, intertwined. International order and
domestic political order both serve the purpose of providing security
against organized violence.13 How that order is achieved on both the
international and domestic levels has important implications for both
the likelihood of war and the internal character of a state. Liberal
polities in particular have been interested in the connection between
international order and domestic political order. Political scientist
Daniel Deudney argues that liberal states attempt to shape their
international environment to mitigate anarchy at the international
level. To do so, liberal states practice what Deudney refers to as
"security co-binding." **[Security co-binding is an effort to lock
states into mutually constraining institutions to mitigate the threat
they pose to one another in an anarchic international
system]{.underline}**.14 In t**[he absence of these institutions, states
are likely to balance against the potential threats they pose to one
another by building up their military capabilities. The result of these
military buildups would be rampant security dilemmas. Security dilemmas
occur when defensive measures in one state create a sense of insecurity
in another, producing a response that reduces the security of the first
state, leading to further defensive measures, and so on.15 Security
dilemmas tend to produce arms races and]{.underline}** occasionally
**[spiral into war]{.underline}**.16 In modern Europe, wars that
resulted from these security dilemmas led to recurring cycles of state
building.17

Events in Libya are a further reminder for [Americans]{.underline} that
we [stand at a crossroads in our continuing evolution as the world\'s
sole full-service superpower.]{.underline} Unfortunately**,** we are
increasingly seeking change without cost, and shirking from risk because
we are tired of the responsibility. We don\'t know who we are anymore,
and our president is a big part of that problem. Instead of leading us,
he explains to us. Barack Obama would have us believe that he is
practicing strategic patience. But many experts and ordinary citizens
alike have concluded that he is actually beset by strategic incoherence
\-- in effect, a man overmatched by the job. It is worth first examining
the larger picture: We live in a time of arguably the greatest
structural change in the global order yet endured, with this historical
moment\'s most amazing feature being its relative and absolute lack of
mass violence. That is something to consider when Americans contemplate
military intervention in Libya, because if we do take the step to
prevent larger-scale killing by engaging in some killing of our own, we
will not be adding to some fantastically imagined global death count
stemming from the ongoing \"megalomania\" and \"evil\" of American
\"empire.\" We\'ll be engaging in the same sort of system-administering
activity that has marked our stunningly successful stewardship of global
order since World War II. Let me be more blunt: [[As the guardian of
globalization, the U.S.]{.mark} military [has been the greatest force
for peace]{.mark} the world has ever known[. Had America been
removed]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [the]{.mark} global dynamics that governed
the [20th]{.mark} [century]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} mass [murder never
would have ended.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Indeed, it\'s entirely
conceivable [there would]{.mark} now [be no]{.mark} identifiable human
[civilization]{.mark} left[, once nuclear weapons entered]{.mark} the
killing equation[.]{.mark} But the world did not keep sliding down that
path of perpetual war. Instead, [America]{.mark} stepped up and [changed
everything by]{.mark} ushering in our now-perpetual [great-power
peace.]{.mark} We introduced the international liberal trade order known
as globalization and played loyal Leviathan over its spread. [What
resulted was]{.mark} the collapse of empires[, an explosion of
democracy, the]{.mark} persistent [spread of]{.mark} human
[rights,]{.mark} the [liberation of women,]{.mark} the [doubling of life
expectancy, a]{.mark} roughly [10-fold increase in]{.mark} adjusted
[global GDP and a]{.mark} profound and persistent [reduction in battle
deaths from]{.mark} state-based [conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is
what American \"hubris\" actually delivered. Please remember that the
next time some TV pundit sells you the image of \"unbridled\" American
military power as the cause of global disorder instead of its cure. With
self-deprecation bordering on self-loathing, we now imagine a
post-American world that is anything but. Just watch who scatters and
who steps up as the Facebook revolutions erupt across the Arab world.
While we might imagine ourselves the status quo power, we remain the
world\'s most vigorously revisionist force. As for the sheer \"evil\"
that is our military-industrial complex, again, let\'s examine what the
world looked like before that establishment reared its ugly head. The
last great period of global structural change was the first half of the
20th century, a period that saw a death toll of about 100 million across
two world wars. That comes to an average of 2 million deaths a year in a
world of approximately 2 billion souls. Today, with far more
comprehensive worldwide reporting, researchers report an average of less
than 100,000 battle deaths annually in a world fast approaching 7
billion people. [Though admittedly crude, these calculations suggest a
90 percent absolute drop and a 99 percent relative drop in deaths due to
war. [We are]{.mark} clearly [headed for a world order
characterized]{.mark} by [multipolarity, something the American-birthed
system was designed to]{.mark} both [encourage and accommodate.]{.mark}
But [given how things turned out the last time]{.mark} we collectively
faced such a fluid structure[, we would do well to keep U.S.
power,]{.mark} in all of its forms, deeply [embedded]{.mark} in the
geometry to come.]{.underline} To continue the historical survey, after
salvaging Western Europe from its half-century of civil war, the U.S.
emerged as the progenitor of a new, far more just form of globalization
\-- one based on actual free trade rather than colonialism. America then
successfully replicated globalization further in East Asia over the
second half of the 20th century, setting the stage for the Pacific
Century now unfolding.

####  American growth and leadership solve war -- the alternative is power vacuum conflicts 

**Haass 13** Richard N. Haass, President of the Council on Foreign
Relations, previously served as Director of Policy Planning for the US
State Department The World Without America
https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/repairing-the-roots-of-american-power-by-richard-n\--haass

NEW YORK -- Let me posit a radical idea: The most critical threat facing
the United States now and for the foreseeable future is not a rising
China, a reckless North Korea, a nuclear Iran, modern terrorism, or
climate change. Although all of these constitute potential or actual
threats, [the biggest challenges facing the US are its]{.underline}
burgeoning debt, crumbling infrastructure, second-rate primary and
secondary schools, outdated immigration system, and [**slow economic
growth** -- in short, the domestic foundations of American
power.]{.underline}

Readers in other countries may be tempted to react to this judgment with
a dose of schadenfreude, finding more than a little satisfaction in
America's difficulties. Such a response should not be surprising. The US
and those representing it have been guilty of hubris (the US may often
be the indispensable nation, but it would be better if others pointed
this out), and examples of inconsistency between America's practices and
its principles understandably provoke charges of hypocrisy. When America
does not adhere to the principles that it preaches to others, it breeds
resentment.

But, like most temptations, [the urge to gloat at America's
imperfections and struggles ought to be resisted. People around the
globe should be careful what they wish for. America's failure to deal
with its internal challenges would **come at a steep
price**]{.underline}. Indeed**[, the rest of the world's stake in
American success is nearly as large as that of the US
itself.]{.underline}**

Part of the reason is economic. The US economy still accounts for about
one-quarter of global output. [If US growth accelerates, America's
capacity to consume other countries' goods and services will increase,
thereby **boosting growth around the world**]{.underline}. At a time
when Europe is drifting and Asia is slowing, [only the US]{.underline}
(or, more broadly, North America) [has the potential to drive **global
economic recovery**]{.underline}.

[The US remains a unique source of innovation]{.underline}. Most of the
world's citizens communicate with mobile devices based on technology
developed in Silicon Valley; likewise, the Internet was made in America.
More recently, [new technologies developed in the US greatly increase
the ability to extract **oil and natural gas** from underground
formations. This technology is now making its way around the globe,
allowing other societies to increase their **energy production and
decrease both their reliance on costly imports and their carbon
emissions**.]{.underline}

[The US is also an invaluable source of ideas]{.underline}. Its
world-class universities educate a significant percentage of future
world leaders. More fundamentally, the US has long been a leading
example of what market economies and democratic politics can accomplish.
People and governments around the world are far more likely to become
more open if the American model is perceived to be succeeding.

Finally, [the world faces many serious challenges, ranging from the need
to halt the **spread of weapons of mass destruction, fight climate
change, and maintain a functioning world economic order that promotes
trade and investment to regulating practices in cyberspace, improving
global health, and preventing armed conflicts**. These problems will not
simply go away or sort themselves out.]{.underline}

While Adam Smith's "invisible hand" may ensure the success of free
markets, it is powerless in the world of geopolitics. [Order requires
the visible hand of **leadership** to formulate and realize global
**responses to global challenges**.]{.underline}

Don't get me wrong: None of this is meant to suggest that the US can
deal effectively with the world's problems on its own. Unilateralism
rarely works. It is not just that the US lacks the means; the very
nature of contemporary global problems suggests that only collective
responses stand a good chance of succeeding.

But [multilateralism is much easier to advocate than to design and
implement. Right now **there is only one candidate for this role: the
US**. No other country has the necessary combination of capability and
outlook]{.underline}.

This brings me back to the argument that **[the US must put its house in
order]{.underline}** -- economically, physically, socially, and
politically -- [if it is to have the resources needed to promote order
in the world. Everyone should hope that it does: The alternative to a
world led by the US is not a world led by China, Europe, Russia, Japan,
India, or any other country, but rather **a world that is not led at
all. Such a world would almost certainly be characterized by chronic
crisis and conflict**]{.underline}. That would be bad not just for
Americans, but for the vast majority of the planet's inhabitants.

**NOTE: The net-benefit to the CP is the DIB DA. The CP still maintains
arms sales, whereas the AFF reduces them, which links to the DA. In
addition, the CP reduces military presence abroad, which solves for the
AFF in some, if not all, aspects.**

### Militarism Good/inevitable

#### Militarism is super cool

**Hanjian '14** (Clark Hanjian, He offers support during transitions,
crises, and other difficult times. Clark specializes in working with
conflict, and is available to consult with individuals, organizations,
and communities, "Reconsidering Militarism",
<https://dmzlab.org/reconsidering-militarism>, AA)

Militarism could not exist without support from politics, commerce,
religion, academics, science, media, and entertainment. Third,
militarism is a system dependent on tools of coercion and harm. Remove
these tools, and militarism no longer exists. (For example, when
military forces conduct disaster relief, with no thought of coercion or
harm, such work falls outside the scope of militarism.) Although
militarism has many tools at its disposal, the tools of coercion and
harm are prerequisites. In short, we can say that militarism is
institutionalized self-interest, dependent on tools of coercion and
harm. Because we invest heavily in militarism, it is in our interest to
be very clear about what we get in return. Our reasons for supporting
militarism boil down to these: We believe **that [militarism is critical
to our survival.]{.underline}** [We all need food, water, shelter, and
the conditions for general health, safety, and freedom. **Militarism is
our premier plan to ensure that we get these essentials**.]{.underline}
We believe [that the more resources we control, the more likely it is
that we will be satisfied. **Militarism is our ultimate tool to achieve
satisfaction**.]{.underline} We believe that militarism is a relatively
quick means of resolving conflicts. Our interests are typically tied to
short-term calendars (the next business opportunity, the next election,
etc.), so we are [not inclined to invest in solutions that we know will
span many years]{.underline}. We believe that the mere [threat of
coercion and harm is a useful tool for building respectful, stable, and
sustainable relations. When others get in the way of our interests, we
believe that an act of coercion has the potential to resolve the
conflict. W]{.underline}e believe that forcing others to act against
their will can be a useful tool for setting things right. When others
get in the way of our interests, we believe that an act of harm has the
potential to resolve the conflict. We believe that retaliation,
punishment, and elimination can be useful tools for setting things
right. Nonmilitary approaches to conflict resolution involve substantial
uncertainty. We cannot design a cooperative resolution unless we give
genuine attention to the interests of the adversary. This openness leads
down an unpredictable path. We believe that [militarism offers better
certainty]{.underline}. We believe that [**militarism serves our
financial interests by providing employment and education to some and
wealth to a few**.]{.underline} We believe that **[militarism is
good]{.underline}** for building our sense of community. We feel that by
wielding tools of coercion and harm, we strengthen our identity and
self-esteem. We believe that [military activity is inherently honorable,
and that warriors are, by definition, heroes.]{.underline} We believe
that military attacks deserve military responses. An eye for an eye is
how we teach others a lesson. A to[oth for a tooth is how we maintain
our self-respect. Militarism is our tradition. While there are a
multitude of ways to respond to conflict and acts of malice, we believe
that our warrior tradition deserves high regard due to its extensive
history. We believe that militarism incorporates the highest callings of
our various religious and ethical traditions]{.underline}.

For my own part, I am not much concerned upon that head. As an old

that military training is not all evil. Perhaps some of you will quarrel
with me if I go as far (as I must) as to say that a moderate amount of
the best military training would be a good and not a bad thing for our
young men. I doubt whether even a universal military training would be a
bad thing -- since universal peace cannot be yet established. But
against compulsory military service and against any army system based
upon French or German lines, I have a feeling of the bitterest and the
most implacable hostility. Against [conscription in any form, and

#### Hardline militarism is good-their strategy will guarantee more suffering and death

**HANSON 2004**

(Victor Davis, Professor of Classical Studies at CSU Fresno, City
Journal, Spring, http://www.city-journal.org/html/14_2_the_fruits.html)

[The twentieth century should have taught the citizens of liberal
democracies the catastrophic consequences of placating
tyrants]{.underline}. British and French [restraint over
the]{.underline} occupation of the Rhineland, the
[Anschluss]{.underline}, the absorption of the Czech Sudetenland, and
the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia [did not win gratitude but
rather Hitler's contempt for their weakness. Fifty million dead, the
Holocaust]{.underline}, [and the near destruction of European
civilization were the wages of "appeasement"]{.underline}---a term that
early-1930s liberals proudly embraced as far more enlightened than the
old idea of "deterrence" and "military readiness."

[So too did Western excuses for the Russians' violation of guarantees of
free elections in postwar Eastern Europe]{.underline}, China, and
Southeast Asia [only embolden the Soviet Union]{.underline}. [What
eventually contained Stalinism was the Truman Doctrine, NATO, and
nuclear deterrence---not the United Nations---and what destroyed its
legacy was Ronald Reagan's assertiveness, not Jimmy Carter's
accommodation or Richard Nixon's détente]{.underline}. As long ago as
the fourth century b.c., Demosthenes warned how complacency and
self-delusion among an affluent and free Athenian people allowed a
Macedonian thug like Philip II to end some four centuries of Greek
liberty---and in a mere 20 years of creeping aggrandizement down the
Greek peninsula. Thereafter, [these **historical lessons should have
been clear to citizens of any liberal society: we must neither presume
that comfort and security are our birthrights and are guaranteed without
constant sacrifice and vigilance**, nor expect that peoples outside the
purview of bourgeois liberalism share our commitment to reason,
tolerance, and enlightened self-interest. Most important, military
deterrence and the willingness to use force against evil in its infancy
usually end up, in the terrible arithmetic of war, saving more lives
than they cost]{.underline}. All this can be a hard lesson to relearn
each generation, especially now that we contend with the sirens of the
mall, Oprah, and latte. Our affluence and leisure are as antithetical to
the use of force as rural life and relative poverty once were catalysts
for muscular action. [The age-old lure of appeasement---perhaps they
will cease with this latest concession, perhaps we provoked our enemies,
perhaps demonstrations of our future good intentions will win their
approval---was never more evident than in the recent Spanish elections,
when an affluent European electorate, reeling from the horrific
terrorist attack of 3/11, swept from power the pro-U.S. center-right
government on the grounds that the mass murders were more the fault of
the United States]{.underline} for dragging Spain into the effort to
remove fascists and implant democracy in Iraq [than]{.underline} of the
primordial [al-Qaidist culprits]{.underline}, who long ago promised the
Western and Christian Iberians ruin for the Crusades and the
Reconquista.

#### Militarism is key to leadership and stopping another world war. 

**Brooks 2001**

(david, senior editor at weekly standard, "age of conflict," lexis)

Obviously nobody knows what the future years will feel like, but we do
know that the next decade will have a central feature that was lacking
in the last one: The next few years will be defined by conflict. And
it\'s possible to speculate about what that means. [The institutions
that fight for us and defend us against disorder \-- the military, the
FBI, the CIA \-- will seem more important and more admirable. The
fundamental arguments won\'t be over economic or social issues, they
will be over how to wield power \-- whether to use American power
aggressively or circumspectly. We will care **a lot more** about ends
\-- winning the war \-- than we will about means.]{.underline} We will
debate whether it is necessary to torture prisoners who have information
about future biological attacks. We will destroy innocent villages by
accident, shrug our shoulders, and continue fighting. In an age of
conflict, bourgeois virtues like compassion, tolerance, and
industriousness are valued less than the classical virtues of courage,
steadfastness, and a ruthless desire for victory. \[...continues...\]
But now violence has come calling. Now it is no longer possible to live
so comfortably in one\'s own private paradise. [Shocked out of the
illusion of self-reliance, most of us realize that we, as individuals,
simply cannot protect ourselves. **Private life requires public
protection.** Now it is not possible to ignore foreign affairs, because
foreign affairs have not ignored us. It has become clear that we are
living in a world in which **hundreds of millions** of people hate us,
and some small percentage of them **want to destroy us**]{.underline}.
That realization is bound to have cultural effects. In the first place,
we will probably become more conscious of our American-ness. During the
blitz in 1940, George Orwell sat in his bomb shelter and wrote an essay
called \"England Your England.\" It opened with this sentence: \"As I
write, highly civilised human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill
me.\" What struck him at that moment of danger was that it really does
matter whether you are English or German. The nation is a nursemaid that
breeds certain values and a certain ethos. Orwell went on to describe
what it meant to be English. Now Americans are being killed simply
because they are Americans. Like Orwell, Americans are once again
becoming aware of themselves as a nationality, not just as members of
some ethnic community or globalized Internet chat group. Americans have
been reminded that, despite what the multiculturalists have been
preaching, [not all cultures are wonderfully equal hues in the great
rainbow of humanity. Some national cultures, the ones that have
inherited certain ideas \-- about freedom and democracy, the limits of
the political claims of religion, the importance of tolerance and
dissent \-- are **more humane** than other civilizations, which reject
those ideas]{.underline}. As criticism of our war effort grows in
Europe, in hostile Arab countries, and in two-faced countries like Egypt
and Saudi Arabia, which dislike our principles but love our dollars,
Americans will have to articulate a defense of our national principles
and practices. That debate in itself will shape American culture. We
will begin to see ourselves against the backdrop of the Taliban. During
the Cold War, we saw ourselves in contrast to the Soviet Union. Back
then, we faced a godless foe; now we are facing a god-crazed foe. As we
recoil from the Islamic extremists, we may be less willing to integrate
religion into political life. That would mean trouble for faith-based
initiatives and religion in the public square. On the other hand,
democracies tend to become patriotic during wartime, if history is any
guide, and this will drive an even deeper wedge between regular
Americans and the intellectual class. Literary critic Paul Fussell, a
great student of American culture in times of war, wrote a book,
Wartime, on the cultural effects of World War II. Surveying the culture
of that period, he endorsed the view of historian Eileen Sullivan, who
wrote, \"[There was **no room** in this war culture for **individual
opinions** or personalities, **no freedom of dissent or approval**; the
culture was homogeneous, shallow and boring.\"]{.underline}
\[...continues...\] Don\'t make the mistake of interpreting the events
of Sept. 11 purely in terms of terrorism and murder. . . . The
terrorists are a virulent subset of a much larger group of
anticapitalists, one that includes many politicians, bureaucrats,
writers, media types, academics, entertainers, trade unionists and, at
times, church leaders. The barbarians at the gates are more numerous
than you thought. But the most important cultural effect of conflict is
that it breeds a certain bloody-mindedness or, to put it more grandly, a
tragic view of life. Life in times of war and recession reminds us of
certain hard truths that were easy to ignore during the decade of peace
and prosperity. [**Evil exists**. Difficulties, even tragedies, are
**inevitable**. Human beings are flawed creatures capable of
monstrosity. Not all cultures are compatible. To preserve order, good
people must **exercise power over destructive people.**]{.underline}
That means that [it\'s no longer sufficient to deconstruct ideas and
texts and signifiers. You have to be able to **construct hard principles
so you can move from one idea to the next**, because when you are faced
with the problem of repelling evil, you absolutely must be able to reach
a conclusion on serious moral issues.]{.underline} This means you need
to think in moral terms about force \-- and to be tough-minded. During
the Cold War, Reinhold Niebuhr was a major intellectual figure. In 1952,
he wrote The Irony of American History. The tragedy of the conflict with
communism, he argued, was that, \"though confident of its virtue,
[\[America\] must yet hold atomic bombs ready for use so as to prevent a
possible **world conflagration**]{.underline}.\" The irony of our
history, he continued, is that we are an idealistic nation that dreams
of creating a world of pure virtue, yet in defeating our enemies we
sometimes have to act in ways that are not pure. \"We take, and must
continue to take, morally hazardous action to preserve our
civilization,\" Niebuhr wrote. \"**[We must exercise our
power]{.underline}**.\" We have to do so while realizing that we will
not be capable of perfect disinterestedness when deciding which actions
are just. We will be influenced by dark passions. [But we still have to
**act forcefully** because our enemies are trying to **destroy** the
basis of civilization: \"We are drawn into an historic situation in
which the paradise of our domestic security is suspended in a **hell of
global insecurity**]{.underline}.\" Niebuhr\'s prescription was humble
hawkishness. He believed the United States should forcefully defend
freedom and destroy its enemies. But while doing so, it should seek
forgiveness for the horrible things it might have to do in a worthy
cause. To reach this graduate-school level of sophistication, you have
to have passed through elementary courses in moral reasoning. It will be
interesting to see whether we Americans, who sometimes seem unsure of
even the fundamental moral categories, can educate ourselves
sufficiently to engage in the kind of moral reasoning that Niebuhr did.
The greatest political effect of this period of conflict will probably
be to relegitimize central institutions. Since we can\'t defend
ourselves as individuals against terrorism, we have to rely on the
institutions of government: the armed forces, the FBI, the CIA, the CDC,
and so on. We are now only beginning to surrender some freedoms, but we
will trade in more, and willingly. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the
Federalist Papers, \"Safety from external danger is the most powerful
director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will,
after a time, give way to its dictates. . . . To be more safe,
\[people\] at length become willing to run the risk of being less
free.\" Moreover, we will see power migrate from the states and Capitol
Hill to the White House. \"It is of the nature of war to increase the
executive at the expense of the legislative authority,\" Hamilton
continued. This creates rifts on both left and right, because both
movements contain anti-establishment elements hostile to any effort to
relegitimize central authorities. The splits have been most spectacular
on the left. Liberals who work in politics \-- Democrats on Capitol
Hill, liberal activists, academics who are interested in day-to-day
politics \-- almost all support President Bush and the war effort. But
many academic and literary leftists, ranging from Eric Foner to Susan
Sontag to Noam Chomsky, have been sour, critical, and contemptuous of
America\'s response to September 11. The central difference is that the
political liberals are comfortable with power. They want power
themselves and do not object to the central institutions of government,
even the military, exercising power on our behalf. Many [literary and
academic liberals, on the other hand, have built a whole moral system
around powerlessness.]{.underline} They champion the outgroups. [They
stand with the victims of hegemony, patriarchy, colonialism, and all the
other manifestations of central authority. Sitting on their campuses,
they are powerless themselves]{.underline}, and have embraced a
delicious, self-glorifying identity as the out-manned sages who alone
can see through the veils of propaganda in which the powerful hide their
oppressive schemes. For these thinkers, virtue inheres in the powerless.
The weak are sanctified, not least because they are voiceless and
allegedly need academics to give them voices. These outgroup leftists
dislike the Taliban, but to ally themselves with American power would be
to annihilate everything they have stood for and the role they have
assigned themselves in society. \[...continues...\] For Bush, the leader
of the free world, the issue is terrorism, not street crime. But now he
too is engaged in the effort to restore order so that people can go
about their lives. He is the one rounding up the posse, forsaking social
issues and other moral debates for a straightforward act of
international prosecution. He is reasserting authority to show that
under Pax Americana, the world is governable. \[...continues...\] But
history never repeats itself neatly. No one can predict the political
and cultural consequences of a war, any more than the course of the war
itself. But it does seem clear that we have moved out of one political
and cultural moment and into another. We have traded the anxieties of
affluence for the real fears of war. We have moved from an age of peace
to an age of conflict, and in times of conflict people are different.
They go to extremes. Some people, and some nations, turn cowardly or
barbaric. Other people, and other nations, become heroic, brave, and
steadfast. It all depends on what they have in them. War isn\'t only, as
Bourne said, the health of the state. It\'s the gut-check of the nation.

#### Militarism is the only way to deal with global terrorism. 

**Epstein, 2002** (Alex, fellow at Ayn Rand Institute, "Peacenik
Warmongers," online, 12/16/2002)

If dropping bombs won\'t work, what should the United States do to
obtain a peaceful relationship with the numerous hostile regimes,
including Iraq, that seek to harm us with terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction? The \"peace advocates\" offer no answer. The most one can
coax out of them are vague platitudes (we should \"make common cause
with the people of the world,\" says the prominent \"anti-war\" group
Not in Our Name) and agonized soul-searching (\"Why do they hate us?\").
The absence of a peacenik peace plan is no accident. [Pacifism is
**inherently a negative doctrine**\--it merely says that military action
is always bad]{.underline}. As one San Francisco protestor put the
point: \"I don\'t think it\'s right for our government to kill people.\"
In practice, [this leaves the government only two means of dealing with
our enemies: to ignore their acts of aggression, or to **appease them**
by capitulating to the aggressor\'s demands. We do not need to predict
or deduce the consequences of pacifism with regard to terrorism and the
nations that sponsor it, because we experienced those consequences on
September 11]{.underline}. Pacifism practically dictated the American
response to terrorism for more than 23 years, beginning with our
government\'s response to the first major act of Islamic terrorism
against this country: when Iranian mobs held 52 Americans hostage for
444 days at the American embassy in Tehran. [In response to that and
later terrorist atrocities, American Presidents sought to avoid military
action at all costs\--]{.underline}by treating terrorists as isolated
criminals and thereby ignoring the role of the governments that support
them, or by offering diplomatic handouts to terrorist states in hopes
that they would want to be our friends. [With each pacifist response it
became clearer that the most powerful nation on Earth was a **paper
tiger**\--and our enemies **made the most of it**. After years of
American politicians acting like peaceniks, Islamic terrorism had
**proliferated** from a few gangs of thugs to a worldwide
scourge\--making possible the attacks of September 11]{.underline}. It
is an obvious evasion of history and logic for the advocates of pacifism
to label themselves \"anti-war,\" **since the policies they advocate
necessarily invite escalating acts of war against anyone who practices
them. [Military inaction sends the message to an
aggressor]{.underline}\--and to other, potential aggressors\--[that it
will benefit by attacking the United States.]{.underline}** [To whatever
extent \"anti-war\" protesters influence policy, they are not helping to
prevent war; they are acting to **make war more frequent and deadly**,
by making our enemies more aggressive, more plentiful, and more
powerful. **The only way to deal with militant enemies is to show them
unequivocally that aggression against the United States will lead to
their destruction**]{.underline}. The only means of imparting this
lesson is overwhelming military force\--enough to defeat and
incapacitate the enemy. Had we annihilated the Iranian regime 23 years
ago, we could have thwarted Islamic terrorism at the beginning, with far
less cost than will be required to defeat terrorism today. [And if we
fail to use our military against state sponsors of terrorism today,
imagine the challenge we will face five years from now when Iraq and
Iran possess nuclear weapons and are ready to disseminate them to their
terrorist minions.]{.underline} Yet such a world is the goal of the
\"anti-war\" movement. [The **suicidal** stance of peaceniks is no
innocent error or mere overflow of youthful idealism]{.underline}. It is
the product of a fundamentally immoral commitment: the commitment to
ignore reality\--from the historical evidence of the consequences of
pacifism to the very existence of the violent threats that confront us
today\--in favor of the wish that laying down our arms will achieve
peace somehow.

### Specificity good

#### Mindsets based on specificity key to any real resolution of the problem

**International Alert '12** (International Alert is a 26-year-old
independent peacebuilding organisation. We work with people who are
directly affected by violent conflict to improve their prospects of
peace. And we seek to influence the policies and ways of working of
governments, international organisations like the UN and multinational
companies, to reduce conflict risk and increase the prospects of peace,

AA)

The **[lack of a truly context-specific response to conflict and the
challenges of building peace in eastern DRC risk pernicious
effects]{.underline}**. Agencies' standard post-conflict interventions
are simply not working. Responsibility for these failures lies not only
with agencies themselves, but also with the Congolese government, which
has come to deliberately prefer a technical rather than a political
conversation with its international partners. In an effort to assert its
sovereignty since securing legitimacy at the polls, the government is
increasingly reluctant to offer international partners any opportunity
to influence the 6 International Alert country's policy agenda, least of
all governance reforms. In other cases, programmes are implemented by a
Congolese civil society that is divided and losing legitimacy. **[A
technocratic ethos of intervention can never hope to effect real
in-depth change, tending instead to address the consequences of the
problems]{.underline}**.

# Offcase

## Just not the sales CP

#### CP text: The United States federal government should substantially reduce their military presence abroad but maintain arms sales to other countries. 

**Military presence abroad causes several negative effects for the
United States and other countries. Glaser 16,** John Glaser [is
Associate Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, "Why
We Should Close America\'s Overseas Military Bases", 11/07/16,
<https://time.com/4511744/>american-military-bases-overseas/,
JGS]{.mark}

Despite our unorthodox presidential election, America's overseas
military bases are largely taken for granted in today's foreign policy
debates. The U.S. maintains a veritable empire of military bases
throughout the world---[about
800](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321)of
them in more than 70 countries. Many view our bases as a symbol of our
status as the dominant world power. But **[America's forward-deployed
military posture incurs substantial costs and disadvantages, exposing
the U.S. to vulnerabilities and unintended consequences. Our overseas
bases simply do not pay enough dividends when it comes to core national
interests.]{.underline}** Here are seven reasons why it's time to close
them. 1. **[They don't protect the homeland from direct
attack.]{.underline}** U.S. leaders often argue that bases are the
centerpiece of [a liberal, rules-based world
order](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-08-07/building-success).
They claim that bases in Europe protect European allies from Russia,
bases in the Middle East ensure the free flow of oil and contain Iranian
influence, and bases in Asia defend our Asian allies from a rising China
and an unstable North Korea. But stationing 80,000 troops at 350
installations in Europe is not directly related to securing Americans'
physical safety. The same goes for the more than 154,000 active-duty
personnel based throughout Asia. And the argument that maintaining a
forward-deployed military posture in the Middle East [protects the free
flow of
oil](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/opinion/12press.html?_r=0) is
supported by [pitifully
sparse](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/why-the-middle-east-still-doesnt-matter-111747)[empirical
evidence](https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/less-more-future-us-military-persian-gulf).
If we [brought our troops
home](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/americas/2011-10-14/wisdom-retrenchment),
we wouldn't be much more or less safe than we are now. That's mostly
because we are already the strongest nation economically and militarily
by far and [probably the most secure great power in
history](http://www.cato.org/policy-report/septemberoctober-2014/most-dangerous-world-ever),
isolated from other powerful states by two great oceans and protected
with an arsenal of thousands of nuclear weapons. On top of that, the
world is a safer place these days. Interstate conflict has [declined
dramatically](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010) in
recent decades and may even be [on a path
to](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq12SummerTertrais.pdf) [obsolescence](https://www.amazon.com/Retreat-Doomsday-Obsolescence-Major-War/dp/0465069398) for
reasons that have little to do with all these military bases.
2. **[Their deterrence effect is overrated. The deterrence value of
bases is frequently exaggerated. Even during the Cold War, as Robert
Johnson
has [argued](https://www.amazon.com/Improbable-Dangers-Conceptions-Threat-After/dp/1934849111),
the Soviet threat was subject to "undue alarmism," and "even without
American forces deployed in Western Europe, a Soviet attack was
extremely unlikely.]{.underline}**" According to international relations
scholar [Robert
Jervis](http://www.ou.edu/uschina/SASD/SASD2006/Jervis2001CWSecDil.pdf),
"The Soviet archives have yet to reveal any serious plans for unprovoked
aggression against Western Europe, not to mention a first strike on the
United States." Deterrence can also sometimes have the opposite of the
intended effect. For example, many see the U.S. military presence in
Europe as deterring Russian military aggression, but Russia's
interventions in places like Georgia and Ukraine derive more
from [Russian
insecurities](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/russias-perpetual-geopolitics) [about
the
expansion](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2014-08-18/why-ukraine-crisis-west-s-fault) of
U.S.-led Western economic and military institutions than from signs of
American weakness or insufficient military presence in Eastern Europe.
Post-Cold War NATO expansion, in particular, is the source of [profound
anxiety and lingering
resentment](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-shifrinson-russia-us-nato-deal--20160530-snap-story.html) in
Moscow that arguably makes things less stable, not more. 3. **[They
don't always effectively prevent nuclear proliferation.]{.underline}**
Another core argument is that the U.S.'s forward presence prevents arms
races, particularly nuclear proliferation, by reassuring allies. The
record on that score is mixed. **[While U.S. security guarantees to
countries like Japan and South Korea have likely dissuaded them from
developing nuclear weapons, those same guarantees can provoke nuclear
proliferation in other regional actors, like North Korea.]{.underline}**
Prior to the recent nuclear deal, Iran built up its nuclear program in
large part as a deterrent to threatening nearby U.S. bases. And allied
countries, like Britain, France, and Israel, acquired nukes despite the
protection of in-country or nearby U.S. bases. 4. **[They can encourage
resentment. Local resentment over the presence of foreign military bases
can linger for generations, as was the case when in 1991 the Philippine
Senate "assailed \[the U.S. military presence\] as a vestige of
colonialism and an affront to Philippine sovereignty]{.underline}**,"
and President Corazon C. Aquino [ordered full
withdrawal](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/28/world/philippines-orders-us-to-leave-strategic-navy-base-at-subic-bay.html?pagewanted=all).
And this past June in Japan, [65,000 Okinawans protested in the
streets](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/20/world/asia/japan-okinawa-protest-united-states-military.html?_r=0) against
the U.S. presence there. Sometimes such resentment can be
extreme. [According to Chicago
University's](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/stille/Politics%20Fall%202007/readings%20weeks%206-7/Strategic%20Logic%20of%20Suicide%20Missions.pdf)[Robert

"the principal cause of suicide terrorism is resistance to foreign
occupation." Indeed, the presence of U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia
was one of the most prominent
grievances [cited](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/edicts.html) by
al-Qaeda pre-9/11 in order to rally Muslims against America. And since
the surge in U.S. military presence in the region post-9/11, terrorist
attacks on troops and bases in the Middle East have dramatically
increased. 5. **[They can cause the U.S. to support brutal
dictatorships. In Uzbekistan, the recently deceased dictator Islam
Karimov
was [famous](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/12/13/uzbekistan-detainees-tortured-lawyers-silenced) for
massacres and widespread torture, yet nevertheless [received U.S.
backing](https://newrepublic.com/article/120911/obama-administration-gives-uzbekistans-karimov-military-machines) in
exchange for [basing
rights](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-turns-to-other-routes-to-supply-afghan-war-as-relations-with-pakistan-fray/2011/06/30/AGfflYvH_story.html).]{.underline}**
During the Arab Spring in Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is
stationed, the regime cracked down on peaceful dissent with [gross human
rights
violations](https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/22/bahrain-widespread-crackdown-systematic-abuse).
But Washington kept largely silent
(and [willing](https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/08/us-wrong-time-bahrain-arms-deal) to [continue
sending money and arms to the
regime](http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/01/27/obama-administration-using-loophole-to-quietly-sell-arms-package-to-bahrain/))
because the base is considered so geopolitically important. 6**[. They
risk entangling us in unnecessary wars. U.S. bases often cause officials
to urge American intervention wherever conflict might break out. But
this risks entangling us in foreign wars that are none of our
business.]{.underline}** If conflict breaks out over maritime or
territorial disputes in the East and South China Sea, the U.S. may be
obligated to intervene against China to fulfill its security guarantee
to Taiwan, Japan, or the Philippines. Getting into a war with China over
some uninhabited rocks of no strategic importance to us is not in our
interests. Before the nuclear deal with Iran, there
was [apparently](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-17115643) [a
real
risk](http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-pressure-nixed-israeli-strike-on-iran-in-2012/) Israel
would preventively strike one of Iran's nuclear facilities. Because of
American promises to fight for Israel, U.S. bases in Bahrain [would have
been a
priority](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/IranReport_091112_FINAL.pdf)target
in Iranian retaliatory strikes.That would have brought us into another
desperate quagmire in the Middle East, which is frankly the last thing
we need. 7. Technology has largely made them obsolete. Some argue that
bases allow rapid military response. That's certainly true to some
extent. But modern military technology has significantly reduced the
problems of travel times over long distances. According to a
recent [RAND Corporation
report](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR200/RR201/RAND_RR201.pdf),
"lighter ground forces can deploy by air from the United States almost
as quickly as they can from within a region." Long-range bombers can fly
missions up to 9,000 miles, and after that they can be refueled in the
air, reducing the need to have in-place forces abroad. The bottom line
is that troops can deploy to virtually any region fast enough to be
based right here in America. But even this misses the point. We
shouldn't be intervening militarily all over the world unless there is a
clear and present danger to U.S. security. Despite the habitual [threat
inflation](http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/dangers-alarmism) in
our [politics](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/29/lindsey-graham-syria_n_4687259.html) and [punditry](http://video.foxnews.com/v/4839814669001/eric-shawn-reports-the-iran-missile-threat/?#sp=show-clips),
the world is [increasingly
peaceful](http://www.vox.com/2016/8/16/12486586/2016-worst-year-ever-violence-trump-terrorism),
and the U.S. is exceptionally insulated from [foreign
dangers](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-08-15/how-safe-are-we).
Our remarkable level of security simply doesn't call for such an
activist foreign policy.

[The Trump administration is nearing completion of a]{.underline} new
\"Buy American\" [plan that calls]{.underline} for U.S. military
attaches and diplomats to help drum up billions of dollars more in
business overseas for the American weapons industry, [going beyond the
assistance they currently provide]{.underline}, U.S. officials said.
President Donald [Trump]{.underline} as early as February [is
expected]{.underline} to announce a \"whole of government\" effort [to
ease export rules on purchases by foreign countries of U.S.-made
military equipment]{.underline}, from fighter jets and drones to
warships and artillery, according to people familiar with the plan.
Trump is seeking to fulfill a 2016 election campaign promise to create
jobs in the United States by selling more goods and services abroad to
bring down the U.S. trade deficit from a six-year high of \$50 billion.
The administration is also under pressure from U.S. defense contractors
facing growing competition from foreign rivals such as China and Russia.
But any loosening of the restrictions on weapons sales would be in
defiance of human rights and arms control advocates who said there was
too great a risk of fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East
and South Asia or arms being diverted to be used in terrorist attacks.
Besides greater use of a network of military and commercial attaches
already stationed at U.S. embassies in foreign capitals, senior
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said [another thrust of
the plan will be to set in motion a realignment of]{.underline} the
International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a central
policy [governing arms exports]{.underline} since 1976 and has not been
fully revamped in more than three decades. This expanded government
effort on behalf of American arms makers, together with looser
restrictions on weapons exports and more favorable treatment of sales to
non-NATO allies and partners, could bring additional billions of dollars
in deals and more jobs, a senior U.S. official said, without providing
specifics. The strategy of [having the Pentagon]{.underline} and the
U.S. State Department [take a more active role in securing foreign arms
deals could]{.underline} especially [benefit]{.underline} major [defense
contractors]{.underline} such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co. \"We
want to see those guys, the commercial and military attaches, unfettered
to be salesmen for this stuff, to be promoters,\" said the senior
administration official, who is close to the internal deliberations and
spoke on condition of anonymity. A State Department official, asked to
confirm details of the coming new policy, said **[the]{.underline}**
revamped **[approach]{.underline}** \"gives our partners a greater
capacity to help share the burden of international security, **[benefits
the defense industrial base]{.underline}** and will provide more good
jobs for American workers.\" The White House and Pentagon declined
official comment. Defense industry officials and lobbyists have
privately welcomed what they expect will be a more sales-friendly
approach. It is unclear how deeply the diplomats and military officers
overseas will delve into dealmaking and what guidelines will be
established, said officials in the administration. [Trump]{.underline},
a Republican, [has the]{.underline} legal [authority to
direct]{.underline} government embassy \"security [assistance
officers]{.underline},\" both military personnel and civilians, to do
more [to]{.underline} help [drive arms sales.]{.underline}
Administration officials see this group, which already has duties such
as managing military aid overseas and providing information to foreign
governments for buying U.S. arms, as underutilized by previous
presidents. One national security analyst said that easing export
restrictions to allow defense contractors to reap greater profits
internationally would increase the danger of top-of-the-line U.S.
weapons going to governments with poor human rights records or being
used by militants. \"This administration has demonstrated from the very
beginning that human rights have taken a back seat to economic
concerns,\" said Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense
program at the Stimson Center in Washington. \"And the short-sightedness
of a new arms export policy could have serious long-term implications.\"
The administration officials said human rights considerations would
remain part of the formula for arms sales decisions. But they said such
reviews would now afford greater weight than before to whether a deal
would be good for the U.S. economy and strengthen America\'s defense
industrial base, in which case red tape would be cut accordingly. Rules
to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and compete
against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals are also expected to be
in the Trump plan, officials said. Trump\'s Democratic predecessor,
Barack Obama, also sought to make it easier to sell to America\'s most
trusted allies but in a more cautious approach that his administration
billed as a way to boost American business while keeping strict controls
against more dangerous arms proliferation. Foreign weapons sales soared
during his tenure, with the United States retaining its position as the
world\'s top arms supplier. Shares of the five biggest U.S. defense
contractors, including Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon Co, General Dynamics
Corp and Northrop Grumman have more than tripled over the last five
years and currently trade at or near all-time highs. [Foreign military
sales]{.underline} in fiscal 2017, comprising much of Trump\'s first
year in office and the final months of Obama\'s term, [climbed to \$42
billion, compared to \$31 billion]{.underline} in the prior year,
according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [has]{.underline} already [moved
forward on]{.underline} several controversial [sales]{.underline}. Those
include a push for \$7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi
Arabia despite concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the
Saudi campaign in Yemen\'s civil war and the unblocking of \$3 billion
in arms to Bahrain, which was also held up by human rights concerns
under Obama. Similar concerns have been raised over the
administration\'s preparations to make it easier for American gun makers
to sell small arms, including assault rifles and ammunition, to foreign
buyers. A draft of the new policy proposals recently finished by
inter-agency teams coordinated by Trump\'s National Security Council
must now be approved by a select group of senior cabinet members before
being sent to his desk, the government sources said. Once Trump
announces an extensive framework of the plan, there will be a 60-day
public comment period. After that, [the administration is expected to
unveil further details]{.underline}. Some of the changes are expected to
take the form of what is formally known as a presidential \"National
Security Decision Directive,\" two of the sources said.

[US defense]{.underline} strategy [requires]{.underline} an
[improvement]{.underline} in its security assistance program to
adequately empower allies [and partners to]{.underline} provide for
their own security and to [support the US defense-industrial
base]{.underline}. A struggling global economy and shrinking defense
budgets, however, may hamper such efforts. Allies and partners struggle
in their attempt at spending adequate amounts on defense, and US budget
reductions may reduce America's defense spending, thus curtailing
foreign military aid and revenues available to US defense contractors.
[Without adequate levels of revenue, the already brittle defense-
industrial base may be incapable of developing technologies and offering
the American military the best capabilities in the future.]{.underline}

Ultimately, major reductions in defense spending will lead suppliers, as
well as research and development projects, to fall by the wayside. An
"American Way of War" that has utilized technology to offset
quantitative advantages of our opponents may not be sustainable.2
Accordingly, [with a limited defense budget, the United States needs to
find new ways to simultaneously provide for national security, while
maintaining its industrial base.]{.underline} Improved security
assistance will be a key pillar of this effort. Without significant
reforms that increase US responsiveness and competitiveness in the
global defense market, efforts to innovate will be impacted.
Fortunately, [the United States can improve the existing security
assistance apparatus by reforming export controls]{.underline}, updating
legislation, expanding financing programs, and developing a dedicated
security assistance workforce.

The Value of Security Assistance

Security assistance is a form of security cooperation that contains
programs through which the United States provides defense articles and
services to international organizations and foreign governments in
support of US policies and objectives. Although usually administered by
the Department of Defense (DOD), specifically the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA), these programs are legally under the control
of the Department of State. Major security assistance categories include
Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), and
International Military Education and Training. Through the FMS process,
the US government procures defense articles, services, and training on
behalf of the foreign customer country, under the auspices of the DSCA.
Sizable sales also occur through the DCS process between a foreign
country and a US contractor.

The strategic rationale for increased security [assistance]{.underline}
is two-fold: it empowers regional partners and allies, and it [sustains
the defense-industrial base through increased US exports]{.underline}.
US efforts during the Second World War and the US security architecture
throughout the Cold War utilized security assistance funding to bolster
the defenses of regional allies against the spread of fascism and
communism. Although the Cold War has ended, [US support of strategic
"strong points" continues as an economical means to check power
imbalances among countries and counter state instability.]{.underline}

Although security assistance consists of much more than arms sales, [the
transfer of major weapons systems does permit the United States to
access and influence various nations.]{.underline} For example, [a
nation will]{.underline} not simply buy a squadron of F-16 fighters. It
will [send its pilots to the United States for training, bring in US
contractors to conduct maintenance and logistics activities, and engage
in a strategic dialogue with the United States on the employment of
assets]{.underline}. Common technology and materiel builds similar
Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), [promoting interoperability with
nations that may later become coalition partners]{.underline}. Thus
[arms]{.underline} contracts are not only an end to themselves but also
[serve as a means to develop a relationship with a particular
nation]{.underline}. Indeed, foreign [countries]{.underline} often
relish the chance to [procure American technology and equipment
beyond]{.underline} the [obvious material benefits, leveraging the
experience and geopolitical strength of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is a potential asset for their own national
security.]{.underline}

Additionally[, security assistance activities build relationships
between the United States and partner militaries in a way other
activities often do not.]{.underline} As last year's events in Egypt
demonstrated, the professional relationship between militaries can open
avenues of communication necessary for the United States to fully
comprehend a situation, exercise its foreign policy, and promote peace
and stability in what otherwise may be a chaotic situation.

The persistence of counterterror and counterinsurgency campaigns over
the past decade reinforces the value of access to theaters that security
assistance enables.

These campaigns also highlight the extended duration of these types of
conflicts and the associated political and financial costs. In the
future, [America will need to maximize the ability of]{.underline}
national [governments to handle crises]{.underline} and conflicts
[without direct US involvement. Building a partner's capacity to
undertake operations]{.underline} is a cost-effective matter that
[addresses their own security challenges while reducing the prospect of
US military action]{.underline}, and heightens the likelihood of saving
blood and treasure for all concerned. This approach has succeeded in the
Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and a host of other countries.

[The challenging fiscal environment]{.underline} the United States is
facing [will accentuate these trends]{.underline}, pushing the United
States to encourage other states to spend more on defense. The fiscal
challenges of allies and partner states will, however, also
simultaneously reduce available defense revenues. For example, NATO
Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen worryingly pointed out in 2011
how "over the past two years defense spending by NATO's European member
nations has shrunk by some 45 billion dollars---that is the equivalent
of Germany's entire annual defense budget."3 The United States' fiscal
situation will likely reduce the level of US funding available to other
nations. Proposals to simply increase the amount spent on security
assistance will not resonate well either within the Pentagon or on
Capitol Hill. Consequently, the existing US security assistance
apparatus will need to become more capable and efficient.

[Another motivating factor for improving security assistance is the
continued success of the US defense-industrial base. Without a strong
industrial base, bolstered by]{.underline} international [transfers,
prices of US acquisitions could increase]{.underline} at a time [when
other nation's]{.underline} defense [budgets are falling. Decreased US
defense spending will aggravate market deviations already prevalent in
the]{.underline} relatively closed and single-buyer, or monopolistic,
[arms industry]{.underline}. Throughout various defense sectors,
[few]{.underline} major prime [contractors are capable of producing key
products, hampering competition]{.underline}. [The situation
is]{.underline} even more [perilous among]{.underline} subcomponent
[manufacturers]{.underline}. For example, in the precision guided
munitions sector, Eagle Picher produces almost all thermal battery
units; Honeywell produces Inertial Measurement Units (IMU); and Rockwell
Collins produces Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. All three
are primarily the sole-source suppliers of Raytheon, Lockheed Martin,
and Boeing.4 Another example can be seen in the world of mine warfare
where the Navy's Mk71 Naval Quickstrike Mines program has faltered as
the only company manufacturing a component of the Target Detection
Device went out of business. [Further]{.underline} defense
[cuts]{.underline}, absent compensating offsets, [could significantly
affect the industry]{.underline}. [Critics might argue defense
cuts]{.underline} will [stabilize the market]{.underline} and rectify
market errors. In doing so, however, [they assume the]{.underline}
defense [industry is a]{.underline} truly [competitive market, which
is]{.underline} certainly [not the case.]{.underline} Rather, [a key
element of sustaining the defense-industrial base will be export sales
as a means for sustaining production]{.underline} lines [and generating
revenues]{.underline} (profits) [necessary for long-term research and
development.]{.underline}

Recognizing these trends, a number of national defense companies around
the globe, particularly in Europe, such as BAE Systems and Fincantierri,
have shifted the majority of their operations abroad, including to the
United States, establishing parallel "home markets." With a number of
major actors in the defense market generally spending less on defense,
international competition will be fierce.

US defense companies have made adjustments. For example, in Boeing's
defense unit foreign sales currently make up 18 percent of its sales,
compared with 7 percent six years ago, and the company has a goal of
boosting this market share to 25 percent within the next five years.5
According to the DSCA, despite fierce competition, US companies are
expected to have sold a record \$46.1 billion in military hardware to
foreign governments in 2011.6 By value, the United States already is the
largest arms exporter in the world, and defense goods and services are
one of the strongest US exports.

Additional [exports will be needed to pick up]{.underline} any [slack
generated by US defense reductions]{.underline}. Also, more exports are
required in an effort to sustain the US strategic advantage in such
areas as aerospace systems. To sustain this US advantage, internal
government and industry procedures require comprehensive reform.

Limits of the Security Assistance Apparatus

The aforementioned demands on security assistance capabilities often
encounter a system that is inadequate to support the task. The current
process is primarily founded on a collection of programs authorized by
the US Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act of
1976. In the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, Secretary Gates said the
existing system is "constrained by a complex patchwork of authorities,
persistent shortfalls in resources, unwieldy processes, and a limited
ability to sustain such undertakings beyond a short period." In the 2011
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Guidance, Admiral Mullen stated
the current process is outdated, cumbersome, top-heavy, and adversely
affects US military posture.7

Not every aspect of the security assistance system needs reform, but
certain outdated elements and sclerotic bureaucratic processes have left
the United States lagging behind other nations. Secretary of Defense
Gates wrote that other countries have been "more quickly funding
projects, selling weapons, and building relationships."8

Over the last decade, the United States attempted to improve its
security assistance capabilities in response to overseas contingency
operations. Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2006, as amended and regularly extended, provides
the Secretary of Defense, through requests by Combatant Commanders, with
authority to train and equip foreign military forces for two specified
purposes: counterterrorism and stability operations, and foreign
maritime security forces for counterterrorism operations. Funds need to
receive the concurrence of the Secretary of State. For fiscal year 2010,
the United States dedicated \$340.6 million to support bilateral
programs in 18 countries and one multilateral program for seven
recipients (including three receiving bilateral aid).9 Congress, thus
far, has refrained from codifying

Section 1206 in permanent law, as requested by DOD. More importantly,
though, the successes in counterterrorism and stability operations aid
dispensation through Section 1206 funding have not translated into
improvements in US Foreign Military Sales or Direct Commercial Sales
effectiveness or efficiency, especially with regard to major systems
which could boost the sales. For these reasons, further security
assistance reforms are required.

The Global Perspective

The United States is not the only global provider of defense materiel
and services. Numerous other nations have sophisticated arms industries
that compete with the United States. Some, such as Sweden, have
specialized industries in aerospace or small arms, while others, such as
Russia, compete across a wide spectrum of capabilities. The majority of
these competitors are not military opponents of the United States. Of
the 15 largest arms exporters in the world, nine are allies (Canada,
France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Korea, Netherlands, Spain, and the
United Kingdom) and a further two are close US partners (Sweden and
Switzerland).10 In the future, the United States should pursue
defense-industrial collaboration among allied countries through
mechanisms such as co-development to achieve necessary economies of
scale in research and production. In spite of any future collaboration,
international competition between the United States and its allies will
continue and, in all likelihood, intensify.

Overshadowing this competitive arena is the global economic downturn.
With a few key exceptions among major actors such as China, India, and
Brazil, defense budgets are shrinking. Concomitantly, international
defense-industrial competition remains at an all-time high. The demand
for defense products is generally decreasing while capacity remains
constant. In the current decade, [the United States will need to
compete]{.underline} more intensely for each arms contract [if we are to
enjoy the]{.underline} national security [benefits]{.underline} security
assistance provides.

Defense procurement decisions are not just about capabilities or even
geopolitics; they are also, at their core, business and fiscal
decisions. Restrictions placed on the use of US hardware and total cost
competition can at times reduce the US sales advantage. This is
particularly true in the case of large acquisition projects, such as
aircraft; most countries are unable, or unwilling, to pay exor- bitant
prices upfront. As with any other business venture, sellers offer
financing programs to fund these large-scale projects. The US financing
system, once robust during the Cold War era when there was a strong
political incentive to ensure nations had equipment to ght communism,
atrophied in the 1990s when there was no longer a pressing need to
deliver materiel and technology to counter strategic threats. Now that
the global economy is struggling, access to financing is crucial in
nations faced with fiscal concerns. In certain cases, the initiative
taken by various countries to provide competitive financing makes their
offerings more palatable to national parliaments. This is often the case
even when the militaries want to build a relationship with the United
States. [If the United States does not have the means to make
competitive offers, then it stands at a disadvantage versus
competitors.]{.underline}

https://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/for-a-strong-defense-keep-manufacturing-strong-098009

[As the past decade has shown, the United States can be quickly drawn
into conflicts around the world. To be prepared, our country **must
maintain a strong and skilled defense manufacturing industry** to
support the production of the equipment our troops need. But **this
defense base and the skilled jobs it provides are in grave
danger**.]{.underline}

[Between 1998 and 2010, the country lost 57,000 manufacturing facilities
and 6 million manufacturing jobs. If this trend continues, there is a
very real risk that we will **permanently lose the skills** required to
make]{.underline} much-needed [equipment for the]{.underline} U.S.
[military]{.underline} and will need to look overseas for suppliers. As
former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned earlier this year, "[The
last]{.underline} damn [thing we need if we face a crisis is
to]{.underline} somehow [contract out that responsibility to another
country. So **we have to maintain the core industrial base that we need.
The skills are essential to our ability to maintain a strong national
defense**."]{.underline}

A prime example of this danger to both our economy and national security
is the threatened shutdown of the Bradley Industrial Base, consisting of
the York, Pa., facility where BAE Systems manufactures the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle and the suppliers that support the program. Built to
protect and transport troops, the armored vehicle is the workhorse of
the U.S. Army and the embodiment of American defense industrial base
know-how and engineering: The vehicle's advanced aluminum armor and
weapons systems are produced by 7,000 skilled workers in 586 businesses
across 44 states.

Now, in an attempt to modernize the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the Army
is shifting funding away from Bradley Industrial Base, which in turn
will force a closure of the base's production and supply chain as early
as 2014 and lasting at least three years. With production halted, the
businesses that make up the Bradley Industrial Base will be unable to
employ the highly skilled workers who produce the specialized parts that
keep these vehicles running. [Thousands of workers will **lose their
jobs** and some will move on to other fields, while their **skills** ---
unique to building combat vehicles --- will become **lost or obsolete**.
As a result, our armed forces may end up going into harm's way **without
equipment manufactured** in America and ready for today's
battlefield.]{.underline}

[Since World War II, our military --- and all Americans --- have relied
on a **highly skilled, dedicated and engaged civilian defense labor
force of engineers, designers, welders, electricians, machinists and
pipe fitters**]{.underline}. Like a well-prepared combat team, [this
labor force --- nearly 625,000 people --- is continuously training in
order to maintain their **technological superiority**. As new
technologies are developed to address the **ever-changing threats** from
our enemy, this labor force acquires new skills to **keep pace and meet
the military's needs**]{.underline}. Now [these workers, the products
they make, the incomes their families and communities depend on and
America's ability to defend itself are all **at risk.**]{.underline}

As a nation, we must make it a priority to ensure the strength of the
Army's combat vehicle program and the skilled defense industrial base
jobs that support this crucial capability. The Army can help the Bradley
Industrial Base in the near term simply by spending the \$288 million
provided last year to allow industry to perform its requirements, which
ensure that older vehicles are upgraded with the latest technology our
troops need. In the longer term, [the Army should work with industry to
ensure that our troops can meet the missions they might face, while
providing industry with the stability to sustain the skilled jobs needed
to respond to **future threats**.]{.underline}

[Dwindling budgets]{.underline} and the desire for short-term financial
gains [are **threatening America's "arsenal of democracy" and with it
our economy**]{.underline}. The skilled men and women of the defense
manufacturing industry do work that allows us to fly the red, white and
blue, and they must not be pink-slipped. [Equipping our military is too
important to outsource --- our economy, our national security and our
fellow Americans count on it.]{.underline}

## Weaponitis

#### De-emphasizing weapons is a form of anti-weapon 'weaponitis' itself \-- The US will gladly announce a de-emphasized weapon posture in order to perpetuate more military dominance. The impact is US military domination, belligerent nonproliferation pressure, and otherization

**Bond-Graham, 09** \-\-- Darwin Bond-Graham, Sociology @ University of
California Santa Barbara, Foreign Policy In Focus contributor, Foreign
Policy In Focus, 1/15, "Anti-nuclear Nuclearism",
http://www.fpif.org/articles/anti-nuclear_nuclearism, JGS

The Obama administration is likely to continue a policy that we call
"anti-nuclear nuclearism." Anti-nuclear nuclearism is a foreign and
military policy that relies upon overwhelming U.S. power, including the
nuclear arsenal, but makes rhetorical and even some substantive
commitments to disarmament, however vaguely defined. Anti-nuclear
nuclearism thrives as a school of thought in several think tanks that
have long influenced foreign policy choices related to global nuclear
forces. Even the national nuclear weapons development labs in New Mexico
and California have been avid supporters and crafters of of it. As a
policy, **[anti-nuclear nuclearism is designed to ensure U.S. nuclear
and military dominance by rhetorically calling for what has long been
derided as a naïve ideal: global nuclear disarmament]{.underline}**.
Unlike past forms of nuclearism, it de-emphasizes the offensive nature
of the U.S. arsenal. **[Instead of promoting the U.S. stockpile as a
strategic deterrence or umbrella for U.S. and allied forces, it
prioritizes an aggressive diplomatic and military campaign of
nonproliferation. Nonproliferation efforts are aimed entirely at other
states, especially non-nuclear nations with suspected weapons programs,
or states that can be coerced and attacked under the pretense that they
possess nuclear weapons or a development program]{.underline}** (e.g.
Iraq in 2003). [Effectively pursuing this kind of belligerent
nonproliferation regime requires half-steps toward cutting the U.S.
arsenal further, and at least rhetorically recommitting the United
States to international treaties such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT). It requires a fig leaf that the United States isn't
developing new nuclear weapons, and that it is slowly disarming and
de-emphasizing its nuclear arsenal. By these means the United States has
tried to avoid the charge of hypocrisy, even though it has designed and
built newly modified weapons with qualitatively new capacities over the
last decade and a half. Meanwhile, U.S. leaders have allowed for and
even promoted a mass proliferation of nuclear energy and material,
albeit under the firm control of the nuclear weapons states, with the
United States at the top of this pile.]{.underline} Many disarmament
proponents were elated last year when four extremely prominent cold
warriors --- George P. Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and Sam
Nunn --- announced in a series of op-eds their commitment to \"a world
free of nuclear weapons.\" Strange bedfellows indeed for the cause. Yet
the fine print of their plan, published by the Hoover Institute and
others since then, represents the anti-nuclear nuclearist platform to a
tee. It's a conspicuous yet merely rhetorical commitment to a world
without nuclear weapons. These four elder statesmen have said what many
U.S. elites have rarely uttered: that abolition is both possible and
desirable. However, [the anti-nuclear posture in their policy proposal
comes to bear only on preventing non-nuclear states from going nuclear,
or else preventing international criminal conspiracies from
proliferating weapons technologies and nuclear materials for use as
instruments of non-state terror. In other words, **it's about other
people\'s nuclear weapons, not the 99% of materials and arms possessed
by the United States and other established nuclear
powers.**]{.underline} **[This position emphasizes an anti-nuclear
politics entirely for what it means for the rest of the world ---
securing nuclear materials and preventing other states from going
nuclear or further developing their existing arsenals. U.S.
responsibility to disarm remains in the distant future, unaddressed as a
present imperative.]{.underline}**

#### Normative discourse in this round depicts [weapons]{.underline} as the cause of insecurity \-\-- this "weapons paradigm" drastically exaggerates the role weapons play in causing violence

**Schwartz and Derber 93** \-- William A. Schwartz, a professor of
property law at Yeshiva University\'s Cardozo School of Law, and Charles
Derber, Professor of Sociology at Boston College, THE NUCLEAR SEDUCTION:
WHY THE ARMS RACE DOESN'T MATTER- AND WHAT DOES, University of
California Press, 1993. P. 2.

Public issues generally develop a \"culture,\" a consensus about the key
questions, the level of analysis, and the language of debate. Since
these assumptions are shared, they rarely come up for discussion. **[The
common perspective that guides discourse on nuclear war and peace is
what we call the "weapons paradigm." It magnifies the importance of the
weapons themselves far beyond their real significance. It views weapons
as the basic source of security or insecurity, power or weakness, peace
or war. It pegs the arms race as the problem and some change in that
race as the solution. If nuclear weapons were like conventional ones,
then their]{.underline}** number and technical characteristics would of
course matter. But nuclear weapons are different. They are so powerful
that both superpowers long ago acquired the means to utterly destroy
each other along with much of the rest of the planet**. [For decades the
arms race and arms control have changed only thwe number of times that
we can bounce the radiating rubble of the world.]{.underline}**

#### Their exclusive focus on the 'interconnection' of weapons serves to obfuscate and naturalize more pernicious forms of state violence \-\-- collapses the reformist potential of their demand Beier 6 \-- J. Marshall Assistant Professor of Political Science, McMaster University, McMaster University, Disarming Politics: Arms, Agency, and the (Post)Politics of Disarmament Advocacy, Canadian Political Science Association, http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2007/Beier.pdf

Novel though it may be, the re-siting of agency taking place at the
heart of the RMA does not bring subjectivity fully into view. **[Claims
made]{.underline}** on behalf of PGMs have yet to **[go so far as to
suggest that the weapons decide on the terms of their own use -- though
the crucial role of those who actually despatch them is mystified, it is
not denied.]{.underline} [Key to how imaginaries founded in and
sustained by briefing videos and like (re)presentations depoliticize
war, then, is that the effect has been to cast weapons as agents, but
without completing the anthropomorphic turn that would inscribe them
also as sites of ethical responsibility. However, this does not merely
imply a bifurcation of the subject, the sum of which is nevertheless as
visible as divisible. Rather, the severed whole has become something
less than the sum of its parts in the alienation of the purposive
subject from the operant site of agency: a crucial element of whole
subjectivity is lost to the extent that a deep ambivalence about
responsibility is engendered]{.underline}.** A cruise missile, it should
be remembered, intends nothing. Our gaze is therefore fixed on a
weapon-agent that can be no more than a grammatical subject separated
from ethical subjecthood in what appears at first as a profoundly
depoliticizing move. But more than this, the mystified site of ethical
subjecthood is insulated from responsibility for any dire consequences
that might be visited upon noncombatants. Read through the imaginaries
of the RMA, such events become the exceptions in which something has
gone awry. ['Responsibility' consequently lacks for an intelligible
tether to either the weapon-agent or the fragmented subjectivity
associated with it, but does not fully become a free floating signifier
since it may yet plausibly attach to the victims]{.underline}.15
Although turned to a more progressive purpose, the rhetorical/discursive
strategies of the landmine ban effect and work through a similar
disturbance of sites of responsibility. The success of the mine ban
movement owes in no small measure to the marking of antipersonnel
landmines as 'bad' weapons -- a move that has enabled even states that
have widely used mines to join in denouncing them as a humanitarian
scourge without simultaneously repudiating recourse to militarized
violence more generally. At the campaign level and with the specific
practical objective of securing the broadest possible ban on landmines,
this was a very well conceived approach. Indeed, had this strategy not
been adopted, it is unlikely that the movement would have swayed many --
if any -- states to the cause. But practically expedient though it may
be, it is also contingent on putting responsibility out of sight. Like
errant cruise missiles, landmines intend nothing. What makes them bad,
then, speaks not of disposition, but rather a technological limitation
resulting in an objective property of indiscriminacy. While this might
at first seem suggestive of the need for a technological solution, the
mine ban movement quite rightly worked to foreclose the possibility of
recourse to 'smart mines' in deference to the goal of a complete
prohibition. [This would appear to mark it quite decidedly apart from
the war- enabling technologies of the RMA and their part in refashioning
the bases of legitimacy in contemporary warfare. The mystification of
responsibility so crucial to the ban, however, reveals some disturbing
points of intersection.]{.underline} On first gloss, the approach of the
mine ban movement seems quite clearly to disavow any recourse to
'better' technology as a fix for landmine indiscriminacy. The importance
of this cannot be overstated since, as has been the case with the RMA,
distinguishing between 'good' and 'bad' weapons raises the specter of a
like distinction in terms of the conduct of those who use them -- a
distinction not always well sustained by the actual consequences of
their use. In refusing to concede that some mines might be less
pernicious than others, therefore, the movement has simultaneously
denied all bases of legitimacy in mine use that might otherwise have
been claimed by the technologically advantaged. But things become rather
more problematic when considered from without the narrow context of the
landmines issue. While the rhetorical casting of mines as bad proved a
remarkably effective strategy in pursuit of a ban, i[t only makes sense
if it in fact *is* imagined that there are somewhere 'good'
weapons.]{.underline} Since it is not killing per se but killing with
landmines that is rendered indefensible, the use of other presumably
more discriminating weapons is lent a certain legitimacy it might not
otherwise have enjoyed. And this is revealing of the important sense in
which the core claims of the mine ban contribute to the reproduction of
essential ideational bases of the 'new American way of war.' Inviting
none of the cynicism about motives that might have attached to a wholly
state-led initiative, the central involvement of civil society actors in
the mine ban movement -- well known and respected peace and human rights
advocacy groups among them -- both naturalizes andvalorizes a much
larger constellation of claims to meaningful discriminacy, whether overt
or subsumed. Pressing for a ban on landmines thus involved the complete
disaggregation of this one issue not only from peace activism in general
but from the more particular realm of disarmament advocacy as well,
parceling it off in such a way as to suggest that there are more
effective ways to do the sorts of things landmines are intended to do.
Although the success of the campaign is often tied to the support given
it by the late Princess of Wales, that really speaks more to its public
face and the winning of popular opinion. Much more important in making
the case to states was a group of retired high-ranking US military
officers -- including General Norman Schwarzkopf -- who backed the ban
on grounds that landmines, besides resulting in unintended dire human
consequences, were no longer appropriate to contemporary warfare and
could even frustrate its prosecution; other weapons, they argued, could
do the job much more effectively.16 Espoused by the general who came to
international fame alongside Gulf War briefing videos, this position is
inseparable from popular imaginaries about PGMs and surgical strikes --
indeed, its very intelligibility owes to them[. And while it would
certainly be too much to suggest that unequally shifting arbiters of
legitimacy in war are sustained by this form of disarmament
advocacy,]{.underline} the mine ban movement's foregrounding of the dire
human consequences of indiscriminacy nevertheless merges neatly with the
imaginaries of the RMA. In combination with this, the movement's
enthusiastic endorsement of Schwarzkopf's position is telling of the
post-political frame in which efforts to ban landmines have been
confined. As Žižek (1999) describes it, [post-politics is, in essence,
the obliteration of the political through the reduction of the overall
demand of a particular group to just that demand. That is to say, it is
the reduction of a call for better working conditions, for example, to
that very specific issue alone, divesting it of its politicized content
as part of a broader push for social justice and therefore also
divesting it of the potential t]{.underline}o, as Žižek (1999: 204) puts
it, '[function as a metaphoric condensation of\...opposition\...so that
the protest]{.underline} [is no longer actually just about that demand,
but about the universal dimension that resonates in that particular
demand.' This is key to an understanding of politics as something more
than 'administration of social matters']{.underline} -- for Žižek (1999:
199; emphasis in original), 'the political act
**[(intervention)]{.underline}** proper **[is not simply something that
exists well within the framework of the existing relations, but
something that changes the very framework that determines how things
work.]{.underline}**' Post-politics takes place within the status quo
framework, containing particular demands -- even to the extent of
answering them -- in such a way as to prevent their 'metaphoric
universalization' (Žižek: 204). The rhetorical/discursive disaggregation
of landmines from state practices of organized violence more broadly
finds it on just such a post-political terrain, severing at least this
particular exercise of disarmament advocacy from any appeal against
militarism writ large. [**The central validity claims of the ban, having
cast landmines as the agents of dire human consequences, also divorce it
from appeals against the killing of noncombatants with other
weapons**,]{.underline} including errant PGMs. At base, the essence of
the case advanced by the movement to ban them was that antipersonnel
landmines are bad weapons because they do not discriminate -- that is
the position that ultimately accounts for the remarkable success of the
campaign to ban them. [But the idea of bad weapons, as opposed to bad
practices, has some important implications and effects. First, and most
fundamentally, it confines disarmament advocacy to a decidedly
post-political terrain of engagement whereon it is possible to imagine a
ban on landmines without in any way disturbing the militarized practices
that led to the circumstance that there are presently more than a
hundred million mines lying in wait in conflict- and post-conflict zones
around the world.]{.underline} Indeed, militarized practices are not
only moved off the critical agenda, but are actually reinforced to the
extent that the crux of the case turns on the idea that landmines are
problematic for their *unintended* consequences. [That has the effect of
reconfirming as legitimate both their *intended* effects and the broader
purposes they had been intended to serve by those effects. The demand
that landmines be banned is therefore reduced to just that particular
demand. And perhaps the best indication of this is that the movement has
been unable to parlay its success with landmines into a much hoped-for
ban on small arms and light weapons.]{.underline} But what is perhaps
the most troubling implication of the mine ban rhetoric follows from
this: **[agency is shifted to weapons themselves]{.underline}** in
casting landmines **[as 'bad' and as the site of responsibility for the
dire human consequences that have been associated with
them]{.underline}**. That mystifies the site of responsibility such that
when a 'good' weapon -- a cruise missile, for example -- hits other than
its intended target questions about responsibility stop at the weapon
itself and can be resolved by pointing to a malfunction. In this way,
responsibility is contained and managed. [The broader significance of
the shifting of agency toward weapons comes more fully to light via the
rhetorics of the RMA and the imaginaries it sustains: in particular,
well popularized understandings of smart bombs and surgical strikes. The
whole discourse of 'smart bombs' also ascribes individualized agency to
weapons. That they are not actually smart matters little when popular
imaginaries take at face value the discursive and aesthetic renderings
together with attending rhetorics. In instances of implausibly deniable
'collateral damage' the weapon is at fault because it has been rendered
an autonomous agent. Similarly placing blame for dire human consequences
on weapons, mine ban rhetoric upholds the viability of
this]{.underline}. In common with the landmines taboo, the new American
way of war turns also on the matter of meaningful discrimination between
combatants and noncombatants and of who, or, more precisely, what fails
to discriminate. All that is unique, important, and laudable about the
Ottawa Process raises urgent questions about disarmament advocacy. What
seems clear is that the rhetorical/discursive and aesthetic renderings
of the RMA are key to understanding both the successes and the limits of
the campaign to ban landmines and, with it, something of the future of
disarmament advocacy more broadly. The extent to which it stands as a
workable model for future initiatives would seem to be contingent upon
the degree to which its success owes to the nexus between a re- emergent
discriminacy norm and the advent of weapon-agents. As the frustrated
hopes for a follow-on success in the area of small arms and light
weapons suggest, this might not be easily replicable. In any event, it
would seem to fix quite restrictive limits on the range of weapons that
might be singled out for prohibition, whilst ironically depopulating war
once more by objectifying victims and confounding the easy
identification of whole subject positions whence issue the injuring
practices of war. Confined to a post-political terrain of engagement,
the most profound limitation of the approach taken in the landmine ban
resides in the forfeiture of any thoroughgoing critique of militarized
practices. As noted above, it is probably too much to say that the mine
ban movement's adoption of weapon-agent discursive strategies played any
significant part in preparing the ideational ground for the sanitized
rhetorics of discriminacy in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is, however,
implicated in the very imaginaries that sustain those rhetorics and may,
no less, have been enabled by them. Besides mystifying sites of agency
and responsibility, this undergirds claims to meaningful discriminacy
that have become an increasingly important part of cultivating
legitimacy in recourse to war. What is more, it also effectively
abandons those bodies marked as combatants, unlawful or otherwise. And
while it is widely accepted that combatants, by virtue of their direct
participation in Clausewitz's 'other means,' enjoy no special right of
protection, this may be to lose sight once more of the ineluctable fact
of war's embeddedness in broader socio-political contexts and practices.
It is imperative, from this perspective, to bear in mind that the
ascription 'combatant' may be no less socially and politically
contingent than that of 'unlawful combatant.' We are thus enjoined to
consider the significance of conscription and the unequal social
determinants characteristic and enabling of much recruitment. These are
just some of the thornier implications of undertaking efforts toward
disarmament on the terms of the RMA and new ways of war -- implications
that call for careful reflection on the fundamental values and ultimate
objectives of activist and advocacy work in this important area. Such
are the disarming politics of our moment.

We also must take back our politics from the technocrats and
professionals, people with little to sell us except how to sell. Their
language of "branding" and "entrepreneurship" pervades the political
culture, reaching now far into the so-called "nonprofit" sector and even
down to community groups. Far too many mouth the words without thinking
about what they mean. They are in fact expressions of the corporate
attitudes and practices that have pushed our economy into bankruptcy and
our ecosphere to the brink of disaster. The path to a more just and
peaceful world will be one of cooperation and solidarity, not more
competition. The road to Martin Luther King's revolution in values will
not be "branded" or advertised. We face this dangerous and difficult
moment without much **[in the way of recent analysis and discussion that
helps us understand the relationship between nuclear weapons and the
structures of a global society]{.underline}** and politics that are in
crisis and are changing fast. In these circumstances, [**we must discard
much of the "expert" analysis, beginning again with what we know about
nuclear weapons, what every human being can know about
them**.]{.underline} As the Russell- Einstein Manifesto put it over a
half century ago, "remember your humanity and forget the rest."
**[Nuclear weapons represent the threat of unlimited violence, and of
willingness to sacrifice the people for the State.]{.underline} [The
decision to acquire nuclear weapons raises to the level of an absolute
the willingness of those in power to risk all of us, and everything, to
achieve their ends]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} And it is a decision
that in every case has first been taken in secret, with neither the
means nor ends open to question, much less choice, by the vast majority
of those affected. [**Both the decision to acquire nuclear weapons and
the manner in which it always is taken should tell us that the "state"
that we live in significant ways does not "represent" us. We must
understand that it represents someone, or something, else-- and that our
very survival may depend on finding out who or what, and doing something
about it**.]{.underline} This is what it means for the state we live in
to have nuclear weapons, at the simplest and most basic level. It is in
this context that **[educating ourselves and others about the terrible
realities of nuclear warfare can have positive meaning. This must not,
however, be the end of the discussion, but the beginning. Stopping here,
we risk contributing to a climate of fear and
hopelessness]{.underline}** that can demoralize those we hope to
organize, **[and that can reinforce the fearbased ideologies of those
who offer more armaments as the only "practical" form of "security" in a
dangerous world. Starting here, we can begin to understand the violence
that sustains both stratified societies and the inequities of the global
system as a whole.]{.underline}**

will ignore their appeal while they develop large, deadly weapons.**

Nuclear disarmament is a key theme of the Australian peace movement.
There are, for example, the various People for Nuclear Disarmament
groups, the Nuclear Disarmament Party, and the major Nuclear Disarmament
Conference held in Melbourne in August 1985. I argue [that **it is
dangerously narrow to focus so much on nuclear weapons, and also to
focus so much on disarmament.** The basic problem with focusing on
nuclear weapons is that they are only one product of the war system.
**The history of modem warfare is one of recurrent technical innovation
to increase the killing power of weaponry. This process has been
routinised in the past century through the heavy sponsorship of science
and technology by the state. In effect, much of the knowledge and skills
produced and used by science and technology is tied to the military aims
of separate states.**]{.underline}\[1\] [It so happens that nuclear
weapons are currently the most prominent of technological threats to
human life. But **the driving force behind the development of weapons of
mass destruction is the state-technology system, not the weapons
themselves.**]{.underline} As a potential solution to the problem of
mass killing in warfare, the locus on nuclear weapons has several
limitations: The killing power of conventional weapons has been
increasing at a great rate for decades. A large-scale conventional war
between major industrialised powers could kill many tens or even
hundreds of millions of people**. [Even if all nuclear weapons were
dismantled tomorrow, the capacity to produce new nuclear weapons would
remain]{.underline}**. With technological advances in uranium isotope
separation, in a few years time it may be possible for small states and
non-state groups to produce nuclear weapons without great difficulty or
expense. Chemical and especially biological weapons have the potential
to kill large numbers of people. Future biological weapons could easily
pose as great a threat as present nuclear weapons. Quite a few people
realise that getting rid of nuclear weapons is not enough, but
nevertheless think that concentrating on nuclear weapons is essential.
One view is that cutting back on nuclear weapons should be seen as only
the first stage of efforts against war. The problem with this is that
most people, including members of peace groups, get caught up with the
immediate demands. The peace movement in the late 1950s and early 1960s
made the cessation of nuclear testing in the atmosphere a major demand,
with the result that the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963 took a lot of
the wind out of the movement. Another stance is that the threat posed by
nuclear weapons is so enormous and unprecedented that focussing on
nuclear weapons is necessary to buy time for any other social action: if
there is a nuclear war we will not be around to worry about poverty or
sexism. In response I would argue that there is no automatic reason why
\'buying time\' is best achieved through a narrow concern about nuclear
weapons. The effectiveness of social movements does not derive simply
from the size of the threat to human life that they are protesting
about, but rather from a whole range of factors, including the
possibility of reforms, the bandwagon effect and the organisation of the
movement. Another argument is that a wider alliance can be built by
focussing on nuclear weapons and not alienating people by bringing up
other demands. The problem with that case is reliance on the lowest
common denominator makes it difficult to achieve anything more than
pious declarations. The heads of all the major weapons states tell us
that they are in favour of \'peace\', but that doesn\'t achieve
anything. The major problem with the concentration on nuclear weapons is
that it encourages a technical fix approach such as the nuclear freeze
or other agreements made by governments. The evidence is overwhelming
that arms negotiations hold little potential for changing the war
system, irrespective of popular pressure applied to governments.\[2\]
Quite a number of historical examples show the limitations for social
movements of making demands which are too narrow. For example, the
progressive movement in the United States around the turn of the century
was a powerful reform movement. One of its major concerns was the abuses
perpetrated by large corporations: monopoly, exploitation, etc. The
focus was on large corporations, and the solution sought was
\'trust-busting\', in other words, using government intervention to
break up the monopolies. As in the case of nuclear disarmament
negotiations, there was more sound than action from politicians who took
up the progressive cause. But the basic limitation of the approach was
seeing the problem in the trusts rather than deeper in the capitalist
system. It hardly needs mentioning that although some monopolies were
broken up at the time, the size and power of US-based transnational
corporations is greater than ever today. A similar difficulty faced the
first wave of the feminist movement when around the turn of the
twentieth century it made achieving the vote for women the major target.
Barring women from voting was useful but - as later events showed - not
essential to continued male domination. After the feminist movement
achieved its immediate aim of the vote, it went into decline for
decades. This is the great danger of focussing too much on
\'achievable\' reforms. \'Disarmament\' is the other side of the central
attention placed on nuclear disarmament. Disarmament is normally
conceived as a reversal of the armament process and as something that is
undertaken by governments. The major limitation here, once again, is
that concentrating on disarmament does not address the driving forces
behind the war system. If the system of states, with each state founded
on claims to a monopoly on \'legitimate\' violence, is at the basis of
the war system, then it is futile to expect to turn back the armament
process by appealing to the rationality or political concerns of state
elites.\[3\] And yet that is exactly what the Australian peace movement
has attempted to do. The main strategy of the Australian peace
movement - inasmuch as a main strategy can be perceived - is to apply
pressure to the Australian government to push for cutting free of the
nuclear weapons connection. The major rallies have been largely aimed at
getting as many people on the streets as possible, to impress the public
and the government with the breadth of concern. Efforts to support the
Democrats or the Nuclear Disarmament Party are designed to apply
electoral pressure on the government to sever its links to the US
nuclear system. The trouble with this is that the peace movement has no
alternative to military defence which it can proceed to implement
itself. By focussing on nuclear disarmament, the movement ties itself to
a \'see and plea\' approach of the sort which has failed time and time
again. Will getting millions of people into the streets force the
government to take action? There were a million in the streets of New
York in 1982. Furthermore, opinion polls show that a large majority of
US people favour a nuclear freeze. Have the US policy-makers responded?
Not in terms of the substance of their policies.

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions,
each topic contains certain key elements, although they have slightly
different functions from comparable elements of value-oriented
propositions. 1[. An **agent doing the acting \-\--"The United States"**
in "The United States should adopt a policy of free trade." Like the
object of evaluation in a proposition of value, the agent is the subject
of the sentence. 2**. The verb should---the first part of a verb phrase
that urges action**. 3. An **action verb to follow should in the
should-verb combination**. For example, should adopt here means to put a
program or policy into action though governmental means. 4. A
**specification of directions or a limitation of the action desired.**
The phrase free trade, for example, gives direction and limits to the
topic, which would, for example, eliminate consideration of increasing
tariffs, discussing diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate
commerce. Propositions of policy deal with future action. Nothing has
yet occurred. The **entire debate is about whether something ought to
occur. What you agree to do, then, when you accept the affirmative side
in such a debate is to offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an

[Most major elements of U.S. defense policy are on reasonably solid
ground, despite innumerable squabbles among experts over many of the
details]{.underline}. Through­out the post--Cold War era, some variant of
a two-war planning framework (with caveats) has enjoyed bipartisan
support and should continue to do so for many years to come. [Forward
presence and engagement in [East
Asia](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/east-asia),
[Europe](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/europe), and the [Middle
East](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/middle-east) remain
compelling pillars of U.S. national security strategy]{.underline}.
[Robust research-and-development programs continue to be supported, as
does an unparalleled intelligence com­munity]{.underline}. The Defense
Department's procurement budget---the first victim of budgetary
austerity in the 1990s and in the early years of this century---is once
again relatively healthy. [Pentagon leaders are spurring innovation, and
the men and women of today's armed forces display high standards of
professionalism, expertise, and experience]{.underline}. Yet there are
also areas of concern. Excess base capacity remains a problem. The
navy's fleet and the army are too small, and current budget trajectories
imply further cuts rather than increases. And the scale of some hugely
expensive weapons programs in the pipeline or on the drawing boards,
such as the F-35 fighter jet and some new nuclear weapons, needs to be
reassessed. **[The challenge for the next president will thus be how to
build on the strengths, address the problems, and chart a course for
contin­uing to maintain U.S. military dominance in a strategic
environment that never stops evolving]{.underline}**. **[The national
interests that the U.S. military needs to advance remain constant:
protecting the homeland; safeguarding U.S. citizens at home and abroad;
and ensuring the security of U.S. allies, the global economy, and
international order more generally.]{.underline}** These days, [threats
to those interests come from five sources: great powers (such as China
and Russia), extremist nonstate actors (such as al Qaeda; the Islamic
State, or ISIS; and the Taliban), rogue states (such as Iran and North
Korea), pandemics and environmental turbulence, and developments in
advanced technology that could increase U.S. vulner­abilities (especially
those related to cyberspace, space, and weapons of mass
destruction)]{.underline}. Fortunately, the United States has many
resources to draw on as it prepares for these threats, even beyond its
military forces. The country's high-tech and innovative sectors are the
best in the world. It has solid economic fundamentals, including a
gradually growing population base, the world's best univer­sities, and a
large market at the center of global finance and commerce. And most
important of all[, the United States leads a globe-spanning system of
alliances and partnerships that includes some 60 countries, collectively
accounting for two-thirds of global economic output and military
capacity]{.underline}. A serious defense policy, however, needs to take
into account the way war itself is changing. [True military revolu­tions
are relatively rare, as even major changes usually occur gradually, over
decades]{.underline}. But there is clearly one such revolution now in
process, perhaps halfway along: in airpower, particularly in the effects
of precision ordnance combined with the vast increase of intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnais­sance (ISR) systems on the contemporary
battlefield. Harbingers of this revolution were apparent as far back as
1982, in the effectiveness of the French-made Exocet missiles used by
the Argentinian military against British warships during the [Falklands
War](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/argentina/1982-09-01/reconsiderations-war-falkland-islands-1982).
Around the same time, NATO put forward the concept of AirLand Battle,
which envisioned using new types of advanced munitions to precisely
strike critical targets behind the frontlines in the event of a conflict
with the Warsaw Pact. (Hearkening back to the "first offset"---NATO's
reliance on nuclear weapons to counter its foes' large land
armies---some called this the "second offset," relying on the high-tech
quality of its conventional forces to counter its foes' quantitative
superiority.) The public began to take notice of these developments
during the Gulf War in 1990--91, as laser-guided bomb­ing played as well
on television as it did on the battlefield. GPS-guided bombs arrived a
few years later, and they were eventually followed by armed drones. [All
these American weapons can now be employed in vastly greater quantities
through "sensor-shooter loops" that take advantage of remarkable
advances in reconnaissance systems, such as the "unblinking eye" of many
dozens of drones and satellite-based communi­cations that share
targeting, video, and critical data across the military in real
time.]{.underline} Precision-guided bombs accounted for about ten
percent of the ordnance used in the Gulf War. In recent conflicts, they
have accounted for about 90 percent, with a dramatic impact on the
course of battle. As a result, Pentagon officials now talk of a "third
offset"---the hope, championed by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and
Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, among others, that it will be
possible to rely on modern-day ISR and precision assets to counter, say,
larger Chinese missile, aircraft, ship, and submarine forces in the
waters of the western Pacific. For all this progress, however, there are
limits to what standoff warfare and advanced technology can achieve by
themselves. To make precision bombing effective, for example, targets
need to be located accurately---something that can be difficult if those
targets are in cities, forests, or jungles, or are concealed or
underground. Moreover, advanced sensor and communications networks may
prove fragile when fighting tech­nologically sophisticated adversaries.
Land warfare also remains complex, particularly when fighting in cities
or against an adversary trying to hide or disguise what is being done
(such as Russia's [seizure of
Crimea](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/why-putin-took-crimea)
in 2014 using "little green men"---mysterious soldiers in unmarked
uniforms). Future war fighting could be complicated by the introduction
of chemical, electromagnetic-pulse, or even nuclear weapons or take
place in a war zone affected by pandemic infectious disease. And it is
not hard to conjure up scenarios in which U.S. forces would be
responsible for helping restore order in a chaotic environment marked by
the breakdown of complex systems that usually provide essential services
to millions of people. Given all of this, [how should the next
administration handle defense policy? By building on existing policies
and concentrating on preparing the army for multiple missions,
continuing the navy's rebalance of attention to the Pacific, countering
China and Russia, and maintaining adequate resources to support a robust
force]{.underline}. After long, difficult wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,
[some critics have argued that the entire notion of attempting to
prepare U.S. ground forces for complex missions beyond conventional
combat is a fruitless or even counterproductive exercise.]{.underline}
Reprising the army's attitude in the wake of the Vietnam War, when it
eschewed counterinsurgency and focused instead on high-end maneuver
warfare and the NATO--Warsaw Pact face-off, they favor developing a
force with a more limited orientation. The Obama administration's 2012
Defense Strategic Guidance report, for example, stated that although
U.S. forces would "retain and continue to refine the lessons learned,
expertise, and special­ized capabilities that have been developed over
the past ten years of counterinsur­gency and stability operations in Iraq
and Afghanistan," they would "no longer be sized to conduct large-scale,
prolonged stability operations." Partly as a result of this logic,
today's active-duty U.S. Army has been cut by almost 100,000 in recent
years, to 470,000 soldiers. That is fewer than the number fielded in the
mid- to late 1990s. Under current plans, moreover, the army would
decline further, to 450,000 by 2018, and some key Pentagon officials
have advocated cuts to 400,000 or below. [This reasoning---which was
repeated in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review---is
flawed.]{.underline} [Washington might declare its lack of interest in
large-scale land operations and stabilization missions, but history
suggests that eventually it will find itself engaging in them
never­theless, driven by the pull of events and the logic of turbulent
situations on the ground]{.underline}. The 2014 Army Operating Concept,
Win in a Complex World, wisely recognizes **[that the current and future
army must be ready to handle a wide range of possible
challenges]{.underline}**. It accords with the notion that the modern
soldier must in effect be a pentathlete, with skills across a wide range
of domains that apply to many possible types of operations. The document
builds on earlier concepts, such as the belief of General Charles
Krulak, former commandant of the Marine Corps, in preparing troops for a
"three-block war," in which U.S. forces might be providing relief in one
part of a city, keeping the peace in a second, and fighting intensively
against a deter­mined foe in a third. And it reflects awareness of what
Raymond Odierno, former chief of staff of the army, has called the
increasing "velocity of insta­bility" in the world, with U.S. forces
frequently participating simultaneously in a broad range of contingency
oper­ations in several different theaters---everything from combat to
deterrence to the provision of humanitarian aid. The George W. Bush
administration took office averse to missions that smacked of nation
building, but eventually it came to understand these realities. A
Pentagon directive issued in 2005 stated, "Stability operations are a
core U.S. military mission...They shall be given priority comparable to
combat operations." A decade on, that remains a sensible approach, while
recognizing the imper­ative of having host-nation forces and coalition
partners do as much as is absolutely possible to keep the United States'
commitment in blood and treasure to a minimum---and thus sustainable
over what are likely to be generational struggles. During its first
term, the Obama administration put forward the notion of [rebalancing
U.S. power and
attention](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/why-putin-took-crimea)
toward the Asia-Pacific, reflecting the region's increasing significance
to U.S. interests. This sensible proposal met with broad bipartisan
support and should be fleshed out and reinforced in coming years. To
date, however, the Pentagon's moves in this direction have been
rela­tively modest in scale, with a net shifting of assets to the
Asia-Pacific theater of no more than \$10 billion to \$15 billion worth
out of the approximately \$600 billion annual defense budget, by our
estimates. If coupled with continued diplomatic efforts and economic
measures such as passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership---not just a
trade agreement but also a crucial signal of U.S. commit­ment to the
region in general---such moves should suffice, at least for now. But it
will take a healthy, predictable defense budget to fund even moves of
this scale, and anything less would fall well short of what the
strategic challenge requires. No "pivot" to the Pacific is needed or
even truly possible given the United States' other interests and
commitments. Nevertheless, the case for reenergizing the nation's
emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region is powerful. [**North Korea remains
a serious threat, with erratic and bellicose behavior continuing under
its current leader, Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has now [detonated four
nuclear
weapons](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2013-02-13/pyongyangs-nuclear-logic)
and apparently continues to expand its arsenal and its missile-delivery
capabilities.** China, meanwhile, has established itself as a near peer
of the United States by many economic and manufacturing measures, has
the second-largest military budget in the world now, and could be
spending half as much as the United States on its armed forces within a
few years, with much lower personnel costs and far fewer regions on
which to focus]{.underline}. Its stocks of advanced combat aircraft,
advanced submarines, other naval vessels, and ballistic and cruise
missiles have grown enormously, and the majority of its newer main
platforms in these categories are gradually approaching parity with the
United States. Factoring in everything from aircraft carriers to the
latest planes and submarines, the U.S. military still has a major lead
over the People's Liberation Army, and the United States' total stock of
modern military equipment is worth perhaps ten times that of China's.
[But the overwhelming superiority once enjoyed by the United States is
largely gone. The bulk of the U.S. military's rebalance to the Pacific
region involves the navy.]{.underline} In a 2012 speech, then Secretary
of Defense Leon Panetta stated that by 2020, Washington would focus 60
percent of its naval assets on the Pacific and only 40 percent on the
Atlantic. But most of those ships will be based in the United States,
and many could still deploy to the Persian Gulf from their new home
ports on the Pacific coast. So the scale of the rebalance is limited,
and the changes in overseas basing arrangements associated with it are
modest, as well. Only four small littoral combat ships, for example, are
currently planned to be based in Singapore, along with perhaps two to
three more attack submarines based in Guam. Other services are in on the
act, too, but even more modestly. The army has created a four-star
subordinate command at Pacific Command, in Hawaii, to strengthen its
role in the region (although it may not get the funds to continue it).
The Marine Corps will rotate up to 2,500 marines at a time to Darwin,
Australia. New port and basing arrange­ments are being established with
Vietnam and the Philippines. In 2013, then Secretary of Defense Chuck
Hagel stated that 60 percent of many air force assets will also focus on
the Asia-Pacific region, although their home airfields may not need to
change much to make that possible. And regional missile defenses are
being buttressed somewhat, as well. Yet the success of the rebalance
will depend not just on how many U.S. forces are deployed to the region
but also on how they are used. Wise recent actions in this regard
include stepped-up freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China
Sea, which challenge China's right to stake out new holdings near
man-made islands and other land features there, and the Obama
administration's public commitment to treat the group of islands known
in China as the Diaoyu and in Japan as the Senkaku as being covered by
the U.S.-Japanese security treaty. (Washington takes no position on the
rightful owner of those islands, but since they are currently
administered by Tokyo, it has agreed that they are covered by the
treaty.) As concerning as Beijing's actions have been, its recent
assertiveness amounts more to moves in a long game of chess than
preparations for some imminent war of aggression. Washington should thus
respond, but do so calmly. [The Obama administration's general policy of
patient firmness is sound and should be continued by its
successor]{.underline}, but the next administration should take care not
to allow lags between rhetoric and action, as was the case when the
United States promised to demon­strate its support for freedom of
navigation in mid-2015 but then took months to deliver on it, sending
mixed signals about its commitment. And if China continues to reclaim
and militarize islands in the South China Sea, the logical response by
Washington should be not a direct use of force but the development of
closer security ties with various states in the region, possibly
including new U.S. deployments or even bases. The 2014 Quadrennial
Defense Review was conducted before Russia's invasion and seizure of
Crimea, and like all previous post--Cold War defense reviews, it did not
consider a contingency involving the Russian Federation to be high on
the list of priorities for force planning. That was then. Now, **[some
members of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff have described Russia as their
top security concern. This makes sense, because the combination of
Russia's sheer firepower and President Vladimir Putin's [apparent
ambitions](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/russias-perpetual-geopolitics)
make it a possible threat---indeed, a potentially existential one---that
demands attention]{.underline}**. At the same time, however, perspective
is [needed. Putin is no friend of the West, nor of the smaller states
near Russia that represent challenges to his drive for regional
hegemony]{.underline}. But his moves to date have been select and
calibrated. Crimea was historically Russian, is populated by a majority
of Russian speakers, and is home to Russia's only Black Sea naval base.
And when Putin moved into Syria last fall, he did so only after having
determined that the Obama administration was keeping its own involvement
limited. His inter­vention there allowed him to shore up an old ally,
flex Russia's long-range power-projection muscles, retain Russia's only
port on the Mediterranean, and demonstrate Russia's geopolitical
impor­tance. These actions may have been cynical and reprehensible, but
they were not completely reckless or random, nor were they particularly
brutal by the standards of warfare. And they do not likely portend a
direct threat to more central NATO interests. The Obama administration
has been right to shore up its commitment to NATO, although it should go
further and increase its assistance to Ukraine, as well. Given Moscow's
provocations of the [Baltic
states](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/baltics) in recent years
and its frequent buzzing of NATO military assets in the region, it makes
sense to enhance deterrence of a Russian military threat to all NATO
member states. The dramatic downsizing of U.S. capabilities in Europe
over the last quarter century, to the point where the United States now
has only 30,000 army troops and no heavy brigades on the entire
continent, was never intended to signal a lack of U.S. resolve in
maintaining its ironclad support for the transatlantic alliance, and so
there is no reason not to reverse some of those withdrawals. At least
for now, it should not take much to reinforce U.S. commitments.
Stationing a major NATO force in the Baltics, for example, not only is
unnec­essary but also could provoke Putin as easily as deter him, given
his tempera­ment and his desire to restore Russia's status. Firmness and
prudence should be the watchwords, and for that, a reinforced tripwire
is more appropriate than a robust forward defense posture. Current
efforts, under the European **[Reassurance Initiative and Operation
Atlantic Resolve, to maintain a nearly continuous U.S. presence through
exercises, position four NATO battalions in the Baltic states, and
sustain modest stocks of equipment in up to seven eastern NATO countries
make sense]{.underline}**. **[It also seems sensible to return a U.S.
heavy brigade to Europe, perhaps to Germany, as is currently being
consid­ered]{.underline}**. [Greater participation by other NATO
countries in the reassurance and deterrence mission, with a sustained
military presence in the eastern states of a magnitude comparable to
that of the U.S. level, would also be useful, demonstrating that
alliance solidarity and security are truly collective
efforts]{.underline}. It is heartening that NATO decisions now codify
such initiatives. Such moves in the military and diplomatic spheres will
complement the ongoing impact of economic sanctions, which have played
an important role both in making Russia pay a price for its actions and
in demonstrating alliance cohesion. It is true that the drop in energy
prices has hurt Russia's economy even more than the Western sanctions
have, but the two pressures reinforce each other and have driven Russia
into a recession for two straight years. Putin remains popular, having
wrapped himself in the cloak of nationalism while sup­pressing domestic
dissent, but he must worry that his popularity will not endure forever
in the face of a protracted eco­nomic downturn. In fact, the success of
sanctions in constraining Russia and in helping drive Iran to the
negotiating table indicates that comprehensive strategies for dealing
with regional threats these days should involve the Treasury Department
and the Justice Department just as much as the Defense Department and
the State Department. **[A national security strategy that main­tains
international order, checks China and Russia, and prepares properly for
handling future threats and possible contingencies needs to be supported
by a defense budget of appropriate size and composition]{.underline}**.
**[That means not only holding off on any further cuts but also adopting
a thoughtful, measured increase]{.underline}**. It [is also time to end
the perennial threats of sequestration and shutdown and place the
Pentagon's budget on a gentle upward path in real terms]{.underline}.
Those who worry about an American military supposedly in decline should
relax. [The current U.S. defense budget of just over \$600 billion a
year exceeds the Cold War average of about \$525 billion (in 2016
dollars) and greatly exceeds the pre-9/11 defense budget of some \$400
billion]{.underline}. It is true that defense spending from 2011 through
2020 [has been
cut](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2013-10-15/accepting-austerity)
by a cumulative total of about \$1 trillion (not counting reductions in
war-related costs). But there were legitimate reasons for most of those
reductions, and the cuts were made to a budget at a historically very
high level. [We disagree with those who counsel further cuts, and we
strongly resist a return to sequestration-level spending (as could still
happen, since the chief villain and cause of sequestration, the 2011
Budget Control Act, remains the law of the land]{.underline}). **[There
are good reasons why the United States needs to spend as much as it does
on defense: because it has such a broad range of global
responsibilities, because asymmetric foreign capabilities (such as
Chinese precision-guided missiles and Russian advanced air defenses) can
require large investments to counter convincingly, and, most important,
because it should aim to deter conflicts rather than simply prevail in
them]{.underline}**. To be sure, many U.S. allies are wealthy enough to
contribute substantially to their own defense and should certainly do
more in that regard. But engaging in a game of chicken to try to
persuade them to live up to their commitments would be a dangerous
mistake. Having reached nearly five percent of GDP in the later Bush and
early Obama years, U.S. defense spending is now down to about three
percent. [That is not an undue burden on the U.S. economy and is in fact
a bargain given the peace, security, and international stability that it
underwrites]{.underline}. There is no need to return to significantly
higher levels, such as the four percent of GDP that some have proposed.
But nor would it be prudent to drop below three percent. That translates
into perhaps \$625 billion to \$650 billion a year in constant dollars
over the next few years for the overall national defense budget,
including war costs (assuming they remain at roughly current
amounts**[). That level is sensible and affordable, and what the next
president should work with Congress to provide. With that sort of
support, there is every reason to believe that the country's fortunate
military position can be sustained for many years to
come.]{.underline}**

#### Any reduction in militarism leaves the US as a paper tiger

Reihan **Salam**, 1/4/**19**, the Atlantic, Democrats Are Wrong About
Defense Spending, Reihan Salam is a Harvard Graduate and the president
of the Manhattan institute,

The Democrats seeking their party's 2020 presidential nomination will
surely disagree about a great many things, such as the wisdom of
Medicare for all, whether to embrace a Green New Deal, and how far to go
when raising taxes. One emerging consensus, though, is that, as Senator
Elizabeth Warren recently argued in the latest edition of Foreign
Affairs, "the Pentagon's budget has been too large for too long."
Together with a number of rival presidential aspirants, including
Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Jeff Merkley, and Bernie
Sanders, she voted against the 2019 defense budget, which authorized an
impressive-sounding \$716 billion in spending. It is a safe bet we will
hear further calls for curbing the Pentagon's putatively bloated budget
from Warren and others in the weeks and months to come. But it would be
a mistake to heed them. First, it must be said that the U.S. defense
establishment is badly in need of reform, and there is no question that
defense planners have been guilty of egregiously wasting taxpayer
dollars. There is a great deal of wisdom in Warren's critique of the
Pentagon, such as when she warns against "mindlessly buying more of
yesterday's equipment and allowing foreign countries to dominate the
development of critical new technologies" and calls instead for
"investing in cutting-edge science and technology capabilities at home."
I couldn't agree more. When Warren insists that "it's time to seriously
review the country's military commitments overseas," including in
Afghanistan and Iraq, she clearly speaks for a large number of Americans
who see little point in prolonging the U.S. military presence in either
country, Defense Secretary James Mattis's objections notwithstanding.
And she is right to lament the militarization of U.S. foreign policy,
which stems at least in part from underinvestment in the State
Department and federal agencies devoted to fostering growth and
stability in regions that might otherwise give rise to costly conflicts.
All of this can be true---and yet, we'd still be foolish to pursue deep
cuts in military expenditures. Even if the U.S. were to adopt a more
restrained military posture, as we should, especially regarding more
peripheral interests[, meeting the demands of great-power competition is
almost certain to grow more expensive rather than less in the near
future.]{.underline} [The diffusion of advanced military technologies,
and particularly of so-called anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) battle
networks, means that U.S. military forces no longer enjoy unchallenged
superiority in every theater.]{.underline} The increasing lethality of
the Chinese and Russian militaries is not license for military spending
to grow without limit. U.S. fiscal and human resources are limited, and
the Pentagon won't and shouldn't be spared the making of hard choices.
But if we intend to preserve our network of alliances and security
guarantees in Europe and the western Pacific---something that can't be
taken for granted in the Donald Trump era, to be sure, but that Warren,
Bernie Sanders, and other leading lights of the U.S. center-left
maintain they favor---it is going to cost us. And any savings we'd
realize from ending our presence in Syria or Afghanistan won't make much
of a dent. And why is that? Isn't it the case that U.S. military
spending dwarfs that of China and Russia? Sanders often observes that,
as he stated in an October address outlining his foreign-policy vision,
the U.S. spends more on its military "than the next 10 nations
combined," China and Russia included. One can quibble with Sanders's
calculation, but his larger point is well taken. It is true that the
U.S. spends more than its potential rivals. It is also true, however,
that the U.S. sets out to do much more than its potential rivals.
Foreign militaries that focus exclusively on using force in a single
theater are able to concentrate their resources, which might allow them
to achieve local superiority over a U.S. military that, while far more
capable in aggregate, must divide its attention across a number of
theaters. This wouldn't be a problem if, say, the U.S. swore off
exercising military force anywhere outside the Western Hemisphere, but
this would represent a revolutionary shift in U.S. foreign and defense
policy that is roundly rejected by the Democratic mainstream. So long as
the U.S. is committed to projecting military power at great distance
from its own territory, its expeditionary forces will be at a
disadvantage vis-a-vis rival powers operating closer to their home turf.
Durable alliances are essential to addressing this disadvantage. If our
goal is to prevent China or Russia from dominating their neighbors, it
helps to have U.S. troops forward-based in potential flash points so
they're capable of blunting an enemy's advance, giving war-winning
forces time to gather over the horizon. Since the end of the Cold War,
many Americans have come to see the presence [of U.S. forces in allied
countries as a gesture of solidarity, which can itself deter foes and
reassure friends. But forward-deployed forces are only reassuring if
they have meaningful war-fighting capability,]{.underline} and as
Elbridge Colby and Jonathan F. Solomon argue in their fittingly titled
essay "Avoiding Becoming a Paper Tiger," [the U.S. and its allies have
allowed the survivability and war-fighting capability of their
forward-deployed forces to deteriorate. That, in turn, has made it more
likely that rival powers might try their luck by launching limited
attacks designed to shred the credibility of U.S. security guarantees,
attacks that could prove enormously destabilizing. Dissuading
mischief-making along these lines will---you guessed it---require
increased investment.]{.underline} There is another reason U.S. military
spending is so high, one that will be exceptionally difficult for
Democrats in particular to confront. According to the political
scientist Lindsay Cohn, the U.S. military finds itself in a benefits
trap. One of the chief ways the U.S. military attracts and retains
high-quality personnel is by offering benefits that are more generous
than those available elsewhere in the labor market. This recruitment
strategy doesn't work nearly as well in market democracies with more
expansive welfare states, where the lure of health care, child care,
education, and retirement benefits just isn't the same. It is no
coincidence that most European NATO allies stuck with conscription long
after it was phased out in the U.S., and a dire shortage of military
staffing has prompted Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's heir apparent, to muse about bringing it back. But in
the U.S., where the idea of conscription has been anathema for decades,
a relatively generous suite of in-kind benefits has been an essential
part of the civil-military contract, and it has contributed to dramatic
increases in personnel costs in recent years, which are set to
accelerate further. Cut all the waste, fraud, and abuse you'd like (I'm
with you), and you'll still have to deal with rising health expenditures
for U.S. service members and their dependents. Crack down on
unscrupulous defense contractors (seriously, please do), and military
pension benefits will still grow more difficult to sustain. To contain
the Pentagon's budget without drastically retrenching the U.S. role in
the world would mean, at a minimum, sharply reducing future military
benefits. Leaving aside the practical implications of doing so for
maintaining an all-volunteer force, such a proposal would strike most
Americans, who rightly celebrate military service as selfless, as
offensive on its face. Dovish left-wingers have tended to be more
vulnerable to charges of being insufficiently concerned about the
welfare of service members and veterans than hawkish right-wingers, as
galling as that must seem to those in the former camp, who see
themselves as keeping military personnel out of harm's way. Insofar as
debates over the Pentagon's budget become debates about military pay and
benefits, expect them to become more treacherous for the revitalized
left, not less. And that is why I suspect that in the event a Democratic
president is inaugurated come 2021, a possibility that would be foolish
to discount, U.S. military spending will continue its upward drift on
her or his watch, and the world will be better for it. I look forward to
the commissioning of the U.S.S. Eugene V. Debs.

#### We must continue to upgrade our nuclear defense strategies in order to maintain deterrence

Adm. Dennis C. **Blair** (Ret.), 2-7-**2019**, \"Why the US must
accelerate all elements of space-based nuclear deterrence,\" Defense
News,
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/02/07/why-the-us-must-accelerate-all-elements-of-space-based-nuclear-deterrence/

In recent years, [robust dialogue and billions of dollars have been
devoted to [modernizing the nuclear
triad](https://www.defensenews.com/space/2019/01/28/the-next-six-months-could-define-americas-missile-defense-for-a-generation/),
the three weapons systems that provide second-strike capability to deter
adversaries from a nuclear attack on the United States.]{.underline}
Yet, **[deterrence depends not only on a modernized triad but also on
survivable systems for decision-makers to understand the nature of a
nuclear attack, and to command and control the response]{.underline}**.
Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats testified a few days ago:
["Russia and China will continue to pursue a full range of
anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce U.S. military effectiveness
and overall security."]{.underline} Without reliable and secure
surveillance and communications systems, our leaders may find themselves
well-armed, but blind and dumb**[. A weakness in our nation's sensing
and communications systems undermines the entire
deterrent.]{.underline}** [The United States' strategic "thin line" is
the communications network, much of it spaceborne, that connects our
nuclear weapons, sensors and related systems to the president and his
national security team.]{.underline} It must be [modernized and
enhanced](https://www.defensenews.com/newsletters/tv-next-episode/2019/01/28/whats-inand-not-in-the-long-awaited-missile-defense-review/)
soon to maintain a credible deterrent against Russia and China**[. As
the rivalry between the United States and these countries increases,
with the one resentful of the loss of past superpower prestige, and the
other committed to acquiring it, our nation needs a nuclear deterrent of
which all its components are strong and resilient]{.underline}**. [China
recently test fired another of its long-range, nuclear-capable missiles,
the DF-26]{.underline}. When the Cold War ended almost 40 years ago, the
United States cut its strategic arsenal dramatically. In addition, it
eliminated much of the redundancy and resiliency in the supporting
components of the nation's nuclear capability. Over time, this policy
has left the United States with a fragile nuclear deterrent space
architecture. One example is the policy of procuring replacement
satellites just in time to meet projected spacecraft failure dates,
leaving our satellite constellations vulnerable to a single launch
failure or hostile action. [It is encouraging that the Department of
Defense decided last fall to significantly accelerate the satellite
system that detects the launch of ballistic missiles, called the
Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared program]{.underline}. The
Next-Gen OPIR Block 0 satellite system will be far more survivable than
its predecessor, the current Space-Based Infrared System[. It will be
able to survive and provide essential information to American
decision-makers in crisis and conflict both against Chinese and Russian
anti-satellite measures, and when regional powers are threatening the
use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. However, **[equally important to
nuclear deterrence is a survivable communications system for national
leaders to receive the sensor information, to consult with each other
and to issue orders to our own nuclear systems.]{.underline}** The
Defense Department has not yet focused on the need to accelerate the
other key element --- the Evolved Strategic SATCOM system. ESS, the
replacement for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency system used to
protect military satellite communications systems currently in orbit, is
not scheduled to be fielded until at least 2030. [Replacing all three
legs of the triad and accelerating the missile-launch warning element of
the nation's nuclear deterrent, but not upgrading the equally important
protected-communications element leaves a gaping
vulnerability]{.underline}. There has been recent discussion of
eliminating the nuclear-hardening requirement for the U.S.' strategic
space surveillance and communications elements to increase competition
and lower cost. Arguments have been made that as China and Russia
develop non-nuclear, counter-space weapons, they are not likely to use
nuclear detonations in space to blind and deafen American systems. **[In
fact, the Russians, Chinese and other nuclear states such as North Korea
will choose not to use the full range of anti-satellite capabilities,
from lasers and proximity operations through nuclear detonations in
space, only if American systems are resistant to them.]{.underline}**
Moreover, thanks to increased government space resilience investment
over the past few years, industry is more than capable of fielding
resilient strategic space communications at a reasonable cost. The
marginal cost of hardening a spacecraft against nuclear effects is only
about 1 percent of its system cost. [Continuing to nuclear harden the
U.S.\' strategic thin-line space assets is both a sound and inexpensive
insurance policy.]{.underline} The Next-Gen OPIR and ESS programs must
be capable, affordable, resilient and fielded in time to address the
dynamic and dangerous security environment on Earth and in outer space.
**[Deterrence of nuclear attack --- ensuring the very survival of the
nation --- depends on the capability to provide national decision-makers
early warning and continuous knowledge of missile attacks, and for
national leaders and operational commanders to command, control and
communicate under contested war-fighting conditions]{.underline}**. U.S.
industry is ready to provide resilient systems capable across all levels
of conflict and against all challengers. This approach must be applied
to all strategic mission areas, or the U.S. will be susceptible to a
crippling attack against the weakest link; the very existence of that
weakness undermines deterrence. It is not a risk worth running --- all
that is needed is a U.S. government decision to field resilient
strategic systems sooner rather than later.

#### A strong nuclear deterrence is key to prevent escalation in East Asia 

Eric **Heginbotham** **et al, 2017,** ERIC HEGINBOTHAM is a principal
research scientist at MIT\'s Security Studies Program and a specialist
in Asian security issues, "China's evolving nuclear deterrent" pages
159-163, RAND, <https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1628.html>

[China's nuclear modernization and the expansion and diversification of
its forces pose growing challenges to the credibility of U.S. extended
deterrence]{.underline}. **[If enough Chinese nuclear forces could
survive a U.S. retaliatory strike to conduct a powerful retaliatory
strike of their own against U.S. targets, Japanese leaders might ask
whether Chinese leaders would take a U.S. threat to strike on Japan's
behalf seriously]{.underline}**: Would Washington really risk losing
Seattle and/or Los Angeles to retaliate after an attack on Tokyo? [An
extension of this logic may raise questions in Tokyo and other allied
capitals about how changes in the nuclear balance will affect
conventional deterrence and the credibility of U.S. alliance commitments
more generally]{.underline}. The United States has distanced itself from
the threat of nuclear use in the context of conventional attack in
recent years, most notably in the 2010 NPR. Nevertheless[, any prudent
Chinese leader would certainly consider the risks of U.S. escalation to
the nuclear level. The deterrent value of these doubts may, however,
decline significantly in the context of a more secure and robust Chinese
second-strike capability]{.underline}. Chinese leaders might thus accept
a higher degree of risk in political and "gray zone" crises with a more
robust nuclear force than without. This logic lies at the heart of the
so-called stability-instability paradox, within which a more stable
nuclear structure may lead to increased instability at lower levels.8
With Chinese conventional capabilities improving rapidly and with their
ability to threaten significant losses against U.S. forces in a more
limited conflict increasing, the shift in nuclear calculations might
also become more salient.9 [The United States would probably only
consider escalating to the nuclear level if it were losing a
conventional conflict or had sustained severe losses (and probably not
even then), and the probability of such scenarios, while low today, is
growing over time]{.underline}. Hence, nuclear escalation in the context
of conventional warfare (i.e., intrawar deterrence or escalation
control) may assume greater importance for Chinese leaders as the PLA's
conventional capabilities improve. [Questions about how Chinese
conventional and nuclear modernization affect both nuclear and
conventional deterrence have already become more prominent in South
Korea and, especially, Japan]{.underline}. In response to regional
concerns, the United States began separate dialogues on strategic issues
with both Tokyo and Seoul in 2009. Although elite opinion in Japan is
divided, some have suggested a more "NATO-like". While it is unclear
exactly what that would look like in East Asia, two features of extended
deterrence in the NATO context are prominent: first, the independent
possession of nuclear weapons by Britain and France (in addition to the
United States) and, second, the participation of a subgroup of NATO
allies in NATO's nuclear sharing arrangements. Should allied concerns
continue to grow in Asia, it is likely that five possible responses
will, to one extent or another, be discussed. [First, there may be
appeals for the United States to adjust or clarify its declaratory
policy, possibly to include implicit but nevertheless clear nuclear
deterrence of conventional attack]{.underline}. Second, there may be
calls for the United States to maintain an array of deployable tactical
nuclear weapons to signal a credible response in the event of limited
Chinese use of nuclear weapons. Third, some regional voices will call
for the redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to East Asia or onboard
naval U.S. surface ships or attack submarines, a position that, under
current circumstances, large segments of the populations of allied
countries would oppose. Fourth, there will be increased momentum to
develop long-range conventional strike capabilities designed to provide
at least some punishment capability in the event of Chinese conventional
attack. And fifth, [should regional actors come to fundamentally
question the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence, South Korean or
Japanese support for nuclear armament is likely to grow more
widespread]{.underline}.11 Each of these measures would have significant
consequences, including some upside potential for deterrence and
alliance solidarity and negative consequences for the U.S. relationship
with China and for U.S. global disarmament and nonproliferation efforts.
In addition, any unilateral moves by South Korea or Japan would likely
affect the thinking and military behavior of the other, given the mutual
suspicions between America's two Northeast Asian allies. While the
United States will need to balance potential positive and negative
consequences to changes in its approach to China and the region, its
leaders should understand that the status quo with regard to U.S.
nuclear policy and forces will also have consequences. Both the
conventional and nuclear balances of power are evolving, and allies may
begin to pursue independent options more seriously should the United
States appear unresponsive to their concerns. The consequences of some
of the possibilities mentioned here would be far more momentous than
others, and U.S. leaders should look to shape developments proactively.
First, note that simply telling national leaders that they should
abandon certain technologies, programs, or strategies because they are
destabilizing will have little or no effect. That is especially true of
programs that are well advanced. [China will not stop modernizing and
expanding its nuclear counterstrike capabilities. Beijing will, rather,
continue pursuing the programs in keeping with available resources and
perceived threats (as interpreted and filtered through the prism of
political and bureaucratic lenses**). U.S. leaders will not cancel such
programs as BMD and CPGS. These systems support a wide range of mission
requirements that are separate from the U.S.- Chinese strategic
relationship**]{.underline}. U.S. leaders may, however, continue to
limit or restrict these programs. North Korean leaders are unlikely to
embrace nuclear disarmament, unless squeezed far more severely by
sanctions. Similarly, the United States and the Republic of Korea will
not accede to North Korean demands to cease combined military exercises
because they serve to ensure effective coordination of allied forces.
Yet, despite these structural rigidities, there are several actions that
U.S. and Chinese leaders can take to reduce the dangers of crisis
instability. The United States maintains a highly potent offensive force
posture in Asia but one that is relatively brittle and highly exposed to
potential adversary attack. To the extent that the United States can
reposture its forces to reduce their exposure to enemy attack and
increase operational resilient, it can reduce the potential benefits of
a first strike against it and improve crisis stability. [The ability to
disperse aircraft is already improving with new options in the
Philippines, Japan, and Australia. New operational concepts are being
explored, and some hardening of military facilities in Guam has also
occurred.]{.underline} This is a promising start but should be further
developed. Similarly, [the U.S. Navy's emphasis on "distributed
lethality" helps reduce Chinese incentives to target any given formation
(potentially with nuclear weapons). These types of adjustments could be
made as part of an active denial strategy, which might be considered as
an alternative to more offensive options.]{.underline}12 On the Chinese
side, the new PLA Rocket Force should work toward visibly separating its
conventional and nuclear missile force elements. Although PLA leaders
might worry that providing this observable separation would make it more
likely that an enemy would conduct conventional attacks on the Chinese
homeland, that risk is mitigated by the high levels of survivability
that conventional and nuclear mobile missile launchers enjoy. Separating
these forces would reduce the more serious risk of rapid escalation
toward the nuclear threshold, should a conflict occur. **[As Chinese
nuclear forces become more robust and survivable, U.S. leaders must take
positive steps to fortify the credibility of extended deterrence
commitments to regional friends and allies, particularly
Japan]{.underline}**. Combined exercises treating nuclear deterrence and
escalation topics should be conducted to supplement nuclear dialogues
within the alliance and increase the level of mutual understanding of
each ally's thinking and concerns. **[The modernization of the U.S.
tactical nuclear arsenal will likely increase regional confidence in the
U.S. commitment to extended deterrence and mitigate, to an extent,
concerns about extended deterrence]{.underline}**. While U.S. leaders
will want to be cautious about any changes to U.S. declaratory policy
that might increase the emphasis on nuclear deterrence, they may find
some adjustment preferable to independent actions by Japan and/or South
Korea.13 At the same time, the United States should engage Japan
proactively on Tokyo's development of conventional long-range strike
capabilities to ensure that, if Japan pursues strike capabilities, it
develops systems that are secure from attack and, therefore, do not
encourage preemption in crisis. One area where the United States should
exercise caution is in the future development of BMD systems. The sizing
of U.S. NMD should be strictly limited to the threat North Korea poses.
The United States has expanded its inventory of ground-based
interceptors to 44, despite the fact that North Korea has yet to deploy
a single ICBM capable of reaching the United States. In the minds of
Chinese leaders, this commitment of resources to NMD raises questions
about the true intent of U.S. missile defense efforts. Missile defense
is the largest single external factor driving the expansion of China's
ICBM and SSBN force. Washington should continue to emphasize to Chinese
leaders the importance to all parties of limiting North Korean missile
and nuclear advances and commit to no further expansion of NMD should
the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs be frozen---and possibly to
reducing the number of interceptors should North Korean programs be
dismantled. At the same time, it is incumbent on Beijing to acknowledge
this message. Since a key strategic concern for China is U.S. missile
defense capabilities, it is imperative that Beijing recognize that the
key regional driver for these is the development of North Korean nuclear
programs. Both further nuclear testing and the development of ICBM
capabilities by Pyongyang will intensify U.S. missile defense efforts,
which in turn will deepen the spiral driving Chinese modernization.
Beijing should employ all available leverage, including its ability to
restrict oil supplies, to discourage Pyongyang from making further
nuclear and missile advances. China should also specify the calculus it
uses to size its forces and should prioritize means other than
increasing numbers to buttress survivability. Without such a calculus,
there is no logical upper limit to the "lean" force to which China is
pledged. Hence, such metrics will not only help U.S. and other states
understand China's nuclear logic but will also help Chinese leaders
avoid the danger that bureaucratic forces and incrementalism will hijack
nuclear force development. As for specific measures to 13 See Mark
Fitzpatrick, Asia's Latent Nuclear Powers: Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan, Washington, D.C.: International Institute for Strategic Studies,
2016. China's Accelerating Nuclear Modernization: Implications 163
increase survivability, China will almost certainly adopt a portfolio
approach, but it should emphasize, for example, higher alert levels
(while maintaining tight control over warheads), improved penetration
aids, and possibly even point defenses, rather than deploying larger
numbers of offensive systems. To the extent that numbers are increased,
China should deploy survivable single-warhead delivery systems, rather
than MIRVs. To be sure, MIRVing may provide the most efficient use of
scarce funds, measured in terms of warheads produced per yuan. But the
gains to second-strike survivability would not be proportionate to the
number of warheads built because missiles with MIRVs would represent
concentrated targets. And the political costs in terms of aggravated
regional and U.S. suspicion would be very high. While the policy
measures described here should be encouraged, our research suggests that
many of the drivers we have discussed in this report will persist and
that the two sides will likely find themselves in a deepening nuclear
arms competition. In this context, the importance of avoiding
conventional conflict takes on a greater priority

[As the new Congress prepares to convene in January, it will face few
tasks, if any, more important than adequately funding our nation's
defense]{.underline}. **[While our armed forces' most fundamental
mission lies in defending our nation and deterring our adversaries, a
strong defense budget brings many other strategic
benefits]{.underline}**. Five years ago, when testifying before the
Senate Armed Services Committee, then-CENTCOM Commander Gen. [James
Mattis](https://thehill.com/people/james-mattis) [made a memorable
plea](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4658822/mattis-ammunition) for the
State Department's budget: "[If you don't fund the State Department
fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately]{.underline}." In
this oft-quoted statement, Mattis offered an arresting argument for the
importance of the State Department and diplomacy in preventing armed
conflict and security threats to the United States. Yet the opposite
also is true: to strengthen the State Department, along with U.S.
diplomatic and economic influence, we need a large [defense
budget](https://dod.defense.gov/News/SpecialReports/Budget2019.aspx). A
common misconception in many policy debates is that military force and
diplomacy stand in opposition, at polar ends of the statecraft
spectrum[. A powerful military can strengthen diplomacy and make
peaceful settlements more likely, precisely because the possibility of
force looms in the diplomatic background]{.underline}. The historical
record bears witness to this. American military power has played an
indispensable role in the creation and sustenance of the international
political and economic order for three-quarters of a century. For most
of this time, our military strength helped accomplish much of this
without firing a hostile shot. Specifically, [a strong military:

the peace societies of every kind and sort."]{.underline}** Induces

defense. [A robust American military budget can induce our allies to
deepen their own commitments]{.underline}. For example, upon taking
office in 1981 and launching his massive defense build-up, [President

spending. These efforts succeeded with our NATO allies and, most
especially, with Japan, which followed the U.S. example by dramatically
upping its defense budget]{.underline}. Strengthens our economic

administration, led by Treasury Secretary James Baker, successfully
negotiated favorable changes in international monetary policy with Japan
and America's other G-7 allies that devalued the dollar and relieved
U.S. trade deficits. The strong U.S. military and defense commitments to
these allies contributed to their willingness to make otherwise
difficult concessions on currency policy. Strengthens our negotiating
posture with adversaries. [Perhaps the most notable arms control
agreement of the past half-century is the Intermediate Range Nuclear
Forces ([INF](https://www.state.gov/t/avc/trty/102360.htm)) Treaty

#### The U.S. uses its deterrence 

**Lopez 19** (C. Todd Lopez Author from the U.S. Department of Defense.
"4 Things to Know About the U.S. Nuclear Deterrence Strategy". U.S.
Department of Defense. April 1, 2019.

U.S. military leaders went before lawmakers to emphasize a handful of
critical, but immensely important points about America's nuclear weapons
capabilities. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan and Marine
Corps Gen. Joe Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
testified at a House Armed Services Committee hearing. David
Trachtenberg, deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, spoke before
the HASC strategic forces subcommittee. The fiscal year 2020 budget
request from President Donald J. Trump was the impetus for both
hearings, but America's nuclear defense strategy was clearly important
to lawmakers on both days. Important takeaways from this glowing-hot
topic? [Nuclear deterrence is a top priority within the U.S.
military]{.underline}. \"It\'s our singular, most important
mission,\" Dunford told lawmakers. \"[Nuclear deterrence is the bedrock
of U.S. national security,\"]{.underline} Trachtenberg said. \"[Our
nuclear deterrent underwrites all U.S. military operations and diplomacy
across the globe. It is the backstop and foundation of our national
defense. A strong nuclear deterrent also contributes to U.S.
non-proliferation goals by limiting the incentive for allies to have
their own nuclear weapons]{.underline}.\" Nuclear deterrence means that
when the U.S. has nuclear weapons, it tempers in some fashion the
activities of potential adversaries around the globe --- [helping to
ensure those adversaries don't make dangerous miscalculations about what
they can get away with based on what they think the U.S. is capable of
or willing to do in response.]{.underline} Recapitalization, often
referred to as modernization, of America's strategic nuclear capability
is critical, defense officials have said. Recapitalization means that
existing weapons will be replaced with completely new weapons or will be
overhauled from the ground up and equipped with the latest technology.
Recapitalization of the nuclear force during the next 20 years will
comprise, at its highest point, about 3.7% of the DOD budget, a defense
official said. This year's request to recapitalize the nuclear
enterprise comprises about 1.2% of the total DOD budget request, the
official noted. [America's strategic capability includes nuclear weapons
such as those in missile silos, on submarines, and on bomber aircraft.
The U.S. refers to those weapons, in those three locations, as \"the
nuclear triad.]{.underline}\" Weapons within the triad include
ground-based Minuteman III weapons, submarine-launched Trident II
missiles, and an array of nuclear bombs designed to be delivered by
aircraft such as the B-2 Spirit or the B-52 Stratofortress. These
weapons systems are getting old and must be modernized to ensure they
continue to operate and that they retain their deterrent capability,
defense officials have said. \"Nuclear forces are the ultimate
foundation of our nation's security,\" Trachtenberg said. \"[Our
deterrent forces must be modernized to remain credible. Delay is not an
option.\" Defense officials have said China and Russia are prioritizing
high levels of defense spending to modernize their nuclear forces and
the U.S. must invest in its systems to maintain]{.underline}
[parity]{.underline}. A Pentagon official noted that the Russian defense
minister has said that 90% of the country's strategic nuclear forces
will be armed with modern weaponry by 2020. The U.S. military further
seeks to strengthen deterrence by addressing an imbalance in its
nonstrategic, or low-yield, nuclear weapons without matching Russia
system for system, a defense official said. The official added that
these supplemental capabilities will help ensure Russia, China and
others do not believe they can benefit from using low-yield nuclear
weapons on the battlefield against the U.S. or its allies and partners.
The defense official said these capabilities do not require nuclear
testing, do not violate arms control treaties, and in the end will
reduce the likelihood that Russia will use its large number of
non-strategic nuclear weapons, thereby strengthening deterrence and
helping prevent conflict in the first place. The U.S. recently suspended
its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and
gave notice of its intent to withdraw after long-term violations of the
treaty by Russia, a defense official said, adding that U.S. allies fully
support the decision. \"Russia is in material breach of the INF Treaty
and must use the next six months to return to full and verifiable
compliance or bear sole responsibility for its demise,\" NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter, Feb. 1. The United States is
now examining options for its conventional ground-based intermediate
strike missiles, a defense official said. The official noted that the
initial developmental work is designed to be reversible should Russia
resume complying with the INF Treaty before the six-month period
expires.

[The American military is reentering a period of
competition]{.underline}. For the 20 years following the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the U.S. military reigned supreme, nearly unchallengeable
in any state-on-state contingency that Washington might seriously care
to take on. This meant that a whole generation of [U.S. policymakers and
military professionals became accustomed to U.S. military
dominance]{.underline}, a dominance that enabled, and in some cases even
propelled, a more ambitious and assertive foreign policy. Yet as the
Pentagon has been making increasingly clear in recent years, this
long-accepted ascendancy is now in question. [The conventional military
buildup of China's People's Liberation Army]{.underline} (PLA),
[Russia's sophisticated modernization of its nuclear and nonnuclear
forces, the proliferation of nuclear arms to North Korea, and the
general diffusion of advanced technologies associated with the
Revolution in Military Affairs all mean that U.S. military primacy is
under increasingly severe stress.]{.underline} [The Pentagon has already
begun to take steps to try to respond to these troubling
developments]{.underline}, including through its commendable new Third
Offset Strategy and related initiatives. These are designed to leverage
U.S. advantages in the development and exploitation of technology, in
bureaucratic flexibility, and in military doctrine and training to
extend U.S. conventional military superiority into the future. Hopefully
this endeavor will pay off. But the reality is that even if they are
successful, these efforts will not spare the U.S. military the need to
alter the way it is postured, operates, and plans for conflict. Indeed,
the Offset Strategy's very success likely depends upon such changes. And
some of these modifications are likely to be significant---not only in
strictly military terms but also in the political and strategic
consequences they entail[. The Importance of "Presence" One of the most
fundamental of these changes will be the way the U.S. military postures
itself and operates, particularly in peacetime]{.underline}. Since the
end of World War II, the United States has pursued a national strategy
of forward engagement, allying or partnering with a host of countries in
Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, and, as it viewed necessary, fighting
adversaries in these key regions. As a corollary of this strategy, U.S.
military forces have been forward-based in or otherwise rotationally
deployed to these areas. The presence of U.S. forces has thus been a
regular feature of the strategic landscape of these regions, playing a
significant role in shaping perceptions and calculations among allies
and foes of Washington. Indeed, this presence has become such a regular
feature of political-military life in these areas that many consider it
a significant factor in the deterrence of adversaries and there
assurance of allies. In fact, to some, the visible, tangible presence of
U.S. forces has been as much---if not more---of a factor in deterrence
and assurance as the actual warfighting ability of those forces. To this
way of thinking, one that has become particularly ascendant since the
end of the Cold War, the fact that U.S. forces were present to
demonstrate American will and resolve was more important than their
combat capabilities. Such a view represents a distinct change from how
U.S. strategy conceived of the purpose of forward presence prior to the
collapse of the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, U.S. forces abroad
evidenced American resolve, but they were also expected to perform
important specific military objectives in the event of war. U.S.
conventional military posture, force design, and operations, especially
after the Soviet Union attained the ability to launch nuclear strikes at
the American homeland, were typically determined---or at least heavily
influenced---by the particular military concerns of how to stave off
and, ideally, defeat Soviet Bloc aggression or coercion and, if this
failed, to make the threat of U.S. nuclear usage more credible. The U.S.
military of the latter part of the Cold War consequently developed
conventional forces, based and operated them, and planned for their
employment primarily with these warfighting concerns in mind. In the
wake of the dissolution of the Soviet threat, however, this demanding
requirement evaporated. U.S. forces no longer faced a peer or near-peer
challenger that could seriously contest them in plausible contingencies.
Yet at the same time, Washington---sensibly---elected to maintain its
national strategy of forward strategic engagement and the military
primacy that underwrote it. Even as the United States reduced its force
structure from its 1980s peak, though, it retained many of the
forward-presence requirements (albeit with some reductions and
tailoring) that it had established during the Cold War. U.S. forces
still actively patrolled the waters of the Western Pacific and the skies
over the Middle East and were stationed in Germany, Japan, and South
Korea. This led to a situation in which, as the memory of the Soviet
threat faded, the presence of U.S. forces seemed to become as much the
point of their existence as their warfighting capabilities. The value of
presence independent of warfighting capability had some strategic logic;
visible forces continued to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to stay
engaged, both to friend and foe. But they also allowed the military
Services and sympathetic defense decisionmakers and strategists to argue
for sustained, if not larger, budgets. Allies abroad, meanwhile, rarely
objected to U.S. forces deployed nearby. As long as U.S. forces were
sized above certain thresholds and challenges to the supremacy of the
U.S. military remained relatively modest, Washington faced no serious
tradeoffs between combat readiness and day-to-day "showing of the flag."
As a consequence of all these factors, the importance of presence as a
goal in and of itself was trumpeted in documents such as Quadrennial
Defense Reviews and Service strategic documents.1Yet this is no longer
the world the U.S. military faces. Rather, the United States is
confronted with intensifying challenges to its military primacy,
especially from China and Russia. At the same time, the United States
has been chipping away at its own military preeminence through
sequestration and a straitjacket approach to budget efficiency that
prevents the Defense Department from downsizing in a strategic fashion.
In this world, presence is no longer a relatively costless good;
peacetime forward presence in this more challenging, emerging
military-technological environment will involve tradeoffs, including
some drastic ones, with war-waging ability. U.S. forces that operate
forward within the expanding and darkening threat envelopes generated by
the increasing military power of potential U.S. opponents will be
placing themselves at greater and greater risk. For instance, U.S.
warships such as aircraft carriers that are lauded for showing the
flagin the Western Pacific are increasingly vulnerable to potential
Chinese attack capabilities, such as the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic
missile and the PLA's large arsenal of anti-ship cruisemissiles.2At the
same time, impressive new U.S. shorter range aircraft such as the F-35
need to operate from airfields, such as on Okinawa, well within the
reach of Chinese precision-guided land-attack munitions. The bases that
house U.S. ground forces on Okinawa and elsewhere in the Western Pacific
that show the U.S. commitment to staying put in the region, meanwhile,
are also increasingly vulnerable---as are the aircraft and ships
designed to supply and move these forces around. The essential point is
that the U.S. forces that are postured and employed primarily for
visible frontline presence as an independent missionare increasingly
sacrificing their combat survivability, with corresponding degradation
of their war-waging utility. Presence and Warfighting Ability This is a
problem, in fact a very serious one, because, despite some of the
rhetoric of the post--Cold War era[, deterrence derives not from the
symbolism of being present but above all from a potential attacker's
perceptions of the defender's realistically employable military power
and capability---in other words, from warfighting ability]{.underline}.
Presence can contribute to this calculus by reinforcing the perception
of the defender's will or by latently complicatingan aggressor's path
toward conquest, but it does not itself constitute effective deterrence.
Rather, at its root, deterrence stems from the perceived ability to harm
an opponent or todefeat or blunt his actions to such a degree that he
will act with restraint or back down. [In the realm of nuclear weapons,
the ability to harm tends to predominate as a driver of
decision.]{.underline} In calculations of conventional conflict,
however, deterrence by denial tends to be more salient than deterrence
by cost-imposition (though the latter can play a significantrole). That
is, conventional deterrence relies primarily on a potential aggressor's
judgment of one's ability to prevent him from forcibly attaining his
political objectives, if not defeat him outright. Thus the conventional
forces that deter most effectively are those that can contribute to the
frustration or decisive defeat of the adversary's pursuit of his aims.
[3Because of the different mechanism of effect, what defines effective
conventional deterrence is different from what typifies its nuclear
variant. In nuclear deterrence, after a certain threshold, resolve tends
to be central]{.underline}. In conventional dynamics, however, the
ability to bog down and frustrate if not prevail over an opponent's
military forces is usually central because the ability to harm is so
circumscribed, especially against near-peer adversaries.Thus what is
particularly important for conventional deterrence is maintaining an
advantage in conventional military power, particularly with respect to a
given potentially contestedarea.4 In particular, scholarship indicates
that conventional deterrence has been most effective when adversaries
judged that a potential defender's conventional forces could resist
their attacks, particularly in a relatively short timeframe. To put it
another way, the combined effects of the defender's in-theater and
otherwise quickly surgeable forces' capabilities, quantities, postures,
and positioning had outsized effects upon the decisions made by the
potential aggressor state leaders. When defenders induced those leaders
to believe that any notional conventional offensive would likely be
arrested and that, at minimum, would result in a protracted conflict
fraught with high cost, risk, and uncertainty, successful deterrence was
almost always the historical result.5This not only shows the value of
forward-deployed and decisive surge forces, but it also demonstrates
that the former must, at least in aggregate, be both militarily
effective and practically usable, especially within a campaign context.
In an increasingly competitive military-technological environment,
therefore, the United States can no longer afford to deploy substantial
forces in ways that would not contribute to---or could even detract
from---prevailing in the event of conflict. Rather, the U.S. defense
posture writ large, including its forward-deployed forces, must make
clear to more capable and ambitious potential adversaries that U.S.
forces can effectively resist and respond to any aggression. Yet at the
same time, the United States has an interest in maintaining the benefits
afforded by presence. Figuring out how to maximize forward-deployed
forces' warfighting capabilities and survivability, while also enabling
at least some portion of the force to perform traditional "show the
flag" missions, therefore represents one of the era's most significant
and pressing strategic planning challenges. This is beginning, albeit
haltingly and partially, to receive the recognition it merits at the
highest levels of defense policy. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert
Work, in unjustifiably little-noticed speeches in 2014and 2015,
described in clear and unmistakable terms the increasingly high costs
presence demands that stress the U.S. military's supply of deployable
forces; these costs can and will exact from combat effectiveness---and
thus deterrence.

#### Military strength is key to uphold the stability of the liberal world order

[These days "soft" power and "smart" power are in vogue]{.underline}
(who wants to make the case for "dumb" power?) while American "hard"
power is on the chopping block. This is, in part, a symbolic sacrifice
to the fiscal crisis --- even though [the looming defense
cuts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-announces-new-military-approach/2012/01/05/gIQAFWcmcP_story.html)
are a drop in the bucket compared with the ballooning entitlement
spending that is not being cut. And partly this is the Obama
administration's election-year strategy of playing to a presumably
war-weary nation. But there is a theory behind all this: The United
States has relied too much on hard power for too long, and to be truly
effective in a complex, modern world, the United States needs to
emphasize other tools. It must be an attractive power, capable of
persuading rather than compelling. It must convene and corral both
partners and non-partners, using economic, diplomatic and other means to
"leverage" American influence. These are sensible arguments. Power takes
many forms, and it's smart to make use of all of them. But there is a
danger in taking this wisdom too far and forgetting just how important
U.S. military power has been in building and sustaining the present
liberal international order. That order has rested significantly on the
U.S. ability to provide security in parts of the world, such as Europe
and Asia, that had known endless cycles of warfare before the arrival of
the United States. The world's free-trade, free-market economy has
depended on America's ability to keep trade routes open, even during
times of conflict. And the remarkably wide spread of democracy around
the world owes something to America's ability to provide support to
democratic forces under siege and to protect peoples from dictators such
as Moammar Gaddafi and Slobodan Milosevic. Some find it absurd that the
United States should have a larger military than the next 10 nations
combined. But that gap in military power has probably been the greatest
factor in upholding an international system that, in historical terms,
is unique --- and uniquely beneficial to Americans. Nor should we forget
that this power is part of what makes America attractive to many other
nations. The world has not always loved America. During the era of
Vietnam and Watergate and the ugly last stand of segregationists,
America was often hated. But nations that relied on the United States
for security from threatening neighbors tended to overlook the country's
flaws. In the 1960s, millions of young Europeans took to the streets to
protest American "imperialism," while their governments worked to ensure
that the alliance with the United States held firm. Soft power,
meanwhile, has its limits. No U.S. president has enjoyed more
international popularity than Woodrow Wilson did when he traveled to
Paris to negotiate the treaty ending World War I. He was a hero to the
world, but he found his ability to shape the peace, and to establish the
new League of Nations, severely limited, in no small part by his
countrymen's refusal to commit U.S. military power to the defense of the
peace. John F. Kennedy, another globally admired president, found his
popularity of no use in his confrontations with Nikita Khrushchev, who,
by Kennedy's own admission, "beat the hell out of me" and who may have
been convinced by his perception of Kennedy's weakness that the United
States would tolerate his placing Soviet missiles in Cub[**a. The
international system is not static. It responds quickly to fluctuations
in power. If the United States were to cut too deeply into its ability
to project military power, other nations could be counted on to
respond** accordingly. Those nations whose power rises in relative terms
would display expanding ambitions commensurate with their new clout in
the international system. They would, as in the past, demand particular
spheres of influence**. Those whose power declined in relative terms,
like the United States, would have little choice but to cede some
influence in those areas. Thus China would lay claim to its sphere of
influence in Asia, Russia in eastern Europe and the Caucasus. And, as in
the past, these burgeoning great-power claims would overlap and
conflict: India and China claim the same sphere in the Indian Ocean;
Russia and Europe have overlapping spheres in the region between the
Black Sea and the Baltic**]{.underline}. Without the United States to
suppress and contain these conflicting ambitions, there would have to be
complex adjustments to establish a new balance. Some of these
adjustments could be made through diplomacy, as they were sometimes in
the past. Other adjustments might be made through war or the threat of
war, as also happened in the past. The biggest illusion is to imagine
that as American power declines, the world stays the same. [What has
been true since the time of Rome remains true today: There can be no
world order without power to preserve it, to shape its norms, uphold its
institutions, defend the sinews of its economic system and keep the
peace]{.underline}. [Military power can be abused, wielded unwisely and
ineffectively. It can be deployed to answer problems that it cannot
answer or that have no answer. But it is also essential. No nation or
group of nations that renounced power could expect to maintain any kind
of world order]{.underline}. **[If the United States begins to look like
a less reliable defender of the present order, that order will begin to
unravel. People might indeed find Americans very attractive in this
weaker state, but if the United States cannot help them when and where
they need help the most, they will make other
arrangements.]{.underline}**

#### The project of securitization is a process of disavowal of the inevitable antagonisms produced by Capital---insecurity is inevitable in a world of capitalism 

**Taylor '09** (Marcus, Dept of Dev. Studies, Queen's University,
"Displacing Insecurity in a Divided World", Third World Quarterly, Vol.
30, No. 1)

Sandwiched between a gourmet buffet lunch and an eight-course, 19-dish
dinner prepared by 25 chefs, the [[G8 leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} met
at a special session of the 2008 Hokkaido summit to ponder the threat
posed by escalating food prices and to forge a globally co-ordinated
response.2 Between bites of sea urchin and milk-fed lamb, the leaders
[[discussed the magnitude of the crisis and appropriate]{.mark} policy
[responses]{.mark}.]{.underline} They had much to be concerned about.
[[The simultaneous]{.mark} food [crisis]{.mark}, oil price hikes and
credit crunch had [laid bare]{.mark} some of [the central contradictions
of contemporary capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [bringing to the fore
the insecurity that afflicts the lives of the global
majority]{.underline}. Steeply rising prices for basic foodstuffs
continued to squeeze the growing ranks of urban poor and rural
proletariat across the global South, while the credit crunch reflected
the failure of fostering consumption across low-wage America through a
proliferation of loans. Simultaneously the rising price of oil
threatened to heighten inflationary impulses while draining the
financial reserves of developing countries that habitually subsidise
fuel costs. [The [reaction of the international institutions]{.mark} of
global governance [had been]{.mark} characterised by uncertainty and
[plagued by a fear of global instability]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[As]{.underline} spiralling [food prices prompted protests across the
global South]{.underline}, [international policy makers fretted over the
security implications]{.underline} of the crisis. Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the IMF, warned that some
countries were now at 'a tipping point' because of the impact of rising
food and oil prices, while his counterpart at the World Bank, Robert
Zoellick, talked of the world entering a 'danger zone' and UN General
Secretary Ban Ki-moon pronounced that rising food prices 'could have
grave implications for international security, economic growth and
social progress'.3 Most poignantly, the Financial Times cited one
Washington official who claimed that countries such as China, India,
Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia could not bear the burden of a medium to
long-term confluence of oil and food prices, leading to a 'real security
issue where the streets are talking to the president'.4 In this
contribution I argue that [[framing the current crisis in]{.mark} terms
of [security forms part of an overarching technology of power]{.mark}
that is [deployed to reinforce]{.mark} the political foundations of
[the]{.mark} contemporary [capitalist order. By exceptionalising the
current crisis as a temporary breach with an existing rational social
order,]{.mark} the discourse of [security]{.mark} seeks to [normalise
the global status quo and legitimise]{.mark} a series of [actions to
securitise it.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is evident in the G8's response
to the food crisis, which located the causes of generalised food
insecurity in external shocks to an otherwise rational food system.
Despite Robert Zoellick's call for a 'new deal' on food, the global poor
would have to make do with a familiar dish. The G8's analysis led
inexorably towards a measured securitisation process that transferred
existing develop- ment aid into IMF-managed loans to prop up
impoverished food importing countries, while bolstering the corporate
agenda of liberalisation and a second 'green revolution' founded upon
biotechnology.5 'Food security' is therefore translated into a process
of securing markets for the international agribusiness oligopoly,
notwithstanding the substantive irrationalities of a crisis in which
agro-corporations enjoyed record profits while the global poor faced
deepening immiseration.6 [[That]{.mark} the discourse of
[security]{.mark} should [be fine tuned to upholding]{.mark} the
security of [markets is not an accident of history but]{.mark} is
[integral to the liberal vision of development.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[While critical development theorists have noted the overlap and
potential contradictions between the discourses of security and
development, they tend to elide the essential inseparability of the
two]{.underline}.7 As Mark Neocleous has persuasively argued, [the idea
of [security is the supreme concept of bourgeois society]{.mark}, in
which it is [identified with the freedom]{.mark} and liberty [to pursue
individual self-interest]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}8 [Within the
development industry this is reflected in the fashionable notion of
'human security', which critiques the state-centric predilections of
mainstream security studies by grounding the notion of security in the
establishment of individual freedoms.]{.underline} In so doing,
[[proponents of human security present a vision of social
evolution]{.mark} virtually [indistinguishable from]{.mark} the
[liberal]{.mark} notion of [development]{.mark}. Human security is
argued to encompass a transition towards 'human rights, good governance,
access to education and health care, and ensuring that each individual
has opportunities and choices to fulfil his or her own
potential']{.underline}.9 [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} [is a
[discourse]{.mark}]{.underline} [that]{.underline} the World Bank and
other international institutions have been keen to adopt because it
[[legitimises the imposition]{.mark} and reproduction [of capitalist
social relations]{.mark} as the driving force of
development]{.underline}. For the Bank development requires the removal
of the social and political barriers that inhibit market participation
by individuals who hold rights to private property and are secure from
coercion by other individuals, social groups or the state.10 As I
discuss in the first section below, [the liberal notion of security is
therefore intrinsic to the practices of capitalist development and
underscores the current international development project]{.underline}.
On the one hand, the IMF and World Bank deploy carrot and stick tactics
that compel peripheral states to reproduce the institutional basis for
market order through neoliberal reforms. On the other, the disciplinary
mechanisms of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are used to enforce the
intensive and extensive imposition of property rights across the world
market. Together [[these processes]{.mark} drive on the primitive
accumulation of capital and [consolidate a global apparatus of market
rule through which]{.mark} the human and natural [resources]{.mark}
necessary [for]{.mark} the [endless accumulation]{.mark} of capital [can
be incorporated under]{.mark} the power of [world money and fed into
global divisions of production]{.mark} and consumption. [A fundamental
tension emerges]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[between the liberal
discourse of security]{.mark}, rationality and development, [and]{.mark}
a [capitalist]{.mark} world [order in which social need is subordinated
to]{.mark} the [endless accumulation]{.mark} of capital.]{.underline} In
contrast to the idealised representations of a society composed of
private property owners bound together through mutually beneficial
market exchanges, [global [capitalism]{.mark} operates through
substantive relationships of power, exploitation and
domination]{.underline}. [It consequently produces and [reproduces
insecurity as an integral part of its modus
operandi]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The bourgeois [aspiration for
security]{.mark} and development [is]{.mark} therefore a [necessarily
contradictory]{.mark} project]{.underline} and, as I argue below, [the
[imposition of security translates into]{.mark} a process of
[externalising insecurity and displacing it onto those with few means to
resist]{.mark} effectively]{.underline}. I analyse this tendency along
two axes. On the one hand, [the continual reformulation of the
international division of labour [rests on the creation of labour forces
ridden by insecurity]{.mark} in order [to forge]{.mark} a [new]{.mark}
social standard of [exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The security of
capital accumulation therefore mirrors the insecurity of global labour,
as evidenced through vulnerability to coercion, insecurity of contract,
low wages and the absence of social protections. On the other, [[the
reproduction of Western mass consumption]{.mark} necessarily [involves
the displacement of the ecological burden onto those whose]{.mark}
social [existence is already precarious]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
most evident in the spatial and temporal displacement of the costs of
CO2 emissions, whereby global warming threatens to rupture the
socio-ecological foundations of rural livelihoods across much of the
global South. [[To securitise capitalist world
order]{.mark},]{.underline} therefore[, [is a continuous]{.mark} and
contradictory [process of]{.mark} displacing and [managing insecurity
through]{.mark} a combination of [institution building, social
engineering and the deployment of coercive
power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The question facing the
institutional bodies of world order, however, is whether this process is
reaching its social and ecological limits.]{.underline}

#### Understanding history through the lens of labor is key to disrupting the social totality and producing an emancipatory act.

Marxism and Why it Matters Now More Than Ever Before")
<http://www.redcritique.org/spring2001/whatisorthodoxmarxism.htm>

Any effective political theory will have to do at least two things: it
will have to offer an integrated understanding of social practices and,
based on such an interrelated knowledge, offer a guideline for praxis.
My main argument here is that among all contesting social theories now,
**[only Orthodox Marxism has been able to produce an integrated
knowledge of the existing social totality]{.underline}** and provide
lines of praxis that will lead to building a society free from
necessity.But first I must clarify what I mean by Orthodox Marxism. Like
all other modes and forms of political theory, the very theoretical
identity of Orthodox Marxism is itself contested---not just from non-and
anti-Marxists who question the very \"real\" (by which they mean the
\"practical\" as under free-market criteria) existence of any kind of
Marxism now but, perhaps more tellingly, from within the Marxist
tradition itself. I will, therefore, first say what I regard to be the
distinguishing marks of Orthodox Marxism and then outline a short
polemical map of contestation over Orthodox Marxism within the Marxist
theories now. I will end by arguing for its effectivity in bringing
about a new society based not on human rights but on freedom from
necessity. I will argue that **[to know contemporary
society]{.underline}**---and to be able to act on such
knowledge---[**one has to** first of all **know what makes the existing
social totality**.]{.underline} I will argue **that [the dominant social
totality is based on inequality]{.underline}**[---]{.underline}not just
inequality of power but inequality **[of economic access]{.underline}**
(which then determines access to health care, education, housing, diet,
transportation, . . . ). [**This systematic inequality cannot be
explained by gender, race, sexuality, disability, ethnicity, or
nationality.** These are all secondary contradictions and are all
determined by the fundamental contradiction of capitalism which is
inscribed in the relation of capital and labor.]{.underline} All modes
of Marxism now explain social inequalities primarily on the basis of
these secondary contradictions and in doing so---and this is my main
argument---legitimate capitalism. Why? Because such arguments authorize
capitalism without gender, race, discrimination and thus accept economic
inequality as an integral part of human societies. They accept a sunny
capitalism---a capitalism beyond capitalism. Such a society, based on
cultural equality but economic inequality, has always been the
not-so-hidden agenda of the bourgeois left---whether it has been called
\"new left,\" \"postmarxism,\" or \"radical democracy.\" This is, by the
way, the main reason for its popularity in the culture industry---from
the academy (Jameson, Harvey, Haraway, Butler,. . . ) to daily politics
(Michael Harrington, Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson,. . . ) to. . . . For
all, capitalism is here to stay and the best that can be done is to make
its cruelties more tolerable, more humane. This humanization (not
eradication) of capitalism is the sole goal of ALL contemporary lefts
(marxism, feminism, anti-racism, queeries, . . . ). Such an
understanding of social inequality is based on the fundamental
understanding that the source of wealth is human knowledge and not human
labor. That is, wealth is produced by the human mind and is thus free
from the actual objective conditions that shape the historical relations
of labor and capital. [Only **Orthodox Marxism recognizes the
historicity of labor and its primacy as the source of all human
wealth.**]{.underline} In this paper I argue that [**any emancipatory
theory has to be founded on recognition of the priority of Marx\'s labor
theory of value and not repeat the technological determinism of
corporate theory (\"knowledge work\") that masquerades as social
theory.**]{.underline} Finally, it is only Orthodox Marxism that
recognizes the inevitability and also the necessity of communism---the
necessity, that is, of a society in which \"from each according to their
ability to each according to their needs\" (Marx) is the rule. Two Why
Everyone has Suddenly Become an Orthodox Marxist A parody of politics
has taken over left politics in the U.S. and Europe. A parody in
which---after the dead-end of the designer socialisms of
postmarxisms---suddenly *everyone* is an \"orthodox\" Marxist: from
Zizek who in the introduction to a selection of his work writes of the
need to \"return to the centrality of the Marxist critique of political
economy\" (*Reader* ix); to Michael Sprinker who referred to himself as
a \"neo-conservative marxist\" (*\"*Forum*\"* 68). In calling himself a
\"neoconservative\" Sprinker was embracing with pride Butler\'s
definition of the term in her \"Merely Cultural\" in which she equates
it with \"leftist orthodoxy\" (268). Then there is Paul Smith who now,
after mocking Orthodox Marxism in *Discerning the Subject* and
*Universal Abandon*, says he has a \"fairly orthodox understanding of
what Marx and the Marxist tradition has had to say about capitalism\"
(*Millennial Dreams* 3). Parody is always the effect of a slippage and
the slippage here is that in spite of the sudden popularity of
\"orthodox\" Marxism, the *actual* theories and practices of the newly
orthodox are more than ever before *flexodox*. It seems as if once more
Lenin\'s notion that **[when the class antagonism emerges more sharply
\"the liberals. . . dare not deny the class struggle, but attempt to
narrow down \[and\] to curtail. . . the concept\" (\"Liberal and Marxist
Conceptions of the Class Struggle,\" 122) has been proven by
history]{.underline}.** \"Orthodox\" Marxism has become the latest cover
by which the bourgeois left authenticates its credentials and proceeds
to legitimate the economics of the ruling class and its anti-proletarian
politics. Take Paul Smith, for example. In Orthodox Marxism class is the
central issue. (I put aside here that in his writings, on subjectivity
for example, Smith has already gotten rid of the \"central\" by a
deconstructive logic). What Smith does with class is a rather
interesting test of how Orthodox Marxism is being used to legitimate the
class interests of the owners. Smith reworks class and turns it into a
useless Habermasian communicative act. He writes that \"classes are what
are formed in struggle, not something that exists prior to struggle\"
(*Millennial Dreams* 60). To say it again: the old ideological
textualization of the \"new left\" is not working any more (just look at
the resistance against globalization), so the ruling class is now
reworking the \"old left\" to defend itself. Against the Orthodox
Marxist theory of class, Smith evacuates class of an objective basis in
the extraction of surplus labor in production, and makes it the effect
of local conflicts. In short, Smith reverses the Orthodox Marxist
position that, \"It is not the consciousness of men that determines
their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines
their consciousness\" (Marx, *Contribution*, 21), and turns it into a
neomarxist view that what matters is their consciousness. In this he in
fact shares a great deal with conservative theories that make \"values\"
(the subjective) as what matters in social life and *not* economic
access. Zizek provides another example of the flexodox parody of Marxism
today. [**Capitalism in Orthodox Marxism is explained as an historical
mode of production based on the privatization of the means of
subsistence in the hands of a few, i.e., the systemic exploitation of
labor by capital.**]{.underline} Capitalism is the world-historic regime
of unpaid surplus-labor. In Zizek\'s writings, capitalism is not based
on exploitation in production (surplus-labor), but on struggles over
consumption (\"surplus-enjoyment\"). The Orthodox Marxist concepts that
lay bare the exploitative production relations in order to change them
are thus replaced with a \"psycho-marxist\" pastiche of consumption in
his writings, a revisionist move that has proven immensely successful in
the bourgeois cultural criticism. Zizek, however, has taken to
representing this displacement of labor (production) with desire
(consumption) as \"strictly correlative\" to the concept of
\"revolutionary praxis\" found in the texts of Orthodox Marxism (e.g.,
\"Repeating Lenin\"). **[Revolutionary practice is always informed by
class consciousness]{.underline}** and transformative cultural critique
has always aimed at producing class consciousness by laying bare the
false consciousness that ruling ideology institutes in the everyday.
Transformative cultural critique, in other words, is always a linking of
consciousness to production practices from which a knowledge of social
totality emerges. Zizek, however, long ago abandoned Orthodox Marxist
ideology critique as an epistemologically naïve theory of \"ideology\"
because it could not account for the persistence of \"desire\" beyond
critique (the \"enlightened false-consciousness\" of *The Sublime Object
of Ideology*, *Mapping Ideology*,. . . ). His more recent \"return to
the centrality of the Marxist critique\" is, as a result, a purely
tropic voluntarism of the kind he endlessly celebrates in his
diffusionist readings of culture as desire-al moments when social norms
are violated and personal emotions spontaneously experienced as
absolutely compulsory (as \"drive\"). His concept of revolutionary
Marxist praxis consists of re-describing it as an \"excessive\"
lifestyle choice (analogous to pedophilia and other culturally
marginalized practices, *The Ticklish Subject* 381-8). On this reading,
Marxism is the only metaphorical displacement of \"desire\" into
\"surplus-pleasure\" that makes imperative the \"direct socialization of
the productive process\" (*Ticklish Subject* 350) and that thus causes
the subjects committed to it to experience a Symbolic death at the hands
of the neoliberal culture industry. It is this \"affirmative\" reversal
of the right-wing anti-Marxist narrative that makes Zizek\'s writings so
highly praised in the bourgeois \"high-theory\" market---where it is
read as \"subtle\" and an example of \"deep thinking\" because it
confirms a transcendental position considered above politics by making
all politics ideological. If everything is ideology then there can be no
fundamental social change only formal repetition and reversal of values
(Nietzsche). Zizek\'s pastiche of psycho-marxism thus consists in
presenting what is only theoretically possible for the
capitalist---those few who have already met, in excess, their material
needs through the exploitation of the labor of the other and who can
therefore afford to elaborate fantasies of desire---as a universal form
of agency freely available to everyone. .

#### Only historical analysis centered on economic inequality can conceptualize class structures -- prerequisite to emancipatory action.

Marxism and Why it Matters Now More Than Ever Before")
<http://www.redcritique.org/spring2001/whatisorthodoxmarxism.htm>

My larger point is of course that the most effective writings for the
ruling class are located in the middle register, in that register of
writing usually praised as lucid, clear, jargon-free and above all
\"readable.\" Zizek is abstract; Hennessy is concrete. This is another
way of saying that the work of Hennessy and other such \"tamers\" of
Marxism is always a work of synthesis and consolidation---they make
concrete the work of high theory: it is for this reason that their work
forms the very center of the culture industry. Finally, to be clear, the
question here is not to play a game of determining the \"good\" from the
\"bad\" Marxism[[. What is good Marxism---what is effective in
overcoming inequality---is determined by history
itself.]{.underline}]{.mark} The question is whether what is being done
actualizes the historical potential made possible by the development of
the forces of production and thus brings about change in the existing
social relations of production (overcomes class inequality) or whether
it plays within the existing actuality and thus turns the limits of the
actually existing into the very limits of reality as such. And in doing
so, reifies the present social relations of production. Flexodox
Marxists like Hennessy accept the proposition that capitalism is here to
stay and thus reject as \"impractical\" any pressure put on the external
supports of capitalism (capital and labor relations) and then work
within capitalism---on the basis of community and emotional
intensity---to make its ongoing process of the exploitation of the labor
of the world\'s workers more \"humane\" and tolerable. Capitalism is,
according to Hennessy\'s soap-operatic leftism, something that one
should always keep in mind but not seriously consider overthrowing. She
is too cynical to take even her own views seriously: \"This means that
eliminating the social structures of exploitation that capitalism
absolutely requires and so violently enacts at the expense of human
needs must be on the political agenda, at the every least as the horizon
that sets the terms for imagining change\" (232). Capitalist
exploitation is a heuristic consideration not a revolutionary
imperative. Beyond the theatrical moves of the bourgeois left, however,
Orthodox Marxism is emerging as the only understanding of the new global
formations that lead to transformative praxis. Orthodox Marxism has
become impossible to ignore because the objective possibility of
transforming the regime of wage-labor into a system in which the
priority is not profit but meeting the needs of all is confronted as a
daily actuality. The flexodox left turns the emergent class struggles
into self-enclosed struggles for symbolic power so to represent class
hegemony in the relations of production as capable of being changed
through cross-class \"coalitions\" when in fact exploitation is
everywhere in the world maintained by such coalitions which are loosing
their legitimacy and breaking apart under the weight of their own
contradictions precisely because the class divide is growing under their
rule and beyond their borders. Orthodox Marxism demonstrates that the
productive forces of capitalism have reached tremendous levels and have
the ability to feed, clothe, and house the world many times over but are
fettered by capitalism\'s existing social relations: its fundamental
drive to privately consume the social resources of collective labor.
That the left today has, in dramatic fashion, been forced to return (if
only rhetorically) to Orthodox Marxism marks the fact that the struggle
to transform capitalism has reached a stage of development that
necessitates a systemic theoretical basis for revolutionary praxis. The
hegemonic left now wants to incorporate Orthodox Marxism into its
dogmatic coalitional logic as a discourse which depends for its identity
on \"class\" as \"real\": which is a code for the \"lived experience\"
or the transcendental ineffable politics (Lacan) of class as an outside
inferred from the inside (the side of subjective \"values\") and as such
held to be unavailable for positive knowing. Which is another way of
saying that class is a matter of \"persuasion\" and \"seduction\" rather
than production. What the resulting flexodox marxism cannot explain
therefore is that class is not a matter of what this or that proletarian
or even the proletariat **as a whole *pictures* as its goal. [It is a
matter of *what the proletariat is in actuality* and what, in accordance
with this *being*, it will historically be compelled to
do]{.underline}** (*Marx-Engels Reader* 135). Orthodox Marxism does not
consist of raising \"class\" as a dogmatic banner of the \"real,\" but
in the critique of false consciousness that divides the workers by
occulting their collective interest by shifting the focus from their
position in social production, their *material* antagonism with the
capitalist class. \"Class as real\" (a spectral agency) cannot explain,
and therefore cannot engage in, the material process through which
capitalism, by its very own laws of motion, produces its own
\"gravedigger\" in the global proletariat. What the flexodox return to
and hollowing out of the concepts of Orthodox Marxism proves, among
other things, is that \"the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch
the ruling ideas\" (Marx and Engels, *The German Ideology* 67) and
history progresses despite this ideological hegemony through the agency
of labor. In short[[---\"The history of all hitherto existing society is
the history of class struggles.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Four Without
Revolutionary Theory There Can Be No Revolutionary Movement Orthodox
Marxism has become a test-case of the \"radical\" today. Yet, what
passes for orthodoxy on the left---whether like Smith and Zizek they
claim to support it, or, like Butler and Rorty they want to \"achieve
our country\" by excluding it from \"U.S. Intellectual life\" (\"On Left
Conservatism\"), is a *parody* of orthodoxy which *hybridizes* its
central concepts and renders them into flexodox simulations. Yet, even
in its very textuality, however, the orthodox is a resistance to the
flexodox. Contrary to the common-sensical view of \"orthodox\" as
\"traditional\" or \"conformist\" \"opinions,\" is its *other* meaning:
ortho-doxy not as flexodox \"hybridity,\" but as \"original\" \"ideas.\"
\"Original,\" not in the sense of epistemic \"event,\" \"authorial\"
originality and so forth, but, as in chemistry, in its opposition to
\"para,\" \"meta,\" \"post\" and other ludic hybridities: thus \"ortho\"
as resistance to the annotations that mystify the *original ideas* of
*Marxism* and hybridize it for the \"special interests\" of various
groups. The \"original\" ideas of Marxism are inseparable from their
effect as \"demystification\" of ideology---for example the deployment
of \"class\" that allows a demystification of daily life from the haze
of consumption. *Class* is thus an \"original idea\" of Marxism in the
sense that it cuts through the hype of cultural agency under capitalism
and reveals how culture and consumption are tied to *labor*, the
everyday determined by the workday: how the amount of time workers spend
engaging in surplus-labor determines the amount of time they get for
reproducing and cultivating their needs. Without changing this division
of labor social change is impossible. Orthodoxy is a rejection of the
ideological annotations: hence, on the one hand, the resistance to
orthodoxy as \"rigid\" and \"dogmatic\" \"determinism,\" and, on the
other, its hybridization by the flexodox as the result of which it has
become almost *impossible* today to read the original ideas of Marxism,
such as \"exploitation\"; \"surplus-value\"; \"class\"; \"class
antagonism\"; \"class struggle\"; \"revolution\"; \"science\" (i.e.,
objective knowledge); \"ideology\" (as \"false consciousness\"). Yet, it
is these ideas *alone* that clarify the *elemental* truths through which
theory *ceases* to be a gray activism of tropes, desire and affect, and
becomes, instead, a red, revolutionary guide to praxis for a new society
freed from exploitation and injustice. Marx\'s original scientific
discovery was his labor theory of value. Marx\'s labor theory of value
is an elemental truth of Orthodox Marxism that is rejected by the
flexodox left as the central dogmatism of a \"totalitarian\" Marxism. It
is only Marx\'s labor theory of value, however, that exposes the
mystification of the wages system that disguises exploitation as a
\"fair exchange\" between capital and labor and reveals the truth about
this relation as one of exploitation. Only Orthodox Marxism explains how
what the workers sell to the capitalist is not labor, a commodity like
any other whose price is determined by fluctuations in supply and
demand, but their labor-power---their ability to labor in a system which
has systematically \"freed\" them from the means of production so they
are forced to work or starve---whose value is determined by the amount
of time socially necessary to reproduce it daily. The value of
labor-power is equivalent to the value of wages workers consume daily in
the form of commodities that keep them alive to be exploited tomorrow.
Given the technical composition of production today this amount of time
is a slight fraction of the workday the majority of which workers spend
producing surplus-value over and above their needs. The surplus-value is
what is pocketed by the capitalists in the form of profit when the
commodities are sold. Class is the antagonistic division thus
established between the exploited and their exploiters. Without Marx\'s
labor theory of value one could only contest the after effects of this
outright theft of social labor-power rather than its cause lying in the
private ownership of production. The flexodox rejection of the labor
theory of value as the \"dogmatic\" core of a totalitarian Marxism
therefore is a not so subtle rejection of the principled defense of the
(scientific) knowledge workers need for their emancipation from
exploitation because only the labor theory of value exposes the
opportunism of knowledges (ideology) that occult this exploitation.
Without the labor theory of value socialism would only be a moral dogma
that appeals to the sentiments of \"fairness\" and \"equality\" for a
\"just\" distribution of the social wealth that does the work of capital
by naturalizing the exploitation of labor under capitalism giving it an
acceptable \"human face.\" It is [**only Orthodox Marxism that explains
socialism as an historical inevitability that is tied to the development
of social production itself and its requirements**.]{.underline}
Orthodox Marxism makes socialism scientific because it explains how in
the capitalist system, based on the private consumption of labor-power
(competition), the objective tendency is to reduce the amount of time
labor spends in reproducing itself (necessary labor) while expanding the
amount of time labor is engaged in producing surplus-value
(surplus-labor) for the capitalist through the introduction of machinery
into the production process by the capitalists themselves to lower their
own labor costs. **[[Because of the competitive drive for profits under
capitalism it is historically *inevitable* that a point is reached when
the technical mastery]{.mark}---the amount of time socially necessary on
average to meet the needs of society through the processing of natural
resources---[is such that the conditions of the workers worsen relative
to the owners and becomes an unbearable global social
contradiction]{.mark} in the midst of the ever greater mass of wealth
produced. It is therefore just as inevitable that at such a moment it
obviously makes more sense to socialize production and meet the needs of
all to avoid the explosive social conflicts]{.underline}** perpetually
generated by private property than to maintain the system at the risk of
total social collapse on a world scale. \"Socialism or barbarism\"
(Luxemburg) is the inevitable choice faced by humanity because of
capitalism. Either maintain private property and the exploitation of
labor in production, in which case more and more social resources will
go into policing the growingly desperate surplus-population generated by
the technical efficiency of social production, or socialize production
and inaugurate a society whose founding principle is \"from each
according to his ability, to each according to his needs\" (Marx,
*Critique of the Gotha Program*, *Selected Works*, 325) and \"in which
the free development of each is the condition for the free development
of all\" (*Manifesto of the Communist Party*, *Selected Works*, 53). The
time has come to state it clearly so that even the flexodox opportunists
may grasp it: **[Orthodox Marxism]{.underline}** is not a free-floating
\"language-game\" or \"meta-narrative\" for arbitrarily constructing
local utopian communities or spectral activist inversions of ideology
meant to seduce \"desire\" and \"mobilize\" (glorify) subjectivity---it
[**is an absolute prerequisite for our emancipation from exploitation
and a new society freed from necessity! Orthodox Marxism is the only
global theory of social change. Only Orthodox Marxism has explained why
under the system of wage-labor and capital**]{.underline} communism is
not \"an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself\" but \"the
*real* movement which abolishes the present state of things\" (*The
German Ideology* 57) because of its objective explanation of and
ceaseless commitment to \"the self-conscious, independent movement of
the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority\"
(*Manifesto of the Communist Party*, *Selected Works*, 45) to end social
inequality forever.

[In]{.underline} these mean streets of [globalized capitalism in crisis,
it has become profitable to turn poverty and inequality into a tourist
attraction]{.underline}. The South African Emoya Luxury Hotel and Spa
company has made a glamorized spectacle of it. The resort recently
advertised an opportunity for tourists to stay \"in our unique Shanty
Town \... and experience traditional township living within a safe
private game reserve environment.\" A cluster of simulated shanties
outside of Bloemfontein that the company has constructed \"is ideal for
team building, braais, bachelors \[parties\], theme parties and an
experience of a lifetime,\" read the ad. The luxury accommodations, made
to appear from the outside as shacks, featured paraffin lamps, candles,
a battery-operated radio, an outside toilet, a drum and fireplace for
cooking, as well as under-floor heating, air conditioning and wireless
internet access. A well-dressed, young white couple is pictured
embracing in a field with the corrugated tin shanties in the background.
The only thing missing in this fantasy world of sanitized space and
glamorized poverty was the people themselves living in poverty.
Escalating inequalities fuel capitalism\'s chronic problem of
over-accumulation. [The \"luxury shanty town\" in South Africa is a
fitting metaphor for global capitalism as a whole]{.underline}. **[Faced
with a stagnant global economy, elites have managed to turn war,
structural violence and inequality into opportunities for capital,
pleasure and entertainment]{.underline}**. [It is hard not to conclude
that unchecked capitalism has become what I term \"sadistic
capitalism,\" in which the suffering and deprivation]{.underline}
generated by capitalism [become a source of aesthetic
pleasure]{.underline}, leisure and entertainment [for
others]{.underline}. [I recently had the opportunity to travel through
several countries]{.underline} in Latin America, the Middle East, North
Africa, East Asia and throughout North America. I was on sabbatical to
research what the global crisis looks like on the ground around the
world. [Everywhere I went, social polarization and political tensions
have reached **explosive dimensions.**]{.underline} Where is the crisis
headed, what are the possible outcomes and what does it tell us about
global capitalism and resistance? [[This crisis]{.mark} is not like
earlier structural crises]{.underline} of world capitalism, such as in
the 1930s or 1970s. [This one [is fast becoming
systemic]{.mark}.]{.underline} The crisis of humanity shares aspects of
earlier structural crises of world capitalism, but [there are six
novel]{.underline}, interrelated [dimensions]{.underline} to the current
moment that I highlight here, in broad strokes, as the \"big picture\"
context in which countries and peoples around the world are experiencing
a descent into chaos and uncertainty. 1) [The level of global social
polarization and inequality is unprecedented]{.underline} in the face of
out-of-control, over-accumulated capital. In January 2016, the
development agency Oxfam published a follow-up to its report on global
inequality that had been released the previous year. According to the
new report, now just [62 billionaires]{.underline} \-- down from 80
identified by the agency in its January 2015 report \-- [control as much
wealth as one half of the world\'s population, and the top 1% owns more
wealth than the other 99% combined]{.underline}. Beyond the
transnational capitalist class and the upper echelons of the global
power bloc, the richest 20 percent of humanity owns some 95 percent of
the world\'s wealth, while the bottom 80 percent has to make do with
just 5 percent. [This 20-80 divide of global society into haves and the
have-nots is the new global social apartheid]{.underline}. It is evident
not just between rich and poor countries, but within each country, North
and South, with the rise of new affluent high-consumption sectors
alongside the downward mobility, \"precariatization,\" destabilization
and expulsion of majorities. [[Escalating inequalities fuel
capitalism\'s]{.mark} chronic [problem of
over-accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}: The transnational capitalist
class cannot find productive outlets to unload the enormous amounts of
surplus it has accumulated[, [leading to stagnation in the world
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The signs of an impending depression are
everywhere.]{.underline} The front page of the February 20 issue of The
Economist read, \"The World Economy: Out of Ammo?\" [Extreme levels of
social polarization present a challenge to dominant groups]{.underline}.
[They strive to purchase the loyalty of that 20 percent, while at the
same time dividing the 80 percent, co-opting some into a hegemonic bloc
and repressing the rest.]{.underline} **[Alongside the spread of
frightening new systems of social control and repression is heightened
dissemination through the culture industries and corporate marketing
strategies that depoliticize through consumerist fantasies and the
manipulation of desire]{.underline}**. [As \"Trumpism]{.underline}\" in
the United States so well [illustrates]{.underline}, [another strategy
of co-optation is the manipulation of fear and insecurity]{.underline}
among the downwardly mobile [so that [social anxiety is channeled toward
scapegoated communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This psychosocial
mechanism of [displacing mass anxieties]{.mark} is not new, but it
[appears to be **increasing**]{.mark} **around the world in the face of
the structural destabilization of capitalist
globalization.**]{.underline} Scapegoated communities are under siege,
such as the Rohingya in Myanmar, the Muslim minority in India, the Kurds
in Turkey, southern African immigrants in South Africa, and Syrian and
Iraqi refugees and other immigrants in Europe. As with its 20th century
predecessor, [[21st century fascism hinges on]{.mark} such [manipulation
of social anxiety]{.mark} at a time of acute capitalist crisis.
**Extreme [inequality requires extreme violence]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
repression that lend to projects of 21st century fascism.]{.underline}
2) [[The system is]{.mark} fast [reaching]{.mark} the [ecological
limits]{.mark} to its reproduction]{.underline}. [We have reached
several tipping points in what environmental scientists refer to as nine
crucial \"planetary boundaries.]{.underline}\" We have already exceeded
these boundaries in three areas \-- climate change, the nitrogen cycle
and diversity loss. There have been five previous mass extinctions in
earth\'s history. While all these were due to natural causes, [for the
first time ever, human conduct is intersecting with and fundamentally
altering the earth system.]{.underline} We have entered what Paul
Crutzen, the Dutch environmental scientist and Nobel Prize winner,
termed the Anthropocene \-- a new age in which humans have transformed
up to half of the world\'s surface. [[We are altering the composition of
the atmosphere and acidifying the oceans at a rate that undermines the
conditions for life.]{.mark} The ecological dimensions of global crisis
cannot be understated.]{.underline} \"We are deciding, without quite
meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will
forever be closed,\" observes Elizabeth Kolbert in her best seller, The
Sixth Extinction. \"No other creature has ever managed this \... The
Sixth Extinction will continue to determine the course of life long
after everything people have written and painted and built has been
ground into dust.\" Capitalism cannot be held solely responsible. The
human-nature contradiction has deep roots in civilization itself. The
ancient Sumerian empires, for example, collapsed after the population
over-salinated their crop soil. The Mayan city-state network collapsed
about AD 900 due to deforestation. And the former Soviet Union wrecked
havoc on the environment. However, **[given capital\'s implacable
impulse to accumulate profit and its accelerated commodification of
nature, it is difficult to imagine that the environmental catastrophe
can be resolved within the capitalist system]{.underline}**. \"[[Green
capitalism\" appears as an oxymoron]{.mark}, as sadistic [capitalism\'s
attempt to turn the ecological crisis **into a profit-making
opportunity**, along with the conversion of poverty into a tourist
attraction]{.mark}.]{.underline} 3) **[The sheer magnitude of the means
of violence is unprecedented]{.underline}**, [as is the concentrated
control over the means of global communications and the production and
circulation of knowledge, symbols and images.]{.underline} [We have seen
the spread of frightening new systems of social control and repression
that have brought us into the panoptical surveillance society and the
age of thought contro]{.underline}l. This real-life Orwellian world is
in a sense more perturbing than that described by George Orwell in his
iconic novel 1984. In that fictional world, people were compelled to
give their obedience to the state (\"Big Brother\") in exchange for a
quiet existence with guarantees of employment, housing and other social
necessities. Now, however, the corporate and political powers that be
force obedience even as the means of survival are denied to the vast
majority. Global apartheid involves the creation of \"green zones\" that
are cordoned off in each locale around the world where elites are
insulated through new systems of spatial reorganization, social control
and policing. \"Green zone\" refers to the nearly impenetrable area in
central Baghdad that US occupation forces established in the wake of the
2003 invasion of Iraq. The command center of the occupation and select
Iraqi elite inside that green zone were protected from the violence and
chaos that engulfed the country. Urban areas around the world are now
green zoned through gentrification, gated communities, surveillance
systems, and state and private violence. Inside the world\'s green
zones, privileged strata avail themselves of privatized social services,
consumption and entertainment. They can work and communicate through
internet and satellite sealed off under the protection of armies of
soldiers, police and private security forces. Green zoning takes on
distinct forms in each locality. In Palestine, I witnessed such zoning
in the form of Israeli military checkpoints, Jewish settler-only roads
and the apartheid wall. In Mexico City, the most exclusive residential
areas in the upscale Santa Fe District are accessible only by helicopter
and private gated roads. In Johannesburg, a surreal drive through the
exclusive Sandton City area reveals rows of mansions that appear as
military compounds, with private armed towers and electrical and
barbed-wire fences. In Cairo, I toured satellite cities ringing the
impoverished center and inner suburbs where the country\'s elite could
live out their aspirations and fantasies. They sport gated residential
complexes with spotless green lawns, private leisure and shopping
centers and English-language international schools under the protection
of military checkpoints and private security police. In other cities,
green zoning is subtler but no less effective. In Los Angeles, where I
live, the freeway system now has an express lane reserved for those that
can pay an exorbitant toll. On this lane, the privileged speed by, while
the rest remain one lane over, stuck in the city\'s notorious
bumper-to-bumper traffic \-- or even worse, in notoriously underfunded
and underdeveloped public transportation, where it may take half a day
to get to and from work. There is no barrier separating this express
lane from the others. However, a near-invisible closed surveillance
system monitors every movement. If a vehicle without authorization
shifts into the exclusive lane, it is instantly recorded by this
surveillance system and a heavy fine is imposed on the driver, under
threat of impoundment, while freeway police patrols are ubiquitous.
Outside of the global green zones, [[warfare and police containment have
become normalized]{.mark} and sanitized for those not directly at the
receiving end of armed aggression]{.underline}. [\"Militainment\" \--
portraying and even glamorizing war and violence as entertaining
spectacles]{.underline} through Hollywood films and television police
shows, computer games and corporate \"news\" channels \-- [may be the
epitome of sadistic capitalism. It desensitizes, bringing about
complacency and indifference. [In between the green zones and]{.mark}
outright [warfare are]{.mark} prison industrial complexes, [immigrant
and refugee repression]{.mark} and control systems, the criminalization
of outcast communities and capitalist schooling]{.underline}. [[The
omnipresent media]{.mark} and cultural apparatuses of the corporate
economy]{.underline}, in particular, **[aim to colonize the mind \-- to
[undermine the ability to think]{.mark} critically and [outside the
dominant worldview]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [[A neofascist
culture emerges through militarism]{.mark}, extreme masculinization,
racism and racist mobilizations against scapegoats.]{.underline} 4) [We
are reaching limits to the extensive expansion of
capitalism]{.underline}. [Capitalism is like riding a bicycle: When you
stop pedaling the bicycle, you fall over]{.underline}. **[[If the
capitalist system stops expanding outward, it enters crisis and faces
collapse.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [In each earlier structural crisis, the
system went through a new round of extensive expansion]{.underline} \--
from waves of colonial conquest in earlier centuries, to the integration
in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of the former socialist
countries, China, India and other areas that had been marginally outside
the system. **[There are no longer any new territories to integrate into
world capitalism.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, the privatization of
education, health care, utilities, basic services and public land are
turning those spaces in global society that were outside of capital\'s
control into \"spaces of capital.\" Even poverty has been turned into a
commodity. What is there left to commodify? Where can the system now
expand? **[[With the limits to expansion comes a turn toward militarized
accumulation]{.mark} \-- [making wars of endless destruction and
reconstruction]{.mark} and [expanding the militarization of social and
political institutions so as to continue to generate new opportunities
for accumulation in the face of stagnation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 5)
[[There is]{.mark} the rise of [a]{.mark} vast surplus [population
inhabiting]{.mark} a \"planet of [slums,\" alienated from the productive
economy]{.mark}, thrown into the margins and subject to these
sophisticated systems of **social control and
destruction**]{.underline}. Global capitalism has no direct use for
surplus humanity. But indirectly, [[it holds wages down everywhere and
makes]{.mark} new systems of [21st century slavery
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. These systems include prison labor, the
forced recruitment of miners at gunpoint by warlords contracted by
global corporations to dig up valuable minerals in the Congo, sweatshops
and exploited immigrant communities (including the rising tide of
immigrant female caregivers for affluent populations). Furthermore, the
global working class is experiencing accelerated \"precariatization.\"
The \"new precariat\" refers to the proletariat that faces capital under
today\'s unstable and precarious labor relations \-- informalization,
casualization, part-time, temp, immigrant and contract labor. As
communities are uprooted everywhere, there is a rising reserve army of
immigrant labor. The global working class is becoming divided into
citizen and immigrant workers. The latter are particularly attractive to
transnational capital, as the lack of citizenship rights makes them
particularly vulnerable, and therefore, exploitable. The challenge for
dominant groups is how to contain the real and potential rebellion of
surplus humanity, the immigrant workforce and the precariat. How can
they contain the explosive contradictions of this system? The [21st
century megacities become the battlegrounds between mass resistance
movements and the new systems of mass repression. Some
populations]{.underline} in these cities (and also in abandoned
countryside**[) are at risk of genocide]{.underline}**, such as those in
Gaza, zones in Somalia and Congo, and swaths of Iraq and Syria. 6)
[There is a disjuncture between a globalizing economy and a
nation-state-based system of political authority]{.underline}.
[Transnational state apparatuses are incipient and do not wield enough
power and authority to organize and stabilize the system, much less to
impose regulations on runaway transnational capital]{.underline}. In the
wake of the 2008 financial collapse, for instance, the governments of
the G-8 and G-20 were unable to impose transnational regulation on the
global financial system, despite a series of emergency summits to
discuss such regulation. [[Elites]{.mark} historically [have attempted
to resolve the problems of over-accumulation by state policies that can
regulate the anarchy of the market]{.mark}. However, [in recent decades,
transnational capital has broken free from the constraints]{.mark}
imposed by the nation-state]{.underline}. The more \"enlightened\" elite
representatives of the transnational capitalist class are now clamoring
for transnational mechanisms of regulation that would allow the global
ruling class to reign in the anarchy of the system in the interests of
saving global capitalism from itself and from radical challenges from
below. At the same time, the division of the world into some 200
competing nation-states is not the most propitious of circumstances for
the global working class. Victories in popular struggles from below in
any one country or region can (and often do) become diverted and even
undone by the structural power of transnational capital and the direct
political and military domination that this structural power affords the
dominant groups. In Greece, for instance, the leftist Syriza party came
to power in 2015 on the heels of militant worker struggles and a mass
uprising. But the party abandoned its radical program as a result of the
enormous pressure exerted on it from the European Central Bank and
private international creditors. The Systemic Critique of Global
Capitalism **[A growing number of transnational elites themselves now
recognize that [any resolution]{.mark} to the global crisis [must
involve redistribution downward of income]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
However, [in the viewpoint of those from below, a neo-Keynesian
redistribution within the prevailing corporate power structure is not
enough. What is required is a redistribution of power downward and
transformation toward a system in which social need trumps private
profit. **A global rebellion against the transnational capitalist class
has spread since the financial collapse of 2008**]{.underline}.
[Wherever one looks, there is popular, grassroots and leftist struggle,
and the rise of new cultures of resistance**: the Arab
Spring**]{.underline}; the resurgence of leftist **[politics in Greece,
Spain and elsewhere in Europe; the tenacious resistance of Mexican
social movements following the Ayotzinapa massacre of 2014; the favela
uprising in Brazil against the government\'s World Cup]{.underline}**
and Olympic expulsion policies; the student strikes in Chile; **[the
remarkable surge in the Chinese workers\' movement]{.underline}**; the
shack dwellers and other poor people\'s campaigns in South Africa;
**[Occupy Wall Street, the immigrant rights movement, Black Lives
Matter,]{.underline}** fast food workers\' struggle and the mobilization
around the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in the United States.
[This global revolt is spread unevenly and faces many
challenges.]{.underline} A number of these struggles, moreover, have
suffered setbacks, such as the Greek working-class movement and,
tragically, the Arab Spring. What type of a transformation is viable,
and how do we achieve it**[? How we interpret the global crisis is
itself a matter of vital importance]{.underline}** [as politics polarize
worldwide between a neofascist and a popular response. The systemic
critique of global capitalism must strive to influence, from this
vantage point, **[the discourse and practice of movements]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} a more just distribution of wealth and power. Our [survival
may depend on it.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

(Rob Wilkie is an english professor at the university of Wisconsin. He
publishes extensively on the works of Marx. "Spirit Objectified: The
\"Austerity\" Economics of \"New Materialism,\""
<http://www.redcritique.org/WinterSpring2014/spiritobjectified.htm>, JB)

\"[New Materialism\" is said by its advocates to provide a more
\"dynamic\" yet \"grounded\" approach to social issues than the past
half-century of \"playful\" bourgeois theory,]{.underline} and thus a
more responsible agent for the \"austerity\" age. The problem, as the
editors of the New Materialisms anthology claim, is that [we are now
facing a series of critical issues---from environmental destruction to
financial meltdow]{.underline}n---but if there is a lesson to be learned
from recent events associated with subprime lending and the consequent
banking crisis, it is how few people any longer grasp the complexities
of the deregulated financial system, and yet how many are affected in so
many places worldwide and in such immediately material ways, by any
hiatus in financial markets. (Coole and Frost 31) [In other words, the
more interconnected individuals are within the global system of
production, the less they understand it. It is such that the proponents
of New Materialism maintain that the very complexities of contemporary
life expose the impossibility of knowing the causes of the financial
crisis as part of any economic totality.]{.underline} They write
although \"[phenomena are caught in a multitude of interlocking systems
and forces\"]{.underline} (9[) the interconnected nature of reality
requires an \"eclectic combination of approaches\" (28) which combines
\"biopolitics, critical geopolitics, and political economy with
genealogies and phenomenologies of everyday life]{.underline}\" (28).
This hermeneutic eclecticism, they state, is necessary in order to
recognize the way in which any \"determination within dynamic systems is
nonlinear\" and thus \"terminal effects cannot be construed as
possibilities that were already latent in some initial moment\" (14). In
other words, there is no way of knowing or distinguishing cause from
effect, base from superstructure, economics from politics or culture.
[They conclude that \"no workable version\" of what they are calling
\"New Materialism\" will \"advance a historical
metanarrative]{.underline}, aspire to the identification of determining
economic laws, valorize an originary, pristine nature, or envisage
communism as history\'s idealized material destiny\" (30). [Far from
understanding the social totality, they are positing that the very
existence of the social totality is a paradox]{.underline}: an
\"absolute\" knowledge that society is a multiplicity which can never be
understood as such. In trying to appear \"relevant\" by talking about
issues of environmental catastrophe, financial crisis, and economic
inequality, they make sure to let their readers know they are \"beyond
Marx\" and are not committed to fighting against capitalism for the
revolutionary new that is socialism. In other words, [their
contradictory embrace of an non-causal materialism is not simply a
logical flaw in their argument---a theory undone by its own internal
aporias]{.underline}, as a deconstructionist might claim---**[but a
class-interested ideology that actively blocks knowledge of the social
totalit]{.underline}**y. [Despite the fact that]{.underline} \"the
problem of ambiguity is very real\"---that is to say, that [reality
is]{.underline} increasingly [complex---this does not mean that \"these
paradoxical manifestations must remain forever indecipherable and
unsettled]{.underline}\" (Novack 323). As Engels explains in response to
the limits of Kantianism, in Kant\'s time our knowledge of natural
objects was indeed so fragmentary that he might well suspect, behind the
little we knew about each of them, a mysterious \"thing-in-itself.\" But
one after another these ungraspable things have been grasped, analyzed,
and, what is more, reproduced by the giant progress of science; and what
we can produce we certainly cannot consider as unknowable.

cause and effect are blurred is in actuality an economic theory in which
the immaterialities of finance and consumption are presented as having
overcome the reality of production. This is the ideological reflection
of a reality devoid of labor in the interests of capital. It is by
blurring social relations behind a veil of transcendental materialism
that although such an approach might appear to some to be \"flexible\"
and \"open\" to \"new developments,\" it actually obscures the essential
basis of these \"new developments\" in the exploitation of
labor]{.underline}. The ideological implications of this logic are drawn
out and made clear in Jason Edwards\' contribution to the New
Materialisms collection, \"The Materialism of Historical Materialism.\"
He too suggests that [much of the political analysis that appears in
poststructuralist literature effectively resorts to a form of liberal
multicultural and identity politics that seems blind or indifferent to
the major problems faced by all humans today: climate change, global
inequality, forced migration and new forms of slavery, and the
proliferation of military technology and warfare]{.underline}. (282) In
contrast, Edwards claims to be concerned with producing \"an ongoing
analysis of the current social and political conditions of contemporary
capitalist societies in light of their historical development, their
embedded institutions and practices, and the contingent circumstances
that serve to reproduce them---or threaten their reproduction---over
time\" (282). What such [an analysis]{.underline} amounts to, he
proposes, [is the need to grasp capitalism as \"a complex
totality]{.underline}\" (286) in which \"the character of these
practices in any given setting is not easily or neatly drawn out on a
conceptual tableau in which the economic has primacy and is a straight
forward synonym of the material\" (284). He writes that \"the
materialism of [historical materialism should be seen as more of a
heuristic for social and political study, rather than a set of
explanatory theses]{.underline}\" (282). In other words, the role of
[theory should be to make]{.underline} educated[, experiential
guesses]{.underline} about reality with no hope of understanding how
different aspects of that reality are connected, [rather
than]{.underline} attempt [to]{.underline} understand and [explain
reality as a totality]{.underline}. It is in this context that we can
begin to see the way in which what is being called \"New Materialism\"
is about putting forward a theory of \"reality\" in which the
exploitation of labor is rendered secondary to a diverse \"network\" of
exchanges, and th[e relations between capital and labor, production and
consumption, ideology and science,... are rendered fuzzy and
indistinguishable]{.underline}. It is on the basis of an \"openness\"
that Edwards advises we need to accept that society cannot be studied as
a \"metatheory of the successive development of modes of
production...but an open totality\" (291) which resists any \"closure.\"
\"Fixed\" or \"closed\" here means the primacy of the economic and the
very possibility of theorizing the social totality of capitalism as an
expression of its underlying logic in favor of an \"aleatory totality\"
that never draws conclusions or, in fact, challenges capitalism\'s basis
in exploitation. Society, he declares, operates as a network of
\"relatively autonomous\" \"levels,\" \"moments\" and \"practices\"
which are and occupy \"distinct spaces as well as times\" (286). In
other words, culture is distinct from production, which is distinct from
politics, which has little connection to the day-to-day lives of
individuals. Just as the internet appears to writers such as Clay Shirky
(Here Comes Everybody) and Yochai Benkler (The Wealth of Networks) to
operate spontaneously and \"organically,\" connecting multiple sites in
multiple ways in contrast to any seemingly overarching logic, in
Edwards\' argument there is no way of drawing conclusions about the
connections which connect political, environmental or economic
contradictions to the exploitative logic of capitalism. As such, there
is never a question about the material implications of exploitation as
it becomes just one of a multitude of social forces without any
overarching logic of determinacy.

#### Capitalism results in a death drive that makes structural violence and sacrificial genocide

**Santos 3** (Boaventura de Sousa, director of the Center for Social
Studies at the University of Coimbra, EUROZINE, COLLECTIVE SUICIDE OR
GLOBALIZATION FROM BELOW,
<http://www.eurozine.com/article/2003-03-26-santos-en.html>) \*Note this

According to Franz Hinkelammert, [the West has repeatedly been under the
illusion that it should try to save humanity by destroying part of it.
This is a salvific and sacrificial destruction, committed in the name of
the need to radically materialize all the possibilities opened up by a
given social and political reality over which it is supposed to have
total power. *This is how it was in colonialism, with the genocide of
indigenous peoples, and the African slaves. This is how it was in the
period of imperialist struggles, which caused millions of deaths in two
world wars and many other colonial wars.*]{.underline} This is how it
was in Stalinism, with the Gulag and in Nazism, with the holocaust. And
now today, [this is how it is in neoliberalism, with the collective
sacrifice of the periphery and even the semiperiphery of the world
system.]{.underline} With the war against Iraq, it is fitting to ask
whether what is in progress is a new genocidal and sacrificial illusion,
and what its scope might be. [It is above all appropriate to ask if the
new illusion will not herald the radicalization and the ultimate
perversion of the western illusion: destroying all of humanity in the
illusion of saving it.]{.underline} [Sacrificial genocide arises from
a\[n\] totalitarian illusion that is manifested in the belief that there
are no alternatives to the present-day reality and that the problems and
difficulties confronting it arise from failing to take its logic of
development to its ultimate consequences. If there is
unemployment]{.underline}, hunger and death in the Third World, [this is
not the result of market failures; instead, it is the outcome of the
market laws not having been fully applied. If there is terrorism, this
is not due to the violence of the conditions that generate it; it is
due, rather, to the fact that total violence has not been employed to
physically eradicate all terrorists and potential terrorists. This
political logic is based on the supposition of total power and
knowledge, and on the radical rejection of alternatives; it is
ultra-conservative in that it aims to infinitely reproduce the status
quo.]{.underline} [Inherent to it is the notion of the end of history.
During the last hundred years, the West has experienced three versions
of this logic, and, therefore, seen three versions of the end of
history: Stalinism, with its logic of insuperable efficiency of the
plan; Nazism, with its logic of racial superiority; and neoliberalism,
with its logic of insuperable efficiency of the market]{.underline}. The
first two periods involved the destruction of democracy. The last one
trivializes democracy, disarming it in the face of social actors
sufficiently powerful to be able to privatize the State and
international institutions in their favour. I have described this
situation as a combination of political democracy and social fascism.
One current manifestation of this combination resides in the fact that
intensely strong public opinion, worldwide, against the war is found to
be incapable of halting the war machine set in motion by supposedly
democratic rulers. [At all these moments, a death drive, a catastrophic
heroism, predominates, the idea of a looming collective
\[destruction\]\*, only preventable by the massive destruction of the
other. Paradoxically, the broader the definition of the other and the
efficacy of its destruction, the more likely collective
\[destruction\]\* becomes. In its sacrificial genocide version,
neoliberalism is a mixture of market radicalization, neoconservatism and
Christian fundamentalism. Its death drive takes a number of forms, from
the idea of \"discardable populations]{.underline}\", referring to
citizens of the Third World not capable of being exploited as workers
and consumers, [to the concept of \"collateral damage]{.underline}\", to
refer to the deaths, as a result of war, of thousands of innocent
civilians. The last, catastrophic heroism, is quite clear on two facts:
according to reliable calculations by the Non-Governmental Organization
MEDACT, in London, between 48 and 260 thousand civilians will die during
the war against Iraq and in the three months after (this is without
there being civil war or a nuclear attack); the war will cost 100
billion dollars, - and much more if the costs of reconstruction are
added - enough to pay the health costs of the world\'s poorest countries
for four years.

#### Militarism continues the cycle of capitalism

**Seymour** Richard, political activist, 3/7/20**14,** "[Global military
spending is now an integral part of
capitalism](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/07/global-military-spending-integral-capitalism-peace-dividend)",
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/07/global-military-spending-integral-capitalism-peace-dividend>

China\'s [surge in military
spending](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/china-defend-itself-military-spending-budget-sovereignty-us)
gains
[headlines](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10677079/China-announces-surge-in-military-spending.html),
partly because of the ominous implications regarding its regional
contest with Japan, but it\'s the deeper structures of military spending
in general that are far more compelling. There are few surprises about
the [distribution of military
spending](http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending):
for all the current focus on China\'s growing military outlays -- and it
is significant that they have embarked on a sequence of double-digit
increases as a percentage of GDP -- the United States still accounts for
40% of such expenditures. However, the distribution is not the only
thing that matters; it\'s the sheer scale of such investment --
\$1.756tn in 2012. The \"[peace
dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_dividend)\" from the end
of the cold war has long since bitten the dust. Global military spending
has returned to pre-1989 levels, undoubtedly a legacy of the war on
terror and the returning salience of military competition in its
context. In fact, by 2011 global military spending was higher than at
any year since the end of the second world war. So, what is the
explanation for such huge investments? Is it simply the case that states
are power-maximising entities, and that as soon as they have access to
enough taxable income they start dreaming war? In a very general sense,
[militarisation could be seen as an integral aspect of
capitalism]{.mark}. One of the central ambiguities of [capitalism
is]{.mark} that it is necessarily [a global system]{.mark}, with
production and exchange extending beyond national boundaries; yet at the
same time, units of capital (corporations etc) tend to be concentrated
within national states where they are afforded an infrastructure, a
labour force, and a great deal of primary investments. Even the [process
of globalisation presupposes the investment and guidance of national
states]{.mark}. The more deeply companies are intertwined with national
states, the more they rely on those states to fight their competitive
battles on a global stage. [Maintaining a military advantage is arguably
an intrinsic part]{.mark} of this. However, once this rather abstract
principle is established, the question still remains unanswered. After
all, there is no inherent reason why geo-economic competition should
lead to defence spending consuming trillions of dollars of value each
year. Part of the answer has to be located in the way that high levels
of military spending became such an entrenched part of the global
landscape in the aftermath of two world wars. In the context of the
second world war, and then in the subsequent cold war, one thing about
military spending that became abundantly clear is that it is never just
about conflict[. As in the conduct of wars themselves, the
institutionalisation of military spending quickly becomes entangled in a
series of incentives that are entirely tangential to the ostensive
motive.]{.mark} First of all, states that do embark on large scale
military investment quickly assume strategic command of core sectors of
the economy, allowing for a degree of planning and co-ordination, a
level of state capacity that might otherwise be deplored by business as
\"socialism\". Quite a lot of the [major US tec]{.mark}hnological
[advances made under]{.mark} the rubric of [\"free enterprise\",]{.mark}
including particularly [Apple\'s
innovations](http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/programs/economic-growth/where-the-iphone-came-from),
[owe themselves originally to state investments organised under the
banner of \"defence\"]{.mark}. Second, [military investment is not just
an effect of economic growth, but]{.mark} often [a lever in enhancing
it]{.mark}. This is a complicated story in itself. Post-war US growth
was probably enhanced by arms spending, but the levels of spending
required during the Vietnam war sapped too much capital away from other
profitable investments. By the same token, it is not clear whether
Japan\'s rise to becoming a major global economic power would have been
possible had its military commitments not been constitutionally limited.
Nonetheless, there is some complex evidence of arms spending increasing
growth. Barry Rundquist and Thomas Carsey\'s [study of military
procurement in the United
States](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YPoAhpuXHZUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)
demonstrates that this has a distributive aspect. Such spending in the
US helps already wealthy, booming locales become even wealthier, but it
does not tend to make poor areas wealthier and nor does it reduce
unemployment. This is quite significant, because one of the major
arguments governments offer for protecting military spending is that it
protects jobs -- the one situation in which governments almost always
feign an interest in employment. There is actually little evidence for
this claim. That brings us to a final point. There is no way to discuss
the real dimensions of military competition without looking at how this
is represented for particular audiences. One thinks of the way in which
struggles over arms spending in the US become inflected with evocations
of external threats, which help consolidate domestic power blocs. The
Reaganite-era neo-conservative bloc was impossible without an elevated
Russian \"threat\". So, particularly in states with an imperialist role,
military spending can become complexly bound up not only with
state-building strategies and agendas for regional economic growth, but
also with domestic hegemonic strategies in which the legitimacy of
governments hinges upon their ability to project violence. To this
extent, to really understand world arms spending it is necessary to
penetrate beneath the generalities about sui generis state behaviour, as
power-maximisers and so on, and delve into the messy politics of
militarism in each society.
