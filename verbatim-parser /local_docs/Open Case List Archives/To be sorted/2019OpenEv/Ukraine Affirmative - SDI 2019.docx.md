# Ukraine Arms Sales Affirmative

### 1AC

#### Observation One is Inherency:

#### The U.S. is substantially increasing foreign military sales to Ukraine, including armed Coast Guard cutters.

Military Sales Program;" Sputnik, July 9, 2019;

[[The US is set **to supply Kiev with new weapons, including two coast
guard cutters**, in a bid to **bolster the country's
military**]{.mark}**,** a US diplomat in Ukraine announced]{.underline}
Sunday. "[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[is]{.mark} pleased to be able [to provide additional
equipment,"]{.mark} William B. Taylor, the chargé d'affaires at the
United States embassy in Kiev, said]{.underline} in Sunday remarks at
the Sea Breeze military exercises in Odessa. "In particular, [[two
Island Class boats from the United States will join the Ukrainian Navy's
fleet]{.mark}]{.underline} within a couple of months." "And I'm very
pleased to announce today that [[Ukraine has
requested]{.underline}]{.mark} for the first time [the [purchase of
military equipment through]{.mark}]{.underline} a special US Defense
Department program, called [[the **Foreign Military Sales
program**]{.mark}."]{.underline} The island-class patrol boats are
110-foot, 168-ton cutters used by the US Coast Guard to patrol US
littoral regions. They sport .50-caliber machine guns and 25-millimeter
"bushmaster" deck guns. It's unclear what other weaponry might be
supplied to Kiev, but [[in the last year, the Pentagon has moved to
supply the former Soviet republic with \$307 million in Javelin
anti-tank missiles and another \$200 million in security cooperation
funds.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Trump administration's decision reversed
a policy put in place by Barack Obama, who was the US president when the
pro-Western Maidan government seized power in a February 2014 coup
d'etat, precipitating the rebellion of autonomous cities in the majority
Russian-speaking cities in eastern Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula,
the latter of which formally rejoined Russia later that year following a
plebiscite.

#### Plan Text:

#### The United States federal government should substantially reduce its Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of lethal weapons from the United States to Ukraine.

#### Advantage \_\_\_\_\_is Ukraine War Escalation, Terminating in U.S.-Russia Global Nuclear Conflagration.

#### Scenario One is Ukraine War Escalation:

#### Lethal U.S. arms sales to Ukraine will keep alive and likely escalate the war with Russian supported separatists. Tens of thousands will die.

[[**Selling lethal weapons** to Ukraine is the equivalent of **pouring
kerosene onto a flame**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [ongoing hostilities
between Ukraine and Russia]{.underline} \-- including the Kerch strait
crisis, which began late last year when Russia intercepted three
Ukrainian vessels and took 24 crew members captive \-- [are]{.underline}
[also a major business opportunity for]{.underline} the world\'s largest
[defense contractors. [Despite the **risk of serious
escalation**]{.mark}, these [companies continue to provide Ukraine with
lethal aid so it can defend itself against Russia \-- for a
price]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course. The U.S. special representative
for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, stated recently that [[Washington
remains committed to providing support to Ukraine and its military,
including anti-tank systems]{.mark}.]{.underline} He even hinted that
[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is
considering **expanding** the types of **lethal aid**]{.mark} that it
could begin [selling to Ukraine]{.mark},]{.underline} saying: \"We also
need to be [[looking at]{.underline}]{.mark} things like
[[air]{.underline}]{.mark} defense [[and coastal defense.]{.mark}\" This
is [a troubling prospect]{.mark}]{.underline}. In March, U.S. Army Gen.
Curtis Scaparrotti said that the United States could also bolster the
Ukrainian military\'s sniper capabilities. Speaking to the Senate Armed
Services Committee, he said: \"[[There are other]{.underline}]{.mark}
systems, [[sniper systems, ammunition and]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps
looking at the Kerch Strait, perhaps consideration for [[naval
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well, here [i[n]{.mark} [the
future]{.mark}]{.underline} [as]{.mark} we move forward.\" This comment
has been widely underreported and has not received nearly as much
attention as it deserves [[considering]{.mark} the [potential
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. At worst, **[[more lethal aid could
escalate the conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** further[. [At best, it will
**continue to keep alive a conflict that has killed more than
10,000**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finding a straightforward policy
alternative is difficult, but **[[sending more lethal aid to achieve the
unattainable goal of Ukraine defeating Russia is certainly no
solution.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### U.S. arms sales to Ukraine won't change the military balance while leading to its complicity in escalating the bloodshed.

[[Arming Ukraine makes little]{.mark} strategic [sense. A couple hundred
antitank **missiles will not alter the military balance** between
Ukraine and Russia in Donbas]{.mark} in any meaningful way. [**Russia
can quickly move additional forces and equipment** to the region]{.mark}
at will]{.underline}. [[The bigger danger is]{.mark} that [arming
Ukraine will]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in fact [[prompt Russia to
do]{.mark}]{.underline} just [[that]{.underline},]{.mark} thereby
**[[risking]{.underline}]{.mark}** an [[**intensification of the
conflict** and]{.mark} potentially leading to **[more casualties than
the 10,000 already suffered]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is clear, in
fact, that [this is exactly how Russia sees things]{.underline}. In
December after the State Department approved the sale, [Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesperson]{.underline} Maria [Zakharova said]{.underline},
"[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.mark}t]{.underline}ates
[i[s]{.mark},]{.underline} in fact,
[**[encouraging]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[**resumption of large-scale
bloodshed** in Donbass, where the situation is **already on the edge**
due to continuing shelling]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Kiev-controlled
side...[[Washington]{.underline},]{.mark} in fact, [[becomes an
**accomplice** in]{.mark} the [**killing** of
people."]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Scenario Two is U.S. Russia Nuclear Conflict:

#### Increased U.S. arms sales to Ukraine risks a full- blown confrontation with Russia. U.S. should refuse to approve arms sales.

policy studies at the Cato Institute; "Washington Quietly Increases

Both [the [**danger of stoking tensions** with
Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline} and becoming too close to a regime in Kiev
that exhibits disturbing features [[should caution]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [**against boosting military aid** to
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is an unwise policy on strategic as
well as moral grounds. Trump administration officials should refuse to
be intimidated or stampeded into forging a risky and unsavory alliance
with Kiev out of fear of being portrayed as excessively "soft" toward
Russia. Instead, [[the president and]{.mark} his [advisers need to
**spurn efforts to increase U.S. support for
Ukraine.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[A good place to start would be to
**restore the Obama administration's refusal to approve arms sales** to
Kiev. **Washington must not pour gasoline on a geo-strategic fire that
could lead to a full-blown crisis** between the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### U.S. arms transfers to Ukraine will precipitate nuclear war with Russia following escalation in the Donbass. Russia will first strike the U.S., destroying the planet.

III Against Russia;" Strategic Culture Foundation; October 2, 2018;
https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2018/10/02/us-switching-ukraine-location-start-world-war-iii-against-russia/\]

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates Government [is now treating Ukraine
as]{.mark} if it were [a NATO member, and]{.mark}]{.underline} on
September 27th **[[donated to Ukraine two warships for use against
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is the latest indication that [[the
US is switching to **Ukraine as the locale** to start **World War III,**
and from which the **nuclear war is to be sparked against
Russia**]{.mark},]{.underline} which borders Ukraine. Here is why Syria
is no longer the US alliance's preferred choice as a place to start WW
III: On September 4th, US President Donald Trump publicly threatened
Syria, Iran and Russia that if they exterminated the jihadists in
Syria's only remaining jihadist-controlled province, Idlib, then the US
might launch a full-scale invasion against Syria, Iran and Russia in
Syria. Either the US or Russia would then quickly escalate to nuclear
war so as not to lose in Syria --- that would be the conventional-war
start to World War III. The leaders of Russia, Iran, Turkey, and Syria
(Putin, Rouhani, Erdogan, and Assad), agreed in two meetings, one on
September 7th and the other on September 17th, to (as I had recommended
on September 10th) transfer control of Syria's only remaining
jihadist-controlled province, Idlib, to NATO-member Turkey. This action
effectively prevents the US alliance from going to war against Russia if
Russia's alliance (which includes Syria) obliterates all the jihadist
groups in the Al-Qaeda-led Syrian province Idlib. For the US to war
against Russia there would also be war against fellow-NATO-member Turkey
--- out of the question. The US has been using Al Qaeda in Syria to
train and lead the jihadist groups which have been trying to overthrow
Syria's Government and to replace it with a government that has been
selected by the Saud family who own Saudi Arabia. Ever since 1949 the US
Government has been trying to do this (to place the Saud family in
charge of Syria). That plan is now being placed on-hold if not blocked
altogether, because of the Russia, Turkey, Iran, Syria, agreement. As I
reported on September 25th, "Turkey Now Controls Syria's Jihadists". The
US would no longer be able to save them, but Turkey would, if Erdogan
wants to. "Turkey is thus now balanced on a knife's edge, between the US
and its allies (representing the Saud family) on the one side, versus
Russia and its allies (representing the anti-Saud alliance) on the
other." During the same period in which the US Government was setting
Syria up as the place to start WW III, it was also setting up Ukraine as
an alternative possibility to do that. US President Obama, in a very
bloody February 2014 coup which he had started planning by no later than
2011, overthrew Ukraine's democratically elected President, and replaced
him by a rabidly anti-Russian racist-fascist regime whose Ukrainian
tradition went back to ideologically nazi Ukrainian organizations that
had supported Hitler during World War II. Though communism is gone from
Russia ever since 1991, the US aristocracy never ended its goal of
conquering Russia; the Cold War was secretly continued on the US-NATO
side. Ukraine's nazis (meaning its racist-fascists) are now the US and
UK aristocracies' chief hope to achieve this ambition of a US-and-allied
global conquest. Here are the recent steps toward WW III regarding the
US alliance's new (since 2014) prize, Ukraine: On September 28th, John
Siciliano at the Washington Examiner bannered "Ryan Zinke: Naval
blockade is an option for dealing with Russia" and he reported that
Trump's Interior Secretary Zinke had said "There is the military option,
which I would rather not. And there is the economic option. ... The
economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and
replacing fuels." He was saying that in order for the US to get its and
its allies' (mainly the Sauds') oil and gas into Europe replacing some
of Russia's dominant market-share in that --- the world's largest
energy-consuming --- market (and also shrink Iran's market-share there),
a military blockade against Russia and Iran would be an option.
Currently, most of Russia's oil and gas into Europe goes via pipelines
through Ukraine, which the US already controls. Siciliano's news-break
received a follow-up on September 30th from Zero Hedge. On October 1st,
George Eliason, the great investigative journalist who happens to live
in Donbass, the southeastern part of Ukraine that broke off from Ukraine
when Obama's coup overthrew the democratically elected Ukrainian
President who had received over 90% of the votes in Donbass, reported at
The Saker's site, that [[Ukraine's war against Donbass was now returning
in full force.]{.mark}]{.underline} Headlining "War Crimes in LNR and
DNR \[Donbass\] ---The Unannounced War", he opened: On September 28th,
Lugansk Peoples Republic (LNR)Deputy Foreign Minister Anna Soroka and
Andrey Chernov gave a presentation unveiling a photo album entitled
Unannounced war. This collection of 150 images details the war crimes by
the Ukrainian government during the war from 2014-2018. Over the last 4
years, many journalists including myself reported on the war crimes
committed by Ukrainian punisher battalions and sometimes the Ukrainian
army. These war crimes are privately funded by Ukrainian Diaspora groups
led primarily by US and Canadian citizens. The Ukrainian punisher
battalions and Ukrainian volunteer battalions take pride in the fact
there is no need to hide any of Ukraine's crimes from the West's prying
eyes. Even now, when there is supposed to be a ceasefire so the children
can go to school, Kiev is shelling cities and towns across Donbass. On
September 29th, in just 24 hours Ukrainian army units shelled DNR
(Donetsk Peoples Republic) over 300 times violating the ceasefire. The
US Government is trying to bully Russia and its allies, and now is
overtly threatening to go to a naval blockade against Russia. Those two
warships that the US just donated to Ukraine could be helpful in such a
blockade. Alternatively, [[Ukraine's re-invasion of Donbass might become
**Trump's opportunity to 'aid a NATO ally'** and **precipitate WW III
from a conventional war** in Donbass]{.underline}. [Either way would
likely **produce from Russia a nuclear blitz-attack to eliminate as many
of America's retaliatory weapons as possible**]{.underline}]{.mark}, so
as to beat the US to the punch. In military terms, the side that suffers
the less damage 'wins', even if it's [[a]{.underline} [nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[destroys the
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The side that would strike first in a
nuclear war would almost certainly suffer the less damage, because most
of the opponent's retaliatory weaponry would be destroyed in that
attack. Trump is playing nuclear "chicken" against Putin. He is sorely
trying Putin's patience. If the US regime uses any of these entry-points
to a conventional war, Russia would simply be waiting for the US to
nuclear blitz-attack Russia, which the US regime has long been intending
to do. Regardless which side goes nuclear first, [[the blockade and/or
re-invasion of Donbass]{.underline}]{.mark} (repeating there such things
as this and this) [[will have started **WWIII.**]{.underline}]{.mark}
And, clearly, any survivors would likely view the US in the way that
most of today's world views the fascist powers in WWII: as having been
the aggressors. Consequently, if the American people cannot first
overthrow the US regime and establish an authentic democracy here, then
**[[WWIII seems likely to result]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which would be
[[an **outcome far worse, for the entire
world**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} than an overthrow of the government
that the entire world considers to be by far the most dangerous on
Earth.

#### Advantage \_\_\_\_\_is Human Rights.

#### Human rights are currently under widespread assault in Ukraine: attacks on LGBT rights and media freedom, age discrimination, lack of transparency and accountability.

Moreover, [[although Kiev's cheerleaders in the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}ern ([[especially U.S.]{.mark})]{.underline}
media [[like to portray Ukraine as a beleaguered
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} that plays the role of David to Russia's
evil Goliath, the [[reality is **far murkier**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
Putin's government overstates matters when it alleges that Ukraine's
2014 Maidan revolution was a U.S.-orchestrated coup that brought
outright fascists to power in Kiev. Nevertheless, that version contains
more than a little truth. [[Prominent, powerful U.S.
figures]{.underline}]{.mark}, most notably the late Senator John McCain
and Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs
Victoria Nuland, [[openly sided with demonstrators seeking to **unseat
Ukraine's elected government**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, Nuland was
caught on tape with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt scheming
about the desired composition of a new government in Kiev. It is unfair
to portray Ukraine's current administration led by President Petro
Poroshenko as a neo-fascist regime. Post-revolution elections appear to
have been reasonably free and fair, and there are major factions that
are committed to genuine democratic values. But [[Ukraine]{.mark} also
[is **hardly a model of Western-style democracy.** Not only is it
**afflicted with extensive graft and corruption**, but]{.mark} some
[extreme]{.mark} [nationalist and]{.mark} even [**neo-Nazi** groups play
a significant role in the "new" Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The
**notoriously fascist** Azov Battalion,]{.underline}]{.mark} for
example, [[continues to occupy a prominent position in Kiev's efforts to
defeat separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbass
region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Alexander [[Zakharchenko, prime minister of
the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
pro-Russia rebel-occupied city of Donetsk, [[was
**assassinated**]{.mark}]{.underline} on September 1 and officials there
and in Russia are blaming Kiev. The Ukrainian government has denied
involvement. Other [[ultranationalist factions act as domestic militias
that attempt to **intimidate more moderate
Ukrainians**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Even [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Our common humanity creates a moral obligation to recognize and at least try to remedy human rights violations.

**Levine, '18** \[Iain, deputy executive director of Human Rights Watch;
"Why Human Rights Matter;" Atlantic Council, December 10, 2018;
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-human-rights-matter\]

In short, [[our commitment to human rights values
comes]{.underline}]{.mark} not from the articles and laws that codify
them ---important as they are---but [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
something much more fundamental[[**:** a deep and ineffable recognition
of **common humanity** creating a commitment to work with and identify
with those who are so often "**the other**"---the most
hated]{.underline},]{.mark} the most
[[dispossessed,]{.underline}]{.mark} the most [[discriminated
against]{.underline}]{.mark} people [[in the world]{.underline}]{.mark}:
the Rohingya in Myanmar, LGBT people in Chechnya, women in Saudi Arabia,
undocumented migrants in the United States, a malnourished child in
South Sudan, an activist living under the government's iron fist in
Venezuela. James Baldwin wrote that "Not everything that is faced can be
changed. But nothing can be changed until it is faced." Human rights
activists around the world work every day---often at great risk to their
own lives---to face evil in order to change it. At its best, [[human
rights activism fulfills]{.underline}]{.mark} the values enshrined in
the Universal Declaration [in [a celebration of **common
humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[even when it fails to remedy that
injustice, human rights activism seeks to fulfill the **moral imperative
of bearing witness**,]{.mark} of **[demonstrating solidarity with
victims of human rights violations, and]{.mark}---**]{.underline}through
that solidarity[**---**[affirming]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**universal
values** of human rights]{.underline}]{.mark} as enshrined in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The damage being done to people's
human rights by many abusive leaders around the world will not be easily
undone. And [[while it is not given to us to solve all of the injustices
of the world, **neither are we ever absolved from the obligation to
try.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Observation 2 is Solvency:

#### Banning lethal weapons sales to Ukraine will deescalate the conflict and ultimately lead to diplomatic and democratic solutions.

\-- but it [[is **more likely to succeed than**]{.mark} simply
**[supplying more weapons]{.mark}** with which [to prolong]{.mark} the
[fighting.]{.mark}]{.underline} The West should not abandon its rhetoric
of support for Ukraine\'s territorial integrity. But
[[policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and society more broadly [[should be
careful not to assume that simply selling more weapons to Ukraine will
yield a definitive victory over Russia]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
its [[separatist allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the ongoing war in
the the eastern Donbas region and the recent Kerch incident offer an
opportunity for big businesses to make a profit, it\'s [[ordinary
people]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[will pay the price. The current
approach to **de-escalating the conflict needs to be dramatically
re-evaluated** \-- and **lethal weapons must be taken off the

[[THE TRUMP administration will deploy **\$250 million** worth of
military aid and equipment -- some]{.underline}]{.mark} of it
[**[lethal]{.mark}** -- [to Ukraine\'s armed forces]{.mark}]{.underline}
as it seeks to deter Russian aggression [[amid a recent spike in hostile
acts]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Defense Department confirmed Tuesday.
[[The **new equipment**]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. will provide
[[includes **sniper rifles** for Ukraine\'s special operations forces,
as well as **grenade launchers**, **counter-artillery radars** and
equipment to detect and protect against electronic
warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Obama administration and initially
President Donald Trump balked at sending lethal weapons to Ukraine
reportedly for fear of provoking Moscow, despite pressure from Congress.
[[Trump authorized sending Javelin anti-tank missiles in
2017]{.underline}. [The U.S. will also increase its support to the

[[Washington is **upping the ante in Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Kurt [[Volker, US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations,
said]{.underline}]{.mark} in an interview with the Guardian published on
September 1 that "[[Washington is ready to **expand arms supplies** to
Ukraine]{.mark} in order [to build up the country's naval and air
defense forces]{.mark} in the face of continuing Russian support for
eastern separatists.]{.underline}" According to him, [[the Trump
administration was "**absolutely" prepared to go further in supplying
lethal weaponry** to Ukrainian forces than]{.mark} the [anti-tank
missiles it delivered]{.mark}]{.underline} in April. "[[They need lethal
assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}," he emphasized. Mr. Volker explained
that "\[t\]hey need to rebuild a navy and they have very limited air
capability as well. I think [[we'll have to look at air
defense."]{.underline} [The diplomat believes Ukraine needs unmanned
aerial vehicles, counter-battery radar systems, and anti-sniper
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}[. [The issue of **lethal arms purchases has
been discussed at the highest level.** The National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 allocated **\$250m** in military
assistance to Ukraine, including lethal arms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
US has delivered Javelin anti-tank missile systems to Kiev]{.underline}
but this time [[the ambassador talked about an **incomparably larger
deal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Former President Barack [[Obama had been
unconvinced that granting Ukraine lethal defensive weapons would
be]{.mark} the [righ]{.mark}t decision]{.underline}, in view of the
widespread corruption there. [[This **policy has changed
under**]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[**Trump,**
who]{.underline}]{.mark} --- among other things --- [[approved
deliveries of anti-tank missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} to Kiev last
December.

**U.S. arms sales to Ukraine are substantially escalating now**.

[[Washington's security ties to Kiev were already **growing to an

this]{.underline} on November 18 [after he]{.underline} [met with U.S.

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration on Tuesday [announced
[plans to provide an **additional \$250 million in lethal
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline} and aid [[to the **Ukrainian

military will have given a total of \$1.5 billion to Ukraine since
2014[,]{.mark} when Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula. The funds will
"support ongoing training programs and operational needs" and finance
additional training and equipment for Ukrainian forces, the Pentagon
said in a statement. [[Some of the equipment provided will be
particularly useful for]{.underline}]{.mark} protecting against and
[[**confronting Russia, including sniper rifles, grenade launchers,
counter-artillery radars, electronic warfare-detection technology**, and

Providing lethal military equipment to Ukraine, as aid or as sales, has
led to debate in various European countries and, in particular, the USA.
In 2014 some members of the US Congress, mainly from the Republican
party, and some high-level officials of the Department of Defense (DOD)
and the Department of State suggested or demanded that the US
administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, should give lethal
aid. The Congress even passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act in
December 2014 to allow the administration to provide military equipment
and aid to Ukraine.61 However, Obama refused to offer more than limited
aid in the form of training and non-lethal equipment.62 During his
presidential election campaign in 2016, Donald J. Trump, a Republican,
made a minor point of criticizing Obama for not doing more for Ukraine
but he himself did not join other Republicans who wanted to give Ukraine
lethal aid.63 By mid-2016 only some limited sales of small arms had been
allowed.64 After Trump took office as president in January 2017, it took
the new administration until December 2017 to follow the line of the
Congress. The 2018 defence budget proposal by President Trump included
aid of \$350 million for Ukraine and authorized the supply of lethal
weapons, but the final agreed budget reduced the funding for 2018 to
\$200 million.65 [[The US Government]{.mark} then [announced that it
would allow the first large supply of US lethal equipment to Ukraine: it
approved]{.mark}]{.underline} in principle possible
[[sales]{.mark},]{.underline} not aid[, [of long-range sniper rifles,
shotguns and related equipment worth \$41.5 million, and 35 Javelin
anti-tank missile launchers with 220 missiles worth \$48
million.]{.underline}]{.mark} 66 [[The Javelin plan
was]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[formally approved]{.underline}]{.mark}
on 1 May 2018, [[adjusted to 210 missiles from US military stocks and 37
launchers]{.underline}]{.mark}.67 Ukraine had asked for 1200 missiles.68
[[The supplied missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} will not have a major
impact on Ukraine's fighting capabilities but are largely a political
symbol and [[may open the way for more US sales]{.underline}]{.mark}.
According to the US DOD, [[further sales to Ukraine are likely and
future decisions on such sales will]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[be
made faster]{.underline}]{.mark}.69 Russia's view on the proposed aid
and sales was of course negative; it stated that it changed the US role
in the conflict from possible 'mediator' to one of 'accomplice'.70

### EXT: Ukraine War Escalation Scenario

#### Increased U.S. sales of lethal weapons to Ukraine would provoke Russian escalation of the conflict.

**Korzun, '18** \[Peter, expert on wars and conflicts at the Strategic
Culture Foundation; "United States to Drastically Expand Military
Assistance to Ukraine;" Mint Press News, September 4, 2018;
https://www.mintpressnews.com/us-military-assistance-ukraine/248675/\]

[[The move is **provocative** and]{.underline}]{.mark} it may have
consequences. For instance, [[Russia could supply the self-proclaimed
republics in eastern Ukraine with up-to-date weapons systems in
quantities sufficient to deter any military action on the part of Kiev.
Once the Minsk accords are no longer functional and cannot command
obediance, Moscow could recognize those republics as independent
states]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[eligible for military cooperation
agreements, which would include stationing military bases on their soil.
If their governments invited the Russian armed forces to be deployed
inside their borders, it would be quite natural to
agree]{.underline}]{.mark} to []{.mark}those requests. []{.mark}No
international law would be breached. In a nutshell, [[**if the US
crosses that red line, Russia will act accordingly. Nobody seems to want
a war raging in Ukraine, but that's what the US weapons supplies would
promote, egging the Ukrainian government on to seek a military
solution**.]{.underline}]{.mark} And what if it loses? [[**Washington
would be to blame** for such a scenario]{.underline}.]{.mark} By the
way, is it a coincidence that Mr. Volker's interview appeared just as
Alexander Zakharchenko, the leader of the Donetsk self-proclaimed
republic, was assassinated? Just asking.

#### U.S. arms sales to Ukraine would kill hope of better relations with Russia and invite out of control Russian military escalation.

President Donald Trump's top advisers are closer now to achieving what
seemed unthinkable at the start of his presidency: [[Shipping millions
of dollars of US weapons to Ukraine's embattled
military]{.underline}.]{.mark} The president, whose former campaign
associates nixed language supporting arms to Ukraine in the GOP's party
platform in 2016, was never going to be an easy sell on the issue.
Approving the measure [[would likely **enrage Moscow** and
**jeopardize** Trump\'s hopes of cultivating **better ties** with the
Cold War adversary. Key US allies]{.underline}]{.mark} including Germany
[[oppose the decision out of concern that it could **trigger Russia to
step up its military intervention** in Ukraine in ways that **spiral out
of control**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### U.S. arms sales will cause a rapidly escalating cycle of violence in Ukraine. U.S. and Russia will match each other's actions.

[The [conflict in Eastern Ukraine has claimed over **10,000 lives** and
forced over a **million**]{.mark} more [to flee]{.mark}]{.underline}
their homes.\[4\] Taking these figures into consideration, it is evident
that decisive action is necessary; thus far, however, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has taken
the wrong approach. Arming Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles runs
the risk of **reigniting** what has become a **relatively static
engagement** between the Ukrainian Army and Russian-backed
separatists]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[5\] Skirmishes occur on a daily
basis, and casualties continue to accrue, but [a [**sudden injection**
of Western munitions into the hands of the Ukrainian Army is likely to
prompt a **disproportionate response** from]{.mark}]{.underline} the
side of [[the Russians, a reaction not without historical
precedence]{.underline}.]{.mark}\[6\] [[Assuming the Russians
respond]{.mark} not in kind]{.underline}, but with asymmetric force,
[[where does that leave the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates? Is the United States [[to perpetually
provide bigger and better arms]{.underline}]{.mark} as the process
persists [[in some sort of **vicious**]{.mark}]{.underline} iteration of
Robert Jervis's **[[spiral]{.mark}]{.underline}** model?\[7\] For now,
[[Russia has **far more at stake**]{.mark} in this
conflict.]{.underline} With his population's support and at least six
more years at the helm, Vladimir [[Putin can and will broaden his
country's efforts in the region]{.underline}]{.mark} if need be.\[8\]
[[Even if the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[were [committed to meet every response with more firepower, the
Russians have the **overwhelming advantage of geography.**
Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} shared [[border with
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that is reportedly [[**near-impossible
to effectively monitor**, enables **expedited
resupplies**.]{.underline}\[]{.mark}9\] [[**Putin's relative autonomy**
in terms of foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark} decisions also [[adds to
the potential for a **rapid response**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### U.S. lethal weapons sales will green light Ukraine to escalate the conflict.

Furthermore, it is prudent to [[consider how Ukrainians may interpret
the **signaling of receiving lethal arms** from America. Inspired
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**renewed and augmented support** of the
Americans, this move **could embolden Ukrainians to begin launching
assaults**,]{.mark} thus [producing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[an
**avoidable escalation scenario**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Many]{.mark}]{.underline} like to [[frame the conversation as
providing so-**called defensive weapons rather than offensive,
but**]{.mark} **in reality, [there is no logical distinction]{.mark}
between the two.\[10\] The [Ukrainians using these weapons to go on an
offensive]{.mark}**[, making the **U.S. an indirect accomplice in
violating the Minsk Agreement**, remains a real
possibility]{.mark}]{.underline} and a real concern of those monitoring
the situation closely.\[11\]

#### Selling arms to Ukraine will escalate U.S.-Russian tensions while increasing Russian intervention in Ukraine.

https://reason.com/2017/10/26/trump-admin-on-verge-of-sending-arms-to/\]

[[**Sending arms to Ukraine** would be a **terrible idea**. It **would
needlessly escalate tensions** between Russia and the West **while
inviting Moscow to ramp up their own intervention**]{.underline}]{.mark}
in Ukraine. The idea is one that the U.S. has avoided since the conflict
began in 2014[[.]{.underline}]{.mark} Former Obama officials say they
wanted to send lethal aid to Ukraine but were thwarted by Barack Obama
and his national security advisor, Susan Rice. Abstaining from sending
arms then \"became the de facto policy, and then the urgency slipped
away,\" Max Bergmann, an Obama-era State Department official, told
Foreign Policy.

#### Lethal arms sales to Ukraine would be counterproductive. Russian and separatist reaction will exacerbate the conflict.

https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/what-does-america-gain-by-arming-ukraine-24901\]

[[Not only will the sale of lethal arms **not materially help Ukraine**,
but]{.underline}]{.mark} also it [[will **likely increase Russian and
separatist opposition, worsening the
situation**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} A change in the methodology of how
the government engages internationally is needed. Whether in Ukraine or
another international engagement, if an honest analysis reveals that the
United States has merely a secondary or tertiary interest---rather than
a core national interest---yet commits itself to expending valuable
political or military capital, the chances are high that such engagement
would end up costing more than would be gained. Why should Washington
spend money and risk the lives of our troops for a mission that would
leave the country at a net loss? In the current standoff in the Ukraine,
[[Washington would certainly prefer to see a peaceful resolution to the
violence. For Moscow and Kiev]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [[the
matter is **existential,** meaning **each is willing to expend
considerable capital and take significant risks to resolve the conflict
in their favor**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### U.S. missile sales to Ukraine will cause greater Russian escalation, increasing devastation for its people.

**Davis, '18** \[Daniel, senior fellow for Defense Priorities and a
former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army who retired in 2015 after
twenty-one years, including four combat deployments; "What Does America

https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/what-does-america-gain-by-arming-ukraine-24901\]

Thus, [[no matter how it is billed in Washington, this sale will not
"push back" against Russian aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}, nor is it
in the "interests of our nation." But [while [sending these missiles
isn't enough to tip the military balance in Ukraine, it is more than
enough to convince Russia to increase its
involvement]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those [[missiles represent]{.mark} a
[clear increase in the risk to Russia and their proxy forces]{.mark}
within eastern Ukraine [because it signals]{.mark} that [Washington may
be willing to provide even greater lethal support to their opponent. It
is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[likely Moscow will take stronger
action to counter the threat to discourage]{.mark} even [greater
American engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
support [[could take the form of Putin sending more armor, anti-armor
missiles]{.mark} of his own, [more unofficial Russian troops, greater
intelligence support for allied forces, or some other response that
brings more violence and destruction to the Donbas]{.mark}
region]{.underline}---the people we're ostensibly trying to help. It is
reasonable and appropriate for the United States to promote the good of
others abroad and to champion our values as an exemplar, a shining city
on a hill. But we should only use, or threaten to use, military power
when American security, economic prosperity, or our way of life are
directly threatened. [[Washington's intention with the missile sale may
be to increase the pain felt by Putin to drive him to a negotiated
settlement, but the actual result will almost certainly be]{.mark} a
[further militarization of the situation and]{.mark} an [increase
in]{.mark} the [potential for]{.mark} an [expansion of]{.mark} the
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Far from improving American security,
this sale will undermine it. [[Far from protecting Ukrainians,
sending]{.mark} these [missiles will place them at increasing
risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales will not help Ukraine win its war with Russia while simultaneously escalating the violence against its people and destroying U.S.-Russia relations.

[[Some leaders in Washington have advocated for the sale of missiles to
damage or destroy Russian tanks in eastern Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}
ever since Moscow intervened in its neighbor's affairs. [[These
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[will have **no impact on the
fighting** beyond a front line that has been mostly **static for
years**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Beyond the battlefield, however, [[this
will further **poison whatever bilateral relationship the U.S. has left
with Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and that is bad for America.
[[Sending arms to Ukraine is **far more likely to escalate a conflict**
whose outcome is vital to Russia's national security interest and, at
best, peripheral to America's]{.mark}.]{.underline} While deterring more
violence in eastern Ukraine may be the stated objective, [[shipping
advanced weapons into a conflict zone is bound to **end up badly for
Ukrainians**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- who simply want the violence to
end --- [[and for the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, a country that should not be plunging
into another tangential foreign policy commitment.

The efforts of these individuals haven't been in vain. U.S. President
Donald Trump will soon decide whether to implement their proposal, and
key members of his national security and military team favor doing so,
according to recent statements from General Joseph Dunford, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Kurt Volker, Trump's top negotiator on
the Ukraine crisis. Defense Secretary James Mattis has confirmed that
the option was being "actively reviewed." Arming Ukraine won't make
Putin cry uncle. [[Those who call for sending lethal arms to Ukraine
\[are\]]{.underline}]{.mark} (the United States and some of its NATO
allies already train Ukrainian troops, and the United States has been
providing nonlethal arms to Ukraine to the tune of \$300 million in 2016
alone) [claim that American weaponry will strengthen Kiev]{.underline}'s
hand and [compel]{.underline} [Russian President Vladimir Putin to
negotiate a just political settlement that ends the war in Ukraine's
Donbas region.]{.underline} **[They're
[misguided]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Worse, [their proposal could be
dangerous]{.underline}, for Ukraine and the United States. [[Arming
Ukraine won't make Putin cry uncle]{.mark}.]{.underline} Past
experience---notably [[Moscow]{.mark}'s [stepped-up
intervention]{.mark}]{.underline} to save its Donbas clients [in the
battles for Ilovaisk and Novoazovsk [in 2014 and 2015]{.mark} and
Debaltseve in 2015]{.underline}---suggests [that [Putin will]{.mark}
continue to [reinforce]{.mark} Russia's [proxies]{.mark}, especially [if
they suffer setbacks at the hands of better-armed Ukrainian
troops]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because Russia and Ukraine share a border[,
[Putin can send forces and weapons to the battlefield far faster than
the United States can resupply Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Most
importantly, [Ukraine matters far more to Russia than to the United
States]{.underline}. Indeed, even the advocates for arming Ukraine
disavow any intention to send American troops to fight for the
Ukrainians, knowing full well that such a recommendation would doom
their efforts. By contrast[, [Putin hasn't hesitated to order Russian
troops into battle]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Donbas, where many have
been killed. [[His]{.mark} popularity [ratings]{.mark} nevertheless
[remain sky-high]{.mark}. Eighty-seven percent of Russians support his
handling of foreign affairs---about the same as did in
2014]{.underline}. There is no evidence that the war in Ukraine has
dented Putin's popularity, let alone enabled opposition leaders to
mobilize support against his government. Yet proponents of providing
Ukraine lethal arms suggest that because of the bite of Western
sanctions and Russians' mounting unhappiness with the war, Putin
desperately wants to escape what they portray as the Donbas quagmire. In
fact, [although Russia has now endured political isolation and Western
economic penalties for over three years as a consequence of Putin's
annexation of Crimea and instigation of the war in eastern Ukraine, he
has not made a single significant concession or shown any inclination to
sacrifice the Donbas insurgents]{.underline}. Instead[, [he has stuck
by]{.underline}]{.mark} [them]{.underline} and, as [his military
escalations in 2014 and 2015]{.mark} show, bailed them out when
necessary. [[The proposition that Putin won't be provoked by a U.S.
decision to send]{.mark} lethal [arms to Ukraine **amounts to a
hunch**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's not supported by evidence[, and
[Putin's past behavior contradicts]{.underline}]{.mark} it. This is not
a minor point: if he does ramp up the war and the Ukrainian army is
forced into retreat, the United States will face three bad choices.

months]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The first]{.underline}]{.mark}
transaction in December 2017 [[was limited to small
arms]{.underline}]{.mark} that at least could be portrayed as purely
defensive weapons. That agreement included the export of Model M107A1
Sniper Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories, [[a
sale valued at \$41.5 million]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A transaction in
April 2018 was **more serious**. Not only was it larger (\$47 million),
it included **far more lethal weaponry**, particularly 210 Javelin
anti-tank missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}---the kind of [[weapons
that]{.underline}]{.mark} Barack [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
administration [[had declined to give Kiev]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Needless to say, [[the **Kremlin was not pleased** about either
sale]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, [[Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}
soon [[passed legislation in May that authorized \$250 million in
military assistance, including **lethal weaponry**, to Ukraine in
2019]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Congress had twice voted for military
support on a similar scale during the]{.mark} last years of
[Obama]{.mark}'s [administration, but the White House blocked
implementation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Trump administration
**cleared that obstacle out of the way** in December 2017 at the same

#### U.S. military training after lethal weapons sales to Ukraine will cause an armed confrontation with Russia.

After all, Ukraine is a European headache. The US Navy is already
present in Ochakov. **[[Their military presence so close to Russia's
borders cannot go unnoticed by Moscow. Washington will be responsible
for the consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Russia has not deployed its
military along the American border. Nor has it sent weapons to any US

[[Washington's move to provide **U.S. lethal weapons stockpiles** to the
Ukrainians could have an **adverse impact** on
**all**]{.mark}]{.underline} of these [**[diplomatic
processes]{.underline}**. [By throwing the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited

giant step toward further American involvement** in the likely event
that Moscow escalates and the Ukrainian government asks for more
weapons]{.underline}. [This is a **frightening
possibility**]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} particularly for
Americans who would prefer not to intervene on behalf of a nation that
is not even a member of NATO and whose political direction is irrelevant
to America's policy in Europe. The unanswered questions are nearly
endless, and there is no sign the White House has even begun thinking
about them. What, for instance, is the U.S. objective in Ukraine other
than simply trying to bleed the Russians in a proxy conflict? [[When ---
not if --- Russia escalates, what would the Trump administration do to
counter it? How far is the U.S. willing to go to frustrate Moscow's
ambitions in a country it sees as an extension of its former]{.mark}
Soviet [glory?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[What if
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, in his desire to respond to what he regards
as American aggression in his own backyard, [[seeks to expand the
conflict by stirring up pro-Moscow sentiment among]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[Russian-speaking populations of the Baltics? What would NATO
do]{.underline}]{.mark} in that situation[[?]{.underline}]{.mark} Is
NATO even prepared for such a contingency? And if they are not, how is
any other Eastern European nation supposed to have any confidence in
NATO when the transatlantic alliance can't even defend its own members?
When you get down to the core of the matter, the [[**turbulent waters**
of Ukrainian politics have the potential to send the American ship of
state straight towards the **dangerous rocks of a geopolitical
crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} of its own making. [[The smartest move for
Washington is to stay in the harbor]{.underline}]{.mark} and cede the
waters to captains who have more at stake.

**[[Picking a fight with a declining, nuclear power over Ukraine is the
exact opposite of wise]{.underline}]{.mark}**; remember, Ukraine is not
an ally. [[Russia has **so much more at stake in the outcome than the
U.S.,** so the former will always be more willing to make]{.mark} the
[**necessary sacrifices** to achieve its desired political end]{.mark}
state]{.underline}. In many respects, [[the Trump administration's
decision to send anti-tank missiles to Kiev is a perfect example of
Washington's reactionary, rather than strategic, foreign
policy]{.underline}.]{.mark} Sometimes it is appropriate for the United
States to respond harshly to Russian behavior, notably when the
malignant behavior conflicts with our vital interests --- our security,
prosperity and our republic. When no vital interests are at stake,
however, it is more appropriate to collaborate with Moscow in an attempt
to resolve a dispute diplomatically. And [[in]{.mark}]{.underline} still
other areas --- **[[strategic arms control]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for
instance --- [[the U.S. and Russia have a responsibility to work
together in order to promote mutual understanding between the two
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}. The bipartisan foreign policy
establishment in Washington ought to adopt a page out of the realist
textbook: [[Intervening in peripheral conflicts that are separate from
America's core national security interests is a drain on America's
limited resources and a **dangerous step toward unnecessary
confrontation**.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's past time to start taking
advice from those who counsel more restraint in national security
decision-making.

### EXT: U.S.-Russia Nuclear War Terminal Impacts

#### U.S.-Russia confrontation over Ukraine risks a global nuclear war. One flashpoint would be enough.

**Deutsch, '15** \[Judith, former president of Science for Peace, who
studied history and literature at UCLA and social work at U.C. Berkeley;
"Russia, Ukraine and U.S. Hegemony;" Counterpunch, July 9, 2015;
https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/07/09/russia-ukraine-and-u-s-hegemony/\]

[[The Ukraine/Russia conflict is particularly ominous because tensions
with the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.mark}t]{.underline}ates
[[could **escalate**]{.mark} [into]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[nuclear
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For this reason, it is necessary to
understand NATO's role, patterns of U.S. domination and the nuclear arms
race. [[The political world is **dangerously in flux,** with entangled
military and economic alliances and a **robust weapons
trade**.]{.underline} [This is similar to the **prelude to World War I**
when it took **one trigger to unleash cascading inter-state
violence.**]{.underline}]{.mark} The demonization of Russia and Putin
leaves out the role of the United States and NATO. Seumas Milne, writes
in The Guardian, March 4, 2015, "A quarter of a century after the end of
the Cold War, the 'Russian threat' is unmistakably back. Vladimir Putin,
Britain's defence secretary Michael Fallon declares, is as great a
danger to Europe as 'Islamic State'... "Putin's authoritarian
conservatism may offer little for Russia's future, but this anti-Russian
incitement is dangerous folly. There certainly has been military
expansionism. But it has overwhelmingly come from NATO, not Moscow."
James [Bissett]{.underline} is a [former Canadian ambassador to
Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria]{.underline}. He [wrote]{.underline}
in the Ottawa Citizen last year, "[[The current crisis in Ukraine
threatens global security and at worst has **the potential for nuclear
catastrophe**.]{.underline}]{.mark} At best, [[it
signals]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[continuation of the Cold
War]{.underline}.]{.mark} Sadly, [the crisis is completely unnecessary
and the responsibility lies entirely in the hands of the United
States-led NATO powers.]{.underline} The almost virulent propaganda
onslaught blaming Russia for the instability and violence in Ukraine
simply ignores reality and the facts."

#### The Ukraine conflict constitutes a proxy war between nuclear armed U.S. and Russia which could end all life on earth.

**Deutsch, '15** \[Judith, former president of Science for Peace, who
studied history and literature at UCLA and social work at U.C. Berkeley;
"Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the Threat of Nuclear War;"
Science for Peace, May 22, 2015;
https://scienceforpeace.ca/ukraine-russia-the-united-states-and-the-threat-of-nuclear-war/\]

[[What makes Ukraine/Russia so dangerous is that it is a proxy war
between nuclear-armed United States and Russia.]{.underline}]{.mark} An
advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice ruled that even
threatening to use nuclear weapons is a violation of international law,
yet the United States ambiguously threatens their use in a "first
strike". In 2002, G.W. Bush unilaterally pulled out of the Anti
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. The 1972 ABM treaty was the cornerstone
of nuclear weapons deterrence and international security. During the
Cold War there was a belief that there could be no winners because of
"mutually assured destruction". But the development of missile defense,
with technology capable of detecting missiles within one minute of
launch, has led to the U.S. believing it can win a nuclear war. The
missile defense system has been called an "offense" system. Putin has
recently said that missile defense "creates the dangerous illusion of
invincibility." He also said that US unilateral withdrawal from the ABM
in 2002 "poses a threat not only to Russia's security, but also to the
entire world." (Tass, 4 December 2014 ). In October 2014, President
Obama provocatively allocated \$1.1tn to upgrade nuclear weapons.
[[There is increasingly open talk supporting the nuclear option. "A
senior Ukrainian official is urging the West to risk a nuclear
conflagration in support of a 'full-scale war' with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that he says authorities in Kiev are now
seeking, another sign of the extremism that pervades the year-old
U.S.-backed regime in Kiev. In a recent interview with Canada's CBC
Radio, Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said,
'Everybody is afraid of fighting with a nuclear state. We are not
anymore, in Ukraine -- we've lost so many people of ours, we've lost so
much of our territory....' 11 In response, Robert Parry asks "[[Why
should such]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline} pedestrian [[dispute justify
the possibility of vaporizing millions of human beings and conceivably
ending life on the planet?....]{.underline}]{.mark} If we begin to
notice that the right-wing regime in Kiev is crazy and brutal, we might
also start questioning the 'Russian aggression' mantra.... Yet, what is
perhaps most remarkable about Prystaiko's 'Dr. Strangelove' moment is
that it produced almost no reaction in the west." 12 On April 23, 2015,
MEPs (Members of European Parliament) declared that the EU's readiness
for nuclear war "is one of the best steps to deter Russia from further
aggression." 13

#### Risk of U.S.-Russian war over Ukraine is substantial now. An escalation in the Donbas would pit the U.S. against Russian-suppled separatists in Russia's near-abroad.

[[The U.S. has pledged]{.mark} its [support for Ukraine in a conflict

continued casualties on both sides and a flare-up involving Russia\'s

in November, the conflict remained \"unchanging.\" [[A flare-up in
Ukraine would **likely pit the U.S. against a foe it has accused of
being supplied by Russia**]{.mark},]{.underline} which according to
local reports has supplied the separatists with up to 680 tanks. The
forces in charge of Donbass have not demonstrated any aerial or naval
capabilities, but they have been known to wield powerful anti-tank and
anti-air weaponry. Farley said that [[the **risk of an inter-state
conflict here involving the U.S., the EU, Russia, Ukraine and NATO was
\"still significant**]{.mark}**\"**]{.underline} here[, [a region Moscow
considered its **\"near abroad.\"**]{.underline}]{.mark} In a way, he

expert to link the two.

To be sure, [[Russia seems to lack any interest in disrupting the status
quo]{.underline}]{.mark} ahead of the Ukrainian elections, [[while the

[[capacity to consequentially change facts on the

[even a small shift could threaten the uneasy balance]{.mark}** [that
has held for the last several years, potentially **throwing Eastern

#### U.S.-Russian nuclear war would cause extinction. Escalation means civilization wouldn't survive.

**Fleck, 6/1/19** \[Martin, program director for the Physicians for
Social Responsibility's nuclear weapons abolition program; "What a
Nuclear War Would Mean;" The Progressive, June 1, 2019;
https://progressive.org/magazine/what-a-nuclear-war-would-mean-fleck/\]

[[A Physicians for Social Responsibility study modeled the humanitarian
impact of **detonating 300 Russian nuclear weapons over U.S. cities.**
The study found **75 to 100 million people would die within thirty
minutes**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} The so-called national defense
policies of the nine nations with nuclear weapons include the
ever-present threat of using them to burn to death millions of civilians
who live in other nations. But since no one can actually win a nuclear
war, the entire idea of achieving "security" through nuclear weapons is
a false narrative. That's why three-quarters of the nations on Earth
have called for totally eliminating them. The Joint Statement on the
Humanitarian Consequences of Nuclear Weapons, submitted to the United
Nations General Assembly in 2014 and signed by 155 U.N. countries, puts
it plainly: "The only way to guarantee that nuclear weapons will never
be used again is through their total elimination." These are among the
effects we could expect if a nuclear war were to happen: A typical
modern nuclear weapon can easily reduce the entire downtown of a city to
rubble. Hiroshima was flattened by an American bomb with a "yield"
equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT. Modern thermonuclear weapons are many
times more powerful. Current American and Russian land-based missiles
carry warheads ranging from 100 to 800 kilotons. That's six to
fifty-three times the size of the Hiroshima bomb. If a modern weapon is
detonated over a city, it will burn everything flammable in an area at
least four miles across. In Hiroshima, temperatures at ground zero were
equivalent to the surface of the sun. If a modern weapon is detonated
over a city, it will burn everything flammable in an area at least four
miles across. The Hiroshima bomb immediately killed 70,000 people,
mostly from burns. By the end of 1945, that death toll had doubled.
"Each person who died had a name. Each person was loved by someone,"
said survivor Setsuko Thurlow in a 2017 International Campaign to
Abolish Nuclear Weapons address to the U.N. General Assembly after 122
countries had voted in favor of adopting the Treaty on the Prohibition
of Nuclear Weapons. Physicians and relief agencies such as the
International Committee of the Red Cross warn that in the event of a
nuclear attack, doctors and other health professionals would not be able
to deliver medical assistance to immediate survivors. In Hiroshima, the
atomic bomb killed or injured 90 percent of doctors and nurses in the
area and destroyed 80 percent of the hospitals. Since there can be no
meaningful medical response to a nuclear attack on a city, prevention is
the only cure. "Fallout" refers to lethal radioactive materials lofted
into the air by the nuclear blast that eventually settle back to earth,
often far from the target. If a modern nuclear weapon is used against a
military base or city, the fallout plume could extend hundreds of miles
downwind. [[Scientific climate modeling demonstrates that in a nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[burning cities could inject enough soot
and smoke into the stratosphere to blot out the sun, dramatically
**disrupt the climate, ruin crop production, and put billions of people
at risk of starvation.**]{.mark}]{.underline} No one can confidently
predict how a nuclear war might end[. [If nuclear weapons are used
again, it could easily **escalate to involve the big
arsenals**---thousands of nuclear weapons. **It's hard to imagine how
civilization would survive the resulting
apocalypse.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Here's the thing to remember: If the
missiles take flight, we'll all become peace activists. But [[it will be
**too late**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Terrorism Add-on

[[Washington has confirmed]{.mark} the [delivery o]{.mark}f]{.underline}
FGM-148 [[Javelin anti-tank missile systems to
Kiev]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ukrainian personnel start training with the
new weapons on May 2. The aid package approved in March specified 210
Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 Javelin launchers. Since 2014, the US
has provided over \$850 million to bolster Ukraine's security. Although
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 allocates
\$350 million for this purpose, [[this is the **first time Kiev has
received lethal weapons** from Washington. Shipments
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Barrett M107A1 [[rifles are
next]{.underline}]{.mark}. The news has come at a time when the
"anti-terror operation" (ATO) in the separatist Donbas region in eastern
Ukraine has just ended (on April 30), to be replaced by a joint-forces
operation (JFO). The regular military, the security forces (the SBU),
the police, the national guard, and the border service will all be
united under one command. The SBU had been in charge before what is
being called the Donbas "reintegration law" was signed and took effect
in late February. The US supports the idea of bringing in UN
peacekeepers who will be deployed under the terms demanded by Kiev. From
now on, the talks between Volker and Surkov will be seen in a different
light, because [[Washington is]{.underline}]{.mark} no longer a
mediator, but rather an accomplice who is [**[fueling the
conflict]{.underline}**. [With]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[**explicit US
support**, Kiev will double down on its military solution. **Corruption
is rampant** in Ukraine. It will be no surprise if the **weapons fall

We are told that [[ISIS is planning terrorist attacks in

[[creators.]{.underline}]{.mark} Like clockwork[, **[eight months later

Times was reporting that three full Islamic battalions were fighting in
eastern Ukraine. At about the same time, Elliot Friedland in The Jewish
Voice was warning against the problems arising from this Islamic
incursion in Ukraine: Yet there are Islamist paramilitary battalions
fighting alongside Ukrainian forces, which are aligned with the Islamic
State and Chechen Islamist factions. **[[If the U.S. steps up military
aid to Ukraine, whose army is notoriously corrupt, it may fall into the

a mixture of Ukrainian oligarchs, Gulf patrons, violent crime and
extortion. The Ruskayya Blatina website said that a few militias
belonging to the terrorist group ISIS began to fight against the Russian
soldiers in Ukraine with support from the American authorities who gave
recommendations to the Ukrainian government regarding the Islamic State
\... **[[Islamic State-aligned fighters]{.underline}]{.mark}** also

instrument of official policy has not abated one bit. Neither has its
belief in hypocrisy,\" Swaraj said. \"[[The biggest challenge of our era

**transported** through]{.underline}]{.mark} the Ukrainian Black Sea

Experts worry that [[more **arms in Ukraine could lead to more arms
being trafficked** to and within Europe]{.mark},]{.underline} much as
the war in the Balkans in the 1990s led to an estimated 6 million guns
now circulating on the continent. [[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[evidence that many of the arms now in the control of non-state groups
in Ukraine fall into the hands of **organized crime groups selling arms

No one doubts [[Russia invading parts of Ukraine is

and]{.mark}]{.underline} just recently, that [\$[400 million of military

should consider the consequences of sending weapons first and asking
questions later.]{.underline}]{.mark} Helping to escalate a military
confrontation against the nation with the largest nuclear weapons supply
in the world could have some consequences beyond the simple front page

### EXT: Terrorism Terminal Impacts

#### Al Qaeda and ISIS pose existential threats to the U.S., Middle East, Europe and the world.

[[Salafi-jihadi military organizations, particularly **ISIS and al
Qaeda**, are the **greatest threat to the security and values** of
American and European citizens. **ISIS and al Qaeda pose an existential
threat** because they **accelerate the collapse of world order, provoke
domestic and global trends that endanger American values and way of
life, and plan direct attacks** against the U.S. and its
partners]{.underline}. [Syrian al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra poses
one of the most significant long-term threats]{.underline}]{.mark} of
any Salafi-jihadi group. This al Qaeda affiliate has established an
expansive network of partnerships with local oppositions groups that
have grown either dependent on or fiercely loyal to the organization.
[[Its defeat and destruction must be one of the **highest priorities**
of any strategy to defend the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Europe from al Qaeda attacks. ISIS
and al Qaeda are **more than terrorist groups**; they are
**insurgencies**]{.mark}. [They use terrorism]{.mark} as a tactic, [but
these organizations are insurgencies that aim]{.mark} first [to
**overthrow all existing governments** in the Muslim world and replace
them with their own, and later, to **attack the West**]{.mark} [**from a
position of power** to spread their ideology to **all of
humanity**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Separating the elements of ISIS and al
Qaeda that are actively working to attack the West from the main bodies
of those groups fighting in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia is
impossible. [[All al Qaeda groups and ISIS affiliates seek to **take the
war into the West** to fulfill their grand strategic objective of
establishing a **global caliphate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, albeit
according to different timelines.

#### U.S. counter-terrorism operations in the Middle East have dehumanized and killed four million people.

Across the Middle East;" Global Research, December 31, 2018;
https://www.globalresearch.ca/war-terror-left-millions-dead-middle-east/5664327\]

As [[research reveals]{.underline}]{.mark} of late,
"[[counter-terrorism" operations led by the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates over many years [[have wrought
**increasing devastation**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Not to mention,
**[[continuing and worsening repercussions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A
rough estimate of **[[four million Muslims have died as a result of
US-led wars in the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- dating to the
early 1990s Gulf War against Iraq. The Gulf War was waged by the US,
with France, Britain and Saudi Arabia providing welcome support. It was
in response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in early August 1990
-- the Iraqi dictator having unwisely disobeyed orders from his Western
masters. However, it was the Iraqi civilian population who would pay the
real price, and not for the last time. For 42 successive days and
nights, US-led coalition forces subjected Iraq to one of the most
destructive aerial assaults in military history. Over 88,000 tons of
bombs were unloaded on Iraqi soil from mid-January 1991 to the end of
February. Much of the bombing fell upon civilian areas. Hussein's attack
on Kuwait the previous year had drawn "international condemnation". The
above bombardments, infinitely greater in destruction, were met with
approval in some quarters and silence in others. By this point, Western
governments had already placed "genocidal" sanctions on Iraq -- an
immediate response to Hussein's occupation of Kuwait. The sanctions
lasted a staggering 13 years (1990-2003) and brought unaccountable
suffering. The lack of basic needs particularly affected Iraqi children,
with those aged under 14 comprising 45% of Iraq's population. Such
measures were still "worth it", as declared infamously in 1996 by
Madeleine Albright, former US Secretary of State. In the early 21st
century, the September 11 atrocities were used as a pretext to resume
military operations in the Middle East. Afghanistan, Iraq, and to a
lesser extent (nuclear-armed) Pakistan came under Western bombardment or
invasion. Indeed, today's civilian death toll could be as high as six to
eight million, when taking into account "higher avoidable death
estimates" in Afghanistan. A few weeks after September 11, the US
unleashed its aerial campaign on Afghanistan. Abdul Haq, a respected
anti-Taliban figure, described president George W. Bush's air raids as
"a big setback" in their fight to topple the Taliban from inside. We
Should Listen to the Iraqi Parliament Informed beforehand that any
assault on Afghan territory was illegal, president Bush responded, "I
don't care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some
ass". Aid organisations working in Afghanistan insisted any bombings
would result in a humanitarian catastrophe. Again, such warnings
appeared of no consequence to the Pentagon. Haq, the Taliban opposition
leader, further said: "They \[US\] don't care about the suffering of the
Afghans, or how many people we will lose". The British investigative
journalist Nafeez Ahmed wrote in June 2017, "Due to severe lack of data
in Iraq, almost complete non-existence of records in Afghanistan, and
the indifference of Western governments to civilian deaths, it is
literally impossible to determine the true extent of loss of life". The
mainstream press also bears responsibility for the "lack of data" and
"non-existence" of reliable death counts. Few Western reporters are ever
on the ground to witness the reality unfolding before the eyes, let
alone to report on it accurately. [[Middle Eastern citizens have long
come under the **Orwellian heading of "unpeople**". Their **existence is
barely**]{.mark} [**acknowledged** even after they are
killed]{.mark}.]{.underline} By contrast, mass shootings in the US
receive enormous attention despite the minuscule death tolls in
comparison.

#### Nuclear terrorism is a particularly significant risk in the Middle East: theft, sabotage, dirty bombs and nuclear power expansion.

[[All participants]{.underline}]{.mark} in this roundtable
[[agree]{.underline}]{.mark} that[, [despite]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[achievements of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Nuclear Security
Summits]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [**[threat of nuclear terrorism is not
necessarily diminishing. In the Middle East, nuclear terrorism seems
a]{.mark} [particularly immediate concern]{.mark}**.]{.underline} True,
the region lacks large quantities of highly enriched uranium and
plutonium. But [[its **political instability** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [tendency toward [**violent extremism** ]{.mark}]{.underline}are
conditions that can [[enable nuclear terrorism.]{.mark}]{.underline}
According to the 2016 Nuclear Security Index, published by the Nuclear
Threat Initiative (NTI), [[Middle Eastern nations **rank poorly when it
comes to safeguarding their nuclear materials from theft**.]{.mark} Of
the 24 countries that possess at least 1 kilogram of weapons-usable
nuclear materials, two are Middle Eastern: Israel and Iran. The Index
ranks these countries near the bottom of the theft-protection
list.]{.underline} Israel comes in at number 20 and Iran at 23.
[Among]{.underline} the [152 countries with less than 1 kilogram of
weapons-usable nuclear materials, about a dozen are Middle Eastern. They
are all over the lot in their vulnerability to theft]{.underline}---from
the United Arab Emirates at number 24 to Syria at 151 (just above
Somalia). Clearly, [[the region\'s efforts to prevent nuclear theft are
not strong enough]{.underline}. **[Where vulnerability to nuclear
sabotage is concerned, the Middle East does even
worse]{.underline}**]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Of the 45 countries in
NTI\'s sabotage index, five are Middle Eastern. Israel---the
highest-ranking of the five---comes in at number 36. Iran is tied with
North Korea for last place. And as my roundtable colleague Hubert Foy
has discussed, [concern about nuclear materials is not limited to
fissile materials**. [Radiological sources]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[an issue of **pressing
concern**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The Middle East\'s generally **lax
security environment**, along with its **political instability**, makes
**the misuse of radiological sources more likely** in this region
than]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[many other places]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Civilian radiological sources are ubiquitous, particularly in medicine.
They would be relatively easy to access in children\'s hospitals, for
example. Luckily, most radioactive sources are not easily dispersible.
Their half-lives are short. They could contaminate only limited areas.
Moreover, anyone attempting to steal an unshielded source might die from
acute radiation exposure. Still, [[using a radiological source in a
\"dirty bomb\" could create panic and terror]{.underline}]{.mark} in
local populations. [[A]{.mark} [dirty bomb would turn affected areas
into **no-go zones** for]{.mark}]{.underline} a number of [[**years**,
which would have **profound economic repercussions**. Another reason to
be concerned about Middle Eastern nuclear security is the planned
**expansion of nuclear power** in the region]{.underline}.]{.mark} Some
nations, pointing toward Iran\'s limited right to enrich uranium under
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, will also wish to enrich uranium
domestically. To be sure, such nations have the right to pursue the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including uranium enrichment. But in
order to alleviate international concerns about their enrichment
capacity, [[these nations must develop robust laws regarding nuclear
security]{.mark}.]{.underline} [They must establish procedures for
secure]{.underline} interim [storage of nuclear materials]{.underline}.
And [they must make final disposition plans for spent fuel and
radioactive waste.]{.underline}

#### Terrorist attacks, particularly nuclear terrorism, can precipitate massive nuclear exchanges.

In 2010, Robert Ayson reviewed the potential linkages between
inter-state nuclear war and non-state terrorism. He concluded:
"...\[T\]hese [[two nuclear worlds---**a non-state actor nuclear attack
and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not necessarily
separable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is just possible that some sort of
[[terrorist attack,]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[especially an act of
nuclear terrorism, could **precipitate a chain of events leading to a
massive exchange of nuclear weapons between two or** ]{.mark}**m[ore of
the states ]{.mark}**[that possess them."]{.mark}\[]{.underline}5\] How
this linkage might unfold is the subject of the next sections of this
essay.

[[Although only a few non-state actors such as **Al Qaeda and Islamic
State** have exhibited]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[underlying stamina
and organizational capacities and actually attempted to obtain nuclear
weapons-related skills, hardware, and materials]{.underline}]{.mark},
the [**[past is not prologue]{.mark}**. [An **incredibly diverse set of
variously motivated terrorist groups exist already,**]{.mark} including
politico-ideological, apocalyptic-millenarian, politico-religious,

some of which converge with criminal-military and

cults, lone wolves, and]{.mark} ephemeral [copy-cat non-state
actors]{.mark}. The [social, economic, and deculturating **conditions
that generate such entities are likely to persist and even
expand.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Nonetheless, [[those that have occurred **demonstrate
unambiguously**]{.underline}]{.mark} that such [[threats and attacks are
**not merely hypothetical,** in spite of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[limiting conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} outlined above. [[One survey
documented **eighty actual, planned attacks** on nuclear facilities
containing nuclear materials between
1961-2016]{.underline}]{.mark}\[13\] as follows: 80 attacks in 3 waves
(1970s armed assaults, 1990s thefts, post-2010, breaches) High threat
attacks: 32/80 attacks posed substantial, verified threat of which 44
percent involved insiders. All types of targets were found in the data
set---[[on reactors, other nuclear facilities, military
bases]{.underline}]{.mark} leading Gary Ackerman and to conclude:
"Overall[, [**empirical evidence** suggests that there are **sufficient
cases**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in each of the]{.underline} listed
[categories [that **no type of threat can be
ignored**]{.mark}]{.underline}."\[14\] [[No region was immune; no year
was without such a threat or attack.]{.underline}]{.mark} Thus, [[there
is a likely to be a **coincidence of future non-state threats and
attacks with inter-state nuclear-prone
conflicts**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} as in the past, and [[possibly
**more**]{.mark} so [given the current trend]{.mark} in [and]{.mark} the
[generative conditions for global terrorist activity that will **likely

[[The US is to render substantial military assistance to a country with

those weapons fall into the wrong hands and are used against the US

]{.mark}]{.underline}this year [[**slamming Ukraine's human-rights
record**. The UN human-rights commissioner tells the same story. So do

[[Deliveries of lethal weapons to one of the **most corrupt countries**

to]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[cozy relationships with]{.mark} the
[powers that be]{.mark}.]{.underline} The conflict in the Donbas is
being used to distract public attention from the worsening domestic
problems. [[Washington is turning a **blind eye to the abuse of
power**]{.underline}]{.mark} in that country because Kiev has agreed to
relinquish its own national sovereignty and allow itself to be turned
into a tool of US foreign policy. It has recently joined an anti-Russia
bloc of three nations and was rewarded by being granted an official
status in NATO.

#### U.S. arms sales support a Neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine.

First, [[we had US government envoy]{.underline}]{.mark} Kurt [[Volker
announcing]{.underline}]{.mark} this week that [[an additional \$250
million in military weapons were being packaged in Congress for
Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Then the DC-based international lending
institutions, the IMF and World Bank, signed off on multi-billion-dollar
loans for Poroshenko's regime. US government-owned Radio Free Europe
described the new financial loans as a "victory" for Poroshenko. The
apparent investor confidence bestowed by the Washington-based
"development agencies" will boost the incumbent president's re-election
prospects in the forthcoming ballot in March. Up until recently,
Poroshenko was trailing in opinion polls and looked set for a trouncing
defeat in the election. How convenient that the IMF and World Bank --
under the control of US government -- should step up to the plate with a
very big helping hand. And that's not seen as interference in a
country's sovereign affairs? Since the CIA-backed coup d'état in Kiev in
February 2014 against the elected government of Viktor Yanukovych, it is
estimated that the US has provided the cabal that seized power with up
to \$1 billion in military aid. And those dubious gifts keep coming,
with the envoy Kurt Volker this week announcing to a forum in Brussels
that the US Congress is processing an additional \$25o million[. [It
doesn't seem to bother American lawmakers that the Kiev regime is
dominated by **Neo-Nazi demagogues** and paramilitaries who]{.mark}
[worship]{.mark}]{.underline} Stepan Bandera and other [[Ukrainian
**collaborators in the Third Reich's Final
Solution**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Just recently President Poroshenko was
photographed inspecting Ukrainian special forces some of whom were
donning insignia of the Third Reich's SS. As Russian President Vladimir
Putin pointed out in his annual press conference this week, the Kiev
regime has been waging a war and a blockade against its own Ukrainian
citizens in the eastern Donbas region for over four years, in which
civilians continue to be killed on a daily basis. One reason why that
war remains largely unknown in the West is that western news media don't
report on it. Or when they do, they distort with lies that Russia has
"invaded Ukraine". This is similar to how the Western news media largely
"forgot" to report on the war in Yemen, and when they have bothered to
mention Yemen at all, they again distort by calling it a proxy war with
Iran. [[The Ukraine war against the ethnic Russian people of eastern
Ukraine is driven by a rabid Russophobia subscribed to by the Kiev
regime consistent with the **exterminatory mentality of the Third
Reich** with whom their **antecedents collaborated with during the
Second World War**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The criminal recklessness of
Washington knows no bounds. Just as President Donald
[[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} announces this week that he is pulling out
American troops from Syria (illegally present there for the past four
years), the same administration [[is stepping up]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [[military involvement in Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} After the
November 25 incident in the Kerch Strait when three heavily armed
Ukrainian warships violated Russia's maritime border, one might have
thought that the US backers of the Kiev regime would have prevailed upon
it with caution not to incite Russia. Not a bit of it, it seems. The US
is giving notice that it is increasing its already hefty military
support. That amounts to a green light from Washington to the Kiev
regime to continue its provocations. The timing of the IMF and World
Bank financing is also blatant, and equally reprehensible. The IMF said
it had approved \$4 billion in new money for the Kiev regime, the first
tranche of which will be disbursed by December 25, Christmas Day in the
Western calendar! Together, the IMF and World Bank loans will enable the
Kiev regime to seek taking on even more debt from other international
sources, their approval acting as an endorsement of "sound economy".
Ukraine is already lumbering from huge national debts of around \$115
billion. The IMF and World Bank are therefore pushing the country into
deeper arrears. No doubt that is part of the threadbare pattern of how
Western capital will strip the country of its resources and the populace
thrown into debt slavery. Nevertheless, grave legal questions arise. It
is understood that the Bretton Woods institutions of the IMF and World
Bank, officially affiliated with the United Nations, are forbidden from
lending money to states which are in the midst of armed conflict. How is
it then possible that those institutions are bankrolling the Kiev regime
given the latter's horrendous assault on its own people in eastern
Ukraine, its explicit affiliation with Neo-Nazi ideology, and its brazen
attempts to provoke a war with Russia? Furthermore, IMF lending was
supposedly put on hold in 2017 because the Kiev regime was not complying
with demands to crack down on corruption and implement political
reforms. If anything the economic and political corruption in Ukrainian
territory under the control of the Kiev regime has become an even
bigger, more rampant problem. The IMF and World Bank announced their
"financial goodies" this week without providing any evidence of
purported conditional improvements. This all makes for a grim prognosis
over the coming months. The Kiev regime has no intention to go back to
the 2015 Minsk accords which called for a negotiated political
settlement in Ukraine. As Putin remarked recently, as long as the
current cabal in Kiev remains in power then conflict will be the order
of the day. The US government and the Washington financial institutions
are ensuring that the cabal remains in power with their generous rewards
of military and capital injections. More disturbing is that the Kiev
regime will feel emboldened to take its warmongering against Russia to
an even more reckless level. Father Christmas is supposed to reward good
boys and girls[. [For Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
[[gifts]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline} evidently [[doled out for a
**Neo-Nazi rogue regime** with blood on its hands.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### EXT: Human Rights Terminal Impacts

#### Alleviation of human rights violations is a moral imperative grounded in the mitigation of suffering. Human rights promotion can spillover and mitigate its worst excesses globally.

**Andorno & Baffone, '14** \[Roberto, Associate Professor at the Faculty
of Law, University of Zurich (Switzerland). He is also Research Fellow
at the University\'s Institute of Biomedical Ethics and Medical History;

Alleviate Suffering;" Ronald Green and Nathan Palpant (eds.), Suffering
and Bioethics, New York, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 182-200; pp.
195-196\]

We are now realizing that [[the **moral imperative to alleviate
suffering**]{.underline}]{.mark} is not just the historical factor that
motivated the emergence of human rights in the midst of the twentieth
century. It [[is]{.underline},]{.mark} still today, though often
implicitly, [[at the]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[**heart of every
serious human rights policy. Suffering is the parameter** that
determines the degree of urgency in the implementation
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [various [human rights]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, the [[interpretation and implementation of human rights norms
through the **lens of suffering** can contribute to develop
**compassion** towards others and to promote a more **effective and
proactive commitment to human rights** in the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet stressing the importance of suffering
for human rights should not be understood as meaning that we can merely
rely on a feeling of empathy to ensure their effective implementation.
As rational beings, we also need reasons for action. The efforts
oriented towards [[reducing suffering across the world need to be
addressed]{.underline}]{.mark} through the use of practical reasoning
and the guidance of a framework of universal principles that are
[[grounded on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[recognition of the **inherent
dignity** of every]{.underline}]{.mark} fellow
[[human]{.mark}]{.underline} being. Finally, it is also important to
remind that it is far beyond the scope of human rights --and of the law
in general-- to provide an efficient remedy to all forms of human
suffering and to ensure happiness. The central scope of human rights law
is much more modest: it attempts, above all, to give a response to those
practices and situations that are a more severe source of human
suffering. Returning to the Hammarskjöld's simile mentioned above, we
can conclude that [[human rights are]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly
[[unable to make our lives a paradise, but they can]{.underline}]{.mark}
at least [[help]{.mark} [to prevent that many people's lives
become]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**[hell on earth]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Human rights guarantee freedom and poverty reduction to billions. Moral imperatives must be an integral part of U.S. foreign policy.

**McCain, '17** \[ late Senator John, then Chair of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, "John McCain: Why We Must Support Human Rights;" New
York Times, May 8, 2017;
<https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/opinion/john-mccain-rex-tillerson-human-rights.html?smid=fb-share>\]

In the real world, as lived and experienced by real people, [the [demand
for human rights and dignity, the longing for **liberty and justice and
opportunity**, the hatred of oppression and corruption and cruelty is
reality. By]{.mark} [denying this experience, we deny the aspirations of
**billions** of people, and invite their enduring]{.mark}
r[esentment]{.mark}.]{.underline} America didn't invent human rights.
[[Those rights are common to all people: nations, cultures and religions
cannot choose to simply opt out of them. Human rights exist **above the
state** and beyond history. They cannot be rescinded by one government
any more than they can be granted by another. They inhabit the human
heart, and]{.underline}]{.mark} from there, [[though they may be
abridged, they can never be]{.mark}
[extinguished]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} We are a country with a
conscience. We have long believed [**[moral concerns must be an
essential part of our foreign policy]{.underline}**,]{.mark} not a
departure from it. We are the chief architect and defender of an
international order governed by rules derived from our political and
economic values. We have grown vastly wealthier and more powerful under
those rules. [[More of humanity than ever before lives in **freedom and
out of poverty** because of those rules.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The state and private individuals and organizations have moral obligations to promote and protect human rights.

**Turgendhat, 7/9/19** \[Michael, High Court judge in England and Wales;
"The Conservative Case for Human Rights;" The Political Quarterly, July
9, 2019;
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-923X.12713\]

The UDHR is itself conservative in important respects. First, the rights
spelt out are 'declared', that is, they are said to be rights which were
already recognised by all the signatories of the UDHR, not something
new. Thus they were part of the traditional values that conservatives
seek to preserve. [[The UDHR]{.underline}]{.mark} is conservative in a
second sense: it [[reflects]{.mark} the [emphasis]{.mark}]{.underline}
conservatives place [[on personal responsibility]{.underline}. [The
obligation to respect the rights set out is a **moral obligation**
binding not just on states, but]{.underline} ]{.mark}also [[upon
']{.underline}]{.mark}every individual and every organ of
so[c]{.underline}i[ety'. So, [the obligation to respect those rights
**binds non‐state actors, such as individuals, and private bodies or
institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some rights can be guaranteed only
by the state---for example, the right of access to independent courts
(UDHR article 8). But the [[duties corresponding to]{.mark}]{.underline}
other [[rights must be **fulfilled** by]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[the
**state, and private individuals or bodies**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Examples are the rights to life, liberty and security of
person]{.mark}]{.underline} (UDHR article 3), the [[rights to food and
housing]{.underline}]{.mark} (UDHR article 25) [[and to
education]{.mark}]{.underline} (UDHR article 26). And in so far [[as an
obligation to respect a right binds the state, individuals must be
**morally bound to vote for representatives who will legislate and
govern consistently with human rights.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

### North Korea Add-on

A [[White House authorization to send equipment to Kiev could
stop]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[dialogue. It's difficult to
understand]{.mark} [why the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would
**escalate the war** when there may finally be an opening to explore a
U.N.-enforced cessation of hostilities that could lead to a political
settlement]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}to the conflict. [[The Russians
could **respond to increased U.S. involvement in Ukraine** in other
ways]{.underline}]{.mark} too. [[Moscow could]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, [**[use its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to block
U.S.-led efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear
program]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Putin could expand military and
intelligence cooperation with Iran to undermine the Trump
administration's policy of containing Iranian expansionism.

#### Russian assistance to North Korea provides advanced weapons technology to thwart sanctions against the North.

**Lukin 16** \[Artyom Lukin is Deputy Director for Research at the
School of Regional and International Studies, Far Eastern Federal

At Russian universities, they mostly major in Russian language studies,
engineering, and sciences. Conclusion: Three Scenarios Given its
long-standing interests on the Korean Peninsula and its substantial
leverage, [[Russia is going to play an **active role** in the ongoing
drama centered on North Korea]{.underline}.]{.mark} The question is what
kind of a role it will be. [[Most likely, Russia's behavior will
gravitate to one of the following scenarios:]{.mark} Scenario 1.
[**Russia obstructs international efforts** to deal with North Korea.
This scenario is likely if **Russia's relations with the United States
become**]{.mark}]{.underline} even [**[worse]{.mark}**
[than]{.mark}]{.underline} they stand [[now]{.underline},]{.mark} with
the two countries entering a new edition of a bitter Cold War. In order
to punish the West, [[rather than joining in the US-led efforts to reign
in the Kim regime, Moscow will **extend Pyongyang a lifeline** that
**alleviates international pressure**.]{.underline}]{.mark}\[25\] In
extremis, [[Russia can even **resume weapons
deliveries**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the DPRK, something that Pyongyang
has long been seeking from Moscow. Some elements of this scenario,
albeit in less extreme varieties, can also materialize if Russia feels
that it is being sidelined or ignored as a major player on the Korean
Peninsula. [[Consider Russia's **reluctance to give immediate consent**
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the UNSC draft resolution [[**imposing stiff
sanctions** on North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} that was negotiated
bilaterally by the US and China in late February 2016. Moscow expressed
its displeasure over the fact that Russia's interests were not taken
into account and delayed the adoption of the resolution.\[26\] Russia
secured an important concession in the final version of the resolution
adopted by the UNSC on March 2, whereby coal originating outside the
DPRK (from Russia and Mongolia) and transported for export through the
North's port of Rajin is exempt from the general coal trade ban.\[27\]
This will ensure continued operation of the Russian-controlled
Khasan-Rajin rail link venture.

#### Further North Korean nuclear development results in a destabilizing cycle that is immune to deterrence -- that causes Korean nuclear war.

**Kelly, 15** \[Robert is an associate professor of international
relations in the Department of Political Science and Diplomacy at Pusan
National University in South Korea, "Will South Korea Eventually Feel
Compelled to Bomb NK Missile Sites?," Asian Security Blog, 3/17/15,
https://asiansecurityblog.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/will-south-korea-eventually-feel-compelled-to-bomb-nk-missile-sites/\]

My growing concern for years now is that [[the more nuclear missiles
North Korea acquires]{.underline}]{.mark} (read this on just how many
and when), [[the more they **threaten South Korea's very
existence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} To date, North Korea's missile and
nukes have generally been understood as a tool for regime security -- to
prevent an American 'regime change' attack -- or as a gangsterish way
for NK to shake-down SK, Japan, and the US for concessions. As Robert
Gates and Hillary Clinton both noted, the Norks are great at selling and
re-selling their nuclear program for aid. But, [i[f]{.mark} [NK gets
dozens, or even hundreds, of nuclear warheads and missiles, then the NK
nuclear program is no longer about regime security or blackmail. It
would then have grown into an **existential threat** to SK as a state
and society]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is why I am such a strong
supporter of THAAD. [[NK is moving from being a frightening rogue state
obsessed with survival, to a **major threat** to the constitutional
order and even **physical survival of the ROK (and
Japan)**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} To be sure, the USSR and US were that
to each other in the Cold War, but both developed technologies (SLBMs
mostly) that allowed them to survive (or 'ride out' in nuclear parlance)
even a massive first strike and still retaliate. This 'assured second
strike' capability dramatically reduced the incentive for either side to
strike first, so stabilizing the nuclear competition despite the huge
size of the arsenals. By contrast, neither NK nor SK have assured second
strike (SK might because of the American alliance, but that's not
entirely clear) which therefore incentives attacking first. Further,
[[both NK and SK are very vulnerable to a first strike,
so]{.underline}]{.mark} again the [[**incentives to move first are
high**. NK cannot hide its nuclear weapons; it is too small and US
satellite coverage too intrusive]{.underline}. [Nuclear facilities are
big and vulnerable, and]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[obvious **temptation
for an allied preemptive strike**]{.underline}. [This creates a
'**use-them-or-lose-them'** dilemma for Pyongyang]{.underline}.]{.mark}
And [[this dilemma worsens as Pyongyang builds more]{.mark} and
more,]{.underline} and spends more and more. [[The more nukes North
Korea deploys, the greater the allied temptation to destroy them before
they could be used]{.underline}]{.mark} (this was American thinking
during the Cuban Missile Crisis too). [[This
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[incentivizes NK to use
them before they're struck]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's [[a **nasty spiral
of paranoia**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[SK too is vulnerable, which again
incentivizes moving first]{.underline}. [SK cannot ride out a serious
nuclear assault, because it is a small, highly centralized state with a
highly concentrated population defenseless against missile
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} It would not take many
nuclear strikes to destabilize the Republic (unlike the US or USSR in
the Cold War). [[As Nork nukes move from a few]{.underline}]{.mark} for
security, [[to many]{.underline}]{.mark} as a state- and
society-breaking threat to SK (and even Japan[), the [incentives to
preemptively destroy them first will grow]{.mark}]{.underline} also.
This is a classic nuclear security dilemma, straight out of the Cold War
in the 1950s. The best way out of this nasty, worsening game would be
nuclear restraint on the NK part (a pipe-dream, that), and/or robust
missile defense on the SK side. THAAD is really, really important to
slow the security dilemma paranoia that accompanies arms build-ups,
especially nuclear ones. The Chinese ought to think about that before
they come out so strongly against THAAD: If South Korea is entirely
'naked' or 'roof-less' against missile attack, when NK has 100+ nuclear
missiles -- a capability that could destroy South Korea in just a few
minutes -- what does Beijing think will happen? That Seoul will just sit
back and do nothing because of trade with China? I doubt it. No SK
president could tolerate such a stark, asymmetric threat to the ROK's
very existence just to keep the Chinese mollified. That would border on
dereliction of duty. [[Even if SK did not want to strike North Korea's
nuclear sites]{.underline}]{.mark} (which I don't think it does), [[it
might feel **compelled to out of sheer fear**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These ideas were first fleshed out at The Diplomat here. That essay is
re-posted below and repeats the above discussion: "[[As North Korea
continues to develop both nuclear weapons and the missile technology to
carry them]{.mark}, the [pressure on South Korea to take preemptive
military action will gradually rise. At some point, North Korea may have
so many missiles and warheads, that South Korea considers that
capability to be an **existential threat** to Southern security. This is
the greatest long- term risk to security and stability in
Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} arguably more destabilizing than a
North Korean collapse[. [If North Korea does not arrest its nuclear and
missile programs at a reasonably small, defensively-minded deterrent,
then Southern elites will increasingly see those weapons as threats to
Southern survival, not just tools of defense]{.mark}]{.underline} or
gangsterish blackmail. During the Cold War, the extraordinary speed and
power of nuclear missiles created a bizarre and frightening 'balance of
terror.' Both the Americans and Soviets had these weapons, but they were
enormously vulnerable to a first strike. Under the logic 'use them or
lose them,' there were enormous incentives to launch first: if A did not
get its missiles out of the silos quickly enough, they might be
destroyed by B's first strike. One superpower could then hold the
other's cities hostage to nuclear annihilation and demand concessions.
This countervalue, 'city busting' temptation was eventually alleviated
by 'assured second strike' technologies, particularly submarine-launched
ballistic missiles (SLBM). SLBMs ensured the survivability of nuclear
forces; hard-to-find submarines could ride out an enemy first strike and
still retaliate. So the military value of launching first declined
dramatically. By the 1970s, both the US and the USSR had achieved enough
survivability through various 'hardening' efforts that nuclear
bipolarity was relatively stable despite the huge number of weapons in
the arms race. The Korean nuclear race does not have this stability and
is unlikely to ever achieve it. Nuclear Korea today is more like the
cold war of the 1950s, when nuclear weapons were new and destabilizing,
than in the 1970s when they had been strategically integrated, and
bipolarity was mature. Specifically, North Korea will never been able to
harden its locations well enough to achieve assured second strike. North
Korea is too small to pursue the geographic dispersion strategies the
Soviets tried, and too poor to build a reliable SLBM force or effective
air defense. Further US satellite coverage makes very hard for the North
to conceal anything of great importance. North Korea's nuclear weapons
will always be highly vulnerable. So North Korea will always face the
'use it or lose it' logic that incentives a first strike. On the
Southern side, its small size and extreme demographic concentration in a
few large cities makes the Republic of Korea an easy target for a
nuclear strike. More than half of South Korea's population lives in
greater Seoul alone (more than 20 million people), and Seoul's suburbs
begin just thirty miles from the demilitarized zone. This again raises
the temptation value of a Northern strike. Both the Soviet Union and the
United States were so large, that only a massive first strike would have
led to national collapse. In South Korea by contrast, nuking only about
five large cities would likely be enough to push South Korea toward
national-constitutional breakdown. Given its extreme urbanization and
centralization, South Korea is extremely vulnerable to a WMD and/or
decapitation strike. While large-scale North Korean offensive action is
highly unlikely -- Pyongyang's elites most likely just want to survive
to enjoy their gangster high life -- nuclear weapons do offer a
conceivable route to Northern military victory for the first time in
decades: a first-strike mix of counterforce detonations to throw the
Southern military into disarray; limited counter-value city strikes to
spur social and constitutional break-down in the South; followed by an
invasion and occupation before the US military could arrive in force;
and a standing threat to nuke Japan or the United States as well should
they intervene. Again, this is unlikely, and I still strongly believe an
allied victory is likely even if the North were to use nuclear weapons.
But [[the more nukes the North builds, the more this threat, and the
'use it or lose it' first strike incentives, grow]{.mark}.]{.underline}
It is for this reason that the US has pushed South Korea so hard on
missile defense. Not only would missile defense save lives, but it would
dramatically improve Southern national-constitutional survivability.
(Decentralization would also help enormously, and I have argued for that
repeatedly in conferences in Korea, but it is unlikely.) A missile
shield would lessen the military-offensive value of North Korea's
nuclear weapons, so reducing both first-strike temptations in Pyongyang
and preemptive air-strike pressure in Seoul. Unfortunately South Korea
is not hardened meaningfully to ride-out Northern nuclear strikes.
Missile defense in South Korea has become politicized as a US plot to
dominate South Korean foreign policy (yes, really) and provoke China.
(Although opinion may, at last, be changing on this.) Air drills are
routinely ignored. And no one I know in South Korea knows where their
shelters are or what to do in case of nuclear strike. Ideally North
Korea would de-nuclearize. And we should always keep talking to North
Korea. Pyongyang is so dangerous that freezing it out is a bad idea.
Talking does not mean we must be taken advantage of by the North's
regular bargaining gimmicks. But we must admit that North Korea seems
unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons. The program goes back decades,
to the 1960s. Rumor has it that Pyongyang devoted more than 5% of GDP in
the last two decades to developing these weapons. The program continued
through the 1990s, even as more than a million North Koreans starved to
death in a famine resulting from post-Cold War economic breakdown. The
North has repeatedly lied and flim-flammed to outsiders like the ROK
government and the IAEA to keep its programs alive clandestinely.
Recently Kim Jong Un has referred to nuclear weapons as the "nation's
life." We could even go a step further and admit that a few Northern
nuclear missiles are tolerable. If we put ourselves in Pyongyang's
shoes, a limited nuclear deterrent makes sense. Conventionally, North
Korea is falling further and further behind. No matter how big the North
Korean army gets quantitatively, it is an increasingly weak shield
against high-tech opponents. US regime change in the Middle East has
clearly incentivized despots everywhere in the world to consider the
ultimate security which nuclear weapons provide. The North Koreans have
openly said that nuclear weapons ensure their post-9/11 regime security.
As distasteful as it may be to us, there is a logic to that. A small,
defensive-minded deterrent -- say five to ten warhead-tipped missiles
that could threaten limited retaliation against Southern cities -- would
be an objectively rational hedge against offensive action by the US or
South Korea. Indeed, this is almost certainly what Pyongyang says to
Beijing to defend its program to its unhappy patron. But this is the
absolute limit of responsible Northern nuclear deployment and probably
where the DPRK is right now. Further nuclear and missile development
would exceed even the most expansive definition of North Korean security
and takes us into the realm of nuclear blackmail, highly dangerous
proliferation, and an offensive first-strike capability. Pyongyang does
not need, for example, the ICBM it is supposedly working on. In this
context, my greatest fear for Korean security in the next two decades is
North Korean nuclearization continuing apace, generating dozens, perhaps
hundreds of missile and warheads, coupled to rising South Korean
paranoia and pressure to preemptively strike. There is no possible
national security rationale for Pyongyang to keep deploying beyond what
it has now, and if they do, expect South Korean planners to increasingly
consider preemptive airstrikes. North Korea with five or ten missiles
(some of which would fail or be destroyed in combat) is terrible
humanitarian threat, but not an existential one to South Korea (and
Japan). South Korea could ride out, perhaps, five urban strikes, and
Japan even more. But a North Korea with dozens of nuclear missiles,
possibly one hundred, some of them on submarines, would constitute a
state- and society-breaking, constitutional threat to South Korea and
Japan in case of conflict. That in turn will incentivize pre-emptive
airstrikes. [[**This spiral of paranoia** between North Korea
nuclearization, and pressure on Seoul (or even Tokyo) to **preemptively
defang North Korea** before it can **threaten state-destruction**, is
entirely predictable]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and the reason why
[[everyone]{.underline},]{.mark} even China and Russia, [[wants North
Korea to stop building]{.underline}]{.mark}. Let's hope they listen (but
they won't)."

It\'s winter, 2018, in Iowa, [[five months after the last of the nuclear
bombs detonated across megacities in northeast Asia,]{.mark} from Seoul
to Tokyo to Shanghai]{.underline}. Radioactive fallout was the initial
concern, but now something else is going awry: the weather. American
farmers accustomed to snow and cold during the winter would be forgiven
for mistaking their corn and wheat fields for the Arctic tundra, as
temperatures dip well below zero at night, and barely recover above 10
degrees Fahrenheit during the day, under a milky, leaden sky.
Forecasters say the corn and wheat harvest may be significantly
shortened this year, and for the next several years. In fact, [[fears
of]{.mark} a [**famine on an international scale** are settling
in]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This is what our world could look like just a
few months to years after a **regional nuclear war breaks out on the
Korean Peninsula** and **spreads to include China and possibly
Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**.** [Whether from]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[deliberate strategy or]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[terrifying
miscalculation, such a war could trigger a **global climate
catastrophe,** experts warn]{.underline},]{.mark} that is not being
factored into leaders\' planning. [[Such a war could cause the planet to
**cool by up to 10 degrees** Celsius, or 18 degrees
Fahrenheit,]{.underline}]{.mark} with larger regional swings and
extremes, [[according to]{.underline}]{.mark} Owen Brian
[[Toon]{.underline}]{.mark}, a [[scientist at the University of
Colorado]{.underline}]{.mark} at Boulder. The amount of cooling could be
far lower, depending on whether the conflict were more limited in scope.
Apocalyptic visions of a so-called global "nuclear winter" were popular
during the Cold War when envisioning a U.S. conflict with the
then-Soviet Union, but the **[[odds of a regional nuclear war in recent
times have jumped higher]{.underline}]{.mark}** after President Donald
Trump's bellicose rhetoric toward North Korea on Tuesday. Trump\'s
words, threatening to meet North Korea\'s threats with a \"fire and fury
like the world has never seen\" were the starkest warning of a nuclear
strike from any U.S. president in modern times. It\'s not just national
security experts who are horrified by Trump\'s words. Trump\'s rhetoric,
and history of openly considering using nuclear weapons, is also
concerning to climate scientists. Simulations in the 1980s, he said,
found that temperatures would plunge so far after a U.S.-Soviet nuclear
war that high temperatures in the summer temperatures would stay below
freezing worldwide. Two researchers, in particular, are taking note of
the North Korean threat: Alan [[Robock, of Rutgers]{.underline}]{.mark}
University, [[and Toon]{.underline}]{.mark}. Robock and Toon are modern
day Cassandras, having [[warned]{.underline}]{.mark} for decades
[[about]{.mark} the [**potentially ruinous climate change consequences**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a nuclear war, most [recently focusing on
[regional conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Robock has conducted much of
the research into the idea of a [[**nuclear winter**, whereby a global
thermonuclear war vaults so much smoke into the upper atmosphere to
block out the sun for years afterwards, causing temperatures to plunge
and **killing off vital crops**]{.underline}]{.mark} and [**[plant and
animal species]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Unlike the character from Greek
mythology, they don\'t make prophesies so much as publishing
peer-reviewed scientific studies. But, like the mythical character, few
have paid attention to their warnings. Right now, both [[Robock and Toon
are focused on]{.mark} the [**mounting tensions on the Korean
Peninsula**, where a nuclear-armed dictatorship threatens to strike the
U.S. or]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially
[[igniting]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[regional nuclear

[cou**ld seriously harm the homeland, by altering**]{.underline}
]{.mark}the [**[climate]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The modern-day nuclear
scenario that Robock, Toon and others have studied closely involves an
exchange of nuclear weapons between India and Pakistan, with about 50
bombs of 15 kilotons each, which is less than half of those nations\'
nuclear arsenals. A 2007 study published in the journal Atmospheric
Chemistry and Physics found that, if these weapons were aimed at the
center of large cities, the direct fatalities would be \"comparable to
all of those worldwide in World War II.\" Such a war would induce
massive firestorms in urban areas that could send up to 5 million tons
of smoke high into the upper atmosphere, where tiny particles known as
aerosols would scatter sunlight, preventing it from reaching the
Earth\'s surface. This would turn the planet\'s climate sharply colder,
despite the effects of human-caused global warming, and impact areas far
from the actual fighting. The global cooling from such a regional war
could be near 1.25 degrees Celsius, or 2.25 degrees Fahrenheit, studies
have shown. Once in the stratosphere, the particles contributed by the
smoke would stick around for a long time, Toon and Robock\'s simulations
show. Observations after volcanic eruptions and wildfires support the
model simulations. "It circles the globe and stays there for many
years,\" Toon said. Toon cites firestorms during World War II in
Hiroshima and Dresden, Germany, as real-world examples of what computer
model simulations show could occur from a nuclear war taking place in an
urban setting. And it\'s not just one computer model simulation that is
projecting a sharp global cool down and potential famine from a nuclear
conflict, Toon says. "This is something that has been confirmed now in
multiple climate models," Toon said, citing both U.S. and European
modeling studies. In an interview, Robock warned that a [[nuclear war on
other side of the Earth, "using much less than **one percent** of the
current nuclear arsenal,]{.underline}]{.mark}" or just .03 percent of
the explosive power of all the world\'s nuclear weapons in existence,
[[could produce "**a larger climate change than ever
recorded**]{.underline}]{.mark} before in human history." Not just a
regional issue Toon also said the central lesson of much of the research
into [[how the climate would respond to a limited nuclear war is not at
all comforting]{.underline}]{.mark}. "It really suggests that [[it would
be damaging]{.underline}]{.mark} for the world\'s climate [[to have
even]{.mark} a [small nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}, to the extent
that even if a major power like the US were to launch a nuclear attack
against another country," then [[the damage to agriculture and
ecosystems could "potentially lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[**nuclear
famine."** "**It would be suicidal**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" he said of
[[using even a limited number of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Robock said that an India-Pakistan nuclear scenario would cause such
severe climate change worldwide that agriculture in the main growing
regions of the U.S. and China would be reduced for more than a decade
afterwards. These two areas supply most of the grain that feeds the
world, and slashed production could lead to widespread famine. "That's
our shocking result that we've gotten so far," Robock said of his
research. A [[war between North Korea and the U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}.
would likely involve fewer nuclear weapons than India versus Pakistan,
which could limit the global environmental impacts. However, [[if it
draws in China and Russia, which both border North Korea, then **all
bets are off**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Robock says. [[North Korea is
thought to have]{.mark} anywhere [between 10 and 60 nuclear
weapons]{.mark}, not all of which are operational]{.underline}. However,
[[once started, nuclear wars can **spiral out of control**.]{.mark}
"]{.underline}Another issue is [[once a nuclear war would start it's
**really hard to control** it,"]{.underline}]{.mark} Robock said, noting
that [[China could be drawn in quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}. "So [[the
scenario could get **really horrible**]{.mark}."]{.underline} \"If they
used 10 weapons instead of 100 you might get one-tenth of the \[climate
change\] response\" when compared to India and Pakistan, Robock said.
Reached by email on Wednesday, Robock pointed to a statement from the
International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which calls
for the de-escalation of threats between the U.S. and North Korea, and
the abolishment of these weapons.

Alexander Nemets is a Russian researcher based in the United States who
specializes in Russian and Chinese developments in defense and military
reform as well as the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) In two
articles published online this week, Moscow analyst Aleksandr Nemets
details the evidence many have assembled showing that [[**Moscow is
heavily involved** in both the **rocket program** of **North Korea and
Pyongyang's "aggressive plans**" to use it against other
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} (see "Зато они 'делают' ракеты" and
"Системный подход"). It is absolutely essential, he says, that South
Korea, Japan and the United States understand that [[**everything that
is now brewing** in the region is what **Moscow**]{.mark}]{.underline}
or more precisely Putin [[wants" **and not some rogue action by Kim**
Jong Un]{.underline}]{.mark} as many imagine. In the first of these
articles, [[Nemets traces the history of Russian deliveries of missiles
to North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent decades and the ways in
which, apparently [[with some Russian assistance, Pyongyang has modified
them]{.underline},]{.mark} and then offers three main conclusions: First
of all, he says, "the development of the relatively primitive ballistic
rocket Hwasong-10, one that corresponds to the level of Soviet rockets
of the 1960s, from the beginning in 1992 until the series of tests in
2016, lasted 24 years." What the North Koreans came up with was "a copy
of the Soviet R-27 rocket." Soviet R-27 (SS-N-6 Serb) SLBM and North
Korean Hwasong-10 also known as BM-25 and Musudan In some ways, it was
not even as good, but it is important to note that the Hwasong-10 does
not contain anything original," a pattern that speaks to 'the low
scientific-technical potential of North Korea," Nemets argues. Second,
he continues, ["[even this primitive result would have been impossible
without **very intensive Russian assistance,** especially in
2015-2016]{.underline}]{.mark}. Why did Moscow feel compelled to provide
this? Obviously not for money ... Beyond any doubt, [**[Moscow's goal
was the infliction of maximum harm on America]{.mark}**.]{.underline}"
North Korean missile launch with Kin Jong Un watching And third, "the
Hwasong-12 ballistic rocket, which was successfully tested in May 2017
and which has a range of more than 4000 kilometers and is capable of
striking Guam and Alaska, is a much-improved version of the Hwasong-10,
although it is based fundamentally on the very same technologies." Taken
together, Nemets says, all this shows that "it is absolutely excluded
that the weak industrial and scientific-technical system of North Korea
could have created the Hwasong-12 in any case so quickly. If the Russian
share in the Hwasong-10 was conditionally more than 80 percent, then in
the case of the Hwasong-12, it approached 100 percent." In the second
article, the Moscow analyst broadens his focus in order to suggest that
[[the timing of North Korea's actions, its missile launches and
threats]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular, [[reflects less a Pyongyang
calendar than a Moscow one intended by Putin to do maximum harm to the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. Nemets argues
that [[**the North Korean actions happened precisely as Russian-American
relations were deteriorating,** when Moscow's expectations for a new
deal with]{.underline}]{.mark} Donald Trump [[were replaced by a
recognition that Washington was going to take a **hard line** against
Russia for]{.underline}]{.mark} its interference in American elections
and [[its **aggression in Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ukrainian
officials have pointed to these links, but their words have been
dismissed by many who believe that Kyiv is simply trying to blacken
Russia's reputation (and respond to Moscow's claims that North Korea's
missiles came from Ukrainian factories) in order to win more support
from the West, the Moscow analyst suggests. But now [[a Russian official
has implicitly made the **connection between Moscow's intentions and
Pyongyang's actions**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} Nemets says. Sergey
Ryabkov, Russia's representative to the United Nations, said that "the
government of the Russian federation had been forced to react to the
additional dislocation of (powerful) American THAAD complexes in South
Korea and Japan that are capable of intercepting ballistic rockets." Put
in more normal language, the Moscow analyst says, this shows that
"Moscow, infuriated by the fact that \[North Korea's\] neighbors don't
approve \[Pyongyang's\] nuclear and thermonuclear tests and the launch
of rockets flying over the territory of Japan, was simply forced to do
something."

If the rumors are true, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will visit
Russia in May during a commemoration of World War II in Moscow. Russian
Ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora also recently confirmed
that "Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin exchange messages on a regular
basis." On the surface it seems that [a [**revitalized Russian--North
Korean alliance** could be in the **offing**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
Observing this trend, many strategists have argued that Russia's
interests in North Korea are overwhelmingly economic, including a
transcontinental railroad and gas pipeline that would run through the
nation. But [[**Russia's dalliance with North
Korea**]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[fits a geopolitical pattern
reminiscent of the **Cold War's** early days: **Great power
competition** with the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[drives Russia's North Korea
strategy,]{.underline}]{.mark} and diplomatic niceties between these
former communist allies disguise Russia's true motivations. [[When
U**.S.--Russian relations are hostile and confrontational**, **Russia
moves closer** to North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}. During amicable
periods in U.S.--Russian relations, Moscow maintains a healthy distance
from Pyongyang[. [U.S. policymakers interested in imposing costs on
Russia for its expansionist behaviors by **sending arms to Ukraine**
must]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[recognize that Russia's geopolitical
chessboard is neither limited to the Ukrainian conflict, nor to
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} at large. Russia will not go to war to
defend North Korea in the face of military escalation, but [[if
U.S.--Russian relations remain]{.underline}]{.mark} on
[[hostile]{.mark}]{.underline} footing---which seems likely---[[**Russia
may return to its old Cold War tactics on the Korean Peninsula. Russia
can (and has) frustrated** the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[there before, and could **easily** do so
again]{.underline}]{.mark} in the wake of current economic sanctions.
VINTAGE POWER POLITICS In 1968 U.S.--Soviet relations were
confrontational, yet stable. By that time, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson
was several years into a strategy of building bridges to the Soviet
Union's Eastern European client states through economic and cultural
programs intending to sever Soviet influence. In January that year,
North Korean naval forces seized the USS Pueblo, a U.S. intelligence
collection vessel, along with its surviving 81-man crew. When Secretary
of State Dean Rusk approached his Soviet counterpart to request Soviet
mediation to resolve the crisis, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
rebuffed his request. When the United States brought the Pueblo's
seizure to the UN Security Council for action, the Soviet Union used its
veto power to block any resolution. And as the United States sent
military reinforcements into the Korean arena, including the USS
Enterprise Carrier Strike Group, the Soviet Union complicated matters by
responding with the mobilization of Soviet warships into the Sea of
Japan, compelling Johnson to withdraw the Enterprise. The United States
would eventually resolve the Pueblo crisis, but only after a year of
direct negotiations with North Korea in which it conceded to the demands
that Pyongyang had laid out at the beginning of the affair. Against the
backdrop of the Cold War rivalry, the Soviets seemed to take a certain
glee in U.S. frustrations with North Korea. By contrast, as U.S.--Soviet
relations started to thaw in the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union became a
crucial partner in U.S. policy toward the Korean Peninsula. North Korea
joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1985 only because the
Soviet Union, at the United States' request, pressured it to do so.
Following improved U.S.--Soviet relations in the late 1980s, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev began improving relations with South Korea,
eventually denouncing the Soviet Union's 1961 alliance treaty with the
North. By 1991, it was evident that North Korea was operating a
clandestine nuclear program, which pushed Russia to become a tacit ally
with the United States, even threatening to place its own sanctions on
North Korea if the nation did not cooperate with International Atomic
Energy Agency inspectors. During the George W. Bush administration, a
period when U.S.--Russian relations were steady and generally positive,
Russia played a constructive---if peripheral---role in the various
configurations of regional dialogue to denuclearize North Korea. As U.S.
and Russian interests increasingly diverged---from Russia's 2008 war
with Georgia to conflicts in Libya, Syria, and now Crimea---pragmatic
cooperation eventually gave way to strategic competition and renewed
rivalry. A NEW "GREAT GAME" U.S.--Russian relations are more hostile
today than at any time since the Cold War. The United States again finds
itself debating whether and how to confront Russian aggression, imposing
economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Crimea, and seeking to
reinvigorate NATO. A public debate has ensued about whether the United
States should send arms to Ukraine. U.S. defense intellectuals, and some
within the Obama administration, have become vocal advocates of this
option. It is within this context that Russia is suddenly expressing an
economic interest in North Korea, increasing political exchanges between
the two nations, and planning military exercises with the North for the
first time in decades. Yet again, great power dynamics are driving
Russian calculations on the Korean Peninsula. Russian strategy toward
Asia---and especially North Korea---is not predetermined but contingent
upon the country's larger relationship with the United States. Put
simply, [[the **Cold War rivalry** pattern has been **renewed:**
**Russian relations with North Korea are good because relations with the
U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[are
bad.]{.underline}]{.mark} Arguments suggesting Russia's current posture
toward North Korea is driven by economic incentives alone overlook this
pattern, as economic relations with North Korea have only flourished
during periods of U.S.--Russian hostility. At any rate, North Korea's
deadbeat debtor reputation, moribund economy, and low-skill labor
pool---to say nothing of political risk and horror stories of Chinese
investments gone awry---all cast a shadow of doubt on claims that
Russia's motivations in North Korea are purely economic. As the United
States invests time and political capital in isolating North Korea
internationally, Russian debt forgiveness, currency exchange, and trade
give Pyongyang a lifeline that alleviates international pressure. North
Korea has an interest in diversifying its external relations too, since
Beijing has started to grow weary of the nation's irresponsible
international behavior. Putin has extended an invitation to Kim Jong Un
to visit Russia and cancelled \$10 billion of North Korean debt, as the
logic of Russia's geopolitical rivalry with the United States demands.
As North Korea's conventional military capabilities have gradually
rusted away, [[**Russian military aid offers the prospect of
rejuvenation.** Russia may even see potential for North Korea to open up
a **new front of crisis or limited conflict** that draws U.S. attention
away from what it does on its European periphery]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Should the United States be concerned over a renewed Russian--North
Korean friendship? Yes and no. Russia's interests in Korea are purely
instrumental, and are not driven by Russia's insecurity or
ethno-historical claims to Crimea and other parts of its near abroad. We
should therefore expect a rational limit to Russia's willingness to
spend blood and treasure on North Korea. Even if Russia formally
rekindles an alliance with North Korea, which seems unlikely, Russia can
offer no credible extended deterrence because North Korea's significance
to Russia is mostly limited to being a thorn in the United States' side.
A Putin promise to fight the United States on behalf of the North would
be laughable under current circumstances. Still, [[**Russia does not
have to risk much** in order to play the role of **spoiler** in U.S.
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} toward Asia[, [of which North Korea is a
major part. Russia's position in
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} both geographically and
politically, [[provides it opportunities to oppose and even undermine
the region's precarious liberal order. On the Korean Peninsula, Russia
has a long history of **disruption** through economic aid, the provision
of **military arms**, and the training and deployment of]{.mark}
[foreign military forces]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout the Cold
War---minor costs if the result is a humbled, restrained adversary. [[As
U**.S. policymakers weigh whether to arm Ukraine**, Russian--North
Korean history urges them to judge the **benefits and risks** not simply
in terms of NATO, the European theater, or]{.mark}]{.underline} the
costs that Russia may pay in diplomatic and financial capital for its
actions in [[Crimea.]{.underline} [Russia's borders are not limited to
Europe, and neither are its **abilities to hamper U.S. interests**,
which are **arguably greater in Asia** than in Ukraine. Putin might be
using North Korea to **distract and stoke the ire** of
Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} but given the success of
this strategy in the past, it would be unwise to underestimate its
significance.

But [[military action against Tehran]{.underline}]{.mark} needn't be
anything like Iraq, Afghanistan, or Libya. There would be no pretense of
nation building or making the world safe for democracy. It [[would be a

that we have had enough. [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.mark}]{.underline} our [[allies

making clear to Iran that key parts of its **economy** and **political
identity**, including]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[shipping, refineries,
and nuclear facilities, would be **held at risk if it continued its
military aggression** or nuclear blackmail]{.mark}.]{.underline}
President Donald Trump warned Iran last month, tweeting "If Iran wants
to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the
United States again." Iran has responded with several attacks designed
to afford it minimal deniability, believing that America and our allies
will once again react with only words and minimal, purely defensive
gestures. It's time to follow through on our promises to react.
[[Either]{.mark} [we put]{.mark}]{.underline} the Islamic Republic of

[[encourage it to do what it has done since its birth---**wage war

[[Tensions between the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited

military confrontation** that carries a real possibility that the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will use
**nuclear weapons**. Iran's]{.underline}]{.mark} assortment of
[[asymmetrical capabilities---all constructed to be effective against
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates---[[**nearly assures** such a
confrontation. The current US nuclear posture
leaves]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration at least [[open to]{.mark} the [use of **tactical nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline} in conventional theaters. [[Some in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} current [[administration
may]{.underline}]{.mark} well [[think it to be in the best interest of
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates to [[seek
a quick and decisive victory in the oil hub of the Persian
Gulf]{.underline}]{.mark}---and to do so [[by using its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}. We believe [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark}
a [[heightened possibility of]{.mark} a **[US-Iran war triggering a US
nuclear strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the following reasons: The
sanction regime set against the Iranian economy is so brutal that it is
likely to force Iran to take an action that will require a US military
response. Unless the United States backs down from its present
self-declared "economic warfare" against Iran, this will likely escalate
to an open warfare between the two countries. In response to a White
House request to draw up an Iran war plan, the Pentagon proposed sending
120,000 soldiers to the Persian Gulf. This force would augment the
several thousands of troops already stationed in Iran's vicinity.
President Trump has also hinted that if need be, he will be sending "a
lot more" troops. [[Defeating Iran through conventional military means
would likely require a half million]{.mark}]{.underline} US [[forces
and]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[preparedness for many
casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}. The US nuclear posture review is worded
in such a way that the use of [[**tactical nuclear weapons** in
conventional theaters is envisaged, foreshadowing the concern that in a
showdown with a menacing foe like Iran, the **nuclear option** is **on
the**]{.mark} [**table.** The U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} once [again
[justify using nuclear force for]{.mark}]{.underline} the sake of [[a
decisive victory and casualty-prevention]{.underline},]{.mark} the
[[logic used in **Hiroshima and Nagasaki**]{.underline}.
[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} cavalier [[attitude toward nuclear
weapons]{.mark}, [trigger-happy penchant]{.mark}]{.underline}, and utter
disdain for Iran, [[show that he]{.underline} [would likely have
no]{.underline}]{.mark} moral [[qualm about issuing an order to launch a
**limited nuclear strike**, especially in a **US-Iran
showdown**,]{.mark}]{.underline} one [[in which the
oil]{.underline}]{.mark} transit [[from the Gulf would be imperiled,
**impacting the global economy** and necessitating a speedy end
to]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[a war]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the United
States were to commit a limited nuclear strike against Iran, it would
minimize risks to its forces in the region, defang the Iranian military,
divest the latter of preeminence in the Strait of Hormuz, and thus
reassert US power in the oil hub of the Persian Gulf. Oil flowing
through the Strait of Hormuz is critical to a rising China. US control
over this merchant waterway would grant the United States significant
leverage in negotiations. A limited US nuclear strike could cause a
'regime change' among Iranian leadership, representing a strategic
setback for Russia, in light of their recent foray in the Middle East
with Iranian backing. Undoubtedly, [[there are several significant
negative consequences to a US use of nuclear weapons, opening the way
for other **nuclear-armed states** to **emulate US behavior**, and for
many other **non-nuclear weapons states to seek their own nuclear
deterrent shields**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} There would also be a huge
outcry in the international community causing the US global image to
suffer. Will such anticipated consequences represent sufficient
obstacles to prevent a limited U.S. nuclear strike on Iran? With
President Trump, who counts on "bomb Iran" billionaire Sheldon Adelson
as one of his main campaign contributors, [[the **threshold for using
nukes** certainly seems to have been **lowered**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
How the United States and Iran came to the brink. President Donald Trump
complicates the situation by stating that the United States is not
seeking war with Iran, while repeatedly threatening to annihilate it. In
July of 2018, in response to a statement by Iran's President Hassan
Rouhani, Trump tweeted "NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR
YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY
HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE." On May 19, 2019, Trump fired another
incendiary volley, threatening the "official end" of Iran in a U.S.-Iran
war. Then Friday June 21, 2019 the day after Iran shot down a US
military drone, the President said "I'm not looking for war and if there
is, it'll be obliteration like you have never seen before. But I am not
looking to do that. But, you (Iran) can't have nuclear weapons." In an
interview with NBC's Chuck Todd. Citing Iran's military threat, the
Trump administration continues to enforce relentless economic sanctions
under the guise of a "maximum pressure" strategy, designating Iran's
revolutionary guard a terrorist organization. The administration also is
ramping up the US military presence in the Persian Gulf, sending several
warships, a Patriot missile battery, an expeditionary force of marines,
and nuclear-capable B-52 strategic bombers to the region. The United
States has also withdrawn all "non-emergency" personnel in Baghdad and
Erbil. These actions add fuel to the growing fear of war---a war sure to
involve Iraq, home to both US military bases and powerful
battle-hardened pro-Iran Shiite militias. War could break out in a
variety of ways: As a result of Iran's closure of the Strait of Hormuz
(a choke point for the daily transfer of some 19 million barrels of
oil), a preemptive strike on Iran's military and nuclear facilities (in
light of Iran's stated intention to resume aspects of its nuclear
activities, banned under the 2015 nuclear agreement), an application of
the 9/11 legislation on Authorization of Military Force against al-Qaeda
(accusing Iran of being in league with al-Qaeda terrorists), or in
response to perceived Iranian mischief (such as the recent sabotage on
board several Saudi and UAE merchant ships). The United States and Iran
are not the only regional players, and care must be taken to understand
the context and implications of events. As pointed out by a number of US
experts in the wake of the most recent attacks on oil tankers, regional
rivals such as Saudi Arabia have much to gain from a breakout of war
between the U.S. and Iran. The U.S. has echoed the Saudi accusations
against Iran and extended them to include blaming Iran for the Yemenis
Houthi rebels' drone attack on a Saudi pipeline on May 14th. Accusations
are one thing, but the big question is, will the Trump administration
heed Saudi Arabia's call for a "US surgical strike" on Iran? Both the
Saudis and Iranians harbor hegemonic ambitions in the region. The Saudis
are pushing for a limited US strike to eliminate some of Iran's
formidable naval and missile capabilities, thus weakening their regional
rival. But even a limited US strike would increase the likelihood of
Iranian forces inflicting serious damage on US military assets in the
region, both directly and indirectly through multiple proxy forces.
Iran's military commanders have warned that the US military fleet is
within range of Iran's short-range missiles. Iran has reportedly affixed
anti-ship missiles on hundreds of its fast boats, as part of an
asymmetrical "swarming" tactic. Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's Supreme
Leader, has also instructed the country's military forces to commence
preparations for war. It is worth recalling that Iran is ranked 14th for
countries with the most military firepower. Iran has also devoted
considerable attention to upgrading its asymmetrical capabilities,
including shifting its formal strategy to an "offensive-defensive"
posture---meaning that if the United States moves offensively against
Iran, Iran will counter by moving offensively against a regional target
of value for the United States. An example of an offensive-defensive
move would be if the United States were to use its airbases to launch
nuclear-capable B-52 strikes on Iran, Iran could counterattack the US
base in Qatar, irrespective of friendly ties with the country. Iran is
in many respects a "regional superpower" with over a half a million
active soldiers and another 350,000 reservists; it possesses thousands
of guided missiles, over 1,600 tanks, some 500 aircraft, hundreds of
military drones, and several surface warships, submarines, and mine
boats, in addition to some 3,000 fast boats. These assets indicate that
the now seemly imminent conflict with Iran will not be a cakewalk for
the United States. This [[possibility of a costly conventional
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} in our minds [[increases]{.mark} the
[likelihood of US **conflict escalation to nuclear war**. The risk of
nuclear warfare in the Persian Gulf represents a **present and clear
danger to world peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}, requiring the mobilization

Over the longer term, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[threats.
Because of its conventional military weakness compared to the US (and

**terrorism and cyber attacks** -- more often directed at American
allies]{.mark}]{.underline} than at the US itself -- [[to **create
problems for Washington**]{.underline}]{.mark} without creating a
pretext for a major US military response. [[We've already
seen]{.underline}]{.mark} that begin with [**[mysterious attacks on

**drone strikes by** Iran's **Houthi allies** on

attacks have the twin benefits for Iran of hurting]{.mark}]{.underline}
(and potentially humiliating) [[a key American ally

oil]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the past, [[the Iranians
have]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[mounted cyber-attacks on the computer
network of Saudi Aramco]{.mark},]{.underline} the company that controls
the Saudi oil network. [[If Iran continues]{.underline} [this pattern of
activity, the US and its allies will look for ways **to deter and
defeat** the Iranian attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}. At some point, [[the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} (or the Israelis, if they get dragged in, as
they often are) [[might decide to **respond with a military

they won't take a punch without throwing one in return. Again, there's
good reason to believe that that would be the end of it, but
[i[t's]{.mark} [not impossible]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[it might be
the start of something bigger]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We should also
remember that on occasion in the past, Iran has overstepped itself,
mounting terror attacks that could have (and should have) crossed
American red lines. In 1996, Iran blew up the Khobar Towers housing
complex in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 and injuring almost 400 American
military personnel. In 2011, Iran plotted to blow up a restaurant in
Washington, D.C. while the Saudi Ambassador was dining there. The attack
was foiled before it could be executed, but if brought to fruition, it
could have killed scores of people in America's capital. These were
[[**reckless Iranian moves** at times of **great tension** that could
easily have **triggered a US military response**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### U.S. interference with Russian-Ukraine relations affects Iran containment.

New Containment", March/April 2019, Foreign Affairs,
www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-02-12/new-containment)

The quarter century following the Cold War was the most peaceful in
modern history. The world's strongest powers did not fight one another
or even think much about doing so. They did not, on the whole, prepare
for war, anticipate war, or conduct negotiations and political maneuvers
with the prospect of war looming in the background. As U.S. global
military hegemony persisted, the possibility of developed nations
fighting one another seemed ever more remote. Then history began to
change course. In the last several years, three powers have launched
active efforts to revise security arrangements in their respective
regions.
[Russia](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2018-06-14/russia-it)
has invaded Crimea and other parts of Ukraine and has tried covertly to
destabilize European democracies.
[China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-02-13/china-reckoning)
has built artificial island fortresses in international waters, claimed
vast swaths of the western Pacific, and moved to organize Eurasia
economically in ways favorable to Beijing. And [the [Islamic Republic of
[Iran]{.mark}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-07-26/how-us-empowering-iran-yemen)
[has expanded]{.mark} its [influence over much of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria,
and Yemen and is pursuing nuclear weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} This new
world requires a new American foreign policy. Fortunately, the country's
own not-so-distant past can offer guidance. During the Cold War, the
United States chose to contain the Soviet Union, successfully deterring
its military aggression and limiting its political influence for
decades. The United States should apply containment once again, now to
Russia, China, and Iran. The contemporary world is similar enough to its
mid-twentieth-century predecessor to make that old strategy relevant but
different enough that it needs to be modified and updated. While success
is not guaranteed, a new [[containment]{.mark} policy [offers the best
chance to defend American interests]{.mark} in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}. Now as before, the possibility of armed conflict
exerts a major influence on the foreign policies of the United States
and countries throughout Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. [The Cold
War divided the world into rival camps, with regions and even countries
split in two. Today, similar cleavages are developing, with each
revisionist power seeking its own sphere of influence separate from the
larger U.S.-backed global order.]{.underline} Now as before, the
revisionist powers are dictatorships that challenge American values as
well as American interests. [They seek to overturn political, military,
and economic arrangements the United States helped establish long ago
and has supported ever since. Should [Vladimir
Putin's](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2018-06-14/peoples-authoritarian)
Russia succeed in reasserting control over parts of the former Soviet
Union,]{.underline} [[Xi
Jinping's]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-05-10/how-xi-jinping-views-world)
[China gain control over maritime commerce in the western Pacific, or
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's Iran dominate the oil reserves of the Persian
Gulf, the United States, its allies, and the global order they uphold
would suffer a major blow.]{.underline} The China-occupied Subi Reef in
the disputed South China Sea, April 2017 But today's circumstances
differ from those of the past in several important ways. During most of
the Cold War, Washington confronted a single powerful opponent, the
Soviet Union---the leader of the international communist movement. Now
it must cope with three separate adversaries, each largely independent
of the other two. [[Russia]{.mark} and China]{.underline} cooperate, but
they also compete with each other. And while [both have [\[has\] good
relations with Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}, both also have large and
potentially [restive Muslim
populations](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-06-20/reeducation-returns-china),
giving them reason to worry about the growth of Iranian power and
influence. Cold War containment was a single global undertaking,
implemented regionally. Contemporary containment will involve three
separate regional initiatives, implemented in coordination. The Soviet
Union, moreover, presented a strong ideological challenge, devoted as it
was to advancing not just Moscow's geopolitical interests but also its
communist principles. Neither Russia nor China has such a crusading
ideology today. Russia has abandoned communism completely, and China has
done so partially, retaining the notion of party supremacy but shedding
most of the economics and the messianic zeal. And although the Islamic
Republic represents a cause and not just a stretch of territory, the
potential appeal of its ideology is largely limited to the Muslim world
and, primarily, its Shiite minority. None of today's revisionist powers
possesses the Soviet Union's fearsome military capabilities. Russia is a
shrunken version of its older self militarily, and Iran lacks formidable
modern military forces. China's economic growth may ultimately allow it
to match the United States in all strategic dimensions and pose a true
peer threat, but to date, Beijing is concentrating on developing forces
to exclude the United States from the western Pacific, not to project
power globally. Moreover, the initiatives each has launched so
far---Russia's seizure of Crimea and Middle East meddling, [China's
island
building](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-06-05/vanishing-borders-south-china-sea),
Iran's regional subversion---have been limited probes rather than
all-out assaults on the existing order. The United States does not have
to deal with a single mortal threat from a country committed to remaking
the entire world in its own image. Lastly, the Soviet Union was largely
detached from the U.S.-centered global economy during the Cold War,
whereas today's revisionist powers are very much a part of it. Russia
and Iran have relatively small economies and export mostly energy, but
China has the world's second-largest economy, with deep, wide, and
growing connections to countries everywhere. Economic interdependence
will complicate containment. China, for example, may be a political and
military rival, but it is also a crucial economic partner. The United
States depends on China to finance its deficits. China depends on the
United States to buy its exports. Containment in Asia will thus require
other policies as well, because although a Chinese military collapse
would enhance Asian security, a Chinese economic collapse would bring
economic disaster. Together, these differences make today's containment
a less urgent challenge than its Cold War predecessor. The United States
does not have to deal with a single mortal threat from a country
committed to remaking the entire world in its own image. It must address
three serious but lesser challenges, mounted by countries seeking not
heaven on earth but greater regional power and autonomy. But if today's
challenges are less epic, they are far more complicated. The old
containment was simple, if not easy. The new containment will have to
blend a variety of policies, carefully coordinated with one another in
design and execution. This will tax the ingenuity and flexibility of the
United States and its allies. STRONGER TOGETHER As during the Cold War,
containment today requires American military deployments abroad. In
Europe, ground troops are needed to deter Russian aggression. **[The
[Putin]{.mark} regime has already [sent forces into]{.mark} Georgia and
[Ukraine]{.mark}. [The United States is committed to protecting
its]{.mark} NATO [allies]{.mark}. [These include the]{.mark} Baltic
states, tiny [countries on Russia's border]{.mark}. [By defending them,
the United States could encounter]{.mark} some of the same difficulties
it did defending West Berlin, including, in the worst case, having to
decide whether to bring [nuclear weapons]{.mark} into play rather than
accept military defeat]{.underline}.** East Asia requires a robust U.S.
naval presence to fend off China's campaign to dominate the western
Pacific. The United States is committed to protecting allies such as
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan and maintaining open sea-lanes, and it
conducts what it calls "freedom-of-navigation operations" in
international waters newly claimed by China to make clear that the rest
of the world does not accept Chinese claims and Chinese dominance there.
At the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, July 2018 And in the
Middle East, American naval and air forces are needed to safeguard
shipments of Persian Gulf oil to Europe and Asia and to support a
successful rollback of the [Iranian nuclear
program](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2019-01-11/year-living-dangerously-nuclear-weapons),
should that become necessary. American troops on the ground are not
required; it is local forces that must check Iranian efforts at regional
subversion (which are carried out by local militias). Diplomatically,
Washington needs to maintain or assemble broad coalitions of local
powers to oppose each revisionist challenge. In Europe, NATO was created
to carry out this very mission and so should be the pillar of the United
States' strategy there. In Asia and the Middle East, the "hub and spoke"
pattern of American Cold War alliances still exists, even as regional
powers have begun to collaborate among themselves. Working with partners
exploits Washington's greatest strength: its ability to attract allies
and create powerful coalitions against isolated opponents. Coordinating
with other countries also endows American foreign policy with a
legitimacy it would otherwise lack, showing that the United States is
not simply acting for itself but defending broad principles of
international order that many others support. Working with partners
exploits Washington's greatest strength: its ability to attract allies
and create powerful coalitions against isolated opponents. The
dependence of the revisionists on access to the global economy gives the
United States and its coalition partners a potential source of leverage.
Washington and its allies have tried to exploit this through sanctions
on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, tariffs on China for its trade
practices, and sanctions on Iran for its nuclear weapons program. But
interdependence cuts both ways. Russia has tried to pressure Ukraine by
restricting Ukrainian access to Russian energy. China has placed
targeted embargoes on Japan and Norway to express displeasure with
specific Japanese and Norwegian policies. Moreover, economic instruments
have at best a mixed record in achieving political goals; the broader
the sanctioning coalition is, the greater its impact will be. MAKING IT
OFFICIAL The prospect of a twenty-first-century triple containment
strategy raises several questions. Since the United States is already
doing much of what is required, how much change in American foreign
policy is needed? Is it necessary or feasible to confront all three
revisionist powers at once? And how does all this end? As for the first,
explicitly committing the United States to containment would build on
many existing policies while reframing them as part of a coherent
national strategy rather than the products of inertia or inattention. A
public commitment to containment would enhance the credibility of
American deterrence and lower the chance of opportunistic attacks by
opponents hoping for easy gains (as happened in Korea in 1950 and Iraq
in 1990). That, in turn, would reassure actual and potential allies and
increase their willingness to join the effort. Adopting containment as a
strategic frame would also help restrain Washington's occasional
impulses to do more (try to transform other societies) or less (retreat
from global engagement altogether). As for confronting all three at
once, geopolitical logic and historical experience suggest that reducing
the number of threats is the best course, as the United States did by
joining with the Soviet Union to defeat the Nazis and then aligning with
Mao Zedong's China to defeat the Soviet Union. Post-Soviet Russia would
have been a natural partner for the West. But Moscow was needlessly
alienated from its logical geopolitical partnership by NATO expansion,
which brought foreign armies to its doorstep over its objections. At
this point, all three revisionist regimes rely for domestic support on
nationalist hostility to the United States specifically and Western
democracies more generally and reject being part of a U.S.-led
coalition. Fortunately, Russia is much weaker than the Soviet Union,
China is restrained by both deterrence and the knowledge that military
conflict would damage its economy, and Iran is a regional power. So the
United States can afford to pursue the containment of all three
simultaneously (so long as it does so as part of robust coalitions).
STRINGER / REUTERS Russian sailors in Sevastopol, Crimea, February 2019
Cold War containment was an open-ended policy with a hoped-for eventual
outcome. The same will be true for the new version: the policy should
continue as long as the threats it is intended to counter continue, and
ideally it will end similarly. Constructive regime change, for example,
especially the advent of democracy, would alter the foreign policy
orientations of the revisionist powers. Such a change would have to come
about through internal processes and is unlikely to happen anytime soon.
Still, none of the regimes can be confident of its longevity; repeated
outbreaks of political turbulence over the years have shown that each
faces significant domestic opposition, maintains itself in power through
coercion, and fears its people rather than trusts them. Situations like
that can shift rapidly. A well-executed policy of containment could
increase the chances of disruption by creating an external context that
would encourage it. But when or, indeed, if it would bear fruit is
impossible to predict. BEWARE OF FREE RIDERS [[The biggest
obstacles]{.mark} to a new policy of containment [come]{.mark},
ironically, not from the powers being contained but [from the countries
doing the containing]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The United States
needs to relearn how to manage durable coalitions of allies and persuade
its own citizenry that the exercise of global leadership is still worth
the effort required. [[Coalitions are difficult to manage]{.mark} in the
best of circumstances]{.underline}. It was hard to hold the Western
alliance together during the Cold War, even though it faced a single
powerful threat. Building and maintaining comparable coalitions today,
confronted by diverse smaller threats, will be more difficult still. [In
Europe, although [all countries are wary of Russia]{.mark}, some are
more so than others]{.underline}. Those closest to Russia's borders most
strongly support an enhanced Western military presence. Years of crisis
over Europe's common currency, meanwhile, have taken a political toll,
increased intra-European tensions, and made cooperation of all kinds
more difficult. The continuing Brexit drama will only compound the
problems. Coalitions are difficult to manage in the best of
circumstances. In Asia, the Philippines and South Korea have sometimes
taken a more benign view of Chinese power than other countries in the
region. And among those agreeing on the need to check Chinese ambitions
(including Australia, India, Indonesia, and Japan), developing common
policies is difficult because they are an amorphous, heterogeneous group
In the Middle East, crucial American allies, such as Qatar (which hosts
a U.S. air base) and [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/opinion/saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman-trump-khashoggi.html),
are sharply at odds. The government of Turkey, a member of NATO,
identifies with the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt and Saudi Arabia
regard as a mortal enemy. Ironically, the one unproblematic member of
the anti-Iran coalition is Israel, a country that for decades was
anathematized as the root of all the problems in the Middle East but
that is now recognized as a dependable counterweight to Persian power.
All coalitions encounter [free-rider
problems](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2017-08-15/pay-europe),
and the dominant members usually pay more than their fair share of the
costs involved. So it will be with the new containment. The imbalance
will be most glaring in Europe, where a tradition of letting Washington
carry much of the burden of collective defense has persisted for too
long; it originated when U.S. allies were weak and poor but continued
even after they became strong and rich. During the Cold War, every
American president tried, without much success, to get European
countries to pay more for NATO, but none pushed the issue hard because
the priority was to maintain a common front against the Soviet threat.
There may be a lower tolerance for such free-riding today, as U.S.
President Donald Trump's comments make clear. The Asian countries wary
of China have increased their spending on defense. Still, the United
States is destined to take the lead in opposing China because the most
pressing threat the People's Republic presents is a maritime one---one
that requires major naval forces to contest, of the kind that only the
United States commands. In the Middle East, Israel has capable armed
forces. Saudi Arabia has purchased expensive military hardware from the
United States but has not demonstrated the capacity to use it
effectively. Turkey has a formidable military, but the present Turkish
government cannot be counted on to use it to contain Iran. WILL AMERICA
LEAD? The weakest link in the chain may be the most powerful country
itself. There are reasons to expect the American public to support a
leading role in the containment of Russia, China, and Iran. The United
States has a long history with such a foreign policy. The approach has
geopolitical logic behind it, promising to protect American interests in
crucial parts of the world at a reasonable price. But there are also
reasons for skepticism. Today's threats appear less urgent, coping with
them will be more complicated, and the country's attitude toward foreign
entanglements has understandably soured over the last two decades. The
weakest link in the chain may be the most powerful country itself. The
United States was pulled into both world wars by external attacks, and
Americans gave their support to a foreign policy of global reach during
the Cold War because they were persuaded it would head off yet another
world war. After the Soviet collapse, many of the Cold War arrangements
persisted through inertia and gained support because they seemed to
entail little expense or risk. Now that the expenses and risks of such a
policy have increased, many Americans may reconsider their support. The
skepticism has deepened because of the county's recent misadventures
abroad. The interventions in
[Afghanistan](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trumps-chance-to-bring-peace-to-afghanistan-and-end-americas-longest-war),
Iraq, and Libya turned out poorly, and the public has little taste for
more. This view has much to recommend it. But it need not threaten the
prospects of a new containment, because that course is quite different
from the failed crusades of recent decades. Those involved efforts to
transform the internal politics and economies of weak states.
Containment involves the opposite, checking the external conduct of
strong states. If national leaders can appreciate and explain the
difference, they may be able to bring the public along. The resurgence
of populism, finally, makes any such project more difficult. The essence
of populism is hostility to elites, and the design and conduct of
foreign policy are elite activities. The foreign policy establishment
favors a robust American role in the world. That may be a good enough
reason for antiestablishment rebels, including the populist in chief now
residing in the White House, to oppose one. So the future direction of
American foreign policy is unclear. Washington might forgo leading
coalitions to contain the three revisionist powers, in which case their
strength will increase. Emboldened by the American abdication, they may
grow aggressive and try to coerce their neighbors. Those neighbors
currently rely on the American nuclear arsenal to protect them; if they
come to doubt the credibility of American security guarantees, they may
follow Israel and opt to develop or acquire their own arsenals in order
to protect themselves. [An [American retreat would]{.mark} thus [make
the world more dangerous and nuclear proliferation more
likely]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thanks to the size, geography, and power of
the United States, Americans for many generations have been able to pay
less attention to American foreign policy than have the citizens of
other countries, whose lives and fortunes that policy has more
immediately and directly affected. Should the country turn decisively
away from its global role and allow the revisionist challenges to
advance unchecked, however, Americans' happy detachment from the world
beyond their borders may disappear. And by the time they realize what
they need to protect, it may be too late to do so without great
difficulty and high cost.

likely to make them less effective, potentially undermining the kind of

Iranian attack and could draw the entire Middle East into
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of all the Middle East conflicts, the [[war in
Yemen]{.mark} most sharply [pits Iran against Saudi
Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Iran's support has definitively shaped
Houthi military capabilities. In 2015, Saudi King Salman and his son and
defense minister, Mohammed bin Salman (who since June 2017 has also been
the crown prince), launched their first military venture to counter the
Houthis in Yemen. [Saudi Arabia sees Yemen as a defining point for

on Yemen. [[If at any point the war goes]{.mark} [beyond]{.mark} Yemeni
[proxies to a Saudi-Iranian confrontation, it is hard to see how the

[Amidst a wider war, Syria may deteriorate further into sectarian
conflict, and entrench Russia's dominant external role]{.underline}. The
irony in Yemen is that both Saudi Arabia and Iran can claim victory if
there is a ceasefire. Russia, the United States, Israel, Turkey, China
and the European Union would have every reason to work together to
achieve this goal. For the United States, now is the moment to
consolidate these foundations into an international coalition on Yemen,
pivoting from fighting Islamic State and chemical strikes in Syria, to
building a diplomatic initiative that gets regional antagonists to work
on a problem they can solve. But to succeed, Washington needs to keep
all the players at the table -- a challenge that will grow more
complicated with Trump's expected decision to withdraw from the Iran
nuclear agreement. Why would oil sanctions be harder to impose now than
in 2012? In 2012, the EU, China and Russia agreed that Iran's nuclear
program was a threat. Today, they believe that the nuclear agreement on
Iran -- the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- keeps Iran's nuclear
program in check. To bring [the nuclear
agreement](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/JCPOA-at-a-glance)
into force, among other actions, Iran had to reduce its uranium
stockpiles by 98 percent to under 300 kg (about 660 pounds) for 15
years, reduce its centrifuges from 20,000 to 6,104, cease uranium
enrichment at the underground [Fordow
facility](http://www.nti.org/learn/facilities/165/), and allow the
International Atomic Energy Agency continuous access for 15 years. As
recently as March 5, the IAEA certified that Iran is [meeting its
commitments.](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/iran/chronology-of-key-events)
Resuming sanctions on countries that import Iranian crude would violate
U.S. obligations under the JCPOA, potentially giving Iran an excuse to
rebuild its nuclear program. In sanctions 2.0, we should expect some
countries to comply minimally because they fear the penalties, not out
of conviction. For example, in 2012 the EU banned all Iranian imports,
but today we should expect the bloc to take advantage of a legislative
provision that would allow it to reduce Iranian oil imports in
increments of about 20 percent. China has concentrated all Iranian
petroleum transactions through already sanctioned entities, in effect
insulating itself from further sanctions, so expect China to bargain for
another 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) that others will not take. Both in
2011 and in 2017, Iran exported about 2.5 million bpd. At its peak, the
2012 sanctions [reduced Iran's oil
exports](http://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/The%20New%20Geopolitics%20of%20Energy_September%202015.pdf)
by 1.4 million bpd. For 2018, we might expect a net reduction of 300,000
bpd -- even assuming all countries besides China cut an unprecedented 25
percent. Over time these reductions would compound and hurt, but they
would not rattle Iran in 2018. On any given day, [[Yemen, Syria,
Hezbollah, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, the Kurds, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Israel, and
the United States are involved in armed conflicts in the Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}, and all could get worse. A [ceasefire in
Yemen is not a panacea but a starting point]{.underline} -- the one
place where virtually all actors could find a reason to call a ceasefire
a victory -- and where [diplomacy could [constrain Iran]{.mark} at least
in one part of the region.]{.underline}

#### Independent of checks, nuke war with Israel ensues.

**McGrath 19** ( journalist working on local, regional and national
newspapers for more than 25 years in various roles including reporter,
sub-editor and deputy editor (Ciaran, "Iran 'a significant threat to
Middle East peace', warns Israeli expert", 4 April 2019, Express,
<https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1109681/iran-israel-threat-middle-east-peace-hezbollah-hamas>)

[[IRAN's]{.mark} "significant" [threat to stability in the Middle East
should not be under-estimated]{.mark}]{.underline} - while
[[Israel's]{.mark} deep [commitment to "rolling back" the]{.mark}
Islamic [Republic's influence in Syria]{.mark}]{.underline} and
elsewhere mean tensions between the two countries are unlikely to recede
any time soon, an Israeli-based expert has said. And Brigadier general
Assaf Orion, of Israel-based think tank the Institute for National
Security Studies (INSS), has said Israel will face "serious choices" in
the future when it comes to containing the threat posed by militants
based in Gaza. [[Tensions between the]{.mark} two [nations threatened to
boil over]{.mark} last month [after a]{.mark} [[rocket attack]{.mark} on
Tel
Aviv](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1105055/israel-gaza-middle-east-missiles-war-benjamin-netanyahu-donald-trump-golan-heights)]{.underline}
resulted in the injury of seven people after it hit a house owned by
British-Israelis Robert and Susan Wolf. The attack, which was launched
from the Rafah area in Gaza [was later blamed on Hamas]{.underline}, and
[[Israeli's Prime Minister]{.mark} Benjamin Netanyahu [responded by
ordering a missile attack]{.mark} of its own on Hamas
positions]{.underline}. Brigadier general Assaf Orion The exchange is
the latest chapter in an increasingly tense stand-off, with Iran furious
at Mr Netanyahu's role in persuading US President Donald Trump to pull
the US out of the landmark Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action
([JPCOA](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1042645/donald-trump-news-iran-sanctions-world-war-3))
deal aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
[[Iran]{.mark} has [stepped up its rhetoric]{.mark} is recent
months,]{.underline} with senior military commander Yadollah Javani
saying his country would "raze Tel Aviv to the ground" if the United
States launched an attack, and Mr [[Netanyahu responding by warning Iran
not to "test Israel's resolve]{.mark}"]{.underline}. Mr Orion said:
"[Iran's obsession to 'wipe Israel from the map]{.underline}' needs
little introduction. "[[Iran]{.mark} is perceived as a threat as it both
[vowed to destroy Israel]{.mark} and is consistently devoting efforts to
promote this goal. "**[Its]{.mark} dual [strategy combines]{.mark} the
quest for [nuclear weapons]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a protracted and
indirect [proxy war]{.mark} against Israel**, in which the IRGC Quds
Force plays a central role."]{.underline} Israel has spent much of the
last four decades battling Iran's proxies such as the QUDs and
[Hezbollah](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1105631/donald-trump-israel-golan-heights-syria-Walid-Muallem-Benjamin-Netanyahu),
Mr Orion said. He added: "[[The most]{.mark} [serious]{.mark}
conventional [threat on Israel]{.mark} today [is from]{.mark} Lebanese
[Hezbullah]{.mark}, [an Iranian]{.mark} equipped, [armed, trained,
funded and inspired by Tehran]{.mark}]{.underline}, brandishing a rocket
and missile arsenal larger than many nation states. "The last years saw
[Iran trying to establish a similar capability in Syria and Israel
countering its attempts]{.underline}. "[The same method is applied
across the region, proliferating arms, rockets and military capabilities
into Iraq and Yemen, and with missiles falling on Riyadh it is no
coincidence that Saudi Arabia and other Arab states see Iran as their
worst enemy]{.underline}. "In a region ridden with many perils, [[Iran
is]{.mark} indeed [the most significant]{.mark} single [player of
instability, terror, subversion and arms
proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}." "As for the ongoing competition
between Iran and Israel in
[Syria](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1106364/world-war-3-latest-syria-israel-us-gaza-strip-iran-nairab-airport-missiles-rockets),
the former seeking military entrenchment there and the latter preventing
it, the last reports of a strike near Aleppo indicate that the game is
ON, that Israel does not limit its strikes to southern Syria, and the
Russia neither prevents Iran's military buildup in theatre nor Israel's
strikes against it." Mr Orion saw little prospect of an end to
hostilities in the near future, explaining: "In this long game Israel
rolled back much of Iran's military assets in Syria and set back its
plans by several years, but in a long strategic competition this is not
a final victory. "As long as
[Iran](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1108993/Iran-latest-news-cyber-attack-National-Cyber-Security-Centre-data-breach-uk-post-office)
can afford the blood and treasure expenses there, and as long as
Israel's costs in countering Iran are low, this is sustainable to both."
As such, he rated the chances of a land war between the two rivals, or
of Israel launching an invasion, as unlikely, saying: "This is far
fetched with over a thousand kilometres between Iran and Israel, and not
a common border. \"The two can strike each other across this distance,
but lacking large armies on each other's borders, they cannot invade
each other. "Israel lacks the will, the purpose and the size to do so,
and Iran may attempt this only by taking huge efforts and risks, which
were not demonstrated since the 1979 revolution." Mr Orion said US
President [Donald
Trump](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1105260/world-war-3-latest-news-us-israel-gaza-strip-palestine-donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu)'s
recent recognition of the Golan Heights as Israel territory had been
welcomed by Tel Aviv, explaining: "In the diplomatic sphere, it is good
for Israel to have the US on its side, but less so being quite isolated
in their common position. "Practically, most countries that vocally
rejected Trump's move at the principle and diplomatic level in fact
recognise Israel's security rights and de-facto control of the Golan
Heights. Several of them also live in their own glass houses, each with
its own special case (in northern Cyprus, Alexandretta, Crimea, Tunb
Islets, South China Sea, etc). "As for Gaza, we are a year into Hamas'
hybrid warfare fire-supported negotiations, generally failing to deliver
the economic gains it aimed for. "Gaza situation remains unstable, and
Israel's government will face serious policy choices in the near future,
both before the elections and after them."

### Baltic States Add-on

#### Russia will retaliate against U.S. arms sales to Ukraine by encroaching on the Baltic States. Empirics prove.

**Stratfor, '18** \["A U.S.-Ukraine Weapons Deal Has Russia Up in Arms;"
Stratfor Assessment, January 10, 2018;
https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/us-ukraine-weapons-deal-has-russia-arms\]

Moscow isn\'t convinced, though. [[Following the arms deal\'s
announcement, the Russian deputy foreign minister called the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates \"[[an
accomplice in fueling]{.mark} a [war]{.mark}]{.underline}\" because of
the decision. And [that accusation may not be the extent of Russia\'s
reaction. [Moscow,]{.mark}]{.underline} for example, [[could respond to
the move]{.mark} in kind [by ramping up its support for]{.mark} the
[separatists in Donbas]{.mark} to ensure they have capabilities on par
with]{.underline} those of [the Ukrainian military]{.underline}. On Jan.
10, a member of the Ukrainian parliament said the Russian military was
working on technology to shield vehicles from Javelin missiles. Beefing
up the separatists\' arsenal may be the best option for Russia to
respond to the U.S.-Ukraine lethal weapons deal without making relations
with the United States much worse. In addition, [[Moscow could opt for
an **asymmetric response**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Russia could
use]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**hybrid tactics it routinely employs**
against Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[including targeted
**assassinations**]{.mark}]{.underline} of security forces and
officials, **[[cyberattacks, economic restrictions, and political
manipulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- to put more pressure on the
country and its Western backers. [[It could]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[apply these methods **outside Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
instance in Syria or [[**in the European borderlands**, to retaliate
against the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [for increasing support to
the Ukrainian]{.mark} [government]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Russia,]{.underline}]{.mark} after all, [[has followed a similar
strategy many times in the past.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The greatest risk of U.S.-Russia nuclear war lies in a confrontation in the Baltics. U.S will threaten to use nuclear weapons to defend Baltic states.

### Baltic 1AC Advantage /2AC Add-on 2.0

####  (John Hollihan, Matthew Sung)

#### U.S. arms sales to Ukraine anger Russian officials---fuels risk of war.

**Wilkinson 17**, (Tracy Wilkinson, foreign affairs correspondent for
*Los Angeles Times*, "U.S. decision to provide anti-tank missiles to
Ukraine angers Russian leaders", *Los Angeles Times*, 26 December 2017,
(https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-us-ukraine-20171226-story.html)

President [[Trump's]{.mark} long-delayed [decision to provide Ukraine
with]{.mark} defensive lethal w[eapons signaled a new **willingness to
oppose** Russian intervention]{.mark} in its neighbor]{.underline}, [but
has made European allies nervous that a recent hike in fighting could
escalate]{.underline}. The [State Department said Friday that [the
administration would supply the government in Kiev with Javelin
anti-tank missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} to destroy armored vehicles used
by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and to raise the cost
of Russia's intervention in the conflict. The Trump administration said
earlier in the week that it also would permit sales of some small arms
to Ukraine from U.S. manufacturers. Ukraine long had sought the portable
infrared-guided Javelins to blunt the insurgents' advances. But some
U.S. officials worried that providing the weapons could provoke the
Kremlin to step up its military role and ruin any chance of easing
tensions with Moscow. Kurt Volker, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine,
recently warned that the deadliest fighting since February had erupted
in eastern Ukraine. More than 10,000 people have been killed since
mid-2014, when Russian military forces seized the Crimean peninsula and
began supporting armed separatists in eastern Ukraine against the
government in Kiev. Both the Pentagon and State Department had
recommended supplying the anti-tank missiles earlier this year.
Officials in both Washington and Kiev stressed that the anti-tank
missiles are defensive in nature. \"American weapons in the hands of
Ukrainian soldiers are not for offensive \[use\], but for stronger
rebuff of the aggressor \[and\] protection of Ukrainian soldiers and
civilians," Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said on Facebook. "It
is also a trans-Atlantic vaccination against the Russian virus of
aggression.\" Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, appeared
to downplay the move. \"U.S. assistance is entirely defensive in nature,
and as we have always said, Ukraine is a sovereign country and has a
right to defend itself,\" she said. [[Russia]{.mark}, which has
officially denied supporting the insurgents in eastern Ukraine, [called
the U.S. decision **"dangerous"** and]{.mark} said Washington was acting
as **["an accomplice in fueling a war."]{.mark}** [Sergei Ryabkov,
Russia's deputy foreign secretary]{.mark}, also [blamed]{.mark} what he
called anti-Russian ["Russophobia" in Washington for the decision to arm
what Moscow portrays as fascist Ukrainian
nationalists]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"U.S. weapons are capable of leading
to new casualties in our neighboring country, and we cannot remain
indifferent to that,\" Ryabkov said. German Chancellor Angela [Merkel
and]{.underline} French President Emmanuel [Macron did not overtly
criticize the U.S. decision, but urged all combatants to abide by the
much-violated 2015 ceasefire]{.underline} deal known as the Minsk
Agreements. France and Germany brokered the agreement, which called for
withdrawal of heavy weapons from frontline positions, as well as safe
delivery of humanitarian aid and the exchange of prisoners. "There is no
alternative to an exclusively peaceful soslution to the conflict,\"
Merkel and Macron said in a joint statement. Congress approved \$500
million in aid to Ukraine this year, but some congressional leaders,
including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, urged the administration to also provide lethal
weapons.

#### Sustained U.S. arms sales destroys any peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.

**DePetris** **18**, (Daniel is a fellow at Defense Priorities, and a
columnist for the Washington Examiner, "Why the U.S. shouldn't send arms
to Ukraine," 12 March 2019, *Reuters*,

//mesung\--ncp)

The National Security Council is reported to be on the verge of
recommending the export of \$47 million worth of defensive arms to
Ukraine. The package will reportedly include a cache of Javelin
anti-tank missiles, weapons that would reliably and efficiently disable
the hundreds of tanks that the Russian-supported separatists in the
country's east have acquired since the conflict began. To advocates who
believe that sending weapons to the Ukrainian government will bloody
Russia's nose and send President Vladimir Putin a message, this pending
decision couldn't have come soon enough. Arming Kiev is a popular
prescription supported by top military officers and many lawmakers in
both parties. [While it may be uncomfortable to admit, the political
orientation of Ukraine and how Ukrainians choose to manage (or
mismanage) their economy and political system doesn't directly affect
the United States]{.underline}. As Rajan Menon and William Ruger wrote
in Foreign Affairs magazine last month[, ["Ukraine matters more to
Russia than it does to the United States."]{.underline}]{.mark} To
Washington, Ukraine is a post-Soviet state whose oligarchic politics and
systemic corruption have severely handicapped the country's economic
outlook. [U.S. security interests in Europe are not wedded to whether
Kiev succeeds in establishing a more democratic and accountable form of
government. At best, [Ukraine is a peripheral country that the United
States doesn't have a treaty obligation to defend if its territory is
invaded.]{.mark}]{.underline} To Putin, however, Ukraine is an integral
puzzle in his grand strategy of making Russia as relevant a global
player as it was during the Cold War. A wholesale Westernization of
Ukrainian politics, from associations with the European Union (EU) to a
possible membership in NATO, would destroy that ambition and ruin a
significant portion of Putin's political legacy. Indeed, the possibility
of Ukraine increasing its trade relationship and political direction
with the United States and Europe was enough of a national security
threat to Putin that he was willing to deploy Russian soldiers,
paratroopers, and special forces on Ukrainian territory to carve out a
zone of influence there. Putin's belief that a Russian-friendly Ukraine
is a national security imperative for Moscow won't be changed by a
couple dozen anti-tank missiles from the United States. [The second
[concern for the Trump administration is how **Putin might respond to
any escalation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As former National Security
Council official Charles Kupchan argued in the Washington Post: "The
notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin would give up his hold on
Donbass \[Eastern Ukraine\] if a few more Russians come home in body
bags is to dramatically misread the Kremlin." Yet this false assumption
is what undergirds the arguments from proponents of lethal assistance to
the Ukrainians. It's impossible to understand why some U.S. legislators
are so confident that Moscow will react in the way they expect. The
three-and-a-half year long war has shown that Russia is ruthless in
escalating its involvement and investment in the conflict to prevent a
military victory for Kiev. [In fact, [to expect that Moscow would
respond to more Russian casualties by suing for]{.mark} a [peace]{.mark}
settlement [is to ignore]{.mark} completely [how Putin has
behaved]{.mark} since Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine. When separatist
units in Donetsk and Luhansk were losing ground to pro-Kiev forces early
in the war, Russia came to their rescue.]{.underline} In the summer of
2014, when pro-Ukrainian troops were retaking towns that Kiev previously
lost, columns of Russian tanks, artillery, heavy weapons, and soldiers
crossed the border into Ukraine to ensure that there were no more
Ukrainian territorial advances in strategic areas. When the stalemated
battle in the city of Ilovaisk was slowly moving Kiev's way,
conventional Russian soldiers and weapons were fast-tracked to the
frontline in what would turn out to be one of the deadliest days for
Ukrainian troops in the war. [Months later, when the separatists were in
jeopardy of retreating from the strategic town of Delbatseve, Russian
tanks were deployed and quickly forced an undermanned, disorganized,
demoralized, and tired contingent of Kiev forces to
withdraw.]{.underline} There's no reason to think that Putin would
respond less violently now if Washington sent defense shipments to
Ukraine. [The most negative impact of [additional U.S.
involvement]{.mark} is that it [will likely spoil Moscow's willingness
to cooperate on a Ukrainian peacekeeping proposal]{.mark}.]{.underline}
While Moscow has insisted that the 2014 and 2015 Minsk protocols are the
only way the war in Ukraine can end peacefully, Putin has openly
acknowledged that there may need to be greater international involvement
if that peace is to be sustainable. He broached the subject of deploying
U.N. troops along the contact line this September and even agreed to
explore greater access to peacekeepers in separatist-controlled
territory after a call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The concept
is now being discussed within the Trump administration and between the
U.S. and Russian special envoys to the conflict, suggesting sincerity on
the Russian side. A White House authorization to send equipment to Kiev
could stop that dialogue. It's difficult to understand why the United
States would escalate the war when there may finally be an opening to
explore a U.N.-enforced cessation of hostilities that could lead to a
political settlement to the conflict. [[The Russians could respond to
increased U.S. involvement in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in other ways
too. Moscow could, for example, use its veto power in the U.N. Security
Council to block U.S.-led efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear program.
Putin could expand military and intelligence cooperation with Iran to
undermine the Trump administration's policy of containing Iranian
expansionism. The costs to the U.S. of turning Ukraine into a proxy war
against Russia overshadow the benefit of increasing Moscow's casualty
count. [[Sending arms to Kiev will do **very little** to help resolve
the conflict. Sometimes the best course of action for the White House is
not to get more involved on issues peripheral to American grand
strategy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Absent peace talks, Russia convinces themselves they need a new target in the Baltic states

**Shlapak 18**, (David, senior defense researcher at RAND; professor at
Pardee RAND Graduate School (B.A. in political science, Northwestern
University), "The Russian Challenge", RAND Corporation, 2018,
(<https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE200/PE250/RAND_PE250.pdf>)

Paradoxically, in some unforeseen future circumstances, [the [Russian
leadership could]{.mark} also convince themselves that they were in the
opposite position---that an opportunity existed to [inflict a
catastrophic defeat on the **threatening NATO**]{.mark} [alliance by
crushing its underprepared defenders in the Baltic
states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Taking advantage of this opportunity would
demonstrate via a shattering tactical vic- tory NATO's strategic
inability to fulfill its primary, foundational mission: guaranteeing the
territorial integrity and political indepen- dence of its member states.
In so doing, [Russia would seek to divide the alliance to the point of
dissolving it, break the transatlantic security link, and reestablish
itself as the dominant power in East- ern and Central
Europe]{.underline}. Although this strategy appears alien to current
Russian thinking, [the chance of inflicting such a devastat- ing
strategic blow on its longtime nemesis---and nearly three [years of RAND
wargaming and analysis strongly indicate that Russia could impose just
such a defeat on NATO's eastern flank in the space of **tens of
hours**]{.mark}---]{.underline}could, one fateful day, be seen in Moscow
as justifying the profound attendant risks.4 However, [the key thing to
recognize here is that [it is]{.mark} the consequences of [failing to
deter a Russian attack that make this a compelling problem]{.mark}, not
necessarily its raw likelihood]{.underline}. [[Russia is the only
country in the world that maintains the capability to destroy the United
States]{.mark}---[and]{.mark}, not incidentally, [its European
allies---as a functioning society]{.mark}]{.underline}, and any war with
Moscow necessarily entails a risk of nuclear escalation that would
endanger U.S. national sur- vival. Absent something approaching absolute
certainty that Russia would never, under any circumstances, attack any
NATO member state---a degree of confidence that seems almost impossible
to plau- sibly attain---the enormous costs and risks associated with a
war make prudent hedging against the possibility seem a wise invest-
ment. It is an insurance policy against a catastrophic disaster. A
decade ago, few would have argued that such insurance was necessary to
deter Russia. However, [[Moscow has]{.mark} now demonstrated [a
willingness to operate outside the boundaries of the accepted security
order, including by using force to permanently alter]{.mark} inter-
national [borders]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has engaged in cross-border
aggression on three separate occasions, issued numerous verbal threats
against NATO and member states, and, importantly, is carrying out a
program of military modernization that, among other things, renders it
more capable of committing both unconventional and conventional attacks
against its neighbors.5 The risk has increased to the point where it can
no longer be ignored.

#### Russian attacks on Baltic States would be quick and efficient -- they're easy targets and NATO forces fail.

**Gilmour 18**, (Jeff, writer for Journal of Military and Strategic
Studies, "Kaliningrad and the Baltic Countries -- A Russian Threat to
NATO?", Journal of Military and Strategic Studies, Volume 19, Issue 1,
24 October 2018, (<https://jmss.org/article/view/58349/43880>)

Given Russia's demonstrated proclivity for unilateral intervention,
[Baltic states and NATO members Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia2
remain]{.underline} understandably [concerned regarding the **recent
build-up** of Russian military forces along their Eastern
borders]{.underline}. [Analysts argue that [Russian forces could
**deploy quickly** in the Baltic region]{.mark} and could use an
artificially created domestic crisis (i.e. disenfranchisement of Russian
diaspora in those countries),]{.underline} similar to that used in the
Ukraine, to show that NATO is unable to respond effectively, or not at
all, to a threat posed by Russian troops and a significant naval Baltic
Fleet. 1 Eight countries in the UN recognize the Republic of Crimea and
Sevastopol as federal subjects of Russian. When the Soviet Union broke
up in 1991, Crimea became part of the independent Ukraine. 2 These
states joined NATO in 2004. A report from the [Rand Corporation, a US
think-tank, contends that [Russia could **overrun** the Baltic States if
it wanted to in **36 hours**]{.mark}.]{.underline}3 In its damming
report, it said [NATO's military assets in the Baltic countries were so
**mismatched** with Russia as to be inviting a devastating war, rather
than deterring it."]{.underline} 4 [[Rand]{.mark} said it [carried
out]{.mark} a series of [war games exploring a scenario in which
Russia]{.mark} tried to [annex the capitals]{.mark} of either Estonia,
Latvia or both, similarly how it seized the peninsula of Crimea. The
[outcome was "bluntly a disaster for NATO]{.mark}, the report found,
[with every play through of events ending with Russian forces in or at
the **gates of Tallinn and Riga within 60 hours.**]{.mark}"]{.underline}
Russia outnumbered NATO ground battalions by almost two to one and
possessed much heavier weaponry. The report concluded that NATO could
not successfully defend the territory of its most exposed members. A
defense analyst has written: much has been written about the defense of
the Baltic States since 2014; [most of it pessimistic about NATO's
ability to defend the Baltic States should the need ever
arise]{.underline}. Few discussions get as far as actually considering
war termination because the [[prospect of **immediate defeat** in the
Baltic is so great]{.underline}]{.mark} and the challenges of forcefully
re-entering the theatre of operations from Western Europe and across
Scandinavia are so vast and formidable that thinking past them seems too
far ahead. 5 A 2018 report also from the Rand Corporation again
confirmed that [[NATO would be overwhelmed by]{.mark} superior [Russian
firepower in]{.mark} the event of a [war in Eastern
Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline}6 If war were to break out, the report
warns, Russia could quickly overrun the Baltic region and use
"brinkmanship to attempt to freeze the conflict." The authors of the
report recommend that the growth of Russian military capability must be
met with "a more robust posture designed to considerably raise the cost
of military adventurism against one or more NATO member states." 7 The
report goes on to state that the past 15 years NATO forces have been
shifting their focus away from high-intensity, combined3 A. Withmail,

counter-insurgency operations in distant locations such as Afghanistan,
Iraq and Mali. [[Although NATO has deployed four multinational
battalion-size battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland on
a rotational basis, it is likely not enough]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
1,100 plus soldiers in the Latvian battle group are led by 450
Canadians; in Estonia it's Britain, in Lithuania it is the Germans and
in Poland it is the US. The Rand report also says [[NATO has around
32,000 troops in the Baltics; compared with Russia's
78,000]{.underline}]{.mark}.8 [[NATO is also **outnumbered 757 to 129 in
tanks**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The conclusion states that: Russia has
retained a combined-arms force that emphasises mobility and firepower
and trains to conduct larger-scale combined-arms operations. This gives
Russian forces an important advantage in conflicts between mechanized
forces close to the border. Russia can now field modernized weapons,
improvements to readiness and experience gained in large-scale exercises
and can rely on combat operations based in the Ukraine and Syria.
Russia's improved logistical network allows it to mass significant
forces within its borders. Russian firepower and home advantage means it
could overrun and secure the Baltic region before the US and its allies
have a chance to strike back by which time the war could already have
been won -- and not by NATO. 9 As a result of such ominous predictions
by military analysts, on 2 May 2018, Estonia began the largest military
exercise since regaining its independence in 1991.10 The exercise
featured 15,000 service members from ten NATO countries and lasted 12
days. Estonia has already increased its' defense spending to reach the
two percent.

#### NATO-Russian offensive in the Baltic States leads to cyber warfare and nuclear escalation

**Kyle 18**, Joe Kyle, a graduate student in the Security Policy Studies
program in the Elliott School of International Affairs at the George
Washington University, with a dual focus on Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and
Russia; "Contextualizing Russia and the Baltic States", *Orbis*, Volume
63, Issue 1, Decmeber 2018
(<https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438718300991?via%3Dihub>)

[[A Russian offensive would most likely feature the following
elements]{.mark}: The offense would [occur along Russia\'s
border]{.mark}]{.underline} where it has a numerical advantage and could
bring overwhelming firepower to bear. Small numbers of elite forces
reinforced by armored vehicles would strike quickly, disrupt, and
overwhelm adversaries before they could mount an effective response.
A2/AD capabilities within Russian and mobile vehicles would provide
indirect and direct fire support. This support would supplement tactical
maneuvering by ground forces with the goal of boxing in and destroy an
enemy force.56 [[Asymmetric tactics, such as information and cyber
warfare, would be used to further disrupt infrastructure, increase
confusion and uncertainty]{.mark},]{.underline} sway public opinion, and
erode resolve.57 Against a peer opponent like NATO, it is likely
"Russian operations would feature a swift coup de main and then
transition to defense and consolidation of gains."58 The greatest fear
of the governments in Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius is that Russian forces
would seize and annex part of their territory.59 Ethnic Russian majority
areas like Ida-Viru in Estonia and Latgale in Latvia present targets of
opportunity to Russia. Such a situation could present fait accompli for
NATO. The [[Baltic states fear that a]{.mark} swift and successful
[occupation of]{.mark} parts of [their countries by Russia might lead
NATO to]{.mark} consider [a counteroffensive too costly in blood or
presenting too dangerous a risk of escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}.60
Also, once Russia has annexed this territory, Moscow could construe any
counteroffensive or "liberation" by NATO forces as an invasion of
sovereign Russian territory and begin ascension of the escalation
ladder.61 [[The risk of nuclear escalation would force leaders in
Brussels to choose between triggering Article V or ceding the captured
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}. If this were the case, a policy of
"actual occupation and formal nonrecognition" similar to the Cold War
might emerge. The trip-wire effect of the multinational battalions
reassures the governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania that any
invasion of their territory is an attack on all of NATO, and it "would
help minimize the pressure within the alliance to simply cede to Russia
any territory it may take, thus strengthening deterrence and preventing
deliberate Russian escalation."62

#### Crossing the threshold of nuclear escalation disrupts international norms -- causes extinction

Nickolas **Roth** & Matthew **Bunn**, **'17** (Nickolas, research
associate at the Belfer Center's Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard
University, Matthew professor of practice at the Harvard Kennedy School,
9/28/17, "The effects of a single terrorist nuclear bomb",
<https://thebulletin.org/2017/09/the-effects-of-a-single-terrorist-nuclear-bomb/>)

And [what standards of **international order** and law would still
hold]{.underline} sway? [[The country attacked might]{.mark} well
**[lash out militarily]{.mark}**]{.underline} at whatever countries it
thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A terrifying
description of the kinds of discussions that might occur appeared in
Brian Jenkins' book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) [[With the nuclear
threshold]{.mark} already [crossed]{.mark}]{.underline} in this
scenario---at least by terrorists---it [is conceivable that some of the
resulting [conflicts]{.mark} might **[escalate to nuclear
use.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [International politics could
become]{.underline} more **[brutish]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[violent,]{.underline}** [with powerful states taking unilateral
action]{.underline}, [by force]{.underline} if necessary, in an effort
to ensure their security. [After 9/11, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [led the invasions of
two sovereign nations]{.underline}, in wars that have since cost
hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, while plunging
a region into chaos. [Would the reaction after a far more devastating
nuclear attack be any less?]{.underline} In particular, the idea that
each state can decide for itself how much security to provide for
nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients would likely be seen as
totally unacceptable following such an attack. [Powerful states would
likely demand]{.underline} that [others surrender their nuclear material
or accept foreign troops]{.underline} (or other imposed security
measures) to guard it. [That could well be the first step toward a more
**profound transformation of the international system**]{.underline}.
After such a catastrophe, [[major powers may feel compelled to]{.mark}
more freely [engage in **preventive war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, seizing
territories they worry might otherwise be terrorist safe havens, and
taking other steps they see as brutal but necessary to preserve their
security. For this reason, [foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has
argued]{.underline} that ["conventional [rules of sovereignty **would be
abandoned overnight**]{.mark}."]{.underline} [[Confidence
in]{.underline}]{.mark} both the national security institutions of the
country attacked and [[international institutions]{.mark} such
as]{.underline} the [International Atomic Energy Agency and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[N]{.underline}**ations, which had so
manifestly failed to prevent the devastation, [might
[erode]{.mark}]{.underline}. The effect on nuclear weapons policies is
hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror driving a new push
for nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine states feeling more
certain than ever before that they needed nuclear weapons.

### EXT: Baltic States Add-on Impacts

#### Miscalculation risks U.S.-Russia nuclear war in the Baltics.

Fifth, [[any counter-attack by NATO in the Baltics could **easily be
misconstrued** by Moscow as a threat to its core
interests]{.mark},]{.underline} in part [[because]{.mark}]{.underline}
some [[strikes against attacking forces would occur on Russian
territory, and]{.underline}]{.mark} in part [because [Russia\'s fragile
reconnaissance system would quickly be overwhelmed by the fog of
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Anthony [Barrett of the RAND
Corporation]{.underline} has recently [produced a worrisome analysis
detailing how [an East-West conventional conflict along the Russian
periphery could **escalate to nuclear-weapons use through**]{.mark}
**[miscues or misjudgments]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### U.S. and Russian military doctrines justify nuclear war in the Baltics.

**Thompson, '16** \[Loren is Chief Operating Officer of the non-profit

https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-baltic-states-are-where-nuclear-war-most-likely-17044\]

Sixth, [[both sides in a]{.underline}]{.mark}ny such [[conflict would
have **military doctrine potentially justifying** the use of **nuclear
weapons** to prevent defeat]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the case of
[[Russia]{.underline},]{.mark} it [[has stated repeatedly that it needs
non-strategic nuclear weapons to cope with]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[superiority of NATO conventional forces]{.mark}, that [it would **use
such weapons in order to protect** its **core assets and values**,
and]{.mark} even that [nuclear weapons might]{.mark}]{.underline}
sometimes [[be useful]{.mark} tools [for de-escalating a conflict.
Successive U.S. administrations have stressed that **nuclear weapons
underpin alliance commitments.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Nearby nuclear weapons increase risk of U.S. Russia nuclear war in the Baltics.

**Thompson, '16** \[Loren is Chief Operating Officer of the non-profit

https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-baltic-states-are-where-nuclear-war-most-likely-17044\]

Seventh, [[both sides have non-strategic **nuclear weapons in theater
ready for quick use**]{.underline}]{.mark} if tactical circumstances
dictate. For example, Hans [[Kristensen noted the presence of several
**nuclear-capable military systems** in the Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad located between Lithuania and Poland.
Although]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Russians]{.mark} [have not disclosed
whether nuclear warheads are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[located in the
district,]{.underline} [there is little doubt that **hundreds could
quickly be deployed** to areas around the Baltic states in an
**escalating conflict**]{.underline}. [**Nuclear-capable NATO jets**
could **reach the area within hours**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Overall, the risk if U.S.-Russia nuclear war in the Baltics is high. Misunderstanding raises the stakes.

The bottom line is that [[**all the ingredients** are present in the
eastern Baltic area for an East-West conflict **escalating to nuclear
weapons use**]{.mark}. [Neither side understands what actions might
provoke nuclear use by the other, and once war began both sides would
likely have a tenuous grasp of what was
happening]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The [[high stakes assigned to
the outcome of]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[a conflict and]{.underline}
[the ready availability of \"non-strategic\" nuclear weapons in a
context where either side might view their use as
strategic]{.underline}]{.mark} in consequences [[is a **prescription for
catastrophe.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

### EXT: Solvency

#### U.S. should ban lethal arms sales to Ukraine and substitute only non-lethal transfers.

**Chrzanowski, '18** \[Brendan, Navy veteran and a student in the NYU
Global Affairs graduate program; "Arming Ukraine: Practicalities and
Implications;" Real Clear Defense, September 5, 2018;
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/09/05/arming_ukraine_practicalities_and_implications_113769.html\]

First and foremost, [[the **U.S. must transition from the provision of
lethal means, to non-lethal aid** paired with an advisory presence
focused on countering Russian electronic warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}
capabilities. Next, [[**in lieu of any further weapons deals,** Congress
should author and pass a bill that allocates increased funds to be used
in providing Ukraine with non-lethal materiel, surveillance drones,
and,]{.underline}]{.mark} most importantly, [[counter-electronic warfare
technology.]{.mark}]{.underline} Finally, Congress should petition the
president to authorize not only the aforementioned equipment-provision
bill, but also the deployment of additional troops, with a non-combat
mandate, to assist the Ukrainian military with training and structural
reforms.

### Risks of Lethal Arms Sales to Ukraine Vastly Outweigh Benefits

#### Significant risks of lethal arms sales to Ukraine outweigh their benefits. Absent lethal weapons, non-lethal aid will suffice.

**Murskyj et. al., '16** \[Mykola, Belfer International and Global
Affairs Student Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government,
where he is completing his Master's in Public Policy in international
affairs. He is a managing editor of the Kennedy School Review; "U.S.
Policy on Ukraine: Challenges and Opportunities;" 2016;
https://razomforukraine.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/US-Policy-on-Ukraine_Challenges-and-Opportunities.pdf\]

In the end, [the [arguments against arming Ukraine are **stronger,**
from the point of view of]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[Ukraine
and]{.underline} [the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. First, [[providing lethal weapons runs
the **risk of inflaming a simmering conflict and igniting a proxy war**
between the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a region to which both Donald
Trump and Vladimir Putin have signaled it is the latter who has the
stronger commitment. Second, [[the **current level of strategic depth is
preserved** if the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [**[focuses on financial, political, and
technical aid]{.underline}**,]{.mark} keeping the option of arming
Ukraine open, and hinting that the option becomes more likely if Russia
escalates the conflict. Third, [[**lethal defensive weapons are not the
only way to increase the costs of a Russian military escalation**. Other
options include helping the Ukrainian armed forces prepare
fortifications and erect anti-tank barriers]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Finally, note that from the point of view of the Ukrainian electorate,
it is important that their elected officials continue asking for lethal
aid from the United States. Thus it is difficult to tell whether
Ukrainian elites truly believe lethal aid will help. For these reasons,
it may indeed be better for the U.S. to maintain its policy of not
sending lethal weapons to Ukraine, although the option should certainly
be kept open. Keeping the option on the table acts as a restraint
against further Russian aggression, since Russia fears that if it were
to escalate the fighting, the United States could respond by sending
arms to Ukraine. Providing lethal aid to Ukraine should be strongly
considered in the event of a Russian escalation in Ukraine.

### AT: Other Countries Will Circumvent/Fill-In

#### U.S. lethal weapons sales send a key signal to other nations to begin selling arms to Ukraine. U.S. action will be followed by allies.

**Marzalik and Toler, '18** \[Peter, project assistant at the Atlantic
Council's Eurasia Center; Aric, lead digital researcher for Eurasia at
the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab; "Lethal Weapons to
Ukraine: A Primer;" Atlantic Council, January 26, 2018;
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/lethal-weapons-to-ukraine-a-primer\]

[[The long-awaited shift in US policy toward providing state-to-state
lethal defense aid is an **important signal**]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} both **[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
adversaries [[that enhanced support is]{.underline}]{.mark} necessary
and [[justified for Ukraine. The move will likely **compel European
allies**,]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly in the East, **[[to
reassess]{.underline}]{.mark}** any [[**restrictions on lethal arms to
Ukraine**. **More liberal or streamlined export licensing, such as
evidenced by Canada and the Czech Republic, appears to be a common first
step** toward potentially more robust security commitments to
Ukraine]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Other nations' sales to Ukraine don't currently involve lethal weapons.

**EA Daily, '17** \["Royal pain: The West strengthens Ukraine's army let
alone lethal weapons;" EA Daily, November 15, 2017;
https://eadaily.com/en/news/2017/11/15/royal-pain-the-west-strengthens-ukraines-army-let-alone-lethal-weapons\]

The United States, [[Great Britain, and Poland significantly increased
the sale of weapons to Ukraine. Basically, **we are talking not about
lethal weapons**, but]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[military
electronics]{.underline}]{.mark}. As experts say, such assistance from
the West strengthens Ukraine\'s fighting capability and the position of
supporters of military revenge in the Donbass.

#### 3. Only U.S arms sales are key:

#### A. Only U.S. sales cause Russian responsive escalation to another nuclear power, leading to more conventional war and nuclear escalation.

#### B. Only U.S. sales provide Russia with means and motive to strike back against it elsewhere-North Korea, Iran and Baltics.

#### C. Only U.S. sales make the United States complicit with human rights violations. 

#### 4. No other country can fill the void- US sales are make-or-break.

[[While it's true]{.mark} that [Russia and China
are]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed [major [exporters]{.mark}]{.underline}
of armaments, [[the claim that U.S. weapons can]{.mark} easily [be
replaced]{.mark}]{.underline} by other suppliers [[is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} -- at least not in the short term.¶ First,
[[once a country is "locked in" to a specific]{.underline}]{.mark} kind
of [[weapons system]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as planes, tanks or naval
vessels, [the cost to switch]{.underline} to a different supplier [can
be huge. [Military personnel must be retrained]{.mark}]{.underline} on
new equipment, [[spare parts need to be replaced, and operational
changes may be necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ [After being so reliant
on U.S. weapons systems for decades, **[the transition costs
]{.mark}**]{.underline}to buy from another country **[[could be
prohibitive even for oil-rich Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}**.¶ The
second problem with Trump's argument is that [[armaments from Russia,
China or elsewhere are simply not as sophisticated as U.S.
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is why they are usually cheaper --
though the quality gap is quickly decreasing. To maintain its military
superiority in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase
virtually all of its weapons from American and European companies.¶
[That is why [the U.S. has significant leverage]{.mark}]{.underline} in
this aspect of the relationship. [Any Saudi threat to]{.underline}
retaliate against a ban on U.S. arms sales by [buy]{.underline}ing
[weapons from countries that have not raised concerns]{.underline} about
the Khashoggi disappearance [would not be credible]{.underline}. And is
probably why, despite worries in the White House, such a threat has not
yet been made.

### AT: U.S. Will Give Rather than Sell Arms to Ukraine (circumvention)

#### Trump demands Ukraine pay for lethal arms rather than get "free stuff." He won't merely give arms to Ukraine.

in Washington, DC, formerly reporter for Foreign Policy; "How Russia
Hawks Are Selling Trump On Sending Weapons To Ukraine;" Buzzfeed News,

But US officials tell BuzzFeed News that they have a pitch they believe
can win the president's approval of providing \$40-50 million in arms to
the war-torn country, including powerful Javelin anti-tank missiles.
Officials said the president could be presented with the proposal in the
coming weeks. [[The **key to**]{.mark} **[persuading
Trump]{.mark}**,]{.underline} officials said, [[is **requiring Ukraine
to pay** for]{.underline}]{.mark} at least some of [[the
equipment]{.underline}]{.mark} and casting the arms package as a step
toward "peace" in the three-year conflict between Kiev and
Russian-backed separatists. BuzzFeed News could not independently
confirm the GDP figure cited by the State Department official. But
Oleksandr Turchynov, a top Ukrainian defense official, said in August
that Kiev plans to spend at least 5% of its GDP on defense, more than
double what NATO recommends its member states contribute to their
defense budget[. [Requiring Ukraine to pay for the arms package is not
an ideal situation for cash-strapped Kiev,]{.mark}]{.underline} which
has allies on Capitol Hill who are more than willing to foot the bill.
In September, the US Congress authorized \$500 million for security
assistance to Ukraine, including the provision of weapons. But one
individual familiar with the deliberations said [[Ukrainian
President]{.underline}]{.mark} Petro [[Poroshenko is in part responsible
for sparking Trump's interest in a **transactional
agreement**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Poroshenko was the victim of his own
rhetoric," said the person. "[[He\'s told Trump on several occasions how
strong a partner Ukraine is, with a growing economy and defense
spending. So **Trump is like, 'what do the American people get out of
this deal?**'" "**For Trump, it has to be a two-way
deal,"**]{.underline}]{.mark} [a senior State Department official told
BuzzFeed News]{.underline}. "[[Ukraine spends almost 7% of its GDP on
defense, so **it's reasonable to expect Ukraine to pay** for
this."]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Trump demands that arms transfers to Ukraine will be sales not gifts. He won't give something for nothing.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[completed its shipment of Javelin anti-tank
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} to Ukraine on Monday, [[finalizing a
**sale**]{.mark} that was]{.underline} reluctantly [[approved
by]{.underline}]{.mark} President Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} in
November. The deal was widely reported as a rebuke to Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014.
"This decision ... reflects our country's longstanding commitment to
Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression," Republican Senator
Bob Corker said late last year. But the terms of the arrangement show it
may be more bark than bite. The weapons "have been delivered to a secure
facility in Ukraine, not on the line of conflict," Kurt Volker, the U.S.
Special Representative for Ukraine, told me. He did not elaborate
further, but The Wall Street Journal reported in January that the
weapons would be stored in training centers in western Ukraine that will
be monitored by American soldiers. But the terms of the arrangement show

"no one is tougher on Russia" than him. But his critics have accused him
of challenging Putin only superficially. Shortly after the Trump
administration expelled 60 Russian diplomats in March---48 of whom were
actually intelligence officers, according to a State Department
spokesperson---the State Department acknowledged that the Kremlin would
be allowed to refill the vacated positions. The Treasury Department
recently sanctioned more than three dozen Russian oligarchs, officials,
and entities who "profit" from Russia's "malign activity" and "corrupt
system." But many of the sanctioned oligarchs had four months' notice to
move their money, thanks to a list of Russia's wealthiest individuals
released by the Treasury in January. That money might already be back in
Russia. "As they say, 'a barking dog cannot hinder a caravan's
journey,'" Putin told Russia's TASS news agency at the time. He mocked
his own absence from the list. When UN Ambassador Nikki Haley announced
new sanctions against Russia over its support for embattled Syrian
dictator Bashar al-Assad, she was contradicted by the White House hours
later. "There is confusion about the Putin-Trump relationship," Major
General Volodymyr Havrylov, Ukraine's defense attaché to the U.S., told
me last month. "And an element of unpredictability. But we believe in
checks and balances in the United States." Former National-Security
Adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed for Trump
to approve the lethal weapons sale to Ukraine, according to Havyrlov and
another U.S. official familiar with the deal who requested anonymity to
discuss it freely. Trump was convinced, at least in part, by the fact
that President Barack Obama---to whom Trump frequently compares
himself---had balked at the sale. The official relayed a conversation
between Trump and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko last year in
which Trump asked why Obama had "done nothing when Russia invaded
Crimea." (Obama sanctioned Russia over the incursion in 2014.) [[Trump,
ever transactional,]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[wanted to make sure he
was **not giving away something for nothing**]{.underline}. [The U.S.
official said]{.underline} ]{.mark}it was emphasized [to the president
that [this would be a **sale, not a gift**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
Poroshenko won favor with Trump by facilitating an \$80 million coal
deal---the first between the U.S. and Ukraine---that was politically
expedient for both leaders. In February, Ukrainian Railways signed a \$1
billion locomotive deal with GE Transportation. Trump had promised
during the campaign to revitalize the U.S. rail industry. "The Trump
administration is very much focused on jobs creation," said Daniel
Vajdich, the president of the strategic advisory firm Yorktown
Solutions. "So, naturally, Ukraine has thought about its ability to help
create jobs for Americans in the context of creating leverage by feeding
into Trump's policy desires." A Ukrainian-American lobbyist who spoke to
me on condition of anonymity put it more bluntly: "Poroshenko has become
a hostage of Trump," he told me.

## Topicality

### Sales v. Grants Topicality 

#### We meet: U.S. lethal arms transfers to Ukraine are actual sales rather than direct government to government grants.

veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, is The Daily Signal's foreign

Canada also recently announced it will issue licenses to its defense
contractors to sell weapons to Ukraine. [[Like the Canadian decision,
the one announced by the U.S]{.underline}.]{.mark} this week [[is **not
a direct shipment of weapons to Ukraine from the U.S. government.**
Rather, it is the **issuance of a State Department license to a U.S.
commercial manufacturer to sell weapons to
Ukraine**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### 2. We meet: Plan explicitly reduces only foreign military and direct sales, not grants or gifts of arms.

#### 3. Topicality is not a voter:

#### A. Competing interpretations are bad- it creates a race to the bottom, is infinitely regressive and justifies "Counter interpretation: only our case is topical."

#### B. Good is good enough -- reasonability is key to check unpredictable neg definitions and checks the neg block bias, and there's no objective way to reconcile competing interpretations.

Additionally, Berube assumes that we have pure and direct knowledge of
the meanings of a text. However, in order to understand the meanings of
a text we must interpret that text. When advocates speak, we inevitably
interpret what they say. Meanings are found in the act of
interpretation, and those [[meanings]{.underline}
[differ]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least slightly, [[between
interpretations. There is virtually no text in a debate that can inspire
one universally agreed upon interpretation]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
listeners and readers, we can never find ourselves at a point where the
intentional, naive, and rogate meanings of a text are objectively
transparent to us. Determining what questions a text invites requires
interpreting the text, and these [[interpretations will vary, producing
contrary readings of what questions may be asked of that
text.]{.underline} [There is no way to reconcile interpretations
objectively]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} In order to evaluate
competing interpretations, one would have to engage in precisely the
critical textual analysis Berube attempts to foreclose. Since every
interaction with a text is interpretive, Berube\'s objective standard
for encountering a text never can be met.

#### C. Potential abuse is not a voter- it's infinitely regressive and leads to judge intervention. Make them prove in round abuse.

### AT: Substantially

#### We meet: Plan text on face substantially reduces U.S. arms sales to Ukraine.

#### Counter Interpretation:

#### Substantial means considerable in amount without specifying a precise number of cut-off point.

**Prost 4** (Judge -- United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, "Committee For Fairly Traded Venezuelan Cement v. United
States", 6-18,
<http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/04opinions/04-1016.html>)

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of
§ 1677(4)(C).  In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach. 
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that no "precise mathematical
formula" or "'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a dumping
concentration analysis.  SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also Venez.
Cement, 279 F. Supp. 2d at 1329-30.  Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis."  SAA at 860.  Finally, [the definition of the word
"substantial" undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC's [argument.  The word
["substantial" generally means "considerable]{.mark} in
amount,]{.underline} value or worth."  Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 2280 (1993).  [**[It does not]{.mark} [imply a specific
number]{.mark} [or cut-off]{.mark}**.  [What may be substantial in one
situation may not be in another]{.mark} situation.]{.underline}  The
very breadth of the term "substantial" undercuts the CFTVC's argument
that Congress spoke clearly in establishing a standard for the
Commission's regional antidumping and countervailing duty analyses.  It
therefore supports the conclusion that the Commission is owed deference
in its interpretation of "substantial proportion."  The Commission
clearly embarked on its analysis having been given considerable leeway
to interpret a particularly broad term.

#### We meet: U.S. arms sales to Ukraine are increasingly substantial.

studies at the Cato Institute; "Washington Quietly Increases Lethal

Secretary of Defense James Mattis acknowledges that U.S. instructors are
training Ukrainian military units at a base in western Ukraine.
Washington also has approved two important arms sales to Kiev's ground
forces in just the past nine months. [The first transaction in December
2017 was limited to small arms that at least could be portrayed as
purely defensive weapons. That agreement included the export of Model
M107A1 Sniper Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories,
a sale valued at \$41.5 million. [A transaction in]{.mark} April [2018
was more serious. Not only was it larger (\$47 million), it included
**far more lethal weaponry**, particularly 210 Javelin anti-tank
missiles]{.mark}---the kind of weapons that Barack Obama's
administration had declined to give Kiev]{.underline}. Needless to say,
the Kremlin was not pleased about either sale. **[Moreover,
[Congress]{.mark} soon [passed legislation]{.mark} in May [that
authorized \$250 million in military assistance, including lethal
weaponry, to Ukraine in 2019]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [Congress
had twice voted for military support on a similar scale during the last
years of Obama's administration, but the White House blocked
implementation. The Trump administration cleared that obstacle out of
the way in December 2017 at the same time that it approved the initial
small-weapons sale. The [passage]{.mark} of the May 2018 legislation
[means that the path is now]{.mark}]{.underline} [[open for a **dramatic
escalation of U.S. military backing** for Kiev.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Counter standards:

####  1. Predictable Limits -- negative over limits, destroying core affirmative ground. Ukraine arms sales are a predictable case based on amount of sales and geo-strategic importance of Europe's borderlands with Russia.

####  2. Education-negative interpretation limits out all country-specific affirmatives, preventing consideration of real- world flashpoints such as Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, South Korea and Israel.

### AT: Arms Five Categories

#### We meet: Plan text on face substantially reduces only lethal arms sales to Ukraine. All lethal arms sales fit into one of the five categories which define arms.

#### Counter-interpretation:

#### Their own source includes items encompassing categories a "wide range of goods and services" beyond the so-called five categories. Even the narrow definition in the CBO study goes further than those categories and is limited to a single study irrelevant to the debate context. Finally, the proper definition should include "arms transfers," which is closer to the resolutional context than only defining "arms" out of context.

Accessed 06-12-2019, p. 79)

**[Definition of the Term \"Arms Transfers"]{.underline}**

[[ACDA defines **arms transfers** as \"weapons of war, parts thereof,
ammunition, support equipment, and other commodities designed for
military use.\" ACDA]{.mark} thus [includes **a wide range of goods and
services**: military construction, royalties from tech]{.mark}nology
[licenses]{.mark} when they are part of the transfer agreement, [and **a
host of smaller or ancillary equipment**]{.mark} such as [nonarmored
military vehicles]{.mark}, communications and electronic equipment,
[small arms, ammunition]{.mark}, parachutes, and uniforms]{.underline}.
The ACDA data treat U.S. exports differently than those of the rest of
the world. ACDA excludes construction and other services from the U.S.
export level. It also leaves out dual-use equipment for U.S. exports
unless it is included on the Munitions List, but counts such items for
the rest of the world. (The value of the dual-use equipment is difficult
to gauge, but the foreign military construction sales and \"other
services\" reported by the Department of Defense averaged over \$3
billion a year in the late 1980s---more than 10 percent of the figure
ACD,A reports for total U.S. exports.) [[Which definition]{.mark} of
arms [is most appropriate? **The answer depends on the issue**]{.mark}
at hand. [The limits in this study use **a narrow definition**]{.mark}
**of weapons** [but **are also intended to comprise dual-use and
component trade** that can contribute to the manufacturing of such major
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. The economic analyses, however, are based
on CBO estimates of what might happen to all military production.

#### We meet: Plan includes any lethal sales both within the context of the five categories plus a wider range of ancillary equipment like small arms and ammunition which define arms transfers.

#### Counter standards:

####  1. Predictable Limits -- negative over limits, destroying core affirmative ground. Ukraine arms sales are a predictable case based on amount of sales and geo-strategic importance of Europe's borderlands with Russia.

####  2. Education-negative interpretation limits out all smaller arms sales affirmatives, preventing consideration of real- world issues such as use of small arms and ammunition to violate human rights and conduct important infantry ground operations and invasions.

### AT: Effects T -- General 

#### 1. We meet - we directly substantially reduce Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of lethal weapons from the United States to Ukraine.

#### 

#### 2. Effects Topicality is legit:

#### a. Political Education -- most political events do not occur in isolation -- they are the result of a chain reaction of events.

#### c. Neg Link Ground -- Extra steps generate extra ground for offense.

#### d. No abuse - They still get links to decreases in restrictions on legal immigration, because we increase it.

#### e. Their claim is vague -- anything could be portrayed as effectually topical. There are many steps involved in all legislation.

#### 3. Not a voting issue:

#### a. The main intent of the plan is clearly to substantially reduce Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of lethal weapons from the United States to Ukraine.

#### b. It's not the same as non-topicality. Our plan text is centered on the resolution and results in complete, topical action.

#### c. Mixing burdens is inevitable. You don't make us prove that our plan is passed or implemented -- fiat takes care of that. The steps our plan requires should be included in this, as well -- they have no bright line or reason why they shouldn't.

### AT: Extra T -- General 

#### 1. Not extra-topical -- all of plan action falls within the scope of the resolution.

#### 2. Extra-T is legit:

#### A. Aff ground -- mechanisms like funding and enforcement, which aren't articulated in the resolution, are essential.

#### B. Neg ground -- for every link we might prevent we open dozens more. They're predictable because they're still within the scope of substantially reducing arms sales, and hence, described in the lit.

#### C. Counter-interpretation -- at least one plank must be completely topical, and all planks must be part of a unified whole.

#### i. Education -- we learn about what external issues affect the resolution - you can't analyze complex ideas in a vacuum.

#### ii. Mandating that at least one plank be topical keeps the other issues that we bring up within this realm of education.

#### D. Not a Voter -- we don't claim advantages from the extra-topical portion.

#### E. Not a Voter -- just remove the extra-topical portions and then judge the plan. This is justified by the necessity for some extra-topical funding and enforcement, and the lack of bright line between that and so-called abusive sections. We need the "no-risk" plank.

#### i. It's not severance because we're giving them the power to force us, theoretically to remove planks, not removing them ourselves.

#### ii. Severance would be justified in this case alone by the above offense.

#### Russian military aid to separatists will offset any strategic benefit of U.S arms sales to Ukraine.

**Savitsky, '18** \[Arkady, military analyst with the Strategic Culture
Foundation; "US Supplies Ukraine with Lethal Weapons to Escalate
Conflict and Bury Hopes for Peace;" Strategic Culture Foundation, May 3,

[[Every move has consequences. **Russia can easily supply** the
self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine with the Kornet anti-tank
system]{.mark},]{.underline} which is [**[militarily superior to the
Javelin]{.underline}**. [The Russian weapon has proven]{.underline}
]{.mark}itself [[effective on the battlefield]{.mark}]{.underline} even
[[against state-of--the-art tanks]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the
Israeli Merkava IV. [[Moscow can supply the republics with weapons and
electronic warfare systems in **greater quantities**]{.underline}
f]{.mark}or the simple reason that [[it]{.underline} [does not have to
ship that equipment across the Atlantic Ocean and]{.underline}]{.mark}
all of [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[now that the US has crossed
the red line, Russia's hands are now free]{.underline}.]{.mark} In
theory [[Russia could recognize the republics as independent states,
once the Minsk]{.underline}]{.mark} II [[accords have been forgotten and
war preparations]{.mark}]{.underline} are [[in full
gear]{.underline}]{.mark}. If their governments invite Russian forces
in, in order to guarantee their own security, Moscow will act strictly
in accordance with international law by agreeing to those requests. The
[[**Javelins will not change anything.** Those weapons systems are **not
powerful enough** to give Ukrainian troops the **crucial advantage**
they will need to ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[victory]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But [[the move will certainly
**inflame tensions**, making the lives of]{.mark}]{.underline} ordinary
[[Ukrainians worse]{.underline}]{.mark}, not better. They need political
and economic reforms, not new weapons. The last thing Europeans want is
the resumption of war in Ukraine. But the weapons are there. The
warnings have been ignored and there is no turning back. The
[[**repercussions** will be **destructive**]{.mark}.]{.underline} From
this moment forward Washington must bear the responsibility for whatever
goes wrong.

#### Turn: Lethal weapon sales to Ukraine will be counterproductive. Russia will double its efforts to support the separatists.

**Depetris, '17** \[Daniel, fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington
think tank; "Russia Will Retaliate After U.S. Supplies Lethal Weapons to
Ukraine;" Breaking Defense, December 28, 2017;
https://breakingdefense.com/2017/12/russia-will-retaliate-after-u-s-supplies-lethal-weapons-to-ukraine/\]

[[Proponents]{.underline}]{.mark} of this recommendation
[[argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the bloodier Russia's nose becomes
and the higher the death toll for Russian soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}
on the battlefield, [[the more pressure Putin will be under to cut ties
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the outgunned and outmanned
[[separatists.]{.underline}]{.mark} The prevailing logic, however, is
based on a hopeful theory of how they hope Putin will respond.
[[Moscow's conduct over the three-and-a-half years of combat]{.mark} in
Eastern Ukraine,]{.underline} however, [[should lead to the **exact
opposite conclusion**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- when push comes to shove,
[the [Russians have proven to be willing to **withstand** the financial,
political, and military pain associated with preventing]{.mark} the
**[total military defeat of anti-Kiev forces]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Russian officials have, predictably, denounced President Trump's
authorization of lethal equipment to the Ukrainians --- including the
likely delivery of Javelin anti-tank weapons, which could pulverize
Russian armor--- as an aggressive act meant to deliberately sabotage the
Minsk peace process. While there is a possibility that Ukrainian forces
could use U.S.-supplied heavy weapons in an offensive capacity as the
Russians suggest, it is more likely that [[this assistance will be used
by Moscow as an excuse to **redouble its own support to Ukrainian
proxies**]{.mark} in Donetsk and Luhansk.]{.underline}

### EXT: Arms Sales Allow Ukraine to Defeat Separatists/Russians

#### U.S. arms sales will never convince Russia to back down over Ukraine. Putin will up the ante in response.

**Depetris, '17** \[Daniel, fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington

Ukraine;" Breaking Defense, December 28, 2017;
https://breakingdefense.com/2017/12/russia-will-retaliate-after-u-s-supplies-lethal-weapons-to-ukraine/\]

In other words, [[whenever pro-Russian militants were losing ground or
at risk, Moscow turned on the spigot of assistance to prevent a
humiliating defeat or retreat]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is one of the
biggest reminders to the world community that [[Ukraine's political
disposition is **ultimately far more important** to Russia's strategic
interests than it is to Washington's]{.underline}. [**No amount of U.S.
military equipment or heavy weapons systems** **is likely to eclipse
what the Russians will provide**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the other side.
[[To believe Russia will be intimidated into withdrawing its
troops]{.mark}]{.underline} from Ukrainian territory [[or suing for a
peace]{.underline}]{.mark} with a government Moscow sees as a puppet of
the West just because a few more of its soldiers have been killed [[is
to place hope over the reality of Putin's track record]{.mark}
throughout the war.]{.underline}

#### Lethal arms sales to Ukraine will fail to tip the balance of forces against Russia.

[The [210 anti-tank missiles the State Department authorized is enough

The [[supply of]{.underline} [the Javelin antitank weapon

overdue and may be sending a wrong signal** to
Moscow.]{.mark}]{.underline} While these missiles are necessary, [[they
are supplied almost **four years after they were requested, and in small
numbers.**]{.underline}]{.mark} The Russian threat to Ukraine is not
only in the Donbas, but also from a potential massive ground invasion
from Russia with the purpose to occupy all of Ukraine. Therefore, the
Obama administration failed to supply this and other lethal weapon
systems when it was necessary. These systems needed to be airlifted and
Ukrainian troops immediately trained to use them in the spring and
summer of 2014. The [[supply of these weapons may be signaling to
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited

The [[advocates of arming Ukraine cite]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of
well-intentioned, yet nebulous and, in some cases, [[**erroneous**
motives for their position]{.underline}. [The primary argument
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must
support]{.mark} the [independence of a democratic, potential future NATO

years**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[27\] Since the outset of the conflict,

is,]{.underline}]{.mark} in effect, being [[realized.]{.underline}
[Another argument for arming Ukraine is that doing so strengthens NATO;

[[**None of these options is a panacea**. Economic sanctions can
demonstrate]{.underline}]{.mark} the West's [[resolve, but are
**unlikely to lead to significant change** in Russian
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} After all, [[**Russia is already heavily
sanctioned** by the West, and its economy has had time to
adapt.]{.underline}]{.mark} However, new sanctions might abrogate some
of the worries that unchecked Russian behavior will lead to future
aggression. To generate such an effect, [[the sanctions regime needs to
be extensive, both to show Western resolve and to make Putin take
notice. Yet the more extensive the sanctions, the more likely **innocent
Russians will bear the costs**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Information warfare campaigns against Russia will fail. They won't lead to actual change.

[[Information warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} might sound like turnabout's
fair play, given Russia's penchant for such tactics---and it would cause
little physical harm to civilians. But it [[is **unlikely to work.**
Russia's information campaigns against the West draw on decades of
careful research]{.mark}]{.underline} into the social and political
lives of Western democracies---[[bu]{.mark}t]{.underline} [this **[depth
of insight into Russia is lacking in the US]{.underline}**]{.mark} (and
most NATO members). Furthermore, [[even if an information warfare
campaign challenged Putin's popularity, it is **hardly likely to lead to
democratic reform** within Russia or]{.underline}]{.mark} even
**[[foreign policy change]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Ethically, information
warfare is deeply problematic---it may kill no one directly, but its
pernicious social effects can be unpredictable.

#### Naval visits and military advisors won't mitigate Russian expansion while risking escalation.

[[A naval guest visit to the Black Sea would **not actually

ground]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it could send a message that the US and

Ultimately, the ongoing situation in Ukraine presents a scenario in
which there is no best option. Instead, the US and its allies must
choose the least-worst response. [[A clear and united condemnation of
Russia's actions in the Kerch strait case, coupled with expanded
sanctions on officials and oligarchs close to Putin, are unlikely to
force Russia to drastically change its policy in
Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although [[sanctions are less effective at
signaling resolve than more militaristic measures,]{.underline}]{.mark}
an increased sanctions regime could still demonstrate a united front and
discourage Russian policymakers from assuming that future aggressive
acts will go unanswered.

[[Tayler asks us to "see matters from Russia's
perspective."]{.underline}]{.mark} While [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} may
be a necessary exercise for policymakers trying to make predictions
about Moscow's policies, it [[often entails **assuming
untruths**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[accepting [false
moral equivalence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [between Western action and
Russian "reactions"]{.underline} on the world stage. [[The West inviting
an independent country to a defensive alliance]{.underline} **[should
not be equated with Russia sending tank columns into
Georgia]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to seize territory]{.underline}**.
[[This is not a matter of perspective]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet Tayler
frequently argues as though Russia's self-pitying viewpoint is the
salient one. NATO, too, is perturbed by [[Tayler]{.mark}'s
[claims]{.mark}.]{.underline} Tayler published a response to his piece
by alliance spokesperson Oana Lungescu as a note, along with his own
rebuttal. Lungescu complained, rightly, that while Tayler has tremendous
sympathy for Russia's viewpoint, he carefully avoids assigning any blame
to Moscow. For example: Some perspective is in order. When Russia, in
its Soviet incarnation, was strong, the United States did not intervene
to thwart the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 or combat the Soviet
invasions in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Nor did it
counter Poland's imposition of martial law in 1981. [As much as the
United States supported Eastern European movements for
democracy]{.underline} (rhetorically, at least), [it]{.underline}
recognized they were [taking place within the Soviet sphere of
influence]{.underline}, where strategically, militarily, and
geographically, Moscow held all the cards. This is all the more so in
Ukraine. At the very least, [[NATO would be wise to evaluate the outcome
of its expansions]{.mark} and U.S. support]{.underline} for the
post-Yanukovych, pro-NATO regime in Kiev: nearly 10,000 deaths in a
stalemated civil war in Ukraine's east, plus the effective loss of the
two embattled ethnic Russian provinces; [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
politically paralyzed, [[pro-Western Ukrainian
government]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[is likely at least as corrupt as
the one it replaced]{.mark}; the takeover of Crimea]{.underline}; an
ominous military buildup in Russia; a risk of nuclear conflict now
perhaps as high as it was during the worst years of the Cold War, or
higher. **[[The idea that the blame for the situation]{.mark} in eastern
Ukraine [rests at the feet of the West is
dubious]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Who is more responsible for the
current chaos and death]{.underline}? [Washington, for its tepid support
for the]{.underline}]{.mark} Poroshenko-[[Yatsenyuk government, voted
in]{.mark} months [after Russia's unmarked brigades]{.mark}]{.underline}
had already seized swathes of Ukraine? **[[Or Russia, for invading its
Western neighbor and lying about it]{.underline}]{.mark}**, after its
attempts to persuade the neighbor's kleptocratic ruler to back away from
a popular pro-Western deal led to his ouster? An Atlantic reader
provides a nice reality check: [[Nobody forced Putin to invade Ukraine
and no one is forcing him to start military
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Any [backing off will simply
encourage him to try to rebuild the Russian
empire]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[which is no one's
interest]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** not even the
Russians'. [[We have no more reason to respect the]{.mark} former
[Russian empire than we have to respect the former British
empire]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia is a declining power with a GDP
about the size of Canada\'s. It will decline further, and the
oligarch-dominated government will neither stop the population decline
nor reinvigorate the economy. [Here's one more paragraph from Tayler's
piece: As a starting point, the debate should assess whether NATO's
relentless expansion]{.underline}---begun during the 1990s and
proceeding in waves, with Montenegro's eventual accession, once-Soviet
Ukraine and Georgia having been promised membership, and even
historically neutral Finland and Sweden now pondering
participation---[played a role in Russia's increasingly aggressive
posturing toward the West]{.underline}. As the world's most powerful
military alliance slid up to Russia's borders, the West couldn't have
expected Putin to sit idle. [Whatever the merits of NATO expansion, has
it been]{.underline} truly "[relentless"?]{.underline} [Or is it more
accurate to say that the 28 members joined on seven distinct occasions
over 67 years? [Tayler suggests that Putin was clearly provoked by the
alliance's growth]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[and could not simply leave
independent countries alone.]{.underline}** [[Under that logic,
challenging Georgia,]{.underline} [annexing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Abkhazia and [South Ossetia, stirring a crisis in eastern
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[that has now claimed almost 10,000
lives,]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and playing the victim while ducking
responsibility**, [was a reasonable response on Putin's
part]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [These]{.underline}]{.mark}, I would
submit, [**[are far from reasonable responses to NATO's
growth]{.underline}**. [Yet,]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Tayler's piece,
there are more instances of taking Putin's logic at face value. [We are
told]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [[that "NATO's]{.mark} continued
European expansion]{.underline} through the decades, [like its bo[mbing
campaigns in]{.mark} the former [Yugoslavia to coerce an end to]{.mark}
internecine [wars tearing the region apart, demonstrated a willingness
to use force in Russia's backyard]{.mark}]{.underline} against one of
its historical allies.\" **[[It takes some mental gerrymandering to
accept this claim]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [Kosovo is 1,893 kilometers
from Moscow. By contrast, it is 697 kilometers from Rome]{.underline},
567 from Athens, 717 from Vienna, 1,238 from Geneva, and 1,043 from
Ankara. [[In his analysis, Tayler evaded the fact that **Putin's foreign
policy involves invading neighbors, threatening to nuke Danish
ships**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Baltic, **[[and conducting
assassinations]{.mark} in places like London]{.underline}** and
Washington. [Putin is attempting to morally blackmail the remaining true
world powers into treating Russia like one of them, in an effort to
maintain his grip on power]{.underline} by way of nationalist appeal.
[**Giving into this blackmail is not a sound strategy.** [There are
legitimate complaints]{.mark} Russia [can]{.mark} and does [make against
America]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Washington has far too close a
relationship with]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[the democracy-promoting
"quasi-NGOs]{.underline}**" or "QUANGOs" in Russia [that constitute some
of the U.S. support for [regime change]{.mark}.]{.underline} (It is,
[[however]{.underline}]{.mark}, worth remembering why an organization
that seeks to give a country's people a say in their own government is
inherently inimical to the Putin regime.) [Tayler does not address why
it's the West that should make all the concessions necessary to improve
relations with Moscow]{.underline}. [It's especially strange that he
does not explore whether Russia might itself help bring this détente,
2.0, nearer by compromising on some of its desires. That seems the
better option, since the Russian leader deemed the end of the Soviet
empire, under which half of Europe was enslaved, "the greatest
geopolitical catastrophe" of the 20th century. The most confounding idea
in Tayler's original post is]{.underline} this: "Détente 2.0 would
entail the renunciation, in writing, of NATO's plans to invite Ukraine
and Georgia, coupled with Moscow's recognition that both countries
retain the right to join whatever economic or political union they
desire." [Tayler asks us [to accept a world that effectively]{.mark}
offers the countries Russia believes reside within its sphere of
influence the choice of any alliance they want]{.underline}, **[so long
as it [isn't NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[and any geopolitics they
like]{.underline}, [**so long as it [adheres to Moscow's
revisionism.]{.mark}** Tayler's piece,]{.underline} in the end,
[**[offers us a choice between letting Russia have its way with eastern
Europe and]{.mark} risking [war that may well be nuclear]{.mark}**.
There is every reason to think that **[this is a false
binary.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [If it isn't,]{.underline} **[NATO is

[Any foreign policy strategy is based on ambitions, objectives,
apprehensions and values of a state's leadership.]{.underline} So before
addressing directly the subject of my essay, I am compelled to devote
some time to this political motivation of the Russian leadership's
behaviour. We all remember the famous Churchill saying: 'Russia is a
riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.' But fortunately, in our
current situation, we possess a key to this riddle/mystery/enigma. [[One
hundred percent of Russian foreign policy is driven by]{.mark} one
person, Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}. The key to Russian foreign policy, its
strategy, its set of motivations and interests, all of it comes from
this one particular person. Putin's highest priority is to remain in
power forever.]{.underline} He saw what happened to Mubarak and
especially what happened to Gaddafi when they had lost power, and he
became determined never to leave the Kremlin. [Until this recent
Ukrainian crisis, the Putin regime was an authoritarian kleptocracy
without much of an ideological pretence. It had no foreign agenda beyond
motor reaction to what it perceived as external threats. And certainly
Ukraine's European aspirations and its Europe-bound political vector
were perceived by Putin's Russia as an existential threat because
Ukraine's success would present an undesirable example for the Russian
society.]{.underline} That is why he first tried to bully and bribe
Yanukovych into refusing an association agreement with the European
Union. [And then after Yanukovych's kleptocracy was overthrown, [Putin
became determined to either bend Ukraine]{.mark} completely [to his will
or else to dismantle it]{.mark}. And the first act on that agenda was
the annexation of Crimea, the act by which Putin's Russia broke a dozen
of international agreements signed by the Russian
Federation.]{.underline} I think that [[Putin's Crimea speech]{.mark}
delivered by him for the occasion of Crimea and Sevastopol formally
joining the Russian Federation [was a political event even more
important than the annexation]{.mark} of Crimea itself. The task for
[Putin]{.mark} during this speech was to legitimise, to justify, or even
to glorify the act of annexation. But he did much more. He fulfilled an
even more important mission. He [created a new ideology of the
so-called]{.mark} 'Russkiy Mir,' the [Russian World.]{.mark} No
dictatorship can sustain on violence and intimidation alone. [A
protracted dictatorship needs some kind of]{.mark} an ideology or a
[mythology that would appeal to a considerable part of the
population]{.mark} for a considerable span of time]{.underline}: like
Hitler's ideology of the superiority of the German people or Stalin's
ideology of communism. Many pundits, myself included, noted that
[[Putin's Crimea speech was a remake of the]{.mark} German Chancellor
[**Hitler's Sudetenland speech**]{.mark} delivered for the occasion of
annexation of Sudetenland. Putin's Crimea speech [borrowed heavily from
the main concepts and even from the terminology of Nazi political
foreign policy and propaganda.]{.mark} First came this concept of a
'divided nation.']{.underline} Putin informed us that [we, the Russian
people, are a 'divided nation.']{.underline} This was the first time
this term was used in such a high level speech. Next [he justified the
Crimean annexation as a part of gathering of historically Russian
lands.]{.underline} Then [[he coined a new label for his
opponents,]{.mark} 'Natsional-predateli,' or
[**'nation-traitors**.']{.mark} That set a new tone as there previously
had been no such term in the Soviet or Russian political
vernacular.]{.underline} The Soviets' opponents were castigated as
'enemies of the people', [while 'nationtraitors' or
'Natsional-predateli' is a]{.underline} [**[pure Nazi
vocabulary]{.mark}**.]{.underline} However [the most important concept
was the concept of the 'Russian World'. [Putin claims it is]{.mark}
[his]{.mark} right and even a [**sacred duty** to
protect]{.mark}]{.underline} not citizens -- not Russian citizens -- but
ethnic Russians or Russian language speakers, all over the world. And to
demonstrate that Crimea was only the first step in promoting the Russkiy
Mir agenda, Putin immediately initiated another stage. He also coined
another new term, 'Novorossiya' ('new Russia'). By Novorossiya he is
referring to the eight Ukranian regions, which were, in his opinion,
unjustly handed over to Ukraine after the Bolshevik revolution. So now
Putin has created a long-term ideological system he can use to justify
his role forever, because it is a very long-term program. Any dictator,
as I already noted, needs such an excuse. It's much more convenient to
claim he is promoting the great Russian idea from the Kremlin, than to
admit he was just sitting there to make tens of billions of dollars for
himself and his cronies. These were no empty words or slogans. His
hybrid war against Ukraine is going on now. There are ups and downs. As
I already mentioned, the main objective is to control Kiev, to control
the Ukrainian government and Ukraine as a whole. He doesn't need an
annexation of Donetsk and Luhansk. Coincidentally he is now the most
ardent supporter of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, except for
Crimea, of course. He needs to have the cancerous tumour of Novorossiya
inside Ukraine to spread instability and chaos. But Kremlin propaganda
offices present these events not as a war of Russia with Ukraine. Every
day on the TV, Kremlin talking heads tell us that it's much more than
that. It's a war between Russia and the United States of America.
Ukraine is just terrain on which this war is being staged. Even more
philosophically, it is a war between Russkiy Mir, the Russian world, and
the Anglo-Saxon world. Putin explains that we [[Russians]{.mark} have a
[**unique genetic code**, superior to the genetic code of the]{.mark}
Anglo-Saxon [world because]{.mark} Anglo-Saxons are mercantile, they are
concerned about their own enrichment, and [due to our]{.mark} specific
[Russian genetic code, we possess more
spirituality.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, [one of the Kremlin
guys]{.underline} -- Vyacheslav Nikonov, grandson of Vyacheslav Molotov
--- [has made a historic claim that Russians are an Aryan tribe which
descended from the Carpathian mountains and spread all over the
world]{.underline} until they reached Fort Ross, California. [No state
or regime goes to war firmly convinced that it will lose it and Vladimir
Putin is no exception: [if he goes to war with NATO he will be acting
based on the belief that he can win it]{.mark}. That belief is [based on
Putin's assumption that]{.mark} the logic of the mutually assured
destruction ([MAD]{.mark}) regime that prevented a major war between
Russia and the West **[is broken due to divisions within the
West]{.mark}** regarding how to respond to a limited Russian nuclear
strike.]{.underline} If we read Putin correctly, [the world is in a far
more dangerous situation than most have thought and the risks to
Russia's neighbours, the West and Russia itself are far greater. Even
the most modest practical realisation of Putin's idea of 'assembling the
Russian lands' requires changes of the national borders of at least two
NATO member countries: Latvia and Estonia.]{.underline} Because of the
Western alliance's Article 5 in which an attack on one is an attack on
all, that would seem impossible given MAD. [But the MAD doctrine
considered only a single most destructive scenario of a military
conflict between nuclear powers, total war. The doctrine of mutually
assured destruction **is still valid**, and it prevents a full-scale
world war. But [there are]{.mark} other [scenarios]{.mark}, **[including
the]{.mark} limited [use of nuclear weapons]{.mark}** by one side under
conditions where the other side does not respond lest that lead to
'mutual suicide.']{.underline} In his classic books On Thermonuclear War
and Thinking About The Unthinkable, Dr. Herman Kahn, a pre-eminent
nuclear strategist and one of the founders of the Hudson Institute,
pondered a potential scenario of a limited nuclear war initiated by a
nuclear power in order to achieve certain political objectives. It is
feasible that in a more volatile geopolitical situation, a nuclear power
determined to change the status quo, armed with the advantage of
political will, and indifferent to the value of human lives, be it its
own or those of others, while being inspired by certain adventurism,
could achieve serious foreign policy gains through the threat of limited
application of nuclear weapons or through the actual limited application
itself. [[**Russian military doctrine has been recently changed**
allowing Russia to use nuclear weapons in regional and]{.mark} even
[local conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Clearly [Putin]{.underline} does
not seek the destruction of the hated United States, a goal that he
could achieve only at the price of mutual suicide. Instead, [his goals
are significantly more modest: the maximum extension of the Russian
World, the breakdown of NATO, and the discrediting and humiliation of
the US as the guarantor of the security of the West. To put it in
simplest terms, Putin's actions would be a revenge for the defeat of the
USSR]{.underline} in the third (cold) world war [just as the second
world war was for Germany an attempt at revenge for defeat in the
first.]{.underline} Let us follow Herman Kahn and try to think a bit
about the unthinkable. Let us contemplate that some day in the Estonian
city of Narva, which has a predominately Russian population, Putin's
'polite green men' conduct a referendum and the Kremlin says, well, this
part of Estonian territory historically belongs to the Russian world.
Well, a year ago, the annexation of Ukraine was unthinkable, so we
should think about such kinds of scenarios. The Estonian government,
referring to Article 5 of the NATO agreement, asks NATO countries to
help. And if NATO countries can help, their joint military might would
be much stronger than the Russian Army. At this point, Putin publicly
states or says in private talks with his 'partners' in Europe; 'OK, we
realise that a more powerful conventional military force is ready to
confront us in our pursuit of the Russian world agenda, so we are ready
to use a nuclear weapon if NATO conventional forces try to eject us from
Estonia.' How will Western politicians react? It is difficult to
predict. I think that a vast majority of people both in Europe and in
the United States would say that we are not ready to die for Narva, just
as many Europeans stated in 1930s that they were not ready to die for
Danzig. So this situation will present an unthinkable choice for the
West: either a humiliating capitulation by refusing to help Estonia that
in turn would also mean the end of NATO, the end of Western alliance,
the end of the United States as the guarantor of Western security, or
providing help that would lead to war with a thermonuclear power. Putin
seems to be convinced that the West would blink, and that he can outplay
Western countries and their leaders in potential military conflicts that
would occur along the path to the realisation of his great idea of the
Russian World. Regardless of the fact that Russia is much weaker in
conventional arms than NATO and does not have an advantage over the US
in nuclear ones. 'By the spirit we will take them,' Putin calculates.
'By the spirit and by boldness.' [Putin's plans are extremely
adventurist but he believes they have chances for success. Nuclear
bullying and nuclear blackmail are going on with growing intensity as
part of psychological warfare against West. Almost every one of Putin's
statements includes the phrase 'Don't forget that we're a nuclear
power.']{.underline} There was a scandalous performance during a meeting
with a top Russian official in August in Sochi, when Vice Speaker of the
Duma Mr. Zhirinovsky threatened to completely annihilate the Baltic
States and Poland. Mr. Putin was present and in summing up the panel
discussion, he noted approvingly that Vladimir Zhirinovsky's speech was
very vivid and flamboyant, and only added that maybe not all of his
words reflected current government policy.

#### Russian threats are not about a response to US securitization -- Rather it is motivated by the belief in a "Superior Russian Identity" -- Any evidence pre-Crimea should be ignored 

**Freire, '18** (Maria Raquel, PhD in International Relations from the
University of Kent, UK, researcher at the Centre for Social Studies and
Associate Professor of International Relations at the School of
Economics of the University of Coimbra, "The quest for status: how the
interplay of power, ideas, and regime security shapes Russia's policy in
the post‑Soviet space," International Politics, 4/27, p 1-15, bgm)

[First, power politics underlines the goal of recognition of Russia as a
great power]{.underline}, involving a strong military-defense
component.1 [[The perceived need for self-defense against]{.mark} a
policy of Western [encirclement has been emphasized]{.mark} repeatedly
[in Russian policy documents, with the enlargement
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO)
constituting a main threat]{.underline}]{.mark} (RFP 2016; Military
Doctrine 2014). Moreover, the repositioning of Russia as a major power
with prevailing influence in the post-Soviet space has been sought both
in territorial terms (annexation of Crimea) and on the basis of
consolidating its influence in the area. Evidence of the latter is found
in security arrangements and other economic and political treaties
signed with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. As for Crimea's annexation, this
became a demonstration of Russian hard power in a geopolitically driven
move, displaying the disposition to use force, if need be, in the
attainment of its self-perceived goals. Indeed, Mearsheimer (2014) has
argued that international pressures, namely offensive actions of the
West and geostrategic imperatives, were the main drivers of Russia's
policies toward Ukraine. [[**However**, the Black Sea Fleet stationed in
the Crimean peninsula]{.underline} **[was already under Russian
control]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and an agreement was in place [until
2042.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Arguably, [[even if the choice to intervene
militarily can be understood as rational]{.underline}, **[the risks
associated with it were extremely high]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Forsberg
and Pursiainen 2017: 224). Moreover, [[the Russian rhetoric of
justifying the 'reintegration' of the Crimean
territory]{.underline}]{.mark} on the basis of history and international
law (the self-determination of peoples, with the 'responsibility to
protect' as a justification) [[indicates that more than **narrower
geopolitical interests were at play.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [All of this
suggests that [a purely power-political reading of Russian foreign
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[limits our understanding]{.mark} of
Moscow's choices.]{.underline}** Second, **[ideational factors
have]{.underline}** also **[been an important factor in shaping Russian
foreign policy]{.underline}**. Russia seeks Western recognition of its
great-power status, including through the acknowledgment of its system
of values and institutions as legitimate. This indicates that [[Moscow
**understands its identity as distinctive**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Indeed, [[an identity-related framing of foreign policy]{.underline}
**[underpins many Russian statements]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[about its
place in the international system]{.underline}** (Ambrosio 2005: viii).
As Tsygankov (2014: 347) puts it, '[[Russia's identity]{.mark} or sense
of honor is not limited to protection of state]{.underline}
international [status]{.underline}/prestige [in the eyes of other
states]{.underline}, **[but]{.underline}** also [**[includes a
distinctive idea of national self.]{.underline}**' [This has become
increasingly clear in Moscow's foreign policy
formulation]{.underline}]{.mark}[, s]{.underline}uch as [[the last
Foreign Policy Concept]{.underline}]{.mark} (approved in 2016), which
[[addresses **Russia's uniqueness in the promotion of 'global
civilization'**]{.underline}]{.mark} (RFP 2016). [In other words, [ideas
about a unique identity and values-set]{.mark},]{.underline} distinct
from a decadent West, [[permeate the discourse informing the
construction of a substantive understanding]{.mark} about
status]{.underline}. Moreover, identity permeates the discourse about
Russian minorities abroad and how Moscow should reach out to protect and
defend their rights and interests when at risk. [[These identity-based
aspects of foreign policy]{.mark} relate to power-driven ones. Together,
they [allow for a more encompassing understanding of how Russian foreign
policy is shaped and conducted.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Russia's violent occupation of the Baltic States transformed into a form of colonialism -- rejecting re-expansion is A-Priori, must come before kritik impacts.

Thus [I claim]{.underline} that [the Russians did not colonize the
Baltic states]{.underline}. Instead, [they occupied them,]{.underline}
and this is not to be equated with colonisation. [Yet [the Baltic case
seems to defy the archetypal story of
occupation]{.mark}]{.underline}[-]{.mark}that of the French resistance,
[[a story based on]{.underline}]{.mark} binary thinking with
[[occupation opposed by resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, the
oppressors are hated, their voice is not accepted in the occupied
country as a voice of truth, and, under a thin veil of collaboration,
the natives respond with proud denial. A wonderful story to tell[. [I
would love to describe the]{.mark} almost [50 years of Russian
dictatorship in the Baltics in these terms - only that it just is not
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Between 1940 and 1945, more than a
million people in the Baltics had]{.mark} died or [been
killed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, had escaped, **[or been sent to
Siberia]{.underline}**. During the years 1940-52 more than 203, 000
people were deported from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (Vahtre 2005:
274). [[The Baltic states]{.underline}]{.mark} had
**[[lost]{.underline}]{.mark}** approximately **[[one fifth of their
population. Those who tried to offer resistance were ruthlessly
silenced]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 Thus [the new situation
emerged]{.underline}. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} simple **[[opposition
between oppressors and oppressed started to
dissolve]{.underline}]{.mark}** and become complicated - because it
became clear that the [resistance would not harm the enemy at all. The
occupation-resistance scheme can work only when there is hope that the
occupation can end soon - [when there is no hope]{.mark}]{.underline} at
all, [[resistance]{.mark} in its absolute denial of collaboration [is
left for very few]{.mark} selfless and dedicated
nationalists]{.underline}. It can be a dominant model during a war (even
though oppressors always find collaborators), it can be an important
model for some years after the war. There were people hiding in the
woods and fighting the regime until about ten years after the end of war
(in Lithuania, from 1944 to 1952 approximately [100,000 Lithuanians
participated in]{.underline} partisan [fights against the Soviet
system]{.underline} and the Red Army), [but, one after
another]{.underline}, [they were caught or killed]{.underline} or simply
gave up. [[What was left was a situation where]{.mark} the majority of
the people took the new regime for granted. By the 1980s,]{.underline}
thirty or fourty years into the occupation, **[basically [the whole
population in the Baltic states]{.mark} had [started to collaborate with
a new regime]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, [almost all [children
were organized into communist youth organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It was possible to refuse to become a member, but it is rather
remarkable that [[parents]{.underline}]{.mark} almost unanimously agreed
with the teachers' demands. Why? Maybe partly [[because of the memory of
Stalinist terror]{.underline}]{.mark}, they **[[did not want their
children to differ]{.mark} from others.]{.underline}** But most of all
[[it was]{.underline}]{.mark} just [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} silent
[[concession that the Soviet regime had the brute power to mould the
life of their children]{.underline}]{.mark} - that one must follow the
rule of the game. Simple binary oppositions started to fall apart.
Instead of a categorical "I will do anything I can to resist the
regime," people started thinking: \"How can I live in the best possible
way, given the fact that the Russians won't leave this country? And how
can my children live in the best possible way inside the communist
empire?" The oppressed started leading their lives within the framework
of rules established by the oppressors. And [[so a situation emerged
that has]{.mark}]{.underline} some **[[significant affinities
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** typical **[[colonial
oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [new forms of hybridity started to
appear,]{.underline} **[[the culture of the oppressed]{.mark}
territories and the identity of oppressed people [became infected by the
new regime]{.mark}]{.underline}** - and **[[this influence
had]{.underline}]{.mark}** already some [**[significant similarities
with Western]{.mark} models of [colonialism]{.mark}.** Thus [I would
propose that, even though]{.mark} Communist [Russia did not colonize the
Baltic states]{.mark}]{.underline} and instead "occupied" the Baltic
states, nevertheless **[[the period of occupation turned into]{.mark} a
period of [colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [as the modes of
resistance turned into hybrid coexistence with the new
power.]{.underline} Occupation has a short life-span; if an occupation
does not end by expelling the occupiers from the country, then it
acquires features of colonialism: the occupants settle in the occupied
territory, their ideology starts to change the ways how the occupied
relate to the world. The oppressed country can, of course, still be
called an occupied country, yet the economical, social and cultural
models at work are those of a colonial enterprise. Note here that I am
making a distinction between colonization and colonialism. Generally
these terms are used quite loosely, yet I reserve the term
"colonization" only for the political and economical act of establishing
settler colonies. Colonialism I use as a wider term, both temporally and
ideologically: Colonialism is colonization plus what follows after the
establishment of a colonial power. Thus [colonialism is a set of
political, economical, social and cultural issues]{.underline}. I claim
that it is possible to separate colonization from colonialism and to
have colonialism without a prior act of colonization. Now we should ask
more serious questions about colonialism, in order to prove our
hypothesis about Soviet colonialism. [What are the typical features of
[colonialism]{.mark}? Firstly, foreign supremacy is
established]{.underline} over a certain territory; Secondly, the
supremacy is guaranteed by the technological mastery lacking in the
culture of the colonized; Third, [the economy of the territory is
(re)constructed in order to serve the interests of the
colonizers:]{.underline} whereas the know-how and intelligentsia come
from colonisers, the hard labour is, whenever possible, provided by
locals; Fourth, even though the establishing of power might have been
bloody, after the system has been established, it generally works
without constant and oppressive military supervision; Fifth, the foreign
power presents itself and is accepted by the majority of natives as an
enlightenment project; (Said: "Both \[imperialism and colonialism\] are
supported and perhaps even impelled by impressive ideological formations
that include notions that certain territories and people require and
beseech domination, as well as forms of knowledge affiliated with
domination", Cl 9); Sixth, [the identity of the local population becomes
based on the presence of others]{.underline}, who are perceived as
superior, or more precisely, whose presence makes the natives feel
themselves as secondary and unworthy. The experience of being oppressed
becomes an important aspect of the local culture. You see that my
typology here is incomplete, I have left out, for example, the impact of
the colonial situation over the colonizer which is not my interest here.
[The]{.underline} first and third condition, [foreign rule and
economical exploitation]{.underline} **[[describe well the situation in
the Baltic states]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As for economy, [[the Baltic
economy was **completely remodeled**]{.mark} **according to the needs of
Moscow**]{.underline}. [The Baltic economy ceased to be oriented towards
serving the needs of the local people, instead, it started to provide
products for Russia]{.underline}. Economic power in the Soviet Union
was, of course, concentrated in Moscow. The cornerstone of the economy
of occupied Estonia, for example, became oil-shale industry and
production of electricity, of which about 80 % was exported to Russia
(Mettam and Williams 1989: 371). [[Even though Baltic farmers produced
more]{.mark} meat [than the local market could consume]{.mark}, still
[in the Baltics there was a shortage]{.mark} of meat, [because
most]{.mark} of the meat [travelled to the Russian
metropolis]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} However, communist Russia's
employment policies were not typically colonial. The communist model
relied on local intelligentsia, and imported manual labour to the
oppressed countries. The Baltic states had a large, well-educated middle
class. There was no need to import engineers, teachers or accountants.
For its part, the importation of uneducated Russian labourers was a
feature of population politics in the Soviet Union: to assimilate
smaller nations, they would overwhelm them by flooding their territories
with the larger Russian population. In the year 1934 there were roughly
93,000 Russians living in Estonia; by 1989 that number had grown
five-fold to nearly half a million (475,000). If you keep in mind that
the Estonian-speaking population has remained slightly under a million,
you can see the vastness of that change in a population. This indicates
a much more serious assimilation politics than the one used by Western
colonialism, generally speaking. As for the second point the Russina
supremacy was not guaranteed by the technological mastery, but instead
by the military forces far outnumbering the military of the attacked
countries. This sounds more like occupation than colonization. Point
four, the question of controlling the dominant power is, again,
different in the Soviet occupation, as compared to Western
colonizations. According to Edward Said, in colonised India were in
1930s 4000 British officials, 60,000 soldiers and 300 million Indians.
Estonia had one million inhabitants, thus, keeping the same balance it
would have meant about 15 Russian bureaucrats and about 200 soldiers.
The fact was that for most Indians the power of the colonisers was not
visible as an oppressive power supported by bare military force. [[The
Baltic countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [**[were overcrowded
with]{.mark} the Russian [military]{.mark}** personnel who did not speak
the local languages, and [who guarded the borders]{.mark} and major
settlements with the utmost care, day and night]{.underline}. [Typical
of that situation was the tragedy of ethnic Livonians]{.underline}, a
small Finno-Ugric ethnic community [living in the territory of
[Latvia]{.mark}, whose [main occupation had been
fishing]{.mark}]{.underline} for centuries and **[who [were now
prohibited from coming close]{.mark}r [to the sea]{.mark} than 50
metres]{.underline}**. Without the very visible fact that the oppressing
regime was overwhelmingly stronger and more populous than the oppressed,
the Russian regime would have not been possible. The fifth point.
Western colonialism was presented as an enlightenment poject and it was
generally taken as such. [The Russian occupation,]{.underline} however,
[was understood in the Baltics]{.underline} **[as a]{.underline}**
barbarian **[invasion]{.underline}**. As we already mentioned, [[the
Baltic states were nation-states with an established national
culture.]{.mark} Whereas [the Russian invaders **mythologized their
invasion as an enlightenment project** educating]{.mark}]{.underline}
allegedly [[illiterate natives, in Estonia]{.mark},]{.underline} to the
contrary, one of the myths of the Russian invasion is, that the wives of
the Russian officers, who had not seen fully equipped stores for twenty
years, bought Estonian nightgowns and wore these as party dresses. This
story, still often told, summarizes the position of the occupied
countries: people felt the presence of barbarians, who were culturally
ridiculous, but who unfortunately had a very large and ruthless army.
The story of enlightenment, though told by Russians to Russians, was
never accepted in the Baltic states. Thus we have an interesting,
multivoiced situation: the official story for the Russian state was to
help the workers around the world and to liberate the Baltic states from
their bourgeois governments. Behind this story we can easily discover
the two-fold discourse of colonialism: the story of bringing
enlightenment to the wilderness and behind it the ty pical imperialist
desire to gain new territories and new commodities Sure enough, Russian
oppressors made sure that in the public sphere only their discourse was
present - yet their discourse was taken as a manifestation of power, not
as a truth to be believed in. We see already that the colonial regime
established by communist Russia did have some very specific features.
Apart from the above-mentioned lack of \'modem state versus premodem
state' situation, two additional factors determined the situation;
firstly, the communist ideology, secondly, the totalitarian regime. The
totalitarian regime created the basic lack of freedom, closed the
borders so that nobody could escape, and kept a very strict physical
control over the oppressed. The communist ideology created a specific
language, which was not openly colonial-and indeed described itself as
anticolonial. In all the Soviet empire, the official ideology was that
of equality\'. In communism, all nations and all people were supposed to
be equal. Thus, [the communist ideology, together with totalitarian and
colonial ideologies, created a complex fusion, where communist, colonial
and totalitarian features merge into one another. Colonialism meant
forced communism]{.underline}. It created a situation where communist
vocabulary became the official language, yet very few speakers of that
language believed in the words they uttered. [The totalitarian regime
made sure that only acceptable language was spoken.]{.underline}

Why [Uncertainty Is **Not Cause for Reassurance**]{.underline} [Each of
our estimates rely to some extent on guesswork and remain highly
uncertain]{.underline}. Technological breakthroughs in areas such as
diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, as well as vastly improved
surveillance, or even eventual space colonization, could reduce the
chance of disease-related extinction by many orders of magnitude. Other
breakthroughs such as highly distributed DNA synthesis or improved
understanding of how to construct and modify diseases could increase or
decrease the risks. Destabilizing political forces, the breakdown of the
Biological Weapons Convention, or warfare between major world powers
could vastly increase the amount of investment in bioweapons and create
the incentives to actively use knowledge and biotechnology in
destructive ways. Each of these [factors suggests that our wide
estimates could still be many orders of magnitude off]{.underline} from
the true risk in this century. But uncertainty is not cause for
reassurance. [[In instances where the **probability** of a catastrophe
is thought to be **extremely low**]{.underline}]{.mark} (eg, human
extinction from bioweapons), [[greater **uncertainty**]{.mark} around
the estimates [will]{.mark} typically [imply **greater risk of the
catastrophe**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as we have **reduced confidence
that the risk is actually at a low level**]{.underline}.48 §§§ Given
that our conservative models are based on historical data, they fail to
account for the primary source of future risk: technological development
that could radically democratize the ability to build advanced
bioweapons. If the cost and required expertise of developing bioweapons
falls far enough, the world might enter a phase where offensive
capabilities dominate defensive ones. Some scholars, such as Martin
Rees, think that humanity has about a 50% chance of going extinct due in
large part to such technologies.49 However, incorporating these
intuitions and technological conjectures would mean relying on
qualitative arguments that would be far more contentious than our
conservative estimates. We therefore proceed to assess the
cost-effectiveness on the basis of our conservative models, until
superior models of the risk emerge. [How Bad Would]{.underline} Human
[[Extinction]{.mark} Be]{.underline}? Human extinction would [[not only
end]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[7 billion lives]{.underline}]{.mark} in
our current generation, **[[but also cause the loss of all future
generations]{.mark} to come]{.underline}**. [To calculate the
humanitarian cost associated with such a catastrophe, [one must]{.mark}
therefore [include]{.mark} the welfare of [these]{.mark} future
[generations]{.mark}]{.underline}. While some have argued that future
generations ought to be excluded or discounted when considering ethical
actions,50 [[most]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [[in-depth philosophical
work]{.mark} around the topic [has concluded that future generations
should not be given less]{.mark} inherent
[value]{.mark}]{.underline}.51-55 Therefore, for our calculations, we
include future lives in our cost-effectiveness estimate.\*\*\*\* [The
large number of future generations at stake mean that]{.underline}
**[[reducing existential risk even by a small amount may have very large
expected value]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The Earth is thought to be
habitable for roughly another billion years]{.underline};56 our closest
relative, homo erectus, lasted over 1.6 million years,57 and the typical
mammalian species also lasts on the order of 1 to 2 million years.58
Following Matheny,29 [if we were to assume that humanity would otherwise
maintain a global population of 10 billion]{.underline} for the next 1.6
million years, [human extinction would jeopardize on the order of
1.6 × 1016 life years.]{.underline} Cost-Effective Biosecurity How
should we balance speculative risks of human extinction in a biosecurity
portfolio? Here we turn to cost-effectiveness analysis, which is one
method of prioritizing public projects.29 Cost-effectiveness analysis is
helpful if our goal is to maximize the effect of our resources to
achieve a measurable aim (such as life-years saved or cases of disease
averted). Here we compare the cost-effectiveness of reducing risks in
the categories of incidents, events, disasters, and existential risks.
Calculating Costs The US federal government was projected to spend
almost \$13 billion on health security--related programs in 2017.59 To
our knowledge, there has not been a quantitative assessment of how this
spending has reduced the chances of bioterrorism, biowarfare, or even
naturally occurring pandemics. However, the World Bank estimates that it
would cost \$1.9 billion to \$3.4 billion per year over 5 years to bring
all human and animal health systems up to minimal international
standards, and it suggests that these measures would prevent at least
20% of pandemics.60†††† Many countries do not currently have healthcare
systems that meet international standards---for example, in 2014 only
33% of countries reported their national arrangements met those required
under the International Health Regulations.61 These mitigation measures
would be adopted to be effective regardless of whether a disease
outbreak originates naturally, accidentally, or deliberately.‡‡‡‡ The
ability to rapidly detect and characterize the agent involved helps
fast-track public health and R&D responses. Acting promptly enables
basic public health measures that might decrease the likelihood of
spread (such as social distancing) and track its emerging epidemiology
(providing critical input for tailoring the responses). Even if we lack
existing or candidate vaccines or therapeutics, having the capacity to
treat symptoms can have a dramatic impact on case fatality rates.§§§§ We
therefore assume that strengthening healthcare systems to meet
international standards would have an impact on mitigating all types of
disease risk, ranging from incidents and events to existential
risks.\*\*\*\*\* We extend the World Bank\'s assumptions to include
bioterrorism and biowarfare---that is, we assume that the healthcare
infrastructure would reduce bioterrorism and biowarfare fatalities by
20%. We conservatively assume that existential risks will be reduced by
only 1%, since any potential existential risk would likely be
deliberately designed to overcome medical countermeasures. We calculate
that purchasing 1 century\'s worth of global protection in this form
would cost on the order of \$250 billion, assuming that subsequent
maintenance costs are lower but that the entire system needs
intermittent upgrading.††††† To calculate the cost per life-year saved,
we use the equation C/(N × L × R), where C is the cost of reducing risk,
N is the number of biothreats we expect to occur in 1 century, L is the
number of life-years lost in such an event, and R is the reduction in
risk achieved by spending a given amount (specified by C). For
nonextinction risks, we increase L 50 times over to denote 50 life-years
saved per life. The denominator N × L × R denotes the total number of
life-years saved.‡‡‡‡‡ In a subsequent model we also apply a discount
rate to represent policymakers concerned only about lives in the short
term. Including future generations into our cost-effectiveness
calculations demonstrates that reducing existential risks, even if they
are improbable, can be incredibly cost-effective in expectation (Table
2). Depending on the model used, we estimate that we can purchase 1
quality adjusted life-year in expectation for 10s of dollars (with
outliers suggested around 12 cents to \$1,600). Even with the most
conservative estimates of existential risk, reducing the risk of human
extinction is at least 100 times more cost-effective than standard
biosecurity interventions, and possibly up to 1 million times more
cost-effective. It is important to note that this result does not depend
on the \$250 billion figure---if we found a cheaper intervention that
reduced all risks by a similar amount, cost-effectiveness of all the
interventions would increase, but the relative merits of reducing
existential risk would remain the same.§§§§§ There are certainly cheaper
ways to reduce the low-level risks of biocrime and bioterrorism, and so
our estimates of cost-effectiveness could be far too pessimistic.
Examples of cheaper interventions might include dramatically increasing
resources for specialized law enforcement prevention and interdiction,
or increased surveillance on potential perpetrators. However, there are
likely also far cheaper ways of reducing the more extreme risks that
threaten extinction, and there is no reason to think similar efficiency
gains could not be made in this area as well. Despite the vast resources
spent on counterterrorism, governments may have neglected
low-probability, high-impact risks.65,66 This therefore constitutes a
critically underdeveloped area of research, for which there is likely
low-hanging fruit. Even if the humanitarian case for reducing
existential risk is clear, most policymakers will be responsible
primarily for the interests of a more limited constituency comprising
only the current generation and near future.\*\*\*\*\*\* It is therefore
instructive to evaluate how well these cost-effectiveness results hold
up when we largely ignore the benefits to future generations. We
therefore repeat the cost-effectiveness estimates with a discount rate
imposed on the benefits and costs borne in future years, and we find
that the merits of reducing existential risk still hold. If we ignore
distant future generations by discounting, the benefits of reducing
existential risk fall by between 3 and 5 orders of magnitude (with a 1%
to 5% discount rate), which is still far more cost-effective than
measures to reduce small-scale casualty events. Under our survey model
(Model 1), the cost per life-year varies between \$1,300 and \$52,000
for a 5% discount rate and between \$770 and \$30,000 for a 1% discount
rate. These costs are even competitive with first-world healthcare
spending, where typically anything less than \$100,000 per quality
adjusted life-year is considered a reasonable purchase.29 This suggests
that even if we are concerned about welfare only in the near term,
reducing existential risks from biotechnology is still a cost-effective
means of saving expected life if the future chance of an existential
risk is anything above 0.0001 per year. Our conservative models (with
much lower risk) suggest that existential risk prevention is not
cost-effective when compared to basic healthcare spending: Model 2
results in a cost per life-year between \$330,000 and \$16 million for a
5% discount rate and \$190,000 and \$9.7 million for a 1% discount rate,
while Model 3 results in a cost per life-year of between \$190,000 and
\$500,000 for a 5% discount rate and between \$110,000 and \$310,000 for
a 1% discount rate. These conservative numbers would suggest that
[healthcare spending is a better purchase than marginal biosecurity
funding, but even these numbers still support the notion that [we are
better off focusing on **low-probability, high-impact risks rather than
low-casualty**]{.mark} biosecurity **[risks]{.mark}**. For a biosecurity
portfolio, even [policy]{.mark} with limited time horizons [is]{.mark}
likely [better off investing in measures that **prevent the worst-case
scenarios**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Although the probability of human
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} from bioweapons [[may be **extremely
low**]{.underline}, [the expected value of reducing the
risk]{.underline} (**[even by a small amount]{.underline}**)
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} still [**[very large,]{.underline}** [since
such risks jeopardize the existence of **all future human
lives**]{.underline}]{.mark}. An initial attempt to estimate the
cost-effectiveness of reducing these risks finds that it takes likely
between 10 cents and 10s of dollars to save 1 life-year, [assuming we
value]{.underline} future [human lives]{.underline}. Although **[this
result is striking]{.underline}**, it is not unprecedented. Similar
analysis done by Matheny found that spending \$1 billion on an asteroid
deflection system would have a similar cost-effectiveness, at about
\$2.50 per life-year.29

### Risks of Lethal Arms Sales to Ukraine Vastly Outweigh Benefits

#### Significant risks of lethal arms sales to Ukraine outweigh their benefits. Absent lethal weapons, non-lethal aid will suffice.

In the end, [the [arguments against arming Ukraine are **stronger,**
from the point of view of]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[Ukraine
and]{.underline} [the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. First, [[providing lethal weapons runs
the **risk of inflaming a simmering conflict and igniting a proxy war**
between the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a region to which both Donald
Trump and Vladimir Putin have signaled it is the latter who has the
stronger commitment. Second, [[the **current level of strategic depth is
preserved** if the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [**[focuses on financial, political, and
technical aid]{.underline}**,]{.mark} keeping the option of arming
Ukraine open, and hinting that the option becomes more likely if Russia
escalates the conflict. Third, [[**lethal defensive weapons are not the
only way to increase the costs of a Russian military escalation**. Other
options include helping the Ukrainian armed forces prepare
fortifications and erect anti-tank barriers]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Finally, note that from the point of view of the Ukrainian electorate,
it is important that their elected officials continue asking for lethal
aid from the United States. Thus it is difficult to tell whether
Ukrainian elites truly believe lethal aid will help. For these reasons,
it may indeed be better for the U.S. to maintain its policy of not
sending lethal weapons to Ukraine, although the option should certainly
be kept open. Keeping the option on the table acts as a restraint
against further Russian aggression, since Russia fears that if it were
to escalate the fighting, the United States could respond by sending
arms to Ukraine. Providing lethal aid to Ukraine should be strongly
considered in the event of a Russian escalation in Ukraine.
