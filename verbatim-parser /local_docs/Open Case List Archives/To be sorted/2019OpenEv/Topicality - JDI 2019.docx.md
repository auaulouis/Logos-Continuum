**[Coaches and students, you're invited to discuss these topics in-depth
before casting your vote]{.underline}** online by October 15. See page

PROBLEM AREA I: ARMS SALES [Resolved: The United States federal
government should substantially reduce Direct Commercial Sales and/or
Foreign Military Sales of arms from the United States]{.underline}. In
the movie Iron Man, upon his triumphant return to the United States,
arms dealer Tony Stark reflects upon the world his products helped
shape: "I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to
defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a
system that is comfortable with zero-accountability...I had my eyes
opened. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just
making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am
shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries."
Just as Tony Stark faced his day of reckoning, the United States is on
the verge of facing a similar fate. President Trump is actively
increasing the number of arms contracts offered and authorized by the
United States. One must ask whether arms sales make us safer and
strengthen our economy, or create blowback which increases terrorism or
fuels conflicts in a variety of regions across the globe. Direct
Commercial Sales [affirmatives would limit the **number or type** of
sales by American companies to foreign militaries]{.underline}. These
[affirmatives could prohibit the sale of drone technology, reduce small
arms sold to nations like Saudi Arabia]{.underline} which are [used to
perpetrate human rights abuses, or strengthen export controls to
**prevent future** resale of our technology.]{.underline} Foreign
Military Sales affirmatives would reduce sales by the Departments of
State or Defense to foreign militaries. These [affirmatives could
prohibit sales of F-35s to Israel]{.underline} which are used for
bombing raids, [prevent Japanese acquisition of Tomahawk
missiles]{.underline} which would provoke China or North Korea, [or
prevent sales to Qatar]{.underline} which may give U.S. munitions to
terrorist organizations. Affirmatives addressing either type of sales
could net advantages such as: terrorism, proliferation, human rights
credibility, hegemony, and increasing stability in the world's most
volatile regions. Negative teams will have access to alliance-based
disadvantages highlighting the need for arms sales to create commonly
equipped militaries, defending arms sales as a credible deterrent to
prevent conflicts, acknowledging the economic impact of reducing the
role of one of the largest economic sectors, or arguing countries like
Russia or China would fill in and negate solvency. The only constant
element of President Trump's foreign policy is to increase arms sold by
the United States, which makes the literature base broad and accessible.
We have not embraced the opportunity to debate arms sales since 1983,
and the time to rekindle this debate is now.

#### The Topic Interpretation on the Ballot is the best interpretation. It reflects framers and voters intent on what the topic should mean. It provides reasonable prior notice on what negatives should be prepared to debate. It is bait and switch to have us vote for a topic telling us we could run affs like this and then afterward say the topic meant something else.

## General Description of DCS and FMS

**National Defense Industrial Association 19** Foreign Military Sales vs
Direct Commercial Sales,
<http://www.ndia.org/policy/international/fms-vs-dcs>, D.A. 6/1/19

FMS Process **[FMS]{.underline}** -- [an acquisition program
administered through the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency]{.underline} (DSCA[), with final approval by the State
Department]{.underline} -- supports security cooperation between the
U.S. and its allies. While [the U.S. government]{.underline} contracts
out to the defense industry on a competitive or sole-source basis, it
[may also sell directly from its own stockpiles]{.underline}. When
buying directly from the government's stockpiles, foreign customers will
have more leverage in the unit price of a defense system -- as these
same systems are also acquired by the U.S. military and defense
agencies. [For qualified FMS customers, the U.S. Congress provides
funding through foreign military financing]{.underline} (FMF).
Authorized by the State Department, and administered through DSCA, FMF
[funding is a non-repayable loan legally granted to strategic
countries]{.underline} -- most notably Israel, Egypt, Afghanistan, and
Iraq. While [FMS cases]{.underline} must have departmental approval,
they [are exempt from the export licensing process. Foreign customers
view the FMS process as more transparent, reliable, and
secure]{.underline}. [The U.S. government takes on more of the
contractual risk than the customer]{.underline} in the short run, and
supports the sustainment of the defense system in the long run. A
September 2016 White House approval of the sale of fighter jets to the
Middle East illustrates the impact that FMS has on the U.S. economy,
while concurrently serving U.S. national security interests.

DCS Process [DCS is regarded as a more flexible process, as the
purchaser consults directly with industry about specific products and
services it needs]{.underline}. Foreign customers leverage more
negotiating power regarding the type of contract (fixed price or firm
fixed price), how the contract is written, final delivery requirements,
and methods of payment. However, they must carry more risk and
administrative burdens. DCS has the added benefit of giving customers
options to purchase more non-standard systems that are mission specific,
and designed to tackle readiness challenges. In these cases, the
Pentagon does not support these types of mission requirements in their
stockpiles, or in their annual budget. [Qualifying for an export license
through DCS is based on how a product or service is categorized. The
State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls]{.underline}
(DDTC) [executes authority in issuing export licenses to all defense
related products and services on the U.S. Munitions List]{.underline}
(USML), [pursuant to the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations]{.underline} (ITAR). [The Department of Commerce's Bureau of
Industry and Security]{.underline} (BIS) [grants export licenses to more
commercial and "dual-use" defense products and services on the Commerce
Control List]{.underline} (CCL), pursuant to the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR). Like the FMS program, DCS advances interoperability
between the U.S military and its allies. Furthermore, [foreign countries
use FMF funding to purchase U.S. defense products and systems through
both the FMS program and,]{.underline} on occasion, [the DCS
process]{.underline}.

## Direct Commercial Sales

#### DCS is licensed commercial sales

**Johnson 98** Wayne M. Johnson Lieutenant Colonel, USAF Air War College
Maxwell Paper No. 16, Seller Beware US International Technology Transfer
and Its Impact On National Security MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE, ALABAMA
December 1998, http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/maxwell/mp16.pdf

[Direct commercial sales refers to commercial sales, under license,
directly to a foreign country, without the US procurement community
managing the program]{.underline}.

#### DCS only applies to weapons on the Munitions List

**Security Assistance Monitor 19** Center for International Policy,
https://securityassistance.org/content/direct%20commercial%20sales

Direct Commercial Sales

The Direct Commercial Sales program regulates U.S. companies\' sales of
U.S. defense articles and defense services on the U.S. Munitions List
abroad.

The State Department\'s Direct Commercial Sales (**[DCS)]{.underline}**
program **[regulates U.S. companies\' sales of U.S. defense articles and
defense services on the U.S. Munitions List abroad.]{.underline}**
Authorized under Sec. 2778 of U.S. Code, **[DCS is distinguished
from]{.underline}** the Foreign Military Sales (**[FMS) program, which
manages government-to-government sales]{.underline}** or transfers.
**[Unlike FMS, direct commercial sales are negotiated directly between
the foreign government and a U.S. company]{.underline}**. In the
overwhelming majority of cases, **[a U.S. company wanting to export U.S.
defense articles or defense services to a foreign country will require
an export license or approval from the State Department]{.underline}**.
Importantly, **[Security Assistance Monitor data shows approved license
agreements instead of actual deliveries of defense articles or services
to a foreign country each year. The license agreements often last a few
years]{.underline}**. Direct commercial sales are subject to the same
notification requirements as FMS. Foreign governments that have more
experience in military procurement, and do not feel a need to have the
U.S. government negotiate sales on their behalf, tend to choose DCS.
**[DCS is usually a quicker way to transfer arms abroad and has less
government oversight than FMS]{.underline}**. Each year, the State
Department\'s Directorate for Defense Trade Controls releases a report
detailing approved licenses and deliveries of defense articles and
defense services under DCS for the previous year.

#### DCS sales do not include the USFG in the sale

**LMDefense 19** Consulting Firm working with Defense Contractors,
<http://lmdefense.com/direct-commercial-sales/>

What differentiates Direct Commercial Sales (DCS)?

**[DCS means that the U.S. defense company]{.underline}** (the vendor)
**[works directly with the foreign government customer to negotiate,
finalize, and deliver a sale. The USG is not involved in the
sale]{.underline}** (although the vendor is required to comply with U.S.
regulations regarding military exports). **[Basically, DCS is any sale
not through the FMS]{.underline}**/FMF **[system]{.underline}**.

#### DCS are direct sales from businesses and are not controlled by the DOD

**Defense Acquisition University Glossary 19**

**[direct commercial sales]{.underline}**:

[Commercial exports of defense articles, services, and training licensed
under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), made by U.S. defense industry
directly to a foreign government. Direct Commercial Sales transactions
are not administered by DoD and do not normally include a
government-to-government agreement. The required U.S. Government
controls are implemented through licensing by the Department of
State]{.underline}.

#### The DCS Only plan is not perceived---there is no public perception of DCS Sales

Foundations, and Jeff Donarski of the Arms Sales Monitoring Project

Investigators and Activists
https://fas.org/asmp/library/handbook/WaysandMeans.html

Industry Direct Arms Sales [Direct commercial sales]{.underline} (DCS)
are negotiated by US companies and foreign buyers, without the
involvement of the Pentagon. These sales [must be approved by the State
Department]{.underline}\'s Office of Defense Trade Controls, through the
provision of an export license, and [they are subject to the same
congressional notification procedure as FMS.]{.underline} **[Most public
and policy attention focuses on FMS, since this program is much more
visible]{.underline}** and has accounted for the majority of US arms
exports over the years. But industry-direct shipments surpassed
government-negotiated transfers in 1989 and have been valued at several
billion dollars annually during the 1990s. In general, the choice of
whether to use the government-to-government channel or to deal directly
with the arms manufacturer is up to the purchasing country. The Pentagon
is technically neutral about which method foreign governments use to
make their purchases, although there are some weapons systems that the
Pentagon will not permit the industry to sell directly. The decision
about which route to use depends on several variables, including the
complexity of the equipment, the savvy and experience of the purchasing
government in negotiating complicated procurement contracts, the
customer\'s training and support needs, price, financing and delivery.
[The commercial route]{.underline} is usually quicker, sometimes cheaper
and [always entails less government oversight than do FMS.]{.underline}
In addition, [the State Department is much less transparent about DCS
than the Pentagon is about FMS. Minimal information about price and
quantity is classified as \"confidential business information\" and kept
from the public]{.underline}. This secrecy undermines the ability of
Congress and the interested press and public to exercise proper
oversight on industry-direct arms transfers. [The existence of these two
separate programs also makes gaining an accurate count of arms exports
in a given year exceedingly difficult]{.underline}. Delivery data for
commercial arms exports is gathered from shippers\' export documents
collected at ports of departure by the US Customs Service and eventually
passed along to the State Department. This process is cumbersome and
slow, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate tallies of exports.
Oftentimes governmental reports on the arms trade omit DCS exports
entirely, resulting in a significant undercounting of the U.S. share of
the market. US Market Share, 1989-1996 (all figures in thousands) Notes:
All figures are in current-year dollars, representing the value of
weapons delivered in that year. Industry export figures are for fiscal
years, while government-negotiated FMS and worldwide totals are for
calendar years. \*These figures still under-count total US exports by
omitting free transfers of surplus weaponry. \*\*This figure will
undoubtedly be revised upward in the coming year(s), as export data
trickles in. Sources: DSAA, Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Military

DCS [It is much more difficult to obtain information about DCS licensed
for export, or actually exported, than it is to track FMS]{.underline}.
[The State Department currently interprets a provision of the Export
Administration Act (Section 12(c)) as prohibiting it from disclosing any
information about items which it is licensing for export.]{.underline} A
1996 act of Congress requires that the State Department publish the
notices sent to Capitol Hill of proposed export licenses in the Federal
Register, the same as for FMS. The level of detail in these notices,
however, is very sparse comparatively. Moreover[, the State Department
usually delays publishing information on DCS until several weeks after
it has notified Congress of the proposed export license.]{.underline}
Some specialty publications, like the Arms Sales Monitor, record and
publicize these proposed licenses in \"real time\" when possible. To
find out how many of which types of weapons at what value the State
Department licensed for export to a particular country in the preceding
year, consult the State Department\'s annual \"Section 655\" report.
From this document it is possible to determine (for example) that the
State Department approved \$26.7 billion of munitions exports from US
industry to countries around the world in 1996. Using this report, one
can figure out how many assault rifles and grenade launchers (for
example) were authorized for sale to a particular destination, or to the
whole world. This document does not provide any information on actual
weapons deliveries, only export approvals. To determine the dollar value
of commercially-negotiated weapons deals actually delivered to a
particular country in each of the preceding ten years, see the DSAA\'s
annual report Foreign Military Sales Facts. [Sporadic congressional
hearings and internal State Department reports]{.underline} (usually by
the office of the Inspector General) [provide some additional
information on DCS. But if these sources don\'t give you what you are
looking for, you are probably out of luck.]{.underline} In most cases,
[requests under the Freedom of Information Act on industry-direct sales
authorized by the State Department will be unsuccessfu]{.underline}l,
unless you are prepared to file a law suit.

## Foreign Military Sales

#### FMS includes an offer or acceptance -- There is a formal contract 

**DSCA 19** Defense Security Contract Association,
<https://www.dsca.mil/programs/foreign-military-sales-fms>

Foreign Military Sales (FMS) [The Foreign Military Sales]{.underline}
(FMS) [program is a form of security assistance]{.underline} authorized
by the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as amended \[22 U.S.C. 2751, et.
seq.\] and a fundamental tool of U.S. foreign policy. Under Section 3,
of the AECA, [the U.S. may sell defense articles and services to foreign
countries and international organizations when the President formally
finds that to do so will strengthen the security of the U.S. and promote
world peace]{.underline}. [Under FMS, the U.S. Government and a foreign
government enter into a government-to-government agreement called a
Letter of Offer and Acceptance]{.underline} (LOA). Who: Secretary of
State determines which countries will have programs. Secretary of
Defense executes the program. [Funding: May be funded by country
national funds or U.S. Government funds]{.underline}.

#### FMS Sales are public and perceived

**Lumpe & Donarski 98** Lora Lumpe is advocacy director for security
sector governance in the Washington, D.C., office of the Open Society
Foundations, and Jeff Donarski of the Arms Sales Monitoring Project
Federation of American Scientists THE ARMS TRADE REVEALED: A Guide for
Investigators and Activists
https://fas.org/asmp/library/handbook/WaysandMeans.html

[Quite a lot is publicly knowable about FMS. The Pentagon publishes
press advisories about proposed sales on its Internet site
(www.defenselink.mil/news) at the same time that it notifies Congress of
its intention to offer a contract to a foreign government. This press
release usually discloses the weapon make and model, the principal
manufacturer, the quantity to be delivered and the price. A more
detailed version of the notice is published a few days later in the
Federal Register (also available on-line). This four-page notice
includes the official justification for the sale. Several specialty
publications and their associated web pages-such as Arms Control Today,
Arms Sales Monitor, Arms Trade News and Defense News-also report these
sales notifications. Even the mainstream press sometimes reports on
congressional notifications of major government-to-government
sales]{.underline}. Keep in mind that the preceding sources report on
potential sales-not on signed contracts. To find out how much (in dollar
terms) the US government actually contracted to sell and/or delivered to
a particular government in each of the preceding ten years consult
Foreign Military Sales Facts, published annually by the DSAA. This
report also provides aggregated data on FMS from 1950 onward. So, from
this source, you can find out that the US government has contracted to
sell \$284 billion of weapons to countries around the world since 1950.
You can also discover (for example) that in fiscal year 1996 the US
government sold Thailand more than \$500 million of arms. To find out
which specific weapons were delivered to a particular foreign government
through FMS in the previous fiscal year, look to a new annual report
prepared by the Defense and State Departments known as the \"Section
655\" report. (Section 655 of the Foreign Assistance Act mandates
preparation of the report.) From this document you can learn (for
example) that Israel took delivery of 4,698 rifles from the United
States in 1996. If none of these sources fills your particular
information need[, you can always file a specific request with the
Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act]{.underline} (see p. 112).
[The Pentagon is usually responsive to requests on FMS,]{.underline}
although specific data on quantities of weapons shipped abroad is
sometimes withheld (on alleged national security grounds). Quarterly
reports from the Pentagon to Congress which are required by the Arms
Export Control Act (Sections 25(a) and 36(a)) are another rich source of
information. We routinely file FOIA requests for these reports, which
cover a variety of arms sales activities.

## Other Means of Transfering Weapons---

### 

### Excess Defense Articles

#### Excess Defense Articles, leases and emergency drawdowns are not part of FMS or DCS---The aff can't topically prevent transfers through those programs

**Lumpe & Donarski 98** Lora Lumpe is advocacy director for security
sector governance in the Washington, D.C., office of the Open Society
Foundations, and Jeff Donarski of the Arms Sales Monitoring Project
Federation of American Scientists THE ARMS TRADE REVEALED: A Guide for
Investigators and Activists
https://fas.org/asmp/library/handbook/WaysandMeans.html

[The five principle (legal) means by which America exports weapons and
military services abroad are foreign military sales (FMS), direct
commercial sales (DCS**), leases of equipment, transfers of excess
defense articles (EDA) and emergency drawdowns of
weaponry**.]{.underline} To get the most accurate picture possible of US
weapons exports in a given year-to the whole world or to a particular
destination-you must compile transfers made through all of these
channels. Most arms deals begin with contact between a foreign
government and a US security assistance organization (SAO)-US military
personnel located in diplomatic posts and embassies abroad. SAOs help
foreign militaries define their needs, provide them with data on
American military equipment and function as the primary in-country point
of contact for US weapons contractors. These offices produce annual
military assistance assessments, which form the basis of the upcoming
year\'s military aid and arms sales programs. SAO personnel determine
which form of transfer best suits the recipient-sale, joint production
of the weapon, lease or grant transfer.

#### EDA is a separate legal authority from FMS and the DOD can use it to sell weapons or give them away

ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-443,
<https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/04-2010.pdf>

B. "Sales from Stock" and Grant Transfers of EDA [Two main authorities
allow for the transfer of EDA to foreign countries]{.underline}.71 [The
first authority is the FMS authority of]{.underline} section 21(a[),
AECA]{.underline}, Sales from Stocks.[72 This section authorizes the
sale of defense articles to eligible countries]{.underline} or
international organizations from existing DoD or Coast Guard stocks.73
Although FMS is a Department of State (DoS) security assistance program,
DoD operates FMS via DSCA.74 The owning military department is not
required to declare defense articles excess75 under section 21(a), since
this section authorizes the sale of both excess and nonexcess defense
articles.76 This article, however, focuses on EDA and will not address
sales of non-excess defense articles. In accordance with section 21(a),
countries are required to pay for EDA in U.S. dollars.77 The U.S.
Government depreciates EDA in accordance with the DoD Financial
Management Regulation, section 070304, and after depreciation, the
prices of EDA range from five to fifty percent of the original
acquisition value, depending on the condition and age of the article.78
Excess Defense Article sales use FMS procedures identified in the SAMM
and are processed using formal contracts or agreements between the U.S.
Government and the authorized purchaser[.]{.underline}79 [The second EDA
transfer authority is section 516, FAA, which provides for grant EDA
transfers to eligible]{.underline}80 [recipients on a no-cost
basis.]{.underline}81 [**Congress also authorized sales of EDA** under
section 516; however, EDA rarely executes sales under this
authority]{.underline}.82 Consequently, this primer will focus on
section 516 grant EDA transfers, rather than sales.

#### Transfer of EDA is not part of FMS or DCS

**Federation of American Scientists 8**

U.S. Arms Transfers: Government Data,
<https://fas.org/asmp/profiles/worldfms.html>

[American arms manufacturers have two major channels through which they
can sell major weaponry to foreign countries:]{.underline} foreign
military sales (\"[FMS\"]{.underline}), in which a
government-to-government agreement is negotiated by the Pentagon;
[and]{.underline} direct commercial sales (\"[DCS]{.underline}\"), in
which industry negotiates directly with the purchasing country and must
apply for a license from the State Department. [The United States
government **also transfers arms to other countries by giving away
weapons from U.S. military stocks for free or at greatly reduced prices,
classified as excess defense articles (EDA) or emergency
\"drawdowns**.\" The United States also provides military training to
many foreign countries. These transfers are also managed by the Defense
Department.]{.underline} For more information about types of U.S. arms
transfers, read the \"Ways and Means\" chapter of The Arms Trade
Revealed.

#### EDA can be used just like the FMS process to sell weapons from Afghan or Iraq stockpiles

ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-443,
<https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/04-2010.pdf>

D. Pseudo-Foreign Military Sales (FMS) in Iraq and Afghanistan
**[Pseudo-FMS]{.underline}** cases [refer to the purchase of defense
articles from existing DoD stocks under the authority of section 21,
AECA,]{.underline} Sales from Stock, as discussed in Subsection C above.
[These purchases are called pseudoFMS because the defense articles at
issue are purchased from Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) or
Iraqi Security Forces Fund]{.underline} (ISFF). The ASFF and ISFF are
U.S. appropriated funds used to train, equip, and maintain the
Afghanistan Security Forces and ISF, respectively.133 Defense articles
are sold in accordance with their fair market value,134 and even though
the defense articles are ultimately paid for with U.S. appropriated
funds, [the EDA transfer approval process remains substantially the same
as a grant or sale EDA purchase.]{.underline}

#### Trump is shifting to use of EDA now and it makes transfers faster

**Detsch 18** Jack Detsch is Al-Monitor's Pentagon correspondent. Based
in Washington, Detsch examines US-Middle East relations through the lens
of the Defense Department Pentagon sends surplus tanks to Morocco
https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/fa/contents/authors/jack-detsch.html#ixzz5rMmsV9Ph

**[The]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump administration greenlighted the
delivery of 162 Abrams tanks to Morocco]{.underline}** last year to help
the kingdom respond to regional challenges. US government documents
reviewed by Al-Monitor indicate that the delivery of the vehicles was
approved in September as part of an effort to move forward with deals to
outfit the North African nation with more than \$115 million in US
equipment the Pentagon no longer needs. **[Under the Excess Defense
Articles program]{.underline}**, or EDA, surplus **[military
equipment]{.underline}** that hasn't been offered to domestic police
forces **[can be made available at reduced or no cost to foreign
allies]{.underline}**. Deliveries of excess US military equipment to
Morocco have sped up in recent years, suggesting that **[the Pentagon
may see the program as an avenue to fast-track sales instead of relying
on other programs that require extensive approval from the
administration and Congress to go ahead]{.underline}**. The Moroccans
"get \$15 million a year in \[regular\] military aid from the US, so
\$100 million for one project is pretty massive," Seth Binder, an
analyst with Strategic Research and Analysis, a US-based consultancy,
told Al-Monitor. "**[People complain that the arms sales process is too
slow. I've been wondering if they use EDA if that process would speed
up]{.underline}**." Pentagon deals with Morocco that moved ahead under
the program during Trump's first year in office account for more than a
quarter of the **[\$430 million that the EDA program
implemented]{.underline}**, authorized or **[delivered to
the]{.underline}** entire **[Middle East]{.underline}**, according to an
Al-Monitor review of Department of Defense records. In addition to the
tanks, Rabat received tracked command post vehicles, grenade launchers
and howitzers as well as 419 armored personnel carriers. The deliveries
are part of US and European efforts to strengthen Morocco's military to
deal with drug-trafficking and terrorist networks that are proliferating
throughout North Africa as the Islamic State collapses in Iraq and
Syria. **[Morocco is the largest US weapons buyer in the Pentagon's
53-country Africa Command]{.underline}** and "has repeatedly
demonstrated the ability to operate and maintain advanced US equipment,"
according to a statement made by the Africa Command commander, Marine
Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, to Congress last month. The uptick in deliveries
of used weapons comes amid increasing congressional scrutiny of domestic
use of US surplus military equipment by police units following the 2014
protests in Ferguson, Missouri, that denounced law enforcement violence
against African-Americans. The Barack Obama administration banned
domestic deliveries of armored vehicles, .50 caliber ammunition and riot
equipment to local law enforcement the following year. **[The EDA
program could prove helpful to the Pentagon]{.underline}** as it leans
more heavily on foreign militaries to fight Islamist extremists as US
Defense Secretary James Mattis hones his focus on countering the
military threat from rising powers such as China and Russia. In the
fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, for instance, the
United States relies on advisers to assist partners such as the Iraqi
Security Forces and Syrian Democratic Forces. But as the Islamic State
dwindles, US troops rarely accompany their Iraqi counterparts on
missions, American commanders say. **[More excess defense equipment also
flowed to traditional American counterterrorism partners
in]{.underline}** 2017, including deliveries of M2 machine guns and

#### Empirically DOD has used Excess Defense Articles to get around arm sale restrictions

**Congressional Quarterly Almanac 70**

Arms Sales Bill Clears After Six-Month Deadlock An article from CQ
Almanac 1970,
<https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal70-1292048>

The subject of **[U.S. arms sales]{.underline}** to underdeveloped
nations **[became the subject of widespread controversy in
1967.]{.underline}** This attention centered particularly on the U.S.
Export-Import Bank\'s financing of credit arms sales to such countries
under a program operated by the Department of Defense. Under the plan,
the Bank was not told by the Pentagon which country was receiving the
loan. Although this program had not been a secret operation, few Members
of Congress were aware of its existence. When these activities were
publicized in 1967, the entire subject of U.S. arms sales was widely
discussed. As a result, the Export-Import Bank-Pentagon operation was
terminated and other sources of **[arms sales to underdeveloped
countries were curtailed by Congress]{.underline}** after considerable
debate. In order to continue the U.S.-financing of arms shipments
necessary for the defense of friendly less-developed countries, the
Johnson Administration in 1968 proposed separate credit arms sales to be
operated by the Defense Department. This plan was cleared by Congress in
1968 with little debate. No action was taken in 1969 on the
Administration\'s request for a \$275-million authorization for the
Foreign Military Sales program. Legislation extending the 1968
authorization was pending in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (S
2640) and the House Foreign Affairs Committee (HR 12863). The House in
1969 appropriated \$275 million for the program in its foreign
operations legislation (HR 15149) but the Senate Dec. 18 omitted the
appropriation from HR 15149 because no authorization had been passed.
But authorization for the program was continued temporarily through a
series of continuing resolutions. Back to Top House Committee Action
HEARINGS. The House Foreign Affairs Committee held hearings in February
on HR 15628, a bill to extend the Foreign Military Sales Act of 1968 (PL
90-629) for fiscal 1970 and 1971 and to authorize appropriations of
\$275 million and \$272.5 million for those years, as requested by the
Administration. Testimony Feb. 5 David Packard, Deputy Secretary of
Defense: The new Nixon Doctrine of relying on the nation directly
threatened to assume primary manpower responsibility for its defense
places the U.S. military assistance and arms sales programs in a special
position. To reduce U.S. overseas involvements and expenditures, "we
must continue, if requested, to give or sell them the tools they need
for this bigger load we are urging them to assume. That is why, in the
interest of maintaining an adequate defense posture at minimum cost, the
growing use of credit-assisted sales of military equipment, as well as
increased MAP (military assistance programs), seem clearly indicated for
the immediate future." Several countries have based defense
modernization plans on the availability of U.S. credit, and failure to
make this assistance available would disrupt these plans, which the
United States has encouraged. Such sales are rigidly controlled to avoid
increasing local tension and arms races and to sell only what the
recipient countries need and can afford. The Administration proposes an
amendment to HR 15628 to broaden the President\'s ability to waive a
prohibition on sales credits or guarantees to countries that seize, take
into custody or fine American fishing vessels if he finds it important
to the security of the United States. U. Alexis Johnson, Under Secretary
of State for political affairs: The Foreign Military Sales Act program
is regarded as an important instrument of foreign policy which has been
used with care. Without it many countries would turn to other arms
suppliers, and some countries which have predominantly U.S. equipment
would face replacement difficulties and increased costs. The ability of
the United States to exercise some moderating influence on the size of
arms purchases would also be reduced. "Despite pressures from many
directions, we have not promoted nor encouraged military sales simply
because these would help to meet our export expansion targets and
benefit our balance of payments. We are one of the very few arms
producing nations which can make this claim." REPORT. The House Foreign
Affairs Committee March 5 reported HR 15628 (H Rept 91-869) authorizing
\$275 million for fiscal 1970 and \$272.5 million for fiscal 1971 and
1972. Provisions. As reported, HR 15628: Authorized appropriations of
\$275 million for fiscal 1970 and \$272.5 million in fiscal years 1971
and 1972 (compared to \$296 million in fiscal 1969). Established a
foreign military sales credit ceiling of \$350 million in fiscal year
1970 and \$385 million in each of fiscal years 1971 and 1972. Restricted
sales to Latin American and African countries by (1) making the fiscal
1969 ceiling of \$75 million for Latin American countries a continuing
ceiling applicable in each fiscal year; and (2) making the fiscal 1969
ceiling of \$40 million for African countries a continuing ceiling
applicable in each fiscal year. Added to an existing prohibition on
sales and guaranties a Committee amendment that sales and guaranties
under the Act "shall not be approved when they would have the effect of
arming military dictators who are denying the growth of fundamental
rights or social progress to their own people." Added a new section
expressing the sense of Congress that the President should negotiate
with the Soviet Union and other powers a limitation on arms shipments to
the Middle East, and declaring that the President should be supported in
his position that arms would be made available and credits provided to
Israel and other friendly states to the extent he deemed necessary in
order for such states to meet threats to their security. Amended section
3 (b) of the Act which prohibited the sale of defense articles and
services to countries which seized American fishing vessels in
international waters by substituting clarifying language, by specifying
that the period of ineligibility for sales would be one year after each
unlawful seizure, in lieu of an indefinite cutoff and by authorizing the
President to waive the restriction when he received reasonable
assurances from the country involved that future violations would not
occur. Committee Views. The report stated that there was a continuing
requirement for a foreign military sales program because it served U.S.
national security interests and was an important instrument of U.S.
foreign policy. The Committee said it considered extension of the
authorization through fiscal 1972 to be desirable but said it would
consider a supplemental authorization request if the authorization was
insufficient or the aggregate ceiling was too low. The report noted that
total military sales for fiscal 1970 were estimated to be
\$1,898,200,000, of which \$990,400,000 would be made by the Department
of Defense for cash, \$557,800,000 would be sold through commercial
channels by U.S. suppliers, and \$350 million would be U.S.-financed
credit. Total sales for 1971 were estimated to be slightly
higher---\$1,974,500,000, of which \$385 million would be sold through
U.S.-financed credit. Referring to the Administration\'s policy of
reducing direct U.S. military involvement overseas, the Committee
stated. "The military sales program encourages the countries of the free
world to make a greater contribution in providing for their own
security." The report stated that discontinuing the sales program would
necessitate an increase in the military assistance grant program or
would cause nations to seek weapons from other sources. Faced with a
continuing Communist threat, the Committee concluded, U.S. policy should
aim to improve the defense capabilities of forward defense countries at
the Communist periphery (Greece, Turkey, South Korea and Nationalist
China) and should support the concept of collective security so that
free-world nations could provide more effectively for their own defense.
Floor Action The House by a 351-26 roll-call vote March 24 passed HR
15628 and sent it to the Senate after accepting a minor amendment. (Vote
33, p. 12-H) Debate. Urging passage of the bill, Thomas E. Morgan (D
Pa.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that
military sales "to selected countries on a controlled basis" served U.S.
national security interests and was an important instrument of U.S.
foreign policy. "The shift from military grant aid to foreign military
sales has been one of the most encouraging aspects of our foreign
assistance programs," he said. "A sound, adequate and coordinated
military assistance and sales program may help hasten the time when the
free nations of the world will be able to defend themselves without the
presence of U.S. forces." Objecting to the bill, H. R. Gross (R Iowa)
queried: "What kind of business is this? How incongruous can you get
when you establish over in the Pentagon a superduper arms sales agency
and then hold meetings around the world for the purported purpose of
disarming? How contradictory, how paradoxical can you get? I see no
reason for this legislation." A number of Members spoke on the need to
provide Israel with additional arms and were critical of the
Administration\'s March 23 decision to defer the Israeli request for
additional Skyhawk and Phantom jets. R. Lawrence Coughlin (R Pa.)
offered an amendment requesting the President to review the military
assistance and sales programs and initiate discussions with other
nations on controlling the arms trade. The amendment was similar to a
resolution (H Res 735) introduced in December 1969 and cosponsored by a
bipartisan group of 30 Representatives. It was adopted on a voice vote.
Coughlin said the amendment was not intended to curb the supply of arms
for self-defense to allies such as Israel and West Germany, but was
"aimed at the oversupplying of arms, particularly to the developing
nations. This oversupplying of arms can and has led to military
adventures that could result in the outbreak of a serious war." Coughlin
noted that there had been 56 wars "of significant size" since 1945, 54
of which had been fought in the underdeveloped areas of the world. The
worldwide annual volume of arms trade had doubled in 15 years, he said,
and now was put at \$5 billion. "It is estimated that the trade will
double again to \$10 billion a year within the next decade....The United
States is the world\'s largest arms merchant, distributing in excess of
\$2 billion worth of weapons per year to some 70 countries. The Soviets
sell approximately \$1 billion per year, Britain and France sell another
\$1 billion between them, and some 20 other countries divide up the rest
of the business." Coughlin said a recent Defense Department report
showed "such surprising things" as the fact that the United States was
still selling arms to South Africa "in contravention of our own arms
embargo; that we are still selling arms to the United Arab Republic;
that our arms aid to Greece in 1969 was 40 percent more than in the
previous six years; and that arms aid to such countries as El Salvador,
Chile and Morocco was skyrocketing." Provisions. As passed by the House,
HR 15628: Authorized appropriations of \$275 million for fiscal 1970 and
\$272.5 million in fiscal years 1971 and 1972. Established a foreign
military sales credit ceiling of \$350 million in fiscal year 1970 and
\$385 million in each of fiscal years 1971 and 1972. Restricted sales to
Latin American and African countries by (1) making the fiscal 1969
ceiling of \$75 million for Latin American countries a continuing
ceiling applicable in each fiscal year; and (2) making the fiscal 1969
ceiling of \$40 million for African countries a continuing ceiling
applicable in each fiscal year. Broadened the existing prohibition on
sales and guaranties to dictators who "deny social progress to their own
people" to include those who "deny the growth of fundamental rights" to
their own people. Expressed the sense of Congress that the President
should negotiate with the Soviet Union and other powers a limitation on
arms shipments to the Middle East, and declared that the President
should be supported in his position that arms would be made available
and credits provided to Israel and other friendly states to the extent
he deemed necessary in order for such states to meet threats to their
security. Urged the President to request supplemental appropriations for
this purpose if necessary. Amended section 3 (b) of the Act, which
prohibited the sale of defense articles and services to countries which
seized American fishing vessels in international waters, by substituting
clarifying language specifying that the period of ineligibility for
sales would be one year after each unlawful seizure, in lieu of an
indefinite cutoff, and by authorizing the President to waive the
restriction when he received reasonable assurances from the country
involved that future violations would not occur. Administration had
requested the provision. Expressed the sense of Congress that the
President should immediately institute a thorough and comprehensive
review of the military aid programs and take such actions as may be
appropriate to initiate multilateral discussions with the Soviet Union
and West European countries on the control of worldwide trade in
armaments, begin general debate in the United Nations on controlling
conventional arms trade, and use the prestige of his office to signify
the U.S. intention to work actively with all nations to check and
control the international sales and distribution of conventional
weapons. Amendment Accepted March 24---R. Lawrence Coughlin (R
Pa.)---Request the President to review U.S. military assistance and
sales programs and initiate discussions with other nations on
controlling the worldwide traffic in arms. Voice vote. Back to Top
Senate Committee Action HEARINGS. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
held hearings March 24 and May 11 on bills (HR 15628, S 2640, S 3429) to
extend or amend the foreign military sales program. In the interval
between the two hearing dates, the country was plunged into intense
controversy in the after-math of the entry of U.S. troops into Cambodia
April 30. Following the military move, a major national debate erupted
in Congress, the public, the press and on college campuses. (Box p.
930--931) Reacting to the Cambodian incursion, a group of dovish
Senators decided to use the pending military sales bill as a vehicle for
debating amendments to curb the Indochinese conflict. Four senior
members of the Foreign Relations Committee, George D. Aiken (R Vt.),
Frank Church (D Idaho), John Sherman Cooper (R Ky.) and Mike Mansfield
(D Mont.), announced plans to sponsor an amendment barring the
introduction into Cambodia of any American defense articles, instructors
or advisers. The proposal, which became known as the Cooper-Church
amendment, was similar to one offered by the two Senators to the Defense
Appropriations bill (PL 91-171) in 1969. That provision, enacted into
law with the appropriations, prohibited the introduction of U.S. ground
combat troops into Laos and Thailand. (1969 Almanac p. 461) Testimony
March 24 Deputy Secretary of Defense Packard and Under Secretary of
State U. Alexis Johnson appeared before the Committee and presented
statements similar to those they had given previously before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. (Above) Commenting on testimony by Packard
that U.S. arms sales were also based on economic considerations and were
not intended to adversely affect a country\'s pace of economic
development, Committee Chairman Fulbright said he "could not think of a
worse way to do so than to make it easy for (developing countries) to
buy bigger and better armaments." Fulbright also asked about reports
that Turkey was planning to transfer 100 U.S. tanks to Pakistan after
the United States had replaced the tanks with newer ones. Fulbright said
that would be an "underhanded sort of way" to evade the U.S. arms
embargo of India and Pakistan. Johnson replied that the proposal was
under consideration, but no decision had been reached. Fulbright asked
about the Administration\'s position on an amendment offered by L.
Mendel Rivers (D S.C.) and adopted by the House March 23 on submarines
for Taiwan in the Naval vessel loan program (HR 15728). Johnson replied
that the addition "should be considered within the totality of the
program rather than in isolation." He did not comment further. May 11
Opening witnesses were Senators Church and Cooper, cosponsors of the
amendment to limit U.S. involvement in Cambodia by cutting off funds for
U.S. military operations. They were followed by Thomas R. Pickering,
deputy director, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, Department of
State and Lt. Gen. Robert H. Warren U.S. Air Force, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense for military assistance and sales, Department of
Defense. Church: The amendment "would draw the purse strings tight
against a deepening American involvement in Cambodia." The precedent for
the amendment "lies in the action taken last December when...the Senate
adopted overwhelmingly a modification I proposed to an amendment offered
by Senators Cooper and (Mike) Mansfield (D Mont.) to the military
appropriations bill for fiscal year 1970. It provided that 'none of the
funds authorized by this Act shall be used to finance the introduction
of American ground combat troops into Laos or Thailand.' There is reason
to believe that this amendment, which became law, had a restraining
effect on our newest venture, because the President is said to have
rejected recommendations that the current operation include Laos as well
as Cambodia. "We seek to do for Cambodia what our earlier amendment did
for Laos. But since American forces have already entered Cambodia, the
amendment we propose would set limits on their intervention, prevent
them from remaining in Cambodia, and preclude any military entanglement
on our part with the government of that country." Cooper: "There are two
chief purposes of the amendment. The first...is to ensure through the
denial of funds to the Executive Branch, that the present military
operation in Cambodia shall not be extended into a war in support of
Cambodia, the present government or any other government, or support of
any Cambodian forces....The second purpose...is to protect against the
danger that the continuing presence of United States forces in Cambodia
may expand the Vietnam war into a new theatre---Cambodia." Following
testimony by Cooper and Church, the Committee questioned Pickering and
Warren on the military sales program and disposal of excess military
equipment. Stuart Symington (D Mo.): Does the State Department consider
it is "free to give excess military equipment to Cambodia without
Congressional authority?" Pickering: It can do it on Presidential
authority. Symington: Last year, in its presentation to Congress, [th**e
Defense Department said it would give \$341,000 in excess military
equipment to Taiwan**]{.underline} in fiscal 1970. In fact, **[with the
delivery of F-100s and F-104 fighters from the Department\'s excess
stocks, the Republic of China actually received \$144 million in
military equipment.]{.underline}** Would the Defense Department
acknowledge that the F-104 and F-100 are still excellent planes and not
obsolete? Warren: Yes, it\'s a good plane. Symington: In fact, it is a
better and newer plane than is available to our Air Force National Guard
units. **[Church]{.underline}**: **[In other words, Congress in the past
has attempted to reduce the military assistance program and the Defence
Department has circumvented this intent by declaring equipment excess
and then giving it away.]{.underline}** Symington: What control is there
that military supplies given under the Military Assistance Program or
the Foreign Military Sales program cannot be transferred to third
countries by the recipient country? Warren: The law is against it.
Clifford P. Case (R N.J.): Excess military equipment is very
significant. With the Vietnam war ending, sooner or later there is going
to be piles of it. **[Symington: Is it fair to say that by declaring any
equipment obsolete or excess you can give that away without coming back
to Congress? Warren: Yes]{.underline}**, to any country eligible for
grant aid under the Military Assistance Program. Symington: What about
other countries? Warren: **[If the President issued a "determination"
that it was essential for national security]{.underline}**, "yes **[he
could do it."]{.underline}** **[Symington: "Then there\'s no limit at
all on what he could give. He could declare the whole Defense Department
excess and give it away. "The easiest way to give something away is to
purchase it and then declare it excess]{.underline}**---the TFX series
of planes could be an example, but who would take it?" **[Fulbright:
Would it be possible for the President to give Cambodia arms without
seeking Congressional approval? Warren: Yes]{.underline}**, if money
were available under the Foreign Assistance Act or the Foreign Military
Sales program. He would have to notify Congress, but **[he could do it
without Congressional approval]{.underline}**.

and to provide them to MAP without congressional funding

"excess defense articles" and "DOD excesses" are not

terms of dollar value, [which are classified under these regulations as
excess defense articles are not, in fact]{.underline}, in
[excess]{.underline} of DOD inventory retention requirements. Pursuant
to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, excess defense
articles may be transferred to foreign countries without specific
funding authority under MAP appropriations. The act defines: \--"Excess
defense articles" as those defense articles owned by the U.S. Government
which are in excess of the mobilization reserve and which are not
procured in anticipation of military assistance or sales requirements.
\--"Mobilization reserve" as those defense articles determined to be
required under regulations prescribed by the President to support the
mobilization of the U.S. Armed Forces in the event of war or national
emergency. [The President's authority to prescribe such regulations has
been delegated to the Secretary of Defense by executive order ;
therefore, the decision rests entirely with DOD as to what portion of

This report shows that [DOD derives wide latitude from the Foreign
Assistance Act in determining what articles qualify]{.underline} for
nonreimbursable transfers [as excess defense articles and that most of
the articles thus classified by DOD are, in fact, not excess by

provided an incomplete accounting of the use of excess defense articles
and other forms of military assistance. [The magnitude of U.S. military
assistance to foreign countries is not readily apparent to anyone,

assistance can flow to foreign recipients through several

from the Congress. [The use of excess defense articles is one
such\'pipeline]{.underline}. Our report shows that [excess articles are
continuously available in vast quantities and have been used in military
assistance programs since the inception of foreign aid]{.underline}.
Since 1968 DOD has taken advantage of the increased availability of
excess articles resulting from the Vietnam conflict to supplement
reduced MAP appropriations by providing military assistance in addition
to that funded under the regular MAP, not by reducing the annual cost of
MAP.

**Stratfor 18** Stratfor is the world's leading geopolitical

https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/egypt-goes-arms-spending-spree

Military necessity, however, does not lie at the root of the increase in
Egyptian arms purchases. Although the country is embroiled in a
difficult counterinsurgency against Islamists in the Sinai Peninsula,
most of its recent purchases, including surface-to-air missiles and
major warships, are completely unsuited to Sinai fighting. In fact, few
of the recent arms deals address the army\'s needs in the Sinai, where
Egyptian troops are largely waging a campaign with pre-existing
capabilities and equipment. If anything, Egyptian forces fighting on the
peninsula have suffered from a lack of resources. To a great extent, the
Egyptian infantry conducting a majority of the fighting in the Sinai
lacks advanced body armor and individual fighting gear amid a wider
dearth of effective equipment, training and supplies. In terms of
vehicles, the army has deployed older and more vulnerable M-60A3 tanks
on the peninsula, while its more advanced --- and much better protected
--- M1 Abrams tanks have remained outside the theater. Coincidentally,
**[Egypt]{.underline}** didn\'t even buy some of the equipment that is
most suited to its battle in the Sinai, **[the mine-resistant,
ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles. Instead, the United States began
giving hundreds of them to Cairo free of charge in early 2016 as part of

militaries]{.underline}. [The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the
Pentagon to lend weapons out]{.underline}, as long as the Defense
Department guarantees that the articles are not required for use by U.S.
military or civilian agencies for the duration of the lease. Typical
reasons for leasing are to provide a weapon for testing purposes[; to
allow the Pentagon to respond to an \"urgent\" foreign requirement while
still retaining ownership of the equipment]{.underline} as a hedge
against possible future needs; or to provide equipment on the cheap when
the recipient cannot afford to purchase the weapons outright. [The
customer pays a rental charge which equals the depreciation of the
equipment during the lease]{.underline}. [Government-negotiated leases
are sealed with a contract (called an LOA), the same as
government-negotiated sales]{.underline}. The LOA covers costs incurred
in upgrading or conditioning the equipment, delivery, training and
restoration or replacement if the weapon is damaged. Leases run for a
fixed period, capped at five years, but they can be renewed. The US
government maintains title for the leased weaponry, and the Defense
Department may terminate a lease and require the immediate return of the
equipment at any time. The Pentagon must notify Congress of any weapons
lease that will run for more than a year, as well as any lease
surpassing the \$14 million threshold established for notification of
FMS and DCS. [The widespread use of leasing also leads to undercounting
U.S. arms exports, since dollar-based determinations of the arms trade
count only the rent, as opposed to the value of the weapon being
transferred.]{.underline} In recent years, the value of weaponry being
leased to countries around the world has doubled-from \$300 million in
1994 to nearly \$700 million in 1996. Since most leases run for several
years, it is reasonable to assume [that the United States currently has
well over one billion dollars worth of lethal equipment on loan to
foreign militaries]{.underline}.

[The five principle (legal) means by which America exports weapons and
military services abroad are foreign military sales (FMS), direct
commercial sales (DCS**), leases of equipment, transfers of excess
defense articles (EDA) and emergency drawdowns of
weaponry**.]{.underline} To get the most accurate picture possible of US
weapons exports in a given year-to the whole world or to a particular
destination-you must compile transfers made through all of these
channels. Most arms deals begin with contact between a foreign
government and a US security assistance organization (SAO)-US military
personnel located in diplomatic posts and embassies abroad. SAOs help
foreign militaries define their needs, provide them with data on
American military equipment and function as the primary in-country point
of contact for US weapons contractors. These offices produce annual
military assistance assessments, which form the basis of the upcoming
year\'s military aid and arms sales programs. SAO personnel determine
which form of transfer best suits the recipient-sale, joint production
of the weapon, lease or grant transfer.

Generally, ships and naval craft are classified as either mobilization
reserve or excess. The mobilization reserve includes all ships and
craft, both active and inactive, listed on the Naval Vessel Register and
those on loan or lease to foreign countries. We were told [that loaning
or leasing ships and craft to foreign countries is frequently preferable
to storing them because it is less expensive]{.underline}. As a part of
the mobilization reserve, however, ships on loan are maintained on the
register and are considered to be available to the United States if they
are needed. Ships which are no longer required for mobilization are
stricken from the register and become excess. These ships may be offered
to MAP, sold under the Foreign Military Sales Act, or otherwise disposed
of in accordance with DOD disposal procedures. Ship loans and leases are
covered in detail in chapter 9. [Aircraft are similarly retained to meet
operational requirements or are stored for future needs]{.underline}.
Aircraft which exceed operational and storage requirements are declared
excess and, as in 'the case of ships and craft, may be offered to MAP,
sold under the Foreign Military Sales Act, or otherwise disposed of.
Aircraft are generally declared excess after semiannual reviews of
storage aircraft that consider future needs, replacement requirements,
and the condition of the aircraft.

article within the same foreign country, or reexports, which involve

### Covert Transfers

#### The president can use covert arms transfers to circumvent 

**Waltz 7** Susan Waltz Professorof Public Policy at Gerald R. Ford
School of Public Policy University of Michigan US Policy on Small Arms
Transfers: A Human Rights Perspective,
<https://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/workingpapers/2007/43-waltz-2007_rev.pdf>

As comprehensive as it appears to be, the presentation of US small arms
transfer policy publicized by State Department websites is incomplete.
What is missing? In a nutshell, the policy outlined above excludes
discussion of lawful but covert, undisclosed, incompletely monitored or
unregistered transfers. [Weapons supplied under the terms of what can be
called a "shadow policy"]{.underline} account for a fraction of all US
weapons transfers, but in the context of the War on Terror they [have
come to represent a substantial portion of the US transfers of small
arms and light weapons]{.underline}. Based on the US government's own
reports, the value of unregistered small arms and light weapons supplied
to Iraq alone during the 2003-2005 period exceeds the value of all such
weapons transferred through foreign military sales from 1997-2002.60
Because these weapons are so easily diverted to the black market they
represent some of the most problematic weapons in circulation. They also
give rise to the most serious contradictions in US small arms policy.
Analysts and small arms control advocates have wrestled with the knotty
question of how to describe and assess transfers that do not seem to fit
within the bounds of the publicly espoused policy. [Covert
transactions]{.underline} of questionable nature [are sometimes called
"gray market transfers]{.underline}" and considered illicit at best.
(See box.) [Other transactions -- such as the weapons recently procured
for Iraq]{.underline}---are not clandestine but nevertheless appear to
[fall outside common categories of grant or sale]{.underline}.
Discussions and analyses that treat such transactions as exceptional or
illicit are problematic inasmuch as they imply that some transfers are
not covered by law or policy[. In fact, the covert and unsupervised
supply of weapons is not an exception to US policy; over the past sixty
years it has been an integral component of the policy.]{.underline}
Excluding such transactions from analysis, or treating them as a
category apart, deflects attention from the laws, oversight mechanisms,
and programs that constitute a crucial element of US small arms transfer
policy. To complete the analysis of existing policy, a fifth prong,
acknowledging shadow transfers, must be added to the framework outlined
in the 2006 CRS report. As with other aspects of US policy, the shadow
policy on small arms is shaped by law, implemented through government
programs, and subject to Congressional budget approval and oversight. As
already noted, the most robust and stringent provisions of law apply to
commercial transactions vetted and approved through the State Department
and the Department of Commerce. [Shadow transactions are generally
completed under other legal provisions, in particular the Foreign
Assistance Act (FAA) and the 1947 National Security Act. The FAA
establishes the legal framework for weapons furnished to other countries
on a grant basis. It also provides the president with authority to draw
down US defense stocks on an emergency basis, including weapons acquired
abroad, for antiterrorism assistance, narcotics control and other
designated purposes]{.underline}. In theory, all US government
transfers, whether accomplished by grant or by sale, are subject to
statutes that require assurance that the recipient will use the weapons
only for intended purpose, and that subsequent transfer or resale of the
weapons is contingent on US approval. In the past, such
transfers---overseen by the Department of State\--were considered to
receive considerable scrutiny. [In current practice]{.underline},
however, some [weapons supplied via grant programs may be subject to
minimal or no scrutiny, particularly if the weapons in question are not
US-manufactured.]{.underline} DoD procedures, as a case in point, assert
continuing US responsibility for the proper use of weapons provided to
other countries, but only if they are of US-origin.61 As discussed
below, programs authorized via the mechanism of national defense and
emergency supplemental authorization bills in the aftermath of September
11 also lend themselves to shadow transfers, in part via provisions that
suspend constraints imposed by the FAA. Covert actions provide a
separate legal channel for shadow transfers. The statutory underpinnings
for such operations, including weapons transfers, are found in the
National Security Act, incorporated into Title 50 of the US Code under
the heading of War and National Defense. (The Arms Export Control Act
and the Foreign Assistance Act, by contrast, are included in Title 22,
Foreign Relations.) Title 50 provisions make it lawful for the US
Government to engage in activities "to influence political, economic, or
military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the
United States Government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly"
and distinguishes such actions from traditional law enforcement,
intelligence and military activities, and from traditional diplomatic
practice. Sub-chapter III (§415) of Title 50 anticipates that some of
these activities may involve transfer of "defense articles and defense
services" as defined by the US Munitions List. As noted above, this list
includes virtually all small arms and light weapons. The 1947 statute
has periodically been modified, and a US president authorizing a covert
operation today must be mindful of several constraints. Most
importantly, actions cannot be taken in violation of the US
Constitution, US statutes or express Congressional prohibition. Since
1974 the president has been formally required to report all covert
operations to Congress; since 1991 he has been required to issue a
written "finding" confirming that each such operation is necessary to
support identifiable foreign policy objectives and is important to the
national security.62 The law further stipulates that all intelligence
agencies involved in a planned action must be identified, and Congress
must be informed before the intended action commences. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that strict legal requirements may have resulted in
fewer formally declared covert actions, but not necessarily fewer
transactions in the shadows. 63 After consulting with State Department
lawyers about the finer points of law in his efforts to find means of
supplying weapons to the Bosnians, US diplomat Richard Holbrooke is
reported to have summarized the constraints as a progression:
...\[S\]uggesting to a foreign country that it might consider a covert
action appeared perfectly legal; going one step further and encouraging
a foreign country appeared legal but potentially risky from a political
standpoint. Actually supporting the foreign action through direct
participation, the reports said, crosses the line into covert action.
\[Italics added for emphasis.\]64 The legal reforms seem principally to
have inspired clever interpretations and innovative policy
"workarounds." In any event, the legal constraints appear not to have
had great practical or political effect. [Not only are numerous
workarounds available to a determined president or his aides, but
Congressional commitment to oversight has been ambivalent]{.underline},
at very least. In the first place, Congressional authority is limited.
Statutes (enacted by Congress) entitle the legislature to appropriate
information but they also assert very clearly that covert actions are
not subject to Congressional approval. Secondly, Congress has not found
political will to impose meaningful constraints on the executive. In the
face of executive excess, Congress has episodically expressed outrage
and threatened to exercise muscle, but for the most part legislators
have appeared content to settle for inclusion in the information loop
via select committees on intelligence. These committees steward
Congress' statutory right to be notified when defense items with
aggregate value in excess of \$1 million are transferred beyond control
of the US government by any intelligence agency in a given fiscal year.
It is unclear, though, whether such oversight authority or potentially
significant budget authority results in fewer arms transfers. In some
cases it may be that consultations with Congress (or even the specter of
consultations with Congress) work to cancel or curtail ill-advised
plans.65 In other cases, [members of Congress may actually use their
authority and privileged knowledge to increase authorized funding for
arms transfers]{.underline}. Such was the case with Charlie Wilson
(D-Texas), who infamously used his powers as a member of the
Appropriations Defense Sub-Committee to significantly augment funds for
covert small arms transfers to Afghanistan. Less subtly, Congress in
1994 specifically instructed the US government not to enforce an arms
embargo on Bosnia. In 1998 it went yet further, authorizing nearly \$100
million in military assistance (including weapons) to bolster a flagging
White House initiative to assist Iraqi dissidents in their efforts to
remove Saddam Hussein from power in 66 Iraq. The instruments used by the
US to implement the shadow policy have evolved considerably over the
past six decades. During the height of the Cold War, the US depended
primarily on the Central Intelligence Agency to carry out covert
actions, including provision of weapons and the money to procure them.
After a number of failed operations and Congress inquiries in the
1970's, however, covert operations were made subject to somewhat greater
scrutiny and became more cumbersome as a tool of secretive presidential
policy. [The complexity of the US intelligence community---today
comprised of sixteen separate agencies---now offers the executive some
choice in carrying out shadow operations, including secret arms
transfers]{.underline}. While the CIA remains the best known of the
intelligence agencies, the Pentagon currently h much more extensive
intelligence network and today accounts for the great bulk of national
intelligence funding.67 Over time, Presidents and their advisors have
been inventive in their use of government resources and agencies, as
well as outside actors, to deliver various aspects of the shadow policy.
To stay within the bounds of law (and circumvent Congress), for example,
the Reagan Administration turned to members of its National Security
Council to carry out the Iran Co project---which involved surreptitious
supply of weapons to both Iran and the Nicaraguan Contras. Although the
Boland Amendment explicitly forbid using appropriated funds and engaging
US intelligence agencies to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, NSC
conspirator secretly sold US weapons to Iran and diverted the proceeds
to arm the Contras.68 In the same period, the US persuaded Saudi Arabia
to pay for millions of AK-47 assault rifles and other light weapons to
be channeled to the Afghan mujahideen through Pakistani intelligence
services.69 During the 1990's covert supplies to Bosnia-Hersegovina
appear to have involved the US Force in some measure, and possibly US
Special Forces under control of the Pentagon. According to the Dutch
government's 2002 report on the massacre at Srebrenica, it is not clear
what nation's pilots flew the Hercules C-130 cargo planes that ferried
ammunition, machine g Stingers and other light weaponry on "black
flights to Tuzla" in clear violation of a UN arms embargo, but the
success of those flights definitely required aversion of AWAC
surveillance under US control.70 Ten years later, Bosnia was faced with
the challenge of disposing of its wartime stocks of light weaponry, and
recent reports from Amnesty International suggest that at least some of
them were authorized by US military officers serving under NATO auspices
for transfer to Rwanda and Iraq.71 Yet more recently, questions have
been raised about US covert activities in Somalia, under a UN arms
embargo since 1992. Sizable payments by CIA agents financed illicit
weapons that fueled open hostilities in 2006.72 Stories circulating in
2007 further suggest that the US with Saudi Arabia has clandestinely
armed Fatah al-Islam in Lebanon.73 As intimated, the features of a
shadow transfer may vary according to circumstances. Some involve covert
operations; some do not. [Several programs created in conjunction with
the war on terror appear to lend themselves to shadow transfers even if
they do not extend from formally declared covert
operations]{.underline}. The first is a military training program known
as "[Section 1206" training, which permits the Pentagon to train and
equip foreign military personnel]{.underline} without going through the
State Department's normal screening procedures.74 As detailed in
administration budget requests, the "Global Train and Equip" program
includes the supply of small arms and light weapons to partners in the
war on terror whose human rights record, risks for diversion, or other
concerns might make them ineligible for assistance under the
Conventional Arms Transfer guidelines.75 Given the attenuation of normal
State Department vetting procedures and limited opportunity for
Congressional review, it is doubtful that such transfers are subject to
the full set of cradle-to-grave oversight measures outlined in the
principled policy. It is even less likely that accountability is
established for any weapons transferred or purchased u the authority of
a second program, known as Coalition Support Funds. This military aid
program works on a cash basis to reimburse coalition partners for
outlays related to their counterterrorist operations as well as for
military support in Iraq and Afghanistan, including ammunition as well
as fuel, security and airlift. Pakistan, Poland, Jordan, Afghanistan,
Uzbekistan, Georgia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, and Djibouti are among the
countries that have benefited from this program. It is doubtful that
weapons air-lifted by the US military and CIA to various anti-Taliban
troops in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 were subject to the most
robust provisions of the small arms transfer policy, and reports suggest
that President Bush may have authorized a covert action to bypass
requirements associated with more public forms of military assistance.77
In the intervening years, though, several programs openly authorizing
transfer of defense articles to Iraqi and Afghan security forces also
appear to bypass the most stringent requirements of formal policy,78
especially where non-US weapons may be in In fact, over the past several
decades numerous transfers have involved supply of defense articles that
cannot be identified as American weapons. During the Cold War years,
there were several reasons not to want such weapons traced back to the
US. In the early 1960's, for example, the US wanted to hide its
involvement in the Angolan nationalist struggle from Portuguese colonial
rulers (and NATO ally) and so disguised the provenance of financial
support and arms supplied to Holden Roberto.79 Stockpiles of weapons
acquired during the Vietnam war facilitated clandestine and disguised
transfers, but the US also procured AK-47's from Egypt for use in
Afghanistan and Iran-Contra conspirators went to some lengths to procure
Chinese MANPADS for supply to Nicaragua.80 Since 2003 the US has
supplied more than 200,000 Soviet-style light weapons to Iraq through a
grant program,81 but that choice is presumably motivated by various
practicalities, including the desire to provide weapons that are
familiar or can be acquired cheaply. In this analysis I have treated
shadow transfers as a residual category. In some way or another, all
[shadow transactions fall outside the bounds of requirements codified in
the arms export or foreign assistance laws]{.underline}. In some cases
these transfers are made public, but they are excused from the most
rigorous requirement of law, including "cradle to grave" surveillance.
Most shadow transfers additionally share a marked lack of transparency
\--which, of course, makes the US rating on the SAS Transparency
Barometer especially ironic. Details about particular supply operations
are held tightly, even if the transfer itself complies with American
law. [Information is not always shared with the public (indeed, emergent
information may be denied), and in some cases pertinent details may be
withheld from most members of Congress as well. Presidential directives
are usually classified documents]{.underline}, and Intelligence
Committees in the Senate and the House are not at liberty to discuss
information shared with them in camera.

### Aff Answers

#### EDA is severely restricted and can't replace FMS it is capped and \$350 million a year

**Security Assistance Monitor 19**

https://securityassistance.org/content/excess%20defense%20articles

Under section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195),
the U.S. government has the authority to transfer defense articles in
excess of U.S. Approved Force Acquisition Objective and Approved Force
Retention Stock to foreign countries. Most transfers are given away at
no cost, but they may also be sold, loaned or leased to recipient
countries. This portion of the Security Assistance Monitor database only
includes such defense articles given to foreign countries. All Excess
Defense Article (EDA) transactions are coordinated by Security
Assistance Organizations (SAOs) at U.S. embassies, individual armed
services and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The armed service
overseeing a transfer determines the current value of EDA. [The
President is authorized to transfer EDA on a grant basis to countries
that the State Department defines as eligible, though **a foreign
government may not acquire more than \$350 million of EDA during any
given fiscal yea**r]{.underline}. [Restrictions on EDA transfers mandate
that items must be drawn from existing Defense Department (DOD) stocks;
that DOD cannot buy the items for the sole purpose of transferring them;
and that the transfer must not harm the U.S. armed forces\' level of
readiness]{.underline}, among others. Priority delivery of EDA is given
to NATO member countries and major non-NATO allies. If the original
value of a proposed EDA transfer exceeds \$7 million, [section 516
requires that the President provide 30 days\' advance notice to
Congress.]{.underline} Annual reporting must detail amounts of EDA
transferred to each country in the past FY, separating sales and grants.

Excess Defense Articles: Everything Must Go! The Pentagon has been
running a giant garage sale throughout the 1990s to unload its large
overstock of dated, but still lethal, weapons and spare parts. Not
wanting to pay the costs of storing or destroying the surplus, the
Department of Defense dispenses most of it for free or at deep reduction
through the excess defense articles (EDA) program. The Foreign
Assistance Act defines EDA as surplus equipment owned by the US
government, but not originally procured for anticipated sale or
assistance programs. [Militaries interested in obtaining free EDA must
go through a process similar to that for purchasing new weapons under
the FMS program]{.underline}. Through the US embassy\'s security
assistance office, the foreign government or organization submits a
letter of request to the Pentagon. The application is referred to the
Army, Navy, Air Force or Defense Logistics Agency, depending on the type
of equipment desired, and the services\' sales offices determine if EDA
will satisfy the request. By law, the Department of Defense must avoid
undercutting U.S. arms companies seeking to sell newly- manufactured
equipment. If transfers of surplus weapons are deemed appropriate, [the
DSAA must give Congress 30 days to consider the export of major items
before going forward.]{.underline} Gifts or sales of surplus ships are
treated differently; for naval vessels less than 20 years old, Congress
must pass a law (usually drafted by the Navy) approving the export sale
or grant. These laws usually pass without controversy. Since 1990, the
Pentagon has offered approximately \$8 billion of excess military
equipment to foreign militaries, including nearly 4,000 heavy tanks,
over 500 bombers and more than 300,000 pistols, rifles and machine guns.
Free shipments of surplus arms are regularly omitted from official
statistics on the overall value of U.S. arms exports. Even when surplus
arms are included, the value ascribed to them is often heavily
discounted, thereby further undercounting total levels of US arms
transfers. One government investigation found that EDA sold through the
FMS program are routinely priced at 5-50 percent of their original
acquisition cost. In 1996 the executive branch authorized over \$525.8
million of grant EDA transfers[. Due to a law passed by
Congress]{.underline} during the same year, beginning in 1997 [the
government will be limited to giving away no more than \$350 million of
surplus arms annually]{.underline}. This cap is counted in terms of the
current value ascribed to the equipment, which-as stated-is often
unrealistically low.

#### EDA Transfers can't get spare parts---Additional support is only done as FMS

[Foreign countries must agree to certain restrictions prior to physical
transfer of defense articles]{.underline}. In accordance with the FAA
and AECA, purchasers must agree to use defense articles only for their
furnished purpose.122 The DSCA includes this restriction in all LOAs. In
addition to the LOA, all grant EDA recipients must sign a blanket
end-use, security, and retransfer assurances document.123 Once the EDA
is transferred, [the U.S. Government will scrutinize the recipient's use
of the defense articles through an end-use monitoring
program]{.underline}.124 Additionally, [unlike FMS
purchases]{.underline}, where new defense articles are sold under a
total package approach,125 [EDA are]{.underline} transferred at reduced
or no cost to the recipient and are [offered to the foreign country on
an "as is, where is" basis.]{.underline}126 [Once foreign countries
accept EDA, the United States is no longer responsible for any
maintenance, training, or service associated with the defense
article]{.underline}.127 [If a recipient wants]{.underline} to purchase
training or other [sustainment packages associated with a defense
article, they must submit a separate LOR, which is processed as an FMS
case]{.underline}.128 Furthermore, [Congress prohibited the use of DoD
funds for the logistics---crating, packing, handling and
transportation---of all EDA transfers]{.underline}.129 The President,
however, may grant an exception in accordance with section 516(e)(2).130
Additionally, recipients can pay the United States to arrange the
logistics of a transfer.131 As a result, expenses incurred transporting
defense articles can be a limiting factor affecting a country's
ability---and decision--- to purchase a defense article. In Iraq, the
logistics burden is less of a concern because most eligible defense
articles are already physically located in Iraq and the majority of EDA
transfers are in-place transfers.132

the U.S. Government can sell EDA]{.underline} from existing stocks
pursuant to section 21, AECA, **[using FMS procedures]{.underline}**.
[Second, foreign countries, approved by Congress, can receive grant EDA

### Includes Defense

#### Arms can be offensive or defensive---The Supreme Court has defined it as including defensive armor

Sometimes [dictionary definitions inform landmark
decisions]{.underline}. In *[Washington, DC, v.
Heller](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf) *(2008),
the case in which the high Court decided the meaning of the Second
Amendment right to keep and bear arms, both Justice Scalia and Justice
Stevens checked the dictionary definition of *arms*. Along with the
dictionaries of Samuel Johnson and Noah Webster, Justice [Scalia
cited]{.underline} Timothy [Cunningham's New and Complete Law
Dictionary]{.underline}* *(1771), [where arms is defined as "any thing
that a man wears for his defence,]{.underline} or takes into his hands,
[or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another]{.underline}"
(variations on this definition occur in English legal texts going back
to the 16th century). And [Justice Stevens cited]{.underline} both
Samuel [Johnson's definition of arms as "weapons of offence, or armour
of defence]{.underline}" (1755) and John Trusler's "by arms, we
understand those instruments of offence generally made use of in war;
such as firearms, swords, &c." (1794).

The term "Arms" did not and does not today mean "guns". [The term:
"arms" is a reference to military weaponry that may
include]{.underline}, but is not limited to guns. Note that one does not
buy a hunting rifle from an "arms dealer", one buys a hunting rifle at a
gun shop. Arms dealers sell [everything from land mines to attack
aircraft,]{.underline} gun dealers do not. Then and now [the term:
"arms" was a reference to a military arsenal.]{.underline} As we'll see
later, the problem with interpreting this as an individual right is that
eventually you have to explain why this right would be limited to guns?
Military weaponry or "arms" at the time were not limited to guns.
Military arsenals during war of 1812 were comprised of cannons, rockets,
warships, swords, etc. If the Amendment means to guarantee the
individual right to have military weapons why doesn't it guarantee you
right to have a rocket launcher or a box of hand grenades?

military aid. A further complexity in terminology is the Department of

not actually delivered (see p. 327). [The Arms Control Agency uses the
term "arms" to include weapons and **ammunition,** support equipment and

military exports were weapons and ammunition, 18 per cent supporting
equipment, 17 per cent spare parts and 24 per cent training, services
and construction. The agency said world military expenditures rose to
\$315-billion in 1974, up from \$280-billion in 1973 and \$160-billion
in 1965, in terms of current dollars. The estimated spending on military
materials worldwide in 1974 represented about 6 per cent of the value of
all goods and services produced that year.

### Mass Noun

#### "Arms" is a mass noun

**Harward 17** Barnaby Harward is an an editor and language trainer at
an international law firm in Warsaw, Poland, Common Mistakes in Business
English,
<https://blog.harwardcommunications.com/2017/04/12/the-difference-between-countable-and-uncountable-nouns-unit-and-mass-nouns/>

Mass nouns only have one form: e.g. furniture, clothes. So you can't say
1 furniture, 2 furnitures, 3 furnitures etc. This is why mass nouns are
also called uncountable nouns. **[Mass nouns cannot be used with
a/an]{.underline}**. WRONG: a furniture Mass nouns are fixed as singular
or plural. RIGHT: furniture, clothes WRONG: furnitures, a clothe
However, it may be possible to use "a piece of / an item of" for
singular and "some" for plural. RIGHT: a piece of furniture, some
furniture / an item of clothing, some clothes You can use e.g. the
furniture for both singular and plural references. **[Unit nouns usually
refer to one or many separate items or units]{.underline}**. E.g. a
chair/chairs, an office/offices, a client/clients, etc. **[Mass nouns
usually refer to: ideas, concepts]{.underline}** (e.g. approval,
employment) substances (e.g. meat, metal) liquids (e.g. water, beer)
powders (e.g. dust, sugar) Some words may be either a unit noun or a
mass noun, e.g. chicken Unit: My parents keep chickens. (birds) Mass: I
don't usually eat chicken. (meat) Compare: "I found a piece of chicken
in my soup." (mass = a piece of meat) "I found a piece of a chicken in
my soup." (unit = a piece of a bird) There are 4 **[types of mass
nouns:]{.underline}** Singular nouns that are always mass nouns
**[Plural nouns that are always mass nouns]{.underline}** Nouns that can
be unit nouns or mass nouns and have the same meaning Nouns that can be
unit nouns or mass nouns but have different meanings 1. Singular nouns
that are always mass nouns These nouns have no plural form. Examples:
furniture equipment advice information In many languages information is
a unit noun, and has both singular and plural forms. This is NOT the
case in English. As a result mistakes with information are very common.
WRONG: The informations that you sent us in your last email are out of
date. RIGHT: The information that you sent us in your last email is out
of date. 2. **[Plural nouns that are always mass nouns]{.underline}**
These nouns **[have no singular form.]{.underline}** They take the
plural verb form ("are", not "is") except for "news" which takes "is".
**[Examples:]{.underline}** clothes trousers scissors thanks news
customs **[arms (i.e. weapons)]{.underline}** remains.

#### When "arms" refers to weapons it is a plural non count noun---When it refers to limbs it is a count noun

**Berry 15** Roger Berry is the former Head of English at Lingnan
University in Hong Kong and has authored four books on English gammar,
including English Grammar: A Resource Book for Students, From Words To
Grammar, https://www.slideshare.net/orasov/from-words-to-grammar

20\. Chapter 1 Nouns 1.0 Introduction Nouns are the most numerous word
class in English, but individually they tend not to be as frequent as
the grammatical (or 'function') word classes, such as prepositions and
determiners. The most common nouns, time and people, are the 76th and
80th most frequent words in English, according to one frequency list
(and that is without discounting their occasional use as verbs).
**[Nouns have a number of interesting features]{.underline}** which are
not dealt with here: the distinction between singular and plural
(sometimes formed irregularly), the (Saxon) genitive and their formation
with certain derivational endings (such as -tion or -ment). A number of
important factors are focussed on in the activities below. By far **[the
most important is whether the noun is 'count' or
'noncount']{.underline}**. Thus, **[certain nouns can be 'counted'
grammatically in the sense that they can be preceded by
a/an]{.underline}** or one, two or any other numeral. A typical count
noun would be car: a car, two cars. **[Noncount nouns cannot be
'counted']{.underline}**. For example, advice: you cannot say \*an
advice or \*two advices (though you can use a counting expression: two
pieces of advice; here piece is the count noun). Many nouns can be both
count and noncount, often with little change in meaning (other than
referring to a mass of something or an individual item), e.g. string/a
string, divorce/a divorce. In other cases we regard one form as the
basic and the other as derived from it by a process of 'conversion',
with a predictable difference in meaning. Thus, a dog (count) can become
dog (noncount) to refer to the meat. This process is systematic since it
applies to other animals and their meat. However, in many cases the
difference between the count and noncount meanings, though there is a
relationship, is neither predictable nor systematic. A good example is
room. As a count noun it refers to a unit of a building; as a noncount
noun it means 'space'. They could almost be treated as different lexical
items. **[The choice of determiners is]{.underline}** also **[influenced
by the count status of a noun]{.underline}**. Thus, much is restricted
to noncount nouns and many to count (plural) nouns. Little and few are
similarly constrained. The, unlike a/an, can be used with both types of
noun, however, as can this and that. Some is usually used with noncount
nouns to refer to a vague quantity (some money) and count nouns in the
plural to refer to a vague number (some people), but it can also be used
with count singular nouns to indicate something or someone unknown: Some
student was looking for you. Another feature of nouns is that some only
occur in the plural form. Trousers and binoculars are good examples; we
cannot say \*a trouser/binocular. These are sometimes called
www.ebook3000.com 21. 8 Nouns plural nouns. However, in many such cases,
there is a singular form but with a very different meaning, which may in
turn have its own plural. **[Thus arms can either be a distinct plural
noun meaning 'weapons', or the plural of arm, meaning 'limbs'. This
factor may combine with the count status of a noun.]{.underline}** Thus,
glass can either be a noncount noun referring to the substance, or a
count noun referring to the item we drink from. (The relationship is not
predictable because a glass does not refer to anything made of glass,
such as a window; indeed, a 'glass' may be made of plastic.) However,
glasses can either be the plural of a glass or a distinct plural noun
meaning 'spectacles'. A third factor focussed on below is the sub-class
of 'collective nouns'. Certain singular count nouns can take a plural
verb form (if they are the subject) when they are regarded as referring
to a group of individuals. For example: The government have decided...
The alternative with a singular verb form is possible, if the
speaker/writer wishes to convey the idea a single body: The government
has decided... With such nouns a plural form is possible of course: The
governments have agreed... A final feature of nouns, very different from
the different sub-classes identified above, is their function in noun
phrases. Nouns are typically thought of as the head of noun phrases; for
example, a profitable business. But very often they function as a
premodifier, in front of a head noun: a business student. In this case
the distinction between count and noncount will not be formally marked
by an accompanying determiner, for example; however, the meaning is
usually the noncount one. This will be relevant in some of the exercises
below. The noun sselected below are not necessarily the most frequent,
but they are representative of the important factors outlined above.
1.1wood As explained above in 1.0, many nouns can be both count and
noncount with a difference in meaning. Sometimes this difference is
predictable, but sometimes it is not; in these cases the count and
noncount versions of such words seem to refer to separate lexical ideas.
This is certainly the case with wood. As a count noun it refers to a
collection of trees, smaller than a forest; for example: We camped in a
small wood at the side of the road. As a noncount noun it means the
material obtained from trees used for building, for making fires, etc.:
Different types of wood burn differently. Activity 1.1 Look at these
lines and decide whether wood is a: a. count noun b. noncount noun. 22.
Nouns  9   Hints: • Look at the determiner used with wood. If there is
no determiner, it is noncount (assuming of course that it is the head of
the noun phrase); if there is a, then it is count. • Work out the
meaning; if wood refers to the material then it is noncount, if it is a
place consisting of trees then count. 1. ...it's finished in an
attractive shade that enhances the natural grain of the wood. 2. \[It\]
consisted of rough grazing, perhaps within a wood. 3. So, I used the
ship's sails, rope, and pieces of wood, and after a lot of hard work I
had a very fine tent. 4. ...he's imagining the fox walking through the
wood and coming towards his window. 5. Our house is made of wood and is
dark green. 6. Only wych elm grew in the wood and it burned for me quite
well when dry. 7. And is it not the best wood for coffins? 8. Many
town-dwellers burn wood for pleasure. 9. Once one gets the taste for
smoking wood it is possible to mix and obtain subtle flavours... 10.
Regular visitors include two wood pigeons, seven collar doves,
innumerable rooks and jackdaws. 1.2 promise Promise is another of the
nouns discussed in 1.0 that are both count and noncount, but where the
two meanings are quite different. As a count noun it means something
that you say as a guarantee of future action: He's broken his promise
again. whereas as a noncount noun it means 'potential': She has lots of
promise. The adjective promising is related to this meaning, whereas the
verb promise usually refers to the count meaning. Activity 1.2 Look at
the lines below and decide whether promise is a: a. count noun b.
noncount noun. (Note: over half the occurrences of promise are the verb;
these are not included.) Hint: try to pluralise promise (making other
necessary changes). If this is possible without changing the meaning
then it is a count noun. 23. 10 Nouns 1. ...progress on the trunk road
is now a firm promise... 2. She is already a lacemaker of great
promise... 3. This new venture seems to hold great promise for the
future... 4. And, in the end, if much of the promise is still
unfulfilled, in his own words, 'I ain't done too bad'. 5. She recalled a
promise made by Mr Major when he became Prime Minister... 6. ...an
environment unnaturally charged with emotion and hooked on an expensive
promise of love and everlasting life. 7. The Society also gained some
interesting new facts regarding the BCR, together with the promise of
some more photographic material. 8. Notwithstanding this promise, the
use of road pricing to change travel habits still seems some way off. 9.
But Mr Clarke's statements since the meeting give the impression that he
reneged on his promise to us. 10. ...\[they\] died young, their promise
unfulfilled, like everyone from Jimmy Blanton to Charlie Parker. 1.3
business Business is another noun that changes meaning according to
whether it is count or noncount, without a predictable relationship
between the two meanings. As a count noun it indicates a company or a
particular activity; as a noncount noun, it refers to trade and
commercial activity, or activity in general. He's been running his own
business since he was 17. (count) This outbreak is a terrible business.
(count) I've got no head for business. (noncount) It is commonly used as
a premodifier in a noun phrase: We offer a comprehensive range of
services for the business traveller. Activity 1.3 Work out on these
lines whether business is a: a. count noun b. noncount noun. (There is
also one line where it is a premodifier.) Hint: try to pluralise
business (making other necessary changes). If this is possible without
changing the meaning then it is a count noun. 1. Scotch Whisky is a core
business for all of them. 2. Winning The Queen's Awards brings prestige,
credibility and increased business. 3. \[It\] has been an international
business for over 230 years. 4. The safest way to ensure that you are
getting the best practical business advice for your money is... 5. And
multi-player games are good for business. 24. Nouns  11   6. ...all the
important legal developments likely to affect your business... 7.
...\[he\] reckons that business is now becoming so complex that he needs
a new core of trained administrators. 8. His romantic northern-sounding
address...helped his business more than a little. 9. ...MPs are now
thrashing through the business of submitting themselves to their local
parties. 10. This is forcing people to equip themselves with computers
in a hurry. This is not an easy business. 1.4 work Work is another noun
which can be both count and noncount, with largely unrelated meanings.
As a noncount noun it refers to formal activity or employment: I've got
work to do. What time do you finish work today? (In this meaning one
equivalent count noun is job.) It can also be the place where people are
employed: She's not at work today. When it is count it generally refers
to a work of art. It is also common as a verb. Activity 1.4 Work out on
these lines whether work is a: a. count noun b. noncount noun. (There is
also one line where it is a premodifier.) Hint: sometimes a verb can
indicate the count status of a following noun. You do or carry out work,
but you create a work. 1. It also fits in with work being carried out at
other research centres. 2. ...a biblical text was used to create another
well-known work by the son... 3. Since we offer training as part of our
technical support contract, this work can easily be done by any office
worker. 4. All participants are work colleagues. 5. Without their
efforts this vital work could not be done. 6. In this second edition the
standard work has been fully revised with a number of new photographs.
7. In return she will do research or voluntary work. 8. If the outdoor
work is not for you, there are many ways in which you can still help. 9.
\[The artists\] are also displaying some of their work. 10. The Trust's
annual cycle rides have always proved popular and successful in raising
funds for our work. 25. 12 Nouns 1.5 play As a count noun play usually
refers to the works of a playwright: the plays of Shakespeare (and for
which the closest noncount equivalent is drama). As a noncount noun it
refers to sporting or entertaining activity (Play is good for children),
where it is closely related in meaning to the verb play. Activity 1.5
Work out whether play on these lines is: a. count b. noncount. Hint:
work out the meaning. 1. I am reminded of a line in Tony Kushner's play
Angels in America... 2. But this emphasis is rather distorting for the
play as a whole... 3. The six championship courts (five glass-backed)
provide ideal conditions for play... 4. Henry V offers, better than any
other play in the repertoire, what might be called a yuppie dynamic...
5. Science lends itself to learning through play. 6. Each play is
treated separately in its own section and no comparison among them is
made. 7. ...we are simply presented with certain aspects of the play's
style and development. 8. Cancellations notified to Reception before the
day of play will not be charged. 1.6 space As a count noun space refers
to a specific empty area: I couldn't find a parking space. In this it is
related in meaning to the noncount use, referring to a non-specific
area: It's a waste of space. However, there is another unrelated
noncount meaning where it refers to the universe outside the planet
Earth: Space: the final frontier... Activity 1.6 Decide whether space on
the following lines is a: a. count noun b. noncount noun referring to
the universe c. noncount noun referring to an indefinite empty area. 26.
Nouns  13   Hint: try to pluralise space without changing the meaning
(making other necessary changes). 1. Blooms of certain species of
coccolithophores are so vast that they can be seen from space... 2. When
the sun's rays hit the Earth a lot of the heat is reflected back into
space... 3. Unfortunately, limits of space dictate that I cannot discuss
all of the essays in the book... 4. ...these videos are indispensable to
anyone interested in space exploration. 5. There is no space here to
examine this issue in detail... 6. The need for more space led to the
move to the present offices... 7. Turn back to the beginning, and print
the child's name in the space on the title page... 8. Please make sure
that you write down your registration number in the space provided on
the sponsor form. 9. Home-made compost is wonderful, but you will need a
lot of space to make the necessary amount. 10. In fact, we know that if
we get into a confined space with the intention of defying gravity we
are running a risk... 1.7 room Room as a noncount noun is similar in
meaning to 'space', whereas as a count noun it refers to a unit of a
building. These two uses can be demonstrated in one example: There's no
room in that room. The first instance is noncount, the second count.
Activity 1.7 In these lines identify one line where room is noncount and
another where it appears to be noncount but in fact is count. Hint: try
to pluralise room. 1. Deep down in a blue half light of the control
room, sailors huddle over their radar screens... 2. That man's recorded
everything that was said in this room. 3. ...I haven't put that on,
because I haven't got room. 4. Strangely, though, the symptoms returned
to me every night when I retired to my bunk which occupied a corner of
the same room. 5. If there was the slightest breeze from any direction
the smoke would spread itself evenly between chimney and room in more or
less equal proportions... 6. It is in the blending room that the mature
Scotch Whiskies are combined with each other... 7. How can Anna get Carl
from the window of the room to the fire escape? 8. ...theirs was the
room with the broken bolt hanging from the door... 27. 14 Nouns 1.8 arms
**[The form 'arms' can either be a plural noun]{.underline}** (see 1.0)
**[meaning 'weapons']{.underline}**, **[for example: The treaty
specifies a reduction in conventional arms]{.underline}**, **[or the
plural of a count noun referring to the part of the body:]{.underline}**
She put her arms around me. It is not possible to say an arm meaning 'a
weapon'; this could only refer to the body part. **[In the plural
meaning, arms is often a premodifier]{.underline}**: the arms race.
Activity 1.8 Identify the lines below where arms is a plural noun. **[In
which is it a premodifier? Hint: try replacing arms with
weapons]{.underline}**. 1. But they also throw up their arms, and say
there is nothing they can do except hope that people power will
prevail... 2. Then press upwards until the arms are locked straight
out... 3. The help will come in the form of technology originally
developed in the USA for the arms industry... 4. They lay in each
other's arms... 5. ...the arms trade brings income at a time of serious
recession... 6. If you aren't using flags, cross your arms in front of
your body... 7. I held out my hands to my father as he came into the
room, and he took me in his arms. 8. If you wanted to make a person at a
distance come over to you you'd probably wave your arms. 9. They're like
the arms of the same monster. 10. \[It\] has been variously described in
the technical press as designed to monitor Soviet compliance with arms
treaties... 1.9 customs Customs, like arms, can either be a plural noun
referring to the organisation that controls the passage of goods into a
country (when it is often capitalised), or the plural of a count noun,
meaning 'habits' or 'traditions'. As the former it is often a
premodifier. Activity 1.9 Identify in the lines below where customs is a
count noun in the plural. Say also whether it is a premodifier. Hint:
look at the words that follow customs. 1. Thereafter he spoke on two
occasions (1723 and 1725) on customs matters... 2. The future of the
industry also depends on ease of access to the ports and a smooth
progression through customs and immigration procedures.

In answering this question, the Hampton court turned to various

of the statute.6 \" Interpretation of a statute involves ascertaining
the legislative intent behind the enactment of the statute.

\"claim\" in reaching its construction of the statute. The court
referred to the dictionary definition of \"reduce\" [as meaning \"to
diminish in size, amount, extent or number]{.underline};
[to]{.underline} make small or to lower, [bring down]{.underline} or to
change the denomination of [a quantity]{.underline}.\" 68 The court then
judicially defined \"claim\" as \"the amount of damages as determined by

#### Reduce means make smaller

**Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery 2007** Petersons Publishing
Company Arco

The word reduce means to diminish in size, amount, extent, or number. To
reduce the chances of war means to lessen the likelihood that there will
be war. The word reduce will sound familiar to you because of its
frequent use in math; for example, reducing both sides of an equation.
Related words are reduction and redundant.

#### Requires a numerical decrease, modify is not reduce

**State v. Knutsen,** 71 P. 3d 1065 - Idaho: Court of Appeals **2003**

By its plain language, Rule 35 grants a district court the authority
within a limited period of time to reduce or modify a defendant\'s
sentence after relinquishing jurisdiction. To [\"**reduce\" means to
diminish in size, amount, extent or number, or to make smaller, lessen
or shrink**]{.underline}. WEBSTER\'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY
1905 (1993[). To \"modify\" means to make more temperate and less
extreme, or to lessen the severity of something]{.underline}. Id. at
1452. Thus, under the plain meaning of its language, Rule 35 authorizes
a district court to diminish, lessen the severity of, or make more
temperate a defendant\'s sentence. An order placing a defendant on
probation lessens the severity of a defendant\'s sentence and thus falls
within the district court\'s authority granted by Rule 35. Other state
jurisdictions have held likewise in interpreting similar rules for
reduction of sentence. See State v. Knapp, 739 P.2d 1229, 1231-32
(Wy.1987) (similar rule of criminal procedure authorizes reduction of a
sentence of incarceration to probation); People v. Santana, 961 P.2d
498, 499 (Co.Ct.App.1997) (grant of probation is a \"reduction\" under
Colorado Cr. R. 35(b)).

### Permanent

#### Reductions must be permanent

MATTER OF **MONTESANI v. Levitt**, 9 AD 2d 51 - NY: Supreme Court,
Appellate Div., 3rd Dept. **1959**

Section 83\'s counterpart with regard to nondisability pensioners,
section 84, prescribes a reduction only if the pensioner should again
take a public job. The disability pensioner is penalized if he takes any
type of employment. The reason for the difference, of course, is that in
one case the only reason pension benefits are available is because the
pensioner is considered incapable of gainful employment, while in the
other he has fully completed his \"tour\" and is considered as having
earned his reward with almost no strings attached. It would be
manifestly unfair to the ordinary retiree to accord the disability
retiree the benefits of the System to which they both belong when the
latter is otherwise capable of earning a living and had not fulfilled
his service obligation. If it were to be held that withholdings under
section 83 were payable whenever the pensioner died or stopped his other
employment the whole purpose of the provision would be defeated, i.e.,
the System might just as well have continued payments during the other
employment since it must later pay it anyway. The section says
\"reduced\", does not say that monthly payments shall be temporarily
suspended; it says that the pension itself shall be reduced. The plain
dictionary meaning of the word is to diminish, lower or degrade. The
word \"reduce\" seems adequately to indicate permanency. Aside from the
practical aspect indicating permanency other indicia point to the same
conclusion. From 1924 (L. 1924, ch. 619) to 1947 (L. 1947, ch. 841) a
provision appeared in the Civil Service Law which read substantially as
follows: \"If the pension of a beneficiary is reduced for any reason,
the amount of such reduction shall be transferred from the pension
reserve fund to the pension accumulation fund during that period that
such reduction is in effect.\" (See L. 1924, ch. 619, § 2 \[Civil
Service Law, § 58, subd. 4\]; L. 1947, ch. 841 \[Civil Service Law, §
66, subd. e\].) This provision reappears in the 1955 Retirement and
Social Security Law as subdivision f of section 24. This provision is
useful for interpretative purposes. Since it prescribes that moneys not
paid because of reduction should be transferred back to the accumulation
fund the conclusion is inescapable that such reductions were meant to be
permanent. If temporary suspensions were intended this bookkeeping
device would result in a false picture of the funds, i.e., the reserve
fund would be depleted when it would contain adequate funds to meet
eventual payments 57\*57 to present pensioners. Likewise, the
accumulation fund would be improperly inflated with respect to the
present pensioners. Section 64 of the Retirement and Social Security Law
(§ 85 under the 1947 act) provides that any disability pension must be
reduced by the amount payable pursuant to the Workmen\'s Compensation
Law if applicable. In Matter of Dalton v. City of Yonkers (262 App. Div.
321, 323 \[1941\]) this court interpreted \"reduce\" to mean \"offset\"
in holding that under then section 67 (relating to Workmen\'s
Compensation benefits as do its successors sections 85 and 64), pensions
were to be offset by compensation benefits. This is merely another
indication that \"reduce\" means a diminishing of the pension pursuant
to a given formula rather than a mere recoverable, temporary suspension
during the time other benefits or salaries are being received by the
pensioner. (Also, cf., Retirement and Social Security Law, § 101 \[§ 84
under the 1947 act\].)

### Excludes increase

#### Reduce cannot mean increase

**US Federal Court of Appeals, 1999** "CUNA MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE
COMPANY, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. UNITED STATES, Defendant-Appellee,"
Lexis

\"The amount determined\" under § 809, by which the policyholder
dividend deduction is to be \"reduced,\" is the \"excess\" specified in
§ 809(c)(1). Like the word \"excess,\" [the word \"reduced\" is a
common, unambiguous, non-technical term that is given its ordinary
meaning.]{.underline} See San Joaquin Fruit & Inv. Co., 297 U.S. at 499.
[\"Reduce\" means \"to diminish in size, amount, extent, or
number]{.underline}.\" Webster\'s Third International Dictionary 1905.
Under CUNA\'s interpretation of \"excess\" in § 809(c), however, the
result of the \"amount determination\" under § 809 would be not to
reduce the policyholder dividends deduction, but to increase it. This
would directly contradict the explicit instruction in § 808(c)(2) that
the deduction \"be reduced.\" [The word \"reduce\" cannot be
interpreted]{.underline}, as CUNA would treat it, [to mean
\"increase.\"]{.underline}

symptom is one (or more) that has or will have, if left untreated, a
negative impact on the quality of life (health) of the subject. This
also applies to the biological effects, such as reducing collagen
deposition in the lungs of a subject, reducing expression of a cytokine
in an alveolar macrophage of a subject, reducing expression of a TLR in
an alveolar macrophage of a subject, etc., the end result of which would
be to ameliorate the deleterious effects of inflammation and lung
remodeling.

### Includes Future

#### Stopping future sales is a reduction

In other words, the argument is that stoppage of increment with future
effect is not a punishment envisaged by Section 7. It is correct that
withholding of increments is not a punishment provided as such in
Section 7 of the Police Act. The argument of the learned Government
Advocate, however, is that the word \"reduce\" in Section 7 is
comprehensive enough to include the punishment of with-holding of
increments. The language employed in Section 7 is \"not reduction of
rank\" as employed in Article 311 of the Constitution but the only word
used is \'reduce\'. **[The grammatical meaning of the word
\'reduce\']{.underline}** inter alia **[is to lesson in any way as in
size, weight, amount, value]{.underline}**, price, **[etc., to diminish,
to lower as in rank or position]{.underline}**, to decrease. (See
Webster\'s New 20th Century Dictionary). **[When the increments of an
incumbent are stopped his future progress is brought to a
stand-still]{.underline}** for a particular length of time. **[It is the
stoppage of his increase which results in a sense in a
decrease]{.underline}** of his emoluments. In our opinion, therefore,
**[the word \"reduce\" is wide enough to include the]{.underline}**
punishment of **[stoppage of increments. Stoppage of increments with
future effect is a permanent reduction]{.underline}** in the speed of
progress so far as emoluments of an employee are concerned. Bhawani
Shanker, therefore, could be punished by stoppage of increment under
Section 7 of the Police Act. In this view of the matter, Bhawani
Shankar\'s writ petitions Nos. 645/64, 33/65 and 36/65 have no force and
are dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.

### Allows addressing causes

Graeme **Smith** MD. , Statistical Analyst Melbourne Graduate School of

"Holding Facilities"
http://www.ccac.net.au/files/Holding_facilities_UAM95Smith.pdf

Our mission is not just to care for Melbourne\'s lost, sick and
abandoned animals. It is to look after, and reduce the incidence of,
lost and abandoned animals (Fradkin, 1994). The key difference is
enshrined in the word reduce. It demands that we strike at the causes of
the these situations rather than just address the consequences. This
holistic approach is a water-shed development which must be understood
by any student of today\'s urban animal management scene. The above has
been the motivation and raison d\'etre for the still ongoing expansion
program at the Lost Dogs\' Home and Cat Shelter over the past ten years.

Volume 8 **1899** New York Court of Appeals

> The well-established general rule of law that an agent is bound to

> policy itself providing for a reduction of its amount, and, therefore,
> the only remedy for the insuring company, if dissatisfied with its
> contract, was to order its cancellation on paying a rebate of premium
> in the manner prescribed by the terms of the policy; and that the
> instructions given in the letter to the agents could not be carried
> out, and were inconsistent with the rights of the party insured; and
> that the evidence proposed would, in effect, vary the terms of the

> the question was only an offer to show that some duty devolved upon an

> customs of the fire insurance business, and thus was a trade term, and
> clearly indicated to the defendants, who were fire insurance agents of
> large experience, what steps should be taken to relieve plaintiffs
> from the excessive amount. The ruling of the court denied any such
> meaning to the word in the present case. That parol evidence is
> competent to prove the special or trade meaning of words has long been

(Clara, [European Union Sanctions and Foreign Policy: When and why Do
They Work?]{.underline}, p. 105, google books) **CFSP = Common Foreign
and Security Policy** for the EU

A number of member states Belgium, Germany and Italy supplemented these
EU actions with national measures, such as the suspension of grants,
loans and aid (Kreutz 2004). The EU measures, most of which are
diplomatic sanctions, ceased to be valid in October 1990 (Wacker 2004),
while the arms embargo remained in place. The fact that the arms embargo
was never for- malised in a CFSP instrument has significant
implications. Firstly, the measures were adopted on an indefinite basis,
unlike most CFSP regimes currently in force, which contain an expiry
date, or \'exit-clause\'. Secondly, no common list of goods covered by
the embargo was agreed, as is routine practice with current CFSP arms
embargoes; thus, individual member states remain responsible for
interpreting the embargo. Given that the embargo was interpreted as
excluding the supply of equipment under agreements that were already
con- cluded, European arms sales under those contracts continued. Some
items with military applications, such as early warning systems, were
also supplied. However, [a US study]{.underline} published in 1998
[estimated]{.underline} that [European arms sales to China were **not
substantial**, making up **only 2.7 per cent**]{.underline} of China\'s
imports [of military equipment]{.underline} (cited in Wacker 2004:2). In
2003, EU member states refused applications for 44 export licences for
military equipment to China, and granted 159. However, [the volume of
sales remains]{.underline} \"relatively [small\' according to experts\'
estimates]{.underline} (Austin 2005:9).

<http://www.statehumanities.org/library/advocacyhbweb.pdf>.

Prior to the 1976 law, the percentage of income or activities that an
organization could devote to lobbying was unclear. **[Based on decisions
of courts]{.underline}**, which were not necessarily consistent with one
another, an organization could spend no more than **["an insubstantial
amount"]{.underline}** of its budget on lobbying, with **[up to 5
percent being interpreted as "insubstantia]{.underline}**l**[."
Conversely, a substantial amount was "more than 5
percent]{.underline}**." Any organization engaging in a substantial
amount of lobbying (devoting more than 5 percent of its budget to
lobbying activity) could be in danger of losing its tax deductible
status under this admittedly vague guideline.

#### Percentages are a bad way to define substantially

the Law.**

In contrast, **[the court in Haswell v. United States]{.underline}**

The court **[found that applying a strict percentage test to determine
whether activities are substantial would be
inappropriate]{.underline}**, since  \[\*308\]  such a test \"obscures
the complexity of balancing the organization\'s activities in relation
to its objectives and circumstances in the context of the totality of
the organization.\"

#### Substantial means "of considerable amount" -- not a specific percentage

**Prost 4** (Judge -- United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, "Committee For Fairly Traded Venezuelan Cement v. United
States", 6-18,
http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/04opinions/04-1016.html)

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of
§ 1677(4)(C).  In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach. 
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that no "precise mathematical
formula" or "'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a dumping
concentration analysis.  SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also Venez.
Cement, 279 F. Supp. 2d at 1329-30.  Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis."  SAA at 860.  Finally, [the definition of the word
"substantial" undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC's [argument.  The word
"substantial" generally means "considerable in amount,]{.underline}
value or worth."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280
(1993).  [**It does not imply a specific number or cut-off**.  What may
be substantial in one situation may not be in another
situation.]{.underline}  The very breadth of the term "substantial"
undercuts the CFTVC's argument that Congress spoke clearly in
establishing a standard for the Commission's regional antidumping and
countervailing duty analyses.  It therefore supports the conclusion that
the Commission is owed deference in its interpretation of "substantial
proportion."  The Commission clearly embarked on its analysis having
been given considerable leeway to interpret a particularly broad term.

#### Substantial is qualitative not quantitative 

H. Beau **Baez 6**, Assistant Professor of Law, Liberty University
School of Law, Seattle University Law Review Spring, 2006 29 Seattle
Univ. L. R. 581

The Supreme Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause to prohibit state
actions that discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce
as part of its Negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. n83 A state\'s
attempt to tax out-of-state companies may be seen as such a burden if,
among other things, n84 the tax is applied to a company that does not
have \"substantial nexus\" with the taxing state. n85 Expressly
rejecting a facts-and-circumstances test, which would have weighed
various factors, the Quill Court instead created a simple bright-line
test measured by physical presence in a state. n86 The Quill Court held
that the physical presence of a company in the taxing state satisfies
the Commerce Clause substantial nexus test. n87 [Unfortunately, lower
courts have found some ambiguity]{.underline} in Quill, [and have
struggled to apply the bright-line to the facts of real
cases]{.underline}. n88¶ Admittedly, part of [the confusion lies in the
name given to the legal requirement by the Quill Court: \"substantial
nexus.\" The word \"substantial\" connotes weighing of
factors]{.underline}, yet the Court attached a bright-line test to the
legal phrase \"substantial nexus.\" Thus, we have a legal requirement
that requires a company to have substantial nexus with a state before it
can be subjected to a state\'s regulatory use tax authority, but
\[\*596\] that legal requirement is determined by a bright-line physical
presence test.¶ [This lack of clarity by the Court is not new. Before
Quill, the Court referred to the \"substantial nexus\" n89 requirement
alternatively as \"sufficient nexus,\" n90 \"sufficiently connected,\"
n91 \"requisite nexus,\" n92 \"necessary basis,\" n93 \"sufficient
relation,\" n94 \"necessary nexus,\" n95 \"adequate nexus,\" n96
\"obvious nexus,\" n97 \"clear and sufficient nexus]{.underline},\" n98
and Chief Justice Rehnquist\'s colorful phrase \"nexus aplenty.\" n99
However, even after Quill \-- the seminal nexus case of the last
twenty-five years \-- [the Court has continued describing the
\"substantial nexus\" requirement in different ways]{.underline}, such
as \"adequate nexus,\" n100 \"sufficient nexus,\" n101 \"Commerce Clause
nexus,\" n102 \"nexus aplenty\" n103 (this phrase is apparently just too
good for the Justices to let go), and, in one of its most recent state
tax cases, \"minimal connection.\" n104 These interchangeable phrases
suggest that the phrase \"substantial nexus\" in Quill is the Court\'s
shorthand for Commerce Clause nexus \-- any substantive meaning of the
phrase must be found in the case law and not in the phrase \"substantial
nexus\" itself. n105¶ The Quill Court likewise lacks clarity when it
describes the due process minimum contacts test: \"due process nexus
analysis requires that we ask whether an individual\'s connections with
a State are substantial enough to legitimate the State\'s exercise of
power over him.\" n106 It is curious that the Court describes the due
process minimum contacts test as requiring substantial contacts; n107 a
threshold that is easily met by most companies doing business across
state lines. Since the Court spent so \[\*597\] much time explaining
that there are two separate nexus tests, it would be odd for the Court
to then define them similarly.¶ [Examining the legal definition of
\"substantial\" provides some light as to what the Court meant by
\"substantial nexus\"]{.underline} in Quill. [Black\'s Law]{.underline}
Dictionary [defines \"substantial\" as \"belonging to substance;
actually existing; real; not seeming or imaginary; not illusive; solid;
true; veritable.\"]{.underline} n108 [This]{.underline} legal
[definition furnishes evidence that \"**substantial\" is defined
qualitatively, not quantitatively.** Webster\'s]{.underline} Dictionary
[also lends support to the qualitative nature of the word by defining
its primary meaning as \"consisting of or relating to
substance]{.underline}; not imaginary or illusory: real, true;
important, essential,\" n109 [while the notion of \"substantial\" as
quantitative is relegated to a secondary meaning]{.underline} of the
word. n110¶ Though the phrase \"substantial nexus\" is amorphous, Quill
does attempt to provide guidance for Commerce Clause nexus by providing
a test that examines qualitative contacts that do and do not create
nexus (i.e., the bright-line physical presence test). Specifically, the
Quill Court eliminates any room for quantitative nexus speculation
because its bright-line test \"firmly establishes the boundaries of
legitimate state authority.\" n111 A \"substantial nexus\" test that
looks primarily at the quantity of contacts ignores both the bright-line
test as well as the Court\'s explicit rejection of \"tests with more
contextual balancing inquiries.\" n112 The Court was aware that it could
have established a facts-and-circumstances test (i.e., a test where the
number of contacts is weighed); however, the Court refused to do so
after extensive discussion of the topic. n113 A brightline test is
\"artificial at its edges . . . \[however\] this artificiality . . . is
more than offset by the benefits of a clear rule.\" n114 If a business
has contacts that fall on one side of the state line they have nexus,
while if their contacts are on the other side of the state line there is
no nexus. This is a simple and clear rule that does not take into
account factors like the number of contacts or the type of contact
(e.g., solicitation, technical support, or training).¶ [Given the
history and context of the phrases used by the Court to describe
Commerce Clause nexus, it is useless to try to discern any substantive
meaning from the phrases \"substantial nexus,\"]{.underline}
\"sufficient nexus,\" or \"nexus aplenty\" themselves. Should state tax
jurisdiction debates be relegated to a tit-for-tat where those that want
to avoid nexus \[\*598\] use the phrase \"substantial nexus\" while
those wanting to create nexus rely on the phrases \"sufficient nexus\"
or \"minimal contacts?\" **[Only modern-day sophists n115 would
seriously contend that such debate would be useful.]{.underline}** n116
In the end it is case law that animates the concept of Commerce Clause
nexus; out-of-context discussions

It is interesting to note, however, that **[because only "U.S. origin
items]{.underline}** wherever located" **[are subject to the EAR, dual
use and commercial items and technology which are of non-U.S. origin
clearly are no longer subject to the EAR]{.underline}** after their
initial export from the United States. While **[the EAR]{.underline}**
does not specifically define "U.S. origin" it does **[define items which
are not U.S. origin as "items that are made outside the United
States]{.underline}**." 15 CFR § 732.2(d). B. A Foreign Person Develops
Foreign-Made Items which Contain U.S. Components 1. The AECA and the
ITAR As mentioned above, U.S. export controls "follow the part". In
fact, DDTC has taken the position (known as the "look through" doctrine)
that commercial or dual use items become subject to the ITAR in the
event they incorporate or are integrated with an ITAR controlled part or
component. See Consent Agreements of The Boeing Company and Goodrich
Corporation/L-3 Communications Corp. (2006). Therefore, it is not
surprising that DDTC takes the position that under the AECA and the
ITAR, a foreign-made article which incorporates items on the USML that
have been exported from the United States is considered subject to the
ITAR because the 9 U.S. maintains jurisdiction under the ITAR over the
items no matter where they are and regardless of whether they have been
incorporated into a foreign made article. This rationale is supported by
the AECA's provision for an end-use monitoring program to ensure that
items which incorporate ITAR controlled components or technology are not
diverted to unauthorized end-users. 22 USCA § 2785. It is further
supported by the ITAR requirement that exporters from the U.S.
incorporate a statement in the bill of lading and invoice accompanying
USML items which provides that the items may not be reexported "either
in their original form or after being incorporated into other end-items,
without prior written approval of the Department of State." 22 CFR §
123.9. Finally, because there is no provision in the ITAR, such as can
be found in the EAR, which creates an exception for foreign-made items
which contain a de minimis amount of U.S. components, it must be
presumed that the ITAR is applicable to foreign items that contain ITAR
components, regardless of the value the component contributes to the
item. 2. The EAA and the EAR Like the AECA and the ITAR, the EAA/EAR
controls will apply to a foreign-made commodity if it contains
commercial or dual use U.S. origin components. However, the EAA contains
an exception to this general rule. Specifically, [the EAA provides that
export controls may not be imposed solely on the basis that a good
contains parts or components subject to export controls]{.underline} if

Even if we were to focus on the isolated word \"from\" without any
context, as Pease does, that word does not support Pease\'s
interpretation of the term limit provision. Pease relies on a
Merriam-**[Webster\'s dictionary definition of \"from,\" which defines
\"from\" as a \"function word to indicate the source,]{.underline}**
cause, agent or basis . . . .\" (Webster\'s 11th New Collegiate Dict.
(2003) pp. 502-503.) However, this definition undermines Pease\'s
argument, given that District 6---not District 2---elected Councilmember
Zapf in 2010 and thus acted as the \"source, cause, agent, or basis\" of
her term in office. Pease also relies on an alternative definition from
Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary that defines \"**[from\" as \"a function
word to indicate the starting or focal point of an
activity]{.underline}** . . . .\" (Ibid.) Once again, this definition
supports Councilmember Zapf\'s position. The \"focal 15 point\" of her
first term of office was District 6, on behalf of which she acted while
serving as its council member. Pease provides **[a third dictionary
definition]{.underline}** as well, which **[defines \"from\" as \"a
starting point of a physical movement]{.underline}** or a starting point
in measuring or reckoning . . . .\" (Ibid.) To the extent this
definition applies at all, the \"starting point\" of Councilmember
Zapf\'s term of office was District 6, where she resided when her term
began in 2010. Thus, the definitions of the word \"from\" that Pease
offers do not support his argument. Quite the opposite, they undercut
it.

Arms Sales in 2018: The Trump Record - Rhetoric Versus Reality,
https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_44475f2b94464e77b57c6d33953dc939.pdf

One of the Trump administration's primary rationales for its efforts to
expand [U.S. arms sales]{.underline} is the assertion that weapons
exports create large numbers of jobs in the United States. This claim
does not hold up to scrutiny.13 For example, [the Trump administration
has sharply increased the number of deals in which foreign nations
**produce U.S.-developed weaponry in their countries**]{.underline}
under licensing and coproduction agreements. [These deals support
production overseas, as well as helping potential competitors build up
their own defense industries]{.underline}. The number and value of
licenses granted to manufacturing U.S. weapons and weapons components
overseas nearly doubled from 2017 to 2018. In 2017 there were 19
manufacturing licenses granted, valued at \$12.6 billion. In 2018 those
figures jumped to 40 licenses granted, valued at \$19.8 billion. The
dollar value of licensing and manufacturing deals in 2018 accounted for
over 25% of all U.S. arms offers in that year, an indication of the
growing number of arms offers that involve overseas production. A case
in point regarding the administration's exaggerated claims of arms
sales-related jobs is Saudi Arabia, where President Trump has claimed
that there are hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs tied to arms sales to
that nation. He has used this argument in opposing a reduction in U.S.
sales to the Saudi regime in response to its murder of U.S.-resident
journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi
Arabia's killing of civilians in its intervention in Yemen. There are
serious questions as to whether arms sales-related jobs should be an
adequate reason to arm repressive regimes. But putting that aside for
the moment, President Trump's assertions on arms exports and jobs don't
stand up to even minimal scrutiny. Based on actual deliveries of arms,
which is the best measure of how much money is actually flowing in any
given year pursuant to current and past weapons offers, U.S. jobs tied
to Saudi arms deals likely numbered in the range of 20,000 to 40,000
jobs in 2018, less than ten percent of President Trump's claims of
500,000 jobs directly tied to U.S. arms sales to the regime in Riyadh. A
claim of one million jobs appeared to involve both arms sales and other
commercial offers, so is not included in the above calculations.14 U.S.
arms sales more broadly also create far fewer U.S. jobs than is commonly
assumed. Deliveries under the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program
totaled \$27.4 billion, which by standard estimating procedures would
account for 190,000 jobs in the United States, in an economy that
employs over 155 million people. That would put the share of arms
exports in total U.S. employment at well under two-tenths of one per
cent of total U.S. employment.15 But this figure is likely an
overstatement, because [many of the jobs associated with U.S. arms sales
are based overseas due to coproduction and offset
agreements]{.underline}, and many others may not be the equivalent of
full-time employment on products destined for foreign customers, as
workers switch between production for export and work on weapons
purchased by the Pentagon. [A coproduction agreement is an arrangement
in which part of a U.S. weapons system sold to a foreign customer is
produced in the recipient nation]{.underline}. Offsets are deals in
which U.S. arms supplying companies invest in the economy of the
recipient nation to "offset" their costs in buying a U.S. weapons
system. Offsets can involve coproduction, or investments in helping the
recipient nation develop their own arms industry or another sector of
their economy, or, in some cases, cash payments that are supposed to be
devoted to economic development but may or may not be used for that
purpose. The exact value of U.S. offsets and coproduction agreements in
any given year cannot be determined due to inadequate reporting
procedures, but it is clear that they drain substantial numbers of jobs
in the United States. A few examples should suffice to indicate the
substantial impact of these deals. In Saudi Arabia, for example, that
country's new economic goal is for 50% of the value of all of its arms
imports to be spent in Saudi Arabia by 2030.16 [Examples include a
Lockheed Martin deal to assemble helicopters supplied to Saudi Arabia by
its Sikorsky helicopter subsidiary in Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}17
[Other U.S. firms like Raytheon and Boeing have set up offices in the
Persian Gulf to help them broker similar arrangements in efforts to help
countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE build up their defense
industries]{.underline}. [In the UAE, Lockheed Martin is helping that
country develop factories to produce robotic machine tools]{.underline},
which can be used in the defense and aerospace sectors. It is also
helping train UAE personnel in cybersecurity and space technologies.18
[The largest and most lucrative deals involving overseas production of
U.S. weaponry involve work on the F-35]{.underline} combat aircraft. In
addition to component production in a number of partner nations, both
[Italy and Japan are building Final Assembly and Checkout]{.underline}
(FACO) [facilities for the aircraft]{.underline}, which will generate
significant numbers of jobs in those countries. This is rarely pointed
out when President Trump touts the jobs impact of U.S. arms sales. Last
but not least, [the Trump administration has sharply increased the
number of deals in which foreign nations produce U.S.-developed weaponry
in their countries]{.underline} under licensing and coproduction
agreements. [These deals support production overseas]{.underline}, as
well as help- ing potential competitors build up their own defense
industries. [The number]{.underline} and value [of licenses granted to
manufacturing U.S. weapons and weapons components overseas nearly
doubled from 2017 to 2018.]{.underline} In 2017 there were 19
manufacturing licenses granted, valued at \$12.6 billion. In 2018 those
figures jumped to 40 licenses granted, valued at \$19.8 billion. The
dollar value of licensing and manufacturing deals in 2018 accounted for
over 25% of all U.S. arms offers in that year, an indication of the
growing number of arms offers that involve overseas production.

claims that arms sales are a good job creator, [an increasing percentage

overseas.]{.underline} Often, when the U.S. exports arms, it is also
exporting jobs."

The globalization of arms production has been called the \"quiet
revolution\" in the arms market,30 and the phenomenon of emerging
transnational defense industries [is both underexplored and
underappreciated for its portents. For one thing, the emergence of a
more transnational defense industry means that arms production can no
longer be viewed in strictly national terms]{.underline}.
Internationalized armaments development and manufacture, coupled with
formalized and integrative interfirm linkages, blurs the concept of
\"indige- nous\" weapon systems. Just as important, [the global arms
trade cannot be defined simply as the export of finished weapon
systems]{.underline}. Instead, greater attention must be paid to the
international commerce in military technology, production know-how, and
joint manufacture and marketing. To do other- wise is to ignore a
growing and increasingly significant component of the global arms
market. The increasing globalization of arms production has economic,
political, and military implications for both industry and government.
With the end of the Cold War, and in an era of shrinking military
budgets and increasingly competitive defense markets, [transnational
arms development and produc- tion are regarded by a growing number of
governments and defense firms to be absolutely essential]{.underline} to
preserving national defense industrial and tech- nology bases.
Internationalizing their arms industries may be the only means left by
which some nations can cost-effectively maintain a \"critical minimum\"
of military R&D and production capacity necessary to meet national
defense needs. In addition, globalization is increasingly a potentially
important mech- anism for technology sharing and other types of
\"flowbacks.\" Governments and defense firms that refuse to globalize
their arms development and pro- duction activities could eventually find
critical overseas markets, technolo- gies, and resources closed to them.
U.S. participation in international collaborative arms programs, for
exam- ple, has basically had three goals. First, the United States has
promoted the transfer of U.S. weapons technology (through licensing and
other coprod- uction arrangements) in order to strengthen its friends
and allies around the world militarily; this was particularly evident in
Western Europe and Japan at the beginning of the Cold War (during the
1950s and 1960s), and in South Korea and Taiwan during the 1970s (in
part as a result of the Nixon Doctrine) Beginning in the 1970s, however,
the United States began to realize that critical benefits in the form of
rationalization, standardization, and interop- erability (RSI) could
also accrue from increased armaments cooperation with its allies,
especially those in NATO, resulting in improved alliance coordi- nation
and effectiveness, and reduced R&D and production costs. More recently,
the U.S. government has seen globalization as a means whereby it could
help preserve and strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base, by
gaining access to foreign markets and innovative foreign technologies.
At the same time, globalization raises several concerns about national
security requirements, the military and commercial effects of global
technol- ogy diffusion, and conventional arms proliferation.
Globalization may chal- lenge long-term Western security policies and
military posture in at least five major ways. First of all,
globalization should raise considerable apprehension about the
continuing spread of advanced conventional weaponry, military systems
technologies, and other know-how pertaining to defense production and
systems integration. [A general preoccupation with international arms
sales has caused many observers to overlook the emergence of an
increasingly internationalized defense industry]{.underline}. Even
today, [few arms control organiza- tions pay much attention to the
growing globalization of armaments production.]{.underline} Most
[statistics on overseas arms sales do not usually factor in technology
transfers or codevelopment programs, or track the transfer of weapons
pro- duction capabilities]{.underline} arising out of joint ventures
between defense firms. For example, [weapon systems produced under these
types of arrangements are not covered by the current reporting
requirements of the United Nations Register on Conventional Arms
Transfers]{.underline}. Yet such international arms col- laboration,
involving as it does the permanent share-out of resources, skills, and
technology that underlie [armaments production, is potentially **more
destabilizing than outright arms sales**. These capabilities, once
transferred, cannot be cut off or recovered.]{.underline}

#### Dictionaries are not authorities on what words mean

**Baron 11** Dennis Baron is a professor of English and linguistics at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Webster\'s lays down the

<https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/54098>, D.A. 6/1/19

Even though judicial dictionary look-ups are on the rise, the Court has
never commented on how or why dictionary definitions play a role in
Constitutional decisions. That's further complicated by the fact that
[dictionaries aren't designed to be legal authorities, or **even
authorities on language**]{.underline}, though many people, including
the justices of the Supreme Court, think of them that way. What
[dictionaries are,]{.underline} [instead]{.underline}, are [records of
how some speakers and writers have used words. Dictionaries]{.underline}
don't include all the words there are, and except for an occasional
usage note, they [don't tell us what to do with the words they do
record]{.underline}. Although we often say, "The dictionary says...,"
there are many dictionaries, and they don't always agree.

#### Meaning of words is fluid---Single dictionary definitions aren't authoritative---Empirically Supreme Court Judges pick and choose definitions that support their interpretation because language is flexible

**Baron 11** Dennis Baron is a professor of English and linguistics at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Webster\'s lays down the
law, JUN 15, 2011 8:45 PM BY <DEBARON@ILLINOIS.EDU>,
<https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/54098>, D.A. 6/1/19

Sometimes the justices can't find the support they're looking for in
dictionaries, and [when a judicial interpretation of a law clashes with
the lexical evidence, the justices are quick to reject the authority of
the same dictionaries that in other cases they hold up]{.underline} as
repositories of wisdom and reason. In Heller, none of the justices
thought that the Second Amendment protected a citizen's right to own a
tank or a surface-to-air missile, even though such weapons fit the
definition of arms. But they did argue over the meaning of the phrase
bear arms, specifically, whether the amendment protects the right to
bear arms only in connection with military service. The Court's
conservative majority decided that it did not, that it also guaranteed
the right to bear arms for hunting and self-defense. Dictionaries,
however, show that from the 18th century to the present, the phrase bear
arms typically appears in military contexts, not ones involving
individual self-defense, hunting, or sport. As the historian Garry Wills
put it, "One does not bear arms against a rabbit." But Justice [Scalia
rejected the dictionary evidence that did not support his
understanding]{.underline} of the Second Amendment[,
writing]{.underline} in his majority opinion, "[the fact that the
phrase]{.underline} \[bear arms\] [was commonly used in a particular
context does not show that it is limited to that context."]{.underline}
In other cases, [when one dictionary doesn't give the justices what they
want, they pick another]{.underline}, looking sometimes to the American
Heritage for proof, other times to Webster's Third, and still other
times to the Oxford English Dictionary, in order to make the meaning
come out right. To find out what a word might have meant to the Framers,
the justices even quote the dictionaries of Noah Webster (1828) or
Samuel Johnson (1755). And of course they use Black's Law Dictionary to
elucidate technical terms. This constant cherry-picking confirms that
[jurists]{.underline} do [recognize dictionaries as fluid and
context-bound, much like the words they define]{.underline}. The job of
the lexicographer is not to give the law, or even to interpret it.
[Dictionaries don't exist to create meaning]{.underline}. Instead, they
record the meanings assigned to words and phrases by speakers and
writers, by professionals and amateurs, by lawyers and judges, by
upright citizens and criminal defendants. [These meanings are multiple
and changeable, and reliance on dictionaries should always be
instructive, never absolute]{.underline}. Regardless of what the Framers
thought or what the Constitution says, the meaning of our laws, like the
meaning of the words they're made of, is always open to interpretation:
that's why we have courts, and many, many lawyers, and it\'s why there
are many dictionaries, not just one. Justice Scalia was right to go
beyond the dictionary in Heller because, to paraphrase the slogan of the
NRA and its gun aficionados, [dictionaries don't make meanings, people
do.]{.underline} But sometimes, it seems, the dictionary helps.
