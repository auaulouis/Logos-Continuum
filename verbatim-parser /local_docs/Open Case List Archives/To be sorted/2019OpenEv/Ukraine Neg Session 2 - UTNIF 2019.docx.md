### No Link -- Arm Sales

#### While Russia will backlash over arms sales, they will not start a war

**Bodner 17** (Matthew Bodner, 12-19-2017, \"US arming Ukraine? A look
at how Moscow might respond,\" Defense News,
https://www.defensenews.com/smr/european-balance-of-power/2017/08/02/us-arming-ukraine-a-look-at-how-moscow-might-respond/)

[The conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow is accused of backing
separatists in the Donbas region bordering Russia, has been frozen for
the better part of two years.]{.underline} Neither side has managed to
achieve decisive victories, and a 2015 cease-fire protocol known as
Minsk II has failed to achieve any lasting results. The conflict in
Donetsk and Luhansk festers on. [Russian defense analyst Vasily Kashin
told Defense News that U.S. weapons --- particularly Javelins --- will
do little to change the course of the conflict. The primary weapons
being used in Donbas]{.underline}, he said, [are not tanks and anti-tank
missiles, but old artillery systems.]{.underline} Ultimately, all the
proposal would accomplish is signaling to Moscow that Washington is
upping the ante in Ukraine, Kashin asserted. "There must be an
understanding that there will be costs," Kashin said, "and these will
not be limited to the Ukrainian theater. There are a wide range of
weapons systems we \[Russia\] can sell to Iran without violating U.N.
sanctions, for example. And any improvement in Ukrainian military
capabilities will be met with much greater development of \[separatist\]
capabilities." Andrei Frolov, an analyst at the Moscow-based Center for
the Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, agrees that [the Kremlin
will respond with heavier weapon deliveries to the Donbas rebel forces.
"In my mind, the Javelin is more a defensive weapon than anything else.
I don't think this would be very dangerous, but it would be]{.underline}
quite [provocative]{.underline}," Frolov said. Moscow will wait for
Washington to finalize its proposal --- assuming it even reaches Trump's
desk --- before exploring formal responses. The two sides have more
immediate controversies plaguing their relations at the moment. The
Kremlin is now awaiting Washington's response to strict limitations
imposed on U.S. Embassy Moscow staffers Friday. "[If the proposal does
go through]{.underline}," said Russian foreign affairs analyst Vladimir
Frolov, "[we \[Russia\] will cry foul and raise propaganda hell, but we
will not move a single tank.]{.underline} Arming Kiev will not affect
Russia's negotiating position in the Minsk process, but it will likely
freeze this conflict for good."

#### US arms sales to Ukraine would not have an impact

Ukraine: Get Over It,\" Military,

[Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Friday that the U.S. decision to
[supply \"defensive\" weapons to
Ukraine](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/12/23/us-officials-say-lethal-weapons-headed-ukraine.html),
possibly including
[Javelin](http://www.military.com/equipment/fgm-148-javelin) anti-tank
missiles, should be no cause of alarm for the Russians.]{.underline}
\"Hopefully, [it won\'t have an impact\" on the tense relations between
Ukraine and Moscow over Russia\'s support for separatists in eastern
Ukraine, Mattis said. \"They\'re defensive weapons,\"]{.underline}
Mattis said of the arms for Ukraine that reportedly include Javelins and
anti-aircraft weapons. In an informal year-end session with Pentagon
reporters, [Mattis also said there were no intentions to increase the
small U.S. troop presence in Ukraine, where U.S. troops have been
training Ukraine forces well away from the frontlines in eastern
Ukraine.]{.underline} \"As you know, we have some trainers there \--
training to NATO standards,\" Mattis said. \"There\'s not plan to change
that number at all \-- as long as no one wants to invade Ukraine. I
don\'t see any evolving U.S. military role in Ukraine right now.\" The
provision of [defensive weapons to Ukraine has long been backed by the
Defense Department,]{.underline} but the Obama administration withheld
approval and the Trump administration also initially was reluctant to
sanction a deal that could antagonize Russia.

### Arms solve Donbass

#### Arms sales to the Ukraine deter Russia and solve the crisis in Donbass

Adam **Reichardt &** Maksym **Khylko**, 9-19-**2017**, \"Why Arming
Ukraine Would End the Deadlock in the Donbas,\" Atlantic Council,
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-arming-ukraine-would-end-the-deadlock-in-the-donbas>
JEJP

Signals from the Trump administration are beginning to indicate a new
direction in the United States' support of Ukraine. At the end of
August, [Secretary of Defense James Mattis stated that the Pentagon is
"actively reviewing" the issue of defensive weapons, rightly noting that
"defensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor, and
clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor since it is their own territory
where the fighting is happening."]{.underline} [Arming Ukraine would
enable the United States to directly support an independent Ukraine and
add to the overall security of Europe]{.underline}. Yet it goes without
saying that such a move needs to be done intelligently and with the
specific aim of improving the situation. Clearly, the United States and
its allies in Europe do not want a military confrontation with Russia,
especially with a possible conflict with North Korea looming on the
horizon. And here lies the most important point in [providing defensive
weapons to Ukraine: they would act as a **deterrent against Russian
encroachment further into Ukrainian territory, not a
provocation**. ]{.underline}Several op-eds have recently argued against
this policy. The Wilson Center's Michael
Kofman [argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/opinion/united-states-arm-ukraine-missiles.html) in
the New York Times that arming Ukraine would drag the United States into
a proxy war with Russia, one it cannot win. He compares the plan for
Ukraine with US policy of arming and training the opposition in Syria.
Such an erroneous, even outrageous, comparison should almost immediately
discredit Kofman's arguments. L. Todd Wood in The Washington Times [went
even
further](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/29/trump-putin-ukraine-reaganobama/),
misleadingly comparing the arming of Ukraine with "arming Texas against
the United States," and adding unfounded speculations about a war
between the United States and Russia over Ukraine. [Ukraine is not
Syria, nor is it Texas, and the conflict it is involved in is with an
outside aggressor. It is not engaged in a civil war, nor is it fighting
non-state actors like ISIS. Simply put, it is in a struggle for its own
survival as a European state with Western principles, values, and
politics]{.underline}. The constant flow of weapons and military support
from Russia to the conflict zone continuously violates the ceasefire,
causing casualties among the Ukrainian military and peaceful civilians
in the Donbas. [Providing defensive weapons to Ukraine will not provoke
an arms race, since Moscow has already provided fighters in the Donbas
with its most modern and advanced weapons. Moreover, enhancing Kyiv's
defensive capabilities will not lead to a direct US-Russia
conflict]{.underline}, because Ukraine has no plans to attack Russian
territory, and the United States will not send its troops to fight in
Ukraine. Instead, [defensive weapons can help Ukraine more effectively
defend its territory and citizens, deprive Russian forces in the Donbas
of their current technical advantages, and ultimately force Moscow to
think twice before escalating further]{.underline}. [It is no
coincidence that shortly after the talks about arming Ukraine
intensified, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia's
readiness to agree to a UN peacekeeping mission in the
Donbas]{.underline}---an idea that Moscow had been rejecting for years.
[Supporting Ukraine's defensive abilities would also further reinforce
NATO's existing strategy of deterrence in the region.]{.underline}
Therefore, a strong argument exists for arming Ukraine with defensive
weapons. But by doing so, the Trump administration should add five
conditions to this policy. First and foremost, a rigorous process of
training and oversight must be put in place to ensure that the weapons
are used correctly and remain in the proper hands. Second, the financial
aspect of weapon supplies should combine different mechanisms including
free technical assistance, instalments, and loans. Third, the provision
of arms should be closely connected to the progress of Ukraine's ongoing
reforms, including in the armed forces. Ukraine's survival depends not
only on its capacity to protect itself against external aggression, but
also on its ability to successfully complete its transformation from a
post-Soviet, inefficient, corrupt state to a modern European nation.
Fourth, the United States and the EU should continue their strong
support of Ukraine's civil society as the most persistent promoter of
reforms and best watchdog of government effectiveness. Fifth, a tougher
sanctions package should remain on the table to make it clear to the
Kremlin that any possible attempts to seize more Ukrainian territory
will cost it dearly. It is time to abandon hope that a policy of
appeasement can bring peace. On the contrary, appeasement makes the
situation even more unpredictable and tenuous. [The Kremlin is
conducting one of Russia's largest military drills in the post-Soviet
era, Zapad-2017---flexing its muscles and displaying its military plans
for NATO states.]{.underline} At the same time, Putin's veiled ally in
Pyongyang is testing his ability to attack American territory with
nuclear arms. [This situation requires a firm response---one not meant
to provoke but to send a clear statement to Russia and other regimes
that the years of President Barack Obama's "flexibility" are
over.]{.underline} This message must convey, above all, that the United
States and its allies will tolerate no more attempts at toppling the
world order.

### No US-Russia War

#### No US-Russia war -- low probability of success and low profit disincentivizes russia

**Harari 17** (Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli historian and a professor in
the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem., June
23, 2017, 6-23-2017, \"Why It's No Longer Possible for Any Country to
Win a War,\" Time,
https://time.com/4826856/russia-trump-north-korea-china-war/#ob-player)

[The only recent successful war waged by a major power has been the
Russian conquest of the
[Crimea](https://time.com/4672142/russia-books/item/beyond-crimea-the-new-russian-empire/).
However, it was made possible by an extraordinary set of
circumstances]{.underline}: The Ukrainian army showed no resistance;
other powers refrained from intervening; and the Crimean population
either supported the invaders or peacefully accepted the conquest as a
fait accompli. [These circumstances will be hard to
reproduce.]{.underline} If the precondition for a successful war is the
absence of any enemies willing to resist, it limits the available
opportunities. [Indeed, when Russia sought to reproduce its Crimean
success in other parts of the Ukraine, it encountered substantially
stiffer opposition]{.underline}, and the war in eastern
[Ukraine](https://time.com/4710602/kiev-kremlin-narrowing-options-ukraine/)
bogged down into an unproductive stalemate. Conquering decrepit
Soviet-era factories in Luhansk and Donetsk hardly pays for the war, and
it certainly does not offset the costs of international sanctions. The
conquest of
[Crimea](https://time.com/3749811/crimea-russia-annexation-anniversary/)
notwithstanding, it seems that in the twenty-first century the most
successful strategy is to keep your peace and let others do the fighting
for you. Why has it become so difficult for major powers to wage
successful wars? [One reason is the change in the nature of the economy.
In the past, if you defeated your enemy on the battlefield, you could
easily cash in by looting enemy cities, selling enemy civilians in the
slave markets and occupying valuable wheat fields and gold mines. Yet in
the twenty-first century, only puny profits could be made that
way.]{.underline} Today, the main economic assets consist of technical
and institutional knowledge --- and you cannot conquer knowledge through
war. An organization such as ISIS may flourish by looting cities and oil
wells in the Middle East --- in 2014,
[ISIS](http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-making-50-million-a-month-from-oil-sales-2015-10)
seized more than \$500 million from Iraqi banks and in 2015 made an
additional \$500 million from selling oil. But
[China](https://time.com/4827923/james-mattis-china-north-korea/) and
the U.S. are unlikely to start a war for a paltry billion. As for
spending trillions of dollars on a war against the U.S., how could China
repay these expenses and balance all the war damages and lost trade
opportunities? Would the victorious People's Liberation Army loot the
riches of Silicon Valley? True, corporations such as Apple, Facebook and
Google are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but you cannot seize
these fortunes by force. There are no silicon mines in Silicon Valley.
[A successful war could theoretically still bring huge profits by
enabling the victor to rearrange the global trade system in its favor,
as the U.S. did after its victory over Hitler. However, present-day
military technology would make it extremely difficult to repeat this
feat.]{.underline} By definition, profits large enough to make a global
war worthwhile for the victor will also make it worthwhile for the loser
to resort to weapons of mass destruction. The atom bomb has turned
"victory" in a World War into collective suicide. It is no coincidence
that since Hiroshima superpowers never fought one another directly, and
engaged only in what (for them) were low-stake conflicts in which none
was tempted to use nuclear weapons to avert defeat. Indeed, even
attacking a second-rate nuclear power such as Iran or North Korea is an
extremely unattractive proposition. [Cyber
warfare](https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2016-hackers-runner-up/)
makes things even worse for would-be imperialists. As recently as the
days of [George W.
Bush](https://time.com/4738495/george-w-bush-foreign-aid/), the U.S.
could wreak havoc in far-off Fallujah while the Iraqis had no means of
retaliating against San Francisco. But if the U.S. now attacks a country
possessing even moderate cyber warfare capabilities, malware and logic
bombs could stop air traffic in Dallas, cause trains to collide in
Philadelphia and bring down the electric grid in Michigan. [In the great
age of conquerors, warfare was a low-damage, high-profit
affair.]{.underline} At the battle of Hastings in 1066, William the
Conqueror gained the whole of England in a single day for the cost of a
few thousand dead. [Nuclear weapons and cyber warfare, by contrast, are
high-damage, low-profit technologies]{.underline}. You could use such
tools to destroy entire countries, but not to build profitable empires.
Hence in a world filling up with saber-rattling and bad vibes, perhaps
[our best guarantee of peace is that major powers aren't familiar with
any recent example of a successful war.]{.underline} While Genghis Khan
or Julius Caesar would invade a foreign country at the drop of a hat,
[present-day strongmen talk loud but are very careful about actually
launching wars]{.underline}.

#### Russia would not initiate an attack on the US and US-Russia relations now will prevent a war

in response to an incoming]{.underline} missile [attack]{.underline}.
[He voiced confidence that Russia could resist Western pressure and
expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump eventually would move to
repair fractured ties with Russia.]{.underline} Speaking at an
international policy forum in Sochi, Putin noted that [Russia's military
doctrine](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/09/13/if-russia-started-world-war-iii-heres-how-it-would-go-down/)
doesn't envisage a preventative nuclear strike. [He said Moscow only
would tap its nuclear arsenal if early warning systems spotted missiles
heading toward Russia. \"Only when we become convinced that there is an
incoming attack on the territory of Russia, and that happens within
seconds, only after that we would launch a retaliatory strike,\" he said
during a panel discussion at the forum.]{.underline} \"It would
naturally mean a global catastrophe, but I want to emphasize that we
can\'t be those who initiate it because we don\'t foresee a preventive
strike,\" Putin said. \"The aggressor should know that retaliation is
inevitable, and he will be destroyed.\" \"We would be victims of an
aggression and would get to heaven as martyrs,\" while those who
initiated the aggression would \"just die and not even have time to
repent,\" he added. The Russian leader also warned that new hypersonic
missiles his country developed give it a [military
edge](http://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/ausa/2018/10/16/updated-army-missile-defense-strategy-in-works-to-address-peer-threats/).
\"We have run ahead of the competition. No one has precision hypersonic
weapons,\" he said. \"Others are planning to start testing them within
the next 1½ to 2 years, and we already have them on duty.\" Russia
already has deployed the Kinzhal hypersonic missile. Putin said that
another new weapon, the Avangard, is set to enter service in the next
few months. Earlier this year, Putin said the Avangard has an
intercontinental range and can fly in the atmosphere at a speed 20 times
the speed of sound, making it capable of piercing any missile defense
system. His blunt talk Thursday comes as Russia-West relations remain
frosty over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and the allegations
of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential vote. [Putin said he
still hoped Trump would be able to improve the ties between their
countries. He thinks Trump wants \"some sort of stabilization and
improvement of U.S.-Russian ties\" and said Moscow is ready for that
\"at any moment.\" Putin said his]{.underline} [[meeting with Trump in

### Nuclear War No Impact -- No Nuclear Winter

#### Nuclear winter empirically disproven

**Walker 2018** (Robert Walker, first class honours degree in Maths from
York university ,PhD at Wolfson College Oxford, lol not the Trump space
advisor one, 2018, \"Debunked: Nuclear Winter and Radioactive
Fallou\...,\" No Publication,
https://debunkingdoomsday.quora.com/Debunked-Nuclear-Winter-and-Radioactive-Fallout-myths)

[There are many online pages and websites that seem very authoritative
that say that even a limited nuclear war, say between India and
Pakistan, would plunge the Earth into a 'Nuclear winter']{.underline}
with no crops able to grow, no plants, no animals, and people soon
starving to extinction. [This is politically motivated and based on out
of date or junk science.]{.underline} I am very much in favour of
nuclear disarmament so I'm strongly in favour of the political views
that motivate these people. I go so far as to argue that the UK should
disarm unilaterally, and should never use its nuclear weapons under any
circumstances. This is a similar view to the Scottish National Party and
Jeremy Corbyn though he has not persuaded his party to adopt this
stance, see my [Is Corbyn Right About The Bomb?- Op
Ed](http://www.science20.com/robert_inventor/is_corbyn_right_about_the_bomb_op_ed-180465).
But I think people need to know the truth and make decisions based on
truth. I think it is important to speak up when a view is widely
publicized that just about all scientists believe to be false, based on
poorly supported research that they think will lead politicians to
desired actions. Even if it has good political effects. In this case as
well, [it is]{.underline} also [scaring people unnecessarily who are
afraid that even a small nuclear war could plunge us all into a deep
freeze. No, it would not, and the research suggesting this is
fundamentally flawed and based on out of date ideas. The expert
scientists involved are sure that the older nuclear winter models were
incorrect, based on their failed predictions for the Kuwaiti oil fires
which they predicted would harm agriculture over much of Asia but it
only had local short term effects]{.underline}. There were many who were
skeptical all along, but that was what persuaded nearly all of the ones
who still thought it was possible that their models were wrong. There is
one notable remaining nuclear winter proponent, Robok, who along with
various co-authors publishes articles that are widely publicized because
of their dramatic conclusions. However these predictions are not only
not well received by other climate researchers, they are generally
regarded as incorrect due to fundamental flaws in the assumptions his
models are based on. The researchers who say this make assumptions that
they can\'t prove and that everyone else in the field has said long ago
don\'t work. [Carl Sagan gave up on the nuclear winter hypothesis after
the Kuwaiti oil field fires and just about everyone else]{.underline}
except Robok [agreed with him.]{.underline} SUMMARY The nuclear winter
predictions date back to some predictions in the 1970s based on their
limited crude models on slow computers (by modern standards) with hardly
any memory, just kilobytes. They tried to model what would happen to the
soot from fires in cities during a nuclear war. They concluded that it
would be lofted so high into the atmosphere that it would get above all
the normal weather and linger there for a decade, nearly blocking out
the sun completely world wide. Their predictions were so dramatic that a
\'nuclear winter\' is an understatement. Average world temperature -25
C. You are talking about the ocean freezing even right to the tropics,
for ten years. It\'s no wonder that they gave it that name. It had the
support by highly respected scientist. One of the authors of the
original paper was Carl Sagan. But the [models were based on flawed
assumptions. Even at the time they were questioned. Nowadays just about
all scientists involved, including ones that supported the hypothesis
originally, are agreed that it would have little effect. It might no
effect on temperature at all, except for a brief reduction of
temperature locally during the fire itself as it turns day to night
temporarily - since after all we have large areas burnt in wildfires
every year with no effect.]{.underline} The [scientists who did the
nuclear winter work realized they had made a mistake in the modeling
after the Kuwaiti oil fires. When the oil fields were left burning by
the retreating troops, they predicted dire consequences for agriculture
througout Asia. Instead it shaded out a small part of the gulf area with
a slight reduction of temperature (similar to night time) for the
duration of the fires]{.underline} (several months). This showed that
there was something wrong with their models. After looking into it in
more detail [they decided that the soot doesn\'t rise nearly as high as
they predicted in the atmosphere, and it tends to get washed out within
days by rain.]{.underline} The combined effect is that the darkening is
temporary and local instead of long term and global. So, nearly all
scientists agreed on this, but [Alan Robock published a paper in Physics
Today in which he claimed that an all out exchange between Pakistan and
India, of, say, 100 nuclear weapons would cool the Earth on average by a
few degrees. The science in this paper was good except that he started
it already pre-loaded with soot in the upper atmosphere]{.underline}.
Remember the very reason the early models got discredited is because
soot doesn't rise as high as expected in the Kuwaiti oil fires. Nor does
it with wildfires or the fires from the Dreden bombing - and Hiroshima
and Nagasaki didn't have fire storms at all. This paper doesn't even
discuss this question. [It simply pre-loads the atmosphere with soot in
the upper atmosphere, and from then on it follows the consequences. But
that is the very point at contention - whether the soot would end up so
high in the atmosphere. Everyone is agreed that there would be serious
consequences if this happened but the evidence is that it can't get
there after the fires started in a nuclear war.]{.underline}

The only recent paper researching into the soot rising into the
atmosphere is in agreement that [significant cooling after a limited

[\"Due to the heat of the fire and of the BC particles that are
produced, some of the particles are lofted into the stratosphere.
However, our comprehensive urban fire simulations indicate that the bulk
of the carbon mass remains in the troposphere, where it is quickly
removed from the atmosphere]{.underline}. In most previous work, for
example, that of Stenke et al. (2013) and Mills et al. (2014), all of
the soot produced by the urban fires is directly injected near the top
of the troposphere, and therefore much of it rises into the
stratosphere, where it shades and cools the Earth. In contrast, if we
use a realistic vertical profile for the BC aerosols as input to the
climate model, the long‐term global impacts on climate are much less
severe than predicted by previous studies. This was true even with
conservative, worst case assumptions regarding BC production. \...\"

cooling from a limited exchange scenario as envisioned in previous

The soot from a nuclear bomb is just soot from ordinary fires similar to
that from e.g. the Dresden firestorm or the other carpet bombings of
Japanese cities in the war before Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Some dust and
smoke does go up during the initial mushroom cloud but the fires which
were the basis of the nuclear winter hypothesis haven\'t started yet at
that point. They calculate in that paper that less than a hundredth of
the total material that gets into the upper atmosphere above 5 km comes
from this stage of the explosion. Lundquist and Robock are researching
into this stage of the process but haven't published their research yet.
[Nuclear winter is still a hot topic as a new arms race heats
up](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/8/18212021/nuclear-war-winter-climate-changes-russia-north-korea-tactical-nuke-inf-treaty)
Lundquist's summary of her reason for researching into this is "I think
it's important to let policy makers know that there could be very big
consequences to political choices," she says. "So even if it's not very
likely, it could be devastating." So they also admit the possibility
that it might not be very likely. NO NUCLEAR WINTER This was the big bug
bear during the cold war. Carl Sagan and others calculated that an all
out nuclear war, both the explosions themselves and the firestorms they
created, would put so much dust into the upper atmosphere that it would
cool the entire Earth for several years afterwards in a nuclear winter.
The idea of a [nuclear winter]{.underline} goes back to a 1983
[paper](http://www.bioinfo.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/fileadmin/07030400/Science-1990-Turco-166-76_1_globalNuclear.pdf)
predicting an average world temperature of -25 C following a global
nuclear war. This is for an all out exchange of the nuclear weapons of
US and Russia during the cold war. This [is based on work with early
primitive 1D models and very low resolution 3D models and based on many
assumptions about how smoke from the fires would move in the
atmosphere]{.underline}. These models had a lot of influence on thinking
about the cold war and were widely respected and believed at the time,
by the likes of Carl Sagan etc. Carl Sagan is a co-author. Here is an
early interview with him warning about the potentially serious effects
and saying that scientists had come together and were in general
agreement about it. However later their [models were proved to be wrong
with the Kuwaiti oil fires which did not behave as they predicted. Even
at the time there was a fair bit of skepticism with some scientists
writing that they thought that the ones who proposed a nuclear winter
were politically motivated. Not that they were deceiptful of course,
just that perhaps they were more easily persuaded by not such strong
evidence due to their political persuasions about nuclear
war.]{.underline} For instance there is a very skeptical paper from
1986, published in Nature, just 3 years after the Sagan paper: Emanuel,
K. A. [\"Nuclear winter: Towards a scientific
exercise.\"](http://ftp/texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/nuclear.pdf)
Nature 319.6051 (1986): 259-259. He says that following a model by
Golding the soot would rise at 20 cm / second which is enough so that
even in dry air, water would condense out and wash the soot out of the
atmosphere before it got high enough to become a continent wide pall in
the upper atmosphere (the moisture would condense out similarly to the
way cummulus clouds form above rising air on a sunny day). [Seitz was
another early skeptic, writing in the same year
(1986)](http://www.textfiles.com/survival/nkwrmelt.txt): "As the science
progressed and more authentic sophistication was achieved in newer and
more elegant models, the postulated effects headed downhill. By 1986,
these worst-case effects had melted down from a year of arctic darkness
to warmer temperatures than the cool months in [Palm
Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida)! A new
[paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm) of broken clouds and
cool spots had emerged. The once global hard
[frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost) had retreated back to the
northern [tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra). Mr. Sagan\'s
elaborate conjecture had fallen prey to
[Murphy\'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_Law) lesser-known
Second Law: If everything MUST go wrong, don\'t bet on it." Those views
were not widely accepted at the time. But eventually just about
everyone, including Carl Sagan, came to change their views on nuclear
winter, within six years of him writing that. So what happened? Well -
their calculations turned out to be accurate for asteroid impacts. This
is a significant issue though not an extinction causing one, for large
asteroid impacts. They are also accurate for supervolcanoes which lift
large amounts of ash into the upper atmosphere, not enough to cause a
nuclear winter but enough for a supervolcano autumn. Their models are
still accepted for both those scenarios. But several things happened to
cast doubt on their calculations for nuclear weapons. First it's
important to realize, their models are not based on the idea of the
immediate effects of the nuclear weapons. The explosion itself doesn't
loft anything like enough material to be of concern. That makes it
different from an asteroid impact or volcanic eruption. Their model was
instead based on the idea that the nuclear weapons would cause large
scale fire storms in urban areas. They predicted that this soot, from
ordinary fires, but very large ones, would be lofted up into the upper
atmosphere. This is what they later came to realize was based on flawed
reasoning and over simple models. In particular, when the Iraqis
retreated after their invasion of Kuwait, then they set many oil wells
alight. These created dense black smoke that turned day to night over
large areas As reported for instance in the [Baltimore
times:](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan)
Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan says Saddam Hussein\'s orders
to torch Kuwaiti oil wells, if carried far enough, could unleash smoke
clouds that would disrupt agriculture across South Asia and darken skies
around the world. \"You need a very small lowering of the average
temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere to have serious consequences for
agriculture,\" Sagan said. Scientists in Maryland and Colorado say such
a disaster would require fires at hundreds of wells burning for months,
but they agreed the potential exists in Kuwait for a \"very
catastrophic\" environmental event. Saddam Hussein of course did set the
oil wells alight - and hundreds of them too. At the time then there were
worries they would burn for five years. And there were 610 fires (others
say 750) burnt uncontrolled from [February through to May
1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_oil_fires) at which point
the thousands of fire fighters had their equipment in place and began to
put them out. Here is how they did it: Longer video
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1vonQiadkM) To begin with there
were a lot of days when it was totally dark. And when you could see the
sky it didn't last for more than a few minutes and it was total darknes
again. It was exactly the sort of scenario they had predicted for a
nuclear winter, and they'd have expected at least major cooling effects
and immense disruption of agriculture over most of Asia. But it didn't
have the widespread effects the scientists had expected. As [Carl
Sagan](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/Carl_Sagan.htm)wrote
in his Demon Haunted World, page 257: \"it was pitch black at noon and
temperatures dropped 4--6 °C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke
reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared." For more about
this background see the section in Wikidia's [Carl Sagan - Scientific
and critical thinking
advocacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan#Scientific_and_critical_thinking_advocacy)
This lead to them re-evaluating the models that lead to the nuclear
winter prediction, which were rather crude, making many assumptions and
approximations. They couldn't be right to have got the predictions about
the Kuwaiti oil fires so very wrong. [The conclusion nowadays is that
nuclear weapons most likely would not cause firestorms in cities, if
they did, the smoke would rarely reach higher than 4 km. Also much more
of Earth burns in wild fires every year without putting us into a
nuclear winter scenario. Also modern nuclear bombs are smaller than they
used to be. Both US and Russia have eliminated all bombs of more than
one megaton. Only China has them now, with about 50 of them. To get the
dust high enough for nuclear winter, above 70,000 feet you'd need bombs
with yields much more than a megaton. Modern bombs would only throw the
debris up to 60,000 to 70,000 feet which means the debris will rain to
Earth within hours or days close to the point of impact.]{.underline}
Our nuclear arsenals are also much smaller than they were at the time of
the nuclear winter calculations. So [in short, nuclear winter was based
on poor science, as it turned out (refuted by the Kuwaiti fires), and
probably even at the height of the cold war, we would not have been
plunged into a nuclear winter. As it is now, certainly not.]{.underline}
NUCLEAR WINTER, NUCLEAR AUTUMN, OR NO GLOBAL CLIMATE EFFECTS? So in
short, [nowadays most scientists who have researched into this say that
even at the height of the cold war, we would not have been plunged into
a nuclear winter]{.underline}.

### Nuke War Good -- Solves Warming

#### Nuke war good -- Only method that can solve warming

[The global economy is a vast machine, operating beyond the control of
even the most powerful individuals, and it has a will of its own to
consume and pollute]{.underline}. It's hard to believe that this massive
metal beast will be peacefully undone by the people who survive by it,
and we all survive by it in some way, often against our wills; it bribes
and entraps us all in ways large and small. But a wrench could clog the
gears, and maybe only a wrench can stop it. [One wrench that could slow
climate disruption may be a large-scale conflict that halts the global
economy, destroys fossil fuel infrastructure, and throws particulates in
the air.]{.underline} At this point, with insane people like Trump,
Putin, Xi, May, and Macron leading the world's biggest nuclear powers,
large-scale conflagration between them would probably lead to a nuclear
exchange. Nobody wants nuclear war. Rather, nobody sane and prosocial
wants nuclear war. It is an absolute horror that would burn and maim
millions of living beings, despoil millions of hectares, and scar the
skin of the earth and dome of the sky for centuries, maybe millennia.
With proxy conflict brewing between the US and Russia in the Middle East
and the [Thucydides
trap](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/09/the-thucydides-trap/) ready to
ensnare us with an ascendant China, nuclear war looks like a more
realistic possibility than it has since the 1980s. [A devastating fact
of climate collapse is that there may be a silver lining to the mushroom
cloud. First, it should be noted that a nuclear exchange does not
inevitably result in apocalyptic loss of life. Nuclear
winter]{.underline}---the idea that firestorms would make the earth
uninhabitable---[is based on shaky science. There's no reliable model
that can determine how many megatons would decimate agriculture or make
humans extinct.]{.underline} [Nations have already detonated 2,476
nuclear devices. An exchange that shuts down the global economy but
stops short of human extinction may be the only blade realistically
likely to cut the carbon knot we're trapped within. It would decimate
existing infrastructures, providing an opportunity to build new energy
infrastructure and intervene in the current investments and subsidies
keeping fossil fuels alive.]{.underline} In the near term, emissions
would almost certainly rise as militaries are some of the world's
[largest
emitters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/01/climate/us-biggest-carbon-polluter-in-history-will-it-walk-away-from-the-paris-climate-deal.html).
Given what we know of human history, though, c[onflict may be the only
way to build the mass social cohesion necessary for undertaking the kind
of huge, collective action needed for global sequestration and energy
transition.]{.underline} Like the 20th century's world wars, [a nuclear
exchange could serve as an economic leveler. It could provide
justification for nationalizing energy industries with the interest of
shuttering fossil fuel plants and transitioning to renewables
and]{.underline}, uh, [nuclear energy. It could shock us into
reimagining a less suicidal civilization, one that dethrones the
death-cult zealots who are currently in power. And it may toss
particulates into the atmosphere sufficient to block out some of the
solar heat helping to drive global warming.]{.underline} Or it may have
the opposite effects. Who knows? What we do know is that [humans can
survive and recover from war, probably even a nuclear one. Humans cannot
recover from runaway climate change]{.underline}. Nuclear war is not an
inevitable extinction event; six degrees of warming is. Given that
mostly violent, psychopathic individuals manage the governments and
industries of the world, it may only be possible for anti-social
collective action---that is, war---to halt, or at least slow, our
inexorable march toward oblivion. A courageous, benevolent ruler might
compel vast numbers of people to collective action. But we have too few
of those, and the legal, political, and military barriers preventing
them from rising are immense. Our current crop of villainous presidents,
prime ministers, and CEOs, whether lusting for chaos or pursuing their
own petty ends, may inadvertently conspire to break the machine now
preventing our future. When so bereft of heroes, [we may need to rely on
humanity's antagonists and their petty incompetence to accidentally save
the day.]{.underline} It is a stark reflection of how homicidal our
economy is---and our collective adherence to its whims---that [nuclear
war could be a rational course of action.]{.underline}

### Industry Strong Now

#### Ukraine's defense industry is strong now

John **Pike**, 3-28-**2014**, worked for nearly two decades with the
Federation of American Scientists, where he directed the Space Policy,
Cyberstrategy, Military Analysis, Nuclear Resource and Intelligence
Resource projects, favorite bible quote: \"The wicked flee when no man
pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.\" Proverbs 28:1,

JEJP

Ukraine inherited one-third of the Soviet defense industry ? 1,840
enterprises and research centers that employed 2.7 million people. Some
facilities had unique capabilities such as shipbuilding and missile
production. However, it was not a coherent national defense sector per
se, but a fragmented collection of what used to be the mammoth Soviet
military-industrial complex, which had to be transformed into the
national defense sector of Ukraine. [**The military-industrial complex
of Ukraine is the most advanced and developed branch of the state\'s
sector of economy**. Ukraine\'s formidable defense industry, which
employed more than one million people and produced cutting-edge hardware
like the Morozov Design Bureau\'s new BTR-4 and the AN-70. It includes
about 85 scientific organizations which are specialized in the
development of armaments and military equipment for different usage. The
air and space complex consists of 18 design bureaus and 64 enterprises.
In order to design and build ships and armaments for the Ukrainian Navy,
15 research and development institutes, 40 design bureaus and 67 plants
have been brought together]{.underline}. This complex is tasked to
design heavy cruisers, build missile cruisers and big antisubmarine
warfare (ASW) cruisers, develop small ASW ships. [Rocketry and missilery
equipment, rockets, missiles, projectiles, and other munitions are
designed and made at 6 design bureaus and 28 plants.]{.underline}
[Ukraine has certain scientific, technical and industrial basis for the
indigenous research, development and production of small arms. A number
of scientific-industrial corporations have started R&D and production of
small arms.]{.underline} The armor equipment is designed and
manufactured at 3 design bureaus and 27 plants. [The scientific and
industrial potential of Ukraine makes it possible to create and produce
modern technical means of military communications and automated control
systems at 2 scientific-research institutes and 13 plants]{.underline}.
A total of 2 scientific-research institutes and 53 plants produce power
supply batteries; 3 scientific-research institutes and 6 plants
manufacture intelligence and radio-electronic warfare equipment; 4
design bureaus and 27 plants make engineer equipment and materiel. In
June 2012 [Ukraine's Parliament released defense enterprises from the
need to comply with public procurement law and associated tender
procedures. Supporters claimed the move will improve these enterprises'
ability to gain state defense orders and strengthen Ukraine's
competitive position as a top world's arms exporter]{.underline}. The
Director General of the state-owned defense industry conglomerate
UkrOboronProm, Dmytro Peregudov, commented that [this move will
significantly increase the international competitiveness of Ukraine's
defense industry, as in the past Ukrainian enterprises often lost
prospective contracts due to the time and resources spent on meeting
mandatory tender procedures]{.underline}. The new law also prohibited
publication of information on procurement of military products, weapons,
components, and spare parts with the justification that the publication
of such information could threaten Ukraine's national security and
undermine the promotion of Ukrainian goods on the world market.

for years and even decades -- everything from gear and firearms
to [cruise
missiles](https://defence-blog.com/missiles/ukraine-conducts-successful-flight-test-neptun-cruise-missile.html).
Of the \$3bn budget for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense in

go](http://euromaidanpress.com/2018/01/19/five-projects-which-will-strengthen-the-ukrainian-army-in-the-new-year/) on
new weaponry and technology.]{.underline} Here we publish the latest
updates on the most significant domestic military projects.
[The[ Bars-8MMK](http://bogdan.ua/en/mortar-complex-ukr-mmc-basis-bars-8mmk-entered-rating-ukrainian-defense-industry-achievements) is
a mobile mortar complex on the Bars-8 armored vehicle chassis equipped
with a 120-mm mortar 2B11, and has an operational range of up to
7.2km]{.underline}. The complex can carry 60 shells.
It[ takes](http://ukroboronprom.com.ua/en/media/mobilnyj-minometnyj-kompleks-bars-8mmk-demonstratsiya-roboty-na-zbroyi-ta-bezpetsi.html) 30
or[ 60](http://www.rnbo.gov.ua/news/3144.html) seconds to bring the
complex to combat readiness, and only 20 seconds to leave the position
after the final shot. The Bars-8MMK was designed for an effective
counter-battery fire and is equipped with a firing control system. The
Bars-8MMK was first showcased at the "Arms and Security-2017" exhibition
in Kyiv and the complex is currently[ undergoing state
testing](http://www.rnbo.gov.ua/news/3144.html). If it passes the tests,
it will enter service in the Ukrainian Army. [The 1L221E is a
counter-battery radar system which is currently being developed by one
of the subsidiaries of UkrOboronProm, the giant state-owned defense
conglomerate]{.underline}. The system will be capable of precisely
locating enemy artillery weapons, identifying the projectile type
(shells, rockets), and tracking the trajectory of the incoming threat.
Another feature of the system is tracking the airspace to fix the
unmanned aerial aircraft he 1L221E uses the same radar as
the [1L220UK](https://defence-blog.com/army/ukraine-develops-new-mobile-weapon-locating-system.html) mobile
weapon locating system known as "Zoopark-2" which was shown at the[ 2018
Independence Day
parade](http://euromaidanpress.com/2018/08/25/military-gear-adapted-to-nato-standards-and-other-novelties-at-ukraines-independence-day-parade/) in
Kyiv. Unlike the 1L220UK which is mounted on a towed trailer, the 1L221E
will fully fit on an 8×8 truck chassis, which will significantly reduce
the unfolding time and increase its mobility. [Vilkha is a rocket
complex with 300mm guided ammunition developed by the Luch State Kyiv
Design Bureau. The complex was made on the basis of the BM-30 Smerch
multiple-launch rocket system]{.underline}. The Ukrainian Army has put

mobile short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile system. Its
rockets are being developed by Yuzhnoye Design Office, and Makarov
Southern Machine-Building Plant is developing the chassis. The new
missile's operational
distance [ranges](https://economics.unian.info/2329504-ukraine-unveils-new-hrim-2-short-range-ballistic-missile-photos.html) from
50 to 280 km with the[ possibility of

### No Proliferation

#### Ukraine will not pursue nuclear proliferation to solidify international perception as friendly

On Dec. 25, 1991, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced his
resignation and [handed
off](https://www.amazon.com/Moscow-December-25-1991-Soviet/dp/1610391985#reader_1610391985) his
nuclear strike authorization unit, the so-called Cheget briefcase, to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. With this final act, the Soviet Union
was no more. What remained, however, was Soviet Union's gargantuan
nuclear arsenal and the military-industrial complex that produced it.
The problem was that now it was situated not in one, but in four
sovereign states: Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. This
unprecedented development [spurred
fears](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault-nunn-lugar-russia-programs/2016-12-12/nunn-lugar-25th-anniversary-shows) that
the biggest wave of nuclear proliferation in history was in the offing,
fears that fortunately failed to materialize. Amid proliferation gloom
about [North
Korea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/09/north-korea-wont-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-the-u-s-has-3-good-reasons-to-talk-anyway/?utm_term=.01f179594eb9), [Iran](http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/04/05/if-trump-blows-up-the-deal-iran-gets-the-bomb/),
and possibly [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/15/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-nuclear-weapons-intl/index.html),
it seems fitting to recall past nonproliferation successes. Ukraine's
case is the most instructive of the Soviet nuclear inheritors. [The
United States and its allies formulated an expectation that only one
nuclear state should emerge from the Soviet collapse, and everyone
understood that state to be Russia. While Belarus and, after a short
hesitation, Kazakhstan complied with this expectation, Ukraine followed
a more convoluted and difficult path.]{.underline} Ukraine's initial
intention to become a nuclear-free state, recorded in its [1990
Declaration of
Sovereignty](http://static.rada.gov.ua/site/postanova_eng/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_Ukraine_rev1.htm),
gave way to a more nuanced stance soon after the country became
independent the following year. As a successor state of the Soviet
Union, [Ukraine claimed, it was the rightful owner of what amounted to
the [world's third-largest nuclear
arsenal](http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/ukraine/) deployed on its
territory: 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) armed with
1,240 nuclear warheads and 44 strategic bombers armed with hundreds of
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.]{.underline} Heated internal
deliberations and intense international negotiations ensued. In mid-1993
it seemed far from certain that Ukraine would agree to denuclearize. Yet
by 1994, [Ukraine joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear-weapons state, proceeding to transfer all
nuclear warheads to Russia and dismantle, with U.S. technical
assistance, ICBMs, silos, bombers, and cruise missiles]{.underline}. In
exchange, the young country received compensation for fissile material
contained in warheads and [security
assurances](http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf) from
recognized nuclear states. What can we learn from Ukraine's path to
denuclearization? Bearing in mind that all historical parallels are
necessarily tenuous, we offer three insights that may help deal with
today's proliferation challenges. While Soviet weapons were less useful
than supposed, Ukraine nonetheless inherited the foundation to build its
own. But it wasn't interested. [Scholars of nuclear proliferation
tentatively [sort drivers of nuclear
acquisition](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/publications/the_causes_of_nuclear_weapons_proliferation) into
two buckets: supply-side, or technological capacity to develop nuclear
weapons, and demand-side, or political motivations to do
so.]{.underline} In enforcing the nonproliferation regime, [the United
States and its allies have focused on controlling the supply-side of
nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}:[ buttressing](https://www.iaea.org/topics/additional-protocol) the
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards
regime, [discouraging](http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/01/its-not-as-easy-as-1-2-3/) states
from pursuit of indigenous enrichment capacity, instituting and
enforcing [export
controls](http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/en/) for sensitive
technology, [and [going
after](http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/detecting-and-disrupting-illicit-nuclear-trade-after-a.q.-khan/20) illicit
trade networks]{.underline}. This is good and necessary work. Yet
curbing nuclear proliferation is not reducible to choking a potential
proliferator's technology supply lines. The case of Ukraine underscores
that, [when it comes to nuclear proliferation, the availability of
technology is far from determinative.]{.underline} Counterintuitively,
it was not the inheritance of a cache of strategic weaponry that was the
biggest proliferation opportunity, since at the moment of Soviet
dissolution, Ukraine's strategic armaments were looped into a
centralized command and control system, the keys to which remained in
Moscow. Rather, [Ukraine's most important asset was the extent of
scientific know-how and military-industrial capacity that contributed to
the Soviet nuclear enterprise. This technological capacity would have
allowed Ukraine to establish direct control over parts of its arsenal
and complete the missing elements of the nuclear fuel cycle, had it
chosen to do so]{.underline}. Ukraine's city of Dnipropetrovsk (now
Dnipro) was home to the Yuzhnoie design bureau and the Yuzhmash missile
plant, the largest producer of ICBMs for the Soviet arsenal. Yuzhmash
produced 46 of the 176 missiles deployed in Ukraine, the SS-24s, and
could continue to maintain and modernize them. Kharkiv, an important
node in Soviet military-industrial complex, was home to Khartron, the
designer of guidance and targeting systems for SS-19 ICBMs, 130 of which
were deployed in Ukraine. Bruce Blair, writing in
1995, [estimated](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/31851048?selectedversion=NBD11533844) that,
despite technological challenges, "the initial direct costs \[for
Ukraine\] of cobbling together a deterrent force out of inherited or
seizable assets would be relatively small." [Although Ukraine lacked
uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities, fuel
fabrication, and warhead production, it mined and missile uranium ore
and operated two research and 15 civilian nuclear power
reactors]{.underline}. This included one RBMK reactor at Chernobyl, in
operation until 2000, which produced irradiated fuel rich in
weapons-grade plutonium. Ukraine had the metallurgical and chemical
expertise, precision electronics, two prominent physics institutes in
Kyiv and Kharkiv, and a heavy water plant in Driprodzerzhinsk.
Ukrainians [might also have had
access](https://books.google.com/books?id=VV6n6p-mN9sC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=Chapter+3+A+leap+over+stages+of+development&source=bl&ots=NA_xvGVWYL&sig=_9LYW-rXzS928YGV5V63WZIm0Lc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwib3rzfloTUAhWD6oMKHRT8C3kQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=Chapter%20) to
a Soviet nuclear warhead design, shared with Yuzhmash as part of a
missile development program before the Soviet collapse. A feasibility
study conducted by Ukrainian scientists in 1993 concluded that [Ukraine
had sufficient technological capacity to establish centrifuge production
and uranium enrichment in five to seven years.]{.underline} In short,
beyond weaponry, [Ukraine inherited considerable scientific,
technological, and industrial capacity that would have made an enviable
starter package for any aspiring proliferator]{.underline}. Ukraine is
not a nuclear weapons state today, not because it lacked technology or
scientific expertise, but because it lacked political motivation for a
nuclear deterrent. [Ukraine wanted international recognition, not the
isolation that would come with nuclear weapons. ]{.underline}Political
motivations that drive nuclear acquisition are notoriously difficult to
ascertain. We know that adverse security environments, status
considerations, and domestic lobby groups that benefit from a nuclear
program are [all
conducive](https://www-jstor-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/stable/2539273?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) to
nuclear proliferation. [Ukraine's story suggests that motivations for a
nuclear program are also shaped by how the country defines itself in
relation to the Western-led international order.]{.underline} After the
Soviet collapse, Ukraine found itself in a perilous security environment
as Ukrainian-Russian relations became increasingly acrimonious. [As we
found through archival research and chronicled in a recent paper,
Ukraine aspired to [be recognized
as](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/interpreting-the-bomb-ownership-and-deterrence-ukraines-nuclear-discourse) an
equal successor state to the Soviet Union, on par with Russia, and
thought this equality should obtain also in the nuclear
realm.]{.underline} [As such it demanded, successfully, to be included
as a party to the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty [(START)](http://fas.org/nuke/control/start1/)]{.underline},
signed by the United States and the Soviet Union just weeks before the
latter collapsed. Finally, Ukraine had a prominent missile lobby, which,
given that procurements from Moscow dried up following the Soviet
collapse, supported the retention of the 46 SS-24 ICBMs produced in
Ukraine and development of replacement systems after their service life
expired in early 2000s. Yet this dangerous combination of an adverse
security environment, desire for status, and domestic interests
nonetheless failed to produce a Ukrainian nuclear deterrent, because
there were equally powerful political motivations that inhibited the
acquisition of nuclear weapons. **[Had Ukraine pursued a nuclear
program, it surely would have been subject to international isolation
and sanctions that would have prevented the country's integration into
the world economy and affect Russian supply of nuclear fuel to Ukraine's
power stations]{.underline}**. Acceding to the NPT, on the other hand,
meant Ukraine could maintain its peaceful nuclear energy under
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Moreover[, Ukraine, a
fledgling sovereign emerging from a communist empire, aspired to become
a European liberal democracy and an international citizen in good
standing]{.underline}. It did not only relinquish nuclear weapons
because of what it wanted to get or avoid, but also because it wanted to
become a certain kind of state. [Threats of sanctions and isolation will
not have the same effect on those regimes that define themselves in
opposition to the Western-led international order.]{.underline} In North
Korea, for instance, sanctions have done little to thwart the autarchic
regime's determination to get a nuclear deterrent. The penalties may
even
have [backfired](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/Stopping%20North%20Korea%20Inc%20Park%20and%20Walsh%20.pdf) by
supporting the narrative of besiegement by the West and making illicit
trade networks more sophisticated. This is not to say that sanctions
should be lifted but rather that we shouldn't expect a change of heart
in Pyongyang solely because of them. On the other hand, in Iran, the
lesson from Ukraine may be that the faction of leadership that seeks
engagement with the West should be encouraged and supported --- it was,
after all, instrumental to [making a nuclear deal
possible](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&ved=0ahUKEwiW0NDHmcTaAhXxnuAKHTLtCJ8QFghjMAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpacs.einaudi.cornell.edu%2Fsites%2Fpacs%2Ffiles%2FTabatabai.Iran%2520Deal%2520and%2520Future%2520Arms%2520Control%2520Processes.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1c7GGI2nfoORtFRbaTnhZ_).
Western and Russian officials projected their own abstract deterrence
thinking. Ukrainians thought of nuclear warfare in concrete terms and
recoiled. Statesmen and analysts often become prisoners of the concepts
and modes of thinking that are most familiar to them. Western
understandings of nuclear weapons, dominated by theories of deterrence,
had difficulty explaining why countries would renounce a nuclear option.
Indeed, it was partly through the West's disproportionate attention to
the nuclear issue in Ukraine, to the exclusion of all other areas of
engagement, that Ukrainians learned the value of their nuclear
inheritance. Combined with an increasing perception of the Russian
threat, this led Ukraine to qualify its initial renunciation with a more
nuanced stance that demanded recognition of Ukraine a legitimate "owner"
of nuclear weapons as an equal successor of the Soviet Union. Russia
construed these claims as a Ukrainian bid for a nuclear deterrent.
Received wisdom in the West corroborated this suspicion --- what state
bereft of allies and facing a conventionally superior nuclear-armed
adversary wouldn't want a deterrent? In summer 1993, The Economist made
this argument in an article entitled "Ukraine: a nuclear state" and
prominent international relations scholar John
Mearsheimer [argued](http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0020.pdf) in Foreign
Affairs that Ukraine would --- and should --- keep a nuclear deterrent,
otherwise a war with Russia would be imminent. As it turns out,
Mearsheimer was eventually proven right about the war with Russia. It
seems, however, that more Westerners were thinking about a Ukrainian
nuclear deterrent than Ukrainians. Indeed, hardly anyone in Ukraine ever
talked about nuclear weapons in terms of deterrence. Ukraine's intense
contestation of the nuclear issue in mid-1993 was about the political,
not military, value of nuclear weapons. For Ukraine's president Leonid
Kravchuk and the country's diplomats, nuclear ownership simply meant
entitlement to a fair compensation, both in terms of reimbursement for
fissile material contained in warheads and in terms of security
guarantees by United States and Russia. A faction in the Ukrainian
parliament took a more assertive stance and attempted to delay
denuclearization. Yet even they viewed Ukraine's nuclear inheritance not
in military terms but rather as a political hedge: The continued
presence of nuclear arms in Ukraine meant the West would continue to pay
attention and mitigate a potential conflict with Russia. The only
outspoken Ukrainian advocate for a nuclear deterrent, was Gen.-Maj.
Volodymyr Tolubko, a parliamentarian and former commander of a strategic
missile division. He openly stated, according to archival sources, that
Ukraine's unilateral renunciation was "romantic and premature" and that
the country should keep the SS-24s, which would be sufficient to "deter
any aggressor." Tolubko, however, was less specific on the subject of
deterrence and on occasion referred to a joint Ukrainian-Russian
operation of nuclear forces in Ukraine, a position the rest of the
leadership found untenable. Why was deterrence thinking so conspicuously
marginal in Ukraine? [As our paper
describes](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/interpreting-the-bomb-ownership-and-deterrence-ukraines-nuclear-discourse),
[Ukraine's political leadership had little experience with the
intricacies of nuclear strategy]{.underline}. Soviet defense
intellectuals who could educate them remained in Moscow[. Ukraine's own
military, Tolubko notwithstanding, was preoccupied with multiple
challenges associated with forging conventional national armed forces
out of the large number of underpaid Soviet troops left in
Ukraine.]{.underline} Ukraine's powerful missile lobby focused on
keeping productions lines busy, rather on nuclear deterrence. When it
saw that chances of retaining the 46 SS-24 ICBMs in Ukraine were
dwindling, it threw its weight behind joining the NPT and the [Missile
Technology Control Regime](http://mtcr.info/) that would allow Ukraine
to enter international civilian space markets. Finally, Kravchuk often
came off as personally antipathetic toward all things nuclear. His rare
comments on the military utility of nuclear weapons betray that he
couldn't help but imagine them in war-fighting terms and, as the
commander-in-chief who would be responsible for giving a launch order,
immediately balked at such a proposition. That is, Kravchuk doubted his
own credibility in carrying out a deterrent threat --- he struggled to
think the unthinkable. This attitude was, it seems, more sincere than
naïve. This reminds us that nuclear deterrence, as a set of concepts and
practices, does not come automatically attached to nuclear weaponry. In
fact, actors may struggle to grasp the military utility of nuclear
weapons. This should alert Western analysts to be more attentive to the
ways others conceive of nuclear capability. By projecting Western
concepts and modes of thinking where they might not belong, we risk
misreading our interlocutors' meanings and motivations, making
diplomatic solutions that much more difficult. Ukraine's
denuclearization deal was forged in a relatively short time and at a
rather low cost for the West. For Ukraine, the deal legitimized its
claims to the Soviet nuclear inheritance as well as recognized its
security concerns. Despite all the ingredients conducive to
proliferation, Ukraine emerged as a great nonproliferation success story
just at the time the NPT was going into its 1995 Review and Extension
conference. Today, Ukrainians are not so sure they did the right thing.
Following Russia's annexation of Crimea and involvement in the war in
Ukraine's east, in violation of its security commitments pledged to
Ukraine exchange for denuclearization, public support for the renewal of
Ukraine's nuclear status [rose to almost 50
percent](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/10/7/7040018/) from the
previous high of 33 percent in 1994. The final lesson of Ukraine's
denuclearization might be that future such deals will come at a much
higher cost and will require more robust security commitments on the
part of nuclear states.

#### Chinese-Ukraine trade, Ukraine distrust of the west, and investment in public infrastructure prove relations are strong now

Brimming with confidence after a landslide election victory, [[Ukraine's
President Volodymyr
Zelensky](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3011006/comedian-volodymyr-zelensky-takes-office-ukraines-president-uses)
may look to China to help keep his country's moribund economy
afloat]{.underline}. With a GDP per capita of US\$2,963 per year as of
2018 -- lower than Iraq and Venezuela -- Ukraine remains one of the
poorest countries in Europe and is desperate for any trade and
investment it can get. **[China will surpass Russia by 2020 as Ukraine's
largest single trading partner]{.underline}**. [In 2018, bilateral trade
between Beijing and Kiev reached US\$9.8 billion, a staggering increase
since 2014 -- and more than double the value of trade between Ukraine
and the United States.]{.underline} "Ukraine cannot ignore the economic
realities of the 21st century," said Professor Tetyana Valerievna of the
Kharkiv School of Economics. "While we may be on a westward trajectory
politically, we cannot ignore the fact that [**China will be our most
important** \[trade\] **partner**]{.underline}."And unlike agreements
with Western countries and organisations such as the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), [Beijing insists its investments and loans don't
come with other strings attached]{.underline}. Ukrainian businessman
Igor Kolomoisky -- the powerful oligarch whose television channel
broadcast the show that starred Zelensky before he became president --
is demanding the West write off billions of debt. "This is your game,
your geopolitics. You don't care about us, you want to harm Russia --
Ukraine is just a tool," Kolomoisky said at a recent press conference.
[After nearly three decades of Western-style capitalism with lacklustre
results, many Ukrainian economists are now looking to China's tremendous
rise for inspiration. Ukraine was among the first countries to publicly
announce support for [China's Belt and Road
Initiative](https://www.scmp.com/topics/belt-and-road-initiative)]{.underline}
back in 2013, according to Chinese state media. "How can emerging
economies develop? Simply put, we should replace the Washington
consensus with the Beijing consensus, which would help us shed the
status of 'Eastern Europe's Somalia' and become 'Eastern Europe's
Iceland'," Ukrainian economist Alexey Kushch said. "[The state should
mitigate failures and carry out rapid structural reforms, strengthening
the role of hi-tech industries based on established sectors of the
economy]{.underline}." Unlike the mood in the United States, there is
little anti-Chinese sentiment in Ukraine when it comes to business.
[Beijing has recently made a sustained effort to woo the Ukrainian
public with a series of high-profile gifts including 50 new ambulances,
50 emergency rescue vehicles, and a US\$137 million for cutting-edge
medical equipment for struggling hospitals]{.underline}. [Kiev has also
accepted US\$340 million in Chinese loans for a new bridge across the
Dnieper River while a Chinese state-run bank has pumped around US\$2
billion into a new metro project]{.underline}. In 2018 after meeting
Chinese officials, Ukraine's Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said:
"[**China is a strategic partner for Kiev**. We're ready to deepen the
cooperation"]{.underline}. The rapidly developing bilateral relationship
between Ukraine and China has drawn ire from Washington, Kiev's most
powerful ally in its ongoing military struggle against Russia. Fighting
in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian rebels and Ukraine forces has
claimed almost 13,000 lives. Speaking to the Kyiv Post, a Pentagon
official warned that "China's investments could be a double-edged
sword". The United States is currently locked in a bitter trade war with
China - and Beijing is one of Moscow's top allies. "[One way or another,
Ukraine will have to choose. They cannot eternally integrate with China
while moving toward the west]{.underline}," one Western diplomat
told The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity. Western
institutions such as the IMF have kept Ukraine's government afloat amid
an ongoing military conflict with Russia-backed forces and the loss of
highly productive industrial territories in the country's east.
[However, Kiev's history with IMF assistance packages has been rocky at
best -- out of the six programmes Ukraine has participated in since
independence, only one was fully completed -- the cooperation during
1994-1995 that helped Ukraine transition from a Soviet command-economy
into a free market.]{.underline} It is unclear how Zelensky, a
television comedian turned populist firebrand, will actually proceed
with IMF loans in the future because he has dissolved the legislature
and called for extraordinary snap elections in July. In his TV
show Servant of the People, Zelensky's character President Goloborodko
harshly criticised the institution, leading some to speculate that the
real president could be harbouring the same thoughts. However, his
administration has been diplomatic so far addressing the issue.
High-ranking presidential official Oleksandr Danylyuk said: "We agreed
we will actively cooperate with the IMF and other international
institutions to prepare for this summer period, during the election, a
relatively new programme that will give an additional impetus to our
country's economy." Zelensky's long-time business partner offered a
different view: "In my opinion, we should treat our creditors the way
Greece does," Kolomoisky told The Financial Times. Greece was the first
country to refuse to pay an IMF loan under austerity policies. In a
country divided by blurry social, cultural, religious, and linguistic
lines, one thing was made clear -- economic survival supersedes all
other concerns. At the ballot box, Ukrainians overwhelmingly rejected
President Petro Poroshenko's unrelenting push westward. A May 2019
survey by the Kiev-based "Rating" opinion research group revealed that
just 8.8 per cent of voters support the pro-Western European Solidarity
party -- even less than the 10.5 per cent who support the pro-Russia
Opposition Platform For Life party. [Ukraine's prime minister proclaimed
2019 to be the "year of China" in Ukraine]{.underline}. Judging by
Beijing's growing economic interest in the fledgling democracy, he just
might be right.

### China-Russia Cooperation Thumps

#### China-Russia cooperation is at an all-time high

Zachary **Cohen, 6-8**-2019, \"\'Unprecedented level\' of China-Russia
cooperation threatens US dominance,\" CNN,
<https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/08/politics/russia-china-partnership/index.html>

Washington (CNN[) The Pentagon is making it clear that Russia is to
blame after [two warships nearly
collided](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/politics/us-russia-navy-near-collision-intl/index.html) in
the Pacific on Friday, but while the incident was another tense military
encounter involving the two countries, the fact that it took place in
China\'s backyard is raising concerns about growing cooperation between
Moscow and Beijing to challenge US\'s position as the preeminent global
power]{.underline}. Russia and China have each sought to expand their
global reach by challenging American military dominance in the air and
at sea. But while both countries have been getting bolder, evidence
suggests they have done so independently. As near-peer rivals to the US,
both **[Russia and China are often aligned in many of their geopolitical
views]{.underline}** but Friday\'s incident was unusual because of where
it took place. While the US and Russia have offered different accounts
of Friday\'s incident, all indications suggest it took place in waters
off the coast of China. That is uncommon, according to Carl Schuster, a
retired US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US
Pacific Command\'s Joint Intelligence Center. \"[The Russians normally
harass our ships when they are operating in waters the Russian consider
to be within their sphere of Influence (Black Sea, Barents Sea and the
waters off Vladivostok)]{.underline},\" said Schuster, who spent 12
years at sea on US warships. [Friday\'s encounter took place two days
later Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir
Putin [met at the
Kremlin](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/asia/putin-xi-us-trade-intl/index.html) as
**the two countries are claiming relations are at their \"best level in
history.\"**]{.underline} \"It seems as if they\'re working in concert
with the Chinese. They\'re looking at the kinds of things that they can,
that they can do in concert with the Chinese to challenge the US. And if
it means helping the Chinese out in the Pacific, they will do so,\"
according to retired Air Force Col. and CNN military analyst Cedric
Leighton. \"[By the same token, they expect the Chinese to help them out
in other areas, perhaps in central Asia. So that\'s where we can see
other flashpoints between the US and, on the one hand, and Russia and
China on the other]{.underline},\" he said[. In addition to asserting
that Russia\'s relationship with China has reached an \"unprecedented
level,\" Putin highlighted their shared views on many geopolitical
issues, noting the two countries see eye to eye on several geopolitical
challenges, including tensions on the Korean Peninsula, in Venezuela and
the conflict in Syria.]{.underline} Xi called the Russian President \"a
friend,\" and reiterated Putin\'s view, saying that \"our cooperation is
based on mutual trust.\" Since 2013, the two leaders have met almost 30
times, according to Chinese state media[. Their last bilateral was at
the second Belt and Road Summit held in Beijing in April. While China
and Russia maintain strong ties when it comes to trade, both sides have
recently indicated they may be open to working together toward achieving
another shared strategic goal \-- pushing back against US
influence.]{.underline} [Russia has consistently demonstrated a
willingness to push the boundaries of international law when it comes to
asserting more control over the Baltic Sea and testing US commitments to
regional allies like Ukraine, particularly since its annexation of
Crimea in 2014.]{.underline} Last year, Russia [captured 24 Ukrainian
sailors ](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/25/europe/ukraine-sailors-russia-kerch-strait/index.html)after
aggressively ramming their ship in the Kerch Strait. Those sailors
remain in custody despite repeated calls by the US for their release.
There are also recent indications that Moscow is intent on growing its
influence globally \-- a push that will likely only escalate tensions
with the US. As part of that effort[, Russia has been expanding its
presence in the Pacific region amid growing tensions in the disputed
South China Sea \-- an issue that is particularly important to
China.]{.underline} Beijing claims almost the entire 1.3 million square
mile region as its sovereign territory and aggressively asserts its
stake, with Xi saying it will never give up \"any inch of territory.\"
But China is just one of several countries who lay claim to parts of the
South China Sea along with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and
Brunei. US military officials, meanwhile, have vowed to continue
enforcing a free and open Indo-Pacific. Acting Secretary of Defense
Patrick Shanahan said last month that [the Indo-Pacific region was the
US\'s most important theater from a security perspective. While he did
not mention China by name last month during a speech in Singapore, he
levied thinly failed criticism toward Beijing for using what he called a
\"toolkit of coercion]{.underline}.\" That toolkit included
island-building, deploying advanced weapons systems to disputed areas,
engaging in predatory economics and the alleged state-sponsored theft of
military and civilian technology \-- all activities the US has
previously accused China of undertaking. While the US and China have
sparred over the South China Sea for years, Russia has been
strengthening ties with countries in the region. [Though Russian
warships have become an increasingly common sight in the Indo-Pacific
region, they have typically avoided serious confrontations with US
forces when operating far from home, making the nature of Friday\'s
incident somewhat out of character for a country that has typically
prioritized coastal defense.]{.underline} By overtly challenging a US
ship in the Philippine Sea, [Putin may have been signaling to Xi that he
is ready to take their relationship to the next level]{.underline},
according to retired rear admiral and CNN military analyst John Kirby.
\"Clearly this sends a strong message to President Xi, from Putin\'s
perspective, that we are on your team,\" Kirby told CNN\'s Jim Sciutto.
\"[We have seen the Russians and Chinese cooperate
increasingly]{.underline} \... when it suits their interests,\" he said,
adding that the two countries participated in a major military exercise
together just last year. Top US military officials were quick to condemn
the Russian sailors for behavior they characterized as reckless and
irresponsible \-- a forceful response indicating the incident posed a
serious risk to the safety of American sailors. However it remains to be
seen what additional steps the US government will take in response to
the incident and whether this type of encounter indicates a broader
shift in Russia\'s relationship with China. What does seem clear,
however, is that Russia is continuing to ramp up its aggressiveness when
it comes to confronting US military forces. \"Putin clearly has ordered
the Russian Navy to pressure the USN whenever opportunities exist. It
may possibly be a show of political support for China while Xi is in
Moscow, but more likely to signal that Russia is willing to challenge
the US dominance on the world stage and at sea,\" Schuster said. \"You
saw actions in Syria, you saw actions in the eastern Mediterranean, in
the Baltic, in the Black Sea, and now in the Pacific. You\'re seeing
them really challenging the United states wherever they can so that they
can actually not only assert their dominance in a particular region, but
also kind of pave the way to judge and gauge our intentions and more
importantly our responses,\" Leighton added.

[China's President Xi Jinping recently visited Russia to attend the St.
Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), a Russian economic
forum that hosts various important global economic players, [to
discuss](https://forumspb.com/en/about/?lang=en) "the key economic
issues facing Russia, emerging markets and the world as a
whole."]{.underline} He was also there to celebrate the seventieth
anniversary of the two countries' bilateral ties by holding talks with
Russian president Vladimir Putin. Although it was Xi's first trip to
Russia in 2019, the visit to Russia came at a time of tensions between
China and the United States on multiple fronts. These include tensions
over trade, technology, and freedom of navigation operations in the
South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. And, due to its tensions with
Russia on some regional and strategic stability issues, the current U.S.
administration has called both China and Russia "revisionist powers"
that seek to challenge the preponderance of the United States. This
comes at a time when China and Russia
are [closer](https://www.ifri.org/en/publications/notes-de-lifri/russieneivisions/chutzpah-and-realism-vladimir-putin-and-making-russian) to
each other "than any time in the history of their relationship."
Although it is not the determinant factor, the current U.S. posture
towards both China and Russia could contribute to their rapidly growing
partnership. [Since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and the West
imposed sanctions, China has not expressed any
concerns [publicly](https://carnegietsinghua.org/2015/04/01/explaining-china-s-position-on-crimea-referendum-pub-59600) on
the annexation of Crimea. Instead, it has improved its relations with
Moscow on multiple fronts. Today, China is Russia's largest trading
partner, with a
trade [volume](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-01/10/c_137734116.htm) that
exceeded \$100 billion in 2018. Concerns over the two countries'
blossoming relationship has led some experts to raise the prospect that
both countries will "[join
forces](http://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/china-and-russia-join-forces/)."]{.underline}
[Both countries described their ties as]{.underline} **[a
"[Comprehensive Strategic Collaboration
Partnership](http://opinion.cntv.cn/2014/02/07/ARTI1391781363647600.shtml.),"
as military-to-military cooperation between the two countries is all

Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow
Center [described](https://carnegie.ru/2019/06/05/russia-china-are-key-and-close-partners-pub-79262) the
new Sino-Russian partnership as a "new model for 'major country
relationship.'" This growing relationship raises a concern in Washington
that the two countries could end up as a major "strategic challenge"
that has "profoundly negative consequences" to the United
States. [Scholars](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-and-russia-strategic-alliance-making-38727) and
commentators have already called the potential for this growing
partnership "[America's
nightmare](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/america%E2%80%99s-nightmare-sino-russian-entente-41447)."

### No Civil War

#### No civil war---political parties aren't willing to disavow public opinion

[Imagine a political party commands the absolute loyalty of 40 percent
of the American population. The leaders of this party use bare-knuckle
tactics to pass bills that appall the majority of Americans. Despite
public anger, its legislators cling to power by exploiting
anti-majoritarian elements of the political process.]{.underline} Adding
insult to injury, they justify their actions with a doctrine of minority
rule. The scenario described above actually happened, but not in the
present or recent past. In fact, it's taken from the 1850s. [There is a
lot of unhappiness with the state of American politics today.
Progressives decry "veto points" in the Constitution. President Trump
rages against the "deep state." Commentators fret about negative
polarization as the organizing principle for elections. Yet the idea
that this is going to lead to a second civil war, as some of the more
feverish voices have alleged, should be dismissed out of
hand.]{.underline} **[A dysfunctional government is not the same thing
as a destructive government]{.underline}**. Those who wish to see the
difference should read Northern Men With Southern Loyalties: The
Democratic Party and the Sectional Crisis by historian Michael Todd
Landis. His fantastic book is a sobering story about what politicians
will do to obtain and keep power, consequences be damned. [By 1850,
Southern Democrats held power disproportionate to their numbers in
Congress thanks to anti-majoritarian elements in American
politics]{.underline}. Among them were the Constitution's three-fifths
clause, which inflated the representation and electoral vote totals of
slave states; the equal number of slave states and free states, which
turned the Senate into a legislative chokepoint; and the election of
U.S. senators by state legislatures, making incumbents hard to dislodge.
Southerners used these "veto points" to kill anti-slavery bills[. In the
late 1840s, legislation that barred bondage from lands captured in the
Mexican War, the so-called Wilmot Proviso, repeatedly passed the House
of Representatives only to die in the Senate. After 1850, Democrats used
these checks on majority rule to override public opinion and pass
pro-slavery legislation]{.underline}. Landis justly accuses many
Northern Democrats of being "knowing collaborators in the Slave Power
agenda of slavery expansion and Southern supremacy." Faced with the
choice between career advancement in a political party with
disproportionately Southern leadership and obeying their constituents,
many Northern Democrats chose the former. Their votes secured the
passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act of
1854, and a pro-slavery state constitution for Kansas in 1858. [Leading
Northern Democrats were accomplished politicians. Jesse Bright had such
a tight grip on his Senate seat that contemporaries called him the
"autocrat" of Indiana. Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan managed to win
reelection despite defying the instructions of his state legislature to
vote for the Wilmot Provison.]{.underline} James Buchanan of
Pennsylvania held major foreign policy posts prior to becoming president
in 1856. [Alongside such (in)famous men were obscure congressmen who
played outsized roles in the political dramas of the age]{.underline}.
For example, William Richardson of Illinois worked with Alexander
Stephens, the future vice president of the Confederacy, to push the
Kansas-Nebraska Act through the House of Representatives in the spring
of 1854. [Northern voters did express their displeasure with their
representatives]{.underline}. In the 1854 elections, the Democratic
Party lost 21 of 22 Northern districts where Democrats voted to allow
slavery into Kansas. But in the face of rising anti-slavery sentiment in
the North, Southern Democrats and Northern "doughfaces" did not
reevaluate their strategy. [They demanded greater fidelity to party
orthodoxies on slavery, and denounced dissenters as fanatics and
traitors]{.underline}. Two years after the Kansas-Nebraska debacle,
James Buchanan, who so often talked up his "long, consistent strong
support of Southern rights," won the presidency. Southern rights meant
protecting slavery at all costs. In 1857, a proposed state constitution
for the territory of Kansas arrived in Congress. The document was the
handiwork of a constitutional convention called by an illegitimate
territorial legislature (it had been elected by pro-slavery settlers,
who constituted 10 percent of the population, and Missouri "border
ruffians," who stuffed ballot boxes). Yet Southern Democrats turned the
admission of Kansas as a slave state into a test of party loyalty.
Buchanan overcame fierce resistance with threats of purges and promises
of bribes. Thomas Harris of Illinois remarked that Buchanan had "bought
men like hogs in the market." White House agent Cornelius Wendell was
blunter: "The object was accomplished, and the money was paid." While
Buchanan was doling out bribes, some pro-administration Democrats
attempted to explain themselves. Senator William Bigler of Pennsylvania
opted for expediency: the need to end the violence in Kansas, he said,
meant Congress had no choice except to approve a fraudulent state
constitution. Jesse Bright was more direct. Speaking on the floor of the
Senate in March 1858, he articulated an [anti-democratic philosophy of
minority rule: The representative opinion may be in conflict with the
popular voice; an overwhelming majority may raise an indignant protest
against the expressed legislative will; yet it stands as the controlling
law until set aside in accordance with legal forms. He who supposes that
the opinions of a majority, even when clearly expressed, necessarily
make the laws, has mistaken the whole theory of our
Government]{.underline}. That majority, before it can make itself
effectual, must fix upon its representative and clothe him with the
authority to speak in its behalf at the proper time and place. He was no
less blunt in condemning the fitness of voters: "So strong...is my
conviction of the viciousness of the principle of submitting to a direct
vote of the people the propriety of the enactment or rejection of laws,
that for one I am prepared to extend the same objection to the
submission of entire constitution to the same tribunal." For the record,
the Senate expelled Bright in 1862. The charge was treason**[. The
United States is nowhere near fighting a second civil war for the simple
reason that neither political party has shown a willingness, let alone
an ability, to repeatedly defy public opinion on divisive
issues]{.underline}**. [The antebellum Democratic Party muscled through
laws protecting slavery through Congress, and many Northern Democrats
openly disregarded their constituents' wishes in the process. For all of
President Trump's braggadocio, the Republican Party's achievements
amount merely to tax reform and appointments to the federal judiciary.
Anyone howling about about minority rule and a second civil war needs to
ponder that gap.]{.underline}

#### American political violence is not high enough to spark a civil war

Ilya **Somin**, 10-1-**2018**, \"No, We\'re Not on the Brink of Civil
War. But the Reasons Why We\'re Not Are Far From Entirely Reassuring.,\"
Reason,
https://reason.com/2018/10/01/no-were-not-on-the-brink-of-civil-war-bu/

[The deeply polarized and highly partisan tone of recent politics has
led [some
pundits](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/1/17401384/civil-war-weimar-larping-punditry-analogies-disaster-porn) to [fear
that we may be on the brink of another civil
war](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/19/are-we-on-the-verge-of-civil-war/).
In reality, any such conflict is highly unlikely]{.underline}. But the
reasons why are far from fully reassuring. Political scientist Morris
Fiorina, a leading expert on American public opinion, has an excellent
article explaining why **[the \"brink of civil war\" meme is greatly
exaggerated]{.underline}**: Recent
articles [here](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/origins-of-second-civil-war-globalism-tech-boom-immigration-campus-radicalism/) and [here](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/sep/19/are-we-on-the-verge-of-civil-war/) by
Victor Davis Hanson---my colleague at the Hoover Institution--paint a
frightening picture of the United States as a country teetering on the
edge of civil war..... I am happy to report that the available data
provide grounds for feeling much more sanguine about the state of our
country. [Although they are noisy and harmful to our politics, the kinds
of people Hanson criticizes are many fewer in number than generally
believed. They are what political scientists call the political class, a
small minority of self-appointed activists, demonstrators, donors,
partisan media commentators and office-seekers]{.underline}. Given that
such people are the public face of politics, many Americans
understandably take them as representative, but they are statistically
abnormal---what we call \"outliers.\" [To understand contemporary
American political life, you should begin with the realization that most
of the people blabbering on cable television, venting on Facebook,
and/or fulminating on Twitter are abnormal]{.underline}. They are
abnormally interested and involved in politics, they tend to occupy the
policy extremes, and they are abnormally opinionated... Consider some
numbers. As of today, there are about 235 million eligible voters in the
United States. About one percent of them subscribe to either The New
York Times or The Wall Street Journal. Liberals rail against Fox News
and conservatives against MSNBC; they should take consolation in the
fact that the Fox viewing audience is about one percent of the eligible
electorate while news shows on MSNBC fall short of that. Sean Hannity\'s
is the highest-rated political show on cable television with an audience
of about 1.5 percent of the eligible electorate. On the other end of the
spectrum Rachel Maddow gets a bit over one percent. Anderson Cooper 360
draws in a paltry 0.4 of one percent. Granted, these small audiences may
spread the word to some non-subscribers and non-viewers, but even taking
such second-order effects into account, the simple fact is that the
ranks of the politically interested are surprisingly thin. Fiorina goes
on to point out (correctly) that [most Americans do not align with the
ideological extremes of either party, and that the self-described
distribution of liberals, moderates, and conservatives has changed very
little over the last few decades]{.underline}. He is also right to
emphasize that the kinds of people who avidly follow political news (and
the kinds who tend to read blog posts like this one!) are highly
unrepresentative. Fiorina could have added that [the actual rate of
domestic **political violence in America today is still much lower than
that of the 1960s**, when both far-right and far-left groups engaged in
it on a far larger scale than anything we have seen in recent years. Yet
we did not come close to civil war back then, either.]{.underline} The
reasons for optimism about a potential civil war are far from reassuring
when it comes to their implications for other aspects of American
politics, however. As Fiorina emphasizes, [the biggest factor tamping
down war fever is that most Americans simply aren\'t that interested in
politics, and don\'t follow it closely]{.underline}. This [is actually
rational behavior for most
voters](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2013/10/11/ilya-somin/democracy-political-ignorance):
if your only reason to keep track of government and public policy is to
be a better voter, that\'s not much of an incentive to do so, since the
chance your vote will make a different to the outcome of an election is
extremely small. [Widespread political ignorance of this kind reduces
the quality of government policy, and renders voters vulnerable to
deception and demagoguery, of the sort that we often see on
both [right](https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/opinions/political-ignorance-somin/index.html) and [left](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/12/12/jonathan-gruber-was-right-about-political-ignorance/?utm_term=.d18626760e25).
The dangers of this kind of ignorance are [exacerbated by the enormous
size, scope, and complexity of modern
government](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2013/10/11/ilya-somin/democracy-political-ignorance),
which make it difficult for rationally ignorant voters to effectively
monitor more than a small fraction of its activities.]{.underline} The
small minority of activists that Fiorina refers to are generally much
better-informed than the average voter. But they also tend to be highly
biased in their evaluation of political information. [Instead of acting
as truth-seekers, most behave as loyal [\"political
fans\"](http://www.volokh.com/posts/1222317278.shtml) of Team Red or
Team Blue, overvaluing anything that supports their preexisting views,
and discounting anything that cuts against them]{.underline}. This kind
of bias [has been on full display in recent
days](https://reason.com/volokh/2018/09/25/partisan-bias-motivated-reasoning-and-th),
when commentators\' opinions on the veracity of the sexual assault
accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has
been [closely correlated with their general political
alignment](https://www.city-journal.org/farce-and-tragedy-in-kavanaugh-confirmation-process-16201.html).
Such \"motivated reasoning\" is particularly common in an era when (as
Fiorina recognizes) [the two parties are more polarized than in the
past, and partisan hatred is unusually
high](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/12/16/the-perils-of-partisan-bias/?utm_term=.340ec095711b).
**[Biased activists/political fans are unlikely to cause a new civil
war]{.underline}**. But they do wield political influence
disproportionate to their numbers. That further reduces both the quality
of political discourse, and the quality of the policies advocated by
both major parties. We should be happy that a second Civil War is
unlikely to break out anytime soon. But there is much less cause for
celebration when it comes to the overall state of American democracy.

#### No civil war---American military superiority prevents internal implosion

Ian **Morris**, 11-7-**2018**, \"America\'s Coming Disunion?,\"
Stratfor,
<https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/americas-coming-disunion> JEJP

Is the United States on the brink of a new civil war? According to
Newsweek magazine\'s polling, one-third of all Americans think such a
conflict could break out within the next five years, with 10 percent
thinking it \"very likely to happen.\" Plenty of experts agree. Back in
March, State Department official Keith Mines told Foreign Policy
magazine, \"It is like 1859, everyone is mad about something and
everyone has a gun.\" He rated the odds of a second American Civil War
breaking out within the next 10-15 years at 60 percent. October\'s awful
events --- pipe bombs sent to leading Democratic politicians and
supporters, the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh --- have only
amplified these fears. \"We are now nearing a point comparable to
1860,\" my Stanford University colleague Victor Davis Hanson recently
wrote in the National Review. The historian Niall Ferguson, another
Stanford colleague, suggested in The Sunday Times of London that if
someone were to design a \"Civil War Clock\" comparable to the Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists\' \"Doomsday Clock,\" the designer would
probably now be announcing that it is \"two minutes to Fort Sumter.\"
[Ferguson himself is more upbeat, thinking that \"the time on the civil
war Doomsday Clock looks more like 11.08 than 11.58.\" It seems to me,
though, that all these speculations are deeply misleading --- so much
so, in fact, that the main thing they illustrate is how not to use the
past to understand the present.]{.underline} [There are certainly some
striking similarities between the American political scene in the late
2010s and that of the late 1850s]{.underline}. [Both periods saw extreme
polarization over issues of intense economic and emotional
importance]{.underline}. At both times, the country divided
geographically, with more urban and educated regions leaning one way and
more rural and less educated regions the other. In both periods, highly
partisan media inflamed passions, sometimes brazenly peddling \"fake
news\"; and at both stages, the country was recovering from a severe
financial crisis. It is all very alarming --- but that does not put us
minutes away from Fort Sumter. [In the nearly four years that I have
been writing columns for Stratfor, I have repeatedly drawn attention to
a distinction that logicians like to make between [\"formal\" and
\"relational\"
analogies](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/learning-lessons-long-term-history).
A formal analogy involves finding similarities between a case about
which we know a lot (such as what happened in the United States at the
end of the 1850s) and one about which we know less (such as what is just
beginning to happen in the United States at the end of the 2010s), and
extrapolating from them to variables that cannot be observed in the less
well-known case --- concluding, here, that if polarization,
sectionalism, financial problems and political violence produced civil
war in the 1850s, they will have the same result in the
2010s.]{.underline} The problem with formal analogies is, of course,
that no two cases are identical. [The modern rage over globalization and
its discontents does not come close to the moral intensity of the
19th-century arguments over slavery, while the consequences of the 1857
financial meltdown were nowhere near those of the 2008
collapse]{.underline}. Even more striking, the forms of political
violence in the two periods are very different. The 1850s experienced
nothing like last month\'s pipe bombs, the 2017 shooting of Republican
Rep. Steve Scalise and three others or the 2011 shooting of Democratic
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others; and the 2010s have seen nothing
like U.S. Rep. Preston Brooks\' near-fatal 1856 attack on Sen. Charles
Sumner on the floor of the U.S. Senate, let alone the \"Bleeding
Kansas\" insurrection of 1855-56 or John Brown\'s raid on the federal
armory at Harper\'s Ferry in 1859. The devil is in the details, which
means that differences are just as important as similarities when we try
to learn from the past. But how do we weigh up the pros and cons of
comparisons? This is where the second kind of analogy comes in. [Rather
than cherry-picking convenient similarities and either ignoring or
arguing away inconvenient differences, relational analogies begin from
broad patterns in multiple well-known cases and proceed by understanding
how a less well-known case fits into the larger structure]{.underline}.
So, rather than wringing our hands over how much 2018 resembles 1860, we
should be looking at how civil wars began in a wide range of different
contexts, and then asking how well the late 2010s fit into that pattern.
The most obvious point is that the polarization/regionalism/financial
crisis/political violence package is not just shared by 1850s and 2010s
America. It was also common in many other eras that ended in civil war.
The English Civil War of 1642-51, for instance, was preceded by decades
of comparable disturbances. The population split into \"court\" and
\"country\" factions (nowadays more familiar as \"Cavaliers\" and
\"Roundheads\"). Each had its own geographical base and religious
affiliation, with High Church Royalists and Puritan Roundheads literally
ready to mutilate and burn each other over their differences. Distrust
of institutions was even worse than in 2010s America: Royalists accused
Parliamentarians of blasphemy and corruption, while Parliamentarians
replied that Royalist corruption was even worse, and was magnified by
the royal court\'s sexual deviance and willingness to sell the country
to foreigners. Throughout the 1630s, financial crises paralyzed
government and political violence mounted. Pro-Parliament mobs murdered
bishops and besieged royal favorites in their mansions, and, in the
17th-century equivalent of sending anthrax spores through the mail, a
leading Parliamentarian received a package containing a rag soaked in
pus from the sores of a plague victim. He suffered no ill effects ---
then as now, biological terrorism was difficult to do well --- but
within a year, the two sides would fight their first pitched battle.
[Differences are just as important as similarities when we try to learn
from the past]{.underline}. The Roman Republic provides another classic
case. In the 50s B.C., the political elite was deeply divided between
what Romans called populares --- men such as Julius Caesar, who
presented themselves as champions of the masses --- and optimates such
as Pompey the Great, who claimed to stand for virtue, tradition and the
nation as a whole. Webs of patronage and debt bound much of the
population to one faction or the other. Escalating financial crises
ruined cities and regions, and entire provinces lined up behind
strongmen who claimed to be able to save them --- Gaul with Caesar,
Italy with Pompey. Politicians fortified their homes against mob
violence, street gangs regularly stopped elections from being held and
assassination became almost commonplace. The civil wars that began in 49
B.C. would leave millions dead. [However, although England and Rome
provide alarming formal analogies, things get more complicated as soon
as we start looking for relational analogies. While the
polarization/regionalism/financial crisis/political violence package
regularly leads to civil war, it does not always do so]{.underline}. In
Rome, for instance, the package was in some ways even more prominent in
the 130s B.C. than in Julius Caesar\'s day. Tiberius Gracchus, usually
seen as the first popularis politician, tried to cancel the debts of
poor farmers and redistribute elite properties to them. A constitutional
crisis ensued, splitting the ruling class. To conservatives, Gracchus
seemed to be rallying the impoverished peasants of Etruria against Roman
urban interests to make himself king. In political violence going far
beyond Brooks\' assault on Sumner, a meeting of the Roman Senate in 133
B.C. ended with conservatives breaking up the wooden benches on which
they sat and using the pieces to beat Gracchus and 300 of his followers
to death. Twelve years later, his brother Gaius also died in political
violence over much the same issues. Yet civil war did not erupt in
either case. Similarly, following Henry VIII\'s break with the Roman
church and dissolution of the Catholic monasteries in the 1530s, England
experienced just as much polarization, regionalism, financial crisis and
political violence as it would in the 1630s. However, it did not tip
into civil war, although it came close. **[The United States was
arguably almost as divided and haunted by political violence in the
1960s as in the 1850s, yet it too escaped civil war.]{.underline}** We
can only conclude that the polarization/regionalism/financial
crisis/political violence package was not a sufficient cause for civil
war in Rome, England or the United States. Nor was it a necessary cause.
In Rome and England at least, civil wars broke out in the absence of
polarization, regionalism or financial crisis (although political
violence is, by definition, always part of civil war). In A.D. 69, which
became known as \"The Year of the Four Emperors,\" multiple civil wars
convulsed Rome, but they were driven almost entirely by generals\'
ambitions to seize the throne. Similarly, between 1135 and 1153, England
was torn apart by such severe civil wars that the period came to be
called \"The Anarchy.\" The violence was so extreme, one chronicler
recorded, that \"Men said openly that Christ and his saints slept\"; yet
the polarization/regionalism/financial crisis/political violence package
was largely absent in the 1130s. A royal succession crisis and fragile
state institutions were all it took. The
polarization/regionalism/financial crisis/political violence package
that 2010s America shares with 1850s America can be present without
leading to civil war, and civil wars can break out without the package
being present. We can only conclude that these forces are neither a
necessary nor a sufficient condition for civil war. [The dark prophecies
of a second Civil War within the coming decade might well be nothing
more than bad scholarship]{.underline}. So, the obvious questions: Why
do the polarization/regionalism/financial crisis/political violence
package and civil war sometimes go together and sometimes not, and will
they go together in America\'s short-term future? Fortunately, the
answer to the first question was worked out long ago, by the Roman
historian Tacitus. Looking back on the Year of the Four Emperors some 50
years after the event, he recognized that \"Now was divulged the secret
of the empire --- that emperors could be made elsewhere than Rome.\"
What he meant by this was that although the empire\'s political
institutions were all concentrated in the city of Rome, if the armies
out in the provinces decided to intervene in the political process, they
always had the final say. Rome lurched into civil war in 49 B.C. because
Caesar and Pompey each had armies to back their political ambitions. It
did so again in A.D. 69 because no fewer than four rivals found
themselves in this position. It did not lurch into civil war in 133
B.C., though, because its mighty armies remained aloof from politics.
This is Thomas Hobbes\' central point in \'Leviathan\': [Only a powerful
government with terrifying armed force can scare people straight and
deter them from using violence to pursue their own ends]{.underline}.
[England stumbled into civil war in 1642 because it had no standing army
at all. When relations between the Royalists and Parliamentarians broke
down, each could safely set about raising its own armed forces with no
fear that Leviathan would intervene and stop them. This was Thomas
Hobbes\' central point in his 1651 masterpiece Leviathan; only a
powerful government with terrifying armed force can scare people
straight and deter them from using violence to pursue their own ends.
Things had been even worse in 1135, because in addition to there being
no strong central army, dozens of barons had their own private armies,
which they gleefully unleashed on rivals. In the 1530s, by contrast,
despite the mass uprising in defense of Catholicism known as the
Pilgrimage of Grace, the barons largely remained loyal to Henry VIII and
civil war was avoided. When relations between Northern and Southern
states broke down in 1861, the United States had more in common
militarily with England in 1642 than with any of the other cases
discussed here. It did have a professional army, but it contained just
16,367 men, and 179 of its 197 companies were stationed west of the
Mississippi, so far from the initial areas of fighting as to render them
irrelevant. In any case, one in five of the U.S. Army\'s officers
promptly resigned their commissions to join the Confederate states and
thousands of noncommissioned men simply deserted and followed them. The
government in Washington effectively had no army to enforce its will,
and both sides --- like King Charles I and the English Parliament in
1642 --- had to set about raising forces almost from
scratch]{.underline}. [Nothing could be less like the United States\'
position in 2018. It has the most powerful and professional armed forces
the world has ever seen, and there is absolutely no doubt about their
loyalty to the legitimate government or commitment to the principle of
civilian command. American soldiers, sailors and airmen do have
political opinions, but they currently can be relied on to put their
duty first.]{.underline} The United States therefore has far more in
common with Rome in 133 B.C. than with any of the other cases. [Even if
U.S. senators start killing each other with chair legs, the armed forces
will not take sides, other than to implement orders --- so long as the
orders are legitimate and legal --- from their elected
commander-in-chief]{.underline}. When we look at the recent civil wars
in Syria, Yemen and Libya, or at places such as Egypt where civil war
has been averted, nothing matters so much as the stance and strength of
the armed forces. We have to conclude that the American Civil War
Doomsday Clock does not stand at two, or even 52, minutes to midnight.
The very idea is ridiculous. So long as the armed forces remain true to
their highest traditions, it will not matter how angry the American
people get or how badly their politicians behave. There will be no
second Civil War.

## Solvency

### No Solvency -- Nuclear War Inevitable

#### Nuclear war is inevitable

**Crisp 18** (John, "The Inevitable Nuclear War"
<https://www.timesrecordnews.com/story/opinion/2018/02/12/inevitable-nuclear-war/329201002/>)
NIJ

**[We don't do enough thinking about catastrophe]{.underline}**, so
let's pause to note that **[everything]{.underline}** on our national
political stage --- tax reform, immigration, health care, the Mueller
investigation --- and in our private lives, for that matter, **[occurs
against two apocalyptic backdrops: climate change and nuclear
war.]{.underline}** That's too much to think about in 700 words, so
let's allow climate change to simmer on the back burner for a while.
[Despite already catastrophic effects, we're doing very little about
it]{.underline}, anyway; on the contrary, we've elected national
leadership that doesn't take it seriously. So [let's consider instead
the possibility of nuclear war]{.underline}: The 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis got our attention, and for a decade or two we lived with the
reality that nuclear destruction was as few as 30 minutes away. We built
fallout shelters, studied ways to protect ourselves from radiation and
held civil defense drills. Then we got used to the idea and settled into
a grim nuclear standoff with other nuclear nations; the notion of
nuclear annihilation became as abstract and distant --- and as easily
ignorable --- as climate change. We even made successful efforts at
limiting nuclear proliferation and at reducing standing nuclear
arsenals. But [with Iran, North Korea and a U.S. president more inclined
toward belligerence than diplomacy, things have changed: nuclear is
back. Current conditions are reminiscent of the world of 1913, just
prior to the start of the First World War: The Great War didn't have a
proximate cause, and historians still puzzle over why it happened at
all.]{.underline} How could such a cataclysmic world-wide event be
triggered by an isolated assassination in Sarajevo in 1914? [The answer
resides in the tensions and rivalries among the great international
powers of the day and in their response to them, which was to prepare
for war.]{.underline} For example, in 1900 Germany decided to build a
fleet to match Britain's Royal Navy, and by 1906 a full-fledged race for
battleship superiority was underway. Similarly, France extended the
terms of service of its conscripts in order to match the size of
Germany's growing army. In short, by 1913 armies and weapons had taken
on a life of their own that threatened the power of national leaders and
diplomats to control them. Because the European powers were so well
prepared for war, war had become almost inevitable. The assassination of
Archduke Ferdinand was merely the incidental trigger that ignited the
conflagration. Further, in 1913 war was a matter of horses and swords
and single-shot, bolt-action rifles. Certainly, soldiers got hurt and
many died, but Europe didn't have the collective imagination to envision
the devastation of a modern war fought with modern weapons. Few could
have predicted 40 million casualties in just four years. [We suffer from
both of these conditions today: We've never really absorbed the stark
lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and we've failed to extrapolate the
devastation of the two comparatively modest nuclear weapons discharged
in 1945 to a significant exchange of today's much more powerful weapons.
**Because the aftermath of a real nuclear war is unthinkable, we've
largely refused to think about it.**]{.underline} Further, **[the
weapons themselves threaten our capacity to control them.]{.underline}**
Nuclear weapons are precarious, as indicated by the recent panic in
Honolulu when a defense drill got out of hand. [And while we might hope
that the use of nuclear weapons could be constrained by rationality,
somehow in our country we've allowed the so-called nuclear football to
fall into the hands of a man who is characterized by emotion,
insecurity, impulse and bluster. And then there's Kim
Jong-un.]{.underline} One other factor works against us, just as it did
in 1913: Next year's Pentagon budget will be \$716 billion, the largest
ever. **[Weapons demand to be used. We've never invented a weapon that
we've declined to use. All of this implies that a nuclear war is
inevitable, and the ensuing calamity will be
unimaginable.]{.underline}** The only silver lining is that the
devastation of climate change will fade into insignificance.

#### Risk of nuclear war is incredibly high regardless of the affirmative.

the Odds?" *The Nonproliferation Review* 20, no. 2, p. 371-373) NIJ

Uncertainty Analysis Classical statistical analysis often provides
confidence intervals around estimated parameters. [Bayesian analysis
constructs credible intervals]{.underline}, using somewhat different
procedures and the interpretation is also different. For four different
probability parameters, this viewpoint started with a prior
distribution, utilized the available evidence, and derived a posterior
distribution. [I show below the means, the medians, and the 95 percent
credible intervals of these posterior distributions. The incurred risk
of nuclear war from significant military provocation during crises had a
mean of 14.3 percent]{.underline}, a median of 8.7 percent, and a 95
percent credible interval of 0.018 to 53.7 percent. [The expected risk
of nuclear war from significant military provocation during crises had a
mean of 13.4 percent]{.underline}, a median of 8.5 percent, and a
95-percent credible interval of 0.018 to 47.5 percent. [The incurred
mishap risk of nuclear war during forty-four years of Cold War had a
mean of 34.9 percent]{.underline}, a median of 32.5 percent, and a 95
percent credible interval of 3.5 to 78.3 percent. [The expected mishap
risk of nuclear war during forty-four years of Cold War had a mean of
44.1 percent]{.underline}, a median of 42.8 percent, and a 95-percent
credible interval of 5.0 to 88.7 percent. [The expected risk of a
general conventional war resulting in nuclear war during sixty-six years
of the nuclear age had a mean of 19.4 percent]{.underline}, a median of
13.1 percent, and a 95 percent credible interval of 0.035 to 66.6
percent. The estimated deterrent effect of nuclear weapons in preventing
general conventional wars has a mean of 64.8 percent, a median of 76.1
percent, and a 95 percent credible interval of 0.50 to 99.94 percent.
The above 95 percent credible intervals provide a fairly wide range of
possible probabilities. These wide ranges tell us that it may be
possible for further evidence or sound reasoning to alter the
conclusions. These ranges are not, however, a license to choose whatever
beliefs one wishes on these matters. For example, if the temperature
tomorrow is predicted to be 70F, with a 95 percent credible interval of
60F to 80F, we are not free to assume that the temperature will be
either 608F or 80F, depending on which temperature we like better.
Similarly, [unless additional evidence can be found to demonstrate a
different set of probabilities, the mean probability]{.underline} (not
the median or a range) [is the best probability estimate for the
evidence and models in this viewpoint.]{.underline} Another way to
analyze uncertainty about the probability estimates is to test the
sensitivity of the model to changes in assumptions. Various assumptions,
described in this viewpoint, were utilized to obtain the probability
estimates. If the assumptions and calculations are correct, the results
are correct. Suppose one or more assumptions might be incorrect\*how
would the model results change? The incurred risk of nuclear war was
44.3 percent from two pathways (crises and mishaps). Estimates from
these two pathways depend on seven basic factors that were applied to
the model. I varied each factor to be half or double their baseline
values. I then classified the results of these alternatives as
''optimistic'' or ''pessimistic,'' depending on whether they reduced or
increased the estimated probability of nuclear war. When all seven
factors are set to the optimistic variations, the probability estimate
becomes 7.3 percent. When all seven factors are set to the pessimistic
variations, the probability estimate becomes 91.2 percent. [**The
expected risk of nuclear war was 60.9 percent from three pathways
(crises, mishaps, and general conventional war).**]{.underline}
Estimates from these three pathways depend on ten basic factors that
were entered into to the model. When all ten factors are set to
optimistic variations, the probability estimate becomes 16.4 percent.
When all ten factors are set to pessimistic variations, the probability
estimate becomes 94.7 percent. Again, these ranges are not a license to
believe whatever one wishes on these matters. They are simply a spur for
further research to obtain more evidence, data, or analyses that could
refine these numbers. The pathways to accidental nuclear war can be
analyzed more carefully through engineering and process analyses, such
as is often applied to safety analyses of nuclear power plants and other
complex systems. Analyses of the pathways through conventional war or
international crises require further research in the behavioral and
social sciences. Future refinements of these estimates could just as
easily be more pessimistic as more optimistic. In the absence of such
further knowledge and sound reasons for arguing otherwise, there is no
reason to suppose these estimates of risk are grossly incorrect.
Fighting the Cold War with nuclear armaments and nuclear threats was a
perilous wager. **[The probability of a failure resulting in nuclear war
exceeded the probability of making an incorrect call while flipping a
coin.]{.underline}** The world must find a way to unwind this desperate
gamble. It is vital that all practical measures be considered and
effective measures taken to reduce or eliminate the continuing
unacceptable risk of nuclear war.

### No Solvency -- Ukraine-Russia War Inevitable

#### No solvency---Ukraine is only a board piece in the broader struggle between the West and Russia over security concerns in Europe---the War is inevitable

Jeremy **Shapiro**, 2-12-**2015**, \"An alternative to arming Ukraine,\"
Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/02/12/an-alternative-to-arming-ukraine/>
JEJP

Our central point is that [Ukraine is actually just one battleground in
a broader struggle between Russia and the West over the regional order
in Europe.]{.underline} The Western concept of the post-Cold War
security order in Europe was that stability and prosperity come from
non-negotiable acceptance of the rules of Western organizations like the
European Union (EU) and NATO. Such a concept could never integrate a
country like Russia, both because Russia's multiplicity of economic,
social, and security problems require more flexibility than that, and
because Russia's sense of its own greatness would never allow it. The
West's effort, since the end of the Cold War, to treat Russia as a
normal European country with no greater sovereign rights than, say,
Luxembourg or Latvia, infuriates the hyper-nationalist lurking within
most Russian leaders. The continued Western insistence on this view of
Russia, even [as Russia's power has risen in recent years, convinces its
leaders that the [West will not stop until Russia is reduced to a level
of subservience to the United States similar to that of other European
countries.](http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/23570#sel=16:23,17:34)]{.underline}
Russian leaders see U.S. involvement in Ukraine in precisely this light.
[[As Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev put it on
February 10](http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150210/1018051955.html) ,
"The U.S. has been trying to entangle Russia in an interstate military
conflict and to make use of the developments in Ukraine for regime
change and, ultimately, for splitting our country." This means that
there is little point in negotiating or even fighting over Ukraine
alone. Even if, by some miracle, [the ceasefire negotiated in
Minsk](http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/a-complex-of-measures-to-fulfill-the-minsk-agreements-380395.html)holds,
or the Russians were forced by provision of arms to accept Western
demands vis-à-vis Ukraine, conflict would break out again, in Ukraine or
elsewhere, as long as the core dispute over the regional order remained
unresolved]{.underline}. [Instead, in order to solve the problem, we
need to begin a negotiation on the question of the European security
order and Russia's role within it.]{.underline} Russia has been asking
for this negotiation since at least 1989, but the West has never really
taken that request seriously. We now need to enter into a negotiation to
revise the European security order on terms acceptable to Russia and the
West.

[The United States and Russia are locked in an angry geopolitical

conflict---even if neither country wants it. America's current strategy
toward Russia, simply put, is not working; instead, it's tying our

internally. The dangers are escalating. Diplomatic tools that prevented
armed conflict during the Cold War have atrophied; arms control and
verification regimes that helped provide strategic stability and prevent
a costly arms race are in danger of collapsing. The United States has
imposed dozens of sanctions on Russia that have had no apparent impact
on its foreign policy behavior. Official meetings and negotiating fora
have largely dried up, while citizen-to-citizen contacts have diminished
to the point where neither public understands the other. Meanwhile,
Russia has formed a de facto entente with China, our main global
competitor. Moscow is becoming bolder in challenging the United States
and its allies while expanding its regional and global trade and
security arrangements.]{.underline} To revise our strategy toward Russia
we must first define America's own long-term strategic interests. Our
paramount interest is national security. [Russia remains the only
country that can destroy the United States with nuclear weapons. Moscow
is developing a new generation of hypersonic weapons designed to evade
U.S. defenses and hit their targets with little or no
warning.]{.underline} It has the means to disrupt the American way of
life, even destroy our advanced weaponry, through cyber attacks against
U.S. computer networks. And, as we saw in 2016, it can exploit social
media to undermine our democracy with disinformation campaigns that
hearken back to the "active measures" of the Soviet period. [The United
States, of course, has the capability to harm Russia, which locks the

### No Solvency---Putin Approval Ratings

#### Putin's decline in popularity will spark a lashout---this was the basis for the annexation of Crimea

[A survey published on March 7 by the WCIOM agency said that **Putin's
trust rating slipped to 32 percent** to hit a new historic low since
2006]{.underline}, compared to 33.4 percent in January this year.
Importantly, the WCIOM is a state pollster while its poll was carried
out between February 25 and March 5, so after Putin's annual speech to
the Federal Assembly delivered on February 20. It could come as an
effort to bolster the president's public image denounced in 2018 as an
aftermath of two unpopular state decisions to hike the value-added tax
rate and increase the retirement age.[Initially, the speech had been set
to be held in March to mark the fifth anniversary of Moscow's annexation
of Crimea, Russian "Vedomosti" newspaper quoted a Kremlin source as
saying]{.underline}. The presidential administration decided, however,
to move the address to an earlier date in a bid to stop the fall of the
rating. As it later turned out, [the speech purposefully tackled social
and domestic issues, which might have hinted Kremlin officials not to
connect these matters with Crimea's annexation and Moscow's foreign
policy]{.underline}. Russian Dozhd TV channel reported [the Kremlin
sought to find positive topics to be included in the president's speech
because "people have grown weary of missiles]{.underline}", citing one
of its sources as saying. To make matters worse, Putin's speech did not
particularly attract popular attention, denoting the worst result since
2014, while [fewer and fewer Russians believe that a single decision of
the president, referred to as a "good tsar", will exert a positive
influence on their lives.Putin has in the past needed to grapple with
falling trust ratings while making attempts to regain popularity: back
in 2000, the president enjoyed high public support after Russia's
Chechen war, additionally backed by both state and private TV

turn translated into growing income of the Russian

late 2011 and early 2012**, the president fell back on starting a war
with the West, first **annexing Ukraine's Crimea**. This step eventually
rejoiced the society, resulting in Putin's extremely high approval
levels.]{.underline} This is yet over while the Russians need to
struggle with hiking taxes, higher pension rage and a drop in real
income, [all of which may inspire **Putin to break out a "small yet

# Russian Appeasement DA

## 1NC Shell

#### Trump currently is not pursuing an appeasement policy towards Russia -- deciding to send arms to Ukraine [specifically]{.underline} signals a hardline approach.

**Carpenter 3/25** (Ted Galen, Senior fellow in security studies at the
Cato Institute "The Myth that Won't Die: Donald Trump as Russia's
Puppet"
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/myth-wont-die-donald-trump-russias-puppet>)
NIJ

Donald [Trump's political adversaries]{.underline}, along with an
assortment of Russia haters in the foreign-policy community and the news
media, [keep pushing the narrative that Trump is Vladimir Putin's
puppet. That allegation shows few signs of dissipating even though no
credible evidence supporting it has emerged.]{.underline} Unfortunately,
the situation is unlikely to change even though Special Counsel Robert
[Mueller's investigation concluded that the Russian government's
meddling in the 2016 presidential election did not entail collusion with
the Trump campaign.]{.underline} Yet, shrill allegations of treason have
been commonplace, reaching a crescendo following last year's Trump-Putin
summit in Helsinki, when the president made some highly favorable
comments about his Russian counterpart. The innuendos and outright
accusations persist. And despite the bland outcome of the Mueller
investigation, congressional Democrats, most notably House Intelligence
Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), insist that they will continue to
investigate the "Russia collusion" angle. Russophobes seem to believe
that if they repeat an absurdity often enough, it somehow becomes true.
The myth that Trump has been Putin's puppet falls into that category.
Trump did commit the apparently unpardonable sin during the 2016
campaign of advocating better relations with Moscow, and he was guilty
of using effusive diplomatic language at Helsinki. But if one examines
his administration's actual policies toward Russia, the notion that he
is "doing Putin's bidding" or even pursuing an appeasement policy
evaporates. [Critics who contend otherwise need to cite specific Trump
administration policies that Putin welcomes. It would be a very
difficult task. It certainly would not be Russian enthusiasm about
Trump's decision to end U.S. adherence to the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty. The Kremlin reacted firmly to that action and
warned that Washington's withdrawal from the INF Treaty would compel
Russia to develop new missiles ; in response, Russia would resume
targeting U.S. bases in Europe and important assets of America's NATO
allies. That is a curious reaction from Putin if his aim was to prompt
his puppet to take that step. **It is also unlikely that Russia is happy
about the Trump administration's approval of two major arms sales to
Ukraine.**]{.underline} The latter sale in spring 2018 even included
Javelin anti-tank missiles. Since Moscow backs a secessionist war in
eastern Ukraine and is on very bad terms overall with the government in
Kiev, **[the U.S. decision to boost the military capabilities of
Russia's nemesis is a hostile act, not one of
appeasement.]{.underline}** [Indeed, it is a step that Barack Obama
pointedly refused to take. A similar escalation of Washington's support
for Kiev is evident with the Trump administration's program to to train
Ukrainian troops. Given the Kremlin's hostility to the expansion of
NATO's membership]{.underline} (a stance that existed even before Putin
became president), [Trump's alleged master cannot be pleased that his
agent endorsed the admission of Montenegro to the alliance and is
adopting the same view of Macedonia's impending bid. Such expansion
probably is even more galling since it continues Washington's
contemptuous attitude regarding Russian political, cultural and economic
interests in the Balkans---a policy that goes back well into the
nineteenth century. Moscow must be even more unhappy about the Trump
administration's failure to back off from Washington's stated goal to
bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO---a move that Russians across the
political spectrum regard as an intolerable provocation. It would be
peculiar if Putin was pleased about the frequent rotating deployments of
U.S. warplanes and military personnel to NATO members on Russia's
border. Indeed, the rotations are now so frequent that they amount to an
ongoing U.S. presence in all but name. That development is combined with
an intensification of both the number and size of NATO exercises (war
games) in both Eastern Europe and the Black Sea adjacent to
Russia.]{.underline} Given the reports that U.S. officials are now in
serious negotiations with Warsaw to build a permanent military base
(which the Polish president offered to name "Fort Trump" in a
transparent appeal to the U.S. president's notorious vanity) in eastern
Poland near the border with Russia; Putin's "puppet" appears to be
out-of-control. That problem also is apparent with respect to Trump's
treatment of Moscow's would-be allies and client states. Russia has
deployed its own military forces to Syria to help Bashar al-Assad retain
his precarious hold on power. Yet Trump has continued to back opposition
forces, and he launched missile strikes against Assad's air force in
response to his regime's supposed use of chemical weapons. Other attacks
on Syrian government positions have apparently killed approximately two
hundred Russian nationals working as contractors and mercenaries. The
Kremlin has pursued a policy of trying to forge close economic and even
military ties with Venezuela's leftist government headed by Nicolas
Maduro. Conversely, the Trump administration has clearly embarked on a
regime-change campaign to oust Maduro. Trump himself has insisted that
all options (implicitly including a military intervention) remain on the
table regarding that goal. It's hard to square such an aggressive stance
toward Russian clients like Assad and Maduro with the actions of someone
dedicated to appeasing Moscow, much less someone operating as a Russian
agent. **[It is long past time to scorn the "Trump is Putin's puppet"
allegation for the preposterous myth that it is. In reality, the Trump
administration has pursued a]{.underline}** disturbingly **[hardline
policy toward Russia]{.underline}**, deepening an already worrisome new
cold war. It is uncertain whether Trump's stance is an effort to
fend-off accusations of treason or if it merely reflects a dangerous
herd mentality in Washington about relations with Moscow. In either
case, the outcome has fomented unnecessary, potentially very dangerous,
bilateral tensions. If Trump's domestic political adversaries have
integrity and a sense of responsibility, then they will acknowledge that
the Mueller investigation did not find proof that Trump colluded with
Russia, and they will immediately abandon that ugly, false narrative.

#### Cutting arms sales to the Ukraine returns to the Obama-era policy of Russia appeasement---this [increases]{.underline} Russian aggression.

**Rothman 15** (Noah, Associate Editor of Commentary "America's
Appeasement of the Russian Bear"
<https://www.commentarymagazine.com/foreign-policy/europe/russia/americas-appeasement-of-the-russian-bear/>)
NIJ

[When charged with describing a policy of cowed deference to an
aggressor, a near pathological aversion among political commentators to
the word "appeasement" has hamstrung the West's ability to recognize
that policy when it is in practice.]{.underline} Just because the
disastrous Munich Agreement is often dubiously invoked does not mean
that it is never appropriate to call appeasement "appeasement." For
example, there is no better word than that to describe America's docile
response to Russian belligerence in its neighborhood[. Since the
collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact,
U.S. policy toward the region has been to reject the notion that Moscow
deserves any special influence over either its former vassal states or
the republics that once made up the USSR.]{.underline} And, before 2008,
America meant it. In March of 2004, a slew of former Warsaw Pact nations
including three former Soviet Republics in the Baltics joined the NATO
alliance. [In April 2008, NATO issued a statement welcoming the
"Euro-Atlantic aspirations" of Ukraine and Georgia, both of which had
already begun the process of ascension into the alliance.]{.underline}
In January 2008, over 72 percent of the Georgian public voted in favor
of joining NATO in a non-binding referendum. That same month, Ukraine's
administration was presented with a petition signed by two million
Ukrainians demanding a similar referendum vote. The polls indicated that
it was destined for approval and that both states would soon formally
pursue a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP). Everything changed that
August. On August 7, pro-Russian separatists began attacking Georgian
troops and giving Moscow the excuse it needed to intervene in the
conflict. On August 10, Russian forces poured over the Georgian border,
sacking city after city and eventually approaching the capital of
Tbilisi. The brief conflict was over in five days, but its effects were
far-reaching and permanent. The Georgian army was routed. Mikhail
Saakashvili's government was sapped of much of its legitimacy. The
provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia were effectively severed from
Georgian control and are now rogue breakaway proto-states that serve
Moscow's interests. The American reaction to Russia's aggression was
swift but insufficient. C-17s rushed humanitarian supplies to Tbilisi,
sanctions were imposed on Moscow, and elements of the American fleet
were soon parked off the country's coast in the Black Sea. It came too
late; the Russian army had achieved a swift victory. More disturbingly,
a new precedent had been set. From this point forward, Russian interests
in the territories it defined as its "near abroad" were to be respected.
[Barack Obama embraced the shortsighted policy of providing Moscow with
undue deference concerning its former Soviet sphere.]{.underline} The
president entered office married to the misperception that Bush-era
interventionism and "cowboy diplomacy" had led Vladimir Putin to embrace
irredentism. The president sacrificed the support of pro-Western
governments in Czech Republic and Poland to give Russia the gift of a
region free of interceptor missiles. The president acquiesced to Russian
demands that its client in Damascus, and Moscow's Syria-based
Mediterranean port, be preserved despite Bashar al-Assad's flagrant use
of chemical weapons on civilians. [Even after Russia invaded and annexed
Ukrainian territory, Barack Obama acceded to the Russian
demand]{.underline} that arms and ballistic missile embargos on Iran be
lifted as part of a nuclear accord -- creating new and legal markets for
Russian armaments. [Make no mistake; renewed Russian aggression in
Europe is owed to the Obama administration's careless telegraphing of
its disinterest in enforcing the prohibition on Russian interference in
the affairs of the former Soviet Republics. Washington did not react
with vehemence when Euromaidan protests evolved into civil conflict in
Kiev, prompting Russian armed forces to build up on its border with
Ukraine. Washington did not signal more than modest discomfort with
Russia's decision to take in former Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovych following his ouster. Finally and most egregiously,
Washington did not respond with appropriate resolve when Russian forces
invaded the Crimean Peninsula, sealed it off from Ukraine, installed a
puppet regime, and created the condition that led to its annexation into
Russia proper.]{.underline} In Fact, the Obama administration was
allegedly complicit in this violation of the post-World War II order in
Europe. According to the reporting of Bloomberg's Eli Lake and Josh
Rogin, Washington advised the interim government in Kiev to stand down
as Russian forces carved off Crimea. "As U.S. officials told us
recently, the White House feared that if the Ukrainian military fought
in Crimea, it would give Putin justification to launch greater military
intervention in Ukraine," the report read. "Looking back today, [many
experts and officials point to the decision not to stand and fight in
Crimea as the beginning of a Ukraine policy based on the assumption that
avoiding conflict with Moscow would temper Putin's aggression. **But
that was a miscalculation."** **Despite the acknowledgment that a policy
of submissiveness toward Russia was a miscalculation, this has not
compelled American officials to abandon it.**]{.underline} The Obama
administration responded to the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent
destabilization of its eastern provinces in much the same way the Bush
administration did to the invasion of Georgia. [Washington provided
Ukrainian troops with non-lethal military and humanitarian
aid]{.underline}, imposed sanctions on Moscow, and moved naval assets to
the region. [None of this has had the effect of tempering Putin's
aggression. Indeed, the Kremlin has only grown more erratic, more
insular, and more unstable.]{.underline} In September of last year, the
Russian military pulled off an under-reported coup. Using smoke grenades
and communications jamming technology, Russian operatives allegedly
violated Estonian territory and kidnapped a border guard. Under the
pretense that this Estonian soldier had crossed over into Russian
territory, he was captured and transported to Moscow to stand trial.
Russia reneged on a promise to release him earlier this year and,
instead, sentenced the soldier to 15 years of hard labor. "Estonia's
president, Toomas Henrik Ilves, has compared this to cases of Soviet
troops killing Baltic border guards prior to the Soviet invasion and
takeover of the Baltic states in 1940," COMMENTARY's Max Boot noted. The
State Department offered a meek statement of disapproval, but there has
been little else in the way of condemnation for this egregious violation
of the sovereignty of an NATO-member state. **[America's policy toward
Russia is one of appeasement]{.underline}** and, despite assurances to
the contrary, the respect of Russian rights in its Soviet-era zone of
influence. **[Don't be surprised to see more aggression from an
emboldened Moscow as a result.]{.underline}**

"Putin is preparing to fight and win a limited nuclear war against the
West, Skobov says"

NIJ

**[Putin is preparing to fight and win a limited nuclear war, convinced
that "the effete West will refuse to escalate" in response lest that
lead to a nuclear Armageddon that will destroy both the Russian
Federation and the West]{.underline}**, according to Moscow commentator
Aleksandr Skobov. [The Cold War doctrine was based on the assumption
that neither super power would ever use nuclear weapons for offense but
only in defense and that both would be prepared to escalate if the other
acted first, an assumption that provided less certainty that war could
be avoided than many now believe]{.underline}, Skobov says. On the one
hand, [each side had developed plans for using tactical and then
strategic weapons if the other side used them. And on the other, the
commentator continues, both had to continue to invest in ever more
apocalyptic weapons as the last line of defense of what each viewed as
its civilizational model.]{.underline} According to Skobov, "both sides
were certain of the superiority of their own social system and in the
eventual collapse of the social system of their opponent in a global
defeat in the historical competition." In essence, "both sides
considered a global military clash with their historical opponents as
practically inevitable." Moreover, [both sides concluded that they might
be pushed to the use of nuclear weapons if the use of conventional ones
was not allowing them to win out.]{.underline} NATO doctrine held that
in the event of a Soviet tank thrust into Europe, the western alliance
would have to use tactical nuclear weapons. "In the USSR," Skobov
continues, "the doctrine of 'a responsive nuclear strike' was adopted
officially, but in fact, the General Staff considered a sufficient basis
for a \[Soviet\] nuclear strike only the possibility that the first
strike might be inflicted by \[the USSR's\] opponents." And because
neither side could be certain what might happen, each was prepared to
escalate in response, something that both sides recognized and that was
ultimately the reason that neither side used those weapons against the
other lest its civilizational model be destroyed along with the world.
"Until Gorbachev's perestroika," Skobov says, "all attempts not only to
begin the process of disarmament or even to freeze the number of weapons
at a certain level turned out to be hopeless" as a result. "All
'pre-perestroika' Soviet-American treaties were only agreements about
reducing the tempo of the building of arms." The world was thus drifting
toward a nuclear war, a horrific outcome that was prevented only by the
decision of the Soviet leadership under Gorbachev to reject its global
political goals, its ideology, its faith in the supremacy of its social
system, and its efforts to impose that system on others by defeating its
opponent. By refusing to view the West as an inevitable enemy, the
Soviet leadership made possible arms control deals that reduced the
number of nuclear weapons of the two sides by 80 percent. "Russian
imperialists call this a geopolitical capitulation, but the alternative
to it was nuclear war," Skobov argues. But now what Gorbachev did is
being reversed. [Putin's "organized criminal group" even though it has
not articulated an ideology views itself as "'the elect of history,'
called upon to send into the trash heap all this 'Western project' with
its 'false democracy,' 'false' humanism, and 'false' human
rights."]{.underline} This is not "a return to Soviet ideology," Skobov
insists. "The Soviet empire claimed that namely it was the true legal
heir of the Renaissance-Enlightenment project and the heir of 1789 which
proclaimed 'freedom, equality, and brotherhood.'" The Putinists, in
contrast, "are convinced that there are no 'true' human rights and that
democracy doesn't exist in nature." [For Putin and his acolytes, "there
is only loot and crude force and the eternal universal laws of criminal
groups."]{.underline} It "doesn't seek to be the heir of 1789: it
rejects that inheritance just as Hitler did." And that points up
something else: ["the ideological gap separating the Putin empire and
the West is much deeper than the one which divided the West and the
Soviet empire." Putin's "organized criminal group" may not believe that
Western elites have any moral limitations, "but it cannot but understand
that NATO does not have a single reason in the event of a military
conflict to use nuclear weapons first." That is because today, NATO has
superiority over Russia "in other kinds of arms."]{.underline} Equally,
the Putin people "cannot but know" that neither side has an effective
defense against strategic nuclear missiles "and in the coming decades
won't" either. To ensure that the principles of mutually assured
destruction continue to work as a constraint, Skobov says, "no new
"super weapons" are needed. [Then, why is Putin talking about them? In
fact, he isn't talking about strategic weapons that could be used to
bring on Armageddon but rather precisely targeted ones that could serve
as the weapon of choice for "a limited nuclear strike, including a first
strike" rather than in response to the actions of the West.]{.underline}
Putin is "certainly not preparing for complete mutual destruction,"
Skobov says. **["He is preparing for a limited nuclear war which he
hopes to win."]{.underline}** His hopes rest on his conviction that the
West now will not respond to a Russian use of tactical nuclear weapons
by escalating but by doing everything possible to de-escalate. As in the
first Cold War, the commentator continues, **["the world's slide toward
a nuclear catastrophe can be stopped only by Russia turning away from
its confrontation with the West"]{.underline}** based on Moscow's belief
that its system is superior and the West's is rotting from within
because it is not. But tragically, ["today there are no forces within
the country capable of turning Russia" in a different direction. And the
world is rapidly running out of time.]{.underline} "Therefore," Skobov
says, "the first order of business is the formation of a broad
international anti-Putin coalition, which recognizes the threat coming
from the Kremlin and is ready to respond to Putin's strike."

## Uniqueness

### Uniqueness -- Trump Hardlining Russia

#### Trump has been the toughest on Russia since the Cold War.

**Horsley 18** (Scott, NPR\'s Chief Economics Correspondent "Is Trump
The Toughest Ever On Russia?"
<https://www.npr.org/2018/07/20/630659379/is-trump-the-toughest-ever-on-russia>)
NIJ

President Trump is in the process of inviting Russian President Vladimir
Putin to come to Washington, D.C., this fall to continue the talks they
started in Helsinki earlier this week. It\'s another sign of Trump\'s
efforts to build closer ties with Moscow, even though he insists his
administration has taken a hard line toward Russia. [\"There\'s never
been a president as tough on Russia as I have been,\" Trump told
reporters]{.underline} on Wednesday. That might sound like hyperbole,
but in this case, [there\'s actually some basis for the president\'s
boast.]{.underline} [\"When you actually look at the substance of what
this administration has done, not the rhetoric but the substance, this
administration has been much tougher on Russia than any in the post-Cold
War era,\"]{.underline} said Daniel Vajdich, senior fellow at the
Atlantic Council. Take military spending: [Trump sought to add \$1.4
billion for fiscal year 2018 to the European Deterrence Initiative --- a
military effort to deter Russian aggression that was initially known as
the European Reassurance Initiative. That\'s a 41 percent increase from
the last year of the Obama administration. **The president also agreed
to send lethal weapons to Ukraine --- a step that Obama resisted.** And
Trump gave U.S. forces in Syria more leeway to engage with Russian
troops.]{.underline} \"Those loosened rules of engagement have resulted
in direct military clashes with Russian militants and mercenaries on the
ground, actually resulting in one incident in hundreds of casualties on
the Russian side,\" Vajdich said. The administration has also imposed
sanctions on dozens of Russian oligarchs and government officials. And
Trump has aggressively promoted U.S. energy exports, although so far
that hasn\'t created much competition for Russia\'s oil and gas.
\"Russian gas sales to Europe last year were at record levels,\" said Ed
Chow, who studies energy and national security at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. \"Russians will always have a cost
advantage. And if they want to protect market share, all they have to do
is lower the price.\" Whatever tough policies the White House may have
adopted toward Moscow also have to be weighed against Trump\'s rhetoric,
which is consistently friendly to Putin. He suggested inviting Russia to
rejoin the G-7, a group Moscow was suspended from following the illegal
annexation of Crimea. Trump also congratulated Putin on his suspect
re-election victory, despite explicit instructions from his advisers.
[\"There\'s a real disconnect between the president\'s words and the
underlying policy,\"]{.underline} said Richard Fontaine, president of
the Center for a New American Security. While Trump has no qualms about
criticizing leaders of allied countries like Germany\'s Angela Merkel,
Canada\'s Justin Trudeau or the U.K.\'s Theresa May, he almost always
treats Putin with kid gloves. \"The president very rarely speaks about
Putin\'s transgressions and when asked about them expresses the hope
that everyone can get along,\" said Fontaine, a former national security
adviser to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Just last week, Trump told
reporters in the U.K., \"If we could develop a relationship which is
good for Russia, good for us, good for everybody, that would be great.\"
He went on to remind May how he agreed to expel 60 Russians ---
diplomats and suspected intelligence agents --- last year in retaliation
for the suspected poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain. \"And Germany did
three,\" he added grimly. The Washington Post reported Trump was
irritated that the U.S. seemed to be taking stronger actions against
Moscow than the Europeans were. The president was also reportedly
reluctant to send those lethal weapons to Ukraine, arguing again that
Europe should take the lead. [However grudging Trump\'s moves against
Moscow might have been, though, his defenders say the actions speak for
themselves.]{.underline} \"It is hard for me to believe that he was
dragged kicking and screaming through each and every one of these
decisions,\" Vajdich said.

### Impact -- Baltic Invasion

Escalation Scenarios," 3/28/18,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/03/28/three-escalation-scenarios-pub-75882>,
AS)

[The]{.underline} first [scenario **starts with a Russian land grab in
the Baltics.**]{.underline} To be very clear, this is an extreme
scenario; an overwhelming majority of Western experts, including NATO
staff, consider it to be a "remote" possibility.1 Nevertheless, [there
are good reasons to consider this]{.underline} extreme [set of
circumstances. First, it is a high-risk scenario, based on low
probability but **with high potential consequences**. Second, many
allies are worried about it.]{.underline} [And third, this scenario
might look less unlikely after the Russian use of force in Georgia and
Ukraine. Stage One:]{.underline} The year 2018 sees the return of
large-scale protests to major Russian cities. Suddenly, Vladimir Putin's
hold on power no longer seems a given. Only two weeks after the first
protests, [the Russian General Staff announces a large military exercise
in Russia's Western Military District, close to the border of
Latvia.]{.underline} Implications: [This combination of events would put
NATO on notice]{.underline} about the internal developments in Russia
and the announced military exercise, [and]{.underline} these events
would [raise serious concerns that Russia's leadership might be planning
to create an international crisis to divert attention from a domestic
crisis.]{.underline} At the same time, however, strong voices within
NATO would almost certainly caution against overreacting to these
events. They could argue that if NATO were to react militarily---by, for
example, deciding to send temporary reinforcements, even perhaps only
one additional battalion---to alleviate the concerns of Baltic nations,
doing so would risk giving the Kremlin reason to up the ante. Indeed,
deploying EFP forces in the region to the border area or even just
raising their state of alert might be perceived by Russia as an
aggressive move. Given these trade-offs, [it is quite likely that NATO
would react in a rather reserved way, which would give Russia an
important advantage in terms of mobilizing its forces. Stage Two: Sudden
protests by the Russian minority community in Latvia's easternmost
Latgale region spiral out of control with several
fatalities.]{.underline} While NATO ambassadors are gathering for an
emergency meeting, [Putin warns NATO "not to interfere in the internal
affairs of Latvia" and assures his domestic audience that "**Russia will
not idly stand by as Russians are being slaughtered
abroad."**]{.underline} Implications: For the alliance, [the sudden
occurrence of serious protests in Latvia---whether or not instigated by
Moscow---in conjunction with a domestic crisis in Russia and an arms
buildup close to Latvia would immediately raise the severity of the
crisis. The possibility of Russia escalating]{.underline} the conflict
with NATO, which might have seemed rather low at Stage One, [would
suddenly become more realistic.]{.underline} (Indeed, similar Russian
statements about the security of Russians living abroad were made ahead
of Moscow's interventions in Georgia and Ukraine.2) For the alliance,
sudden protests in Latvia---in conjunction with a domestic crisis in
Russia and an arms buildup close to Latvia--- would immediately raise
the severity of the crisis. [That said, there would nonetheless still be
a real possibility that allies would hold divergent interpretations of
these events]{.underline}, and it is unclear whether the EFP would be
ordered to immediately leave its base near Riga, at least to patrol the
border with Russia.3 Even though NATO insists that the EFP has no role
to play in a domestic unrest scenario, some allies might question that
logic, given that events may be instigated by Russia as it looked to
invade. Debates at NATO Headquarters on these issues could get
acrimonious. Some allies would probably worry that such actions as well
as NATO preparations to send additional forces to the region could be
escalatory. The alliance could well look, and perhaps be, divided.
[Again, NATO might still wait to avoid giving Russia any pretext to
intervene. Stage Three: Russian forces cross the border into Latvia and
occupy the Latgale region. President Putin makes a press announcement
that "Russia's humanitarian intervention stops here and now." **NATO
defense ministers meet and issue an ultimatum, demanding full Russian
withdrawal.**]{.underline} Implications: At this point, debates within
NATO about the severity of the Russian threat would be overtaken by
events. **[NATO would be presented with a military fait
accompli.]{.underline}** While [this situation]{.underline} already
would be very challenging to handle, it [might be further complicated if
Russian forces met only minimal resistance from Latvian forces and
perhaps none at all from the EFP.]{.underline} (Given the distance
between their base in Riga and the Latgale region, there would be a
serious risk that they would not arrive quickly enough to resist Russian
forces.) In this case, [regional EFP commanders]{.underline}---who, in
the case of Latvia, come from six different contributing
nations---[might be confronted with a choice between engaging
immediately in a futile fight that they would be certain to lose or
holding back to await further instructions from NATO
Headquarters.]{.underline} Worse still, some commanders might even
receive orders from their own national commands, bypassing the NATO
chain of command and possibly complicating a collective response. [One
potential outcome would be paralysis. Conversely, there would also be a
real possibility that an EFP commander---having received divergent
orders from NATO, the host nation (Latvia), and national lines of
command]{.underline}---[might decide to engage in combat before NATO's
political leaders have decided to invoke Article V.]{.underline}
Regardless of exactly how the fight was playing out in the theater, [the
NAC would]{.underline}, at this stage, [have to determine **whether or
not to invoke Article V** and whether or not to go to war with
Russia]{.underline} in an environment where the scope of the Russian
campaign would still look rather limited (as no allied forces from
France, Germany, the United Kingdom, or the United States would be
involved yet). Even if Article V were triggered, certain allies might
still advocate for a diplomatic solution. A possible compromise might
see allies starting immediate preparations for military reinforcement in
parallel with heightened crisis diplomacy. [Stage Four: NATO is ready to
deploy the Spearhead Force from Ramstein, Germany, and starts
preparations for assembling the rest of the eNRF.]{.underline}
Simultaneously, [the United States starts flying in additional personnel
and equipment]{.underline} to Western Europe and Poland. [Putin claims
that "NATO is provoking an unnecessary war."]{.underline} In many
European capitals tens of thousands take to the streets, urging Russia
and NATO to "end the mutual violence." Implications: NATO, having
started its military preparations, would face another tough choice.
While the Spearhead would be ready in less than a week, assembling the
rest of the eNRF would take longer (in all likelihood, a couple of
weeks). A decision would have to be made whether to deploy the Spearhead
right away, and risk losing it almost immediately in the theater, or to
wait for assembling the full manpower of the eNRF. If NATO were to wait,
the louder the voices of opposition to any military response could grow.
Indeed, large-scale protests in Western Europe, perhaps fueled by
subversive Russian propaganda, would very likely further affect and
complicate NATO's political decisionmaking.4 [In this
situation]{.underline}, some allies might opt out of a military
response, while others---[the United Kingdom and the United
States]{.underline}, most likely---[could bypass NATO's slow
mobilization process and **move forward with their own deployment
plans.** This contingency]{.underline}---in which some allies hesitate
to engage and others push forward---[could effectively paralyze the
alliance]{.underline} as a collective decisionmaking entity. In any
case[, NATO might well have to deal]{.underline}, at some point, [with
further Russian efforts to escalate the conflict by targeting critical
NATO transportation nodes]{.underline} with precision-guided
conventional strikes so as to prevent or at least complicate NATO
preparations for retaliation.5 From a Russian perspective, waiting for
NATO to muster a force of perhaps 100,000 personnel---which is what
would be required to be credible enough to fight a regional war with
Russia with the aim of retaking and securing the Baltics or perhaps even
extending combat operations into Russian territory---would hardly be an
option.6 In any case, NATO might well have to deal, at some point, with
further Russian efforts to escalate the conflict by targeting critical
NATO transportation nodes. But [even if Russia were to shy away from
further escalation]{.underline} (it might, for example, decide against
striking Western Europe because of the risk that doing so would unify
the alliance), [NATO's next move---laying the groundwork for force
deployment to the Baltics---would almost necessarily involve
**escalating the conflict horizontally into Russian
territory.**]{.underline} Because NATO has decided against
pre-positioning heavy military equipment in the Baltics, allies would
have to fly in personnel and equipment with large transportation
aircraft, which would be easy targets for Russian air defense systems
around the Baltic Rim. [If NATO wanted to avoid losing much of its first
reinforcement wave]{.underline} before it actually reached the ground,
[it would have to target Russian anti-access and area denial
installations, effectively extending combat operations into Russian
territory. Stage Five: NATO receives intelligence reports that Russia is
readying some of its tactical nuclear weapons stored in western Russia.
Putin warns that "**the two sides are on the brink of a nuclear
armageddon.**"]{.underline} Implications: Assuming that NATO had decided
on a concrete deployment plan by this point, [NATO leaders would have to
decide whether to move forward]{.underline} given the possibility of
Russia escalating to actual nuclear use. [That decision]{.underline}
would almost certainly cause serious frictions within the alliance and
[could further delay a military response.]{.underline} If NATO leaders
weathered those quarrels and pressed on, NATO might then immediately be
confronted with a second serious dilemma, stemming from NATO's
long-standing internal disputes about its nuclear deterrent. [Over the
years, Russia might have arrived at the conclusion that NATO would not
use nuclear weapons]{.underline}---even in response to Russian nuclear
use---[in a limited regional scenario.]{.underline} As a result, [Moscow
might feel tempted to escalate to nuclear use in the hope of stopping
NATO in its tracks before it could deploy forces.]{.underline} In this
case, **[all of NATO's possible nuclear
countermeasures]{.underline}**---rhetorical nuclear threats; so-called
slow nuclear signals in the form of readying NATO's forward-deployed
nuclear forces (which would take a few weeks); or so-called fast
signals, such as U.S. B-52 deployments to Western Europe (which could be
executed within hours)---[**could be misperceived in Moscow as mere
bluffs.** The interplay between Russia doubting NATO's resolve and NATO
having difficulties making its nuclear threats credible would create a
**number of pathways for escalation through misperception.** One
possibility would be NATO proceeding with its deployment
preparations]{.underline} absent its own distinct response to Russia's
nuclear threats. [In this event, Russia might escalate to nuclear use
out of concern that a regional conventional war with NATO could result
in a Russian defeat, and perhaps the loss of Kaliningrad or even other
Russian territory. According to two Russian military experts, "Strategic
deterrence]{.underline} with conventional weapons of a potential
aggressor state (or coalition of states) from undertaking a large-scale
or regional war is unlikely. It [**is possible only by the threat of
preventive nuclear actions.**"]{.underline}7 [Stage Six: U.S. satellites
detect a small-yield nuclear explosion over a remote area in the North
Sea.]{.underline} Implications: At this point, NATO would face the dire
situation of Russia having escalated to actual nuclear use in the form
of a single demonstration strike over international waters. [The Russian
strike would]{.underline} most likely [not eradicate the dilemmas NATO
would be facing]{.underline} already at Stage Five, when Russia was only
threatening nuclear use, [but instead make those dilemmas more
pressing.]{.underline} In concrete terms, [NATO members would now have
to decide whether to move forward with the alliance's deployment plans,
stop in its tracks (obviously intimidated by Russian nuclear use),
or]{.underline} perhaps [**respond with nuclear use.**]{.underline} The
latter option---nuclear use by the allies---in particular would most
likely be highly contested within NATO. Given that the Russian
demonstration strike would not have been directed against NATO
territory, the risk of further nuclear escalation if NATO were to
reciprocate, rapidly mounting domestic pressures in Western Europe to
"avoid a nuclear holocaust," and NATO's (though comparably slow) ability
to muster a significant conventional force, [the alliance's members
might decide against nuclear use]{.underline}. At the same time, [that
might only help to **reinforce the Russian (mis)perception** that NATO
really tends to shy away from nuclear use in a crisis.]{.underline} NATO
would therefore be hard-pressed to show serious nuclear signals below
the level of actual use, such as U.S. B-52 deployments to Western
Europe. In turn, Russia, having just escalated to nuclear use, would
face a no less dire situation, given that Moscow might feel that it had
played its final card in an escalatory game aimed at preventing NATO
from deploying forces to the Baltics. [If NATO were to continue with its
mobilization and deployment plans, Russia would have little choice other
than to escalate the conflict further into NATO
territory]{.underline}---perhaps by aiming conventional strikes at
NATO's western transportation nodes or perhaps by conducting additional
nuclear strikes---or back down. Either way, Moscow would have to fear
that its escalation strategy would solidify NATO's assertiveness rather
than undermine its cohesion.

## Ukraine Nationalism Scenario

### Brink

#### Ukraine is on the brink in all aspects 

**Stein 19** \[Samuel Stein, Graduate Center of University of New York,
1-27-2019, \"Ukraine on the Brink,\" Jacobin Magazine,
<https://jacobinmag.com/2019/01/ukraine-maidan-protests-elections-volodymyr-ishchenko>\]
AK

[When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, its former republics'
economies went into free fall. Ukraine --- the most populous of the new
states, after Russia --- was no exception: average incomes and life
expectancy declined as violent crime soared. It had been a center of
heavy industry in the Soviet Union, but during the 1990s its industrial
facilities were sold off at bargain prices to figures linked to its
political leadership.]{.underline} From 1994 that leadership was
dominated by President Leonid Kuchma, a former factory manager who
attempted but ultimately failed to keep both Russia and the West on its
side. By the turn of the millennium, Ukraine's economy had stabilized
--- but [most Ukrainians were still desperately poor, and the
conspicuous wealth of a small minority fueled popular conviction that
the country's resources were being stolen.]{.underline} Gradually,
Kuchma came to be seen as emblematic of that theft. In neighboring
Russia, the chaos and relative openness of the 1990s was giving way to
Putin's new authoritarian order as political freedom was traded for a
measure of stability. **[It gradually became clear that there would be
no such consolidation in Ukraine. In December 2000, a series of
recordings was leaked in which President Kuchma discussed abducting the
journalist Georgi Gongadze, as well as concealing the proceeds of
corruption]{.underline}**. The resulting protests were suppressed, and
Kuchma remained in place, but the groundwork had been laid for much
larger demonstrations --- the so-called "Orange Revolution" --- that
came four years later after vote-rigging by Kuchma's would-be successor,
Viktor Yanukovych, in the 2004 presidential election. A rerun of that
contest handed power to Western-leaning Viktor Yushchenko, whose tenure
combined some economic growth with rising inequality --- and spanned the
2008 financial crisis, which further impoverished ordinary Ukrainians.
In the next election, in 2010, Yushchenko lost to the opportunistic
Yanukovych. Having indicated that he would sign an association agreement
with the European Union, in the autumn of 2013 Yanukovych bent to
pressure (and incentives) from Putin and changed his mind. Demonstrators
once again gathered in Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence
Square), leading to the president's removal from power. Sociologist
Volodymyr Ishchenko was present throughout the protest movements of the
2000s and became a prominent analyst of the 2013--14 Maidan protests. In
this interview, Ishchenko reflects on the legacy of Maidan and the
events of the five years that have elapsed since, as well as looking
ahead to the presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled to take
place in 2019. JP In late February 2014, as a post-Maidan interim
administration took power in Kiev, you
[wrote](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/ukraine-genuine-revolution-tackle-corruption)
that [the new government "is likely only to aggravate" the poverty and
inequality that forms "the root of pervasive corruption in
Ukraine."]{.underline} You said that ["the socioeconomic demands of the
Maidan movement have been replaced with the neoliberal agenda of the new
government."]{.underline} What were those demands, and has any progress
been made in reasserting them since? VI "Demands" was not really the
best wording; [we would more accurately speak of grievances. Some of the
grievances that pushed masses of Ukrainians into the streets in 2013
were socioeconomic in nature. Polls among the Maidan protestors said the
most popular concern was fighting corruption. Many also connected the
European Union with their own aspirations for higher living standards,
for jobs, for a "normal" life.]{.underline} But the problem was that
such grievances were not articulated into any clear progressive agenda.
The political representation of the movement ranged from right wing to
far right. Of course, the Maidan protests did involve a mass
mobilization of regular citizens. But certain organizations played a
particularly important role in sustaining this mobilization and in
coordinating a large protest infrastructure spanning multiple regions.
The organized part of the Maidan coalition included three opposition
parties. Two were the Tymoshenko and Klitschko parties. Even the fact
that it's simpler to identify them by the leaders' names, not by their
ideologies, already says a lot about Ukrainian politics. These parties
above all represent the interests of specific financial-industrial
groups (often they are loosely called "oligarchs"): politically, they
can be very opportunistic and can shift between various kinds of
populism before adopting neoliberalism once in power. But [the third
party was more ideological, namely the far-right Svoboda ("Freedom")
Party --- the radical Ukrainian nationalists. More extreme but marginal
radical nationalist groups united under the Right Sector umbrella. Then
there were a number of small but Western-supported NGOs, some focused on
human rights, others on neoliberal reforms, others on fighting
corruption. Neither the NGOs nor the parties could articulate any
progressive, egalitarian agenda. It was pretty clear from the outset
that even progressive liberals were in the minority, never mind
socialists.]{.underline} They were only loosely organized, and had no
substantial influence, either on the development of the protests or on
their ideological framing. They were probably more important in terms of
framing the protests for parts of the Western audience which, in a kind
of wishful thinking, focused on the most progressive elements of the
movement but not the much stronger reactionary ones. From the outset it
was clear that if the Maidan protests succeeded, they would bring
right-wing opposition parties to power. What we've seen in the five
years since then is that Ukraine has become poorer. [The IMF recently
updated their global statistics on GDP per capita, and Ukraine's is now
the lowest in Europe. The only countries even lower down the scale are
located in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Ukraine is the
northernmost of the Global South --- and not just in terms of economic
statistics. Its economic structure is also more typical of the Third
World: it is export-oriented and primarily focused on raw materials. And
unlike Southeast Asia, Ukraine is not industrializing but
deindustrializing --- particularly because the most advanced parts of
Ukrainian industry, which were inherited from the Soviet Union and
primarily served the markets of the former Soviet republics, have been
harmed by the introduction of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area
with the European Union; they are not usually competitive on global
markets. A significant part of those industries is located in Donbass,
where the war is going on.]{.underline} Nor do Ukraine's politics seem
to be moving toward the European norm, as we are told. Oligarchs
dominate mainstream politics and own all the major TV channels ---
independent ones remain marginal. Paramilitaries play a role in
Ukrainian politics not seen in any other country in Europe: it is a
situation more like Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa. JP As the
Maidan protests reached their crescendo, you
[wrote](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/07/ukrainian-protesters-break-with-far-right)
that "the Maidan movement must decisively break away from the
far-right," warning that although "the far right are not numerically
dominant in Maidan ... neofascists have become normalised as a
legitimate part of the movement." To what extent have ultranationalists
managed to maintain this foothold? VI The far right was unable to
capitalize on the protests in parliamentary terms: Svoboda lost seats in
2014 and the Right Sector didn't get into parliament, although they do
have a chance in the parliamentary elections scheduled for autumn 2019.
There are already talks among some far-right parties to unite into a
joint nationalist bloc, which would have a very good chance of getting
into parliament (although they have thus far failed to agree on a
candidate for the presidential elections, which are scheduled to take
place in the meantime). Many argue that this lack of parliamentary
representation means that all the talk about Ukrainian fascists and the
far right is simply Russian propaganda. But this is wrong --- at the
extra-parliamentary level, the radical nationalists have become much
stronger. No party or coalition of liberal NGOs can mobilize so many
people on the streets as the Ukrainian nationalists do every year on
their key dates. These include the day of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army,
which is now a national holiday in Ukraine (it wasn't before Maidan),
and the birthday of Stepan Bandera (the leader of the Ukrainian
nationalists during World War II, and of a movement which conducted
ethnic cleansing of the Polish population in western Ukraine, as well as
collaborating with the Nazis in the Holocaust). The nationalists gather
tens of thousands of people for these rallies, and it's incomparable to
anything that the liberals can mobilize. [The radical nationalists have
also acquired arms, and since the start of the war in the Donbass they
have formed many of the most prominent volunteer battalions. The most
important was Azov, which started as a battalion and is now a regiment.
In 2014 these were more like independent, autonomous forces, but
gradually the government tried to incorporate them into the official law
enforcement structures]{.underline}. Today Azov is officially a regiment
within the National Guard. [This was "necessary" in order to take at
least some control over these units, but also means that we now have
ideological nationalists within the official law enforcement
structures.]{.underline} [This has many dangerous consequences, for
example in terms of the police's treatment of nationalist attacks on
minorities --- they don't intervene seriously, and sometimes they even
help the nationalists and blame the victims.]{.underline} That's just
one example, and of course this helps cover up the far right's crimes.
Today the deputy chief of the national police is a former neo-Nazi who
was Azov's deputy commander. Having someone in such a high position is
obviously an asset for Azov and other radical nationalists. Some
liberals try to argue that the nationalists in Ukraine are not
important, that they're irrelevant, not represented in parliament ---
compared with the results of forces like the Front National, or
Alternative für Deutschland. They say "Just look, Le Pen got over 30
percent in the elections, and Ukrainian nationalists didn't even manage
to get into parliament!" But an obvious question here would be: how many
battalions does Le Pen have? None. Here, every more-or-less-important
far-right party has an affiliated armed unit, which would be a very
important factor in the case of a major political crisis --- a resource
that they could use, even if not for taking power, then for influencing
the composition of the government and the results of elections. Among
liberals there is a strong trend not to recognize the problem, to
justify nationalists, to downplay the danger --- because otherwise, it
would play into the hands of Russian propaganda. This is a very
dangerous position which helps to cover nationalist violence.
Outrageously, respectable liberal media like BBC Ukraine have given
sympathetic reports on a neo-Nazi terror group, C14, whose major
activity is harassing and terrorizing opposition journalists, bloggers,
and citizens. In 2018 this group initiated a series of attacks on Roma
camps. And they long received primarily sympathetic reports, with
mainstream journalists trying to justify what they were doing, to find
excuses, to say that maybe they are just doing what the state doesn't
--- that the state doesn't repress that "fifth column," those
pro-Russian separatists, so these young "radical patriots" are just
doing the job of the state. And of course, this legitimizes even more
far-right violence. This also makes it hard to articulate this problem
for a Western audience, because you always get these so-called "friends
of Ukraine" who attack you as a Russian propagandist. In fact, when the
local opposition to the radical nationalists is so weak in Ukraine,
Western NGOs, international organizations, and even Western governments
could at least raise the problem of human rights violations. For
example, they press Ukraine hard on corruption, and have forced the
government to set up a system of anti-corruption institutions. Yet they
do not use their leverage to condemn the radical nationalist groups
which commit violence against political, gender, and ethnic minorities.
JP In November that year, you
[noted](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/13/ukraine-far-right-fascism-mps)
that "\[the far-right party\] Svoboda (as well as the Right Sector)
might well criticize the new government not only on nationalist grounds,
but also by highlighting a deteriorating economic situation." Indeed,
the far right often combines violent bigotry with a relatively
progressive economic stance; it is involved in vicious vigilante attacks
on Roma and other minorities but has also managed to gain a reputation
for providing practical support to poor communities. Can the Left learn
anything here? VI First, it's important to understand that radical
nationalists don't actually have so much popular support. It may seem
surprising, but they have more legitimacy within civil society than
among Ukrainian society at large --- many so-called "Ukrainian liberals"
are basically just moderate nationalists. The far-right parties'
electoral support, even if they were to unite, would at best be 5--10
percent. That's support for the parties --- support for some nationalist
ideas would be higher. The reason for this low support is that the
politics is dominated by much better-resourced oligarchic parties that
control the media and have money they can put into electoral campaigns.
In 2014, the oligarchic parties captured their nationalist-patriotic
rhetoric; and perhaps it didn't make so much sense to vote for the
radical nationalists if the so-called "centrists" were talking about the
same things. The oligarchic parties are also pretty good at capturing
social-populist rhetoric. It looks like neither Svoboda nor other
far-right parties can propose anything fundamentally different. The
major populist now is Yulia Tymoshenko --- the most probable winner of
the next elections. She's pretty strong in social populism, criticizing
high prices and even talking about stopping cooperation with the IMF. If
you have people like this, of very long standing in Ukrainian politics,
with resources and some oligarchic backing, then the far right don't
look like they're proposing anything much different, even if they also
talk about social redistribution. This is also a lesson for the Left. It
is often said that in speaking about identity politics the Western left
and has forgotten about material socioeconomic issues, and that's why
the far right is winning, as workers start to vote more for radical
nationalists and less for leftist parties. Ukraine actually gives
another lesson: that the Left must propose a really radical alternative
in terms of socioeconomic policies, and not simply some superficial
populist demands. These kinds of demands can easily be taken up by the
far right, by the right-wing populist parties, and if they can
capitalize on their better recognition and resources, and better
attitudes from parts of the media, they can outcompete the populist
left. So it is important that the Left develop a future-oriented,
consistent, progressive-looking agenda for radical social change. For
the Ukrainian left, the lessons of the Latin American left are probably
much more relevant than those of the current Western European left. We
can't simply copy tactics and rhetoric from Corbyn or Bernie Sanders,
Podemos or Syriza, because these parties are operating in
liberal-democratic regimes. The Ukrainian regime is definitely not
liberal-democratic --- it's increasingly authoritarian, nationalist, and
anticommunist. In this situation, the experience of the Latin American
left --- fighting pro-American right-wing dictatorships in the 1970s and
1980s, not necessarily in armed struggle but primarily by forming broad
democratic fronts --- could now be much more relevant for us. JP Is
there anything that the Ukrainian left in should learn from the far
right in terms of grassroots engagement with the poorest Ukrainians? VI
[I'm not sure that engagement with the poorest Ukrainians was really
such an important part of the far right's success. Svoboda at least
tried to form front groups to penetrate civil society and meet popular
needs through its own ideologically affiliated leisure and cultural
organizations. But I'm not sure this has really been so important for
their success.]{.underline} More important has been the far right's
readiness for and skills in violence. Generally, Ukrainian politics
before Maidan was very nonviolent. Before 2014 we hadn't seen anything
like, for instance, France's gilets jaunes protests. This means that two
generations of Ukrainians, those born since the 1950s, didn't have
direct experience of massive violent protests. The most violent event in
Ukraine before Maidan happened in 2001 during the opposition campaign
against the then-president Leonid Kuchma. The clashes lasted for an hour
or two, mainly between radical nationalists and the police, and involved
at most a few hundred people. [But the radical nationalists had the most
experience of violence among all protest groups and ideological
currents. They used these skills in the Maidan protests, when
opportunities for violent escalation were opened up by both the
extraordinary government repression and the moderate opposition's
inability to propose any effective nonviolent strategy against the
Yanukovych government. At this moment, the radical nationalists
intervened, and because of their skills at violence, their political
organization, and radical ideology, they could take up the role of a
violent vanguard for the movement. Violence is the most important
resource on which their limited popularity and success is
based.]{.underline} After Maidan they were ready to go to the war, to
form battalions, to fight --- and that has also aided their legitimacy
within Ukrainian civil society; they are "heroes" fighting for Ukraine.
This readiness for violence was probably much more important than their
work with the poorest Ukrainians: I can't say they even had a consistent
strategy for this, or really did anything important. JP The poet Serhii
Zhadan
[said](https://www.facebook.com/HromadskeInternational/videos/251492172175472/)
recently that in Ukraine, "You can call 'left-wing' anybody you don't
like; this is a very good way to hurt somebody." Indeed, in the
discussion in which he was speaking, Oleksandr Sushko, the director of a
prominent NGO, sought to equate the "far left" with the far right. Are
attempts to discredit the very notion of the Left gaining ground in
Ukraine? VI Generally, yes. This is indeed a quite popular position in
civil society, which is usually strongly anticommunist. When the
government started its decommunization policies --- renaming streets and
cities and dismantling remaining Soviet monuments --- there was very
little public resistance. These policies laid the basis for banning the
Communist Party of Ukraine; the irony with this ban was that the party
was neither communist nor dangerous in any way, and was just a very easy
scapegoat that nobody would defend. The majority of Ukrainian civil
society took for granted that the ban was reasonable, although they had
banned a major opposition party --- something that should not be done in
any democratic polity. This was a party that had got 13 percent of the
vote as recently as 2012. The Left is politically nonexistent right now,
and so it becomes a scapegoat, an empty signifier onto which some groups
project everything bad. Nationalists very often attack the Left, but by
"the Left" they mean anyone who is for human rights, for minority
rights, who supports LGBT people. But subjectively most of these people
are liberals, often distant from Western leftist parties; they would
usually even share in popular conspiracy theories that the Left are
pro-Russian and paid by the Kremlin to undermine Western governments. JP
Given how easy it is in Ukraine for any explicitly left politics to be
smeared by association with the country's Soviet past, should emergent
left groups abandon tradition left imagery and language and build a new
idiom and aesthetics in which to couch radical social demands? VI It's
not a problem only with aesthetics, and it's not even a problem of the
Left's choices, because communist symbols are now banned, and use of
those symbols could be grounds for criminal prosecution. There have
indeed been some ridiculous cases where people got two years' probation
--- so, a criminal sentence --- for writing Soviet-era slogans on
Facebook. This is not really systematic, but occasionally it happens.
The ban on the Communist Party has minimized its public activity, and
the public activity of other left groups is also pretty minimal. It's
even difficult to have a public event without hiding its physical
location; usually, we have a preliminary registration where we try to
check the people who want to come to our event, and we send the address
only to those people we are sure are not radical nationalists and will
not leak the location. So, this is a semiunderground mode of activity.
So, I don't think that the aesthetics are actually a problem, because
even those groups that are trying to be as pro-Ukrainian and as
anticommunist as possible, while appealing to left ideas, remain largely
unsuccessful --- they're as marginal as the rest of the Left. The
problem is probably more general: the repressive political regime,
strong right-wing paramilitaries, the lack of resources, the weakness of
labor or any other progressive grassroots movements. All this encloses
the political left in a marginal niche. JP On November 26, a thirty-day
period of martial law was declared across a large swath of Ukraine after
three of its naval vessels came under fire from Russian ships. How do
you interpret the origins of this situation, and will it affect the
presidential election, scheduled for March 31? VI [The incident itself
owed either to the stupidity of some of those involved, or to an
intentional provocation by the Ukrainian ships, possibly connected to
the president. Even if we do not accept the Russian annexation of
Crimea, and all its consequences, it doesn't mean we can ignore the
reality of Russian control over the Crimean Peninsula and the adjacent
waters of the Black and Azov seas. And here the Ukrainian ships tried to
ignore this fact.]{.underline} Yet the problem is not so much what
exactly happened, but how it was used by the president. [On the same
day, he called for a Security Council meeting, which proposed the
introduction of martial law. The next day, parliament didn't accept the
original proposal --- martial law over the whole territory of Ukraine
for two months --- because this would have meant postponing the
elections scheduled for March 2019.]{.underline} Indeed, it seems the
Western leaders whom Poroshenko consulted were also very concerned at
this possibility. In the end, parliament voted for martial law only for
the half of Ukraine adjacent to Russia, to the Black and Azov seas, and
to Transnistria --- mainly regions in which the majority of citizens
have an oppositional attitude and do not support the president. Some
politicians have described this as a victory for the Ukrainian
parliament --- that it didn't allow a coup d'etat by the president. But
the fact is that martial law in any form was unnecessary, because there
were no serious grounds to believe that the threat from Russia would
grow. There have been many other cases in recent years where there was a
real threat to the Ukrainian army: it suffered serious defeats in 2014
and 2015, and in those cases Poroshenko didn't call for martial law
because he was interested in the elections and in stable financing from
the IMF. Now, before the elections, he is suddenly calling for martial
law after a relatively marginal incident. Despite this, a quite large
majority in parliament supported a more limited version of martial law.
I expected that this would give Poroshenko a strong pretext for further
such measures, and incentivize him to escalate matters in Donbass or,
better, to conspire in some bloody incident in Odessa or Kharkov. That
could really have contributed to the atmosphere of fear. This would also
have provided good grounds for postponing elections that Poroshenko now
has very little chance of winning. He's very unpopular --- polls tell us
he is uncertain to reach the second round, where he would in any case
lose to any of his main rivals. However, he has not yet made such moves.
This is most likely because of his dependency on or at least
vulnerability to the West, where he keeps some of his own valuable
assets. The West sent clear messages against a prolonged state of
martial law. And this also suggests that the Kremlin is betting not so
much on destabilizing Ukraine as on the victory of politicians
friendlier (or less averse) to Russia in the parliamentary elections in
autumn 2019 or even in the electoral cycle that follows. Even faced with
a perfect opportunity to provoke Poroshenko, feeding a wider mistrust in
the president and extra-parliamentary opposition on the streets, it
looks like Putin is more interested in the elections. JP The current
front-runner to be elected Ukraine's next president is Yulia Tymoshenko.
Her positions are rather contradictory: she wants Ukraine to move
towards the EU and NATO, but also claims to stand against some elements
of IMF-mandated austerity. What should we think of her? VI She's just an
opportunist populist. She's not so much ideologically pro-EU and
pro-NATO; she just understands that the core electorate would probably
not accept any other geopolitical orientation. She needs to take this
line because otherwise Poroshenko would attack her as pro-Russian --- as
he has actively been doing already. He recalls that in 2009 Tymoshenko
made a deal with Putin over natural gas that turned out to be
disadvantageous for Ukraine, for which she was imprisoned under the
Yanukovych government. As an example of her opportunism, while she
understood the political game Poroshenko was playing, she still voted
for martial law. Otherwise, pro-Poroshenko trolls and opinion leaders
would have attacked her: "Look, she's not patriotic, she's pro-Russian,
she's playing into the Kremlin's hands," and so on. Another problem with
Tymoshenko is that she is unpredictable, not only at the level of her
views on the EU and NATO. The same concerns her social populist
rhetoric. This is an easy way to criticize Poroshenko: nobody wants to
pay more for utilities and so on, and obviously most people don't want
austerity --- they are poor and do not see many prospects in this
country. But that doesn't mean a Tymoshenko administration will really
be more redistributive --- definitely not consistently. But it would
still be a good sign if the elections were to happen, and she were able
to compete on a more or less free and fair basis. Otherwise, it just
means that there is no change, no hope at all. For his part, Poroshenko
is now running on very nationalist grounds --- his major slogan is
"Army, Faith, and Language." The very possibility of changing the
president through elections is important for its own sake, even if
Tymoshenko doesn't look more progressive. JP You
[wrote](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/ukraine-communist-party-ban-hysteria)
at the end of 2015 that "The left flank of Ukrainian politics is vacant
for now but won't be for long." Is this space being occupied again? Are
there likely to be any presidential candidates, however marginal, who
could reasonably be called 'progressive'? VI No, unfortunately not. The
Communist Party has decided to take part in the elections and will
probably try to find some technical way to do this despite the ban. But
the same man has been leading the party since 1993 --- its
unchallengeable leader Petro Symonenko, who has absolutely no chance of
winning serious support. Not to mention the question of whether the
Communist Party is really progressive --- and there are many grounds for
believing that they stopped being so many years ago. [Ukrainian politics
doesn't have any left representation. In the current parliament there is
not a single left-wing party, however broadly defined. Not even the
neoliberal left; not even the opportunist or reformist left. Even more:
there is not a single leftist member of parliament.]{.underline} It
looks like this isn't going to change in the next elections. We'll see a
lot of flirtation with social populism, but this doesn't imply
egalitarian policies. The best outcome would be not a hope for change,
but that the country would not collapse in a total state failure after
the elections, which is not an impossible outcome --- considering the
martial law precedent, the probable electoral falsifications, and
activity of armed paramilitaries. This doesn't give much hope --- but I
believe that it's objective. The lack of a hope on the Left means the
country is losing a sense of the future. Even if Ukraine and
particularly the youth proclaims its pro-Western orientation, it
actually stands in contrast to North American and Western European youth
who are becoming more and more leftist, while Ukrainian younger
generation is more neoliberal and nationalist than the elder people. JP
You've called for the resurgence of an internationalist left in Ukraine.
Could such an approach really gain traction in the present political
landscape, or should the Left first win back its role as a leading force
of Ukrainian nationalism? VI [The basic problem here is not even the
Left's prospects in Ukraine, but whether the country itself has a
future. The state is undermined as social divisions intensify and pull
the country apart. This will not likely end up in a Libyan or
Syrian-style scenario, but these risks are pretty serious, and this is a
potential that must be recognized --- something must be done to stop it.
Against this background, the question of which kind of left we might
have is really rather marginal: there simply isn't one.]{.underline}
From my personal position, an internationalist left would be better than
a nationalist one. But it's also a problem of the general direction of
development of society. Of course, an internationalist left would much
more easily connect with the Western European left, with the North
American left, speaking to them in the same language and appealing to
the same problems. That would obviously be better for the development of
Ukraine's international connections, should progressive parties come to
power abroad. JP Looking at the global scene, are there any particular
social or political movements from which you think a nascent Ukrainian
left might draw practical lessons? VI As I said, [the Latin American
left probably has the most relevant lessons for the Ukrainian left. Of
course, we need to consider some very important differences between a
post-Soviet country and Latin American ones, but at least some of the
problems that they have faced --- with pro-American authoritarian
regimes, with oligarchs, with large inequality, with right-wing
paramilitaries sound pretty relevant to what we're experiencing now, and
this is definitely something to which the Ukrainian left needs to pay
much more attention. Developments in the Western left can also serve as
an inspiration, showing that not everywhere is headed in a reactionary
direction; there are strong political forces, that bear a progressive
agenda, that can seriously fight for power. This is itself an important
argument for us --- that the Left is something legitimate]{.underline}.
And, at least for those who look towards Europe as some kind of model,
this argument can have some some traction: that [these societies have a
left, and so should we]{.underline}. This may sound like a colonial
orientation: that we need a left because the West has one. [The major
point would be, that we need the left for Ukraine's own future --- not
just to copy-paste from Western models. If you would like to have this
country together, we need some space for leftist politics --- without
them, the country would probably just disappear. Progressive
developments are very unlikely, but the only alternative to it could be
Ukraine's total collapse.]{.underline}

which first spotted the rocket in social media posts, concluded that its
presence across Ukraine points to a more than symbolic contribution of
weapon systems from the United States. [The RPG-7 is a Russian-made
anti-tank grenade launcher that fires 40 mm rockets, and had long been
found in Ukrainian armories, according to the Atlantic Council. The
American PSRL-1 is supposed to be an upgrade on that RPG-7
design.]{.underline} The American version is fitted with a Picatinny
rail --- commonly found on M4 Carbines among other U.S. weapons --- for
mounting combat optics such as Eotech holographic sights, lasers,
tactical lights, and vertical fore-grips, according to an
AirTronicUSA [fact
sheet](http://www.airtronic-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/cutsheet-psrl.pdf) on
the weapon. The sale of the weapon appeared to be first announced in
December
by [Spetstechnoexport](http://spetstechnoexport.com/en/news/80), a
Ukrainian defense company, according to the Atlantic Council. [As a
country that has been bogged down in a low-kinetic conflict with Russian
proxy forces since 2014, Ukraine has long sought [lethal military
aid](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/12/23/us-agrees-to-send-lethal-weapons-to-ukraine-angering-russia/) from
the United States. Under the Obama administration, aid was allegedly
limited to [training and support
equipment](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/03/01/what-is-darpa-doing-in-ukraine/) out
of a fear of further aggravating tensions.]{.underline} Though, going
back to October 2016, the Atlantic Council noted that an
AirTronicUSA [press
release](http://www.airtronic-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/Press-Release-Airtronic-V.2-10.3.16.pdf) outlined
a pending sale of the PSRL-1 to an "Allied European military customer."
President Donald Trump began the process to clear sales of more lethal
aid in December, though it was commonly characterized as "defensive
lethal aid." [Javelin anti-tank
missiles](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/03/01/ukraine-officially-cleared-to-buy-javelin-weapons/) were
cleared for sale to Ukraine in March by the [U.S. State
Department](http://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/files/mas/ukraine_18-02.pdf) for
an estimated cost of \$47 million, which includes 210 missiles and 37
launchers. Apparently, however, small arms sales by private companies
have been ongoing since before then. [In a [December
interview](https://www.voanews.com/a/texas-company-lethal-weapons-ukraine/4135364.html) with
Voice of America, AirTronicsUSA Chief Operating Officer Richard Vandiver
said his company started delivering products to Ukraine last year, and
continues to do so today. Those sales have been limited to short-range
defensive weapons, like the PSRL-1. "Obviously, PSRL is a lethal system,
but it's a defensive lethal system," Vandiver told Voice of America. "As
long as the weapon system stays \[in government-controlled territory\],
it's not an offensive weapon, but if armor starts to cross the river
then I would assume that the Ukrainian defense forces would employ our
systems to stop the armor." Anti-tank weapons are key in the Ukrainian
conflict, where neither side is able to field effective air support due
to the presence of short-range air defense systems.]{.underline} The
conflict is currently sitting at a simmer, with not much change in
territory for either side. Still, Ukraine fears renewed Russian
aggression, if it does come, will arrive through armored tanks and
vehicles that would be difficult to repel without weapons like the
PSRL-1 or the infrared-guided Javelin missile.

modernization---coincidentally, something Russia's military has been
undergoing since 2008, with visible results. Ukraine's army lacks the
technical skills to operate and sustain its own equipment in combat, and
cannot support its units in an extended fight. It has none of the

gadgetry.** The army relies on at least 7,000 volunteer fighters under
different commands, some entirely privately funded by oligarchs, others
based around far-right political beliefs. How will the US ensure that
weapons supplied do not go to Ihor Kolomoisky's privately funded Dnipro
battalion, or that we will not see the Azov battalion driving around
with its swastika-like Wolfsangel painted on American armored vehicles?
**The proposition seems even more dubious considering the number of
tanks, rocket launchers, and armored personnel carriers that Ukrainian
troops abandoned on the battlefield, to which pro-Russian separatists
helped themselves**. It's an uncomfortable echo of Islamic State
fighters driving around northern Iraq in American vehicles. Even when
these weapons are in the right hands, Ukraine's anti-terrorist operation
is more like Russia's early wars in Chechnya than a methodical
counterinsurgency campaign. The US may turn a blind eye to such actions,
as it often did during Russia's second Chechen war, but being a party to
them is something altogether different.]{.underline} Finally, proposing
to send Ukraine an arsenal is a misreading of why it lost this conflict
in the first place. Ukraine has no shortage of weapons, at least to take
on the separatists. Even though a lot of its equipment broke down and
was abandoned in combat, Ukraine's army was gaining ground against the
rebels until Russia decided to overtly invade in late August. At that
point, no amount of extra battery radars or night vision goggles were
going to change the balance of power. The US would achieve far more, and
risk much less, just taking the \$350 million authorized for weapons and
giving it to Ukraine to buy food and winter supplies for its forces.
[More arms will only exacerbate its confrontation with Russia, as well
as giving credence to Moscow's media campaign portraying Ukraine as a
puppet and client state of the West.]{.underline} On that score, the US
should learn from its mistakes in Georgia. After the Rose Revolution in
2004, Georgia's inexperienced new leadership, buoyed by Western training
and military aid, was lulled into believing it could prevail in a
conflict against Russia. In 2008, Russia's military---more antiquated
and poorly trained than it is today---crushed the Georgian army in a few
days. It then drove away much of the modernized equipment Georgia had
purchased, and destroyed a lot of the rest. After Ukraine's corrupt
officials are purged and replaced with young reformists, the leadership
will probably mirror that of Georgia: Ideal for transforming the
country, much less so for taking it to war. So instead of arms or other
advanced equipment, the US should work with Ukraine to make its armed
forces smaller and more effective. That will take years. Ukraine can get
parts from friendly neighbors to put its existing hardware back into
action. Meanwhile the US should impress upon Kyiv private armies and
volunteer units are a symptom of the military's failure, not a solution
for it. [Ultimately what Ukraine needs is money, and an economy that can
sustain its military. That is where the US has done the
least.]{.underline} Eugene Rumer commented in September that "US aid
since the start of the crisis last year has fallen way short of the
rhetoric." Helping the economy will prove much tougher than reflexively
loading weapons onto a ship, but if the economy rights itself, the
military will follow.

In Ukraine, elections are not the only way to transfer power. In fact,
elections have often been rigged farces, fomenting frustration among
Ukrainians at their inability to change the system. This [frustration
**generates revolutions**, the other method of transferring power in the
troubled post-Soviet state. Through revolutions, activists have now
twice overruled voters whom they suggest don't deserve the franchise
because they are "pro-Russian" or "anti-Ukrainian."]{.underline} Elected

demands that animated protests in 2014 remain.]{.underline} Calls for
electoral reform, the constitutional right to impeach the president, an
end to immunity from prosecution enjoyed by members of parliament and
some appointed officials, and the creation of independent anticorruption
bodies went unheeded until the very last days of Poroshenko's 2019
reelection campaign, when he began scrambling to make good on the
promises he made to Maidan that got him elected.[Despite those
revolutions' pro-Western and democratic reputations, both were tainted
by marginal neo-Nazi elements that the pro-Western lobby has convinced
Euro-Atlantic leaders are atypical of Ukraine or fake]{.underline}. [But
**nationalists still take credit for leading the violence** that

nationalists have already started laying the groundwork for a powerful
anti-Russia, anti-Zelenskiy narrative to take hold after the election.
In the final week of campaigning before the second round of voting,
speaker of parliament and far-right activist Andriy [Parubiy issued a
call to patriotic citizens on social media to
mobilize](https://twitter.com/AndriyParubiy/status/1117355190414389249) and
defend Ukraine from the pro-Russian revanche. State historian
Volodymyr [Vyatrovych made a similar
statement](https://twitter.com/viatrovych/status/1117402906809065472) that
Zelenskiy has lost despite how the voting goes because Ukraine's passive
majority are just observers, the activist minority will never support
him, and it's that minority which drives social change. With the
likelihood of Zelenskiy crushing Poroshenko in this election, and the
West increasingly bent on countering Russian influence in contested
spaces, Western allies must pay closer attention to how they support
democracy in Ukraine, lest they inadvertently succor far-right
nationalists[. A nationalist backlash against a Zelenskiy victory would
only bolster the dangerous Russian narrative that Ukrainians are
hopelessly divided and the country should be split up.National

[Nationalists want a strong central state, free of foreign interference:
"[The state is greater than class or
party](http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2013/06/28/127808/)." They
are proud to uphold the [permanent
revolution](http://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Grzegorz-Rossolinski-Liebe-on-The-Ukrainian-National-Revolution-of-1941.pdf) dogma
of Dmytro Dontsov and Mykola Stsyborsky, 1920s **fascists now lionized
as fathers of the [national
idea](https://www.pravda.com.ua/columns/2010/02/6/4714492/)**]{.underline}.
Stsyborsky's
book [Naziocracy](http://www.naso.org.ua/main/830-nacokratya-mikoli-scborskogo.html)
defines a meritocratic racism in which [only the most patriotic,
activist citizens of the ethnic majority may vote -- a theme echoed by
today's social-nationalism. Adherents of this ideology,
like [anti-Bolshevik national hero and SS trainer Stepan
Bandera](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892820,00.html),
collaborated with the Nazis. It's easy for enemies like Russia to point
to this **ethno-fascist rhetoric to undermine the validity of the
Ukrainian national project**.Nationalist militias volunteer to suppress
pro-Russian separatists because the government does not]{.underline}.
This leads to a perception [that they are Robin Hoods out to right
injustice. Far-right activists who join the state gain a veneer of
patriotism that obscures their previous illiberal
affinities]{.underline}. [They have thus **infiltrated their extremism
into Ukraine's power structures**, civil society, and elected government
by wrapping it in the flag, coopting protests, and committing themselves
to a long march through the state's institutions.]{.underline}Former
U.S. ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt said in 2014, "[Svoboda has proven its
democratic bona
fides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/ukraine-uprising-fascist-coup-grassroots-movement)."
But only 15 years earlier in the first issue of [their
newsletter Orientyry](https://archivar-ua.livejournal.com/photo/album/2395/),
chief editor Parubiy wrote, "[the Ukrainian nation rejects ideological
traps of communism and democratic liberalism and will return to
life-giving principles that inspired the great Aryan
civilization]{.underline}."
This [social-nationalist](https://mykharkov.info/news/belyj-vozhd-chem-zarekomendoval-sebya-v-harkove-komandir-azova-andrej-biletskij-93484.html) message
is potent to impoverished youth in remote regions. It inspires pride
that they are not Asian like Russians, but actually the ancient
Caucasian root race mythologized by racists -- proud Slavic
Aryan [descendants of elder
tribes](https://ukrainianweek.com/History/88577) like the Trypillians,
Amazons, Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, Vikings, and Cossacks.Were
Ukraine not a place [where the Holocaust
happened](https://www.jpost.com/Magazine/One-Ukraine-two-Jews-577695),
such views might be tabloid curiosities. But paired with theories of the
country's occupation by pro-Russian oligarchs who are often not
ethnically Ukrainian, these narratives are redolent of
Judeo-Bolshevism.To be sure, [anti-Semitism is at relatively lower
levels](https://ukrainianjewishencounter.org/en/who-benefits-from-myths-about-the-second-world-war/) today.
Moreover, [250,000 Jews remain in
Ukraine](https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/282575/jews-center-stage-in-ukraine-elections)
and the prime minister, leading oligarchs, and potential next president
are all Jewish. Still, [right-wing hostility toward Jews has deep roots
-- Ukraine is, after all, a land that's
seen [pogroms](https://ukrainianjewishencounter.org/en/between-the-whites-and-the-reds-who-carried-out-pogroms-against-the-jews-during-the-civil-war/) and
the Holocaust]{.underline}. As a result, the majority of the country's
Jews left in multiple waves from the late 1800s through the 1990s.
Progress has been made, but it's important not to let that progress
obscure the long history of deep hostility towards its Jewish minority
-- a history that's impossible to separate from today's anti-Russian,
nationalist movement, and one that will become even more important if
Zelenskiy prevails.The nationalists' sub-state and extra-parliamentary
power is shocking. [Ukrainian sociologist Dr. Volodymyr [Ishchenko's
statistical analysis of 60,000 protest
events](https://voxukraine.org/en/denial-of-the-obvious-far-right-in-maidan-protests-and-their-danger-today/) during
the period of Yanukovych and Maidan strongly indicates that the [far
right was the most prevalent collective
agent](https://cslr.org.ua/en/the-far-right-are-still-the-most-visible-political-forces/)]{.underline},
just as they claim. Many say they are just waiting for the signal to
finish the revolution. Some note that according to special operation
forces doctrine, **[it only takes five percent of a population
to [overthrow the
government](https://fpc.org.uk/the-unique-extra-parliamentary-power-of-ukrainian-radical-nationalists-is-a-threat-to-the-political-regime-and-minorities/),
which they point out they have already done once.]{.underline}**Veterans
official Vyacheslav Marchenko told me last year that [tens of
**thousands of nationalists train at camps** around the country, working
to counter Ukraine's supposed occupation with weapons looted from
government arsenals during the last revolution, as well as trophy guns
removed from the war zone]{.underline}. Right Sector leader Andriy
Tarasenko told me around the same time [that **50,000 Ukrainians
attend vyshkoly militia camps**]{.underline}, though this is likely a
high estimate as it is in revolutionaries' interest to exaggerate their
own reputation. Tarasenko has long been a weekend warrior in one of
independent Ukraine's oldest nationalist militias, Stepan Bandera's
Trident. University of Glasgow scholar Huseyn [[Aliyev estimated that
the militias number
30,000](http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/151638/).]{.underline}To grasp why
these groups are able to have such an impact, it's important to
understand Ukrainian society and attitudes towards institutions. Ukraine
is a multi-ethnic country with tolerant voters, but they place a lot of
trust in volunteers -- which empowers fringe politics by marginal actors
operating largely on their own. The ability of powerful officials to act
individually should not be underestimated. [Azov leader Biletskiy
even [threatened to overthrow the government again from the floor of
parliament in 2017](https://youtu.be/Xma2UwUHpsY).]{.underline}When I
suggested to a far-right member of Ukraine's secret police that
social-nationalism might be a Kremlin plot to sully Ukraine's
reputation, he responded that right-wingers actually count on such
skepticism: "If the West won't even believe us when we say it ourselves,
then we can get away with anything. They won't believe you either,
man."Most in the West think of Ukraine as a petri dish for Russian
hybrid warfare. But it's also a place where [Holocaust distortion and
white nationalism have been successfully normalized. It's quintessential
far-right white supremacy: threatening to disrupt democratic processes
that are too liberal, pseudo-science about Aryans, and positing that
Holocaust collaborators can be heroes too because they were also
anti-communist freedom fighters.]{.underline}The West should not put
itself in a position where it has to defend these ideas, and it
certainly should not be giving democracy assistance to their proponents.
**[Ukrainian nationalists have long exploited the West's democratic
goodwill]{.underline}**. Western allies ignore this because the
nationalists are still politically useful in the same way their
ancestors were during the Cold War. Indeed, by the late 1940s,
nationalists were already adept at a rebranding process
dubbed [democratization](http://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Grzegorz-Rossolinski-Liebe-on-The-Ukrainian-National-Revolution-of-1941.pdf) to
distance themselves from erstwhile Third Reich allies and normalize
ethnic Ukrainian nationalism.Democracies must wake up to this old
illiberalism rearing its head once again in countries seeking to
rehabilitate historical amnesia about fascist legacies. In Ukraine, this
means condemning far-right groups until they publicly disavow extremism
and hate speech.Denouncing neo-Nazis and Holocaust collaborators should
be easy. Anything else plays into [Russian plans to make Ukraine look
fascist](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/world/europe/russia-kim-philby-spy-defector.html);
why enable that? Ukraine and its Western allies ought to delegitimize
this compromising narrative instead of staying silent, which makes the
West look complicit and is [textbook reflexive
control](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328562833_Russian_Reflexive_Control).
It's exactly what Russia wants; and part of the reason that
transnational, sub-state nationalist, and white supremacist groups
suddenly feel emboldened again all over the world.[Nationalists have
long exploited the West's anti-Russia and anti-communist bent to push
illiberally in the other direction]{.underline}. As Ukraine moves to
select a new leader, the West needs to beware of falling into the same
trap again. Anti-democratic attempts to prevent a Zelenskiy presidency
play into this broader effort, and the implications for Ukrainian unity
and democracy are troubling: If millions of voters prefer Zelenskiy's
message and the nationalists' response is to attack the opposition, it
will lend more credence than Kremlin propaganda ever could to the
Russian narrative that [Ukraine's internal divisions are
irreconcilable.]{.underline}

Russia responded by annexing Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and backing
separatists in the east, moves that drew sanctions from the west.
Thousands of Ukrainian nationalists then headed to the east, forming
volunteer battalions that served as a vanguard for the Ukrainian forces
in the rebel regions.[Since then, the influence of nationalist groups
has steadily grown, driven by public dismay over the country's economic
woes and rampant corruption. Mostly teenage members of the ultra-right
groups have followed the guidance of war veterans, practising martial
arts and learning how to handle weapons. **The number of
ultranationalists is estimated at about 10,000, and they can quickly
take thousands to the streets and resort to violence.**]{.underline}

**assaulted gatherings by LGBT and women's rights activists,** attacked
Roma encampments around the country, derailed a lecture on the history
of the Holocaust and brawled with pro-Russia veterans. The ultra-right
groups also have a strict, military-style structure, and many of their
members have battlefield experience from years of fighting in the
east.]{.underline}Yermolayev said in the past the government turned a
blind eye to the rise of nationalist groups, using them as a scare
tactic, but now the ultra-right has turned on the authorities. "[The

criticised the Ukrainian government for failing to track down and punish
those responsible for the acts of violence and

ultranationalists, but has taken no action. The interior minister, Arsen
Avakov, said the rightwing organisations will be stopped. "They all know
it very well," he said. "And \... there will be no amnesty for
them."[Miroslav Mareš, an expert on rightwing extremist groups at Brno

to ultranationalist forces

have good relations to some neo-Nazi groupings in central and eastern
Europe]{.underline}**," Mareš said. [He added that early in the conflict
in eastern Ukraine, some members of Europe's neo-Nazi groups trained and
fought with the Azov battalion, a Ukrainian ultra-right paramilitary
group that advocated **white supremacist views**. The Ukrainian far
right also appears to have ties in other countries]{.underline}. The
Australian Brenton Tarrant, accused of slaughtering 50 people at two
mosques in the city of Christchurch in New Zealand, mentioned a visit to
Ukraine in his manifesto, and some reports alleged he had contacts with
the ultra-right. Yermolayev, the political analyst, noted that a violent
image projected by Ukrainian nationalists could serve as an argument for
those in the European Union who are reluctant about putting Ukraine on a
membership track any time soon. "How can you integrate a country plagued
not only by corruption but also nationalism?" he said.

[Ukraine has long been a country associated with human trafficking and
the sexual exploitation of women, but recent reports of human
trafficking as a consequence of the **war in eastern Ukraine** have
brought a new urgency to this ongoing crisis. News articles tell
chilling stories about [slave labor

and [child

and the problem has become so acute that the Ukrainian parliament's
[Equal Opportunities
Caucus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz2OcNSofN1uQm9YUVdGdEdHaWM/view)
issued a statement asking the United Nations, European Union, and
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate and prosecute the individuals
responsible for these crimes. [The rise in human trafficking in conflict
and post-conflict situations has been well documented in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}, specifically in the Balkans, Chechnya, and
Transdniestria, as well as in more recent conflicts such as those
occurring in Iraq and Syria. [In Ukraine, war, displacement, and the
economic crisis have led to an increase in the number of people
susceptible to human trafficking; [21 percent of the population is now
considered
vulnerable](http://www.iom.org.ua/sites/default/files/pres_gfk_iom2015_ukraine_eng_fin_3_2.pdf).
Within Ukraine, there are [1.7 million internally displaced people
(IDPs)](http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNICEF%20Ukraine%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20%23%2049.pdf),
and [1.4 million people have fled to neighboring
countries](http://reliefweb.int/map/ukraine/ukraine-overview-population-displacement-21-august-2015)
since the conflict began in 2014. The unprecedented number of IDPs,
migrants, and asylum seekers, coupled with economic depression, has
created an **environment ripe for human trafficking**. Evidence has been
reported of the use of child soldiers in combat by rebel forces, as well
as the [forced recruitment of men and
boys](http://stoptrafficking.org/sites/default/files/mom/documents/CT_situation%20analysis%20DEC%202015%20ENG_0.pdf)
for their use in the armed conflict. There have also been reports that
women and girls have been kidnapped for the purposes of [sex and labor
trafficking by the anti-government
forces](http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2015/243556.htm).
The latest report revealed that 5,000 prisoners in the self-declared
Luhansk People\'s Republic are subjected to [slave labor reminiscent of
the
gulag](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37512356?ocid=socialflow_twitter),
while an additional report is set to be released next month with similar
stories of slave labor from the self-declared Donetsk People\'s
Republic.]{.underline} The Global Slavery Index estimates that
[approximately [210,400 Ukrainians are enslaved
today](http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/index/), a twofold increase
over pre-war estimates]{.underline}. In a report listing the prevalence
of modern slavery in 160 countries, [Ukraine]{.underline} jumped from
86th place in 2013 to 25th place in 2016. The [country is categorized as
a source, transit, and destination country for human trafficking of men,
women, and children for use in [forced labor and sex
trafficking](http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258885.htm)]{.underline};
according to the International Organization for Migration, Ukraine
remains [one of the main countries of origin for victims of
traﬃcking](https://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/shared/shared/mainsite/activities/countries/docs/Ukraine/Migration-in-Ukraine-Facts-and-Figures.pdf).
Forced labor is still the most prevalent form of human trafficking, as
it was prior to the crisis, but victims' assistance statistics show a
shift in identified victims [from majority male to majority
female](http://iom.org.ua/sites/default/files/iom_vot_statistics_eng_jun2016.pdf),
indicating the [deep impact of the war on
women](http://stoptrafficking.org/sites/default/files/mom/documents/CT_situation%20analysis%20DEC%202015%20ENG_0.pdf).
[Despite Ukrainians' increased vulnerability, the number of reported
trafficking victims is down by 18 percent compared to the period before
the war]{.underline}, due to attention and resources currently being
directed to more pressing issues, [such as the war and the country's
IDPs](http://stoptrafficking.org/sites/default/files/mom/documents/CT_situation%20analysis%20DEC%202015%20ENG_0.pdf).
Human trafficking is a fluid occurrence that does not produce victims
immediately after the push factors that enable it to happen.
Consequently, there is often a lag of two years between when economic
crises or conflicts occur and when victims begin to appear. The Ministry
of Social Policy is the national coordinator for anti-trafficking work
in Ukraine, but this ministry is also the lead agency focused on the IDP
crisis and has been overwhelmed by the registration process. As a
result, [the focus on trafficking victims has dwindled]{.underline}.
Since the revolution, there have also been changes within the
bureaucracy, as supporters of the new regime were appointed to positions
and anyone associated with the previous regime was replaced.
Consequently, there is a new head of the Department on Family, Gender
Issues, and Counter-Trafficking at the Ministry of Social Policy. [The
new government representatives appear to be more open to working with
NGOs than the previous regime, but less progress has been made on
legislation---it took ten months to adopt the new state program on
trafficking, for example---and they seem to be less efficient in
responding to these new aspects of trafficking]{.underline}. However,
given the already-high frequency of human trafficking in Ukraine before
the war, it is imperative that steps are taken to prevent this
phenomenon in both government and non-government controlled areas of
Ukraine before it gets out of control. The Ukrainian government needs to
take the lead and diverge from its previous counter-trafficking
strategy, which only focused on human trafficking when it needed to
satisfy international agreements. The government should do more to
support human trafficking NGOs in Ukraine; with support from
international donors, they have been on the front lines since the late
1990s. [Ukrainian NGOs have repeatedly demonstrated their [ability to
pick up the
slack](http://www.budrich-journals.de/index.php/feminapolitica/index)
when the government is unable or unwilling to respond. NGOs were on the
ground when the conflict started and were the first to respond with
assistance]{.underline}. Although many had limited capacity and
finances, they worked to help displaced people through an established
anti-trafficking NGO network, local contacts, and social media.
Anti-trafficking NGOs expanded their missions, utilizing contacts around
the country by relying on their knowledge of the Donbas and Crimea
regions to help facilitate international assistance and referrals to
other organizations. [The Ukrainian government could learn from these
innovations and adapt more effectively to changes in human trafficking
dynamics; that is the only way to combat this crime. Officials need to
take advantage of existing laws by prosecuting traffickers, and the
government can also provide sustainable assistance to NGOs that have
relied on international funding to support victims'
rehabilitation]{.underline}. [Finally, they can address trafficking head
on and view it **as [directly related to the war in the
Donbas](http://www.caritas.org/2015/06/human-trafficking-in-crisis-situations/),
and not just a side effect of conflict**]{.underline}. The government
needs to stop viewing trafficking as a byproduct of the war and
something that can be put off until later; otherwise the problem will
spiral out of control and these egregious stories will be become
commonplace.

#### Human trafficking collapses the global economy

[Productivity resulting from individual agency and economic gain is a
key to national and global economic growth. Human trafficking tears
apart the structure of local economies, adds to the bureaucratic and law
enforcement burden at all levels of government, and destroys people's
lives.]{.underline} It leads to increased crime and immigration
problems, decreased safety for vulnerable populations, and decreased
welfare for nations ([Bertone,
2000](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b12)).
[**Human trafficking affects the global economy** as source countries
lose part of their labour supplies and transit and destination countries
deal with the costs of illegal immigration. Breakdowns in international
trade relations can occur when human trafficking becomes a bargaining
issue.]{.underline} Reducing the incidence of human trafficking must
therefore become a global response goal and a top priority of
communities, law enforcement, and policymakers. What needs to be done?
[Bales (2007:
19)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b6)
gives a list of anti‐trafficking policies including ending world
poverty, eradicating corruption, slowing the population explosion,
halting environmental destruction and armed conflicts, canceling
international debts, and getting governments to keep the promises they
make every time they pass a law. While this metamorphosis seems
unrealistic in the short term, economic analysis of the human
trafficking market points to initial steps needed at each level of
involvement. The research presented calls for a system of international
cooperation to decrease benefits to employers of using trafficked labour
to increase costs to traffickers of transporting vulnerable individuals,
and to lower the net benefit to persons for relocating illegally. Scarce
funding leads governments to focus resources on reducing the demand for
human trafficking which would in turn decrease both the price and
numbers of trafficked victims. [Because of the continuous supply of
vulnerable populations, international border issues, and crime
prevention obstacles, decreasing the supply of human trafficking is
economically less efficient, although vitally necessary]{.underline}. In
addition to the previous discussion of decreasing benefits to employers
of trafficked labour and increasing costs to human traffickers, there
are major areas that need to be strengthened to effectively decrease the
incidence of human trafficking. Other important steps are the global
cooperation needed to reduce human trafficking and the creation of a
concise and worldwide definition of human trafficking. Presently the
terminology of human trafficking, and hence reporting by regional,
national, and international entities, is imprecise and misleading. A
felony lacking definition cannot be controlled, nor can it be counted or
measured. The US TVPA leads the world in its definitions of human
trafficking and in its insightful responses to the criminal acts and
victimizations of human trafficking. The TVPA can be improved through
the inclusion of the knowledge gained through empirical studies. Only
with precise definitions can researchers begin to gather data and apply
empirical analysis. The human trafficking literature is almost entirely
anecdotal at this point in time. [Bales (2007:
231)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b6)
says the two major tools for fighting human trafficking are awareness
and resources. [Data collection and analysis are needed to facilitate
accurate information for law enforcement officials and those witnessing
human trafficking. There is a need for more information about the
methods of traffickers and structures of trafficking ([Aronowitz,
2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b2)).
It is also important to get information on trafficked individuals and
business practices from the users of trafficked services.]{.underline}
For example, one part of the UK plan of action against human trafficking
calls for raising awareness of men who frequent establishments where sex
trafficking is in operation. In deterring the demand for forced labour,
the UK action plan looks to the Gangmaster Licensing Authority and the
2006 Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act for criminal penalties
involving the employment and labour exploitation of illegal migrants.
Additionally, the UK Action Plan calls for specific measures when
dealing with trafficking victims who are children stating, "They have
very special needs, a reduced capacity to assess risk and an increased
dependence on others" (UK Action Plan, 2007: 31, 40, 60). [Decreasing
human trafficking requires both international and domestic solutions.
Nations (as well as individual states within the United States) should
create anti‐trafficking laws]{.underline} consistent with the TVPA. What
shall Europe do? Interstate and international law enforcement
coordination is needed to reduce human trafficking. Law enforcement
officers also need to improve their ability to identify and intervene in
human trafficking. [Schauer and Wheaton (2006:
166)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b51)
state, "Police must receive training in trafficking law enforcement, how
to identify trafficking, how to perceive the paradigm shift \[from
criminal to victim\], how to rescue victims and how to make contacts for
victim services, and how to deal with victims who may willingly serve as
witnesses in the prosecution of traffickers". Another issue, one
requiring a paradigm shift, is for nations and states to recognize that
persons who have been illegally trafficked are not themselves criminals.
Rather, trafficked persons are the victims of traffickers, of employers
of trafficked labour, and of end‐users of trafficked labour. With the
rapidly‐increasing anti‐immigration activism in first world countries
and the resultant rapid fortification of borders against illegal entry,
laws and law enforcement have tended to identify anyone who has entered
a country illegally as a criminal. The United National Office of Drugs
and Crime states, "Police and criminal justice staff needs standard
working procedures to guarantee the physical safety of victims, protect
their privacy and make it safe for them to testify against their
abusers" ([United National Office of Drugs and Crime,
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b55)).
Once realistic crime definitions are created, and once laws are created
that engage police at all levels in the enforcement of human trafficking
laws, policing agencies must give human trafficking highest enforcement
priority. [Human trafficking must receive high enforcement priority; for
without agency encouragement, human trafficking will be difficult to
identify and enforce. The seizure of the property of human traffickers
and employers of trafficked individuals would serve to not only
discourage the practice of human trafficking but also to push human
trafficking into a higher enforcement priority category as the proceeds
of asset forfeiture seizures would be applied to funding needs of
policing agencies]{.underline}. The United National Office of Drugs and
Crime states, "...successful convictions depend on the police and others
making the right decisions. This can only happen if they have the
knowledge and capacity to respond to human trafficking" ([United
National Office of Drugs and Crime,
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b55)).
[Historically and economically, prohibition has not decreased the trade
in illegal goods and services]{.underline}. [Bales (2005:
166)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b5)
suggests a better solution would be to increase workers' ability to
emigrate legally. Restrictions, he adds, push the trade underground,
where it is more violent and harder to discover. [Becker, et al. (2004:
31)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b9)
point out that the United States' prohibition on alcohol caused illegal
producers to replace legal ones. [Bales (2007:
2)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b6)
notes, "...making something illegal doesn't make it cease to exist;
making it illegal only causes it to vanish from view". Restricting
immigration therefore leads to increased revenue for traffickers. While
victim services are being made available to trafficking victims by
various social agencies under the provisions of the TVPA and UK Action
Plan, further research is necessary to identify the services required to
provide necessary help for victims of human trafficking. With faulty
definitions and cases being brought forward in small numbers and
piecemeal, many questions still exist about the availability and type of
victim's services required to meet the needs. Both law enforcement and
citizens of countries around the globe must be educated to understand
trafficking as the international crisis it has become. In Ending
Slavery: How we free today's slaves, Kevin [Bales (2007:
94)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b6)
presents several recommendations for community education and action
responses. He suggests that community groups and schools get information
about human trafficking (available at,
[http://www.freetheslaves.net](http://www.freetheslaves.net/)). In
addition, staff and volunteers of international organizations need
training to recognize warning signs of trafficking and the steps of
responding. Support is needed to provide the finances and recognition
needed to provide antislavery workers on the front lines with the
training in conflict resolution, community building, and victim services
to transform people from victims into productive wage earners. Funders
and funding agencies should be encouraged to work toward providing
stable funding for groups working on antislavery projects in the field.
Inter‐agency and inter‐organizational dialogue and cooperation would
also help in the fight against human trafficking. [When local
populations recognize human trafficking, the crime comes out of hiding
and effective responses can be created]{.underline}. If accurately
informed about the tactics of human traffickers (when documented and
published), persons considering relocating gain a more realistic view of
illegal migration and the perceived net benefit of illegally migrating
decreases. Effective deterrence of human trafficking means targeting
every stage of human trafficking involvement ([Bales, 2007:
31](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b6)),
with increased legal pressure placed upon the demand side predicted to
be most effective. Because freedom of choice and economic gain are at
the heart of productivity, human trafficking impedes national and
international economic growth. Within the next 10 years, crime experts
expect human trafficking to surpass drug and arms trafficking in its
incidence, cost to human well‐being, and profitability to criminals
([Schauer and Wheaton, 2006:
164--165](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b51)).
[The loss of agency from human trafficking as well as from modern
slavery is the result of human vulnerability]{.underline} ([Bales, 2000:
15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b3)).
As people become vulnerable to exploitation and businesses continually
seek the lowest‐cost labour sources, trafficking human beings generates
profit and a market for human trafficking is created. This paper
presents an economic model of human trafficking that encompasses all
known economic factors that affect human trafficking both across and
within national borders. We envision human trafficking as a
monopolistically competitive industry in which traffickers act as
intermediaries between vulnerable individuals and employers by supplying
differentiated products to employers. In the human trafficking market,
the consumers are employers of trafficked labour and the products are
human beings. Using a rational‐choice framework of human trafficking we
explain the social situations that shape relocation and working
decisions of vulnerable populations leading to human trafficking, the
impetus for being a trafficker, and the decisions by employers of
trafficked individuals. The goal of this paper is to provide a common
ground upon which policymakers and researchers can collaborate to
decrease the incidence of trafficking in humans. In this paper, the
supply in the market for human trafficking refers to labour provided by
individuals trafficked for both labour and commercial sexual
exploitation. [Economics models the labour supply decisions made by
vulnerable individuals. Thus the individual's decision of whether to
supply labour is of vital importance to the economic model]{.underline}.
Whether the outcome of the individual's choice in the human trafficking
market is labour or sexual exploitation is of importance for policy
determination, but does not change the economic model. One term needing
clarification is "agency". This term has been much discussed and debated
in the literature of trafficking: In his book, Good News About
Injustice, Gary Haugen speaks of agency in broad terms when he states,
"Injustice occurs when power is misused to take from others . . .
namely, their life, dignity, liberty or the fruits of their . . . labor"
(1998: 72). This agency debate is hotly contested, especially so in the
ideologically polarized sex trafficking discourse ([Farley,
2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b24);
[Raymond,
2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b46);
[Doezema,
1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b20);
and [Kempadoo,
2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b37)).
The question of agency is a question of the relative amount of personal
decisionmaking ability a trafficking victim retains. It is assumed that
some personal agency is limited when a person is trafficked. This loss
of agency by the victim is noted by the language of both the UN Protocol
in its statement, "having control over another person" ([UN Protocol,
2000:
3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b54));
and by the TVPA, in Article 3, paragraph (a), using the words "induced
to perform", and in subparagraph (B) "for the purpose of subjection to
involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery" ([OVAW, 2000:
5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b44)).
Decreasing the incidence of human trafficking requires collaboration
across professional fields to discover and handle limited agency.
Examples of this include law enforcement that deals with coercion by
traffickers during transportation, infractions of immigration law, and
the use of exploited labour. Some criminal justice studies focus on
prostitution and illegal immigration (some of which is trafficked).
Sociological research makes legislation more effective for different
countries and situations as it increases the knowledge of cultural norms
and responses. [Economics complements the law enforcement, criminal
justice, and sociology research and practices by analyzing the choices
individuals and organizations make in the human trafficking
market.]{.underline} The inclusion of the emotional (psychic) costs of
criminal behavior ([Hellman and Apler, 2006:
2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2435.2009.00592.x#b29))
connects economics with criminology and the other social sciences.
Economic models are useful for the modeling of labour markets, and thus
the market for human trafficking created by the supply and demand of
exploitable labour. Economic models are by necessity based on
assumptions. Variables such as cultural norms, corruption, and household
time allocation among individual family members can be difficult to
model. Because an economic model is a simplification of reality, the
exclusion of certain determinants from the model may not fully explain
the human trafficking market in its complexity. [The model will,
however, provide a general guideline for informing policymaking
decisions. An economic market is a place (physical or virtual) that
connects buyers ("demand") and sellers ("supply") either directly or
through an intermediary. A main theme in the human trafficking
literature is the role of intermediaries in connecting employers (the
source of "labour demand") needing compliant labour with vulnerable
individuals seeking employment]{.underline}. The market for trafficked
people involves labour supply decisions by vulnerable populations
(possibly migrants), labour demand decisions by employers, and the
intermediary decisions by human traffickers. This paper discusses the
decisions of these groups. [We model human trafficking as a
monopolistically competitive industry with many sellers (human
traffickers) offering many buyers (employers) differentiated products
(vulnerable individuals) based on price and preferences of the
individual employers.]{.underline}

### Ukraine Nuclear Capabilities

#### Ukraine has the ability and desire for nuclear proliferation

The former [Ukrainian]{.underline} envoy to NATO, Major General Petro
Garashchuk, recently stated in an interview with [Obozrevatel
TV](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&prev=_t&sl=it&tl=en&u=https://www.obozrevatel.com/crime/myi-nichego-ne-boimsya-diplomat-rasskazal-o-yadernom-oruzhii-ukrainyi.htm):
"I\'ll say it once more. We [have the ability to develop and
produce]{.underline} our own [nuclear weapons]{.underline}, currently
available in the world, such as the one that was built in the former
USSR [and]{.underline} which is now in independent Ukraine, located in
the city of Dnipro (former Dnipropetrovsk) that can produce these kinds
of [intercontinental ballistic missiles]{.underline}. Neither the United
States, nor Russia, nor China have produced a missile named Satan ... At
the same time, [Ukraine does not have to worry about international
sanctions when creating these nuclear weapons]{.underline}.\" The issue
of nuclear weapons has always united the great powers, especially
following the signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The
decision to reduce the number of nuclear weapons towards the end of the
Cold War went hand in hand with the need to prevent the spread of such
weapons of mass destruction to other countries in the best interests of
humanity[. During the final stages of the Cold War, the scientific
community expended great effort on impressing upon the American and
Soviet leadership how a limited nuclear exchange would wipe out
humanity. Moscow and Washington thus began START (Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty) negotiations to reduce the risk of a nuclear winter.
Following the dissolution of the USSR, the Budapest Memorandum on
Security Assurances persuaded Ukraine to relinquish its nuclear weapons
and accede to the NPT in exchange for security assurances from its
signatories. **Ukraine has in recent years begun entertaining the
possibility of returning to the nuclear fold**]{.underline}, especially
in light of North Korea's recent actions. Kim Jong-un's lesson seems to
be that a nuclear deterrent remains the only way of guaranteeing
complete protection against a regional hegemon. The situation in
Ukraine, however, differs from that of North Korea, including in terms
of alliances and power relations. [Kiev's government came into power as
a result of a coup d'etat carried out by extremist nationalist elements
who seek their inspiration from Nazi collaborator Stepan
Bandera]{.underline}. The long arm of NATO has always been deeply
involved in the dark machinations that led to Poroshenko's ascendency to
the Ukrainian presidency. From a geopolitical point of view, NATO\'s
operation in Ukraine (instigating a civil war in the wake of a coup)
follows in the footsteps of what happened in Georgia. NATO tends to
organize countries with existing anti-Russia sentiments to channel their
Russophobia into concrete actions that aim to undermine Moscow. The war
in the Donbass is a prime example. However, [Ukraine has been unable to
subdue the rebels in the Donbass region, the conflict freezing into a
stalemate and the popularity of the Kiev government falling as the
population's quality of life experiences a precipitous
decline]{.underline}. The United States and the European Union have not
kept their promises, leaving Poroshenko desperate and tempted to resort
to provocations like the recent Kerch strait incident or such as those
that are apparently already in the works, as recently reported by the
DPR authorities. [The idea of Ukraine resuming its production of nuclear
weapons is currently being floated by minor figures, but it could take
hold in the coming months, especially if the conflict continues in its
frozen state and **Kiev becomes frustrated and desperate**]{.underline}.
The neoconservative wing of the American ruling elite, absolutely
committed to the destruction of the Russian Federation, could encourage
Kiev along this path, in spite of the incalculable risks involved. The
EU, on the other hand, would likely be terrified at the prospect, which
would also place it between a rock and a hard place. Kiev, on one side,
would be able to extract from the EU much needed economic assistance in
exchange for not going nuclear, while on the other side the neocons
would be irresponsibly egging the Ukrainians on. [Moscow, if faced with
such a possibility, would not just stand there.]{.underline} In spite of
Russia having good relations with North Korea, it did not seem too
excited at the prospect of having a nuclear-armed neighbor. With
Ukraine, the response would be much more severe. **[A nuclear-armed
Ukraine would be a red line for Moscow, just as Crimea and Sevastopol
were]{.underline}**. It is worth remembering the Russian president's
words when referring to the possibility of a NATO invasion of Crimea
during the 2014 coup: [\"We were ready to do it \[putting Russia\'s
nuclear arsenal on alert\]. Russian people live there, they are in
danger, we cannot leave them. It was not us who committed to coup, it
was the nationalists and people with extreme beliefs. I do not think
this is actually anyone\'s wish -- to turn it into a global
conflict.\"]{.underline} As Kiev stands on the precipice, it will be
good for the neocons, the neoliberals and their European lackeys to
consider the consequences of advising Kiev to jump or not. [Giving the
nuclear go-ahead to a Ukrainian leadership so unstable and detached from
reality may just be the spark that sets off Armageddon.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine authorized six new nuclear plants---it has the capacity to quickly build nuclear weapons

[Interruptions in natural gas supply from Russia in January 2006 sharply
focused attention on the need for greater energy security and the role
of nuclear power in achieving this]{.underline}. [A nuclear power
strategy involving building and commissioning 11 new reactors with total
capacity of 16.5 GWe (and 9 replacement units totaling 10.5 GWe) to more
than double nuclear capacity by 2030 was approved by the government in
2006 to enhance Ukraine\'s energy independence.]{.underline} Ukraine\'s
2006 strategy envisaged completing Khmelnitski 3&4, which were
respectively 75% and 28% complete when work stopped in 1990. Initially
it was expected that an international tender would open up the choice of
technology and in March 2008 Areva, Westinghouse and South Korean
suppliers were invited to bid on completing or replacing them, along
with Atomstroyexport and Skoda -- all involving pressurized water (PWR)
types. In the event only Atomstroyexport and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power
submitted bids, with the former being chosen to complete the
partially-built units. KHNP renewed its interest in the project in 2016
(see below). [The government announced in September 2008 that
construction of Khmelnitski 3&4 would resume in 2010 for completion in
2016 and 2017, these completion dates being reaffirmed in the mid-2011
energy policy update. An intergovernmental agreement with Russia on
completing the two units was signed in June 2010, and in February 2011 a
framework contract was signed for Atomstroyexport to complete them as
AES-92 plants with V-392B reactors similar to those already on the
site.]{.underline} Under the intergovernmental agreement, some 85% of
the estimated UAH 40 billion (€3.7 billion) project would be financed
through a Russian loan, with 15% funding coming from Ukraine. The loan
would be repaid within five years after the reactors went into service.
[In July 2012 the government confirmed the feasibility, costings and
timing of the project -- then \$4.9 billion total. The loan agreement
was expected to be finalized by the end of 2012. At the end of 2013 the
energy minister said that construction might resume in 2015. After the
annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014, the cabinet in July
reviewed the political situation with Russia, **affirmed the priority of
nuclear power,** and said that a Western-design reactor might be built
at South Ukraine, which had access from the sea for large equipment
delivery.]{.underline} In December 2014 the prime minister reaffirmed
the priority of completing the Khmelnitski 3&4 units by 2018 to meet
anticipated demand, although Energoatom said that the government was in
the process of revoking the intergovernmental agreement with Russia and
amending the corresponding domestic legislation for Khmelnitski
3&4construction by Atomstroyexport (now NIAEP-ASE). The energy ministry
was reported to want Skoda JS to take over the contract from
Atomstroyexport. However the foreign ministry initially opposed this due
to Skoda JS being owned by Russia's OMZ, and Energoatom appealed to the
president to resolve the matter. The cost for completing the two units
had been put at €3.7 billion including the first fuel load at €296
million. A Polish investor has offered finance of €1.48 billion in
return for electricity supply to Poland. In September 2015 parliament
voted to repeal the 2012 law on construction of the two units on the
basis of non-performance by Atomstroyexport. The government wanted Skoda
JS to take over the project, and Skoda was keen to do so. Energoatom has
signed an agreement with Barclays bank to finance completion of the
Khmelnitski 3&4units, and stresses that Skoda JS "operates by European
laws in spite of the fact that the Russian company is its shareholder."
Energoatom has dismissed Chinese expressions of interest[. In August
2016 Energoatom signed an agreement with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power
(KHNP), one objective of which is to cooperate on the completion of
Khmelnitski 3&4.]{.underline} An associated objective is to cooperate on
the Ukraine-EU \'energy bridge\' project, exporting power from
Khmelnitski 2 to Poland. In July 2017 Energoatom said that Skoda JS had
modified the design and would supply both engineering services as well
as many of the components for the two units, with overall 70% Ukrainian
content. [The two oldest units in Ukraine, Rovno 1&2, were to be
replaced as part of the 2006 nuclear power strategy. In 2018, however,
[Energoatom signed an
agreement](http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-MOU-sees-Holtec-SMR-160-for-Ukraine-0203187.html)
with Holtec International to replace them by 2030 with multiple SMR-160
units]{.underline}. It is intended that this will be a pilot project,
and will set up a manufacturing hub for these reactors. A high-voltage
transmission line connecting the Rostov nuclear power plant in Russia to
Crimea was to be put into operation in 2018. [Chigirin/Chyhyryn on the
Tyasmyn River in the Cherkassy Oblast in the centre of the country is
proposed as one site for a new nuclear plant. In June 2019 a consortium
between American company Holtec, Energoatom, and the State Scientific
and Technology Center announced that it is seeking to build **six
SMR-160s** at the country\'s Rivne nuclear power station
site.]{.underline}

Vladimir [Putin's war against Ukraine has now entered its sixth year.
This is not a frozen conflict. More than 10,000 Ukrainians have been
killed, and that number grows each week.]{.underline} And on Nov. 25 of
last year, the Kremlin leader escalated his war of aggression, and even
expanded it into a new domain by attacking and seizing three Ukrainian
naval vessels and detaining 24 Ukrainian sailors in violation of
international law. They remain Putin's captives. Finally, more than 100
days since that attack, the free world has begun to respond. I welcome
President Donald Trump's recent decision, along with our Canadian and
European allies, to impose additional sanctions on Russian officials.
This is a powerful first step. But it must not be the only step. [**The
free world must respond with urgency and strength --- not just to a
single attack, but to Putin's broader campaign to undermine Ukrainian
sovereignty and the free institutions the country seeks to join.**
Additional U.S. sanctions must be on the table to impose direct costs on
Putin and his henchmen. We should also work closely with the NATO
alliance to enhance our military presence and capabilities in the Black
Sea region. Most of all, the United States should develop a long-term
plan for security assistance to Ukraine]{.underline} --- a plan that
truly reflects the stakes of this conflict not just for Ukraine, but for
the United States. Last year, [Ukraine received its first lethal aid
from the United States thanks to the Trump administration's approval of
a sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles --- a critical step the Obama
administration refused to take despite bipartisan support in Congress.
The Trump administration also notified Congress in February that, for
the first time since its creation in 2015, funds for the Department of
Defense's Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative will be used to provide
lethal aid, including sniper rifles and shoulder-fired grenade
launchers. I commend the administration for these two "firsts." Now it's
time to increase funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,
as well as the State Department's security assistance programs. And a
larger share of this funding should go to support defensive lethal aid
that will make Ukraine a more difficult target for Putin's aggression.
After Putin's Black Sea attack, Ukraine's maritime capabilities must be
enhanced by accelerating acquisition of coastal defense radars, patrol
boats, coastal defense and anti-ship missiles and other systems. On the
ground, Ukraine needs more Javelins, other anti-tank weapons, electronic
warfare systems and advanced counterartillery radars. And in the air, we
should examine how to assist Ukraine in improving its air
defenses.]{.underline}

On April 30, the US Department of State confirmed to [Radio Free
Europe/Radio
Liberty](https://www.rferl.org/a/javelin-missile-delivery-ukraine-us-confirmed/29200588.html)
the delivery of Javelin antitank missile systems to Ukraine. This issue
has been long-standing: the Obama administration refused to send the
weapons to Kyiv, while President Donald Trump changed course. Some
experts warn that giving Ukraine lethal defensive weapons will only
enrage the Russians and escalate the war, while others, including
[Atlantic Council
experts](https://www.brookings.edu/research/preserving-ukraines-independence-resisting-russian-aggression-what-the-united-states-and-nato-must-do/),
have insisted that [arming Ukraine is the most effective way to change
the facts on the ground and force Russian President Vladimir Putin to
finally negotiate. In 2017, the US Congress approved a \$47 million
military-aid package that included 210 Javelin antitank missiles and
thirty-seven Javelin launchers, but the State Department refuses to say
how many weapons have been delivered.]{.underline} UkraineAlert asked
its experts the following: What difference will the arrival of the
Javelins make militarily and politically in the four-year conflict
between Russia and Ukraine? Is this a game-changer? Ian Brzezinski,
Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center on
International Security: [This delivery of Javelins is an operationally
and geopolitically significant demonstration of US determination to
support Ukraine, an action long overdue following Russia's 2014
invasion]{.underline}. [Javelins]{.underline} alone will not enable Kyiv
to force Russia out of Crimea and Donbas, but they [substantively
increase Ukraine's ability to impose costs on Russian forces. The
Javelins will also likely reanimate among Russian commanders
uncomfortable memories of the role that US shoulder-mounted Stinger
air-defense missiles played in forcing the Soviet Union's
retreat]{.underline} from Afghanistan in the late 1980s. In these ways,
the **[Javelins will help to deter further Russian seizures of Ukrainian
territory]{.underline}**. However, they need to be complemented with
additional military support to Ukraine, a more robust NATO posture in
Central Europe, and more aggressive economic sanctions against Russia if
Putin is to be convinced to end his occupation of Crimea and eastern
Ukraine. Finally, it\'s important to remember that Ukraine is paying for
these missiles. It would be far better if Ukraine reformed its defense
industry so that it could produce and sell anti-tank weapons itself,
rather than having to buy them from Western countries. The Russian
threat to Ukraine is not only in the Donbas, but also from a potential
massive ground invasion from Russia with the purpose to occupy all of
Ukraine. Therefore, the Obama administration failed to supply this and
other lethal weapon systems when it was necessary. These systems needed
to be airlifted and Ukrainian troops immediately trained to use them in
the spring and summer of 2014. The supply of these weapons may be
signaling to Russia that the United States is very slow and will not
respond with adequate strength and in a timely manner in the case of a
major engagement. Additionally, Ukraine has a massive military
industrial complex that is capable of producing its own small weapons,
including antitank missiles. The United States will be well advised to
share some of its military technology, and provide technical assistance
to modernize and boost production in Ukraine. Peter Dickinson,
Nonresident Fellow at the Atlantic Council and publisher of Business
Ukraine and Lviv Today magazines: The arrival of the US javelins is very
welcome news for Ukraine---especially [given all the skepticism and
cynicism surrounding earlier delivery delays.]{.underline} It is a
largely symbolic move that will not change the military realities on the
ground, but [it will certainly resonate loudly in the
Kremlin]{.underline}. [Supplying weapons to Ukraine is a major
escalation in America\'s support for Kyiv and is in direct defiance of
repeated Russian warnings that any such move would lead to fresh rounds
of bloodshed.]{.underline} This apparent willingness to call the
Kremlin\'s bluff reflects the shift in initiative away from Moscow as
Russia\'s limited options in eastern Ukraine become more and more
obvious. [First, Javelins are a very effective antitank weapon and its
supplies along with other assistance will make Ukraine stronger and
increase the costs of further Russian advance in eastern Ukraine.
Second, but no less important, is the political meaning of the delivery
of Javelins. It is a strong signal indicating the resoluteness of US
support to Ukraine, and it really matters. The delivery of the Javelins
should also serve as an example for other Western allies, opening the
door for further supplies of lethal defensive weapons to
Ukraine.]{.underline}

[Armchair strategists have come out of the woodwork to explain why it
would be a mistake for the United States to arm Ukraine.]{.underline}
They argue that Russia is stronger than Ukraine and can outmatch any
escalation, Moscow has a greater interest in Ukraine than Washington,
and Ukraine's government is corrupt and undeserving of such support.
[These arguments are based on hoary myths, outdated analyses, and an
incomplete understanding of Kremlin policy and American
interests.]{.underline} In "[Don't Arm
Ukraine](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/450140/arming-ukraine-bad-idea),"
Michael Brendan Dougherty claims that "Ukraine is a deeply divided
country," echoing the infamous CIA National Intelligence Estimate from
the 1990s that said Ukraine might split in two. But that prediction
proved false and, while differences between east and west Ukraine have
not disappeared, they have lessened considerably since 2014. Dougherty
wrongly asserts that "Russian-speaking Ukrainians see the United States
as complicit in overturning a democratic result in 2015." First, he
probably meant 2014, when President Viktor Yanukovych fled following
massive protests. Second, the vast majority of Ukrainians speak Russian
and the vast majority of Ukrainians welcomed Yanukovych's departure
after he either ordered or permitted the use of snipers against
demonstrators. It is true that the Kremlin is peddling the falsehood
that the United States was responsible for Yanukovych's ouster, but it
has gained little traction even in the parts of the country where
sympathy toward Moscow was once substantial. That sympathy is [much
reduced](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russia-still-in-denial-over-the-loss-of-ukraine)
because of the Kremlin's ongoing war in Ukraine. Dougherty observes that
"successive governments in Kyiv have turned out to be ineffective and/or
hopelessly corrupt." While there is much truth in this statement, it is
incomplete and ultimately misleading. Under Poroshenko, [reform in
Ukraine has been
impressive](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/reform-in-ukraine-surpassing-expectations-and-public-perceptions).
The government has cleaned up the banking sector, introduced a
transparent system for government procurement, and moved toward a
single, market price for natural gas. This last measure cleaned up the
country's most corrupt sector, removed its dependence on Russia for
natural gas, and reduced its budget deficit by 80 percent. While
corruption remains a major problem, the IMF and EBRD give Ukraine good
marks overall for reform, especially since these efforts are taking
place in the midst of a war. Former NSC Senior Director Charles Kupchan
[joins](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/08/07/why-giving-ukraine-lethal-weapons-would-be-a-massive-mistake/?utm_term=.833756ab55b6)
Dougherty in claiming that the United States has no major interests in
Ukraine. But as Secretary of Defense James Mattis has [pointed
out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/06/12/pentagon-chief-declares-north-korea-the-new-top-threat-to-u-s-security/?utm_term=.16fde4ca91ad),
Russia is "resurgent and more aggressive" and has placed the
"international order under assault." Moscow is the world's other nuclear
superpower with the second or third most powerful conventional military.
Russian President Vladimir Putin claims the right to intervene on behalf
of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers wherever they live and wants a
sphere of influence within the former Soviet Union, if not beyond. To
achieve these aims, he went to war with Georgia in 2008 and has been at
war with Ukraine since 2014. His ambitions go far beyond Ukraine. The
United States has a vital interest in keeping the peace in Europe, and a
vital interest in the strength and viability of NATO and the European
Union. The Kremlin seeks to weaken both institutions and the ties
binding the United States to Europe. [The most cost efficient way to
counter the Kremlin's revisionist policies is to increase the cost of
its aggression in Ukraine.]{.underline} Thanks to Congress, we are
raising the economic costs on Moscow through sanctions. But that is not
sufficient. [Another error in Dougherty's article is the suggestion that
the Russian public, like the Putin government, is "willing to lose
troops in battle." Kupchan shares this view, claiming that the master
public manipulator Putin "would hardly fold his hand if Russian
casualties were to increase." In fact, numerous polls by the Levada
Center, the premier Russian polling institution, show that Russians do
not want their soldiers fighting in Ukraine.]{.underline} For that
reason, Putin hides his casualties from the public. Providing defensive
arms to Ukraine---[specifically Javelin missiles that destroy
tanks---would make it harder for the Kremlin to conduct additional
offensives because it would mean more Russian casualties. Leonid
Bershidsky
[argues](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-01/sending-defensive-arms-to-ukraine-would-be-deadly)
that it is futile to send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine because Moscow
has 20,000 tanks and can always provide more. In addition, he asserts,
there have been few changes in territory around the contact line over
the past two years and, therefore, anti-tank weapons would be used in a
Ukrainian effort to take back the territories currently occupied by
Moscow. This is simply wrong. Ukrainians have fought the Kremlin to a
standstill, but there are casualties every day, and since the Minsk II
ceasefire, Moscow has taken hundreds of additional square kilometers of
Ukrainian territory. Providing anti-tank missiles will help deter Moscow
from taking more.]{.underline} Kupchan also claims that sending arms
would "cause a rift between the United States and its main European
allies." While Germany and France oppose the move, Chancellor Angela
Merkel has said and German officials have told me privately that if the
United States provided arms, they would still cooperate with Washington

guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity when it gave
up its nuclear weapons in 1994. [Providing defensive weapons to Ukraine
will]{.underline} honor that commitment and raise the cost of the war
for Moscow. Over time, that may [help persuade the Kremlin to withdraw
from the Donbas. Even if it does not, it will force Moscow to waste
additional resources in Ukraine and make them think twice about
challenging us in the Baltics, where our NATO commitments would compel
us to respond more forcefully. **Providing defensive weapons to Ukraine
actually decreases the odds of a dangerous US-Russian
confrontation**.]{.underline}

There is a new normal in America: our government may shut down, but our
wars continue. [Congress may not be able to pass a budget, but the U.S.
military can still launch commando raids in Libya and Somalia, the
Afghan War can still be prosecuted, Italy can be garrisoned by American
troops]{.underline} (putting the "empire" back in Rome), Africa can be
used as an imperial playground (as in the late nineteenth century
"scramble for Africa," but with the U.S. and China doing the scrambling
this time around), and [the military-industrial complex can still
dominate the world's **arms trade**. In the halls of Congress and the
Pentagon, it's business as usual, if your definition of "business" is
the power and profits you get from constantly preparing for and
prosecuting wars around the world. "War is a racket,"]{.underline}
General Smedley Butler famously declared in 1935, and even now it's hard
to disagree with a man who had two Congressional Medals of Honor to his
credit and was intimately familiar with American imperialism. War Is
Politics, Right? Once upon a time, as a serving officer in the U.S. Air
Force, I was taught that Carl von Clausewitz had defined war as a
continuation of politics by other means. This definition is, in fact, a
simplification of his classic and complex book, On War, written after
his experiences fighting Napoleon in the early nineteenth century. [The
idea of war as a continuation of politics is]{.underline} both
moderately interesting and [dangerously misleading: interesting because
it connects war to political processes and suggests that they should be
fought for political goals; misleading because it suggests that war is
essentially rational and so controllable.]{.underline} The fault here is
not Clausewitz's, but the American military's for misreading and
oversimplifying him. Perhaps another "Carl" might lend a hand when it
comes to helping Americans understand what war is really all about. I'm
referring to Karl Marx, who admired Clausewitz, notably for his idea
that combat is to war what a cash payment is to commerce. [However
seldom combat]{.underline} (or such payments) [may happen, they are the
culmination and so the ultimate arbiters of the process. War, in other
words, is settled by killing, a bloody transaction that echoes the
exploitative exchanges of capitalism.]{.underline} Marx found this idea
to be both suggestive and pregnant with meaning. So should we all.
Following Marx, [Americans ought to think about war]{.underline} not
just as an extreme exercise of politics, but also [as a continuation of
exploitative commerce by other means.]{.underline} Combat as commerce:
there's more in that than simple alliteration. [In the history of war,
such commercial transactions took many forms, whether as territory
conquered, spoils carted away, raw materials appropriated, or market
share gained**.**]{.underline} Consider American wars. [The War of
1812]{.underline} is sometimes portrayed as a minor dust-up with
Britain, involving the temporary occupation and burning of our capital,
but it really [was about crushing Indians on the frontier and grabbing
their land. The Mexican-American War was another land grab, this time
for the benefit of slaveholders. The Spanish-American War was a land
grab for]{.underline} those seeking [an American empire overseas, while
World War I was for making the world "safe for democracy"]{.underline}
--- [and]{.underline} for [American business interests
globally.]{.underline} Even World War II, a war necessary to stop Hitler
and Imperial Japan, witnessed the emergence of the U.S. as the arsenal
of democracy, the world's dominant power, and the new imperial stand-in
for a bankrupt British Empire. [Korea? Vietnam? Lots of profit for the
military-industrial complex and plenty of power for the Pentagon
establishment. Iraq, the Middle East, current adventures in Africa? Oil,
markets, natural resources, global dominance. In societal calamities
like war,]{.underline} there will always be winners and losers. But [the
clearest winners are often companies like Boeing and Dow Chemical, which
provided B-52 bombers and Agent Orange, respectively, to the U.S.
military in Vietnam. Such "arms merchants**"**]{.underline} --- an
older, more honest term than today's "defense contractor" --- [don't
have to pursue the hard sell, not when war and preparations for it have
become so permanently, inseparably intertwined with the American
economy, foreign policy, and our nation's identity as a rugged land of
"warriors" and "heroes"]{.underline} (more on that in a moment). War as
Disaster Capitalism Consider one more definition of war: not as politics
or even as commerce, but as societal catastrophe. Thinking this way, [we
can apply Naomi Klein's concepts of the "shock doctrine" and "disaster
capitalism**"**]{.underline} to it. [When such disasters occur, there
are **always** those who seek to turn a **profit**. Most Americans are,
however, discouraged from thinking about war this way]{.underline}
thanks to the power of what we call "patriotism" or, at an extreme,
"superpatriotism" when it applies to us, and the significantly more
negative "nationalism" or "ultra-nationalism" when it appears in other
countries. During wars, we're told to "support our troops," to wave the
flag, to put country first, to respect the patriotic ideal of selfless
service and redemptive sacrifice (even if all but 1% of us are never
expected to serve or sacrifice). We're discouraged from reflecting on
the uncomfortable fact that, as "our" troops sacrifice and suffer,
others in society are profiting big time. Such thoughts are considered
unseemly and unpatriotic. [Pay no attention to the war profiteers, who
pass as perfectly respectable companies. After all, any price is worth
paying]{.underline} (or profits worth offering up) [to contain the enemy
--- not so long ago, the red menace, but in the twenty-first century,
the murderous terrorist. Forever war is forever profitable. Think of the
Lockheed Martins of the world. In their commerce with the Pentagon, as
well as the militaries of other nations, they ultimately seek cash
payment for their weapons and a world in which such weaponry will be
eternally needed**.**]{.underline} In the pursuit of security or
victory, political leaders willingly pay their price. Call it a
Clausewitzian/Marxian feedback loop or the dialectic of Carl and Karl.
[It also represents the eternal marriage of combat and
commerce.]{.underline} If it doesn't catch all of what war is about, it
should at least remind us of the degree to which war as disaster
capitalism is driven by profit and power. For a synthesis, we need only
turn from Carl or Karl to Cal --- President Calvin Coolidge, that is.
"The business of America is business," he declared in the Roaring
Twenties. Almost a century later, [the business of America is war, even
if today's presidents are too polite to mention that the business is
booming.]{.underline} America's War Heroes as Commodities Many young
people today are, in fact, looking for a release from consumerism. In
seeking new identities, quite a few turn to the military. And it
provides. Recruits are hailed as warriors and warfighters, as heroes,
and not just within the military either, but by society at large. Yet in
joining the military and being celebrated for that act, our troops
paradoxically become yet another commodity, another consumable of the
state. Indeed, they become consumed by war and its violence. Their
compensation? To be packaged and marketed as the heroes of our
militarized moment. Steven Gardiner, a cultural anthropologist and U.S.
Army veteran, has written eloquently about what he calls the "heroic
masochism" of militarized settings and their allure for America's youth.
Put succinctly, in seeking to escape a consumerism that has lost its
meaning and find a release from dead-end jobs, many volunteers are
transformed into celebrants of violence, seekers and givers of pain, a
harsh reality Americans ignore as long as that violence is acted out
overseas against our enemies and local populations. Such "heroic"
identities, tied so closely to violence in war, often prove poorly
suited to peacetime settings. Frustration and demoralization devolve
into domestic violence and suicide. In an American society with ever
fewer meaningful peacetime jobs, exhibiting greater and greater
polarization of wealth and opportunity, the decisions of some veterans
to turn to or return to mind-numbing drugs of various sorts and
soul-stirring violence is tragically predictable. That it stems from
their exploitative commodification as so many heroic inflictors of
violence in our name is a reality most Americans are content to forget.
You May Not Be Interested in War, but War Is Interested in You As
Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky pithily observed, "You may not be
interested in war, but war is interested in you." [If war is combat and
commerce, calamity and commodity, it cannot be left to our political
leaders alone]{.underline} --- and certainly not to our generals. [When
it comes to war, however far from it we may seem to be, we're all in our
own ways customers and consumers.]{.underline} Some pay a high price.
Many pay a little. A few gain a lot. Keep an eye on those few and you'll
end up with a keener appreciation of what war is actually all about. No
wonder our leaders tell us not to worry our little heads about our wars
--- just support those troops, go shopping, and keep waving that flag.
If [patriotism is]{.underline} famously the last refuge of the
scoundrel, it's also [the first recourse of those seeking to mobilize
customers for the latest bloodletting exercise in combat as
commerce]{.underline}. Just remember: [in the grand bargain that is war,
it's their product and their profit.]{.underline} And that's no bargain
for America, or for that matter for the world.

[The tripling of US arms sales]{.underline} [abroad to a record \$66.3
billion is an accurate barometer of the accelerating drive to war in the
Persian Gulf and on a world scale. This one violently surging sector of
American exports reflects a diseased capitalist economy and society,
whose financial-corporate elite resorts to **militarism** as a means of
offsetting the overall economic decline of the United States. The annual
survey of global arms sales released this week by the Congressional
Research Service]{.underline} (CRS), the policy research arm of the US
Congress, [places the United States number one in the provision of
advanced weaponry to the world by an overwhelming margin.]{.underline}
"In 2011, the US led in arms transfer agreements worldwide, making
agreements valued at \$66.3 billion (77.7 percent of all such
agreements), an extraordinary increase from \$21.4 billion in 2010. The
US worldwide agreements total in 2011 is the largest for a single year
in the history of the US arms export program," according to the report
prepared for Congress. In an earlier period, Washington justified such
weapons deals as part of its Cold War strategy of countering the
influence of the Soviet Union and propping up regimes aligned with the
West against Moscow and its allies. This was under conditions where
Soviet arms sales to the so-called Third World rivaled and even
surpassed those of the United States. [Today]{.underline}, however, as
the CRS report makes clear, [the US accounts for more than three
quarters of global arms deals]{.underline}, with the share of its
closest competitor, Russia, amounting to just 5.6 percent. [The massive
rise in US arms sales is driven by the accelerating turn toward
aggressive war as a means of achieving the strategic global objectives
of US imperialism, combined with the insatiable drive for profit and
power by America's bloated military-industrial complex.]{.underline} The
lion's share of the rise in arms exports is directed to [Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates]{.underline} (UAE), which [together account
for \$38.2 billion of the \$66.3 billion total. The other major sales
were \$2 billion worth of antimissile batteries to
Taiwan]{.underline}---a provocative move aimed against China---[and
\$6.9 billion in arms to India]{.underline}, ratcheting up tensions with
its regional antagonist, Pakistan. The Saudi monarchy's purchase of 84
advanced F-15 fighter planes together with dozens of military
helicopters and other weapons yielded super profits for Boeing and
United Technologies. The regime in the UAE obtained a \$3.5 billion
sophisticated missile defense system, providing rich returns for
Lockheed Martin. The CRS report includes the observation: "[Whereas the
principal motivation for arms sales by key foreign suppliers in earlier
years might have been to support a foreign policy objective, today that
motivation may be based as much, if not more, on economic considerations
as those of foreign or national security policy."]{.underline} [In
reality, these foreign policy objectives and economic interests feed
each other. The military-industrial complex]{.underline} that the former
general Dwight D. Eisenhower warned against at the end of his presidency
a half-century ago [has grown to gargantuan proportions, dominating the
US government and both major parties and playing a grossly
disproportionate role in the American economy. It provides a powerful
impetus to both militarism abroad and the assault on democratic rights
at home. The purchases by the monarchical regimes in the Arab world
stem]{.underline}, on the one hand, from their reaction to the popular
upheavals that were dubbed the "Arab Spring" and, on the other, [from
the buildup by the US and its allies for another war]{.underline}, this
time against Iran. The House of Saud, which runs Saudi Arabia as a
family fiefdom, saw in the events in Tunisia, Egypt and particularly
Bahrain, where its troops were used to suppress mass protests, a mortal
threat to its absolutist rule. An essential part of its response is the
dramatic expansion of its military apparatus. [The buildup to war
against Iran, just as the one that preceded the war of aggression
against Iraq a decade ago, has been publicly justified as a response to
the supposed threat posed by "weapons of mass destruction."]{.underline}
The US and its allies have claimed that Iran's nuclear program is
directed at producing nuclear weapons, a charge repeatedly denied by the
government in Iran, which insists the program is for peaceful purposes.
[The hypocrisy of these charges against Iran, which have provided the
pretext for ~~crippling~~ sanctions, the deployment of a US air and sea
armada in the Persian Gulf, and threats by Israel and the US of an
unprovoked military assault, is evident in the figures provided by the
US arms sales report. The amount of weaponry Washington sold to the
Saudi and UAE regimes alone last year amounted to nearly six times
Iran's entire military budget.]{.underline} The US geo-strategic
objective in sponsoring these weapons sales is to create potently armed
regional proxies for a war for regime-change in Iran. This process is
already playing out in Syria, where Washington's major arms
customers---Saudi Arabia and the UAE---are openly sponsoring the
so-called rebels seeking the overthrow of Iran's principal Arab ally,
the government of Bashar al-Assad. [This sponsorship has extended to the
creation of a \$100 million fund to pay the salaries of the militias
challenging the Syrian government, as well as the provision of weapons,
which is being coordinated by the CIA in Turkey and undoubtedly on the
ground in Syria itself. The preparations for war against Iran are
directed at tightening US hegemony over the energy-rich regions of the
Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea, which the landmass of Iran
spans]{.underline}. In that sense, the aggression being prepared against
Iran and its people under Obama is in pursuit of the same aims that
underlay the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq launched under Bush. [The arms
industry is massively subsidized by the American taxpayer.]{.underline}
While the political establishment and media insist "there is no money"
when it comes to jobs, decent wages, education and vital public
services, [endless billions are lavished on America's merchants of
death. American working people neither share in this industry's
state-subsidized profits nor have any say over its sale of powerful
weapons systems to reactionary regimes. Just as mass opposition emerged
to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is similar popular hostility
to arming the Saudi and UAE monarchs to the teeth, not to mention being
dragged into yet another war, this time against Iran. The disappearance
of any mass protest against war is a reflection]{.underline} not of
popular sentiment, but rather [of the reactionary politics of a
privileged middle class layer of pseudo-lefts that deliberately worked
to channel anti-war sentiment behind Obama and the Democratic Party. A
new mass movement against war can be built only through an
irreconcilable break with the Democratic Party and the US two-party
system. What is required is the independent political mobilization of
the working class on the basis of a socialist program, including the
conversion of the arms industry into publicly owned facilities dedicated
to production for human needs rather than mass slaughter.]{.underline}

#### Trumps base loves the military -- fourth of July rally proves

[With U.S. fighter jets flying overhead, President Donald Trump praised
the military]{.underline} and reveled in a show of pomp and patriotism
on Thursday in a celebration of Independence Day that critics accused
him of turning into a political event. Trump, a Republican who was
inspired to stage the flashy affair after seeing a similar display in
France, dismissed concerns ahead of the ceremony about the expense and
militaristic overtones of the event outside the 97-year-old Lincoln
Memorial, a symbol of national unity. ["Our nation is stronger today
than it ever was before. It is its strongest now," Trump said from a
platform in front of the famous memorial, echoing a theme he uses at
campaign rallies.]{.underline} Flanked by Bradley fighting vehicles,
Trump otherwise steered clear of divisive political rhetoric, in a
departure from the majority of his speeches. At times, [an enthusiastic
crowd could be heard chanting: "USA! USA! USA!"]{.underline} Trump, 73,
praised American military might despite having himself avoided the draft
during the Vietnam War with bone spurs in his feet. With well-planned
choreography, he told stories about each military branch before
separate, dramatic flyovers of their respective military aircraft. ["We
celebrate our history, our people, and the heroes who proudly defend our
flag: the brave men and women of the United States military," Trump
said. "For over 65 years, no enemy Air Force has managed to kill a
single American soldier. Because the skies belong to the United States
of America."]{.underline} Not all the choreography appeared to go off as
planned. A flyover by Air Force One, which Trump had teased earlier in
the day on Twitter, occurred unannounced and without fanfare. But a low
and spectacular flyover by six F-18s known as the "Blue Angels" at the
conclusion of Trump's speech thrilled the crowd. Some people shouted
"Four More Years!" in support of the president. Trump paid tribute to
the U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, two
agencies that have played leading roles in carrying out his tough
immigration policies. He cited as great Americans both Harriet Tubman
and Frederick Douglass, African-Americans who campaigned for the
abolition of slavery more than 100 years ago. That praise could draw
criticism as Trump's administration in May decided to keep Tubman's
image off the \$20 bill. He previously raised doubts about his knowledge
of Douglass by speaking of the former slave in the present tense as
"somebody who's done an amazing job." [Earlier in the day thousands of
supporters wearing Trump's signature "Make America Great Again"
hats]{.underline}, along with opponents questioning the cost of the
event, [poured into the U.S. capital]{.underline} despite scorching
temperatures and intermittent rain, while a diapered "Baby Trump"
balloon sat next to a banner calling Trump a traitor. Protesters burned
a U.S. flag in front of the White House. Ahead of the speech, Democrats
accused the president of staging an out-of-place campaign rally, aware
he has a history of veering off script with sharp partisan attacks even
at events that are not meant to be overtly political. [Trump supporters
and opponents carried American flags and wore red, white and blue
outfits. "I think what Trump's doing with the tanks, all the flyovers, I
think it's great," said Brandon Lawrence, his face painted with the
colors of the American flag.]{.underline}
