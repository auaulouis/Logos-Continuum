WASHINGTON -- If President Donald Trump has a true political bromance
with any foreign leader, it\'s probably Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. Sure, Trump says he "fell in love" with North Korea's Kim
Jong Un, and he's clearly smitten with Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, the
"Trump of the Tropics." But [[the]{.mark} [bond]{.mark} [between]{.mark}
[Trump]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [Netanyahu]{.mark} goes far beyond political
flattery and good chemistry. [I]{.mark}t'[s]{.mark} also [great]{.mark}
[politics]{.mark} -- for both men -- as they each face re-election
battles]{.underline}. The two leaders met Monday at the White House,
where [[Trump]{.mark} signed an official proclamation
[recogniz]{.mark}ing [Israel\'s]{.mark} [sovereignty]{.mark} over the
Golan Heights]{.underline}, a disputed territory the United Nations
considers \"occupied\" by Israel. "Our relationship is powerful," Trump
declared of U.S.-Israeli ties. "You've always been there, including
today,\" Netanyahu responded, \"and I thank you." Monday\'s frothy
exchange spotlights the mutually beneficial politics of their
friendship. \"[Cut from the same political cloth, [Trump and Netanyahu

an expert on the Middle East and fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote
in a recent analysis. \"[Trump's benevolence toward Israel \... buoys
the prime minister's prospects]{.underline},\" he wrote. \"[And when he
responds gratefully by heaping praise on Trump, Netanyahu bolsters the
president's standing among his core Republican and evangelical
supporters]{.underline}.\"[[Trump enjoys high approval ratings in
Israel]{.mark}, and Netanyahu has made his close relationship with the
American president a centerpiece of his campaign]{.underline} before

showing him shaking hands with Trump and declaring \"Netanyahu, in a
different league.\"

#### US arms sales assure Israel -- Israeli military strength reliant on US arms sales- plan hurts assurances

TEL AVIV --- The Obama administration on Tuesday increased its efforts
to
ease [Israel](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/israel/index.html?inline=nyt-geo)'s
opposition to a possible nuclear deal with Iran, as the top [American
[military]{.mark}]{.underline} leader [[assured]{.mark} [Israeli]{.mark}
officials that [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[would]{.mark} further [strengthen]{.mark} [Israel's]{.mark}
[arsenal]{.mark} of arms, warplanes]{.underline} and cybertechnology.

Israeli military officials pressed Gen. [Martin E.
Dempsey](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/martin_e_dempsey/index.html?inline=nyt-per),
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to [expand the long-term
maintenance of Israel's "qualitative military edge"]{.underline} over
regional adversaries to include not just better weaponry but also more
weaponry and training for what could be a larger Israeli defense force.

The request reflected increased [anxiety in Israel]{.underline} not only
[over]{.underline} an international nuclear pact with Iran, but also
over [increased American supplies of arms to Arab
countries]{.underline}. While these countries mistrust Iran,
historically they also have been adversaries of Israel.

Even before meeting with General Dempsey on Tuesday, Defense Minister
Moshe Yaalon of Israel expressed concern that Washington's efforts to
supply advanced arms to reassure Arab allies worried about Iran could
eventually give Israel cause for concern.

"Even if there are not now any hostile designs against us, as we know in
the Middle East, intentions are liable to change," Mr. Yaalon said at a
security conference. "The capability will without a doubt be there, and
this must be prepared for."

For Israel, that preparation is taking the form of asking the Obama
administration for more of everything, from arms to training to
cybertechnology.

"[Israel wants to make sure that we're not just helping them on the
qualitative side]{.underline}," General Dempsey told reporters traveling
with him after his meetings. "It's the notion that [size
matters]{.underline}."

Military officials said that no specific new commitments had been made,
but that the [[Pentagon would continue to work with Israel to expand its
military]{.underline}]{.mark}.

General Dempsey said that Israel did not want just to "overmatch" Arab
states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates qualitatively.
"[They want to overmatch them in size as well,]{.underline}" he said.

At the moment, **[[assurance]{.mark} [of]{.mark} additional military
[aid]{.mark} [is]{.mark} about [the]{.mark} [only]{.mark} [thing]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [Israel]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [getting]{.mark} from the
United States]{.underline}**. Relations between the two countries have
been increasingly tense, as President Obama and Prime Minister [Benjamin
Netanyahu](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/benjamin_netanyahu/index.html?inline=nyt-per) remain
at odds over an Iran nuclear agreement and over what the White House
views as Israeli intransigence on the issue
of [Palestinian](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/palestinians/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier)
statehood.

Mr. Obama last week reiterated a warning to Israel that Mr. Netanyahu's
election campaigning against a Palestinian state earlier this year may
mean that the United States will agree to resolutions in the United
Nations that are anathema to Israel. One likely possibility raised by
White House officials would be a resolution embodying the principles of
a two-state solution that would include Israel's 1967 borders, with
mutually agreed swaps of territory with the future Palestine.

"If, in fact, there's no prospect of an actual peace process," Mr. Obama
said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2, "then it becomes more
difficult to argue with those who are concerned about settlement
construction, those who are concerned about the current situation. It's
more difficult for me to say to them, 'Be patient and wait.' "

The president said that nonetheless, his commitment to Israeli security
would remain, and General Dempsey's visit was in many ways meant to
reinforce that.

Israel is already helped by a law enacted by Congress in 2008 requiring
that [arms sales allow Israel to maintain a "qualitative military
edge]{.underline}" in the region. All sales to the Middle East are
evaluated based on how they will affect [Israeli military
superiority]{.underline}. But the Obama administration has also viewed
improving the militaries of the Gulf Arab states --- those that see Iran
as a threat in the region --- as critical to Israeli security.

Gen[eral Dempsey's trip is the second by a high-ranking American
official to **reassure Israel** in the past week]{.underline}. Last
week, [John O.
Brennan](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/john_o_brennan/index.html?inline=nyt-per),
the Central Intelligence Agency director, met with Mr. Netanyahu and
other officials.

General Dempsey said he had pointed out to Israeli defense officials
that Israel was way ahead of the Gulf Arabs in the race to receive
the [F-35 fighter
jet](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/m/military_aircraft/f35_airplane/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier),
considered the jewel of America's future arsenal. The plane, one of the
world's most expensive weapons projects, has not been marketed to Arab
allies of the United States.

"I reminded my counterparts that they are on the path to have the joint
strike fighter where others in the region are not," General Dempsey
said, using another term for the F-35.

#### U.S. alliance deters Israel first strike on Iran 

Chossudovsky, 06/14/19

(Michel Chossudovsky, Professor of Economics and founder of Center for
Research on Globalization, "Pre-emptive Nuclear War: The Role of Israel
in Triggering an Attack on Iran," Global Research,
<https://www.globalresearch.ca/pre-emptive-nuclear-war-role-israel-attack-iran/5677025>)
ZFO

[There has been much debate regarding the role of Israel in initiating
an attack against Iran.]{.underline}

[Israel is part of a military alliance. Tel Aviv is not a prime
mover]{.underline}. It does not have a separate and distinct military
agenda.

Israel is integrated into the "war plan for major combat operations"
against Iran formulated in 2006 by U.S. Strategic Command
(U.S.STRATCOM). [In the context of large scale military operations, an
uncoordinated unilateral military action by one coalition partner,
namely Israel, is from a military and strategic point almost an
impossibility. Israel is a de facto member of NATO. Any action by Israel
would require a "green light" from Washington.]{.underline}

An attack by Israel could, however, be used as "the trigger mechanism"
which would unleash an all-out war against Iran, as well as retaliation
by Iran directed against Israel.

In this regard, there are indications going back to the Bush
administration that Washington had indeed contemplated the option of an
initial (U.S. backed) attack by Israel rather than an outright U.S.-led
military operation directed against Iran. The Israeli attack --although
led in close liaison with the Pentagon and NATO-- would have been
presented to public opinion as a unilateral decision by Tel Aviv. It
would then have been used by Washington to justify, in the eyes of World
opinion, a military intervention of the U.S. and NATO with a view to
"defending Israel", rather than attacking Iran. Under existing military
cooperation agreements, both the U.S. and NATO would be "obligated" to
"defend Israel" against Iran and Syria.

It is worth noting, in this regard, that at the outset of Bush's second
term, (former) Vice President Dick Cheney had hinted, in no uncertain
terms, that Iran was "right at the top of the list" of the "rogue
enemies" of America, and that Israel would, so to speak, "be doing the
bombing for us", without U.S. military involvement and without us
putting pressure on them "to do it"8

[According to Cheney:]{.underline}

[One of the concerns people have is that Israel might do it without
being asked. ...Given the fact that Iran has a stated policy that their
objective is the destruction of Israel, [the Israelis might well decide
to act first, and let the rest of the world worry about cleaning up the
diplomatic mess afterwards]{.mark}]{.underline},9

Commenting the Vice President's assertion, former National Security
adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski in an interview on PBS, confirmed with some
apprehension, yes: Cheney wants Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to act on
America's behalf and "do it" for us:

Iran I think is more ambiguous. And there the issue is certainly not
tyranny; it's nuclear weapons. And the vice president today in a kind of
a strange parallel statement to this declaration of freedom hinted that
the Israelis may do it and in fact used language which sounds like a
justification or even an encouragement for the Israelis to do it.10

What we are dealing with is a process of joint U.S.-NATO-Israel military
planning. An operation to bomb Iran has been in the active planning
stage since 2004. Officials in the Defense Department, under Bush and
Obama, have been working assiduously with their Israeli military and
intelligence counterparts, carefully identifying targets inside Iran.
[[In]{.mark} [practical]{.mark} military [terms]{.mark}, [any]{.mark}
[action]{.mark} by Israel [would]{.mark} have to [be]{.mark}
[planned]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [coordinated]{.mark} at the highest levels
of the U.S. led coalition]{.underline}.

#### Iran-Israel War is existential 

**Trabanco**, 01/13/**09**(José Miguel Alonso Trabanco, Geopolitical
Monitor Writer, "The Middle Eastern Powder Keg Can Explode at Anytime,"
Global Research,
[**https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-middle-eastern-powder-keg-can-explode-at-anytime/11762**](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-middle-eastern-powder-keg-can-explode-at-anytime/11762))

Those Arab governments are afraid of Iran's using its proxies and allies
to fuel unrest and to topple them, thus advancing Teheran's agenda of
becoming a regional leader. [If those governments are
overthrown,]{.underline} their hypothetical successors will surely be
much less willing to collaborate with the West, which knows that, if
such thing ever happens, [the Middle Eastern balance of power would
dramatically change, not to mention that the price of oil would
skyrocket.]{.underline}

[Israel fears a nuclear Iran would mean the end of the Israeli monopoly
over nuclear weapons in the region]{.underline}. An Iran armed with
nuclear weapons (even if it is ruled by hardline Mahmud Ahmadinejad)
would not be foolish enough to attack Israel first because Teheran is
well aware of Israel's menacing stockpile of nuclear weapons.

So what [the Israeli government really is scared of is the possibility
that any rival of Israel, covered by a hypothetical Iranian nuclear
umbrella, would feel less intimidated by Israel]{.underline}. Moreover,
such scenario could encourage other Middle Easter States to develop
their own nuclear weapons. So far, the Israelis have implemented a
policy of dispensing carrots (negotiation proposals) and sticks (air
strikes) to Damascus in an attempt to seduce Syria away from Iran.

On the other hand, the West is not afraid of a nuclear Iran per se. One
can infer that from their refusal to do anything meaningful to prevent
the acquisition of nuclear weapons by States like India, Israel or
Pakistan. Rather, the Americans and the Europeans cannot accept a 'Pax
Iranica' in the Middle East because Teheran would, de facto, control a
zone which contains the world's largest oil reserves, a resource the
Western economies have to import because their domestic supplies are not
enough to meet their consumption needs.

[[In case of an]{.mark} Israeli and/or American [attack]{.mark} against
[Iran]{.mark}, Ahmadinejad's [government]{.mark} [will]{.mark} certainly
[respond]{.mark}. A possible countermeasure would be to fire Persian
ballistic missiles against Israel and maybe even against American
military bases in the regions.]{.underline} [[Teheran]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} unquestionably [resort]{.mark} [to]{.mark} its
[proxies]{.mark} like Hamas or Hezbollah]{.underline} (or even some of
its Shiite allies it has in Lebanon or Saudi Arabia) t[o carry out
attacks against Israel, America and their allies, effectively setting in
flames a large portion of the Middle East. [The ultimate weapon]{.mark}
at Iranian disposal [is]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [block]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[Strait]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Hormuz]{.mark}. If such chokepoint is
indeed asphyxiated, [that would dramatically increase the price
of]{.mark} [oil]{.mark}, this a very threatening retaliation because it
will bring intense financial and economic havoc upon the West, which is
already facing significant trouble in those respects.]{.underline}

[In short, the necessary conditions for a major war in the Middle East
are given. Such conflict could rapidly spiral out of control and thus a
relatively minor clash could quickly and dangerously escalate by
engulfing the whole region and perhaps even beyond]{.underline}. There
are many key players: the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Arabs, the
Persians and their respective allies and some great powers could become
involved in one way or another (America, Russia, Europe, China).
[Therefore, any miscalculation by any of the main protagonists can
trigger something no one can stop. Taking into consideration that the
stakes are too high, perhaps it is not wise to be playing with fire
right in the middle of a powder keg.]{.underline}

## **Uniqueness**

#### US- Israel Relations strong now- OR i-link to a ton of different impacts 

**US Department of State, 04/14/18**

(US Department of State, "US Relations with Israel," US Department of
State, https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-israel/)

U.S.-ISRAEL RELATIONS

The United States was the first country to recognize Israel as a state
in 1948, and the first to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
in 2017. [Israel has long been, and remains, America's most reliable
partner in the Middle East. Israel and the United States are bound
closely by historic and cultural ties as well as by mutual
interests.]{.underline}

Israel's founding was preceded by more than 50 years of efforts to
establish a sovereign state as a homeland for the Jewish people. The
1917 Balfour Declaration asserted the British Government's support for
the creation "in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people."
Following the end of World War I (1914-1918), the League of Nations
entrusted Great Britain with the Mandate for Palestine. Immediately
after the end of British mandate on May 14, 1948, the State of Israel
was proclaimed, and the U.S. recognized Israel that same day. Arabs in
the Mandatory and neighboring Arab states rejected a 1947 UN partition
plan that would have divided the Mandatory into separate Jewish and Arab
states, and the area has seen periods of invasions and armed conflict
since 1948.

[The United States is committed to supporting the parties in efforts to
reach a lasting, comprehensive peace agreement that offers a brighter
future to both Israel and the Palestinians.]{.underline}

U.S. Assistance to Israel

[The U.S.-Israel bilateral relationship is strong, anchored by over \$3
billion in Foreign Military Financing annually.]{.underline} In addition
to financial support, the [U.S. participates in a high level of
exchanges with Israel, to include joint military exercises, military
research, and weapons development]{.underline}. Through the Joint
Counterterrorism Group and a semi-annual Strategic Dialogue, the U.S.
and Israel have enhanced their cooperation in fighting terrorism.

Bilateral Economic Relations

[The United States is Israel's largest single trading
partner.]{.underline} The top five U.S. exports to Israel are: diamonds,
semiconductors, civilian aircraft, telecommunications equipment, and
agricultural products. The top five U.S. imports from Israel are:
diamonds, pharmaceutical products, semiconductors, medicinal equipment,
and telecommunications equipment. [U.S. direct investment in Israel is
primarily in the manufacturing sector, as is Israeli investment in the
United States]{.underline}. The United States and Israel have had a free
trade agreement since 1985, serving as the foundation for expanding
trade and investment between the two countries by reducing barriers and
promoting regulatory transparency. [To facilitate economic cooperation,
the two countries convene a Joint Economic Development Group each year
to discuss economic conditions in both countries and possible economic
reforms for the coming year.]{.underline}

The U.S. and Israel also coordinate scientific and cultural exchanges
through the Binational Science Foundation, the Binational Agricultural
Research and Development Foundation, and the U.S.-Israeli Education
Foundation.

#### Trump and Netanyahu have an unprecedented relationship

East Peace Plan Faces a Crossroads After Coalition Talks in Israel
Crumble," The New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/us/politics/trump-middle-east-peace-israel.html>)

[Mr. Trump has already gone further in his support of Mr. Netanyahu than
any president has for any Israeli leader. Before recognizing Israeli
authority over the Golan Heights, he moved the American Embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem. And]{.underline} in a remarkable intrusion into
Israeli electoral politics, Mr. Trump on [Monday tweeted his support of
Mr. Netanyahu's efforts to form a coalition.]{.underline}

"Hoping things will work out with Israel's coalition formation and Bibi
and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel
stronger than ever," Mr. Trump said, using the prime minister's
nickname. "A lot more to do!"

Two days later, [the White House announced an unprecedented three-way
meeting in Jerusalem of its national security adviser, John R. Bolton,
with his Israeli and Russian counterparts, Meir Ben-Shabbat and Nikolay
Patrushev. The meeting, to discuss security issues in the Middle
East]{.underline}, is a feather in the cap for Mr. Netanyahu,
[underlining his ability to convene the world's major
powers]{.underline}.

Mr. Indyk said a staunchly pro-Israel peace plan --- one that snuffed
out the goal of a two-state solution, for example --- would constitute
Mr. Trump's third major gesture to Mr. Netanyahu, after the embassy and
the Golan Heights.

This week, [after Mr. Netanyahu's coalition negotiations collapsed, Mr.
Trump made no effort to disguise his disappointment]{.underline}.

"It looked like a total win for Netanyahu, who's a great guy," the
president said. "That is too bad. Because they don't need this. I mean
they've got enough turmoil over there. It's a tough place."

### Brink Now 

**Conflict on brink now- Israel has a formidable military with nuclear
capabilities**

**Peck, 07/12/19**

(Michael Peck, contributing writer for the National Interest, "This Is
How Israel Would Fight a War with Iran," National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/how-israel-would-fight-war-iran-66592>)

The Middle East is aflame from Baghdad to Gaza. But the most frightening
conflict is one that is yet to happen. [Though Iran\'s atomic weapons
program has receded from world attention]{.underline}, displaced by the
Syrian Civil War and Islamic extremists overrunning Iraq, [the specter
of an Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facilities hovers over the
region.]{.underline}

Or, [there might be some other trigger]{.underline}. [Perhaps a
Hezbollah attack that draws Israeli retaliation and then Iranian
intervention, or Israel and Iran clashing over Syria. Or, just
misperception and miscalculation. Either way, it would not take much for
Tel Aviv and Tehran to engage in combat.]{.underline}

[Should hostilities erupt, Iran will have to confront one of the most
capable militaries in the world.]{.underline} Here are five Israeli
weapons that should worry Iran:

[Israel has bought 19 F-35s]{.underline}, which are scheduled to begin
arriving in 2017. There are actually two what-ifs regarding the
expensive and controversial U.S. stealth strike aircraft. The first is
whether the F-35 will prove to be an immensely powerful weapon, or an
overpriced, unreliable aircraft that will devour huge chunks of the
American and Israeli budgets.

Even if the engines don\'t catch on fire or the aircraft\'s stealth
design can avoid radar detection, [the F-35 is not an awesome bomb
carrier]{.underline}: to preserve stealth, it has to forego external
weapons and carry just two 2,000-pound JDAM guided bombs in its internal
bomb bay.

Yet the F-35\'s capabilities are actually the smaller what-if. [The
big]{.underline}ger [question isn\'t what the F-35 can do, but rather
what Iran thinks it can do]{.underline}. If the U.S. and Israel can\'t
be sure how effective the F-35 is, then neither can Iran. [In which
case, they will have to assume that Israel possesses a cutting-edge
stealth aircraft that can penetrate Iranian air defenses undetected and
strike nuclear facilities with precision-guided weapons.]{.underline}

F-15I Ra\'am Strike Aircraft

Unlike the F-35[, the F-15I-]{.underline}- the Israeli version of the
F-15E Strike Eagle \-- [is]{.underline} a known and highly capable
aircraft. H[eavily armed with Python 5 air-to-air and Popeye
air-to-ground missiles, as well as electronic countermeasures, Israel\'s
25 F-15Is should be more than a match for Iran\'s handful of MiG-29s and
Mirages, and its elderly fleet of F-14 and F-4s.]{.underline}

Or, weapons even more powerful. [There are reports that Israeli F-35s
will be configured to carry nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

[Israel has gained experience in long-range strike
operations]{.underline}, including raids in Sudan against arms factories
and truck convoys carrying weapons for Hezbollah and Hamas. The distance
between Tel Aviv and Khartoum is almost 1,200 miles, even further than
the thousand-mile distance between Tel Aviv and Tehran.

Of course, [bombing Sudan is much easier than bombing Iran, which has a
fairly sophisticated air defense system]{.underline}. [But Israel\'s
Ra\'ams are a powerful weapon that would be in the forefront of any
Israeli attack on Iran.]{.underline}

Jericho III Missiles

While Iranian missiles have received all the attention, it is worth
remembering that [Israel also has ballistic missiles of its
own]{.underline}. The three-stage Jericho III reportedly can lob a
2.2-ton warhead intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of carrying
a 1,000-kg (2,204-lb.) warhead more than 3,000 miles. [A solid-fueled
missile, which should enable it to be launched quickly if needed, the
Jericho III almost certainly can carry one of the nuclear warheads that
Israel has never admitted to possessing.]{.underline}

[Such missiles, or at least those carrying conventional warheads,
probably aren\'t accurate enough to destroy a pinpoint target like a
nuclear weapons research facility. Israel would also be reluctant to
launch a missile barrage for fear of international backlash, unless the
situation were really critical, such as Iran firing WMDs. Still, in
addition to a potent threat from Israeli aircraft, Tehran also has to
reckon with powerful Israeli missiles.]{.underline}

Dolphin-class Submarines

Israel recently received its fifth German-built Dolphin-class diesel
submarine. The fourth and fifth subs, plus a sixth under construction,
have advanced air-independent propulsion that uses fuel cells to enable
them to stay submerged for far longer than earlier diesel subs.

[In addition to their formidable capabilities as anti-surface and
anti-submarine vessels, these Israeli subs are widely considered to be
equipped with nuclear-armed cruise missiles.]{.underline} They may not
be as sophisticated as U.S. or British nuclear subs with Trident
missiles. But on the other hand, [it\'s not like Iran has much in the
way of anti-submarine warfare capability, let alone the capacity to
deploy it in the Eastern Mediterranean or the Red Sea, from where
Israeli subs could operate close to Israeli waters while still remaining
within firing range of Iran.]{.underline} Much like U.S. missile subs,
[the Dolphins give Israel a second-strike capability to retaliate with
nuclear weapons, even if a surprise attack on the tiny nation were to
destroy Israel\'s other nuclear arms.]{.underline}

#### Israel-Iran tensions high now -- Hezbollah attacks show how Israel believes Iran is expansionist, Proves Mutual Misperception

**Steinberg 06** -- (Gerald Steinberg. Professor of Political Science,
Bar-Ilan University. "Israel Hoping Attacks on Hezbolla Serves as
Warning to Iran". Interview with Prof. Gerald M. Steinberg, Council of
Foreign Relations.
http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/arms%20PDFs/warning2iran.pdf.
DGP)

Gerald M. Steinberg, an American-educated Israeli expert on military and
diplomatic affairs, says behind [the stepped-up fight against Hezbollah
in Lebanon is the Israeli perception that Hezbollah is a
\"proxy\"]{.underline} for Iran. He [says Israeli officials are
convinced Iran is working toward nuclear weapons]{.underline} and hope
after this year\'s congressional elections in the United States,
President Bush might seriously consider force against Iran if the United
Nations fails to act. \"There is a growing view that Iran is not going
to be stopped by the United Nations, by the international community,\"
says Steinberg, professor of political studies at Bar Ilan University in
Israel and director of the Interdisciplinary Program on Conflict
Management and Negotiation. He says in the absence of U.S. action
against Iran, Israel will have to examine its options. \"To some degree,
one of the aims of this war is to make sure in Tehran, when they look at
the pictures of Beirut, they also think about Tehran,\" Steinberg says.

The ferocity of the Israeli response to the abduction of two Israeli
soldiers from the border with Lebanon surprised a number of people. Was
this a long-planned attack?

[Israelis have seen that the Hezbollah presence in Lebanon]{.underline},
particularly in southern Lebanon, [and the **proxy position it is
playing for Iran**]{.underline}, has become more and more dangerous. It
was not just the kidnapping of the soldiers. This was the fourth or
fifth attempt; there were also eight Israelis killed, there was a
barrage of missiles and rockets fired at the same time. This has been
happening once a month. [14,000 or 16,000 missiles stored in concrete
bunkers---you couldn\'t miss]{.underline} it. This response was
something the Israeli military explicitly prepared as a scenario it was
likely to face. The Israeli public understood the implications, meaning
that there would be this length of bombardment. It was generally
expected to last about three weeks; it may take a little bit longer. But
the Israeli public was prepared mentally, psychologically, and I guess
one could say strategically. They understood the stakes, and the stakes
are huge.

Was the first response supposed to be mostly air strikes? Yes. The
expectation was a week to a week and a half would be only air strikes or
primarily air strikes. At that stage the Hezbollah command structure and
the positions in southern Lebanon would be weakened and ground troops
would be able to go in---which is more or less what is happening. There
are less ground troops now than was originally envisioned at the
beginning, and there were more Israeli casualties---a dozen or so
Israeli casualties for Israel is painful--- but in the military sense,
that is more or less what is expected. The bombing of that apartment
structure in Qana on Saturday night---has that caused any second
thoughts in Israel public opinion or do people accept that as a fact of
war? It is clearly a central topic for debate. Israelis watch TV and
listen to the radio; it is all war coverage except for a very few
Israelis who have had enough and tune out, but that is the talk. You go
for a cocktail with diplomats, journalists---it is a small country. We
all know each other, and we all talk about this. The rumors of who has
been killed come to us before they are made public. We know Hezbollah
has been using human shields. We know human rights groups have totally
ignored what is fundamentally a war crime. Nobody should lecture us
about morality because the world has been immoral in their silence. I
think Ehud Olmert, the prime minister, who has a very good political
ear, spoke for all Israelis. Was the two-day pause in the bombing forced
on Israel by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for political reasons?
There are three reasons why: the first was the American pressure, the
second was to change the headlines in the media. To some degree that was
successful, away from Qana and towards Israel\'s agreeing to a
forty-eight hour cease-fire. The third was the terms were not an
absolute cease-fire. The war goes on. The first time that announcement
came out, there was across the-board criticism of it by many of the
Israeli pundits and ex-generals. The initial announcement came from
American sources. \"Why are the Americans telling us this? Why doesn\'t
it come from Israel?\" That was strange, I must admit. Yes, that was a
screwup in terms of the way it was handled. As soon as it was clear this
was not a cease-fire and Hezbollah has not won the war, then it was
something Israelis understood as part of the public diplomacy where we
have been losing.

What is the feeling in Israel of the degree of support in the United
States right now? This is always a very touchy issue. I can remember
previous wars. At some point the United States says \"All right, you\'ve
got to stop it; there is too much world criticism of the United States
on this.\"

These are big stakes here and Israelis understand that. They understand
how this is consistent with the war on terror, the Bush
administration\'s policies, and how it is such a sharp contrast to the
Europeans. Now more than ever the contrast between American strategic
understanding and European ignorance or self-interest grows every day.
[In the Israeli street, there is a broad appreciation that we are in
this with the United States]{.underline}. The United States is giving us
backing. Also, it is in the American administration\'s interest. But
there is also a certain degree of concern that now everything is lumped
together with the United States. Whatever we do, the United States gets
blame; when the United States acts as it does in Iraq, then it reflects
badly on Israel. There is a little bit of liability in being seen as too
close to the United States. In Europe and much of the Arab world, there
is an automatic instinctual reaction: \"[If the United States is for
this, then it has got to be something we have to oppose, regardless of
the situation.\" So we are getting a lot of hostility directed at us. We
probably get it anyway because we are Israel, but even more so because
of this \"Zionist -American neo-con conspiracy theor]{.underline}y.\"

You started out by talking about Iran and Hezbollah. I take it [there is
no question in Israel that Iran is working toward **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. No question.

What is the perception in Israel about the efforts in the United Nations
to get Iran to halt its nuclear program?

There is a growing [view that Iran is not going to be stopped by the
United Nations]{.underline}, by the international community. There is
still some expectation or hope that Bush after the \[U.S.\]
congressional elections will decide that he has to do what he has to do.
But if not, then the question is what is Israel going to do? To some
degree, one of the aims of this war is to make sure in Tehran, when they
look at the pictures of Beirut, they also think about Tehran.

When you say Bush will do what has to be done, you are saying Israel
would like to see the United States attack Iran militarily? It is not a
matter of like to or not like to. It is a matter of trying to get an
assessment. Will the U.S. government present a military attack against
the Iranian nuclear sites as the only option? If not, what are the
Israeli options? If yes, what are the implications for Israel? It is
trying to take a look at it analytically.

Why is Israel so certain they would be targeted by Iran?

It is not a matter of being targeted. **[Israel is certain that Iran is
an expansionist and revolutionary leadership that basically doesn\'t
understand Israel]{.underline}**. They don\'t know what the red lines
are. [There will not be a stable deterrence between Iran and Israel
because the **Iranian leadership does not understand
Israel**]{.underline}. This is not going to be the United States and the
Soviet Union. I teach this to my students when I teach them strategy in
a nuclear age. Everyone studies the Cuban missile crisis and the
India-Pakistan nuclear crises. But in all those cases, there were
diplomatic representatives and diplomatic relations between the
countries, between the adversaries. There was a steam valve that could
be opened to relieve the pressure. You don\'t have anything like that
with Iran. [**Iran understands Israel through a very, very distorted set
of filter**s]{.underline}. Although the leadership may not want to get
in a confrontation with Israel, they could find themselves in one,
manipulated by Hezbollah. I always saw [Hezbollah as the fuse that could
lead to a confrontation with Iran because Iran would then, when it has
nuclear weapons, feel much freer to support Hezbollah.]{.underline}

What about the timing of all this---do you think Hezbollah launched that
attack because of Israel\'s ongoing problems with Hamas or was this just
fortuitous timing? Hezbollah has been trying to kidnap soldiers since
October 2000, five months after the Israeli withdrawal. Hezbollah
launched an attack, kidnapped the bodies of three dead soldiers---we did
not know it at the time. They have done this periodically. It is
something they know how to do. They tried it six weeks before \[the
latest incident\] when there was an Israeli ambush. One of the questions
that has been raised, but we do not have time to deal with it: Why did
they succeed the second time? What did we do wrong? I think this was all
part of the constant salami tactics that may have been used because
Hamas stole some of the thunder and kidnapped an Israeli soldier a
couple of weeks earlier. It might have been done because of the Iranian
nuclear issue.

[In Israel itself, are the polls very high in support of the military
response?]{.underline}

[Absolutely, over 80 percent. There is criticism]{.underline}. \"The
military should have been sitting in southern Lebanon, there should have
been massive call-ups,\" but again these are from the Israeli street.
People who are more involved understand the cost that would have been
involved and are more sympathetic or supportive of the slower approach.
You reject the feeling that Israel is weakened right now? There seems to
be a feeling outside of Israel that somehow Hezbollah is coming out
ahead on this. It is not over until it is over. It is just like in the
United States after the 2003 war in Iraq: Journalists across the board
and pundits and commentators were all talking about how the United
States was not doing well in the war in Iraq until all of a sudden they
showed up in Baghdad. This is a much more complicated war. [We have
allowed Hezbollah---we meaning Israel, United States, Europe,
everybody---to build these huge concrete bunkers, and prepare some
15,000 missiles for this type of confrontation.]{.underline} Anybody who
thought that Hezbollah was going to be wiped off the map and that we
were dealing with guerrillas with no experience and no planning clearly
were wrong.

So right now, what is happening? Troops are being sent into southern
Lebanon?

There are tough battles going on. There are probably more casualties as
Israel takes back what is very difficult terrain, where Hezbollah is
holed up in these reinforced bunkers, and Israel is taking back the
territory slowly on the ground. But the bigger picture is that once
Israel takes back the territory, there will [continue to be low-level
skirmishes]{.underline}, there will continue to be firing here and
there. There is no question about it because you are not going to be
able to find every missile launcher. When a truck or a plane or anything
comes over that looks like it has weapons from Syria or Iran, Israel
will continue to hit those. It will be a war of attrition.

I\'ve heard reports that Syria is on high alert. They are not going to
try to get into this one, are they? Rationally they are not, but you
have got \[President\] Bashar al-Assad with no experience who could
conceivably step over the edge, and the Israeli message is \"Don\'t.\"
You have got a rusty army, and this is a set-piece battle. Israel is
fighting a guerrilla war right now in southern Lebanon, but most of the
Israeli forces are not engaged there. I think something like 20 percent
of the air force is being used and now even less as the war goes on in
Lebanon. There is a huge amount of capability available for this
purpose. It would be foolish for Syria to get involved; they do not have
the capability. The general consensus is the Syrian regime manages to
stay in power by having kept a low profile after the assassination of
\[former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik\] Hariri last year and not
getting overly involved because if they stick their neck out, they will
become a much greater target.

Another war between Israel and Hezbollah is almost inevitable. Although
neither side wants a conflict now, the shifting balance of power in the
Levant and shrinking areas of contestation are indicators of a [looming
showdown](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2017-12-14/israel-draws-redline-syria).
The real questions are how and where---not if---the impending
conflagration will occur.

The events of February 10 underscored the Levant's instability.
**[Israel shot down an Iranian drone that flew into its
airspace]{.underline}** and bombed the site in Syria from which the
drone had allegedly been launched; during the latter mission, Syrian
antiaircraft fire downed an Israeli F-16, the first Israeli fighter to
be shot down by enemy fire in decades. [Israel responded with massive
retaliation against a slew of Iranian and regime-affiliated military
targets in Syria.]{.underline}

[Tensions]{.underline} in the region [are only going to get
worse]{.underline}. The [Syrian civil
war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/syria/2017-10-16/keeping-out-syria) has
so far resulted in nearly half a million dead, six million internally
displaced, and over five million refugees, an overwhelming percentage of
whom have now spent years in neighboring countries such as Lebanon and
Jordan, which are eager for their swift departure. Yet as the [fight
against the Islamic State
(ISIS)](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2017-09-25/how-isis-transforming)winds
down militarily, so too will the many marriages of convenience among its
enemies. These impending divorces will return a number of issues to the
foreground, including governance and reconciliation, the future of
outside powers in Syria, and the shifting regional balance of power.
**[The resulting tensions are likely to bring Israel to the brink of a

THE NEXT WAR

For Israel and Hezbollah, the defeat of ISIS and the resulting shifts in
focus will clarify the increasingly complex and dangerous relations
between them. [Hezbollah]{.underline} has lost nearly 2,000 fighters in
Syria, damaged its reputation through unfettered [support for the

Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah spar regularly, and Hezbollah's
intervention in the Syrian civil war expanded their conflict's front
line. In the years since the war began in 2011, Israel has attacked
Hezbollah weapons depots and forces in Syria, and
Hezbollah [boasts](https://www.thenation.com/article/israel-and-hezbollah-are-girding-for-war-and-the-next-round-could-be-horrific/) that
it shot down an Israeli F-16 jet. **[A senior U.S. intelligence officer
cautions that there is "real potential" of a war between Israel and
Hezbollah and that such a war could drag in Iran and other regional
powers]{.underline}**. Mara Karlin, a leading outside
analyst, [contends](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2018-02-21/israels-coming-war-hezbollah) that
[war is "almost inevitable" and that the "real questions are how and
where---not if---the impending conflagration will occur."]{.underline}
Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah,
also [warns](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Leader-of-Hezbollah-US-sanctions-on-Iran-will-not-yield-results-558391) that
Israel is always a threat to Lebanon and Hezbollah. Yet war has
threatened for over a decade, and despite regular sparring, neither side
has gone over the brink. What explains this enduring, if turbulent,
peace---and will it last?

The risks for Israel in Lebanon are far higher than in its periodic
battles with Hamas in Gaza. In 2006, Hezbollah launched a cross-border
raid, killing three Israeli soldiers and capturing two. The raid sparked
a massive Israeli bombing campaign and then ground assault, [much to
Hezbollah's
surprise](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/27/mideast.nasrallah/).
Hezbollah, however, was prepared for a fight and kept the rockets
falling on Israel throughout the 34-day conflict. The war ended in a
draw. Hezbollah and Nasrallah [were
lauded](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/world/middleeast/07nasrallah.html) throughout
the Arab world for their successful defiance of Israel.

More than 10 years later, [Hezbollah's military capabilities are even
more formidable]{.underline}. [It [has over 100,000 rockets and
missiles](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/iran-will-spare-hezbollah-in-its-conflict-with-israel-for-now) and
can fire over 1,000 per day, targeting almost every major city in
Israel]{.underline}. Hezbollah [also manufactures
weapons](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/03/lebanon-syria-israel-iran-war-weapons-war-achievements.html) in
Lebanon, [producing drones and guided missiles]{.underline}, amongst
other systems. In the past, Hezbollah rockets had crude guidance systems
and mostly landed on Israeli fields or other unpopulated parts of the
country. Now, however, Hezbollah has systems, like the Fateh-110,
that [use advanced guidance
systems](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/07/hezbollah-iran-new-weapons-israel/565796/).
If another conflict were to break out, Israel would face the potential
loss of power plants, its airport, key political and cultural sites, and
other grave threats. Israel's layered missile-defense and anti-rocket
systems like Iron Dome and David's Sling will offer some protection, but
they would be tested by the scale and scope of Hezbollah's arsenal.

Politically, Hezbollah is also secure. In the May 2018 parliamentary
elections, Hezbollah won additional seats, and its power grew at the
expense of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, the leader of Lebanon's Sunni
Muslims. Hezbollah already had a de facto veto over government decisions
in Lebanon, and its strong election performance further strengthens it.

The biggest difference for Hezbollah since 2006 is its participation in
the Syrian civil war, a source of both strength and weakness. Hezbollah
sent thousands of fighters to Syria, and they played a major role in
shoring up the Assad regime. In Syria, Hezbollah also gained and
imparted valuable skills. [Hezbollah fighters
learned](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lebanese-hezbollah-offers-a-glimpse-of-its-firepower) to
work with Russian air power, use tanks, and even do a small airborne
operation. They acquired an array of more conventional systems, from
T-72 tanks to infantry fighting vehicles. [[Group members
taught](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/03/lebanon-syria-israel-iran-war-weapons-war-achievements.html)
reconnaissance and weaponry skills to Syrian forces as well as to the
Afghans and Pakistanis that Iran also sent to fight in
Syria.]{.underline} In addition, [Hezbollah indoctrinated its trainees
with its revolutionary and anti-Israel message]{.underline}. Indeed,
Syrian forces even recruited Hezbollah members as commanders. Having
blooded fighters and tested commanders makes Hezbollah stronger.

Yet while Hezbollah is more formidable due to its experience in Syria,
in other ways the group is weaker. Before the war, Hezbollah enjoyed
some respect from Lebanon's Sunni Muslim and Christian communities for
its relative lack of corruption (compared with other Lebanese actors),
ability to provide services effectively in areas it controlled, and
steadfast opposition to Israel. Siding with the butcher Assad against
the Sunni Muslim opposition, however, made [**Hezbollah** **look**
**like** an **Iranian**- and Syrian-controlled **sectarian** **actor**
rather than an Islamic resistance force]{.underline}. For much of the
Sunni Arab world, Hezbollah became the devil incarnate. Its support
among Lebanese Shiites remains strong, but they bore the brunt of
the [casualties Hezbollah suffered in
Syria](https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1204601/exclusive-why-iran%E2%80%99s-intervention-syria-proved-so-costly)---at
least 1,400---and are not eager to fight another war that promises more
bloodshed.

In addition, Hezbollah's military endeavors in Syria would not
necessarily prove useful to conflict with Israel. Hezbollah forces
assaulted lightly armed and poorly trained rebels in many urban parts of
Syria, but the skills learned would do them little good defending
Lebanon's south against well-trained Israeli forces. Although
Hezbollah's conventional capabilities are stronger than ever, employing
them against Israel would prove disastrous. The group's tanks would be
death traps when fighting Israel's superior forces, and if Hezbollah's
fighters fought in the larger formations they used for assaults in
Syria, the Israeli air force and helicopters would devastate them.
Should war come to Lebanon, Hezbollah instead will seek to use its
rockets and will focus its forces on defending this arsenal from Israeli
air and ground attacks. [It has dug over 1,000 tunnels and
bunkers](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lebanese-hezbollah-offers-a-glimpse-of-its-firepower)
to hide its weapons and fighters. If Israel again invaded Lebanon to
disrupt the rocket attacks, Hezbollah would try, as it did in 2006, to
take advantage of south Lebanon's steep valleys to force Israeli forces
into narrow areas where they are vulnerable to attack. Israel, however,
learned from its 2006 debacle and is far less likely to repeat the
mistakes of the last war. Given these military and political limits,
Hezbollah is not eager to take on Israel. Although the group still
nominally seeks the eradication of the Jewish state, it is well aware
that this objective is not realistic. In the May 2018 elections, it
[campaigned on domestic
issues](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/iran-israel-syria/560210/),
not the fight against its Zionist enemy. Indeed, its campaign slogan was
"We will construct and we will protect"---a far cry from a new war with
Israel. Moreover, Hezbollah's Shiite rival, Amal, gained some seats in
the May elections, playing up Hezbollah's unpopular intervention in
Syria. In sum, because Hezbollah wants to wield power in Lebanon, it is
[less likely to use the country as a theater for the fight against
Israel](http://www.inss.org.il/publication/parliamentary-elections-lebanon-hezbollahs-victory-within-political-status-quo/),
especially if it can do so in Syria instead. Indeed, Israel sees
Hezbollah's strong political position in Lebanon as a vulnerability and
as enhancing Israel's deterrent powers. Given Hezbollah's greater
political influence after the 2018 elections and role in the Lebanese
government, Israel is better able to [hold the entire government
responsible](http://www.inss.org.il/publication/parliamentary-elections-lebanon-hezbollahs-victory-within-political-status-quo/)
for any actions emanating from Lebanon and threaten massive retaliation
there, an approach [recently
endorsed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-terror-groups-election-success-shows-hezbollah-is-lebanon/)
by Education Minister (and rising political force) Naftali Bennett.
Israel can upset the Lebanese apple cart even without the massive
bombing that characterized the 2006 war: Even small raids and other
forms of lower-level military pressure would scare off investment and
tourism. This thinking, however, flies in the face of past U.S. policy,
which sought to separate the Lebanese government from Hezbollah and to
strengthen government forces. Since 2006, the United States has
[provided almost \$2
billion](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/05/pentagon-ok-90-million-lebanon-army-hezbollah.html)
in equipment to the Lebanese army and helped train its forces even
though the Hezbollah remains an important part of the Lebanese regime.
In addition, Israeli retaliation against Hezbollah strongholds would
entail heavy civilian casualties, as Hezbollah's forces are intermingled
with Lebanon's population. Although Israeli policymakers would blame
Hezbollah for the inevitable damage of using human shields and the Trump
administration would back them, the pictures of dead civilians would
lead much of the world to blame Israel. At least one area of policy
uncertainty lies in Tehran. President Trump's decision to scuttle the
Iran deal gives the Islamic Republic less of a stake in preserving
regional order. On the other hand, however, Tehran's leaders [may fear
that Trump's decision is a prelude to
war](https://www.ft.com/content/ef102926-8f1e-11e8-bb8f-a6a2f7bca546)
and want to avoid ratcheting up tensions. Hezbollah's future role in
Syria also remains a question mark. When Syria was strong and Lebanon
was weak, the Assad regime harassed Israel from Lebanese territory,
using proxies there to keep the fight against Israel far from its home.
However, now the table has turned, with Hezbollah and Iran playing a
major role in Syria (and eliciting Israeli strikes on Syrian turf), it
may prove difficult to keep the Syrian and Lebanese theaters distinct.
Israel has to worry that the Syria and Lebanon fronts will merge in a
crisis---a "northern war," as [Israeli officials describe
it](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/are-israel-and-iran-headed-to-war).

The most likely result is that Israel and Hezbollah will maintain a
violent peace. However, as happened in 2006, **[miscalculation and
provocations]{.underline}** might **[lead]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** unexpected **[escalation]{.underline}**. Even a
conflict that begins in Syria may not stay confined there. [Both sides
are prepared for war this time---should it occur, conflict is likely to
be painful for all concerned]{.underline}.

#### Israel-Iran war is likely now -- Mutual misperception and escalating tensions

**Ben-Meir 19** -- (Alon Ben-Meir. Alon Ben-Meir (PhD, Oxford

Center for Global Affairs, and Senior Fellow and Middle Eastern Studies
Project Director at the World Policy Institute. He has authored seven
books related to the Middle East and is currently working on a new book
about countering violent extremism. "Preventing an Israeli-Iran War".
American Diplomacy.
http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/.DGP)

The EU is in a unique position to prevent the outbreak of a war between
Israel and Iran that could engulf the Middle East in a war that no one
can win. Accusing Iran of being a rogue country bent on acquiring
nuclear weapons, supporting extremist groups and terrorism, persistently
threatening Israel, and destabilizing the region in its relentless
effort to become the dominant power may well all be justified. The
question is, what would it take to stop Iran from its destabilizing
activities and help make it a constructive member of the international
community, and avoid military confrontation with either the US or Israel
or both? The answer is not regime change, as Israeli Prime Minister
Netanyahu and top American officials advocate, but a diplomatic
solution. The EU, led by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom -- who
continue to adhere to the JCPOA -- should initiate a behind-the-scenes
dialogue and pave the way for US involvement in a negotiating process
with Iran to find a peaceful solution and prevent a catastrophic
military confrontation.

Evaluating US-Iran historic relations The toppling of the
democratically-elected Mosaddeq government in 1953 and the installing of
the corrupt Shah as king of the country, coupled with the US' treatment
of Iran since the 1979 revolution, constitute a series of errors in
judgment of successive American administrations over the past 40 years.
In the wake of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, Iran's President Rafsanjani
made several attempts to improve relations with the US. He offered the
American oil company Conoco a contract to develop one of Iran's largest
oil fields, but a deal was blocked by the US. Also, efforts made by
moderates within the Shiite regime searching for common ground with the
US after September 11 were rebuffed by the US, even though Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami, known to be a reformer, was in power. In
2002, President Bush shut down what was left of any opening with Iran by
characterizing it, along with Iraq and North Korea, as the "axis of
evil," accusing them of being allied with terrorists "arming to threaten
the peace of the
world."[\[i\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn1)
Thus, instead of exploiting any opening to initiate a new dialogue,
successive American administrations remained focused on containing Iran
and never precluded the use of force to that end. Naturally, this played
into the hands of radical Iranian officials, who viewed the US as the
"Great Satan", bent on undermining the regime and not to be trusted.
Feeling rejected and threatened by the US, Tehran decided to take
advantage of the fragile American strategy to forge an
Israeli-Palestinian peace by supporting several Palestinian radical
groups opposed to Israel's existence. Fear of an American invasion,
especially following the Iraq War, Iran's historic rivalry against Saudi
Arabia, and its concerns over Israel's undeclared nuclear weapons
further strengthened its resolve to become the region's 'superpower.'
Tehran decided to pursue a weaponized nuclear program to prevent an
American invasion and neutralize Israel's nuclear arsenal. Iran took
full advantage of the Iraq War, which gave Iraq to Iran on a silver
platter, and moved strategically to entrench itself in the predominantly
Shiite country. It came quickly to the rescue of Assad's regime in Syria
with the intension of establishing a permanent presence and securing a
corridor that links it to the Mediterranean through Iraq, Syria, and
Lebanon, where it has already cemented its presence through Hezbollah.
Furthermore, Iran interjected itself into the civil war in Yemen by
providing financial aid and arms to the Shiite-leaning Houthis with the
intention of establishing a foothold in the Arabian Peninsula. All
along, Iran vigorously pursued the development of ballistic missiles
while providing Islamic jihadists and terror groups throughout the
Middle East with training and military materials. To be sure, Tehran had
every incentive not only to undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process but to impede and frustrate America's overall Middle East
policy, which further reaffirmed the US' belief that Iran is a regional
menace that must be dealt with accordingly. Unlike his predecessors,
President Obama was determined to change the dynamic of the conflict
with Iran by moving from confrontation to negotiation. Obama concluded
that waging a war against Iran would at best set its effort to acquire
nuclear weapons back for only two to three years, but would likely
precipitate a disastrous regional war. Even though Iran could
potentially suffer tremendous losses and destruction of its nuclear
facilities, it would recover and become even more determined to resume
its nuclear weapons program. Consequently, Obama decided to defuse the
tension with Iran by first focusing on preventing it from acquiring
nuclear weapons, which was the most disconcerting issue for US and its
allies in the region, especially Israel. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPOA) was also seen as a prerequisite to improve
relations and nurture trust, as EU foreign policy chief Federica
Mogherini said in Brussels: "the deal was put in place exactly because
there was no trust between the
parties..."[\[ii\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn2)
The idea was to create an atmosphere conducive to reducing tensions by
gradually lifting the sanctions parallel to Iran's compliance with all
the provisions of the deal. This would have allowed the nurturing of
trust and opened the door for negotiations to settle other conflicting
issues. After two years of intense negotiations, the JCPOA was struck
with the full support of the UNSC permanent members plus Germany, as
well as the EU, which Israel vehemently opposed and rallied against.

Convinced of Iran's mischiefs and eager to fulfill his campaign promise,
Trump withdrew from the deal in May 2018 and re-imposed severe sanctions
on Iran, deeply disturbing European allies and heightening anew tensions
with Iran, making the US a part of the problem not of the solution which
brings us to the present impasse.

Considering the psychological and emotional dispositions

The search for a lasting solution must factor in the [psychological,
emotional, and political disposition]{.underline} and national interests
of the main players, namely [Iran, Israel, and the US]{.underline}.

Iran takes special pride in its continuing history of over 2,500 years.
The last time it was conquered by an entity that dominated the Persian
culture was in the 4th century BCE by Alexander the Great, whose
Hellenic state lasted for a short period of time. Iran enjoys immense
cultural riches, an abundance of natural resources, and a pivotal
geostrategic location. It is the heart of Shiite Islam with a population
of over 74 million, which is larger than the combined Sunni population
of the Gulf states by more than 30 million.

Given its history, resourcefulness, and ability to project its power,
[Iran is a proud nation that seeks respect and rejects
bullying]{.underline}. [Iran is resilient]{.underline}; it can be
defeated time and again, but it will rise in defiance of any
circumstances, ready and willing to sacrifice whatever it takes, and not
allow itself to be humiliated. These characteristics reflect who the
Iranians really are, and why they feel that being the region's hegemon
is only natural. Both Israel and the US must keep this in mind, and
carefully consider it before either or both contemplates any attack on
major Iranian targets.

[Israel is extraordinarily sensitive on matters of national security,
and from its perspective, any country or countries that pose an
existential threat would do so at their peril]{.underline}. The [Jews
were subject to extermination]{.underline} less than 75 years ago, when
six million were murdered by the Nazis. For Israelis, the phrase 'never
again' is not a slogan. It represents the core of their very being not
to ever compromise on any issue that might have adverse national
security implications.

Israel takes the Iranian existential threat with the utmost seriousness
and would resort to any means at its disposal to obliterate the source
of such threat. Iran must bear this in mind as well. Once **[Israel
perceives the Iranian threat to be a clear and present danger, it would
act and inflict an unacceptable level of damage to safeguard its
national security]{.underline}**, with or without the support of the US.

The US: President Trump came to power predisposed to undo Obama's deal,
embracing the policies of prior administrations that believed in
confrontation rather than negotiation with Iran. Trump's unilateral
withdrawal of the US from the JCPOA, partly at the urging of Netanyahu,
and the re-imposition of severe sanctions reaffirmed in the mindset of
the Iranian clergy that the US is determined to effect regime change,
which they fear the most. Although pursuing regime change is not the
official policy of the US, it is clear that this is the intent of the
current administration. Prior to his appointment as National Security
Advisor, John Bolton stated in July 2017, "The declared policy of the
United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs' regime
in Tehran. The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going
to change and, therefore, the only solution is to change the regime
itself."[\[iii\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn3)
Furthermore, Bolton has begun to restructure the National Security
Council, filling it with friendly hawks, overseen by Richard Goldberg,
who was a fierce advocate of regime change in Iran during his tenure at
the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The same sentiment has been
repeatedly echoed by Rudy Giuliani---Trump's personal attorney---who
openly calls for regime change, which has only affirmed the
administration's ultimate intentions.

Four perilous scenarios

Should the Trump administration remain adamant on regime change, it is
more than likely that one of the following scenarios will unfold, which
could lead to a catastrophic development.

Bellicose narrative leads to violence: The threats and counterthreats
between Iran and Israel could lead to miscalculation, resulting in an
unintended outbreak of a catastrophic war that neither side wants nor
can win. As it continues to escalate, such narratives also create a
public perception both in Israel and Iran that military confrontation
may well be inevitable. As a result, both countries would become
entrapped by their bellicose narrative against one another, in which any
incident perceived to threaten the national security of either side
could trigger a devastating military confrontation.

Rhetoric like the statements by a senior Revolutionary Guard commander,
stating that "if they \[the United States\] attack us, we will raze Tel
Aviv and Haifa to the
ground"[\[iv\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn4),
and Netanyahu's response that if Iran attempts such an attack, it will
fail and "...this would be the last anniversary of the revolution that
they
celebrate"[\[v\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn5),
should be avoided at all costs, and the Trump administration must
refrain from adding fuel to the fiery narrative.

Attacks in Syria spark further conflict: Israel's continuing attacks on
Iranian military installations in Syria, from which Iran has sustained
heavy losses, could pressure Iran to retaliate as it will no longer
allow itself to be humiliated now that these attacks are in the open.
Iran's tendency to overly exaggerate its military prowess, which it has
come to believe in, and Israel's psychologically rooted fear of
existential threats, narrows the space of reasonable discourse.

The problem here is that Israel's determination not to allow Iran to
establish permanent military bases in Syria, and conversely Tehran's
determination not to cut its losses and leave, shortens the time before
an outright military confrontation could occur. These conditions are
further aggravated by Trump's support of Netanyahu's military campaign
against Iran in Syria, bringing [Israel and Iran ever closer to the
precipice of war]{.underline}.

One of the potentially explosive conflicts that must be defused
immediately with the help of Russia is Iran's determination to maintain
a military presence in Syria. Iran is unlikely to leave Syria
voluntarily, nor will Israel be able to dislodge it by force. Iran
understands that it cannot threaten Israel from Syrian territory and
continue to supply Hezbollah and Hamas with military equipment,
including rockets, challenging Israel from three fronts with impunity.
Iran will be wise to remove all its military encampments eastward to the
Iraqi border to persuade Israel that it has no designs against it.
Otherwise, Israeli attacks on Iranian military installations in Syria
will continue, and it could to escalate into a full-blown war. Effecting
regime change in Iran: Trump's desire to effect regime change -- by
imposing sanctions to dislocate the Iranian economy and instigate public
unrest, while trying to isolate Iran internationally -- could create
chaotic conditions in the country, but it does not guarantee that regime
change will in fact be realized. Unlike the US' successful attempt in
1953 by toppling the then-Mosaddeq government, in today's Iran the
clergy is far more entrenched in every aspect of life. Although Iranians
are suffering and ordinary people take a serious personal risk by
demonstrating against the government and demanding change, this public
pressure is not enough to unseat the government, as the Trump
administration is hoping for. It does, however, compel the government to
search for new avenues to alleviate the worsening economic conditions.
The mullahs have shown an inordinate capacity to ruthlessly quell any
public unrest, and it can count on the powerful Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) to safeguard the survival of the clergy, because in
protecting the mullahs, the Guard protects its own elite position. This
mutuality of interests and dependency explains why the clergy allocates
a significant portion of Iran's national budget to the Guard, regardless
of the overall economic hardship from which the public is suffering.
Individuals affiliated with the IRGC lobbied the government to spend no
less than 5 percent of the total budget on the military, which was
approved in 2016. Since 2014, the military budget has increased 53
percent in real
terms.[\[vi\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn6)While
the official budget currently allocates only 7.5 percent to the
military, vast sums of money are funneled to the Guard through other
means.[\[vii\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn7)
To be sure, regime change precipitated by American sanctions and
intimidation could lead to widespread bloodshed in the country, but with
little if any prospect of success. Waging a premeditated war against
Iran: This is the worst option of all, as there is simply no way to
predict the ultimate outcome. To suggest, as some Israelis do, that a
surgical attack of Iran's nuclear facilities carried out jointly by the
US and Israel will not necessarily evolve into a regional war displays a
clear lack of understanding of the Iranian psychological and political
disposition. Regardless of cost in blood and treasure, Iran will
retaliate, which could plunge the Middle East into a devastating war
from which no one will escape unscathed. Given the fact that no war
could obliterate Iran, and Israel's low threshold of casualties, any
Iranian attack on Israel in the course of a war that results in the
death of thousands of Israelis while inflicting massive destruction may
well force Israel to resort to the use of WMDs. This option becomes even
more realistic should Israel believe that Iran is posing an imminent
existential threat. For this reason, no sane Israeli or American should
even contemplate a premeditated war and must stop short of nothing to
prevent an accidental one. Trump is dangerous. He may go to war with
Iran only to distract the attention of the American people from his
ever-growing personal troubles. Senators Tom Udall (D-NM) and Richard J.
Durbin (D-IL) are absolutely on target, writing in the Washington Post
that "The Trump administration's Iran policy, built on the ashes of the
failed Iraq strategy, is pushing us to take military action aimed at
regime change in
Tehran."[\[viii\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn8)
The senators must accelerate their proposed drafting of "legislation by
a bipartisan group of senators that would restrict any funds from being
spent on an unconstitutional attack against Iran." That said, however,
there are certain conditions under which resorting to war would be less
consequential than doing nothing. While a war of choice is truly the
worst option, a just war in which the consequences of engaging in battle
vastly outweigh the consequences of doing nothing, may be the only
option. Ultimately, all parties to the conflict must do everything in
their power not to allow the current situation to deteriorate to a point
where even a just war becomes the only viable option.

Iran's concerns and fears

[Iran's threat perception originates from its sense of encirclement,
fearing not only the US and Israel but also Pakistan and India as
nuclear powers]{.underline}, which compels it to pursue a defensive
policy. Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif stated that "we will neither
outsource our security nor will we renegotiate or add onto a deal we
have already implemented in good
faith."[\[ix\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn9) As
a result, Iran feels that it has every justification to accelerate its
ballistic missile program, which poses a greater danger not only to
Israel but to the US' allies throughout the region. In addition, Iran
feels that it would further benefit by increasing its financial support
to extremist groups to destabilize the region, which it has and will
continue to exploit.

Iran faces three major concerns of the Iranian moderates (led by Rouhani
and Zarif), who strongly feel that Iran should lower the volume of its
bellicose rhetoric and be pragmatic in addressing the urgent issues the
country is facing. Economic hardship: Ayatollah Yazdi, who spoke to
conservative Iranian students on the occasion of the 40thanniversary of
the revolution, claimed that "In these 40 years, 400 years' worth of
service has been rendered to this country and we have had 400 years'
worth of growth and
progress..."[\[x\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn10)
Notwithstanding his boasting about the progress Iran made since the
revolution, the mullahs know better than that. According to World Bank
data from 2018, per capita GDP in Iran has fallen approximately 30
percent since 1976, meaning the average Iranian citizen has become 30
percent
poorer.[\[xi\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn11)
President Rouhani is painfully aware of the need to alleviate economic
hardship, which he sees as central to Iran's long-term stability more so
than focusing on developing more advanced missiles. In January 2015, the
conflict between Rouhani and the IRGC over the JCPOA became extremely
heated. During these intense discussions between the two sides, Rouhani
asked, "Are we strong because we have all kind of weapons, but we depend
on others to supply us with wheat, meat, oil and sugar?", adding that
"some of us think that because we have missiles, we are strong...We
cannot grow when we are isolated...Our ideology does not rely on
\[nuclear\]
centrifuges."[\[xii\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn12)
Although this encounter happened over three years ago, little has
changed since. Rouhani, with Khamenei's blessing, refused to accept
Zarif's resignation, who has earned respect among EU member states,
strengthening the hands of the moderate camp over the extremist Guard.
Rouhani wants his country to continue to adhere to the JCPOA, and do not
want to risk losing the continued European support of the deal.

[Iran's fear of an Israeli or US attack: Iran is fearful of a
pre-emptive Israeli or American attack on its nuclear facilities,
military installations, and many other targets of value, especially now
under Trump and following the seizure of Iran's nuclear archives by
Israel. The uncovered materials reveal that Iran has violated its
longstanding nuclear non-proliferation commitment]{.underline}. Although
Iran's active pursuit of nuclear weapons ended in 2003, it continued its
intellectual pursuit, hiding those documents after the JCPOA was signed
in 2015. Without the deal, Iran would likely be in a position to produce
such weapons within two years, which would certainly invite an American
onslaught.

Russia's dominant role in Syria: Notwithstanding Russia's and Iran's
marriage of convenience in Syria, Tehran knows that Russia does not want
it to entrench itself deeply in Syria, as this would infringe on
Moscow's dominant role in the country. Moreover, Russia is more
concerned about Israel's security, in particular due to the over one
million Russian citizens living in Israel and their long-standing
collaborative relationship. Russia has turned a blind eye to the
constant Israeli attacks on Iranian military installations in Syria with
the understanding that Israel will not attack Syrian targets. Iran wants
to get something in return for its heavy investment, militarily and
financially, in Syria throughout the civil war, but it finds itself in
retreat because of the Russian position and Assad's greater confidence
in Russia's commitment to securing his position.

Regardless of its continued military buildup and its boasting about its
ability to project its military power, Iran feels vulnerable and
increasingly more isolated. The Iranian moderates, led by Rouhani with
the support of the clergy, know that they must compromise and be open to
a new dialogue to ease the country's economic hardship and ensure its
political security, as long as they do not lose face.

European sources transacting with Iran suggest that Tehran will be open
to further negotiations if it is assured that regime change is not the
ultimate objective of the US. Thus, the US and its allies must focus on
a diplomatic solution that can change, over time, Iran's behavior.
Indeed, the Iranian government wants to normalize relations with its
neighbors and Western powers, which is central to its political
stability, economic progress, and ultimately its survival.

The role of the EU The EU is in a perfect position to play a significant
role to initiate dialogue in order to defuse tensions and start a new
negotiating process to deal with all the conflicting issues, from which
Iran can benefit. The three individual Western signatories to the JCPOA
continue to adhere to it and have workable relations with Iran, while
maintaining a fairly good relationship with the Trump administration.
The EU must initiate behind the scene negotiations with Iran, if it
hasn't already, and along with the US, develop and agree upon a joint
cohesive strategic plan to mitigate the conflict with Iran based on the
carrot-and-stick approach. The Warsaw conference revealed disunity and
disagreement between the US and its allies in addressing the Iran
problem. Although the conference was ostensibly convened to address the
crises sweeping the Middle East, the focus quickly shifted to Iran,
which was the intention of the US in the first place. The Trump
administration wanted to rally the international community behind its
confrontational policy toward Iran, to which the European countries
object, as was manifested by the low-level delegations they sent to the
conference. For Iran, this display of disunity provided it the
opportunity to take full advantage of the Western alliance's discord and
trade with many other countries to compensate for American sanctions.
That said, the EU must make it clear to Tehran that it cannot count on
the discord between the EU and the US particularly in connection with
the JCPOA to last indefinitely, because the current development of
events is perilously explosive. Germany, France, and the UK ought to
persuade the US that its confrontational approach will not work, at
least not before Iran is given the opportunity to assess the cost and
benefit from its belligerent activity and conclude that the cost would
by far outweigh the benefit. Secretary of State Pompeo's unabashed
statement that "you can't achieve stability in the Middle East without
confronting Iran. It's just not
possible"[\[xiii\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn13),
a position that Netanyahu reiterated the day after, will in fact lead
nowhere except to military confrontation.

Engaging in interest-based negotiations

The new talks with Iran, led by Germany, France, and the UK, should not
be limited to the details of the current deal. If the EU wants to launch
a useful initiative, it should enlarge the scope of its demands and call
for a multi-layered negotiation, dealing with several relevant issues
related to the security of the whole region. The talks should address
the need for Iran to stop its continuing support of extremist groups,
its encouragement of terrorism and subversion, deployment of missiles to
Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, and use of Shiite militias to fight
its proxy wars Syria and Yemen. The negotiators should also engage in a
discussion about the future of the JCPOA. In addition, Iran should be
required to provide a full account of its nuclear weapon history and
present all information pertaining to its nuclear facilities and
equipment, as was uncovered by the archives, along with the technology
and materials that it has hidden from the international monitors. In
particular, notwithstanding Gen. Ali Hajizadeh's (the head of Iran's
missile program) vow that the program will never stop "under any
circumstances"[\[xiv\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn14),
the new talks should fully address Iran's ballistic missile program, as
it represents a threat to Israel and Saudi Arabia. Pierre Vimont, senior
fellow at Carnegie Europe, observes that "These different challenges all
boil down to the issue of a regional security arrangement for the whole
region. Highly ambitious indeed, but the response to the current
mistrust between Iran and its neighbors can only come from a clear
perspective of where this whole region should be heading to ensure a
sustainable
stability."[\[xv\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn15)
The 2018 leak of materials from Iran's archive shows that Iran made the
deal in bad faith, hiding details such as the extent of its weapons
program from the negotiators, which would have affected the outcome -- a
point at which the P5+1 would have legitimate reasons from withdrawing
from the deal. Consistent with the three resolutions by the UNSC that
required Iran to end its ballistic missile program, the EU must make it
clear that its continued adherence to the JCPOA and future cooperation
will be directly linked to Iran's adherence to these resolutions.
Otherwise, it would join with the US to impose crippling sanctions,
which would cause an immeasurable economic crisis from which the country
will suffer. The new negotiations should be based on quid pro quo
without any preconditions, aiming to achieve a comprehensive deal in
stages to enhance mutual credibility and build trust. Every conflicting
issue must be placed on the table and a solution to any such issue, for
example, an agreement on freezing Iran's research and development of
ballistic missiles, is reciprocated by lifting a specific set of
sanctions from which Iran can derive immediate benefit. To be sure,
Western powers should offer Iran a path for normalization of relations,
removing sanctions, and assurances that the West will not seek regime
change. Both sides need to agree on a specific time frame to end the
negotiations with a mutually satisfactory agreement to prevent Iran from
dragging out the negotiations for a hidden sinister agenda. Given,
however, the complexity of these negotiations, both sides must also
demonstrate some flexibility time-wise, as long as there is clear
progress and both sides are negotiating convincingly in good faith,
allowing both sides to develop a vested interest in continuing the
negotiating process. In addition, the countries in the region,
especially the Gulf states and Israel, which might be affected by any
new deal, should be informed about the nature of the negotiations and
make every effort to mitigate any old or new concerns they might raise.
Indeed, getting these countries on board and in support of a new deal is
central to regional stability---which all the states in the region,
including Iran, want to maintain. I do not share the view of the first
President of the Islamic Republic, Abolhassan Banisadr, who believes
that "The collapse of the Islamic republic is not a possibility, it is
inevitable, it will definitely happen... The people of Iran and Islam
itself have fallen victim to a 'mulltaria' (mullah+military) and a
renewed
dictatorship."[\[xvi\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn16)
Iran under the Ayatollahs has survived for 40 years, and there is
nothing on the horizon to suggest that it is about to be toppled because
of domestic or foreign pressure under the current circumstances.
Sanctions in and of themselves, however crippling, will not precipitate
regime change, and attacking Iran would have unpredictably terrifying
consequences that have the potential of plunging the Middle East into a
war that no country in the region wants. Moreover, as seen by Vimont,
"The confrontation with America is forcing Iran to move East due to the
sanctions regime (and the need to shift the Iranian trade patterns to
new partners) and the uncertainty over a possible peace process in
Afghanistan. China's presence in Pakistan and its efforts to open new
maritime roads and harbors are becoming an important feature in Iran's
strategic thinking. The US administration would be wise to take into
consideration these developments to avoid a perilous loss of influence
in this whole
region."[\[xvii\]](http://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2019/05/preventing-an-israeil-iran-war/#_edn17)

Conclusion

[Iran must understand that it cannot continue on its current path with
impunity. Iran is arming itself to the teeth, including developing
ballistic missiles that can reach Israel, openly supporting militarily
radical groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, who are sworn to Israel's
destruction, and establishing military bases in Syria from which it can
attack Israel's heartland. Iran should not be foolish enough to expect
Israel not to react militarily by any means at its
disposal.]{.underline}

Iran needs to also be aware that attacking Israel directly or by proxy
(or both) is akin to suicide, as [Israel will take no chances when it
comes to its national security]{.underline}. Likewise, [Iran should not
expect]{.underline} the EU and [the US to continue to tolerate its
destructive activities]{.underline} in the Middle East by meddling in
the affairs of other states, threatening their allies, and destabilizing
the region while undermining their geostrategic interest, not to speak
of its paused clandestine nuclear weapons program.

#### US abandonment makes Israel unilaterally aggressive 

**Roth, 11/02/09**

(Ariel Ilan Roth, Executive Director of the Israel Institute and
Director of the Global Security Studies graduate program at Johns
Hopkins University Reassurance: A Strategic Basis of U.S. Support for
Israel, International Studies Perspectives, Volume 10, Issue 4, November
2009, Pages 378--393, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1528-3585.2009.00384.x)

Mearsheimer and Walt argue that the extensive support for Israel is
unjustified and counterproductive to broader U.S. foreign policy aims.
Rather than reflecting the national interest, they argue (Mearsheimer
and Walt 2007:5) that the basis for the injudicious support lies in the
efforts of the agents of domestic lobbying.1

Echoing Krasner (1978), Mearsheimer and Walt (2007:71) argue that
"America\'s major strategic interest in the Middle East is oil, and
protecting access to this commodity mainly depends on preventing any
single country from controlling the entire region." Even if one agrees,
[preventing regional hegemony is only one dimension of the threat to oil
access. Any instability in the Middle East, whether it is a regional
hegemon cornering the oil market or a different destabilizing force,
places U.S. economic and security interests in jeopardy.]{.underline}

Once it is appreciated that instability is the threat and not only
regional hegemony, [U.S. support for Israel can be more easily
understood in strategic terms: Without U.S. support, Israel\'s
self-perception of vulnerability which often drives it to unilateral
aggressive actions, has the potential to destabilize the broader region,
and endanger the secure access to oil on which the United States is
dependent. Thus, the strategic rationale behind U.S. support for Israel
can be understood in terms of restraint-inducing
reassurance.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales are stronger indication of security commitments than formal alliances- key to assurances 

**Milo et Al. 11/10/16**

(Keren Yarhi-Milo, professor of politics and international affairs at
Princeton University, Alexander Lanoszka, Professor of International
Relations at the University of Waterloo, and Zack Cooper, fellow with
the Asia team at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "To
Arm or to Ally? The Patron\'s Dilemma and the Strategic Logic of Arms
Transfers and Alliances," International Security, Volume 41 \| Issue 2
\| Fall 2016, p.90-139)

The decisions of great powers to transfer arms or form alliances often
present intriguing empirical puzzles. In 2015, the United States
supported thirty-two treaty allies and allocated billions in security
assistance worldwide. [Surprisingly, U.S. treaty allies received only 2
percent of all U.S. foreign military financing, whereas five non-allied
countries received more than 90 percent.]{.underline} [Among this group
of five non-allied U.S. partners, Israel received \$3.1 billion (55
percent of U.S. foreign military financing), Egypt \$1.3 billion (23
percent), Jordan \$300 million (5 percent), Pakistan \$280 million (5
percent), and Iraq \$250 million (5 percent)]{.underline}.2 This
variation is even more intriguing when considered historically. During
the Cold War, the United States provided weapons and alliances to many
states, including Pakistan and Taiwan, but transferred arms to Israel
without a formal defense pact. [Yet Pakistan and Taiwan eventually lost
their alliances despite seeing U.S. arms transfers continue, if not
increase.]{.underline} Why did the United States modulate its arms and
alliances provision during the Cold War? And why would it today decline
to offer some states defense pacts but give them more military financing
than it does to its treaty allies?

A patron's choice to provide arms, alliances, or both, raises academic
questions because extending alliances and transferring arms produce many
similar benefits. Both policies are useful for deterring adversaries and
reassuring clients while exerting some influence over them. [Alliances
strengthen deterrence and defense by aggregating capabilities and
enhancing combined operations and planning. Arms transfers deter and
defend by altering the local military balance.]{.underline} [Like
alliances, arms transfers can signal a patron's commitment to maintain
its client's security.]{.underline} Still, the conditions under which
great power patrons transfer arms and extend defense pacts have not been
thoroughly examined. In the relatively small literature on this topic,
[prominent scholars have argued that U.S. military assistance---arms or
alliances---to clients is driven by nonstrategic calculations, such as
domestic political factors or commercial motivations]{.underline}.3

#### **Arms key- they are material confirmation of Israel-US relations**

**Danziger and Gordon 95**

(Raphael Danziger is research and information director at the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee and editor of Near East Report, and
Bradley Gordon is legislative director at AIPAC. End American Aid to
Israel?: No, It Remains Vital by Raphael Danziger and Bradley Gordon
Middle East Quarterly September 1995, pp. 13-21)

[The \$3 billion in aid]{.underline} that the U.S. government provides
annually to Israel has come to represent the immutability of the
U.S.-Israel alliance. But the aid is much more than symbolic; it brings
very real benefits to both sides. It [serves U.S. security interests by
supporting a strategic American ally in a vital but volatile region. It
helps with the defense of Israel against the common threats of radical
Islam and international terrorism,]{.underline} enabling Israel to act
as an effective U.S. ally. [It promotes the Arab-Israeli peace process
by allowing the Israelis to take greater risks for peace.]{.underline}
[It helps the government]{.underline} of Israel to [absorb hundreds of
thousands of immigrants,]{.underline} further enhancing Israel\'s
effectiveness as a U.S. ally. Lastly, the U.S. aid to Israel is provided
to a fellow democracy that fully shares the most fundamental values of
the American people.

The cold war is over but the world remains a very dangerous place. The
United States is now the world\'s only superpower; if it does not exert
international leadership, what country will? [No other state has the
will or the capability to take on such threats as those emanating from
rogue states like Iraq, Iran, or North Korea; nor can any other deal
with issues such as the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
international terrorism, radical Islam, or international narcotics
trafficking]{.underline}. In short, American leadership is essential.

But to play this leadership role, [the U.S. government must
have]{.underline} the resources necessary to construct [a network of
allies on which it can rely]{.underline} to help counter dangers quickly
and effectively. An adequate foreign-aid program is one of these
resources. Americans provide assistance not only because they are a
generous people but because it is in their national interest to do so.
[Foreign assistance is a vital tool in strengthening bilateral relations
with allies]{.underline} and helping them better prepare themselves for
conflicts.

In particular, [whenever an ally can deal with threats]{.underline} that
endanger U.S. security interests, that [is a far less expensive
enterprise than sending in U.S. troops]{.underline}. U.S. arms supplies
to the mujahidin of Afghanistan worth only several hundred million
dollars led to the defeat of a massive Soviet force in the 1980s. U.S.
military assistance enabled Turkey to build a large army that even
without the presence of U.S. ground troops deterred a Soviet expansion
southward throughout the cold war\--at a fraction of the cost the United
States by itself would have incurred.

It may surprise many Americans to learn that foreign aid currently
represents less than 1 percent of federal spending (compared to 10
percent during the 1950s), making it a remarkably cost-effective way to
promote U.S. interests abroad. That nearly 95 percent of the military
aid and most of the economic aid are spent in the United States makes it
an even better deal.

[And if foreign aid makes sense in general, it certainly does for Israel
in particular.]{.underline}

#### **Israeli alliance key to Middle East interests and national security** 

**Danziger and Gordon 95**

(Raphael Danziger is research and information director at the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee and editor of Near East Report, and
Bradley Gordon is legislative director at AIPAC. End American Aid to
Israel?: No, It Remains Vital by Raphael Danziger and Bradley Gordon
Middle East Quarterly September 1995, pp. 13-21)

The Middle East ranks as one of the most important areas for U.S.
interests. Yet, as one of the world\'s most dangerous regions, its
stability is hardly assured. Since the end of World War II, the region
has been one of the most volatile flash points in the world,
characterized by repeated episodes of large-scale warfare, enormously
wasteful expenditures on arms and armies, threats of escalation to
involve the major powers, and the disruption of international shipping
and commerce.

Israel\'s role as a U.S. ally in this region is unique. In 1973, for
example, a U.S. air lift enabled Israel to defeat the pro-Soviet
Egyptian and Syrian armies without deployment of a single American
soldier, and at a cost to the United States of only \$2 billion. Had
American troops been required, the operation would have cost untold
lives and many more billions of dollars. As President Reagan wrote in
1979,

\"The fall of Iran has increased Israel\'s value as perhaps the only
strategic asset in the region on which the United States can rely. . . .
Israel\'s strength derives from the reality that her affinity with the
West is not dependent on the survival of an autocratic or capricious
ruler. Israel has the democratic will, national cohesion, technological
capacity and military fiber to stand forth as America\'s trusted
ally.\"^1^

Nothing has happened in the past sixteen years to detract from the
validity of this statement. Quite the contrary, Israel has proved time
and again to be indispensable for upholding vital American interests.
Through much of the cold war, Israel held pro-Soviet Arab states at bay,
helping to constrain radicals from taking over the vulnerable oil-rich
Persian Gulf states. In 1981, it destroyed Iraq\'s nuclear reactor,
saving American soldiers from having to face a nuclear-armed Iraq in
Operation Desert Storm.

The end of the cold war has increased Israel\'s value to the United
States, as the Middle East now holds out great threats and benefits for
the United States[. Israel is uniquely placed to help the United States
deal with these threats.]{.underline}

[Nuclear arms. Iran, Iraq, and Libya]{.underline}\--all rogue
states\--have active programs to develop weapons of mass destruction
(nuclear, chemical, biological), and [have sought to acquire long-range
ballistic missiles]{.underline}. The detailed briefing Secretary of
Defense William Perry received in Israel in March on Iran\'s nuclear
capabilities points to Israel\'s intelligence contribution to countering
this dangerous threat[. Israel]{.underline} [would]{.underline} most
[likely be]{.underline} the first \-- although not the only \-- [target
of Iraqi or Iranian nuclear aggression, giving it supreme motivation to
help the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [avert that
danger]{.underline}. Indeed, Israeli authorities have made clear they
will consider direct action if a nuclear threat materializes in Iran or
Iraq.

[Terrorism.]{.underline} Terrorism originating in the Middle East
reached America\'s shores in a major way in February 1993, with the
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. [Israeli law-enforcement
authorities work closely with their American counterparts to track
Middle Eastern terrorism; Israel\'s skills, location and environment
make its information on this threat of unrivaled value.]{.underline}

[Islamic radicalism]{.underline}. Islamic extremists have murdered
thousands of civilians in Algeria and threaten to take over the country,
they have also murdered foreign tourists in Egypt and terrorized
Israelis. Having lost over 120 lives last year to terrorists of Hamas,
Islamic Jihad, and Hizbullah, Israel stands at the forefront of the
battle against this scourge. [Israel invests vast resources to fight
radicalism, making the country a major partner for the United
States.]{.underline}

[Oil and gas]{.underline}. The steep decline of oil production in the
former Soviet Union has enhanced the importance of Middle Eastern oil.
[Israel continues to play an significant role in preventing the loss of
Persian Gulf oil and gas to radicals]{.underline}, be they Islamic or
secular. The conservative Arab regimes there face the same threats as
Israel \-- nuclear weapons in Iran and Iraq, terrorism, and Islamic
radicalism. [Israel\'s battle against these forces is instrumental to
preserving regional stability]{.underline}, without which the
conservative Arab regimes cannot last.

In addition to this specifically Middle Eastern role,
[Israel]{.underline} maintains a direct and close strategic cooperation
with the United States that [has been immensely useful to the U.S. armed
forces]{.underline}. It provides facilities for the storage and
maintenance of U.S. matériel for American or Israeli use in a crisis
situation at a key location. Should American military forces need to
deploy in the Middle East, [Israel has strategically located facilities
to help support American forces operating in the eastern Mediterranean,
the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, southern Europe, or the Suez
Canal.]{.underline}

Indeed, the quality of Israeli facilities and military manpower is
unsurpassed for its maintenance assistance, realistic training, and
joint exercises with U.S. armed forces. [Israel can regularly provide
target ranges and training centers as well as expertise in fighting in
extreme heat and desert conditions, advantages the U.S. armed forces
have for many years made use of through joint training maneuvers with
the Israeli armed forces]{.underline}.

Moreover, Israel has the most competent armed forces in its theater[.
Its military technology]{.underline} [and]{.underline} qualitative
[advances have contributed]{.underline} importantly [to American
capabilities]{.underline}. During Desert Storm, the U.S. Air Force
successfully relied on Israeli-designed Pioneer unmanned reconnaissance
aircraft and Israeli-made conformal fuel tanks that extended the range
of its F-15 fighters; in addition, the highly successful Tomahawk cruise
missiles included Israeli-made components. Today, the Pentagon is
procuring Hunter reconnaissance drones produced by a joint U.S.-Israel
partnership for use by the army and marines; American and Israeli
scientists are working together to develop the Arrow, one of the
world\'s most advanced tactical anti-missile missiles; and the U.S. Air
Force is using Israel\'s AGM-142 HAVE NAP missile (a highly accurate
standoff attack weapon) to enhance the B-52 bombers fleet for
conventional missions. U.S. officials publicly acknowledge the benefits
that the Arrow program has brought to America\'s ballistic-missile
defense efforts. General Malcolm O\'Neill, director of the Pentagon\'s
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, recently explained that data
gathered during Arrow tests has helped the U.S. Theater High Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD) program, especially regarding sensor technology.^2^

Israel also has great value to the United States as a port of call and
training ground for U.S. troops. Utilizing local port and training
facilities of capable allies such as Israel becomes more important as
the U.S. defense budget shrinks, the number of U.S. naval vessels
declines, and regional force-projection requirements increase.

[Israel\'s effectiveness as an American ally is directly related to U.S.
aid. Without this military assistance, Israel would be forced to
decrease its defense budget by nearly a third, seriously undercutting
its military capabilities.]{.underline} The effects on [Israel\'s
critical defense]{.underline}-related research-and-development
[activities]{.underline}, which [receive a significant proportion of
their funding from the U.S. aid]{.underline}, would be particularly
grievous. And the repayment of Israel\'s old military debts through U.S.
economic aid saves Israel from further large cuts in its military
budget. [Without America\'s assistance to Israel]{.underline}\--and the
political support underlying it\--[Israel would be hard put to preserve
an effective military deterrent to regional aggression, and the United
States would be unable to count on Israel for the many benefits of the
strategic alliance between the two countries]{.underline}.

DGP)

Seventy years after independence, Israel confronts a difficult question:
has it become so dependent on the United States that it could not
survive without it?

Let\'s start with American financial aid. To date, Israel has been the
beneficiary of approximately \$125 billion in U.S. aid, an unimaginable
sum, more than any other country since WW II, and which is slated to
further increase to some \$165 billion by the end of the new ten-year
aid package, in 2029. U.S. aid constitutes some 3 percent of Israel\'s
total state budget and about 1 percent of its GDP, a highly significant
sum, but one which it could do without if we truly wanted or had to.
Conversely, a huge uproar erupts every time the government considers a
budget cut of similar, or even smaller, proportions. Moreover, U.S. aid
constitutes some 20 percent of the total defense budget, 40 percent of
the IDF budget, and almost the entire procurement budget. There is no
alternative to U.S. aid, except at the price of a change in the national
order of priorities.

Even if we were to assume that Israel can do without U.S. financing, [no
other country would be both willing and capable of supplying us with
weapons in such quantities even if we paid cash, especially advanced
ones, like the F35]{.underline}. [There is simply no alternative to
American weapons, and our dependence on the United States is almost
complete]{.underline}; the bitter truth is that [without the United
States, the IDF would be an empty shell]{.underline}.

Furthermore, Israel\'s dependence on the United States is not limited to
financial aid and weapons sales. **[The United States provides
technologies for the development of unique weapons systems that Israel
needs, such as the Iron Dome and the Arrow rocket and missile defense
systems]{.underline}**. It mans the radar deployed in Israel which is
linked to the global American satellite system, thereby [providing us
with additional warning time before missiles from]{.underline} distant
countries, such as **[Iran]{.underline}**, hit.

The United States also cooperates with Israel in a variety of areas
related to **[counter-terrorism, the cyber threat, and prevention of the
proliferation of WMD]{.underline}**. The [United States has
prepositioned a huge store of weapons and munitions in
Israel]{.underline}, some of which are available for Israeli use, and
conducts joint military exercises with the IDF, which provide it with
the opportunity to learn some of the most advanced military tactics.
Intelligence cooperation is so broad and deep that Israel\'s
capabilities would be totally different without the United States.

On the strategic level, a deep dialogue takes place on a variety of
issues, including the Palestinians, the Iranian nuclear program, Syria,
Hezbollah, Hamas, and more. Moreover, there is a de facto U[.S. security
commitment to Israel\'s existence, which comprises an important part of
its **overall deterrence**]{.underline}. Israel may be able to face Iran
on its own, on the basis of its independent capabilities, but it is
unclear how we could handle the [nightmare scenario of a Middle East
with multiple nuclear states.]{.underline}

Imagine a [crisis between a number of nuclear states, lacking in means
of communications]{.underline} between them, some of which are extremist
and sworn to our destruction, and whose mutual relations are not much
better. The United States would have a vital role in containing a crisis
such as this and in preventing a downward spiral. The nuclear agreement
with Iran, so disparaged by our leaders, has apparently provided a
greater gain of time than any other option could have, including
military action. In so doing, it once again demonstrates [Israel\'s
great dependence on the United States]{.underline}, even in the face of
this existential threat. The [United States has also provided a
diplomatic shield from international efforts to deprive Israel of its
purported nuclear capabilities.]{.underline}

Among the world powers, only the United States seeks to promote a
settlement with the Palestinians on terms that are acceptable to most of
Israel\'s population. No other state so consistently supports Israel\'s
demands for security and recognition as the nation-state of the Jewish
people, and its opposition to the so called \"right of return.\" No
other power so consistently defends Israel in almost every international
organization and leads the battle against its delegitimization and
diplomatic isolation. We saw how the great heroes in Jerusalem trembled
when the United States merely abstained recently from a non-binding
Security Council resolution on the settlements.

The United States is Israel\'s largest trading partner, at least
partially due to the bilateral free trade agreement, the first the
United States signed with any country. Israel\'s hi-tech sector exists
and flourishes largely because of the United States.

[So maybe Israel can survive without the United States, significantly
reduce its standard of living, withdraw into itself]{.underline}. Maybe.
What is abundantly clear is that it would be a [far less
secure]{.underline} and [far poorer existence]{.underline}, with [severe
isolation]{.underline} and a lifestyle fundamentally different from that
which most Israelis have become accustomed to.

Significant changes are underway in American society that do not bode
well for the future of the bilateral relationship, inter alia, the rise
of population groups that are less identified with Israel (Hispanics,
those with no religious identification, the young) and the dwindling
numbers of the secular Jewish population, Israel\'s traditional base of
support. It is high time that our leaders finally adopt a considered and
responsible approach towards the United States, adapt our policies to
those of the United States to the extent possible, narrow and minimize
those disagreements that are truly unavoidable, and act in a serious and
cautious manner towards our great ally. It is a matter of existential
importance.

The arms trade is enormously complicated by the involvement of national
and international interests and players. Few countries can
[buy]{.underline} these increasingly costly [weapons]{.underline}
without various types of offsets.5 For instance, [**Israel**, an
important customer, has an enormous number of offset and co-production
agreements with the U.S. that **could not** easily **be** upset or
drastically **reduced without producing significant political fallout in
both countries.**]{.underline}

Budget constraints in all purchaser countries, including the United
States since the end of the Cold War, and the disappearance of the
single most dangerous potential enemy of the U.S., the Soviet Union,
have resulted in military budget cuts in the U.S. and other nations and
a consequent reduction in funds at the disposal of arms industries in
each All this refers, of course, only to conventional weapons production
and exports, not to nuclear and other weaponry of mass destruction,
which are not the subject of this article. Still, even \"conventional\"
explosives have now reached a high degree of destructiveness, as
demonstrated at the World Trade Center in New York and most recently in
Oklahoma City. The ingredients of these explosives will be difficult to
control. William Härtung, And Weapons for All (New York: Harper Collins,
1994). Offset agreements are designed to produce income for the
purchaser in order to lighten the financial burden. Co-production is a
cooperative agreement among different countries (primarily involving the
eventual purchaser of the finished product) to produce different parts
or to conduct related research, and so on. In addition, offset
agreements may have little or nothing to do with the product to be
purchased and can vary greatly by industry, ranging from agriculture to
textiles. The offset system is particularly intricate because it
consists of both direct and indirect types: direct agreements through
licensing and co-production systems and indirect agreements through
loans and grants. 184 This content downloaded from 129.170.195.144 on

https://about.jstor.org/terms Robert Neumann country. Nevertheless, the
production and export of such weapons remain highly significant to both
the U.S. and Russian economies. Although deliberate efforts have been
made, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, to disperse production over as
wide an area as possible for demographic and economic reasons, the arms
industry in the U.S. remains highly concentrated. In states like
California, the economic and political effects of declining arms
production are felt strongly. This is true to an even greater extent in
Russia, where employment in the St. Petersburg area is highly dependent
on weapons-industry exports. Sophisticated weapons systems often require
many years for design and development. Production lines for airplanes
and tanks, once closed down, are neither quickly nor easily reopened.
When private enterprise carries the brunt of such production shifts, the
reopening of such lines (once threat perceptions change) cannot be
undertaken without enormous government subsidies. Hence all producer
countries, especially Russia and the U.S., but increasingly China and
other growing secondary producers such as Brazil and India, have a
strong political interest in keeping the arms market going.

Although waves of moral indignation against weapons exports rise quite
high in the U.S. at certain times, the consequences of unilateral
control efforts can be very drastic --- and negative. In 1985,
Congressional opposition to the sale of F-15 planes to Saudi Arabia was
demonstrated largely by supporters of Israel who professed to see a
danger to the Jewish state. The Saudis, always irritated by the often
rude Congressional debate, decided to buy British Tornado planes
instead.6 The result was the [loss of a considerable number of jobs in
the U.S., while security for Israel became even more
tenuous]{.underline}. While the Saudis would have accepted some, though
not all, downgrading of the F-15s, the Tornados were delivered by
Britain without any downgrading or restrictions on their use

...

The demand for arms in Middle Eastern markets, requiring more and
increasingly sophisticated supplies, is a consequence of important
regional dynamics. **[First, there are the security problems arising
from the Arab Israeli tension. Second, there are the \"rogue states,\"
especially Iran and Iraq, but also Sudan, which are viewed as threats
throughout the area]{.underline}**. Third, there is now an increasingly
\"robust,\" or more nationalistic, Russian policy, as most recently
demonstrated in break-away Chechnya, a region mostly inhabited by
Muslims (whatever the depth of their faith). [Finally, there is the
quite different threat of **Islamic radicalism**, misnamed
fundamentalism, which might be considered the most **imminent threat to
regional stability in the Middle East**]{.underline}.14 Islamic
radicalism constitutes a special category, because it is both internal
and supranational, and arms proliferation plays only a limited role.
Such radicalism also feeds on popular frustrations caused by fiscal
constraints, which tend to force governments to reduce arms purchases
but which also result in cuts in social, health and educational
expenditures. All of the areas of potential regional conflict argue for
more, not less, conventional arms sales and make the already dim
prospects for arms control even dimmer. Many such conflicts remain while
further sources of instability are increasing all around the former
Soviet Union.

Setting aside the intrinsic desirability of controlling arms exports to
the Middle East, [what is]{.underline}, realistically, [the relationship
between such exports and threats to stability in the
region]{.underline}? In my opinion, it is only marginal, and in terms of
the Israeli-Palestinian relations and negotiations, there is none.
[Efforts to control arms exports to the Middle East do]{.underline}, of
course, [have a considerable impact on relations between Israel and the
Arab states.]{.underline} The Arab-Israeli peace process would have to
go much further and deeper than can presently be foreseen before
arms-export controls could succeed. Not only would firm peace treaties
have to be concluded, but the various Arab states and Israel would have
to become interwoven in a manner comparable to the European Union before
the fear of conflict could be banished.

Arab-Israeli War and Peace

The Arab-Israeli conflict is the oldest of the aforementioned crisis
areas and is frequently regarded as the most complex. Whether this is
still true in view of the current peace process is to be examined. If
one\'s emphasis is on arms control, there are some hopeful signs (such
as progress made in the establishment of information exchanges on arms
contracts), but it remains to be seen whether these hopeful signs will
ultimately become reality.

Without going over well-travelled ground and repeating old arguments,
one should bear in mind that this conflict consists of two interwoven
strands: ([1) the hostility toward Israel by the surrounding Arab
states; and (2) the torturous conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians, which follows a different logic]{.underline} --- one
grounded in the fact that the two parties fear and detest each other but
practically cannot live without one another. The potential for
conventional arms control has little bearing on the Israeli Palestinian
dispute, but a great deal on that between Israel and its Arab state
neighbors.

Israeli Concerns

[**Israel\'s preoccupation with security** is unlikely to diminish
anytime soon. This need is psychological more than it is
physical]{.underline}, but that does not make it any less real. A need
to feel secure is profoundly understandable for a people that [came
close to extinction in the Holocaust]{.underline} and who have lived,
ever since the creation of the Jewish state, surrounded by enemies that
have attacked or posed a serious threat to them several times. Israel\'s
drive for security has developed a quasi-religious, certainly political,
character. Security concerns are argued, time and again, in
\"worst-case\" terms, constantly creating in [Israel\'s complex,
multi-party-political scene demands for more Arab
concessions]{.underline} than can be supported by political realities
and which, therefore, can never be fulfilled (even if one leaves out
Israel\'s possession of weapons of mass destruction)

There are several additional corollaries to this situation. One is the
consequence of the Camp David Accords (1979), which made concrete the
proposition that 50 percent of U.S. foreign assistance goes to Israel
and Egypt. Add to this the fact that large conventional weapons
deliveries feed into a very large number of co-production schemes,
especially with Israel, whose high technological and scientific
knowledge is well-adapted to such intricate plans. Under these
circumstances, realistic chances for workable conventional arms-control
agreements are not exactly bright.

But that is not all. The general argument of the arms-control proponents
is that conventional arms exports to volatile regions like the Middle
East are dangerously destabilizing. This is possibly true, but the
opposite is also true, up to a point. Although **[the infusion of more
and more military material into the region]{.underline}** may heighten
interstate tension, it also **[contributes to the stability of each
regime]{.underline}**. Even in democratic Israel, [the accusation that
military preparedness had been allowed to suffer would invariably
undermine the stability of the government]{.underline}.

TEL AVIV --- The Obama administration on Tuesday increased its efforts
to
ease [Israel](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/israel/index.html?inline=nyt-geo)'s
opposition to a possible nuclear deal with Iran, as the top [American
military]{.underline} leader [assured Israeli officials that the United
States would further strengthen Israel's arsenal of arms,
warplanes]{.underline} and cybertechnology.

Israeli military officials pressed Gen. [Martin E.
Dempsey](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/martin_e_dempsey/index.html?inline=nyt-per),
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to [expand the long-term
maintenance of Israel's "qualitative military edge"]{.underline} over
regional adversaries to include not just better weaponry but also more
weaponry and training for what could be a larger Israeli defense force.

The request reflected increased [anxiety in Israel]{.underline} not only
[over]{.underline} an international nuclear pact with Iran, but also
over [increased American supplies of arms to Arab
countries]{.underline}. While these countries mistrust Iran,
historically they also have been adversaries of Israel.

Even before meeting with General Dempsey on Tuesday, Defense Minister
Moshe Yaalon of Israel expressed concern that Washington's efforts to
supply advanced arms to reassure Arab allies worried about Iran could
eventually give Israel cause for concern.

"Even if there are not now any hostile designs against us, as we know in
the Middle East, intentions are liable to change," Mr. Yaalon said at a
security conference. "The capability will without a doubt be there, and
this must be prepared for."

For Israel, that preparation is taking the form of asking the Obama
administration for more of everything, from arms to training to
cybertechnology.

"[Israel wants to make sure that we're not just helping them on the
qualitative side]{.underline}," General Dempsey told reporters traveling
with him after his meetings. "It's the notion that [size
matters]{.underline}."

Military officials said that no specific new commitments had been made,
but that the [Pentagon would continue to work with Israel to expand its
military]{.underline}.

General Dempsey said that Israel did not want just to "overmatch" Arab
states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates qualitatively.
"[They want to overmatch them in size as well,]{.underline}" he said.

At the moment, **[assurance of additional military aid is about the only
thing that Israel is getting from the United States]{.underline}**.
Relations between the two countries have been increasingly tense, as
President Obama and Prime Minister [Benjamin
Netanyahu](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/benjamin_netanyahu/index.html?inline=nyt-per) remain
at odds over an Iran nuclear agreement and over what the White House
views as Israeli intransigence on the issue
of [Palestinian](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/palestinians/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier)
statehood.

Mr. Obama last week reiterated a warning to Israel that Mr. Netanyahu's
election campaigning against a Palestinian state earlier this year may
mean that the United States will agree to resolutions in the United
Nations that are anathema to Israel. One likely possibility raised by
White House officials would be a resolution embodying the principles of
a two-state solution that would include Israel's 1967 borders, with
mutually agreed swaps of territory with the future Palestine.

"If, in fact, there's no prospect of an actual peace process," Mr. Obama
said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2, "then it becomes more
difficult to argue with those who are concerned about settlement
construction, those who are concerned about the current situation. It's
more difficult for me to say to them, 'Be patient and wait.' "

The president said that nonetheless, his commitment to Israeli security
would remain, and General Dempsey's visit was in many ways meant to
reinforce that.

Israel is already helped by a law enacted by Congress in 2008 requiring
that [arms sales allow Israel to maintain a "qualitative military
edge]{.underline}" in the region. All sales to the Middle East are
evaluated based on how they will affect [Israeli military
superiority]{.underline}. But the Obama administration has also viewed
improving the militaries of the Gulf Arab states --- those that see Iran
as a threat in the region --- as critical to Israeli security.

Gen[eral Dempsey's trip is the second by a high-ranking American
official to **reassure Israel** in the past week]{.underline}. Last
week, [John O.
Brennan](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/john_o_brennan/index.html?inline=nyt-per),
the Central Intelligence Agency director, met with Mr. Netanyahu and
other officials.

General Dempsey said he had pointed out to Israeli defense officials
that Israel was way ahead of the Gulf Arabs in the race to receive
the [F-35 fighter
jet](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/m/military_aircraft/f35_airplane/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier),
considered the jewel of America's future arsenal. The plane, one of the
world's most expensive weapons projects, has not been marketed to Arab
allies of the United States.

"I reminded my counterparts that they are on the path to have the joint
strike fighter where others in the region are not," General Dempsey
said, using another term for the F-35.

The State Department [approved]{.underline} a "Possible [Foreign
Military Sale]{.underline}" [to]{.underline} [Israel]{.underline},
according to a Defense Security Cooperation Agency press release
published on Friday.\
\
[The agency said that the Israeli government requested to purchase 13
76-mm. naval guns, as well as a variety of naval maintenance materials
and tools, technical, logistics and support services, operations and
maintenance training and other related supplies and services. The
estimated cost of such a deal is \$440 million.]{.underline}

"The [United States is committed to the security of
Israel]{.underline}," said the press release. "And it is vital to US
national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and
ready self-defense capability\... This proposed sale will contribute to
the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping
to improve the security of a strategic regional partner that has been,
and continues to be, an important force for political stability and
economic progress in the Middle East."\
\
In terms of specifics, the agency said the equipment "[will improve
Israel's capability to meet current and future threats in the defense of
its borders and territorial waters]{.underline}. The naval guns will be
installed on Israeli Navy Sa'ar-4.5 and Sa'ar-6 missile patrol boats.
One gun will be located at an Israeli naval training center to be used
for training maintenance personnel."\
\
[In September, [Israel and the US signed a defense agreement worth \$38
billion over 10
years,](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-extends-thanks-to-US-for-historic-aide-package-467730) the
largest such pledge in American history, which was hailed by both
countries as a **cornerstone of their alliance**.]{.underline}

The deal incorporates several budget lines that have previously been
negotiated and approved by Congress each year, and requires Israel to
abide by these terms over the course of the next decade, through 2029,
without further lobbying of the US legislature for additional funds.\
\
Israel will receive \$3.1b. in foreign military financing this fiscal
year, followed by \$3.3b. in subsequent years, plus \$500 million
designated to missile defense. Israel will return any money Congress may
allocate in its 2017-2018 budget for Israel beyond the \$3.1b., acting
National Security Adviser Ya'acov Nagel, who negotiated the deal on
Israel's behalf, said.

At the time of the signing, then-US president Barack Obama praised the
agreement as an example of his "[unshakable" commitment]{.underline} to
the Jewish state.\
"For as long as the State of Israel has existed, the United States has
been Israel's greatest friend and partner, a fact underscored again
today," he said.

#### Arms transfers between US and Saudi concern Israel

**Reuters 17** ("Israeli minister expresses concern over U.S.-Saudi arms
deal," May 21, 2017 --
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-israel/israeli-minister-expresses-concern-over-u-s-saudi-arms-deal-idUSKBN18H0JW)///JP

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - [Israel expressed muted concern on Sunday to a
major arms deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia announced a
day earlier during the visit to the region by U.S. President Donald
Trump.]{.underline}

The central achievement of Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia was nearly
\$110 billion in deals sealed on Saturday in which Riyadh will buy U.S.
arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as \$350
billion over 10 years.

[Although Israel also sees Iran as a threat to its security, it has a
military advantage over the Arab states and has always been concerned
about arms sales to them that could possibly narrow the margin
separating them.]{.underline}

["This is a matter that really should trouble us," said Israeli Energy
Minister Yuval Steinitz]{.underline} prior to the weekly cabinet
meeting, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no mention of
the deal in his customary public remarks.

[A senior U.S. official traveling with Trump said Washington understands
what he described as Israel's "completely legitimate" concerns and
pledged to help the Jewish state maintain its military
advantage.]{.underline}

"We're taking a whole bunch of measures, some apparent some not so
apparent, to ensure Israel's qualitative military edge. That will in no
way be compromised," the official told Reuters.

"You'll hear a really strong statement from the president on his
commitment to Israel and to Israel's defense," the official added.

Netanyahu has expressed the wish to improve ties with Saudi Arabia and
other Gulf states as part of an initiative that would draw the
Palestinians into an eventual peace deal and function as a broad front
against Iran's nuclear ambitions.

Steinitz said he hoped to hear details of the deal. Trump and his
entourage touch down in Israel on Monday.

["We have also to make sure that those hundreds of billions of dollars
of weapons to Saudi Arabia will not, by any means, erode Israel's
qualitative edge, because Saudi Arabia is still a hostile country
without any diplomatic relations and nobody knows what the future will
be," Steinitz said.]{.underline}

[In the 1980s, Israel expressed its concern at a U.S. sale to Saudi
Arabia of then-advanced F-15 fighter jets that were stationed at a Red
Sea airfield.]{.underline} But the desert kingdom has never threatened
to use them against Israel.

#### Ending US arms sales to Israel results in Israel becoming dangerous and unpredictable -- makes Middle East War highly probable

DGP)

On Tuesday [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint
session of
Congress](http://www.vice.com/read/live-watch-benjamin-netanyahus-address-to-congress-303),
and what he said was more or less what you\'d expect: Basically, Iran is
untrustworthy and dangerous, and allowing it to continue even a limited
version of its nuclear program is going to lead to an \"arms race\" in
the Middle East. The audience was dominated by
[Republicans](http://www.vice.com/tag/Republicans), and they clapped
like crazy as they listened to the speech. The fact that the speech even
happened was bananas. Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John
Boehner, who declined to ask the White House whether it would be OK for
a foreign head of state to come preach to Congress about the dangers of
the administration\'s impending nuclear deal with Iran. Obama didn\'t
meet with Netanyahu during his visit, and Democrats---including usually
staunch defenders of Israel---didn\'t hide how upset they were over the
Israeli prime minister\'s heavy-handed slight. But it was also a
powerful reminder that no matter how tense things get between the US and
Israel, it is virtually impossible to untangle the two countries or roll
back US support for Israel. According to the [Congressional Research
Service](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf), for the 2015
fiscal year the Obama administration requested \$3.1 billion in aid for
Israel from the United States Foreign Military Funding program, plus
another \$282.7 million from other funds the US pays out. And thanks to
America\'s long history of [turning loans into free
money](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2003/08/what_are_israels_loan_guarantees.html),
funds originating in the US constitute a thick slice of Israel\'s total
defense budget. So what would happen if that were all gone? It\'s not as
though the US is actually itching to cut off money. Obama is sure to
keep aid flowing for the rest of his time in office, and it\'s hard to
imagine any future president taking a harder line with Israel than he
has. But what if some irrevocable schism forced the US government\'s
hand, and the funds vanished tomorrow and never came back?

I ran the question by Rob Pinfold, former researcher at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, and a [freelance
explainer](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/11239290/Synagogue-axe-attack-why-has-violence-surged-in-Jerusalem.html) of
Israeli politics. And his answer scared the shit out of me.

VICE: Hi, Rob! What would happen if the US stopped sending money to
Israel?\
Rob Pinfold: [I think it would be a mess for Israel
basically]{.underline}.

Would it be good for the US?\
The US would have a lot less traction over Israel. It would be a
downside for the US, and it would also be a downside for the \[Middle
East\]. For a long time, the US has been trying to use its aid
politically to change Israel\'s behavior.

What behaviors wouldn\'t the US be able to control?\
I think any [**end to this aid would mean that Israel would be much more
likely to take radical moves that would not necessarily have the support
of the international community.** I think it would be
**dangerous**]{.underline}.

What are the likely events in the short term?\
I think that the big difference you\'d see straightaway is an
[escalation in settlement building because the Israeli]{.underline}
right would really be able to unleash it.

You see a lot, the Israeli government in particular, they\'ve announced
some big [settlement-building initiatives of several thousand homes in
East Jerusalem over the green line. And then the Americans say, \"Na-uh,
sorry]{.underline}, this is not happening,\" and then the idea is
quieted for another five years, and then it happens again, ad nauseam.

But [without any American influence over Israel, especially with this
aid, I think you would see a drastic exploration in settlement
building]{.underline}.

Would they attack Hamas targets in Gaza?\
I think they would need to be provoked. Very, very rarely does Israel
just willy-nilly launch itself into a conflict, not just because of
influence from the US but also at the end of the day, Israel is a
democracy---so actually instigating conflict has to have that
legitimacy, otherwise it becomes a big issue.

But what if they were provoked?\
[**Israel in the future would be much more unpredictable and any war
would be likely to go on for a lot longer,** because there wouldn\'t be
one big power to really exert the pressure and squeeze both sides into a
ceasefire]{.underline}.

And how would the US react if they couldn\'t influence them with money?\
Military action is somewhat unfeasible, in my eyes, against Israel. It
just wouldn\'t happen. You might have some sort of short-term sanctions
against the regime by the US on Israel, and maybe on other belligerents
as well.

And what would the outcome be?\
Israel wouldn\'t lose the conflict, that\'s for sure. They get a lot of
money from the States in terms of support in terms of the Iron Dome
anti-missile program, but at the end of the day they have enough
hardware already in the sheds to be able to thoroughly defeat any
belligerents---for example, non-state-level actors like [Hamas or
Hezbollah, but also state-level actors like Iran]{.underline}.

I don\'t think it would be a question of turning the tide of battle it
would just be a question of how long the war would go on, how bloody it
would be, and who would get dragged in.

Who would get dragged in?\
I think the US, even if they really fell out with and really strongly
dislike\[d\] Israel, would probably still work toward a cessation of
hostility as a superpower. I think that no matter what happens, we would
go back to some sort of paradigm representing what we have at the
moment. But the [fighting would probably be longer and bloodier, and the
**US would have less of an ability to stop it** straight
away]{.underline}.

Would Israel make moves on Iran?\
I think [the Saudis would be ready to turn a blind eye to an Israeli
attack \[on Iran\],]{.underline} which has been suggested before. So I
think again the **[probability of mass-casualty warfare and violence
would be much higher]{.underline}** if the US, tomorrow, said, \"Screw
you, guys. I\'m going home. This is too much effort.\"

What kind of warfare would we see? In terms of Iranian retaliation, Iran
has a lot of medium- to long-range missiles. They\'re not very accurate,
but they stopped firing them at the end of the Iran-Iraq war, so they do
have a very hefty stockpile that they could then fire at Israel. Israel
would inevitably retaliate with their stock. So it\'d be quite hard for
them to launch a bombing campaign against Iran because they\'d have to
go through unfriendly territory on the way. What might the targets of
Israel\'s military action be? I think you\'d see one Israeli strike, one
very pinpointed, strategic attack on Iranian nuclear assets. Then
afterwards Israel would basically try to hold its own, because Iran
would unleash its proxies on the region, which are primarily Hamas in
the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon. I think we\'d see fighting very
close to Israel\'s doorstep and I think you\'d see a lot of devastation
of both Gaza and Lebanon. But on the flip side you\'d also see a lot
more damage to Israel\'s home front than you\'ve seen in a very long
time. Would Iran have any luck? The missiles that Iran has have
overwhelmed the Iron Dome system. The Iron Dome system can shoot down
the missiles that you saw \[from\] Hamas \[during the war this past
summer\]. The Iron Dome can deal with that, but it wouldn\'t be able to
do with the stockpiles of rockets that Iran has.

Would things **[escalate]{.underline}** beyond exchanging missile
attacks?\
If there is more damage to the Israeli home front, the Israeli domestic
scene would be [more willing for the Israeli military to go all out on
flattening large parts of Lebanon and Gaza]{.underline}. There would be
much [less resistance to a ground invasion]{.underline}, and much less
resistance to moving troops in. Israel historically has very [quick
campaigns and very decisive victories]{.underline}. So I think the
**[leashes would be off]{.underline}**, so to speak. I think the Israeli
army would be going en masse into Lebanon and into Gaza and wherever
else they\'d be getting attacked from. But the fighting would be mainly
restricted to the area around Israel, unless they do some sort of
massive campaign into Iran.

Does Israel have the fire power to successfully cripple the Iranian
nuclear program? That\'s a tough one because it\'s anyone\'s guess,
really. I don\'t know exactly where and how the Iranians are hiding all
their material. They probably know. It would still be very hard for
Israel. Their planes would have to refuel in midair, in enemy territory.
Their equipment is very limited. It\'s not known if they actually have
any bunker-busting missiles, like the Americans have, that can penetrate
deep underground. I think we\'d probably have to see Israeli forces in
Iran---special forces teams, demolition teams, that kind of thing. It
would have to involve some sort of covert support from the Saudis to
have a very good chance of success. It would be very, very difficult and
it would end in a lot of casualties on both the Israeli and the Iranian
side. If the Israelis want to do it, there is nothing stopping them from
doing it. If they see them as a potential threat, they will go in and
they will go in hard.

Would the fighting be limited to just Iran, Lebanon, and Gaza?\
I think it would definitely **[trigger a whole powder keg in the entire
region]{.underline}**. You look at the Middle East today, and it\'s the
most unstable it\'s been in absolutely years. You have the Islamic State
operating out of both Iraq and Syria. They\'re making headway in Lebanon
as well. Egypt has its own problems with jihadists in the Sinai. It\'s
very unstable\... in Libya. \[And\] any conflict with Iran would not
just be limited to Gaza, it would also spread to the West Bank where
there are a lot of Iranian agents.

But in the long-term, if a terrible war weren\'t immediately sparked,
how would a halt in funding from the US affect Israel\'s military
budget? In Israel, the military budget is very much sacrosanct. Any cut
to the military budget, and you\'re putting the state in existential
danger. Personally, I think you\'d see cuts to many other social,
welfare, or educational programs within Israel before you\'d see
massive, damaging cuts to the army. They\'d try to keep the military
budget as steady as possible. So you\'d see a damaging of Israeli
society. Could Netanyahu stay in power? I personally don\'t think so. If
any Israeli leader were willing to seriously jeopardize their ties
\[with the US\], \[causing\] a complete cut off of all military and
financial aid, I personally---and I could be proven wrong---I don\'t
think the government would be able to withstand the pressure within
Israel that would result from that. What political change do you think
the country would see internally? If it happened today, I think you
would see the rise of the Labor Party in the Israeli election. What kind
of economic impact would this have on the US and other countries? I
think the US would survive. The European Union is Israel\'s biggest
trading partner, not the US. In Europe, they would cut off all money
because they have been more critical of Israel than the US has been,
traditionally. I think the crisis would be more on Israel\'s side than
on Europe or the US. Is there a possibility that any of Israel\'s
enemies would look more favorably on the US\'s presence in the region? I
don\'t think that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria would be welcoming
the US, and developing ties with Uncle Sam\... Well, not them\... It
might make a difference. It might make some sort of short-term blip, but
I think the countries in the Arab world have enough reasons to be mad at
the US the next day for whatever reason. But speaking of the Islamic
State, would they make a move? I doubt that. They talk a lot about Jews
in the world, and Jewish money, and Jewish power, and how much they hate
Israel. But generally they have very little to actually do with Israel,
in terms of fighting or invading Israel. They go for Jewish targets but
they\'re not so much in the movement against Israel itself. In any
one-on-one confrontation between the Islamic State and Israel, Israel
would completely wipe the floor with them.

On a strategic level those changes create greater uncertainty about how
the United States and Israel cooperate to secure their interests and
confront common challenges. More often than in the past, [Israelis and
Americans see both the politics and policies of the other undermining
their strategic interests. These trends **erode mutual trust**,
deepening America's doubts of Israel's strategic value while reinforcing
**Israeli fears about U.S. commitments to its security**. **Distrust
creates uncertainty, causing each side to act more unpredictably in
order to secure its own interests**.]{.underline} The depth of strategic
challenges facing both allies raises the stakes, further highlighting
the diverging ways in which most Americans and Israelis see the world
amid the tectonic changes occurring in the Middle East. Ignoring these
perceptions only creates more friction and unpredictability, pointing to
more turbulent times ahead.

Whatever Israel's unease about U.S. strategy, however, there is simply
[no substitute for U.S. leadership in the Middle East]{.underline} in
the foreseeable future. Israel has few options for steering a different
course. It will continue trying to influence the shape of U.S. Middle
East policies, but its ability will remain limited especially if
Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy stays frozen. Rather than expect that the
United States will neutralize the Iranian threat, Israel will have to
adapt and work within a broader U.S. containment security architecture,
regardless of the drawbacks of such a framework. Even though many
Israelis and Israel's supporters would like to believe that U.S.
military power can solve Israel's most pressing problems if properly
applied, ultimately the United States can only help Israel manage its
threats and challenges; it cannot provide solutions.

It is unrealistic to expect U.S. and Israeli interests to be completely
aligned. As a small country in a constant state of war, Israel's
perceptions, threat assessments, and strategies for pursuing its
interests naturally differ from those of a global superpower. Yet,
common cause and understandings on key issues are vital for a healthy
alliance. Without a common mission and purpose to guide the U.S.-Israeli
partnership, the relationship will continue drifting, and disagreements
on key strategic challenges will threaten the interests of both allies.
Today not only is there no common vision and strategy, but Israeli and
U.S. policies seem to be working at cross-purposes on key issues.
Israeli and U.S. policymakers at the highest levels should outline a
common vision to ensure a lasting partnership that effectively addresses
their most important challenges. This has to start with a commitment by
leaders on both sides. Formulating a common mission is a shared project.
Yet the burden is largely on Israel to adapt to new strategic and
political realities because Israel has the most at stake in the
partnership as well as the most to lose from its deterioration. As
former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy has written, "in order to become a
valuable ally, Israel has had to seek and nurture assets and
capabilities of its own, of such caliber as to impress upon Washington
that not only was the State of Israel here to stay, but that its
activities and influence would stand the U.S. in good stead."1 To 11
successive U.S. presidents, Israel's leadership has successfully
articulated a strategy and vision that both complemented broader U.S.
goals and made Israel a vital component of pursuing those objectives.
Israel's leadership needs to urgently restore that vital link and
connection. The goal is all the more important because the United States
has been struggling to articulate a coherent set of policies to address
the tectonic shifts under way in the Middle East since the fall of
President Hosni Mubarak in early 2011. To preserve the vitality of the
U.S.-Israeli partnership, Israel should adapt and make itself
indispensable in helping pursue U.S. objectives in an evolving Middle
East strategic environment. Without a clearer Israeli strategy of how
Israel fits into the Key Findings and Recommendations 105 U.S. vision of
the Middle East, the partnership will continue to drift, with unforeseen
consequences for both the United States and Israel. Of utmost importance
for strengthening the sense of U.S.-Israeli partnership is a practical
strategy to address the Palestinian issue. It is difficult to see how
U.S.-Israeli ties can improve without fundamental Israeli commitments
toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Reaching an agreement
with the Palestinians will neither transform the Middle East nor solve a
host of challenges facing the United States and Israel, including
extremism, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. An Israeli-Palestinian
agreement would, however, relieve one set of grievances out of many in
the region. It would also remove a key issue of contention that has
complicated U.S. management of the Middle East, which will only become
more complicated as populations in the region demand greater
representation and an end to authoritarian rule. The problem is that the
prospect of reaching an agreement under the current circumstances is
low. This poses a significant dilemma for both the United States and
Israel, because without resolving the problem or at least making some
progress, U.S.-Israeli ties will likely suffer and the international
drive to delegitimize Israel will intensify. Although the Palestinian
issue remains a source of bilateral tension with few signs of progress,
an Israeli-Syrian political agreement could significantly alter the
current course of U.S.-Israeli dynamics and strengthen strategic
cooperation. Past discussions of an Israeli-Syrian agreement included
concrete U.S. security guarantees, which would likely be required for
any future agreement. Many obstacles remain to such an agreement,
including domestic upheaval against the Assad regime in Syria and
Israeli opposition, but an Israeli-Syrian agreement could have a
dramatic impact on the Middle East strategic environment, giving the
U.S.-Israeli partnership a new sense of purpose. As Middle Eastern
regimes adjust to demands for greater representation, maintaining
regional stability will become more challenging. Israel's place in these
broader regional changes is important, not because it is at the center
of Arab public discourse, but because the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
will continue plaguing U.S. efforts to manage a range of tasks in the
Middle East. Future Arab governments will be more attuned to public
perceptions, and Arab pressure groups are unlikely to remain as
accommodating of Israel as they have been, as Egypt's decision to broker
a fragile Hamas-Fatah agreement and open the Gaza border after a nearly
five-year closure clearly demonstrates. 106 Crossroads: The Future of
the U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership I s r ael and the U nited S tates
S h o uld C la r if y C o mmitments and Resp o nsibilities o f the Pa r
tne r ship As part of a broader effort to rebuild trust, the United
States and Israel should use the U.S.-Israel Strategic Dialogue to
discuss frankly each ally's commitments and responsibilities in order to
address the deep uncertainties on both sides. Today the depth of
U.S.-Israeli militaryto-military cooperation is unprecedented. Yet in
the current political and strategic climate, vague verbal declarations
about America's "commitment to Israel's security" have become slogans
rather than a formula for practical security arrangements. U.S.
politicians and government officials will continue using such mottoes
for political gain, but overusing them may exacerbate Israeli anxiety
because their vagueness is subject to such wide interpretation.
Clarifying contingencies that may require U.S. intervention or
coordinated military action, most importantly regarding Iran, is highly
sensitive but could add an important element of certainty to the
relationship. Some Americans have argued that extending a U.S. nuclear
deterrent to Israel would relieve Israeli anxiety of a nuclear Iran.
Others have suggested a bilateral defense treaty. Neither, however,
provides solutions to Israel's strategic challenges, which are a
daunting mixture of hard security threats from states and nonstate
actors combined with the psychological and diplomatic threat of growing
international isolation. The U.S. government can address Israeli anxiety
and uncertainty, to at least some extent, by clarifying the meaning of
existing U.S. security guarantees, including a deeper discussion about
how Israel's conventional capabilities match its threats. Israel's
responsibilities as an ally require clarification as well. For the sake
of the United States and its own interests, the Israeli government
should identify and articulate how its policies and actions contribute
to U.S. interests in the Middle East and globally, beyond military and
counterterrorism cooperation. Those elements of cooperation remain
important, but Israel should demonstrate to the United States that it is
a net asset in other ways as well. Most important, it should seek to
ensure that it is a force for stability in the region by working toward
an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, calibrating its use of force, and
striving to improve its ties with other U.S. allies such as Turkey and
Gulf Arab states. Key Findings and Recommendations 107 Progress toward
these aims requires not only internal deliberations in Israel and the
United States but a frank bilateral dialogue. For all of the high-level
interactions, visiting official delegations, and close consultation on
key issues, the quality of dialogue on sensitive issues affecting the
partnership has deteriorated significantly. Most politically sensitive
issues are either deferred or addressed only superficially. As close
partners, Israel and the United States should strengthen the current
U.S.-Israel Strategic Dialogue framework to address both the immediate
and the long-range issues that confront the partnership. A more
transparent and honest discussion of future constraints and commitments
could ease some doubt and rebuild trust. I s r ael and the U nited S

Changes under way in Israel, the United States, and the Middle East
ensure that the future will be different from the past. U.S. assistance
and support for Israel over the decades have helped transform Israel
into a powerful regional force and helped the United States promote
regional stability for decades. Yet looking forward there is no
guarantee that the United States will be able or willing to maintain the
current level of support indefinitely. In the overall U.S. budget
picture and U.S. expenditures in the Middle East, the amount of aid
Israel receives seems inconsequential. Yet, in a fiscal environment
where the U.S. government is debating cutting \$4 trillion in spending
over the next decade, and even the U.S. military is not immune to budget
cuts, it is shortsighted for Israel to expect current aid levels to
remain untouched over the long term. Although **[U.S. military aid is
reassuring]{.underline}**, especially given the unprecedented [threats
Israel faces]{.underline}, many Israelis, inside and outside of
government, question whether the current level of assistance is
sustainable in the long term. U.S. aid was crucial for transforming
Israel several decades ago, yet today it has become a symbol of
**[Israeli dependence]{.underline}**.

Some level of **[interdependency is unavoidable and even mutually
beneficial]{.underline}**. U[.S. military aid strengthens Israel's
deterrence against regional armies]{.underline}. Strong military ties
and aid also lower the risk that the Israel Defense Forces will take
unilateral actions that undermine U.S. interests. Yet under shifting
political and geopolitical circumstances, U.S. military and political
assistance ultimately undermines Israel's long-term autonomy and ability
to manage its own defense needs. The challenge is to maintain a degree
of interdependence that is mutually beneficial rather than a partnership
that reinforces Israel's dependence on the United States.

[Israeli military **imports**]{.underline}---particularly in the realm
of fighter aircraft and missile/missile defense technology---**[remain
almost exclusively American]{.underline}**. [**U.S. arms exports**,
funded at least in part by large amounts of U.S. aid, help maintain
Israel's military advantage over its neighbors]{.underline} (see

depth and breadth of U.S.-Israel ties.]{.underline}** Moreover,
[Israel]{.underline} is a consortium partner in the development of the
F-35 aircraft and recently [became the first country outside the United
States to receive F-35s.]{.underline} 36 The probability of continued
[**Israeli reliance on U.S. weapons** and defense technology was
demonstrated in the memorandum of understanding (MOU) the two countries
concluded in September 2016]{.underline}. Under the terms of that MOU,
which is the third between the two countries, the executive branch
committed to request that Congress provide \$38 billion in military aid
over 10 years, from FY2019 to FY2028. (For more information on the MOU
and its terms, see CRS Report RL33222, U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel, by
Jeremy M. Sharp). Most of Israel's other major purchases made in recent
years have been from Western European suppliers, including a 2012 deal
with Italy for 30 M-346 jets, worth around \$1 billion (the final planes
were delivered in July 2016).37 [Israel has an active and growing
indigenous arms industry]{.underline}, the development of which has been
subsidized in part by U.S. support. Since FY1984, Israel has been
allowed to spend a portion of its U.S. Foreign Military Financing (FMF)
assistance on arms produced by Israeli manufacturers (known as Off-Shore
Procurement, or OSP).38 Israel is unique in this regard---no other FMF
recipient can use any of the FMF for domestic procurement.

#### Reducing arm sales to Israel breaks our legal commitment to supply Israel with a qualitative military edge.

Research Service, "Arms Sales in the Middle East: Trends and Analytical
Perspectives for U.S. Policy,"
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44984.pdf)

The term "qualitative military edge" ([QME]{.underline}) was embraced by
the Reagan Administration and its successors to [refer to the advantage
in military technology that Israel]{.underline}, with a smaller
territory and population than some of its historical adversaries, [seeks
to maintain]{.underline}. 88 The concept stems from traditional security
concerns about Israel's Arab neighbors, with whom Israel engaged in
numerous conflicts over the course of several decades. No formal
definition in law existed until [lawmakers codified U.S. support for
Israel's QME as U.S. policy in 2008]{.underline} (P.L. 110-429,§201). 89
That legislation requires that any proposed U.S. arms sale to "any
country in the Middle East other than Israel" must include a
notification to Congress with a "determination that the sale or export
of such would not adversely affect Israel\'s qualitative military edge
over military threats to Israel." [It defines QME as the ability to
counter and defeat any credible conventional military threat from any
individual state or possible coalition of states]{.underline} or from
non-state actors, while sustaining minimal damages and casualties,
[through the use of superior military means, possessed in sufficient
quantity, including weapons, command, control, communication,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities that in
their technical characteristics are superior in capability]{.underline}
to those of such other individual or possible coalition of states or
non-state actors.

JERUSALEM --- 

In a break from traditional Israeli opposition to U.S. arms sales to
Saudi Arabia, [Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Sunday that his country
understood Washington's plan to supply state-of-the-art weapons to
Riyadh as a counterweight to Iranian influence.]{.underline}

Aware of Israel's sensitivity about arms sales in the region, the United
States is also offering a sharp increase in military aid to Israel and
has assured it that it will retain a fighting edge over its neighbors,
he added.

"[We understand the need of the United States to support the Arab
moderate states, and there is a need for a united front between the U.S.
and us regarding Iran," Olmert said]{.underline} at a weekly Cabinet
meeting.

The rare agreement reflects **[shared U.S. and Israeli concern over the
potential threat from Iran if it acquires nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**.

The proposed deal includes advanced weaponry and air systems that would
greatly enhance the striking ability of Saudi warplanes.

One Israeli hard-liner warned that Saudi Arabia could be taken over by
extremists. Israel's southern tip is about 10 miles from Saudi Arabia on
the Gulf of Aqaba. The proposed package comes with a 25% increase in
U.S. military aid to Israel, from an annual \$2.4 billion to \$3 billion
a year, guaranteed for 10 years. Olmert said the increase in military
aid would assure Israel's strategic superiority.

#### Israel feels comforted by arms sales to GCC countries 

**Hudson, 05/13/15**

(John Hudson, Foreign Policy correspondent, "Israel: Go Ahead and Give
the Gulfies Guns,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/13/israel-go-ahead-and-give-the-gulfies-guns/)
ZFO

According to an official with the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee --- the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying organization in the
U.S. --- the group is not trying to lobby Congress to block arms deals
with the Gulf. The Israeli government has also refrained from weighing
in, according to Hill staffers who maintain routine contacts with the
Israelis.

"Israelis have been silent," said a congressional aide familiar with the
issue. "AIPAC was asking a lot of questions, but I wouldn't characterize
our interactions on this as lobbying."

One reason, [according to State Department]{.underline} and
congressional sources, is that [the]{.underline} Obama [administration
is carefully assessing how it can help Gulf allies deter a threat from
Iran without overstepping Israel's Qualitative Military
Edge]{.underline} (QME), a calculus the executive branch is required by
law to take into account as it licenses the transfer of weapons to
Middle East governments.

[Another reason for Israel's relaxed temperament is its newfound kinship
with Arab countries who share its concerns about Iran's rise in the
region.]{.underline} "The Israelis have cared less about the deals
happening this week [because there's a feeling in Israel that they now
have an undeclared ally in the GCC against Iran,"]{.underline} said
David Ottaway, a Gulf expert at the Wilson Center, using an acronym for
the six countries that makeup the Gulf Cooperation Council.

But satisfying all sides equally is easier said than done --- and at
least [some of the top weapons systems on the GCC wish list are not
expected to be supplied due to QME considerations, including the F-35
Lightning II, a "fifth-generation" fighter jet designed to be virtually
invisible to enemy radar, and BU-28 bunker buster bombs, which
Washington has only provided to Israel]{.underline}. Instead, [the Gulf
countries are likely to walk away with promises to expedite the
transfers]{.underline} of long-sought munitions and radar equipment.

### 2NC- Link Extension- US key to prevent war 

#### Despite lobbying, US prevents Israel-Iran war 

**Giraldi, 05/15/12**

(Philip Giraldi, a former CIA officer and executive director of the
Council for the National Interest and a contributing editor to The
American Conservative, "Lobbying for War," Washington Report on Middle
East Affairs,
<https://www.wrmea.org/012-may/two-views-who-wants-war-with-iran.html>)

AIPAC has also been effective in lining up Capitol Hill in its support.
One-third of Congress attended the AIPAC conference, and a number of
individual legislators have been actively promoting the lobby\'s line.
Sen. Carl Levin \[who has received more pro-Israel PAC contributions
than any other member of Congress---ed.\] is now calling for a military
blockade of Iran, a clear act of war. [Thirty-two senators,]{.underline}
including Lindsey Graham, John McCain and Joe Lieberman, [are supporting
legislation that will essentially authorize taking military action
against Iran because it has the \"capability\" to create a nuclear
weapon, a line that has already been crossed by Tehran as well as by
other states in the region,]{.underline} including Turkey, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia. Why pick on Iran? Because [that is what Israel
wants]{.underline} (Israel, one might add, has, unlike Iran, attacked a
number of its neighbors in recent years[). Israel also possesses its own
secret nuclear arsenal, giving it a combination of political
recklessness and potentially cataclysmic military power that apparently
causes no heartburn in Congress.]{.underline}

It is being argued in some circles that [Obama has been resisting the
Israeli drive to go to war because his defense and intelligence chiefs
insist that the \"red line\" with Tehran is the actual possession of a
nuclear weapon,]{.underline} but is that really true? He has muddied
that apparent position by insisting that he will \"prevent\" the
Iranians from obtaining the bomb. Prevention means pre-emption, possibly
based on the same type of fabricated intelligence Americans saw in the
lead-up to Iraq. To be sure, the Pentagon and the intelligence community
are undeniably cool on the prospect of a new war in the Middle East,
understanding clearly that the unintended consequences after the last
bomb is dropped could be devastating to the economy and to the
sustainability of the remaining American presence in places like
Afghanistan. [Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey has been active in
trying to persuade the Israelis to defer action, stating both that Iran
is a \"rational actor\" and that a war right now would serve no one\'s
interest.]{.underline} For his pains, Dempsey has been called everything
short of an idiot and his judgment has been denounced by strategic
geniuses such as Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. In truth, Iran has
been demonized to a point where it is difficult to imagine any
nonviolent way out of the current contretemps.

## Answers to: 

### 2NC- AT- Israel won't strike first 

#### Israel is not afraid to strike first

#### Horshig, 06/20/19

(Doreen Horschig, PhD Candidate in Security Studies, University of
Central Florida, "Israel could strike first as tensions with Iran
flare", The Conversation,
https://theconversation.com/israel-could-strike-first-as-tensions-with-iran-flare-119146)

Iran shot down a U.S. drone on June 19, further escalating tensions
between Iran and its adversaries.

Relations with Iran have been worsening for months. In early May, one
year after the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal negotiated
in 2015 between Iran, the U.S., the European Union and five other
countries, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that his country may
also withdraw from the agreement, which limits its ability to develop
nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting sanctions.

In June, [Rouhani announced that Iran will restart uranium enrichment,
which could put the country on track to develop a nuclear weapon within
a year]{.underline}. Rouhani's government insists its uranium will go to
civilian nuclear power, not weapons.

As a "deterrent" to Iran, the United States is sending an additional
1,000 troops to the Middle East.

[The U.S. is not the only country considering a military response in
Iran.]{.underline}

["Israel will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons," said Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu]{.underline} on June 17. Netanyahu
also said Iran must be punished for violating the nuclear agreement.

[Israel,]{.underline} which has faced threats to its national security
since its founding as a Jewish homeland in the Middle East in 1948, [is
known to take aggressive, preventive action to protect itself --
including by launching preemptive strikes on neighboring nations it
perceives as threatening.]{.underline}

[If international relations with Iran grow more volatile, Israel could
take dramatic, unilateral action against its neighbor and longtime
adversary.]{.underline}

How the Begin Doctrine justifies preemptive strikes

I'm an international security scholar who studies Israel's proactive use
of its military to prevent nuclear buildup in the Middle East.

[Israel has a counterproliferation policy, called the Begin Doctrine,
which allows it to wage preventive strikes against enemies with weapons
of mass destruction programs. Using the Begin Doctrine as a
justification for preemptive strikes, the Israeli government has for
decades quietly decimated nuclear and chemical facilities across the
Middle East.]{.underline}

When President Saddam Hussein's potential nuclear military ambitions
raised concerns [in 1981, the Israeli government destroyed an Iraqi
nuclear reactor in a surprise attack called Operation
Opera.]{.underline}

"On no account shall we permit an enemy to develop weapons of mass
destruction against the people of Israel," a government release stated
at the time. "We shall defend the citizens of Israel in good time and
with all the means at our disposal."

In 2007, Israel responded to Syria's failure to report its uranium
processing by striking a nuclear reactor in the Deir ez-Zor region. The
United States, which was reportedly informed ahead of the attack, made
no effort to stop Israel.

Israel has also been accused of sponsoring the assassinations of at
least four Iranian nuclear scientists since 2010. The incidents have
never been fully investigated, and Israel has neither confirmed nor
denied responsibility for the targeted killings.

Israel has also deterred nuclear proliferation in the Mideast using less
lethal, more high tech strategies.

#### No link- Israel is cautious of Saudi arms sales

https://www.jta.org/2017/05/30/politics/trump-wants-to-sell-lots-of-weapons-to-saudi-arabia-why-are-israel-and-its-friends-keeping-quiet)

[It's long been pro-Israel doctrine that]{.underline} an Israeli
military capability sufficient to defeat enemies is not enough, [that
there needs to be enough of a gap between Israel's capabilities and
those of its enemies to prevent an outbreak of war]{.underline}.

In 1982, the Israeli ambassador to Washington, [Moshe Arens, bluntly
warned that the arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Arab states would
"erase" Israel's qualitative military edge]{.underline}.

[After Trump announced the new sales to Saudi Arabia, Israel's energy
minister, Yuval Steinitz, delivered a similar warning.]{.underline}

"[We have also to make sure that those hundreds of billions of dollars
of weapons to Saudi Arabia will not, by any means, erode Israel's
qualitative edge]{.underline} because Saudi Arabia is still a hostile
country without any diplomatic relations and nobody knows what the
future will be," he said, according to Newsweek.

#### **Israel relies on the US to make change in the Iran conflict** 

**Shupak, 06/11/19**

(Greg Shupak, Teacher of Media Studies at University of Guelph in
Canada, "Why Israel wants Iran Destroyed," The Electronic Intifada,
<https://electronicintifada.net/content/why-israel-wants-iran-destroyed/27531>)

[The US government is prosecuting an economic war on Iran while
intensifying its military posture against the country]{.underline},
increasing land, sea and air positions on the basis of unsubstantiated
claims that Iran might someday develop nuclear weapons, is the engine of
violence in the Middle East, [and is likely to initiate attacks against
US "interests" or those of its proxies.]{.underline}

Such maneuvers must be understood in the context of the ways that Iran
has functioned as an obstacle to US ruling class goals in the Middle
East, a view shared by the Israeli ruling class for its own interests.

U[S and Israeli planners despise Iran principally because it is an
independent regional power. It has a strong military and a foreign
policy that includes providing material support for armed Palestinian
resistance to Israel and for Hizballah's defense of Lebanon from
US-Israeli aggressions,]{.underline} including the joint invasion in
1982 and the US-backed Israeli assault in 2006.

Iran's support was crucial to help Hizballah resist the US-backed
Israeli occupation of the country.

[Though in recent years Israel has come close to attacking Iran
militarily and suggested in February that the US do so, it appears that
for the moment Israel would prefer that the US not bomb or invade Iran
because Hizballah would be able to inflict significant damage on Israel
in response.]{.underline}

[Instead Israel is hoping that Iran will be subjected to enough
socioeconomic asphyxiation that its government will be overthrown or it
will be subjected to even greater outside control than it was under the
nuclear dea]{.underline}l -- a deal that Iran has abided by and from
which the US pulled out last year.

Iran now says that, if sanctions continue to prevent it from profiting
from its natural resources, it will also withdraw from the accord.
