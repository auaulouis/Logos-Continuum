Cutting Military Aid to Lebanon Would Be a Mistake. July 27, 2018.

Notwithstanding the new environment, [[I suspect Washington will not end
or make]{.mark} major [cuts in military aid to Lebanon]{.mark} any time
soon]{.underline}. That's primarily because President Donald Trump is
not in a position to pick a fight with the generals, which would
introduce unwanted political turbulence to a foreign policy team that
has already come under a lot of pressure. Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis, along with the Joint Chiefs and CENTCOM Commander Joseph Votel,
is a strong advocate of the program.

The Pentagon holds the view that if Washington stops the aid, it would
lose a major point of access to the Mediterranean and forfeit the
largest investment it has ever made in Lebanon. The United States also
would effectively cede the country to Iran, which is dying to see the
Americans leave, and invite Russia, which is chomping at the bit to get
its hands on the Lebanese military and ultimately expand its regional
presence at the expense of U.S. interests. Finally, the United States
would abandon a dependable military partner who has done a superior job,
thanks to U.S. support, battling ISIS and al-Qaeda.

But [**[there's]{.mark}** also [a **broader political consideration**
here]{.mark}]{.underline} by the Administration. [[If the White House
does **open this can of worms** and starts more aggressively]{.mark}
[**questioning** the **value** of **U.S. military aid**]{.mark} to
Lebanon]{.underline}, [**[no security assistance]{.mark}** program [in
the **Middle East or elsewhere** **will be safe**]{.mark} on Capitol
Hill]{.underline}. [[This would **cause alarm bells to ring**]{.mark} in
the Pentagon]{.underline}, which could lead to a political showdown with
the Administration.

**Foreign perception is [especially true]{.underline} in

other allies]{.underline} -- abandonment increases risk of
[defection]{.underline} *if* the trends continue**

Further, [[**Trump's criticism of allies** has]{.mark} also [**damaged

said that Trump's foreign policy decisions had "pressed fast-forward on
the decline of the United States."6 One South Korean publisher wrote an
op-ed in The New York Times stating that "it now looks like America
could bring our doom."7 Japanese foreign policy commentator Yoichi
Funabashi said, "The U.S. withdrawal from T.P.P. was the biggest shock
to the alliance since Nixon went to China."8 The list goes on. [[As the

Japanese and Korean acceptance of U.S. nuclear primacy and a U.S.

**No allied proliferation now\
Lanoszka 6/11** (Alexander Lanoszka -- Assistant Professor in the
Department of Political Science and Fellow in the Balsillie School of
International Affairs at the University of Waterloo, 6-11-2019, \"False
Alarm? Donald Trump, Alliances and Nuclear Proliferation,\" EastWest
Institute,
https://www.eastwest.ngo/idea/false-alarm-donald-trump-alliances-and-nuclear-proliferation)

Some observers argue the prospects for nuclear proliferation among U.S.
allies appear to have heightened in recent years. Superficially, U.S.
President Donald Trump may be responsible. During his 2016 presidential
campaign, he made statements suggesting he might tolerate efforts by
Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. His criticisms of NATO
and some of its members have fueled debate in Germany on the
desirability and feasibility of the "nuclear option." Looking more
broadly, since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. has had to grapple
with the management of its security ties abroad amid mounting budgetary
deficits and growing public weariness of so-called "forever wars." [And
yet, over two years into the Trump administration, [little nuclear
proliferation]{.mark}-related activity [seems to be taking place among
U.S. allies.]{.mark} In fact, some of [the most powerful]{.mark} U.S.
allies---[Japan and Germany]{.mark}---have largely [moved away from
nuclear energy]{.mark}. What lies behind this current scenario? Perhaps
one answer is that the U.S military deployments that underscore [U.S.
security commitments remain strong]{.mark}.]{.underline} But how do
security guarantees relate to nuclear proliferation? Presidential
rhetoric may be important for evaluating the strength of a treaty pledge
by the U.S. to defend an ally in the event of attack by a potential
adversary like Russia, North Korea or China. However, whether it is more
important than other considerations is debatable, since presidential
rhetoric may simply be just that: rhetoric. A verbally cited promise to
follow through on any pledges recorded in print is simply hard to
believe. No country wants to risk the safety of his or her country's
cities for an ally, if they can help it. How can a state, therefore,
have any sort of confidence in its alliances? Thankfully, there is a
way. [The U.S. deploys a wide range of military forces to shore up local
defense and deterrence measures to augment the security of its allies
and to advance its own national security interests. U.S. forces
stationed in South Korea and Japan, for example, are there for regional
contingency if North Korea and/or China were to commit an act of
aggression---not to serve as potential targets to trigger wider
retaliation by Washington, per the logic of trip-wires.]{.underline}
They are also there to kill, making it hard for any potential aggressor
to go successfully on the attack without incurring unacceptable costs.
So long as the U.S. has such forces on its ally's territory, or in the
theater of operations where a potential war would be fought, the
security guarantee is sufficiently strong to have the confidence of its
beneficiaries. [[It is when the U.S. has]{.mark} unilaterally
[reduced]{.mark} its forward [deployments that]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark} [become]{.mark} so alarmed they are [tempted to acquire
nuclear weapons to ensure their]{.mark} own [security]{.mark}. A case in
point is South Korea in the 1970s. As it does now, South Korea benefited
from a treaty promising that Washington would defend it against external
aggression. But when President Richard Nixon came into office in 1969,
he spoke of how partners in East Asia and elsewhere would need to bear
more of the collective defense burden, especially in light of its
failures in Vietnam, rising anti-war sentiment at home and the downturn
in the U.S. economy. Yet, the South Korean President at the time---Park
Chung-hee---was unfazed by Nixon's rhetoric. He believed that the United
States would reward his country for its contributions in the Vietnam War
by retaining its large military presence on the Korean Peninsula.
President Park's optimism was misplaced. In July 1970, Nixon announced
that the U.S. would unilaterally withdraw 20,000 of its military
personnel from South Korea within a year, cutting the total U.S.
military presence on the peninsula by one-third.]{.underline} The
balance of power implications were potentially significant. Since more
troop reductions were now conceivable, South Korea would become newly
vulnerable to North Korea---an adversary that, at the time, was
relatively more industrialized, enjoyed Chinese and Soviet patronage,
had a stronger conventional military and had engaged in highly
provocative but low-level military activities across the Demilitarized
Zone against the South since 1966. [Against this backdrop, President
Park put South Korea on the path towards acquiring nuclear weapons. This
project failed partly because South Korea needed outside sources for
credit and access to reprocessing and enrichment facilities---a
vulnerability that the United States used to its advantage to get its
ally to curb its activities and to make nonproliferation commitments.
Still, South Korea has had persistent interest in fissile materials
since the 1970s and continues to undertake continued pyroprocessing
activities.]{.underline} Today, South Korea may not be on an aggressive
path to acquiring nuclear weapons, but its apparent desire to seek some
advantage demonstrates that security guarantees---once broken---can be
very difficult to repair, thus prompting countries to reconsider the
nuclear option. [The South Korean case illuminates why [we are seeing no
new efforts to get nuclear]{.mark} [weapons,]{.mark} at least [by
U.S.]{.mark} treaty [allies, in the age of Trump]{.mark}. When one looks
beyond the rhetoric, actions speak volumes. [The Trump]{.mark}
[administration has reinforced U.S. force posture]{.mark} with
additional deployments to Germany. It is seriously considering a
permanent military presence in neighboring Poland. Present relations
with South Korea have been rocky, but the Trump administration did sign
an updated free trade agreement, as well as a temporary agreement, to
help cover the costs of 28,500 military personnel stationed
there.]{.underline} The U.S. military presence in Japan has remained
steady. Indeed, if Trump is serious about containing China, the U.S.
military presence will likely increase in East Asia over the long-term.
[Dramatic, unilateral troop withdrawals under the Trump administration
are still possible, but the historical record indicates that such
attempts are generally made early in a presidency rather than later.
Nixon, for instance, announced his troop withdrawal out of Vietnam
within eighteen months of coming into office. Putting all rhetoric
aside, if the military foundations of U.S. security guarantees remain
strong, [nuclear proliferation among allies remains
unlikely]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[These [worries are unwarranted: NATO]{.mark} at 70 [is actually in
remarkably good shape.]{.mark} Yes, European allies have been laggards
on defense spending, and some members---Hungary, Poland, and Turkey in
particular---have tarnished democratic credentials. But [NATO has
demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to]{.mark} the [changing
geopolitical environment]{.mark} since the Cold War's end, [ensuring
that the United States and Europe remain each other's]{.mark} go-to
[partners]{.mark}.]{.underline} The alliance opened its doors to the new
democracies that emerged from the former Soviet bloc, helping to anchor
security and democracy in a wider Europe. Since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine in 2014, members have taken important steps to strengthen
deterrence against the Kremlin's adventurism[. [NATO has struck
partnerships]{.mark} across the globe [and carried out]{.mark} ambitious
[missions]{.mark} well beyond the territory of member states---[most
notably in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya]{.mark}. All the while,
the alliance has [retooled to]{.mark} address [new hazards such as
cyberthreats, terrorism, hybrid warfare, and migration]{.mark}.
Precisely because [NATO has been]{.mark} so [nimble and effective, it
enjoys strong political support on both sides of the Atlantic,]{.mark}
leaving Trump virtually alone as a vociferous critic. Moreover---and
[paradoxically---Trump's]{.mark} withering [attacks on the alliance are
actually strengthening]{.mark} NATO. [Defenders]{.mark} of the alliance
[are coming out]{.mark} of the woodwork, [especially in]{.mark} the U.S.
[Congress]{.mark}.]{.underline} Trump's regular haranguing of allies for
insufficient defense spending is paying off: Europeans are finally
investing more in their militaries, making it only more likely that the
United States will cleave to Europe as its partner of choice. [And
[Trump's skepticism toward NATO]{.mark} expansion [could]{.mark} help
[resolve]{.mark} continuing [controversy over enlargement]{.mark},
guiding allies to the sensible conclusion that it is time for the
alliance to begin closing its open door.]{.underline}

### UQ: AT Trump

**Trump rhetoric doesn't actually hurt allies, policy action is all that
effects the US**

**Carpenter 19**(Ted galen, senior fellow in security studies at the
Cato Institute and a contributing editor at the National Interest, is

There are several problems with the argument that Brooks and his
ideological brethren are propounding. First, the concept of a liberal
international order is at best aspirational and at worst fictional. The
reality is that it has been little more than a convenient façade for
U.S. hegemony exercised through Washington's network of military
alliances and U.S.-dominated international political and economic
institutions. The United States and its allies have routinely violated
the supposed norms of a rules-based international order whenever such
action seemed convenient. Second, [[the notion]{.mark} that [Trump's
foreign policy has been a]{.mark} dramatic [departure from]{.mark} those
of his [predecessors]{.mark} since World War II [is a myth]{.mark}. That
is especially true regarding security issues. [Although the president's
rhetoric toward]{.mark} Washington's longtime [allies has]{.mark}
sometimes [been abrasive]{.mark} and less collegial, [his actions have
differed little]{.mark}]{.underline} from the post--World War II norm.
[There certainly is no credible evidence that he is orchestrating a
withdrawal from Washington's multitude of global security commitments
and initiatives]{.underline}. Indeed, allegations of a retreat into
isolationism are especially bizarre as America seems poised on the brink
of war with Iran[. And [those making the "abandonment]{.mark} of global
leadership," "retreat from responsibility" and "embrace of isolationism"
[arguments have]{.mark} considerable [difficulty citing]{.mark} concrete
Trump administration [actions that correspond]{.mark} to those
cliches]{.underline}. Where, exactly, have such examples taken place?
[[Despite]{.mark} Trump's [rhetoric]{.mark} in the 2016 election
campaign [that]{.mark} the [U.S. intervention]{.mark} in Afghanistan
[should be terminated, he]{.mark} promptly [reneged on
that]{.mark}]{.underline} position, and Washington's war in that country
goes on with no apparent end in sight. Likewise, the United States
maintains a military presence in Syria and still pursues the
increasingly quixotic effort to unseat Bashar al-Assad's government.
Indeed, U.S. military action escalated, with air and missile strikes on
Syrian government forces. [[Nor has Trump terminated]{.mark} the
[Obama]{.mark} administration's [policy]{.mark} of making the United
States an accomplice in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, [despite]{.mark} the
proliferation of [war crimes]{.mark} by Washington's
allies.]{.underline} Indeed, overall ties with Riyadh have expanded
under Trump, and the president vetoed a congressional measure
terminating U.S. involvement in the coalition's Yemen war effort. Even
more worrisome, the Trump administration has ratcheted-up its
confrontational policy toward Iran. One will look in vain for any signs
of a U.S. "retreat" in the Middle East. Furthermore, [[allegations of
withdrawal have no]{.mark} greater [validity regarding]{.mark} U.S.
[security behavior in East Asia]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} U.S. [Navy]{.mark}
has [increased its "freedom of navigation" patrols throughout]{.mark}
[the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [during]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} years]{.underline}, despite Beijing's vehement
complaints. [Washington's [support for Taiwan has]{.mark} [grown]{.mark}
rather than diminished. [Trump]{.mark} eagerly [signed the new Taiwan
Travel Act]{.mark}]{.underline}, which for the first time authorized
meetings between high-level U.S. and Taiwanese officials. In May, [the
administration implemented that provision with a meeting between
National Security Adviser John Bolton and his Taiwanese
counterpart]{.underline}. Trump also has gone out of his way to stress
that Washington's ties with Japan, America's principal ally in East
Asia, remain as strong as ever. And although there have been some
differences with South Korea about policy toward North Korea, [there are
no signs that the United States is about to downgrade, much less
terminate, its military alliance with Seoul. So, again, [where is
the]{.mark} substantive [evidence of U.S. retreat]{.mark} or
abandonment]{.underline}? [[Such evidence also is lacking]{.mark} with
[respect to]{.mark} Washington's [relations with]{.mark} the
[N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [T]{.mark}reaty [O]{.mark}rganization
countries]{.underline}. During the 2016 campaign, Trump did call NATO
"obsolete," and he raised doubts about whether he embraced the North
Atlantic Treaty's Article 5 commitment that an attack on one member
would be treated as an attack on all. But once in office, he and his
associates quickly reversed course. [[Trump's annoyance]{.mark} with the
allies now [is]{.mark} largely [confined to]{.mark} traditional
burden-sharing [complaints]{.mark}. Meanwhile, other [U.S. actions
indicate]{.mark} that Washington's [security policy in Europe is as
active as ever]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contrary to the myth Trump's
domestic critics foster that he is willing to "do Putin's bidding,"
[administration actions point unmistakably to the opposite conclusion.
[Washington has supported expanding]{.mark} rather than contracting
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [backing Montenegro]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and Macedonia [as new members]{.mark}.]{.underline} U.S. forces have
joined in an accelerating number of NATO military exercises in Eastern
Europe and the Black Sea. Additionally, the Trump administration is now
in negotiations to build a permanent base in Poland. Moreover, contrary
to assertions that Trump seeks to appease Russia, the United States has
been training Ukrainian troops and has concluded not one, but two, arms
sales to Kyiv. That is curious behavior for an administration determined
to conduct a policy of retreat from Europe. The theory that Washington
is relinquishing its global leadership role on non-military matters is
not quite as absurd, but only marginally so. The Trump administration's
repudiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership did herald a narrower,
nationalistic orientation on trade issues. So, too, have Trump's
bilateral trade feuds with Canada, Mexico, and China. Nevertheless,
there is scant evidence that U.S. officials want America to be less
involved in global commerce. Instead, they seem to be angling for trade
on better terms for U.S. producers. The wisdom of that strategy is
certainly questionable, but the approach is still a far cry from
succumbing to isolationism. [When pressed, Trump's critics scramble to
point out actions such as his decision to end U.S. adherence to the
Paris climate accord---an agreement that the Obama administration never
even submitted to the Senate for ratification]{.underline}. Such
examples smack of desperation. An unwillingness to endorse a largely
symbolic, unenforceable measure reflecting hysteria on climate change is
hardly credible evidence of a U.S. retreat from global leadership.
[[It]{.mark} actually [would be gratifying]{.mark} [if]{.mark} Trump's
[critics were right]{.mark}. [Terminating]{.mark} crusading follies such
as the [interventions]{.mark} in Afghanistan and Syria [would be]{.mark}
a [good]{.mark} development, not a bad one]{.underline}. [[So, too,
would be a willingness to reassess NATO]{.mark}, an alliance created
seven decades ago under vastly]{.underline} different global conditions
to wage the Cold War against the Soviet Union. [[Likewise, it would be
worthwhile to conduct]{.mark} a sober [risk-benefit analysis
regarding]{.mark} the U.S. [defense commitments]{.mark} to Taiwan and
South Korea]{.underline}, given that the risk level in both cases is
rising rapidly. Unfortunately, despite the hostile propaganda that
Trump's opponents continue to circulate, there are no signs that he is
even considering, much less executing, a badly needed retrenchment in
America's global obligations.

**Trump is warming up relations now**

[[The]{.mark} U.S.-[Saudi Arabia alliance is built on decades of]{.mark}
security [cooperation and strong business ties]{.mark} dominated by U.S.
interests in Saudi oil. [The relationship has survived severe
challenges]{.mark}, including the 1973 oil embargo and 9/11 attacks, in
which fifteen of the nineteen passenger jet hijackers were Saudi
citizens]{.underline}. Successive U.S. administrations have held that
Saudi Arabia is a critical strategic partner in the region. [[Relations
between the two countries have grown]{.mark} especially [warm
under]{.mark} U.S. President Donald J. [Trump]{.mark} and Saudi de facto
leader Mohammed bin Salman]{.underline}, who was elevated to crown
prince in mid-2017. [[Both have ramped up efforts to counter
Iran]{.mark}, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival.]{.underline} However,
recent actions under the crown prince's leadership, particularly the
killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, are posing new strains on the
alliance, as many members of the U.S. Congress have called for punishing
Riyadh and reassessing the relationship. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
founded in 1932, traces its roots to an alliance between the Saud family
and descendants of religious cleric Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Abdul Wahab, who
espoused conservative Sunni jurisprudence. [[This pact has endured for
centuries, influencing the country's domestic and foreign
policy]{.mark}. Saudi authorities enforce religious
restrictions]{.underline}, denying women rights they enjoy in Western
democracies, and the government promotes its interpretation of sharia,
or Islamic law, by funding religious schools around the world. Though it
has recently lifted some restrictions, including a ban on women drivers,
human rights groups say rights abuses persist. [[The]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, first [through its oil industry
and]{.mark} then through [government contacts, established a
relationship with Saudi Arabia's]{.mark} founder, King Abdulaziz Ibn
Saud, and his successors [that evolved]{.mark} [into]{.mark} a [close
alliance]{.mark} despite a stark clash in values.]{.underline} [U.S.
[businesses have been involved]{.mark} in Saudi Arabia's oil industry
[since 1933]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} when the Standard Oil Company
of California (now Chevron) won a sixty-year concession to explore
eastern Saudi Arabia. It made its first oil discovery there in 1938.
U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the oil discovery's
strategic nature. His meeting with King Abdulaziz aboard the USS Quincy
in Egypt in 1945 solidified the relationship. Saudi Arabia was
officially neutral during World War II but allowed the Allies to use its
airspace.

one of the biggest decisions made in his two years in the White House:
[[His plan to totally withdraw U.S. forces from

Senior administration officials said Friday that [[Trump has agreed to

months after he announced that the terrorist organization ISIS had been

[[The]{.mark} shift follows **[pushback from

Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
think tank.

The decision upset Republicans and some Democrats on Capitol Hill who
said they were left out of the loop and worried that withdrawing troops
would only benefit U.S. adversaries Iran and Russia, the main backers of
Syrian leader Bashar Assad.

Defense officials, meanwhile, also have said they were not consulted on
the decision, which they said they would not have made amid concerns
that ISIS may gain new ground in the absence of U.S. forces. Trump\'s
push to withdraw troops also led to the resignation of former Defense
Secretary James Mattis two days after it was announced.

\"It would not have been my military advice at that particular time \...
I would not have made that suggestion, frankly,\" U.S. Central Command
head Gen. Joseph Votel said earlier this month.

Alterman said Trump's change of plans was the result of a two-month
process that should have taken place before the president's initial
declaration --- a process that includes input from defense officials,
lawmakers and consultation with allies.

"The total troop pullout was a bottom-up effort in government," he said.
"The president didn't get a series of option memos and consider a range
of possibilities in deciding on the pullout. The president didn't seem
to want that process. That process seems to have occurred \[but\] it
should have happened before the presidential announcement, not after."

Alterman added that while the administration looked for people to
support their view, "from Sen. \[Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)\] on down,
people they know are sympathetic, couldn't abide that approach."

Trump, meanwhile, has denied that leaving 400 troops behind is a
reversal from his initial plan, telling reporters on Friday that "I am
not reversing course" and again claiming ISIS is "100 percent defeated."

"I have done something that nobody else has been able to do. In another
short period of time, like hours, you\'ll be hearing --- hours and days
--- you\'ll be hearing about the caliphate. It\'s 100 percent defeated,"
Trump said.

The Pentagon has not officially declared ISIS defeated, and defense
officials have estimated roughly 1,000 fighters still remain, even as
its physical presence has all but been diminished. Numerous military and
intelligence officials believe the extremist group is still a threat.

Since December, lawmakers have made a concerted effort to press Trump to
change course, with Graham --- a frequent defender of Trump
administration policy --- calling a withdrawal by the end of April "the
dumbest f\-\--ing idea I've ever heard."

Congress also made clear a concern for Kurdish forces in Syria. Those
forces make up the bulk of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the group
used to help Washington in its defeat of ISIS in Syria. Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has threatened to launch a new assault
against the group, which Ankara considers terrorists connected to
Kurdish insurgents in Turkey.

The administration last month put conditions on a full withdrawal of
troops, including assurances from Turkey that it will not target
U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in Syria, but Turkey has been reluctant to
give any such protection promises.

All the warnings and pushback seemed to have their effect this week.

A senior administration official told reporters on Friday that the 400
troops to be left in Syria would be split between a group of about 200
to set up and maintain a safe zone currently being negotiated for
northeast Syria, and 200 at the U.S. military base at al-Tanf.

[[The 200 troops based at al-Tanf]{.mark}, near the Syrian border with

doubts: "We should not pull down the blinds . . . and sit in the parlor

action. It did not work and it had not been cheap." The siren song of
withdrawal that prevailed so disastrously in the 1930s and had to be
beaten back in the early 1950s and again in the mid-1970s is being heard
once more today. At the start of a new administration it remains to be
seen whether the next generation of U.S. political leaders will rise to
the challenge and rally the American people as their predecessors did.

After Jan. 20, President Donald [[Trump will juggle]{.mark} a number of
[**important tensions** with]{.mark} longstanding **[U.S.
allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[For example]{.underline}]{.mark},
Trump's tweets suggest rapprochement with Russia is a priority, yet NATO
allies and the U.S. Congress will press for support to
[**[NATO]{.mark}** allies, such as those in the **Baltic**
region]{.underline}. [In Asia]{.underline}, Trump has promised to take a
strong line against Chinese assertiveness, but has also questioned
whether [[**Japan** and **South Korea**]{.underline}]{.mark} are
contributing enough to contain China.

So Trump faces this dilemma: [[how can he reassure allies]{.mark} while
engaging adversaries? Our [**research** suggests]{.mark}]{.underline}
one possibility: **[[arms transfers]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In our recent International Security article, we elaborate on the
"patron's dilemma" that arises when relationships with allies change. We
explain [[the **decades-old U.S. playbook**]{.mark}, which [calls for
the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to **signal
reassurance**]{.mark} and deterrence [via **arms
transfers**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while improving ties with adversaries.

Will Trump follow this playbook? [[Arms transfers are **particularly
useful** when **geostrategic priorities** are
**shifting**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here's why [[we think Trump will use
this]{.mark} foreign policy [tool]{.mark}]{.underline}:

1\. [[Arms transfers]{.underline}]{.mark} accomplish two important
goals: upgrading local deterrent capabilities and
**[[offset]{.underline}]{.mark}**ting **[[fears of
abandonment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Allies are better equipped to defend
themselves, thanks to U.S. weapons.

2\. Arms transfers typically don't attract as much attention as U.S.
military deployments or new treaty commitments. But they can enable the
recipient to engage in aggressive foreign policies that the United
States might not desire, especially if the arms transfers enable
offensive operations. Experts call this worry "entrapment" --- when an
ally gets drawn into another country's conflict.

3\. [**Arms [transfers signal]{.mark}** a different form of
**[commitment]{.mark}** than alliances]{.underline}. After all, treaty
alliances tie hands by requiring allies to fight for one another in any
future conflict. Such treaties are formalized security ties --- and
usually follow a politicized ratification process. These "pieces of
paper" are inflexible, but do not necessarily require follow-up military
investment.

What sorts of arms transfers are most likely?

Two factors shape what combination of alliances and arms the United
States might offer its clients.

First, U.S. foreign policymakers look at shared security interests when
deciding whether to form or maintain an alliance. To make this
determination, U.S. policymakers typically ask whether the client state
has a similar or different ranking of security threats than that of the
United States.

Here's an example. Both Western Europe and the United States shared the
view that the Soviet Union was the leading threat to their vital
interests after World War II, so they formed NATO.

If the threat rankings align, Washington seeks to establish or
strengthen an alliance. If the threat rankings differ, then U.S. foreign
policymakers find that avoiding or downgrading an alliance commitment
better serves U.S. interests. Indeed, that is why the Carter
administration scrapped the U.S. formal alliance with Taiwan to
normalize ties with China in 1978.

Second, U.S. leaders decide whether to arm the client. In making this
decision, policymakers ask whether the client can deter its adversary
without U.S. assistance. If the local security balance favors an
adversary, then transfers of U.S. weapons may be necessary to bolster
the client's security. If the local security balance favors the ally,
substantial arms transfers are unnecessary --- and can even encourage
entrapment by the client.

Here's what this will mean in practice --- more arms transfers

So how might the next administration approach the geopolitical
conundrums associated with adjusting U.S. alliances? If U.S. leaders
seek rapprochement with Russia, is there a quid pro quo?

A close aide of Vladimir Putin has already suggested that pulling back
NATO forces from the Baltic region would reassure Moscow that Washington
seeks closer ties. Yet if Trump obliges, then he might be under pressure
from Congress and from NATO allies to reassure Baltic countries that the
United States will minimize the risks of Russia exploiting any great
power bargain.

[[To **solidify**]{.mark} the **U.S. [long-term commitment]{.mark}**[,
**Washington** might **offer** lethal defensive
**weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline} to boost Baltic ground and air
defenses. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} move [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
then [[enhance]{.mark} local deterrence]{.underline}.

Russia might have no other choice than to accept this compromise if its
desire for rapprochement is sincere. [[For a **precedent**]{.underline},
[look no further than the]{.underline}]{.mark} recent [[Iran deal. Since
the]{.underline}]{.mark} July 2015 [Iran nuclear [deal]{.mark}, [Saudi
Arabia]{.mark} has [received large amounts of]{.mark} U.S.
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, including an arms agreement worth \$1
billion, [[to **attenuate**]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[[security
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[This]{.mark} scenario [played ou]{.mark}t often [after]{.mark} the
[normalization]{.mark} of relations [with China]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Washington agreed to recognize Beijing as the official government of
China. Yet [[Washington]{.mark} often [made]{.mark} [major]{.mark} arms
[transfers]{.mark} like fighter jets and surface-to-air missile systems
[to **Taiwan** to reassure Taipei]{.mark} that the United States
remained committed to Taiwan's ability to defend itself
against]{.underline} mainland [China]{.underline}.

Following Obama's footsteps?

Unlike his stance on Russia, Trump appears to favor a more hawkish
approach toward China, as evidence by his comments on the one-China
policy. Yet Trump's comments about burden-sharing by Japan and South
Korea create a tension because balancing against China would require
strengthening --- not weakening --- alliances with Japan and South
Korea.

History suggests that more arms sales to Taiwan are possible because the
cross-strait military balance is worsening due to China's military
modernization. The Trump administration might feel it necessary to make
larger, more advanced, and more sustained arms packages than those
committed to by President Obama in 2015.

Moreover, despite calls for greater alliance burden-sharing by Japan and
South Korea, the new Trump administration might invest more in those
alliances to maintain local military balances against China and North
Korea, respectively.

In short, the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[might end up
**relying on arms transfers** as its **chief tool** of
**reassurance**]{.mark} and **deterrence** [from **Europe to
Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In doing so, Trump would follow in the
footsteps of the Obama administration, which authorized more arms sales
than any U.S. administration since World War II. For alliance politics,
arms transfers might be the new art of the deal.

These questions are important in international politics because [[great
powers face a "**patron\'s dilemma**]{.underline}]{.mark}." [Great
powers must adopt policies to [provide security to]{.mark} their [allies
**without becoming entrapped** in]{.mark} an **[unwanted
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Strong commitments]{.underline}**,
[such as **treaty alliances**, **worsen**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**risk of [entrapment]{.mark}**]{.underline}---that is, the patron\'s
fear of [being dragged into an undesirable war]{.underline}. [**[Weak
commitments]{.underline}**, [such as **verbal assurances**,
**intensify**]{.underline}]{.mark} [a client\'s **[fears of
abandonment]{.mark}**]{.underline}---in other words, [the client\'s fear
of receiving inadequate support should a crisis develop]{.underline}.
Such is the traditional alliance dilemma that has been analyzed by Glenn
Snyder and other scholars.1

Grasping the patron\'s dilemma is central to understanding not only U.S.
security commitments but also many related patterns of interstate
behavior. [[For example]{.underline}]{.mark}, efforts to secure an
Iranian nuclear deal have produced calls for stronger defense ties
between the United States and [**[Israel]{.underline}**, **[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[A]{.mark}**rab **[E]{.mark}**mirates]{.underline}, among others. Such
ties could include formal treaty alliances or the sale of additional
arms. Some [[analysts warn]{.mark} that [**insufficient assurances**
could trigger **nuclear proli**]{.mark}feration [or]{.mark}]{.underline}
even **[[regional war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Elsewhere]{.underline} in
the world, [[China\'s]{.mark} recent [assertiveness]{.mark} has
[made]{.mark} U.S. allies]{.underline}, [such as **[Japan]{.mark}** and
the **[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and partners, such as
[**[Vietnam]{.underline}** [and **Taiwan**]{.underline},
[anxious]{.underline}]{.mark}. This alliance anxiety has forced the
United States to reconsider its provision of arms and alliances.
[[Similar issues are at play with **Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Actual and potential [Russian aggression]{.underline} toward Eastern
Europe [has fueled debate about whether existing U.S. security
guarantees are sufficient and whether Ukraine should receive lethal U.S.
arms]{.underline}. In all these regions, we expect the patron\'s dilemma
to remain intense. This article elucidates the choices and constraints
facing decisionmakers managing this dilemma.

The decisions of great powers to transfer arms or form alliances often
present intriguing empirical puzzles. In 2015, the United States
supported thirty-two treaty allies and allocated billions in security
assistance worldwide. Surprisingly, U.S. treaty allies received only 2
percent of all U.S. foreign military financing, whereas five non-allied
countries received more than 90 percent. Among this group of five
non-allied U.S. partners, Israel received \$3.1 billion (55 percent of
U.S. foreign military financing), Egypt \$1.3 billion (23 percent),
Jordan \$300 million (5 percent), Pakistan \$280 million (5 percent),
and Iraq \$250 million (5 percent).2 This variation is even more
intriguing when considered historically. During the Cold War, the United
States provided weapons and alliances to many states, including Pakistan
and Taiwan, but transferred arms to Israel without a formal defense
pact. Yet Pakistan and Taiwan eventually lost their alliances despite
seeing U.S. arms transfers continue, if not increase. Why did the United
States modulate its arms and alliances provision during the Cold War?
And why would it today decline to offer some states defense pacts but
give them more military financing than it does to its treaty allies?

A patron\'s choice to provide arms, alliances, or both, raises academic
questions because extending alliances and transferring arms produce many
similar benefits. Both policies are useful for deterring adversaries and
reassuring clients while exerting some influence over them. Alliances
strengthen deterrence and defense by aggregating capabilities and
enhancing combined operations and planning. Arms transfers deter and
defend by altering the local military balance. Like alliances, arms
transfers can signal a patron\'s commitment to maintain its client\'s
security. Still, the conditions under which great power patrons transfer
arms and extend defense pacts have not been thoroughly examined. In the
relatively small literature on this topic, prominent scholars have
argued that U.S. military assistance---arms or alliances---to clients is
driven by nonstrategic calculations, such as domestic political factors
or commercial motivations.3

In this article, we offer a unified strategic logic that explains how
patrons calibrate the provision of arms and alliances. We argue that
patrons make such decisions primarily on the basis of two factors:
first, the extent to which the patron believes that it and its client
have common security interests; and second, whether the patron believes
that its client has military capabilities sufficient to deter its main
adversary and prevail should deterrence fail. These two variables
interact to shape the bundle of security commitments---arms and
alliances---that the patron offers to its client. [[Our analysis
reveals]{.mark} when [patrons use]{.mark} these [**security goods** as
**substitutes and complements**]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 [We shed light on
how [patrons **manage** the **alliance dilemma** by using **arms
transfers**]{.mark} to affect the behavior of their
clients]{.underline}. [We show that **[arms]{.mark}** and alliances can
[help]{.mark} to [**reassure clients** and **mitigate**]{.mark} their
[**fears of abandonment** by **complementing**]{.mark} **existing
[alliances]{.mark}** [while **minimizing**]{.mark} **[entrapment
risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Simply put, [the patron\'s dilemma
revolves around how best to use arms transfers to address the alliance
dilemma]{.underline}.

[[Our allies' requests have similarities]{.mark} as well. Generally
speaking, [our partners want a]{.mark} large and [well-equipped]{.mark}
U.S. military [presence]{.mark} in their neighborhood, [ISR support,
access to technology, high-end military platforms, and]{.mark} as many
U.S. Cabinet members as possible coming through their capitals,
especially if those visits come with [concrete
deliverables]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Asia, nervous allies welcome
Obama's rebalance strategy, but ask whether its implementation matches
its ambition. They worry that the U.S. buildup in the Pacific is too
slow to match Beijing's military modernization and its expanding
territorial claims in the South China Sea. They want a stronger U.S.
naval presence, a maritime coalition of the willing, clarity on the
conditions under which the U.S. would act militarily, and heavier
engagement in regional institutions like ASEAN. They also want the
administration to finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after
five long years of negotiations. Meanwhile, [[Europe]{.mark}an allies
[confronted]{.mark} with [a growing Russian threat]{.mark} regard the
Pacific with some jealousy]{.underline}. Still, [[U.S]{.mark}. military
f[orces]{.mark}, which had been steadily moving out of Europe for more
than two decades, have since the Ukraine crisis [begun flowing back
in]{.mark}.]{.underline} Starting [[last year]{.mark}, over 1,000 U.S.
troops have been rotating throughout Eastern Europe to train and
exercise with NATO counterparts. [Coming soon are new stocks of]{.mark}
prepositioned [U.S. equipment, including heavy
armor]{.mark}]{.underline}. These efforts are being funded by an
additional \$1 billion the Obama administration received last year as
part of the "European Reassurance Initiative." Yet the Europeans know
that most of these reassurance measures are temporary. [[With]{.mark}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} expected [to stay in]{.mark}
[office]{.mark} [at least through 2024, they are anxious to
secure]{.mark} a [permanent]{.mark} U.S.
[commitment]{.mark}]{.underline} (read: boots on the ground) with a
heavier emphasis on deterrence. [[In the Middle East, the Gulf states
and Israel worry]{.mark} that [the U.S. is rushing to accommodate
Ira]{.mark}n, and that the recent nuclear deal will lead to even more
aggressive Iranian behavior]{.underline}. So the U.S. has shifted into
reassurance overdrive: pouring resources into the region, sending
cabinet-level officials on visits (Ash Carter was there two weeks ago,
and John Kerry is there this week), working to maintain a robust
military presence, trying to improve security cooperation with the Gulf
states, and providing an unprecedented level of military capabilities
(several recent arms sales have been the largest in U.S. history). [When
one steps back [to consider the demands of global]{.mark} reassurance,
three conclusions stand out. First, easing fully the anxieties of our
allies [would require a level of resources]{.mark} that would be very
[difficult to muster]{.mark} [and]{.mark} even [hard]{.mark}er [to
maintain.]{.mark} Region by region, it is easy to see how [the
U.S.]{.mark} [could add more military capabilities, sell more weapons,
or get more diplomatically engaged.]{.mark}]{.underline} But the
challenge for President Obama and his successor will be to do all this
simultaneously, especially when the resources for reassurance are
tighter. Just as the world is asking for more, the dynamic in Washington
will leave us with less. Some [[reforms may be necessary]{.mark} --
[closing]{.mark} some outdated [facilities]{.mark} overseas, or
[reducing the size of the U.S. Army]{.mark} -- but [that will make
reassurance harder]{.mark}]{.underline}. The next President will have to
be more creative as he or she seeks to balance competing demands in a
way that is effective, realistic and sustainable. A good start would be
acomprehensive review of U.S. force posture that would weigh allies'
requests for reassurance against America's core national security
interests and its resource constraints.

**As military budgeting becomes increasingly tight, arms sales remain
increasingly important for global military cooperation**

**Linczer 16** (Edward, Edward Linczer is a Research Associate at the
American Enterprise Institute and a Non-Resident Junior Fellow at the
Center for the National Interest. "Gray Hulls and Air Patrols: The Role
of Security Assistance in Washington's Pivot to Southeast Asia," Center
for the National Interest, October 2016)

Third, burden sharing. The US military, while by far the world's most
dominant, faces an ends-means crunch owing to the Budget Control Act of
2011. Admiral Harry B. Harris, commander of US Pacific Command,
testified before the US Congress in February 2016, stating "I don't have
the submarines that I feel I need." Three years ago US Rear Admiral
Thomas Moore declared that the United States has an "11-carrier Navy in
a 15-carrier world."60 These are just a few of the comments that
high-ranking officials have made regarding US military capacity. [[With
defense budget uncertainty ahead, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[looks to]{.mark} its [partners to]{.mark} shoulder a greater
[share]{.mark} of [the burden in addressing regional security]{.mark}
challenges]{.underline}, from humanitarian assistance/disaster relief
(HADR) and anti-piracy missions at the low end of the capability
spectrum, to substantive warfighting contributions in the event of a
regional conflict.61 Fourth, interoperability. [Military
[interoperability is necessary]{.mark} for the US [to achieve]{.mark}
its [security objectives]{.mark} with partners [in the region]{.mark}.
Whether transferring relief to monsoon victims, sharing intelligence, or
operating integrated ballistic missile defense systems, US military
forces and their peers must cooperate at a tactical level
daily]{.underline}. While interoperability is honed at regular joint
military exercises where the US and partners develop shared military
techniques, tactics, and 16 standard operating procedures,
interoperability also requires common platforms and systems.62 One [of
[the primary advantages of the F-35
program]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in which 12 US partners
participate[, [is]{.mark} sharing [a global coalition of interoperable
air fleets]{.mark}]{.underline} unlike the piecemeal commonalities of
current fighter fleets. 63 For the US, FMS packages do not simply
involve off-the-shelf hardware transfer, but also offer long-term
training opportunities on new weapons systems to create interoperability
between armed forces[. [For example, Singapore]{.underline}]{.mark} [has
[purchased several]{.mark} tranches of [F-16s]{.mark} from Washington
over the years. [These]{.mark}]{.underline} [arms [sales include a
three-year training]{.mark} [program]{.mark} for Royal Singaporean Air
Force pilots]{.underline} in Tucson, Arizona.64 This US-Singaporean
joint air force training program speaks to the importance of
Washington's FMS programs in building durable security relationships.
Fifth, access and influence. Security assistance arguably represents
America's best way to build long-term defense ties with regional
partners. These programs also serve as a powerful signal of US strategic
interests [-- [arms sales reassure allies and partners of Washington's
commitment to]{.mark} [upholding]{.mark} its [security
guarantees]{.mark}. By purchasing US arms[, a recipient country
is]{.mark} not simply buying off-the-shelf hardware, but is instead
[investing in a long-term relationship that will aid]{.mark} its
military [in training, acquisition reform, strategic planning, and
logistical support]{.mark}. Large military sales programs build
extensive bilateral defense ties because they involve large segments of
the US interagency process. Arms sales and training are the glue that
binds together the US alliance network.]{.underline}

**Continued arms dealing is necessary to modernize Eastern European
allies against a growing Russian threat, stopping arms sales destroys
any chance of capable militaries**

where he focuses on European security and U.S.-Russia policy. From 2011
to 2017, he served in the U.S. Department of State in a number of
different positions, "TO HELP NATO ALLIES GET OFF RUSSIAN EQUIPMENT, THE
UNITED STATES SHOULD REVIVE DEFENSE LENDING," War on the Rocks,
02/14/2018)

Last June, a Romanian fighter jet crashed in a wheat field along the
country's Black Sea coast. The fighter was participating in a Romanian
and Bulgarian military exercise when it experienced a major engine
malfunction, forcing the pilot to eject. [[The crash of a NATO]{.mark}
country's [jet may sound like a freak accident]{.mark}, but in this
case, it is anything but. [The plane that went down was]{.mark} not a
modern fighter jet, but [a Soviet]{.mark}-era [MiG-21 from a fleet
of]{.mark} aging [Soviet fighters]{.mark} that has experienced a litany
of accidents. At any given moment less than half of this fleet is
operational. [This]{.mark} incident [highlights a broad]{.mark}er
[issue]{.mark}: The militaries of [NATO's former communist members
remain reliant on Soviet]{.mark}-era [equipment]{.mark}, leaving them
[in pressing need of overhaul]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is not the
first time the United States has faced the dilemma of how to build a
strong military alliance with woefully deficient allies. As the Soviet
Union turned from ally to adversary [after World War II, the militaries
of its newly liberated western European allies were in a shambolic
state. U.S. efforts to foster the economic revival of Western European
countries through the Marshall Plan were soon followed by a similar
effort to revive their military capabilities. Through [the 1949
M]{.mark}utual [D]{.mark}efense [A]{.mark}ssistance [A]{.mark}ct [and
the 1951 M]{.mark}utual [S]{.mark}ecurity [A]{.mark}ct the US [provided
more than \$50 billion]{.mark} (in today's dollars[) in military aid
to]{.mark} the newly formed North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.mark}). U.S. [assistance helped]{.mark} get [the militaries of
Western Europe back on their feet,]{.mark} laying the [groundwork
for]{.mark} [the most successful]{.mark} military [alliance in
history]{.mark}. Yet [following the end of the C]{.mark}old
[W]{.mark}ar[, there was no]{.mark} similar American [effort to
modernize]{.mark} the militaries of its new Eastern European
allies]{.underline}. When NATO expanded in the late 1990s, it
incorporated former Eastern Bloc members whose militaries possessed vast
aging kits of Soviet and Russian military equipment. As America
encouraged Russian integration into Europe, bolstering the military
capabilities of NATO's 10 new eastern members with modern, Western
technology didn't seem to be a pressing need. Today, however, the United
States faces the revival of "great power competition" from Russia and
China, as the Trump administration outlined in its National Security
Strategy. [[Just as the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and NATO helped
rebuild the militaries of West Europe]{.mark}an nations to counter the
Soviet threat[, a similar effort to build up]{.mark} the [capabilities
of Eastern Europe]{.mark}an NATO countries [is needed now. While the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} doggedly [pressed]{.mark}
its [allies to spend more on defense, it should also help]{.mark} these
countries do so [by supporting their investment in]{.mark} new [military
capabilities]{.mark} and encouraging them to spend more effectively.
Reviving [American defense lending through an Eastern European Security
Investment Initiative would be]{.mark} a [strategically valuable and
fiscally manageable]{.mark} way to invest in the military capabilities
of NATO's eastern allies]{.underline}. Vulnerable on the Eastern Front
With the alliance facing a renewed challenge from Russia, the aging
hardware of NATO's eastern members creates numerous vulnerabilities.
NATO's former Eastern Bloc members depend on increasingly decrepit and
unreliable Soviet-era equipment that breaks down frequently. Echoing
Romania's troubles, [[Bulgarian pilots]{.mark} in October [refused to
even fly their MiG-29s]{.mark} for fear the planes were dangerous to
operate. The effectiveness of these countries' weaponry is also
questionable compared to modern Russian systems. For instance,
[Ukraine's Soviet-era anti-tank weaponry]{.mark} often [proved
ineffective against modern Russian tanks]{.mark} with reactive
armor]{.underline}. Romania and Bulgaria's air defense systems are
largely of Soviet origin and increasingly obsolete against modern
threats. By continuing to operate Soviet-bloc equipment[, [Eastern NATO
members]{.mark} also [have to maintain a]{.mark} [relationship with
Russia's defense industry]{.mark} --- now under Western sanctions ---
[to perform maintenance and procure spare parts]{.mark} and components.
The Czech military's Chief of the General Staff, Josef Becvar, explained
recently that 41 of his country's 51 helicopters were Russian-made,
noting, "[It causes enormous problems, spare parts are lacking]{.mark}.
We are in fact [captives of the Russian suppliers]{.mark}."
[This]{.mark} reliance [not only injects cash into Russia's defense
industry, but also gives Russia leverage and influence over Eastern
European militaries]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Thus, like Western
European countries prior to the Marshall Plan, the states of Eastern
Europe today form a poor first line of defense against a resurgent
Russia. Recognizing this, the United States has invested billions of
dollars through the European Deterrence Initiative, formerly the
European Reassurance Initiative, to bolster its military presence in
Europe. NATO has also bolstered air policing missions over the Baltic
Sea and north Atlantic and bolstered its forward deployed presence
through multinational battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and
Poland. But [while [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and NATO]{.mark}
have spent billions to bolster the alliance's military presence, they
[have not devoted]{.mark} significant [resources to]{.mark} help
[bolster]{.mark} the individual military capabilities of [eastern
allies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Abandoning allies spills over 

**Stratfor 18** (Stratfor, 4-5-2018, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of
a U.S. Pullout From Syria,\" No Publication,
<https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/04/05/the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_of_a_us_pullout_from_syria_113286.html>)

[Leaving Syria would also carry significant costs and possibly hurt U.S.
goals and interests, including its primary mission there: the fight
against the Islamic State and other violent extremist groups. The
Islamic State has largely been shattered as a conventional force in the
region, but it is still far from completely defeated]{.underline}. It
remains determined to pursue its struggle as an insurgency, waiting for
an opportunity to rebuild itself much as an earlier version of the group
did in 2011-12 in Iraq. Over the past two months, the Islamic State has
taken advantage of distractions to step up its operations and attacks in
eastern Syria. The SDF is focused on resisting Turkey\'s Operation Olive
Branch, and the Syrian government\'s forces are intent on defeating the
rebels in eastern Ghouta, creating breathing space for the Islamic
State. And the struggling militant organization isn\'t alone. Tanzim
Hurras al-Deen (an al Qaeda affiliate), Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the
Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria are also staying active. So a complete
U.S. withdrawal would greatly weaken Washington\'s ability to keep these
groups in check. A pullout would also hurt another major U.S. objective:
limiting [Iran\'s
expansion](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/turkey-and-iran-push-and-pull-over-syria)
in the region[. [The U]{.mark}nited [States is using its presence
in]{.mark} eastern [Syria to put pressure on Tehran]{.mark}\'s supply
lines to its allies in Damascus and Lebanon. The SDF occupies major
energy-producing and agricultural areas in Syria that Tehran and
Damascus are keen to retake; the SDF presence also provides a
springboard that the United States could use to threaten key Iranian
positions in the country in case of further conflict. What little
ability the United States has to shape events in Syria, particularly in
future peace talks, is tied to its presence there alongside the SDF. [A
sudden withdrawal]{.mark} that leaves Syrian Democratic Forces
vulnerable to attacks directed by Damascus and Ankara [will damage U.S.
credibility as an ally. The United States has repeatedly and publicly
proclaimed that it will not abandon those forces]{.mark}. It has
invested considerable time, resources and effort in building up the SDF
as an organization --- along with direct U.S. ties to it. [If
countries]{.mark} and organizations [across the Mid]{.mark}dle [East,
and beyond, believe that Washington could abandon them at any time, they
will be hesitant to partner with the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,
especially if there is an alternative ally. In the Middle East, this
alternative could be Russia, which could use the pullout to enhance its
position in the region]{.underline}. Finally, a number of [regional
allies are invested in the continued U.S. presence in Syria. [Whether
these allies are primarily interested in U.S. efforts]{.mark} to contain
Iran --- Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United Arab Emirates --- [or are
worried about the]{.mark} violent [extremist threat]{.mark} --- Jordan
--- [they would be greatly alarmed at a sudden
withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the White House said on April
4 that the United States would stay in Syria to fight the Islamic State
for now[, a final decision on a pullout is still up in the
air]{.underline}. The U.S. president has broad authority to order a
withdrawal if he concludes that is the right course. Trump has said that
the United States has spent enough time and money in the region, and the
White House has frozen more than \$200 million that was set aside to
help recovery efforts in Syria. But his remarks run counter to the
January 2018 update of U.S. policy there. Those guidelines advocated a
greater U.S. commitment and expanded goals, including the return of
refugees, a change of government in Damascus and the elimination of the
country\'s chemical weapons. Without a physical presence, achieving
those goals will be extremely unlikely.

#### Foreign Military Sales are key to advancing security -- withdrawal signals abandonment

**Goure 16** (Goure, Daniel, 2-29-2016, \"Foreign Military Sales Remain
An Important Tool Of U.S. National Security,\"

Dr. Goure is Senior Vice President with the Lexington Institute, a
nonprofit public-policy research organization headquartered in
Arlington, Virginia. He is involved in a wide range of issues as part of
the institute's national security program.)

As still the world's sole superpower[, [the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited
[S]{.mark}tates [possesses]{.mark} an unequaled array of [instruments to
support its foreign]{.mark} and [defense strategies]{.mark}. With so
much attention being focused on the conflicts in the Middle East,
Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and Chinese efforts to assert its
hegemony in the Western Pacific, the fact that the United States employs
a wide range of non-military, or at least non-kinetic tools in pursuing
its national interests is lost]{.underline}. Most recently, for example,
the United States and China agreed on the imposition of new trade
sanctions on North Korea in response to that country's test of a
long-range ballistic missile. [[One of the most important of these tools
is]{.mark} foreign military sales ([FMS]{.mark}). The complex role of
FMS is reflected, in part, in the fact that the program is run by the
Department of State and not the Department of Defense. One reason for
this unusual management approach is that the FMS program involves sales
by the U.S. government of U.S. arms, defense equipment, defense
services, and military training to foreign governments. As a result,
[such sales reflect the views of the U.S. government with respect to the
recipient country]{.mark}, its relationships with others in the region
[and the]{.mark} overall [approach this country takes to mitigating the
threat of]{.mark} regional or global [conflict]{.mark}. The FMS program
serves many other purposes. The sales of U.S. arms and related items to
foreign countries helps reduce the cost of those systems to our own
military[**.** FMS sales help to ensure **the ability of U.S. allies to
defend themselves** and support the maintenance **of stable regional
military balances**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Equally important, FMS sales
over time establish enduring relationships between foreign governments
and their militaries and the U.S. When the U.S. military trains
alongside those of allies equipped with the same hardware, it helps to
cement the bonds between our countries. [Moreover, it improves
communications and understanding among these militaries, often [helping
to inculcate U.S. values related to the use of military force]{.mark}.
Foreign militaries dependent on access to U.S. hardware, spare parts,
software upgrades and training are more likely to listen to this country
when there is a dispute regarding regional politics or defense issues.
FMS has been particularly important as an instrument for influencing
foreign governments and shaping regional balances of power in the Middle
East.]{.underline} Following the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the United
States completely reequipped the Egyptian military. The Egyptian-Israeli
border has been remarkably stable ever since. Sales of military
aircraft, missile defense systems and precision munitions to the nations
of the Persian Gulf have been instrumental in ensuring a stable balance
of forces in that area. Pakistan has been a recipient of U.S. arms[.
[FMS sales have been extremely important to U.S. efforts to
ensure]{.mark} Pakistan's [reliability as an ally]{.mark} in the war on
terror. Congress has appropriated about \$3.6 billion in Foreign
Military Financing (FMF) for Pakistan since 2001. The kind of equipment
provided ranges from radios, transport aircraft and unmanned systems to
F-16 fighters. Recently, the State Department approved the sale of eight
F-16s to Pakistan. Pakistan intends to use these aircraft in its fight
against domestic terrorists.]{.underline} The U.S. and other regional
allies have found the F-16 to be an effective platform for conducting
precision strikes against terrorist targets. In addition, India is
pursuing a major Air Force modernization program. The sale of F-16s to
Pakistan would help to maintain the balance of power in the
subcontinent. Unfortunately, Senator Rand Paul has filed a Joint
Resolution of Disapproval for this sale, something that hasn't happened
since the 1980s. [The [effort to block this sale]{.mark} is a mistake.
It will serve only to [weaken the relationship between our two
countries]{.mark} even as the fight against the Taliban continues and
intensifies in Afghanistan. In addition, it leaves the way open for
Pakistan to acquire aircraft from other suppliers, such as China or
Russia. The [only practical effect]{.mark} that disapproval of this sale
will have [is to weaken Washington's hand at a time when it needs all
the policy instruments it can muster]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Military sales key to assurance

**Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, and Cooper 17** (Keren Yarhi-Milo, 1-13-2017,
\"Analysis,\" Washington Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/13/can-donald-trump-rely-on-arms-transfers-to-reassure-u-s-allies/?utm_term=.c9364f5d44e5>)

After Jan. 20, President Donald Trump will juggle a number of important
tensions with longstanding U.S. allies. For example, Trump's tweets
suggest rapprochement with Russia is a priority, yet NATO allies and the
U.S. Congress will press for support to NATO allies, such as those in
the Baltic region. In Asia, Trump has promised to take a strong line
against Chinese assertiveness, but has also questioned whether Japan and
South Korea are contributing enough to contain China. So [[Trump faces
this dilemma: how can he reassure allies while engaging
adversaries]{.mark}? Our research suggests one possibility: [arms
transfers]{.mark}. In our [recent International Security
article](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00250#.WGvBzbYrJE4),
we elaborate on the "patron's dilemma" that arises when relationships
with allies change.]{.underline} We explain the [decades-old U.S.
playbook](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/thoughts-on-the-taiwan-relations-act/),
which calls for [the [U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited [S]{.mark}tates to
[signal reassurance and deterrence via arms transfers]{.mark}, while
improving ties with adversaries. Will Trump follow this playbook? Arms
[transfers are particularly useful when geostrategic priorities are
shifting]{.mark}. Here's why we think Trump will use this foreign policy
tool: [Arms transfers]{.mark} accomplish two important goals:
[upgrad]{.mark}ing [local deterrent capabilities and offset]{.mark}ting
fears of [abandonment]{.mark}. Allies are better equipped to defend
themselves, thanks to U.S. weapons.]{.underline} Arms transfers
[typically don't attract as much attention]{.underline} as U.S. military
deployments or new treaty commitments. But they can enable the recipient
to engage in aggressive foreign policies that the United States might
not desire, especially if the arms transfers enable offensive
operations. Experts call this worry
"[entrapment](http://www.futureforeignpolicy.com/entrapment-commitment-pivot-asia/)"
--- when an ally gets drawn into another country's conflict[. Arms
transfers signal a different form of commitment than alliances. After
all, treaty alliances tie hands by requiring allies to fight for one
another in any future conflict.]{.underline} Such treaties are
formalized security ties --- and usually follow a politicized
ratification process. These "pieces of paper" are inflexible, but do not
necessarily require follow-up military investment. What sorts of arms
transfers are most likely? Two factors shape what combination of
alliances and arms the United States might offer its clients. First,
U.S. foreign policymakers look at shared security interests when
deciding whether to form or maintain an alliance. To make this
determination, U.S. policymakers typically ask whether the client state
has a similar or different ranking of security threats than that of the
United States. Here's an example. Both Western Europe and the United
States shared the view that the Soviet Union was the leading threat to
their vital interests after World War II, so they formed NATO. If the
threat rankings align, Washington seeks to establish or strengthen an
alliance. If the threat rankings differ, then U.S. foreign policymakers
find that avoiding or downgrading an alliance commitment better serves
U.S. interests. Indeed, that is why the Carter administration scrapped
the U.S. formal alliance with Taiwan to normalize ties with China in
1978. \[[Trump is risking war by turning the One China question into a
bargaining
chip](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/12/trump-is-risking-war-by-turning-the-one-china-question-into-a-bargaining-chip/?utm_term=.a03796a76f72)\]
Second, U.S. leaders decide whether to arm the client. In making this
decision, policymakers ask whether the client can deter its adversary
without U.S. assistance. If the local security balance favors an
adversary, then transfers of U.S. weapons may be necessary to bolster
the client's security. If the local security balance favors the ally,
substantial arms transfers are unnecessary --- and can even encourage
entrapment by the client. Here's what this will mean in practice ---
more arms transfers So how might the next administration approach the
geopolitical conundrums associated with adjusting U.S. alliances? If
U.S. leaders [seek rapprochement with
Russia](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/world/europe/trump-russia-us-foe-to-friend.html),
is there a quid pro quo? A close aide of Vladimir Putin has already
suggested that [pulling back NATO
forces](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/295849a11d584a71bc512bba26c551ea/putin-aide-trump-could-build-confidence-nato-pullback)
from the Baltic region would reassure Moscow that Washington seeks
closer ties. Yet if Trump obliges, then he might be under [pressure from
Congress](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/world/europe/nato-baltic-states-russia.html)
and from NATO allies to reassure Baltic countries that the United States
will minimize the risks of Russia exploiting any great power bargain.
[[To solidify]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} long-term [commitment,
Washington might offer]{.mark} lethal defensive [weapons to
boost]{.mark} [Baltic ground and air
[defenses]{.mark}](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03071847.2016.1253367).
This move would then [enhance local deterrence]{.mark}.
Russia]{.underline} might have no other choice than to accept this
compromise if its desire for rapprochement is sincere. [For a precedent,
look no further than the recent Iran deal]{.underline}. Since the July
2015 Iran nuclear deal, Saudi Arabia has received large amounts of U.S.
weapons, [including an arms agreement worth \$1
billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/politics/iran-deal-will-top-agenda-when-saudi-king-visits-white-house.html?_r=0),
to attenuate its security concerns. This scenario played out often after
the [normalization of
relations](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/china-policy)
with China. [[Washington agreed to recognize Beijing as the]{.mark}
official [government of China. Yet]{.mark} Washington often
[made]{.mark} major [arms transfers]{.mark} like [fighter jets and
surface-to-air missile
systems](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1984/12/assessing-the-taiwan-relations-act)
[to
[Taiwan](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan-arms-idUSKBN0TZ2C520151216)
to reassure]{.mark} Taipei that the United States remained committed to
Taiwan's ability to defend itself against mainland China]{.underline}.
Following Obama's footsteps? Unlike his stance on Russia, Trump appears
to favor a more hawkish approach toward China, as evidence by his
comments on the [one-China
policy](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/world/asia/trump-taiwan-china.html).
Yet Trump's comments about burden-sharing by [Japan and South
Korea](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/31/politics/trump-view-from-south-korea-japan/)
create a tension because balancing against China would require
strengthening --- not weakening --- alliances with Japan and South
Korea. History suggests that [more arms sales to Taiwan are possible
because the cross-strait military balance is worsening due to China's
military modernization. The Trump administration might feel it necessary
to make [larger, more advanced, and more sustained arms
packages](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/16/politics/u-s-taiwan-arms-sales/index.html?eref=edition)
than those committed to by President Obama in 2015]{.underline}.
Moreover, despite calls for greater alliance burden-sharing by Japan and
South Korea, the new Trump administration might [invest more in those
alliances](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/05/10/the-art-of-the-military-deal/)
to maintain local military balances against China and North Korea,
respectively. In short, the [[Trump]{.mark} administration
[might]{.mark} end up [rely]{.mark}ing o[n arms transfers as its chief
tool of reassurance and deterrence]{.mark} from Europe to
Asia]{.underline}. In doing so, Trump would follow in the footsteps of
the [Obama administration, which authorized more arms sales than any
U.S. administration since [World War
II](http://www.defenseone.com/business/2016/11/obamas-final-arms-export-tally-more-doubles-bushs/133014/).
For alliance politics, [arms transfers might be the new art of the
deal]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales are key to defend allies

**Mrachek 17 (**Mrachek, Alexis, 12-12-2017, \"US Arms Sale to Georgia a
Long-Overdue Show of Support for Eurasian Ally,\" Daily
Signal, <https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/12/12/u-s-arms-sale-georgia-long-overdue-show-support-eurasian-ally/>)

The U.S.- Georgian relationship was taken to a new level on Nov. 20,
when President Donald Trump approved something that never occurred
during President Barack Obama's eight years in office. That would be an
estimated \$75 million deal to sell Javelin anti-tank missiles to the
Eastern European republic of Georgia. After [25 years of diplomatic
relations](http://www.heritage.org/global-politics/event/25-years-us-georgia-relations)
between the two nations, Tbilisi is more deserving than ever to receive
this kind of support. Georgia is a beacon of hope for the Eurasia region
and is a valued partner for the U.S. on a global scale. Since regaining
its independence in 1991, Georgia has worked hard to reform its economy
and governance---and with much success. The country has had successive
peaceful elections and is deeply committed to integrating into the West.
According to The Heritage Foundation's 2017 Index of Economic Freedom,
Georgia is [ranked](http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking) 13th in the
world for economic freedom, scoring even higher than the United States
itself. Georgia also has geostrategic importance for Europe's energy
security, since it's a key transit country for oil and gas pipelines to
Europe. [From 1991 to the present, [Georgia's democracy [has been
threatened](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/13/world/europe/2008-georgia-russia-conflict/index.html)
by Russia]{.mark} in numerous ways---from hybrid warfare to invasion.
Because of this, [Georgia deserves the chance to defend its borders and
its democracy against further Russian aggression]{.mark}. Thankfully,
[with the sale of these advanced anti-tank missiles, it can]{.mark}. The
weapons sale is important for two main reasons: symbolism and
practicality. The sale is symbolic, because [it demonstrates the U.S.'
support for Georgia and our alliance]{.mark}, while also being
practical, because Georgia can use the weapons for deterrence. In the
next few weeks, [the same
[decision](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-presented-47m-deal-arm-ukraine-russia/story?id=51235203)
should be made for Ukraine---to arm it with]{.mark} Javelin [missiles to
deter Russian aggression]{.mark}. Perhaps the most important reason why
Georgia deserves these weapons, however, is because it has proven itself
to be a dependable and responsible ally of the United States. An example
of that stems from the war in Afghanistan]{.underline}. Georgia's
[contribution](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-nato-military/georgian-soldier-killed-in-afghanistan-convoy-attack-coalition-idUSKBN1AJ2ZT)
has been the largest of any non-NATO member, with a total of 2,000
troops serving at the height of the war. Today, Georgia still maintains
more than 850 troops in Afghanistan. [Georgian troops have experienced
the highest per-capita death rates in Afghanistan, demonstrating their
dedication to helping the U.S. in the war against terrorism. It is
important to note that Georgia is unlikely to utilize the weapons to try
to take back its South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions, which Russia
illegally has been occupying [since
2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv00Weif0Sw).]{.underline} Since
then, Russia has been involved in what is called a "creeping
occupation," in which Russia takes just a bit of Georgian land at a
time, drawing very little attention to itself. [Each one of these acts
is a blatant violation of international law, and the occupation now has
become so domineering that [approximately 20
percent](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/08/putin-heads-to-occupied-georgia-territory-on-war-anniversary/)of
Georgian territory lies under Russian control. Nevertheless, Georgia
actually declared a "non-use of force" pledge, meaning that it only sees
a diplomatic outcome in regaining control of the two territories. Russia
has failed to reciprocate this pledge. The bottom line is that the
decision to sell these weapons is great news for Georgia, and [the U.S.
should continue to arm and enhance those capabilities]{.mark}. We should
do so not only for Georgia, but [for all of our allies---for the sake of
America's national security and prosperity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

During the 2016 US presidential campaign, then-candidate [Donald Trump
made comments alluding to his potential reorientation of US foreign
policy.]{.underline} He indicated that he was considering reducing the
United States' security commitment to US allies around the world. He
also expressed an openness to nuclear proliferation by US allies, South
Korea and Japan. These two statements together with the ["America First"
theme of his inauguration speech and his [recent canceling of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership]{.mark} all [indicate a general expectation
that Asian allies must do more for their own security.]{.mark} This
rhetoric echoes a previous period of US retrenchment in Asia. [In
1970]{.mark}, US President Richard [Nixon announced that]{.mark} US
[allies would need to take greater responsibility for their own
security]{.mark}. In response, **[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [began to
explore a nuclear weapons program]{.mark}.** This period of uncertainty
and its effects on nuclear proliferation may have lessons for today's
policymakers]{.underline}. Regardless of whether President Trump
implements a strategic redirection, it is useful to understand the
dynamics that drive nuclear proliferation by a dependent ally. Would a
reduction in US commitment to its allies lead to new or resumed nuclear
weapons programs? How important are security commitments to containing
nuclear proliferation? How does the US credibly signal commitment? These
questions bear directly on a current shift in US public feelings toward
foreign policy. The election of [Donald Trump on an "America First"
platform represents a reaction in public opinion [against globalization
and the extent of the US role in upholding a liberal international
order]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, mounting [[US debt and]{.mark}
the exponential [cost increase in maintaining qualitative military
superiority]{.mark} over peer rival [have caused]{.mark} many [Americans
to question the sustainability of]{.mark} US global [security
guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline}. These trends could augur a looming
retrenchment of US defense commitments. It is unknown what the second
order effect of such a US withdrawal would have on its allies' decisions
regarding nuclear weapons. [If one believes that nuclear
nonproliferation is in the United States' interest, then it is important
to understand how changes in US policy toward its security commitments
would affect global nuclear proliferation]{.underline}. I have written
this thesis to [bridge the gap between scholars of nuclear proliferation
and policymakers who must make decisions about conventional force
structure and deployment]{.underline}. In this thesis, I establish a
model that synthesizes and simplifies the security-based theories of
nuclear proliferation. From this model, one can discern the [role of US
military force posture in restraining proliferation by
allies]{.underline}. This will hopefully assist policymakers and
strategists in understanding whether and under what conditions changes
in one seemingly distinct area of conventional security policy can have
repercussions in the nuclear realm. The central argument of this thesis
is that **[[US allies pursue nuclear weapons when their perception of
their threat environment outweighs their perception of US security
commitment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I model this argument in terms of a
relationship between threat environment and US commitment. I argue that:
f(P) = T~p~ -- C~p~ or Proliferation = perceived Threat -- perceived
Commitment where P is a forward vector along a spectrum of nuclear
weapons activities. T~p~ and C~p~ are discrete values between 1 and 3
based on criteria for the perceived threat to the US ally and perceived
level of commitment by the United States. To test this model, I will
conduct a case study of South Korea's 1970's nuclear weapons policies as
responses to a change in the level of US commitment. This period,
initiated by [President [Nixon]{.mark}'s Guam Doctrine of [reduced US
security commitment in Asia, echoes the current environment of potential
US retrenchment and may provide insight into potential responses by
current US allies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} I have limited the
scope of this thesis only to US allies. The model presented here may be
generalizable to all great power-protectorate relationships, but it is
not the purpose of this thesis to prove that relationship. In addition,
this model does not delve below the state level to the
domestic/bureaucratic or individual psychological level. My analysis of
the nonproliferation research literature leads me to conclude that these
[individual and domestic level explanations are useful for understanding
how leaders and organizations translate systemic inputs into policy
outputs, but that [security factors best explain why states initiate or
resume nuclear weapons programs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Why do countries go nuclear?]{.underline}]{.mark} To answer the
question, many scholars suggest a variety of explanations. Sagan (1996)
first presented the systematic analysis of nuclear proliferation by
offering the three models of security, domestic politics, and norms.
[[First, the security model posits that nuclear weapons development is
associated with the **maximization of national security**]{.mark}
against security threats. [Second, the domestic politics model stresses
the political interests of actors]{.mark} within the state [in regard to
nuclear pursuit.]{.mark} Lastly, the norms model refers to norms and
shared beliefs about whether nuclear pursuit is "legitimate" and
"appropriate."]{.underline} Since Sagan (1996) suggested his three
theoretical models of nuclear proliferation were suggested, many
international relations scholars have conducted systematic and
quantitative examinations of causes of proliferation to find causal
factors that drive nuclear weapons proliferation. This chapter presents
a review of the existing literature on nuclear proliferation as it
pertains demand and supply frameworks (Sagan 2011). [[The demand-side
explanation refers to the motivation]{.mark} or intention [to acquire
nuclear weapons]{.mark} while the supply-side one is associated with the
available resources for nuclear weapons development. The **demand-side
[factors include]{.mark}, for instance, [security threats]{.mark}, the
security [guarantee/ defensive alliance]{.mark} from a nuclear-armed
state, [and domestic political constraints]{.mark}**. The supply-side
factors include economic conditions, nuclear technology, and foreign
nuclear cooperation/assistance.]{.underline} The Demand-Side Explanation
This section lays out how the demand-side conditions influence states'
nuclear behaviors. In particular, how do security threats and domestic
political concerns influence states' decisions regarding going nuclear?
**[[First, states attempt to]{.mark} develop or [obtain nuclear weapons
for national security]{.mark} purposes.]{.underline}** A large
proportion of existing proliferation literature relies on the security
model (Bowen and Kidd 2004; Ogilvie-White 1996; Paul 2000; Sagan 1996).
[[States seek]{.mark} nuclear [bombs when they face a]{.mark}
significant conventional or nuclear [threat to their security, which
cannot be met by]{.mark} existing [conventional
forces]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sagan 1996). Such a security-based
explanation for nuclear arms has been strongly supported by the
realist/neorealist tradition in international relations. For
realists/neorealists, [the [nuclear weapons possession is regarded as
the rational behavior to protect national interests-state
survival-against potential threats in the international
system]{.mark}]{.underline} (Jo and Gartzke 2007; Ogilvie-White 1996;
Singh and Way 2004). [Any state that seeks to maintain its national
security must come up with a counterbalance to any rival state that
develops nuclear weapons; the counterbalance involves gaining access to
a nuclear deterrent. In this respect, the acquisition of nuclear weapons
plays a role in deterring the adversaries.]{.underline} Within the
international system, the serious concerns about national survival lead
states to maximize power and to try to become the most powerful nation
in the regional or world (Mearsheimer 2003). [In this context, states
seek nuclear weapons to maximize national security and deter foreign
attacks. **[Second, forming a defense pact with a nuclear weapons
state]{.mark} or with the dominant state [reduces a state's motivation
to acquire nuclear arms]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bleek and Lorber 2014;
Jo and Gartzke 2007; Singh and Way 2004). [This is not only because a
state does not have an incentive to possess nuclear weapons due to
nuclear umbrella but also because [the powerful nuclear weapons state
discourages a state from developing a nuclear weapons
program]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, Singh and Way (2004, 863)
argued that ["a credible security guarantee from a powerful state can
dull the desire for nuclear weapons."]{.underline} Jo and Gartzke (2007,
170) claimed that ["[states with security commitments]{.mark} from
patrons with nuclear weapons [may be less likely to
proliferate]{.mark}."]{.underline} In contrast, Reiter (2014) found
empirical evidence that neither alliances nor foreign-deployed troops
reduces an alliance-partner's motive to develop nuclear weapons.
[However, the variable of foreign-deployed nuclear weapons is the strong
predictor of decreasing the proliferation intention. A nuclear umbrella
can provide a non-nuclear alliance partner with the extended nuclear
deterrence.]{.underline} In a similar logic, Gerzhoy (2015) developed
the logic of alliance coercion and argued, based on it, that [[a nuclear
aspiring **ally is compelled to withdraw its nuclear weapons program due
to its** ]{.mark}**nuclear [patron's threats of military
abandonment]{.mark}.**]{.underline} However, even if in history alliance
restraints on a state's nuclear weapons program is substantial, it is
just effective on a state within defensive alliances and during the Cold
War.5 After the end of Cold War, most nuclear arms seekers were states
without alliance and so-called rogue states-Iran and North Korea, for
instance. Alliance factor may have a limited influence on nuclear
proliferation in regard to country characteristics and changes in
international structure. **[[Third, domestic-political explanations
assume that the decision to go nuclear depends]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} the
[strategic games over policy makings among]{.mark} domestic political
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Jo and Gartzke 2007; Paul 2000; Sagan
1996; Singh and Way 2004). Domestic political factors do not necessarily
affect a state's nuclear ambition in one direction. Domestic politics
may encourage or discourage a state's nuclear arms development (Sagan
1996, 63). For instance, according to Gray (1999), [nuclear weapons
programs are essentially based on their domestic process]{.underline}.
Sathasivam (2003) argued that, [[in]{.mark} the case of [Pakistan, the
domestic power interest group forced the Pakistani government to build
and test nuclear arms in response to India's acquisition of nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of Japan, the domestic
constitution, legislation, and non-nuclear principles restrain Japan
from building nuclear. Since 1945, a list of countries that tried but
gave up nuclear weapons development includes many countries allied with
the United States - Argentina, Brazil, Canada, West Germany, Italy,
Japan, Netherlands, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan (Levite 2002, 300).
14 weapons (Hughes 2007). In particular, three non-nuclear principles
include "not manufacturing, possessing, or importing nuclear weapons"
(Hughes 2007, 85).

[[Most countries have renounced nuclear weapons]{.mark}, recognising
that proliferation of them [would threaten]{.mark} rather than enhance
[national security. They]{.mark} have therefore [embraced]{.mark} the
[NPT as a public commitment to use nuclear materials]{.mark} and
technology [only for peaceful purposes]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
successful conclusion, in 1968, of negotiations on the NPT (following
resolution of the United Nations General Assembly) was a landmark in the
history of non-proliferation. After coming into force in 1970, its
indefinite extension in May 1995 was another. The NPT was essentially an
agreement among the five nuclear weapons states and the other countries
interested in nuclear technology. The deal was that assistance and
cooperation would be traded for pledges, backed by international
scrutiny, that no plant or material would be diverted to weapons\' use.
Those who refused to be part of the deal would be excluded from
international cooperation or trade involving nuclear technology. At
present, 189 states plus Taiwan are parties to the NPT. These include
all five declared Nuclear Weapons States (NWS) which had manufactured
and exploded a nuclear weapon before 1967: China, France, the Russian
Federation, the UK and the USA. The main countries remaining outside the
NPT are Israel, India and Pakistan, though North Korea has moved to join
them. These all have weapons programs which have come to maturity since
1970, so they cannot join without renouncing and dismantling those. In
2008 special arrangements were agreed internationally for India,
bringing it part way in, and its ratification of the Additional Protocol
in 2014 put it on a similar footing to the five NWS. Overall, 182 states
plus Taiwan have safeguards agreements with the IAEA in force, and 129
have Additional Protocols in force. [The [NPT\'s main objectives are to
stop the spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons, [to provide security for
non-nuclear]{.mark} weapon [states]{.mark} which have given up the
nuclear option, [to encourage international co-op]{.mark}eration [in the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to pursue negotiations in good
faith towards]{.mark} nuclear [disarmament leading to]{.mark} the
eventual [elimination]{.mark} of nuclear weapons. **[The most important
factor underpinning the safeguards regime is international political
pressure and how]{.mark} particular [nations perceive their long-term
security interests in relation to their immediate
neighbours.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The solution to nuclear weapons
proliferation is thus political more than technical, and it certainly
goes beyond the question of uranium availability. [International
pressure not to acquire weapons is enough to deter most states from
developing a weapons program. **[The major risk of]{.mark} nuclear
weapons\' [prolif]{.mark}eration [will]{.mark} always [lie with]{.mark}
countries which have not joined the NPT and which have significant
unsafeguarded nuclear activities, and [those which have joined but
disregard their treaty commitments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For further

to this paper. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) The IAEA
was set up by unanimous resolution of the United Nations in 1957 to help
nations develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Allied to this
role since 1970 is the administration of safeguards arrangements. This
provides assurance to the international community that individual
countries are honouring their treaty commitments to use nuclear
materials and facilities exclusively for peaceful purposes. The IAEA
therefore undertakes regular inspections of civil nuclear facilities to
verify the accuracy of documentation supplied to it. The agency checks
inventories and undertakes sampling and analysis of materials.
Safeguards are designed to deter diversion of nuclear material by
increasing the risk of early detection. They are complemented by
controls on the export of sensitive technology from countries such as UK
and USA through voluntary bodies such as the Nuclear Suppliers\' Group.
Safeguards are backed up by the threat of international sanctions. Scope
of safeguards [It is important to understand that [nuclear safeguards
are]{.mark} a means of [reassurance whereby non-nuclear weapons states
demonstrate]{.mark} to others [that they are abiding by their peaceful
commitments]{.mark}. They prevent nuclear proliferation in the same way
that auditing procedures build confidence in proper financial conduct
and prevent embezzlement.]{.underline} Their specific objective is to
verify whether declared (usually traded) nuclear material remains within
the civil nuclear fuel cycle and is being used solely for peaceful
purposes or not. Non-nuclear-weapons state parties to the NPT agree to
accept technical safeguards measures applied by the IAEA. These require
that operators of nuclear facilities maintain and declare detailed
accounting records of all movements and transactions involving nuclear
material. Almost 900 nuclear facilities and several hundred other
locations in 57 non-nuclear-weapons countries are subject to regular
inspection. Their records and the actual nuclear material are audited.
Inspections by the IAEA are complemented by other measures such as
surveillance cameras and instrumentation. The aim of traditional IAEA
safeguards is to deter the diversion of nuclear material from peaceful
use by maximising the risk of early detection. [At a broader level they
provide assurance to the international community that countries are
honouring their treaty commitments to use nuclear materials and
facilities exclusively for peaceful purposes. In this way [safeguards
are a service both to the international community and to individual
states, who recognise that it is in their own interest to demonstrate
compliance with these commitments]{.mark}.]{.underline} The inspections
act as an alert system providing a warning of the possible diversion of
nuclear material from peaceful activities. The system relies on;
Material Accountability -- tracking all inward and outward transfers and
the flow of materials in any nuclear facility. This includes sampling
and analysis of nuclear material, on-site inspections, review and
verification of operating records. Physical Security -- restricting
access to nuclear materials at the site of use. Containment and
Surveillance -- use of seals, automatic cameras and other instruments to
detect unreported movement or tampering with nuclear materials, as well
as spot checks on-site. All NPT non-weapons states must accept these
\'full-scope\' safeguards, which apply to all nuclear facilities in the
country. In the five weapons states plus the non-NPT states (India,
Pakistan and Israel), facility-specific safeguards apply to relevant
plants (see further section below). IAEA inspectors regularly visit
these facilities to verify completeness and accuracy of records. Uranium
supplied to nuclear weapons states is not, under the NPT, covered by
safeguards. However normally there is at least a \"peaceful use\" clause
in the supply contract, and in the case of Australia, a bilateral
safeguards agreement is required which does cover all uranium supplied
and all materials arising from it (as \"Australian obligated nuclear
materials\" -- AONM). Neither the peaceful use clause nor the bilateral
treaty mean that materials are restricted to facilities on the state\'s
list of facilities eligible for IAEA inspection. The NPT is supplemented
by other safeguards systems such as those among certain European nations
(Euratom Safeguards) and between individual countries (bilateral
agreements) such as Australia and customer countries for its uranium, or
Japan and the USA. The terms of the NPT cannot be enforced by the IAEA
itself, nor can nations be forced to sign the treaty. In reality, as
shown in Iran and North Korea, safeguards are backed up by diplomatic,
political and economic measures. Safeguards problems 1980s-90s [[[Iraq,
Iran and No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/non-proliferation/appendices/nuclear-proliferation-case-studies.aspx)
[illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of international
safeguards]{.mark}. While accepting safeguards at declared facilities,
[Iraq and Iran had set up elaborate equipment elsewhere in an attempt to
enrich uranium]{.mark}, in Iraq\'s case, to weapons grade.
[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [used research reactors]{.mark} (not
commercial electricity-generating reactors) [and a reprocessing plant to
produce]{.mark} some weapons-grade [plutonium]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
weakness of the NPT regime lay in the fact that no obvious diversion of
material was involved. The uranium used as fuel probably came from
indigenous sources, and the key nuclear facilities concerned were built
by the countries themselves without being declared to the IAEA or placed
safeguards arrangements. Iraq, as an NPT party, was obliged to declare
all facilities but did not do so. Nor, more recently, did Iran. In North
Korea, the activities concerned took place before the conclusion of its
NPT safeguards agreement, using a Russian \"research\" reactor and
clandestine reprocessing plant. [Nevertheless, the activities were
detected and in Iraq and North Korea, brought under control using
international diplomacy. In Iraq, a military defeat assisted this
process, but North Korea posed possibly the most intractable situation
confronted by the IAEA. This has since been matched by
Iran.]{.underline} So, while traditional safeguards easily verified the
correctness of formal declarations by suspect states, in the 1990s
attention turned to what might not have been declared, outside the known
materials flows and facilities. Addressing undeclared nuclear activities
-- the Additional Protocol Following discovery of Iraq\'s clandestine
programme, in 1993 a programme was initiated to strengthen and extend
the classical safeguards system, and a model protocol was agreed by the
IAEA Board of Governors in 1997. This was to boost the IAEA\'s ability
to detect undeclared nuclear activities, including those with no
connection to the civil fuel cycle. Innovations were of two kinds. Some
could be implemented on the basis of IAEA\'s existing legal authority
through safeguards agreements and inspections. Others required further
legal authority to be conferred through an Additional Protocol. This
must be agreed by each non-weapons state with IAEA, as a supplement to
their existing comprehensive safeguards agreement. NPT Weapons States
(and India) have also agreed to accept the principles of the model
Additional Protocol, though the function there is different. Key
elements of the model Additional Protocol: The IAEA is given
considerably more information on nuclear and nuclear-related activities,
including R&D, production of uranium and thorium (regardless of whether
it is traded) and nuclear-related imports and exports. IAEA inspectors
have greater rights of access. This includes any suspect location, at
short notice (e.g. two hours), and the IAEA can deploy environmental
sampling and remote monitoring techniques to detect illicit activities.
States must streamline administrative procedures so that IAEA inspectors
get automatic visa renewal and can communicate more readily with IAEA
headquarters. All these elements enhance the IAEA\'s ability to provide
assurances that all nuclear activities and material in the country
concerned has been declared for safeguards purposes. As of October 2016,
129 states plus Taiwan, Greenland and Euratom had Additional Protocols
in force, and 17 more including Belarus and Iran had them approved and
signed but not yet in force. Iran has said it was applying the
Additional Protocol provisionally from January 2016. There are 70 states
plus Taiwan with significant nuclear activities. Those remaining without
an Additional Protocol include Israel, Pakistan and North Korea -- all
outside the NPT anyway. (See IAEA webpage on [Status of the Additional
Protocol](https://www.iaea.org/topics/additional-protocol/status).)
Further evolution of safeguards is towards evaluation of each state,
taking account of its particular situation and the kind of nuclear
materials it has. This will involve greater judgement on the part of
IAEA and the development of effective methodologies which reassure NPT
States. Where non-weapons states have a safeguards agreement with the
IAEA and an Additional Protocol in force, the IAEA is able to say each
year not only that declared nuclear material remains in peaceful
activities, but also that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or
activities. For Nuclear Weapons States, the purpose of the Additional
Protocol is different, namely to provide the IAEA with information on
nuclear supply to, and cooperation with, non-weapons states. Such
information assists the IAEA in its objective of detecting any
undeclared activities in non-weapons states. (In this context India is
understood to be effectively a Nuclear Weapons State, and the Additional
Protocol for it was agreed by the IAEA in March 2009, and ratified by
India in June 2014.) Limitations of safeguards Apart from situations
addressed by the Additional Protocol, [the greatest risk of nuclear
weapons proliferation lies with countries which have not joined the NPT
and which have significant unsafeguarded nuclear activities. India,
Pakistan and Israel are in this category. While safeguards apply to some
of their activities, others remain beyond scrutiny. **A further concern
is that** **[countries may develop various sensitive nuclear fuel cycle
facilities and research reactors under full safeguards and then
subsequently opt out of the NPT]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Bilateral
agreements such as insisted upon by Australia and Canada for sale of
uranium address this by including fallback provisions, but many
countries are outside the scope of these agreements. If a
nuclear-capable country does leave the NPT it is likely to be reported
by the IAEA to the UN Security Council, just as if it were in breach of
its safeguards agreement. Trade sanctions would then be likely.

In the nuclear age, states facing acute external threats can adopt a
range of policies to increase their security, including developing
nuclear weapons or allying with a state that possesses them.5
[Possessing nuclear weapons allows states to deter adversaries with the
threat of significant reprisal]{.underline} (Brodie 1974). But nuclear
proliferation is a costly strategy. Nuclear weapons are technically
difficult to produce, require the establishment of expensive programs,
can cause significant political rifts with allies, and may motivate
rivals to proliferate (Schwartz 1998; Oberdorfer 2001). By allying with
a patron that has nuclear weapons, [[a state can]{.mark} enjoy many of
[the deterrent benefits of the patron\'s nuclear weapons while not
paying the costs]{.mark} associated [with developing its own. A security
guarantee serves as a substitute for]{.mark} a state [obtaining nuclear
weapons; a potential]{.mark} challenger [to the protégé state will
observe that a nuclear-armed patron protects the protégé and
will]{.mark} therefore [be less likely to]{.mark} threaten or
[attack]{.mark} the protégé]{.underline} (Huth 1988). Yet from the
perspective of the protégé state, **[[this strategy entails risks, most
importantly the potential for abandonment]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Snyder
1984). Because allies can abandon protégés in the face of threats,
[protégé states can never feel completely secure]{.underline} (Goldstein
2000). [For states where the risk of abandonment is perceived to be
high]{.underline}, or the technological, economic, and political
constraints on proliferation are low, [security guarantees are less
likely to be viewed as viable]{.underline} substitutes for
proliferation. [Conversely, [for states that perceive the likelihood of
**abandonment as low**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the technological,
economic, and political constraints on proliferation as high, [[security
guarantees are more likely to be perceived as viable
alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark} to proliferation. Security guarantees
decrease the risk of proliferation by decreasing the likelihood of
abandonment; according to Leeds, Long, and Mitchell (2000), **[[states
honor their alliance commitments over 70 percent of the
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Guarantees decrease the likelihood of
abandonment for at least two reasons. [First, though a [patron]{.mark}
can always renege on its obligations, [states may be reluctant]{.mark}
to do so [for fear of weakening]{.mark} the perceived strength of other
commitments]{.underline} (Schelling 1966). [Second, [breaking the
military commitment may have negative effects on the nonmilitary

**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S. has significant disputes with
the People's Republic over trade imbalances, cyber-intrusions,
intellectual property theft, North Korean bad behavior, and Beijing's
territorial claims over the South China Sea. [It is certainly tempting
for the U.S. to use Taiwan as leverage in dealing with those issues,
e.g. telling China to modulate its positions favorably for the U.S. in
return for lessened U.S. support to the island]{.underline}. When he was
president-elect, Donald Trump [mused about doing exactly
that](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/11/us/politics/trump-taiwan-one-china.html),
and as the trade dispute heats up, that temptation will grow. **[That
would be a significant mistake.]{.underline}** [[Taiwan has been
a]{.mark} **steadfast supporter**]{.underline} [of the U.S. for
decades,]{.underline} [and continues to perform as a **[staunch
ally]{.mark}** in a very turbulent and vital geopolitical
arena]{.underline}. [[A]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[betrayal of
trust]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} [[have a
**ripple effect globally,** ]{.mark}**further [degrading U.S.
credibility as an ally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It also misreads
Beijing's intent and attitude --- China has no interest in a deal
involving Taiwan. The claim to the island is the ultimate red line in
its foreign policy, and it is especially true that a nationalist
government like Xi's will not be part of a negotiation involving
Taiwan's status. The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
[must]{.underline} come to understand the overarching importance China
places on eventually incorporating Taiwan into its governance structure,
and display sophistication and strategic patience with the situation.
This means [follow]{.underline}ing [the approach to Taiwan that has been
in place for **decades** with bipartisan support]{.underline}:
[helping]{.underline} [**Taiwan** militarily]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} sensible levels of **[advanced military
sales]{.underline}** [following the mandate of the [Taiwan Relations
Act](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-taiwan-relations-act/)]{.underline};
providing political support internationally, such as helping Taiwan
participate in international organizations even though it is not
universally recognized as a sovereign state; and encouraging robust
economic exchanges between the two nations. Good examples of this are
the recent sale of \$1.4 billion in advanced military hardware that was
announced in 2017, and allowing high-level official visits between the
Taiwan and the U.S. as permitted under the [Taiwan Travel
Act](https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-travel-act/4302881.html), which
was passed this spring. The U.S. should also encourage allies, partners
and friends in the Indo-Pacific region to engage with Taiwan. Having
better economic ties, and perhaps joint military training, between
Taiwan and India, Japan and especially the nations around the littoral
of the South China Sea would help maintain a balance between the
People's Republic and Taiwan. So long as China sees that Taiwan has
robust relations in the region it is unlikely to do anything precipitous
that could provoke a military confrontation. During my recent visit,
which was sponsored by both a U.S. and a Taiwanese think tank, I met
with many senior officials from the government, military and private
sector. The general tone is that Taiwan wants to stay cautious, balanced
and sensible in its approach, and is clearly looking for peaceful
outcomes. I heard from Taiwanese leaders that they don't want to fight
China, and they value a status quo that provides them the benefits of
democracy and free markets. But they are nervous as they see China
ratcheting up pressure militarily, diplomatically and economically. Over
time, the choices ahead about the status of Taiwan must be made by the
people of Taiwan, without fear or favor in reaction to pressure from
across the strait. [The **[Trump]{.mark}** administration [is]{.mark}
**[so far]{.mark}** [taking a **sensible approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} supporting the island and [[providing
**advanced technology**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[for **defensive military
systems**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It must resist the temptation to use
Taiwan as a bargaining chip with China. While undermining Taiwan in that
way could provide some short-term relief on knotty problems between the
two superpowers, it would be self-defeating over the longer term.

Some observers argue the prospects for nuclear proliferation among U.S.
allies appear to have heightened in recent years. Superficially, U.S.
President Donald Trump may be responsible. During his 2016 presidential
campaign, he made statements suggesting he might tolerate efforts by
Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. His criticisms of NATO
and some of its members have fueled debate in Germany on the
desirability and feasibility of the "nuclear option." Looking more
broadly, since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. has had to grapple
with the management of its security ties abroad amid mounting budgetary
deficits and growing public weariness of so-called "forever wars." And
yet, over two years into the Trump administration[, [little nuclear
prolif]{.mark}eration-related activity [seems to be taking place among
U.S. allies]{.mark}. In fact, [some of]{.mark} the [most
powerful]{.mark} U.S. [allies]{.mark}---Japan and Germany---[have
largely moved away from nuclear energy]{.mark}]{.underline}. What lies
behind this current scenario? Perhaps one answer is that the [U.S
[military deployments that underscore U.S. security commitments remain
strong]{.mark}. But how do security guarantees relate to nuclear
proliferation? Presidential rhetoric may be important for evaluating the
strength of a treaty pledge by the U.S. to defend an ally in the event
of attack by a potential adversary like Russia]{.underline}, North Korea
or China. However, whether it is more important than other
considerations is debatable, since [presidential [rhetoric may
simply]{.mark} [be]{.mark} just that: [rhetoric. A verbal]{.mark}ly
cited [promise to follow through]{.mark} on any pledges recorded in
print [is]{.mark} simply [hard to believe. No country wants to risk the
safety of]{.mark} ~~his or her~~ [\[their\]]{.mark}country's [cities for
an ally]{.mark}, if they can help it]{.underline}. How can a state,
therefore, have any sort of confidence in its alliances? Thankfully,
there is a way. [The U.S. deploys a wide range of military forces to
shore up local defense and deterrence measures to augment the security
of its allies and to advance its own national security interests. U.S.
forces stationed in South Korea and Japan, for example, are there for
regional contingency if North Korea and/or China were to commit an act
of aggression---not to serve as potential targets to trigger wider
retaliation by Washington]{.underline}, per the logic of trip-wires.
They are also there to kill, making it hard for any potential aggressor
to go successfully on the attack without incurring unacceptable costs.
[[So long as the U.S. has]{.mark} such [forces on]{.mark} its [ally's
territory]{.mark}, or in the theater of operations where a potential war
would be fought, [the security guarantee is sufficiently strong to have
the confidence of]{.mark} its [beneficiaries]{.mark}. [It]{.mark}
i[s]{.mark} [when the]{.mark} U.S. [has]{.mark} unilaterally
[reduced]{.mark} its [forward deployments that]{.mark} its [allies
become]{.mark} so [alarmed they are]{.mark} [**tempted to acquire
nuclear weapons to ensure their own security**. A case in point is South
Korea in the]{.mark} 19[70s]{.mark}]{.underline}. As it does now,
[[South Korea benefited from a treaty promising]{.mark} that [Washington
would defend it]{.mark} against external aggression]{.underline}. But
when President Richard Nixon came into office in 1969, he spoke of how
partners in East Asia and elsewhere would need to bear more of the
collective defense burden, especially in light of its failures in
Vietnam, [rising anti-war sentiment at home and the downturn in the U.S.
economy. Yet, the South Korean President at the time---[Park]{.mark}
Chung-hee---was unfazed by]{.underline} Nixon's rhetoric[. He
[believed]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
would reward his country for its contributions in the Vietnam War by
[retain]{.mark}ing its [large military presence]{.mark} on the Korean
Peninsula. President [Park's]{.mark} [optimism was misplaced]{.mark}. In
July 1970, [Nixon announced that the U.S. would]{.mark} unilaterally
[withdraw]{.mark} 20,000 of its military personnel from South Korea
within a year, cutting the total U.S. military presence on the peninsula
by one-third]{.underline}. The balance of power implications were
potentially significant. Since more troop reductions were now
conceivable, [South Korea would become newly vulnerable to North
Korea---an adversary that, at the time, was relatively more
industrialized, enjoyed Chinese and Soviet patronage, had a stronger
conventional military and had engaged in highly provocative but
low-level military activities across the Demilitarized Zone]{.underline}
against the South since 1966. [Against this backdrop, President [Park
put South Korea on the path towards]{.mark} acquiring [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. This project failed partly because South
Korea needed outside sources for credit and access to reprocessing and
enrichment facilities---a vulnerability that the United States used to
its advantage to get its ally to curb its activities and to make
nonproliferation commitments. Still, South Korea has had persistent
interest in fissile materials since the 1970s and continues to undertake
continued pyroprocessing activities. Today, [South Korea may not be on
an aggressive path to acquiring nuclear weapons, but [its apparent
desire]{.mark} to seek some advantage [demonstrates]{.mark} that
[security guarantees---**once broken**]{.mark}---[can be]{.mark} very
[difficult to repair]{.mark}]{.underline}, [thus [prompting countries
to]{.mark} re[consider the nuclear]{.mark} [option]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The [So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rean case [illuminates why we]{.mark} are
[see]{.mark}ing [no]{.mark} new [efforts to get nuclear weapons]{.mark},
at least by U.S. treaty allies, in the age of Trump. When one looks
beyond the rhetoric, [actions speak volumes]{.mark}. The Trump
administration has reinforced U.S. force posture with additional
deployments to Germany]{.underline}. It is seriously considering a
permanent military presence in neighboring Poland. Present relations
with South Korea have been rocky, but the Trump administration did sign
an updated free trade agreement, as well as a temporary agreement, to
help cover the costs of 28,500 military personnel stationed there. The
U.S. military presence in Japan has remained steady. Indeed, [if Trump
is serious about containing China, the U.S. military presence will
likely increase in East Asia over the long-term. Dramatic, unilateral
troop [withdrawals under]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration
[are]{.mark} still [possible, but]{.mark} the [historical record
indicates that such attempts are]{.mark} generally [made early]{.mark}
in a presidency [rather than later]{.mark}. Nixon, for instance,
announced his troop withdrawal out of Vietnam within eighteen months of
coming into office. Putting all rhetoric aside, [if the]{.mark} military
[foundations of U.S. security guarantees remain strong, nuclear
proliferation among allies remains unlikely.]{.mark}]{.underline}

continue to do so\

Strength and Alliance Relationships: The World\'s Most Successful
Nonproliferation Tools?,\"
https://www.state.gov/u-s-strength-and-alliance-relationships-the-worlds-most-successful-nonproliferation-tools/)

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you, Peter, for your kind
introduction. In my line of work, I speak frequently about the
importance of the global nonproliferation regime, and about the security
benefits that institutions such as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
(NPT) provide to all States Party -- and indeed, especially to the
non-nuclear weapon states, insofar as the nonproliferation regime helps
keep their regional neighbors and rivals from acquiring nuclear
weapons[. I also emphasize that it is the foundation of nonproliferation
commitments and of standards for nuclear safety and security practices
provided by that regime that makes worldwide sharing the benefits of
peaceful nuclear technology possible and helps create the possibility of
moving further toward nuclear disarmament.]{.underline} In my corner of
the State Department, we work continually to maintain and improve the
nonproliferation norms, institutions, and practices that help make all
this possible. [Nevertheless, I'd like to speak today about
[a]{.mark}nother [critical]{.mark} [aspect of]{.mark} the [global
nonproliferation]{.mark} regime, albeit one that isn't frequently talked
as such. I refer to [the United States' alliance]{.mark}
[relationships]{.mark}, and to the deterrence and reassurance dynamics
that result from our maintenance of a strong conventional and nuclear
military posture.]{.underline} To be sure, U.S. officials frequently
refer to the impact our global "extended deterrence" relationships have
had over the decades in helping prevent nuclear weapons proliferation.
[One hears this less, though, from foreign officials, and people don't
usually talk of U.S. military power and alliance relationships as being
part of the global nonproliferation regime itself. But I would submit
that [this aspect of the nonproliferation regime is exceedingly
important]{.mark}, and should be discussed more widely.]{.underline} I'd
like to dwell on this theme a little bit today, to you here at this
breakfast, for I believe that no serious understanding of the global
nonproliferation regime can ignore the importance and the impact of U.S.
power as a nonproliferation tool. [In fact, [U.S. power is perhaps the
world's most successful nonproliferation tool]{.mark} -- and we should
not let ourselves forget this.]{.underline} Students of Cold War nuclear
history will know that highly classified U.S. intelligence estimates of
proliferation potential in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the danger
that many countries would develop nuclear weapons. A number of National
Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) from the period have been declassified and
publicly released, and you can find them on line fairly easily. If you
do, you'll see an amazing number of places identified during those years
as likely to acquire the ability to develop such weapons -- and perhaps
indeed increasingly likely to choose to do so as others progressively
weaponized. NIEs from that era, for instance, discuss the possibility of
weaponization in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia,
France, East Germany, West Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Japan, Pakistan, Poland, South Africa, Sweden,
Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Arab Republic (that is, present-day
Egypt and Syria). Thank goodness, nothing nearly so dramatic as that
potential cascade of proliferation actually occurred, though of course a
small number of countries did eventually end up weaponizing.
Commentators are quite right to give much credit for this to the NPT --
which entered into force half a century ago next year -- and to the
institutions built up around and in relation to that treaty. And they do
deserve much credit for forestalling the proliferation catastrophe that
was initially feared. But it is not the NPT alone that deserves credit.
To give further credit where it is due, the Soviet Union actually
helped, by policing its allies during the Cold War to prevent them from
developing independent nuclear weapons capabilities. Of course, one
might have wished that Moscow had been less willing to support and
encourage China's nuclear weapons program in the 1950s -- but at least
Nikita Khrushchev eventually thought better of this before fulfilling
his previous promise to give Beijing a prototype nuclear weapon just
before Mao Zedong began starving millions of his subjects to death
during the so-called "Great Leap Forward." On the whole, however, the
Soviets quite properly recognized their own interest -- and a common
global interest -- in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,
and Moscow was for the most part willing to act on this understanding,
not least in cooperating with the United States in jointly drafting the
NPT. One might also wish that modern China and Russia took
nonproliferation more seriously today. Beijing's continued willingness
to permit Chinese serial proliferators, such as Li Fangwei (also known
as Karl Lee) to engage in transfers to Iran's ballistic missile program
-- and Moscow's current diplomatic assault upon global institutions for
WMD control and accountability at the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons, the United Nations, and the International Atomic
Energy Agency -- are nothing short of shameful. Whatever the reasons for
this behavior -- whether it is mere laxity in support of
nonproliferation norms or deliberate efforts to appease their clients
and counter U.S. influence -- I think history will not treat them kindly
for undermining the U.S.-led world order that has kept the peace and
ensured prosperity since the Second World War. But Soviet power, at
least, does deserve some credit for helping forestall the cascade of
proliferation of which those early U.S. NIEs warned. [That said,
however, it is worth stressing the great -- and, ultimately, much more
important -- degree to which [United States alliances and military
posture]{.mark}, both conventional and nuclear, [played a pivotal role
in preventing]{.mark} the worst of what the Central Intelligence Agency
worried in a 1966 NIE could be [a cascade of]{.mark} "snowballing" of
[proliferation]{.mark}. Remembering the potency of U.S. global power as
a nonproliferation tool is important not just so that we can really
understand this history, but also because [U.S. power is still a
potent]{.mark} [nonproliferation tool in ways that it would be
unwise]{.mark}, or perhaps tragic, [for]{.mark} present-day
[policymakers]{.mark} and the public to forget or [to
dismiss]{.mark}.]{.underline} If you think back over the list I just
read of the governments the 1950s and 1960s NIEs identified as potential
future proliferators, I think it will be hard not to be struck by the
extent to which many of them ended up being covered in various formal or
informal ways under the so-called "nuclear umbrella" of U.S. "extended
deterrence" during the Cold War, and thereafter. [[For quite a few
countries, U.S.]{.mark} security [relationships]{.mark} [were critical
factors in persuading them that]{.mark}, notwithstanding their growing
degree of technological sophistication and access to the requisite
materials, [nuclear weaponization was unnecessary]{.mark} and needlessly
risky.]{.underline} As a serving U.S. government official, I have to be
careful about what I say in this regard, but these issues have been
discussed and documented in the academic literature for some years -- so
I would encourage you to consult such works to fill in any gaps that I
may have to leave here today. [But [it is notably clear]{.mark} now not
only [that]{.mark} quite a few countries were forestalled from beginning
to explore indigenous weaponization as a result of U.S. security
guarantees, but also that a combination of [U.S. security]{.mark}
assurances and diplomatic pressure not to weaponize [led a number of
countries]{.mark} actually [to]{.mark} [abandon nuclear weapons programs
that were]{.mark} already [underway]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Nonproliferation norms do not enforce themselves, and it is important to
remember the critical role that U.S. power and diplomacy played in
preventing the number of nuclear weapons possessors in the world today
from being considerably higher. U.S. military posture helped forestall
certain countries' weaponization choices in various ways. NATO's
so-called "nuclear burden sharing" that entails the forward deployment
of U.S. non-strategic nuclear weapons to Europe as a component of NATO's
nuclear deterrent, for instance, was designed to enhance deterrence by
confronting the Soviets with a higher likelihood of nuclear response to
any territorial aggression against NATO, even if Moscow's
intercontinental assets were somehow to deter an American strategic
response because this might lead to retaliation against U.S. cities. But
this arrangement also had the clear purpose of promoting
nonproliferation, inasmuch as it helped persuade NATO allies that their
security needs could and would be met without the need for indigenous
nuclear weaponization, despite persistent threats from Moscow. NATO's
ultimate choice of this nuclear policy, in other words, augmented both
deterrence and nonproliferation -- in both cases, thankfully, quite
successfully. Tellingly, Moscow, itself recognized and accepted this
enormous nonproliferation benefit from NATO's nuclear policy, despite
efforts by the current Russian regime to pretend otherwise. This can
clearly be seen in now-declassified NATO and U.S. documents, such as the
records from the U.S.-Soviet working group on negotiating the language
that ultimately became Article I of the NPT. Specifically, a September
1966 memorandum from that working group memorializes the Soviet
delegation's abandonment of its previous insistence upon language that
would not only have prohibited the transfer to any non-nuclear weapon
state of nuclear weapons themselves or control over them (as the NPT
currently does), but also would have prevented consultation and planning
for contingencies. This is why the NPT's Article I has never presented
any legal bar to NATO's nuclear policy. One can attribute the 1966
Soviet concession in large part to Moscow's grudging appreciation that
NATO's approach was key to dissuading NATO countries such as West
Germany from pursuing weaponization of their own -- as well as of the
fact that the alternative to having NATO nuclear sharing blessed by
Article I was something Moscow liked even less, namely, the then
proposed "Multilateral Nuclear Force." [But the nonproliferation benefit
of U.S. military power and security policy was not limited to NATO
members alone. Elsewhere in Western Europe outside NATO, U.S. security
assurances helped lead to the abandonment of exploratory nuclear weapons
programs in multiple additional countries. [In East Asi]{.mark}a, too,
at least [two]{.mark} [governments abandoned]{.mark} their [nuclear
weapons programs as a result of]{.mark} a combination of U.S. pressure
and [U.S. military reassurances]{.mark}.]{.underline}

successfully. Tellingly, Moscow, itself recognized and accepted this
enormous nonproliferation benefit from NATO's nuclear policy, despite
efforts by the current Russian regime to pretend otherwise. This can
clearly be seen in now-declassified NATO and U.S. documents, such as the
records from the U.S.-Soviet working group on negotiating the language
that ultimately became Article I of the NPT. But the nonproliferation
benefit of U.S. military power and security policy was not limited to
NATO members alone. Elsewhere [in Western Europe]{.underline} outside
NATO, [[U.S. security assurances]{.mark} helped [lead to the abandonment
of exploratory nuclear weapons programs]{.mark} in multiple additional
countries. [In East Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}, too, at least two
[[governments abandoned their nuclear]{.mark} weapons [programs as a
result of a combination of]{.mark} U.S. pressure and [U.S. military
reassurances.]{.mark}]{.underline} These various proliferation "dogs
that didn't bark" -- if you'll permit me to borrow from the Sherlock
Holmes tale The Hound of the Baskervilles -- are a critical aspect of
our collective nonproliferation history. [The nuclear weapons programs
that didn't happen, or that stopped, as a result of [U.S. power]{.mark}
and diplomatic engagement in [deter]{.mark}ring [aggression and
dissuad]{.mark}ing [weaponization]{.mark} are today thankfully
invisible.]{.underline} However, they are a huge part of the story of
how the global nonproliferation regime managed to prevent the parade of
proliferation problems about which so many U.S. NIEs worried so grimly
in the 1950s and 1960s.

But as we Americans work to cope with this novelty, and to re-learn how
to devise and implement a sober and effective competitive strategy
against aggressive Great Power rivals, we must also not forget the past.
In particular, I would urge you to remember the ways in which our own
[conventional and [nuclear military power]{.mark} has historically
[served not merely our own security interests, but also the]{.mark}
broader [interests of international peace and security by helping
forestall the proliferation]{.mark} of mankind's most dangerous weapons
and [thus]{.mark} greatly [reducing the risk of nuclear
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Critically, this impact is not purely
historical, for such dynamics continue to operate in today's world. As
we contemplate how best to meet our national security needs and keep the
peace, therefore, I urge you to keep these lessons in mind. [The 2018
Nuclear Posture Review]{.underline} was quite clear in this
[regard]{.underline}. [A strong U.S. nuclear posture not only defends
our allies against conventional and nuclear threats, but also helps
allies forgo the need to develop their own nuclear arsenals. We are
resolutely dedicated to ensuring that the [United States' strength in
the world]{.mark} remains unquestioned and that this might continues to
be used both to [protect the lives and interests of the]{.mark} American
[people and]{.mark} to [reduce proliferation dangers
worldwide.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**A State's Security Is The Primary Driver Of Its Decisions About
Nuclear Weapons**

**Brown** **17** (Maj. J. Wellington Brown \-- an USAF intelligence

counterinsurgency. He has served in Iraq and Afghanistan and with
several special operations commands and national intelligence agencies,
"US Security Guarantees And Nuclear Proliferation" --

In addition to [[security variables]{.underline}]{.mark}, the literature
on the causes [of nuclear proliferation highlight normative,
domestic/bureaucratic, and technological factors that [affect a state's
decisions regarding nuclear weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline} While these
factors are important, it is clear from the literature that a state's
security is the primary driver of its decisions about nuclear weapons.
What is unclear is how a state operationalizes its security. At its most
basic, a state's level of security is a balance between the threats
facing the state and its ability to counter those threats. A state's
threat perception includes both the general instability of its region as
well as any acute threats it faces from conflictual dyads. [[A state can
counter security threats by]{.mark} two means: "external balancing"-
[relying on a defensive alliance or]{.mark} "internal balancing"-
[mobilizing and developing its own military
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons, through secure second
strike retaliatory capability, represent the ultimate expression of
internal balancing. The former approach is cheaper, but less certain
while the latter allows greater autonomy, but at the cost of other state
economic goals. This tradeoff is the eternal self-help dilemma of
international security. Most states strike some equilibrium between
internal and external balancing by both fielding organic militaries and
participating in collective security. The most extreme form of internal
balancing is the acquisition of nuclear weapons. [Most US allies exceed
the technological and economic threshold to develop nuclear weapons, but
of the 63 treaty or major non-NATO allies, only four possess nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} What explains this general restraint as well as
the few exceptions? [28 propose that [a US ally's movement toward
nuclear weapons is a function of the threat it faces and the United
States' commitment to it.]{.mark} If the threat outweighs the level of
US commitment, then the ally will be motivated to explore or pursue
nuclear weapons.]{.underline} The relationship would be expressed as:
f(P) = T -- C or Proliferation = Threat -- Commitment. Unfortunately,
such a simple formula does not fully capture the complexity of the
situation. The expression above is based on objective conditions, but
since what is at issue is state motivation what matters is the ally's
perception of those conditions. Thus, a more fulsome hypothesis is that
a [[US ally's movement toward nuclear weapons is]{.mark} a function of
the ally's threat perception [counterbalanced by its perception of US
commitment to its defense]{.mark}.]{.underline} This relationship can be
expressed in what I call the Allied Proliferation Vector model: f(P) =
Tp -- Cp or Proliferation = perceived Threat -- perceived Commitment
where P is a forward proliferation vector along a spectrum of nuclear
weapons activities. Tp and Cp are discrete values between 1 and 3 based
on objective criteria for the ally's threat environment and the United
States' enacted level of commitment. The P subscript represents the
ally's perception of the United States' commitment to its defense. I
hypothesize that [[when an ally perceives]{.mark} its [threat]{.mark}
environment [to be higher than]{.mark} the level of [US commitment then
it is likely to move forward]{.mark} down a pathway [toward nuclear
weapons]{.mark}. This is true whether the state faces a severe
conventional or nuclear threat. When the perceived US commitment level
exceeds the threat level, the ally will cease forward movement toward
nuclear weapons and may, with sufficient counterpressure, even roll back
its program. To illustrate how these threat and commitment influence
proliferation, I will explain each element beginning with the
proliferation pathway.]{.underline}

[[Security guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark} by a nuclear-armed State,
potentially involving the use of nuclear weapons [to protect an ally,
have [play]{.mark}ed [a very important role in preventing
proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}. They exist in various forms, from
unilateral statements to formal alliances backed by permanent military
deployments. In many cases, during the Cold war, security guarantees
were made manifest and tangible by the presence of nuclear weapons. This
was the case in NATO, but also for some time in Japan and Taiwan. The
North Atlantic Organization Treaty (NATO) has played the role of a
non-proliferation instrument. Article 5 of the Washington Treaty (1949)
creates an obligation to assist any member State victim of an armed
attack. This article has been widely interpreted as implying the
possible use of nuclear weapons by the United States, the United Kingdom
and France in defense of their allies. NATO's non-proliferation role is
not limited to Article 5. Over years, the organization has developed a
web of collective defense cooperation and consultation mechanisms,
resulting in the existence of what could be called a "security blanket"
making member States feel secure. Most importantly, it has developed a
unique collective system of nuclear planning. Starting in the mid-1960s,
through the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), NATO developed a common
mechanism of consultations, planning and employment doctrine, which has
given all members a nuclear culture and a say in the process of possible
weapons use -- including through a widespread presence of US nuclear
weapons in Europe, and the availability of large number of these weapons
in wartime to allied forces. The creation of the NPG was largely a quid
pro quo for the abandonment of the Multi-Lateral Force, an ambitious
scheme which would have given, at least in some early versions of the
proposals, non -nuclear countries such as Germany a finger on the
button. Soviet opposition to the MLF played a significant part in the
debate of the mid-1960s leading to the signing of the Nuclear
NonProliferation Treaty (NPT)2. The shadow of US nuclear weapons
extended even beyond NATO's borders. One of the reasons Sweden ended up
renouncing to build nuclear weapons was that it believed that there was
a de facto nuclear umbrella covering its territory, because of its
geographical situation (see below). In the Asia-Pacific region too,
[[continued US protection of several key allies]{.mark} has almost
[certainly prevented them from going nuclear.]{.mark} Japan is protected
by the Security Treaty between the United States and Japan (1951). South
Korea is covered by the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States
and the Republic of Korea (1953)3. Taiwan, though not benefitting from
the same security guarantee that it enjoyed until the recognition of
Beijing, was and is still indirectly protected by the Taiwan Relations
Act (1979)4. Australia, for its part, is covered by the ANZUS treaty
(1951). Some US reports have referred to "about 30 countries" being
covered by the American nuclear umbrella. This number suggests adding
Japan, South Korea and Australia to the 27 nonUS NATO members, and
perhaps Taiwan and/or Israel. The importance of positive security
assurances in preventing proliferation can be demonstrated a contrario.
[The lack of a strong security guarantee, or doubts about the scope and
value of an existing one, have been key drivers of nuclear proliferation
since 1945.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Last week, James Mattis made his first international trip as U.S.
defense secretary. Over four days [[in **Japan** and **So**]{.mark}uth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}, [[Mattis sought to **reassure**
officials]{.mark} in both countries [of]{.mark} **[Washington's
commitments]{.mark}** to them]{.underline}. [[**Many in East Asia** are
**worried** about the **direction** of **U.S. foreign policy**]{.mark}

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, [who]{.underline} during his campaign
[[chastised Japan and **So**]{.mark}uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea [for not

Like Trump's November meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
and Trump's phone calls with South Korean officials, [[Mattis' visit
suggested]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} new [admin]{.mark}istration [is

timing of Mattis' visit was critical]{.underline}, coming as it did amid
growing criticism from regional observers that the Trump administration
was set to cast aside the United States' pivot to Asia and focus more on
threats from the Middle East. But perhaps more important was Mattis'
tone: [[The]{.mark} defense [secretary **did not press allies** on
**burden-sharing**]{.mark}]{.underline} but sought instead to reassure
and listen to them. **[[That was the right move]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Washington and Florida. Like Mattis, Trump should use those meetings to
reassure Abe of Washington's commitment to its alliance with Japan.

Is Trying to Dismantle the World Order. Is NATO Next on His List? June

**[A]{.mark}**tlantic **[T]{.mark}**reaty **[O]{.mark}**rganization
**[are]{.mark}** not **[referred to]{.mark}** in its statutes as members
or signatories but [as **allies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the military
grouping nervously prepares for a July 11/12 summit, 28 of those
nations' leaders may be forgiven for wondering whether that word still
describes the country led by the 29th.

In the space of two weeks in June, U.S. President Donald Trump first
baited his supposed friends into a trade war by slapping tariffs on
steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and other nations. He
argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin -- still under E.U. and
U.S. sanctions for the annexation of Crimea -- should be invited back
into the G7, before rejecting the summit's communique and personally
insulting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. All that before he met
North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and called him a "very talented"
leader.

This dismantling of long-established norms of global diplomacy has many
wondering whether **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the alliance that
[[has **preserved global stability** since the]{.mark} darkest days of
the [Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}, [is [the]{.mark}]{.underline} next
**[[foundation]{.underline}]{.mark}** block [[of the]{.mark} current
**[world order]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the President plans to
uproot.

"All of that left the friends and allies of the United States wondering,
who is the leader of the democratic world?" Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the
previous secretary general of NATO, tells TIME. "And if that is repeated
in Brussels in July it would be no less than a disaster, not only for
the Western democratic world but for the democratic world globally."

There are many targets of Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}'s ire, but
[[NATO has]{.mark} long [played a **key role** in his **narrative** of
the **U.S. footing the bill** for the **rest of the world** at the
**expense** of **its own citizens**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[He
has]{.underline}]{.mark} repeatedly [[railed against the U.S. putting
up]{.mark} a [disproportionate]{.mark} amount of **[funding]{.mark}**
for NATO]{.underline}.

[[The U.S. accounts for 22%]{.mark} of the [NATO]{.mark} alliance's
[common funding]{.mark}, which is [spent on]{.mark} projects like
[**military readiness**, **joint exercises**, and]{.mark} initiatives
[to counter cyber-war]{.mark}fare]{.underline}, and is responsible for
70% of total defense spending among alliance members. Under pressure
from Washington --- and reacting to Russian aggression --- NATO members
agreed in 2014 to each increase defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2024.
But progress has been slow; so far only eight NATO countries meet that
target.

While many Europeans, including Rasmussen, agree with Trump's general
point about defense spending, [his method of expressing it is
**exasperating allies**]{.underline}. On June 10, a day after the G7
summit, Trump launched a Twitter tirade clearly aimed at Europe,
lamenting that the U.S. spends money "protecting many of these same
countries that rip us off on trade", and warning that "change is
coming".

On trade and the G7, European leaders are feeling empowered to punch
back at the U.S. French President Emmanuel Macron said recently that the
G7 could do without Trump, while on trade the E.U. this week retaliated
with their own tariffs on US goods. "The initial idea of playing nice
with Donald Trump, which several European leaders have tried, has been
demonstrably proven to yield no benefits," says Anthony Gardner, who
acted as U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. from 2014 to 2017.

But there is far more at stake when it comes to NATO, especially on the
front line of the new antagonistic relationship with Russia. Since Putin
annexed Crimea in 2014, nations along NATO's eastern flank have been
increasingly concerned by Russian aggression along their own borders,
and still see the U.S. as the most important backer of their security.

"Without the United States, European security would be in great danger,"
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics tells TIME. "We can't simply
build something that would exclude the United States -- this is simply
impossible: look at the resources, look at capabilities." While he
predicts "long, very difficult, very heated meetings" at the July
summit, Rinkevics believes a consensus is still within reach.

[**[Trump's]{.mark}** abrupt [**cancelling** of **joint**]{.mark}
**military [exercises]{.mark}** [on the **Korean peninsula**]{.mark}
after his meeting with Kim has [also **raised questions** about
whether]{.mark} war games in [**Europe** **could suffer a similar
fate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Just this month, the U.S. led joint
exercises in the Baltics and in Poland with 18 other
nations]{.underline}. Rinkevics, whose country helped host these
exercises, is confident the war games will continue. "I don't believe
that there is going to be such kind of development," he says, even if
Trump does make good on suggestions of a U.S.-Russia summit.

Yet the tensions between the U.S. and Germany may again come to the
fore. Not only does Germany spend comparatively less on defense than
other major powers, but Trump has recently taken Chancellor Angela
Merkel to task over her refugee policy that is currently the subject of
a bitter domestic political feud.

"He is picking on Germany more than anyone else for a simple reason: he
wants Merkel to fail and he wants the migration issue to demonstrate the
failure of her policies," says Gardner. "It is a remarkable situation of
the President of the United States attacking one of our closest and
dearest allies, basically for domestic purposes."

The embattled Merkel will be keen to avoid a further spat with Trump,
says Christian Mölling, deputy director of the German Council on Foreign
Relations. With that in mind, German defense officials travelled to
Washington for meetings ahead of the summit to try and sell to their
U.S. counterparts a plan to increase defense spending to 1.5% by 2024.
"She will definitely want to prevent a public fight with Trump, if that
is possible, because he holds the cards given the fact that he can
always choose to come up with the 2% discussion and Merkel would be on
the defensive side," says Mölling.

Rasmussen urged NATO members to keep discussions about defense spending
behind closed doors, cautioning that [a [public disagreement may raise
public **doubt** over America's commitment to **Article 5**]{.mark}, the
clause which says that all NATO members will respond if one of their
number is threatened]{.underline}. "[[**Putin** might **take it as a
signal**]{.mark} that when push comes to shove, the [Americans will not
be ready to]{.mark} really [defend]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, so it sends a very dangerous signal to
autocrats," he says.

As growing aggression from Russia and China becomes "the main

[if]{.mark} it does [not]{.mark} assume the burden of [countering

between Washington and its allies on issues such as trade and the Iran

agree that "the great challenge of the 21st century will be the
competition between the free world and authoritarian corrupt state-led
capitalism, chief among them China and Russia," according to Wilson.
This view, enshrined in [the Trump administration's latest National
Defense Strategy and largely accepted by both political parties,
necessitates that the United States leverage its network of alliances
"as a strategic comparative advantage over our
adversaries.]{.underline}" For Russia specifically, "there is no
possible successful strategy to confront \[Russian President Vladimir\]
Putin's aggression without a strong NATO," Wilson said. At a time in
which much attention has been paid to whether or not NATO allies are
adequately paying the costs for the Alliance's defense, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must avoid]{.mark} openly
[questioning]{.mark} the value of [the Alliance]{.mark}, he argued. "The
public questioning of our commitment to the Alliance is dangerous and
only weakens our position]{.underline}." Asked by Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI)
about the growing military threat from Russia, Wilson explained that the
biggest contribution to continued Russian military aggression has been
Moscow's "calculation about what they can get away with." In order to
adequately deter Russia from taking further steps against its neighbors,
including NATO allies in Europe, the United States must have "absolute
clarity that there is firm resolve about Article V" commitments to
common defense. Wilson also noted that [[the Alliance has
achieved]{.mark} significant [progress]{.mark} in the last
year]{.underline} "[[bolstering the]{.mark} Alliance's [rapid reaction
capabilities]{.mark} and hybrid warfare defense and promising to extend
the Alliance's reach into the southern Balkans through further
enlargement]{.underline}." He explained that [[allies have]{.mark} heard
US complaints about burden sharing, [spend]{.mark}ing [an additional
\$41 billion]{.mark} on defense since 2016 and promising to spend \$100
billion more by 2020 and \$350 billion additionally by
2024]{.underline}. This week, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
gave credit to US President Donald J. Trump for allies increasing their
defense spending. "We agreed to do more to step up---and now we see the
results. By the end of next year, NATO allies will add \$100 billion
extra toward defense," Stoltenberg said in an interview on Fox News
Sunday. "So we see some real money and some real results. And we see
that the clear message from President Donald Trump is having an impact."
Trump acknowledged Stoltenberg's comments in a tweet, declaring: "Jens
Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, just stated that because of me NATO
has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members
after many years of decline. It's called burden sharing. Also, more
united." But [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [needs to remember
that "NATO is for our interest]{.mark}," Wilson argued, noting that the
only time NATO's mutual defense clause was activated was in the
aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. On the threat posed by China,
[Wilson said this must]{.mark} also [be met with a united front with US
allies]{.mark}, not just in Asia]{.underline}, but also in Europe where
"China is becoming a greater geopolitical reality as it comes closer via
cyberspace, trade and investment, and now military presence close to
Europe's shores. The United States should confront any Chinese challenge
with Europe as well as our Asian allies by our side." [Wilson conceded
that while the [disagreements]{.mark} between the United States and its
allies, such as trade disputes and differences on policy toward Iran,
"are real," the need to confront Russia and China "[should]{.mark}
inevitably [drive Washington to bolster and expand]{.mark} its
[alliances]{.mark} in the coming years]{.underline}." The United States,
Wilson argued, should avoid "unnecessary division \[that\] plays into
the hands of Washington's geopolitical competitors." Rather than putting
economic or other diplomatic issues before the strength of its network
of friends, the United States, Wilson maintained, should "put our
alliances at the core, not the periphery, of our strategy."

Trump's diatribes are not the only cause of the unease. A broadening

claims that the United States is overdue for a major strategic

Even [staunch [defenders of NATO express doubts]{.mark} about its
future.
[Some](http://www.gmfus.org/publications/global-shift-how-west-should-respond-rise-china)
worry that the growing U.S. preoccupation with East Asia will lure the
United States away from its Atlantic calling and generate transatlantic
tensions over how to deal with the rise of China]{.underline}.
[Others](http://www.belfercenter.org/publication/new-report-focuses-nato-seventy-alliance-crisis)
fear that [democratic backsliding among
members](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-06-14/natos-enemies-within)
is compromising the alliance's values-based solidarity. [Close NATO
watchers](http://nato.usmission.gov/february-13-2018-press-briefing-ambassador-kay-bailey-hutchison/)
are concerned that EU efforts to more deeply integrate European foreign
and defense policy could ultimately
[weaken](http://twitter.com/NileGardiner/status/964506710890205184) the
Atlantic link. And [[debate rages]{.mark} on both sides of the Atlantic
[as to whether NATO enlargement has enhanced or eroded]{.mark} European
[stability]{.mark} and whether to continue expansion despite the costs
to the West's relationship with Russia. **These worries are
unwarranted**: [NATO]{.mark} at 70 [is]{.mark} actually [in]{.mark}
remarkably [good shape]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes, European allies have
been laggards on defense spending, and some members---Hungary, Poland,
and Turkey in particular---have tarnished democratic credentials. [But
[NATO has]{.mark} demonstrated [an]{.mark} impressive [ability to adapt
to]{.mark} the [changing geopolitical]{.mark} [environment]{.mark} since
the Cold War's end, ensuring that the United States and Europe remain
each other's go-to partners. [The alliance]{.mark} [opened its doors
to]{.mark} the [new democracies]{.mark} that emerged from the former
Soviet bloc, [helping to anchor]{.mark} security and [democracy]{.mark}
in a wider Europe. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, [members
have taken important steps to strengthen deterrence]{.mark} against the
Kremlin's adventurism]{.underline}. NATO has struck partnerships across
the globe and carried out ambitious missions well beyond the territory
of member states---most notably in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya.
All the while, [[the alliance has retooled to address new
hazards]{.mark} such as cyberthreats, terrorism, hybrid warfare, and
migration. Precisely [because NATO has been so nimble]{.mark} and
effective[, it enjoys strong political support]{.mark} on both sides of
the Atlantic, leaving Trump virtually alone as a vociferous critic.
Moreover---and paradoxically---[Trump's withering attacks on the
alliance]{.mark} are actually [strengthen]{.mark}ing
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Defenders of the alliance are coming out of
the woodwork, especially in the U.S. Congress. [Trump's regular
haranguing of allies for insufficient defense spending is paying off:
Europeans are finally investing more in their militaries]{.mark}, making
it only more likely that the United States will cleave to Europe as its
partner of choice. And Trump's skepticism toward NATO expansion could
help resolve continuing controversy over enlargement, guiding allies to
the sensible conclusion that it is time for the alliance to begin
closing its open door.]{.underline}

[ambiguous]{.underline} commitments are enough to cause [nuke

[Trump's comments are]{.underline} worse than just [undermining NATO: By
[refusing to commit]{.mark} to the Baltics
**[categorically]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[he encourages Russia to
test]{.mark} American [resolve]{.mark} in dangerous ways]{.underline}.
[According to]{.underline} some [Russia experts]{.underline}, Vladimir
[[Putin's]{.mark} ultimate [wish]{.mark} in Europe [is to break
NATO]{.mark}. [The way]{.mark} to do that, according to these scholars,
is to [expose]{.mark} the [Article 5]{.mark} guarantee [as
hollow]{.mark}: to show that when push comes to shove, the United
States]{.underline} or other large NATO powers [wouldn't actually defend
the weaker states]{.underline}. [The Baltic states would be the most
likely scenario for this to happen]{.underline}. They are very small,
they're right on Russia's borders, and they aren\'t really all that
important to Western countries\' own security. By threatening these
states, Russia would force a question: Are the United States, Britain,
and France really willing to sacrifice their own soldiers in defense of
a tiny state? In 2014, the Danish intelligence agency --- note that
Denmark is a NATO ally --- publicly warned that this was a serious
possibility: [[Russia may]{.mark} attempt to [test NATO]{.mark}'s
cohesion]{.underline} by engaging in military intimidation of the Baltic
countries, for instance [[with a **threatening**]{.mark} **military
[build-up]{.mark}** close to the borders of these countries [and]{.mark}
simultaneous attempts of **[political pressure]{.mark}**,
[destabilization]{.mark} [and]{.mark} possibly
**[infiltration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Russia could launch such an
intimidation campaign]{.underline} in connection with a serious crisis
in the post-Soviet space or another international crisis in which Russia
confronts the United States and NATO. [[The critical issue]{.mark} in
preventing this scenario, again, [is]{.mark} the **[perception of NATO
commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[So long as Putin believes]{.mark}
that the US and other major [powers are firmly committed]{.mark} to the
defense of their treaty allies, [he's **unlikely to risk**]{.mark}
**starting a [war]{.mark}** that he would almost certainly
lose]{.underline}. [This is why [Trump's comments]{.mark} are so
damaging: They [send a direct signal]{.mark} to the Kremlin
[that]{.mark} a Trump-led [America will be less]{.mark} than
[serious]{.mark} about the defense of NATO allies. This suggests that a
ploy to break NATO might have a bigger risk]{.underline} of succeeding
than previously thought. But note that [Trump]{.underline} also [refused
to say unequivocally that he wouldn't abide by the NATO
treaty]{.underline}. "I don't want to tell you what I'd do because I
don't want Putin to know what I'd do," he said. [But the entire point of
NATO is that [Putin **needs to know what America will
do**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} he knows [the US will
defend]{.mark} the Baltics, then [he will]{.mark} likely **[back
off]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [If he knows the US won't defend the
Baltics, then we could have the breakup of NATO]{.underline} --- which
would be quite bad but wouldn't immediately risk World War III. [[The
nightmare]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}, though, [[is that Putin's
**confidence**]{.mark} **in NATO** [is undermined even though the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates under Trump [remains
committed]{.mark} to defending its treaty allies]{.underline}. [That's
the scenario under which [misperceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}
potentially **[[escalate into]{.mark} an [actual war]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} the world's two largest [nuclear
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Max Fisher wrote an extended piece on how
this uncertainty could plausibly escalate to war for Vox last year; I
encourage you to read it. But the point, according the experts Fisher
spoke to, is that **[a firm understanding that the US will defend its
NATO allies is crucial]{.underline}**. \"That kind of
**[[misperception]{.underline}]{.mark}** situation
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** definitely possible, and that's **[[how
wars start]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Steve Saideman, a professor who
studies NATO at Carleton University, told Fisher. He then scarily
compared modern Europe with pre--World War I Europe: \"**[The thing that

The conservative case for NATO is not that it strengthens liberal world

[bolsters American national interests. [In an **age of great-power
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as identified by the Trump
administration, [[America's]{.mark} Western [alliance provides]{.mark}
the U.S. with some dramatic **[comparative

European [[allies have]{.mark} a number of **[common
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} and common challenges **[[with]{.mark}
regard to [Beijing, Moscow, terrorism, cyberattacks]{.mark}, migration,
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s, and]{.mark} military [readiness. NATO is the
one]{.mark} formal [alliance that allows]{.mark} for [cooperation on
these matters.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It is also the only alliance that
embodies America's civilizational ties with Europe --- a point
forcefully made by President Trump when he visited Poland in 2017.
Properly understood, [[NATO]{.mark} helps [keeps]{.mark} America's
strategic [competitors at bay]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[pushing back on
Russian and Chinese influence]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In all of these
ways, [[the]{.mark} U.S. alliance [system]{.mark} in Europe [is]{.mark}
a bit like **[oxygen]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[You may take it for
granted, but [you'll miss it when it's gone.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Now consider the alternative. [**American [withdrawal]{.mark}** from
NATO [would]{.mark} be a grave error]{.underline}. Not only would [it
[surrender]{.mark} the above [advantages and **undo**]{.mark} **existing

[is]{.mark} an [unreliable]{.mark} friend.]{.underline} America's

[Trump's comments about NATO are like an **arrow** pointed straight at
the **heart of the alliance** \-- and]{.underline}, if implemented,
[would directly threaten the foundations of global peace
itself]{.underline}. Any president could simply choose not to abide by
Article 5. But [[abrogating NATO]{.mark} agreements [was always deemed
**unthinkable**]{.mark} by both parties, which has played an important
part in maintaining credible deterrence vis-à-vis Russia]{.underline}.
[[Trump]{.mark} has [put the idea of]{.mark} the US **[not defending
NATO on the table]{.mark}**, in a very real way]{.underline}. **[This
threatens]{.underline}** the very integrity **[of NATO
itself]{.underline}**. [[If]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} allies start to
[think]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} United [States can't be trusted]{.mark}
to defend them, that NATO is just on paper, then they'll start to wonder
why they bother to adhere to this alliance]{.underline} in the first
place. If Trump wins the election, [this could cause them to exit the
security agreement altogether]{.underline}. According to the best
available research, **[[this would make war on the European

[deter aggression against its non-nuclear partners (like Germany and the

Dartmouth scholars Steven [[Brooks and]{.underline}]{.mark} William
[[Wohlforth]{.underline}]{.mark} also surveyed research from regional
experts and [[found a similar consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Europe,
they write, [\"most assessments]{.underline} nonetheless [sum up to the

then, could end up weakening one of America's most important security
agreements]{.underline} --- and may already have done so.

If the risk of territorial aggression increases, [the [possession of
**nuclear weapons** would become]{.mark} an **[attractive]{.mark}**
option for some states whose security was previously guaranteed by the
United States. Nuclear weapons are most useful for deterring major
territorial aggression, meaning their potential utility increases as the
potential for war does]{.underline}.93 A number of U.S.
[allies]{.underline} have either previously pursued nuclear weapons or
have the capability to do so. They [might choose to obtain a nuclear
arsenal once responsible for their own security]{.underline}.

There are at least two reasons why [[increasing]{.mark} the [number of
nuclear]{.mark} weapons [states]{.mark} [may not have the **pacifying
effect**]{.mark} some realists suggest they do.]{.underline} First,
[[states do not]{.mark} always [adopt]{.mark} the
**[second-strike]{.mark}---**]{.underline}that is,
retaliatory---[**postures** realists assume they will]{.underline}.
Recent research shows that [even in the paradigmatic case of mutual
assured destruction]{.underline}---the Cold War superpower
standoff---[neither the United States nor the Soviet Union abandoned the
search for a **first-strike capability**]{.underline}.94 Moreover,
political scientist Vipin Narang's research on India-Pakistan nuclear
relations has demonstrated that states sometimes adopt risky postures in
pursuit of goals other than deterrence.95

[Second, an increased number of nuclear weapon states will **increase**
the **chances nuclear weapons will be used** [even if states do]{.mark}
adopt **second-strike postures**]{.underline}. On the one hand, simple
[organizational pathologies or political [instability]{.mark} in a new
nuclear state could [lead to]{.mark} an **[accidental]{.mark}** or
**unauthorized nuclear [launch]{.mark}**]{.underline}.96 On the other
hand, [even for retaliatory postures, effective [**deterrence**
requires]{.mark} that states [credibly **signal**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[that they are willing to use nuclear weapons in retaliation for an
attack]{.underline}. [To do so requires that nuclear [states]{.mark} in
competition with one another must [maintain a **willingness to risk
nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The [greater]{.mark} the
[number of]{.mark} these "**[competition\[s\] in risk
taking]{.mark},**]{.underline}" as Thomas Schelling called them, [the
**[more likely]{.mark}** it is that **[nuclear weapons will be
used]{.mark}** at some point.97]{.underline}

The situation in [Northeast Asia helps illustrate how increasing the
number of nuclear weapons states **increases** the **probability that
nuclear weapons will be used**]{.underline}. [**[Absent U.S. security
guarantees]{.mark}**, [there is a real possibility]{.mark} that
[**Japan**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[Taiwan]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}** [[would build nuclear

Korea]{.underline}**]{.mark}.98 There are currently two nuclear dyads in
the region: the United States and China, and the United States and North
Korea. [If Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea all acquired nuclear weapons,
[there would be]{.mark} at least **[five additional
dyads]{.mark}**]{.underline}: China and Taiwan, China and Japan, China
and South Korea, North Korea and South Korea, and North Korea and Japan.
[Given **lingering tensions**]{.underline} from its pre-1945 occupation
of the Korean Peninsula, [a South Korea-Japanese nuclear dyad is
entirely plausible as well]{.underline}.99 [[Each new
dyad]{.underline}]{.mark} adds a contest in risk-taking, which
[**[increases the chances]{.mark}** that **[nuclear weapons will be

also importantly suggests that nuclear allies present dramatically
different risks for the United States and the world than do non-nuclear
allies. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates often [extends security to

that]{.mark} this [protection can curb conflict]{.mark}, reduce tension,
and mitigate the need for an ally to develop their own nuclear weapons.

But if those security institutions and military deployments disappeared,
U.S. allies --- including Japan and South Korea --- might well pursue
nuclear weapons of their own. Recent research shows that alliances are a
powerful tool for preventing proliferation, both because they [reassure
states that their security will be protected in case of

Donald Trump every so often suggests he'd like to pull the United States
out of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, knowing full well
that would be the end of NATO as we've known it for almost 70 years. And
such hints, the most recent of them last week at a summit in Brussels,
must make Vladimir Putin's crocodile smile spread from ear to ear.
Indeed, going into the Helsinki summit with Trump on Monday, Putin is
surely aware that it was not necessary for Trump to pull the U.S. out of
NATO in a formal sense for him to harm the alliance --- and benefit
Russia. Official statements notwithstanding, merely threatening to walk
away from the Atlantic Alliance has been deeply destabilizing, and no
amount of frantic damage control by Trump underlings is likely to fix
that. "In casting doubt on America\'s commitment to defend NATO
countries against attack, Trump is forcing these countries to begin
preparing to go it alone or realign themselves under a new
European-based alliance to provide collective defense without U.S.
support," Bruce Blair, a Princeton University nuclear expert, tells The
Daily Beast. If Trump actually did withdraw, Europe would become right
away much more vulnerable to Russian nuclear attack or, more likely,
intimidation. But immediate nuclear fire isn\'t the only danger. More
realistically, the Americans leaving NATO would force European countries
that currently lack nuclear arms to toss aside the 1968
Non-Proliferation Treaty and rush to acquire them, all in order to deter
the Russians without the Americans\' help. The treaty\'s disintegration
could then lead to countries all over the world pursuing their own
nukes. \"Trump is increasing the chances of the bomb spreading and the
key treaty keeping the lid on such proliferation collapsing,\" says
Blair. [[Unconstrained nuclearization is one nightmare scenario]{.mark}
that is becoming increasingly plausible as Trump escalates his criticism
of the 69-year-old North Atlantic alliance. For three quarters of a
century, [American nukes have made it unnecessary for]{.mark} many
[Europe]{.mark}an countries [to possess nukes of their
own.]{.mark}]{.underline} Because of that, these countries could safely
sign on to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, bolstering international
efforts to limit nuclearization all over the world. \"Among the benefits
of NATO, a key one is that it has helped to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons,\" Kingston Reif, an analyst with the Arms Control
Association, told The Daily Beast. But that was long before Trump's rise
as a political force. In 2017, the former reality-T.V. star declared
NATO \"obsolete.\" In Brussels on July 11, Trump again questioned the
organization\'s usefulness. \"What good is NATO?\" he asked. The next
day at a meeting of NATO leaders, Trump threatened that he might \"do
his own thing\" if alliance members didn\'t immediately increase their
military spending. Trump\'s words sent a chill through European
capitals. The United States is by far the biggest military spender in
NATO and, according to Mark Simakovsky, a fellow with the Atlantic
Council\'s Eurasia Center, the \"glue\" that holds the alliance
together. \"Don\'t forget, there are huge divisions in Europe,\"
Simakovsky said. NATO\'s 29 member states range from illiberal Turkey,
Hungary and Poland on the alliance\'s eastern flank to stalwarts France
and Germany at the heart of the continent and the restive United Kingdom
in the west. At present just two non-U.S. NATO states -- the U.K. and
France -- possess nuclear weapons. France fields around 300 nukes. The
U.K, around 215. By contrast, the United States maintains an arsenal of
no fewer than 3,800 atomic warheads, only slightly fewer than Russia
possesses. The U.S. military keeps 180 warheads in Europe for use by its
own forces and the forces of certain NATO members, most notably Germany.
Under Article V of the NATO charter, an attack on any NATO state
represents an attack on every other state -- and the alliance is
obligated to respond. That applies to a nuclear strike as well as
conventional attack[.]{.underline} If Russia nuked, say, Lithuania or
Poland, the United States would be obligated to nuke Russia right back.
That mutual nuclear threat has helped to keep the peace in Europe since
the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb in a test in 1949, the
same year as NATO\'s founding. But with France and the U.K. possessing
so few atomic warheads compared to Russia, deterrence in Europe could
begin to collapse without American nukes. And that risk could drive
European countries to create their own, more powerful deterrents --
either collectively or individually. \"The loss of U.S. reliability to
deter aggression against NATO Europe would prompt France and the U.K. to
expand their nuclear capabilities and Germany and other non-nuclear
countries to consider building their own nuclear arsenals despite strong
public opposition,\" Blair said. Some European officials are already
thinking in those terms. In 2017, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party, called for Europe to build up a
combined nuclear arsenal as powerful as Russia\'s own arsenal.
Conservative German parliamentarian Roderich Kiesewetter endorsed the
idea. If the United States were to leave NATO, Europe could build its
own deterrent under the umbrella of a diminished NATO structure, or opt
for a new structure based on the European Union. In the last decade or
so, the E.U. has begun to establish a rudimentary military organization,
but has deployed troops only rarely -- and then mostly in Africa on
peacekeeping duties. The realignment could get complicated. Albania,
Canada, Iceland, Norway and Turkey are in NATO, but aren\'t in the E.U.
Austria, Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden are in the E.U., but aren\'t
in NATO. Ireland, for one, is strictly opposed to nuclear weapons.
\"There are European Union members with nuclear capabilities, but how
those capabilities would be employed outside of a NATO context -- it\'s
never been fleshed out,\" Simakovsky said. [[For Trump to]{.mark} even
threaten to [pull back America\'s atomic umbrella]{.mark} is
dangerous,]{.underline} Simakovsky said. [\"What it [encourages]{.mark}
is [instability.]{.mark}\" And that instability -- and t[he resulting
mistrust]{.mark} between former allies -- [plays into the hands
of]{.mark} Russian president Vladimir [Putin.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It
could]{.mark} even,]{.underline} in the most extreme scenario, [[tempt
Putin to launch his own]{.mark} limited [nuclear strike in the context
of a wider war in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[In the last
decade Russia has invaded two of its]{.mark} European [neighbors --
Ukraine]{.mark} in 2014 [and the Republic of Georgia]{.mark} in
2008]{.underline}. Neither Georgia nor Ukraine is a full member of NATO,
although both countries have signalled their desire to join the
alliance. The Eastern European states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
-- all former Soviet republics -- and Poland, formerly a Soviet
satellite, are NATO members and view themselves as the main targets of
Russia\'s aggression. This year, Russia deployed nuclear weapons to
Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea between Poland and
Lithuania. The Trump administration criticized the Russian deployment as
\"destabilizing.\" But the greater threat of destabilization comes from
the administration itself as it continues to dismantle rhetorically a
security structure that has preserved the peace -- and deterred nuclear
war -- in Europe since 1949. \"If Putin somehow decides to cross the
nuclear threshold, it won't be because he thinks we don't have enough
nuclear weapons,\" Reif said. \"It will be based on a political
calculation that he has a greater stake in the conflict and we and our
allies won't be willing to run the risk of escalation.\" The alternative
is only less awful. [That, in the absence of America\'s nuclear
guarantee as part of a transatlantic alliance, Europe might build up a
large nuclear arsenal of its own and supercharge global atomic
proliferation.]{.underline} \"Nothing would do more to cause nuclear
anarchy than wrecking NATO,\" Blair said.

Old\" \|\| <https://issues.org/panofsky/>

During the past decade, the United States and Russia have joined in a
number of efforts to reduce the danger posed by the enormous quantity of
weapons-usable material withdrawn from nuclear weapons. Other countries
and various private groups have assisted in this task. But many
impediments have prevented effective results, and most of the dangers
still remain. Even more troubling, this threat is only one of several
risks imposed on humanity by the existence of nuclear weapons. These
risks fall into three classes[: [the risk that]{.mark} some fraction, be
it large or small, of the inventories of [nuclear weapons]{.mark} held
by eight countries [will be detonated]{.mark} either [by accident or
deliberately; the risk that nuclear]{.mark} weapons [tech]{.mark}nology
[will diffuse to additional nations; and the risk that nucl]{.mark}ear
weapon[s will reach]{.mark} the hands of [terrorist]{.mark} individuals
or [groups]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The United States has
undertaken diverse programs to reduce these risks. But efforts have been
slow and irregular, and the priorities in addressing these problems have
been distorted by politics. Indeed, success in containing these risks
would fly in the face of historical precedent. All new technologies have
become dual-use, in that they have been used both to improve the human
condition and as tools in military conflict. Moreover, all new
technologies have, in time, spread around the globe. But this precedent
must be broken with respect to the release of nuclear technology. Risk
is the product of the likelihood of an adverse event multiplied by the
consequences of that event. Since the end of the Cold War, the
likelihood that one or another country would deliberately use nuclear
weapons has indeed lessened, although the consequences of such use would
be enormous. Therefore, this risk has by no means disappeared. In
particular, nuclear weapons might be used in a regional conflict, such
as between India and Pakistan. The risk of proliferation of nuclear
weapons among countries has been limited in the past by the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), signed in 1968. The treaty recognizes
five countries as "Nuclear Weapons States," and three other countries
not party to the treaty are de facto possessors of nuclear weapons. All
other nations of the world have joined the treaty as "Non-Nuclear
Weapons States," but one country (North Korea) has withdrawn. Some
countries--presumed to include Iran and, until the ouster of Saddam
Hussein, Iraq--maintain ambitions to gain nuclear weapons. A much larger
number of countries have pursued nuclear weapons programs in the past
but have been persuaded to abandon them. The NPT is a complex bargain
that discriminates between have and have-not countries. The have-not
nations have agreed not to receive nuclear weapons, their components, or
relevant information, whereas the Nuclear Weapons States have agreed not
to furnish these items. In order to decrease the discriminatory nature
of the agreement, the nations possessing nuclear weapons are obligated
to assist other nations in the peaceful applications of nuclear energy.
And, most important of all, the Nuclear Weapons States have agreed to
reduce the role of nuclear weapons in international relations and to
work in good faith toward their elimination. It is in respect to this
latter obligation that the United States has been most deficient. In
fact, the current Bush administration's recent Nuclear Posture Review
projects an indefinite need for many thousands of nuclear weapons, and
even searches for new missions for them. The risk posed by the possible
acquisition of nuclear weapons by terrorists is growing rapidly.
Deterrence prevented direct military conflict between the United States
and the former Soviet Union for many years, and deterrence retains its
leverage even over the so-called "states of concern," such as North
Korea. But deterrence will not restrain terrorists driven by fanatical
beliefs. Therefore, the prevention of nuclear catastrophe caused by
terrorists has to rely either on interdicting the explosive materials
that are essential to making nuclear weapons (highly enriched uranium
and plutonium, in particular) or on preventing the hostile delivery of
such weapons. [[Once a terrorist group acquires nuclear weapons,
preventing their detonation]{.mark} on U.S. soil [would be extremely
difficult. Such weapons might be delivered by aircraft or]{.mark} cruise
[missile, or]{.mark} they might be [detonated on board ships near U.S.
harbors.]{.mark}]{.underline} [As demonstrated by the leakage of illegal
drugs into the United States, [closing U.S. boundaries to the entry of
nuclear weapons is]{.mark} essentially [impossible.
]{.mark}]{.underline}[A]{.mark}gainst this multitude of delivery
methods, the enormous effort that the United States spends on ballistic
missile defense is an inexcusable distortion of priorities. Indeed, it
is extremely unlikely that terrorists would ever gain access to
ballistic missiles. The first line of defense against nuclear terrorism
must be safeguarding the vast worldwide stockpiles of nuclear
weapons-usable materials. Those inventories are sufficient to produce
more than 100,000 nuclear weapons. [According to public sources, [small
shipments containing]{.mark} a total of roughly 40 kilograms of
s[muggled nuclear explosive material have been seized worldwide]{.mark}
between 1992 and 2002, [generally originating in
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Although public agencies and
private groups in the United States have been working with Russia to
improve "materials protection control and accounting" of its dangerous
materials, actual achievements have been moderate. Several thousand
Russian participants have received training in control and accounting
techniques, and the nation has developed a number of federal regulations
covering such activities. Still, controls over only about one-sixth of
Russian nuclear explosive materials have been upgraded to standards
comparable to those in the United States. And work to interdict nuclear
smuggling at key Russian border crossings is only about 15 percent
complete. A deadly combination of U.S. and Russian travel and access
restrictions is preventing truly effective collaboration and causing
major delays. Russian security services continue to be preoccupied with
preserving the secrecy of the nation's nuclear weapons facilities,
whereas the U.S. Department of Energy has been insisting on direct
access by its personnel in order to ensure that U.S. funds are being
properly spent in reducing risks. There also is the matter of whether
Russia can achieve sustainability for its program to safeguard nuclear
materials. Foreign assistance is necessary to initiate action, but
sustainability has to be the responsibility of the Russians themselves.
[[The risks posed by nuclear weapons are]{.mark} perhaps [the most
threatening results of]{.mark} the interaction of science and technology
with [human endeavors.]{.mark}]{.underline} Can humanity successfully
prevent these new technological developments from concentrating enormous
destructive power in the hands of an ever-smaller number of individuals?
The answer to this question remains open. The United States has the most
to lose if nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, but thus
far the nation has failed to take constructive leadership in attacking
that risk.

Nuclear-Arms Race" \|\|
<https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-growing-dangers-of-the-new-nuclear-arms-race>

Less than a decade after President Barack Obama called for the abolition
of nuclear weapons, the nine countries that possess them are engaged in
a new nuclear-arms race. North Korea has most likely developed a
hydrogen bomb, and its Hwasong-15 missiles may be large enough to
transport not only a warhead but also decoys, chaff, and other
countermeasures that would thwart America's Ground-Based Midcourse
Defense anti-ballistic-missile system. India recently commissioned its
second ballistic-missile submarine, launched an Agni-5 ballistic missile
that can strike targets throughout Pakistan and China, and tested
nuclear-capable BrahMos and Nirbhay cruise missiles. Pakistan now has
the world's fastest-growing nuclear stockpile, including low-yield
warheads on Hatf-9 missiles for use against Indian troops and armored
vehicles. Israel is expanding the range of its Jericho III ballistic
missiles and deploying cruise missiles with nuclear weapons on
submarines. France and the United Kingdom are developing replacements
for their Vanguard and Triomphant ballistic-missile submarines. China is
about to introduce Dongfeng-41 ballistic missiles that will be mounted
on trucks, loaded with up to ten nuclear warheads, and capable of
reaching anywhere in the United States. Russia is building a wide range
of new missiles, bombers, and submarines that will carry nuclear
weapons. The R-28 Sarmat missile, nicknamed Satan-2, will carry up to
sixteen nuclear warheads---more than enough for a single missile to
destroy every American city with a population larger than a million
people. Russia plans to build forty to fifty of the Satan-2s. Three
other countries---Iran, Japan, and South Korea---may soon try to obtain
their own nuclear arsenals. In the preface to the Nuclear Posture
Review, released in February by the Trump Administration, Secretary of
Defense James Mattis expresses the new American point of view: "We must
look reality in the eye and see the world as it is, not as we wish it to
be." [That [reality]{.mark}, according to the Pentagon,
[requires]{.mark} a full renovation of the Cold War nuclear triad---[new
i]{.mark}ntercontinental [b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile[s]{.mark},
new l[ong-range bombers, and]{.mark} new [ballistic-missile
submarines]{.mark}.]{.underline} It also requires new, low-yield
"tactical" warheads and bombs, a category of weapons once considered so
destabilizing that President George H. W. Bush removed almost all of
them from active service, in 1991. The cost of rebuilding America's
nuclear arsenal is projected to be more than a trillion dollars, spent
over the course of thirty years. [The growing danger of the nuclear-arms
race has failed to inspire much debate.]{.underline} Nuclear policy is
no longer widely discussed in the media; the public has been told little
about a subject of existential importance; and questions once
passionately argued have been largely forgotten. Why do we have nuclear
weapons? What they are for? How might they be used? And, at a time when
a single American submarine can destroy the capital city of every
country in the United Nations, how much is enough? Instead, these
questions are being addressed by a small group of policymakers. Many of
the crucial details are top secret, and the mundane terms used in
official discussions tend to hide the apocalyptic consequences at stake.
"Mutual deterrence," "flexible response," "counterforce,"
"countervalue," "buffer distance," "ladders of escalation," "circular
error probable," "releasing commander," "release other than attack,"
"nuclear umbrellas," "nuclear posture," "force elements," "yield,"
"penetration aids"---none of these sound too alarming. But one term
truly evokes its meaning. A "megadeath" is a unit of measurement in
nuclear warfare. Ten megadeaths, for example, means that ten million
people have been killed. The targeting strategies of today's nuclear
powers stem from the aerial-bombing campaigns of the Second World War,
when the distinction between hitting military assets and killing
civilians disappeared. After the German bombing of the Spanish city of
Guernica, and the Japanese attack on the Chinese city of Nanking,
President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the destruction of cities
"inhuman barbarism" in a 1939 statement, demanding that combatants
"under no circumstances, undertake the bombardment from the air of
civilian populations." The United States Army Air Forces tried to
minimize civilian casualties during its attacks on Germany, flying
missions in daylight, aiming at military and economic targets, and
attempting to carry out "precision bombing." But the U.K.'s Royal Air
Force, under the direction of Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Air
Marshall Sir Arthur (Bomber) Harris, flew at night, aimed at residential
areas, and tried to cause maximum devastation. Known as "de-housing,"
the British policy sought to break the morale of the German people.
Unfavorable weather patterns over Japan and racism shifted the focus of
American bombing there from military and economic targets to the
civilian population. As the historian John Dower has noted, the war with
Japan was a "war without mercy." The Japanese used conventional,
chemical, and biological weapons to kill as many as ten million to
fifteen million people, mainly in China, and the United States did not
hesitate to employ practices condemned a few years earlier as barbaric.
A great deal has been written about the ethics of President Harry
Truman's decision to destroy the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with
atomic bombs. Much less attention has been given to Roosevelt's support
for the use of firebombs against more than sixty Japanese cities. Those
attacks subjected about a third of Japan's population to aerial
bombardment and killed perhaps a million civilians. More people died
during the firebombing of Tokyo in March, 1945, than during the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima. According to a subsequent account by the United
States Strategic Bombing Survey, "Probably more persons lost their lives
by fire at Tokyo in a 6-hour period than at any \[other\] time in the
history of man." [[The atomic bomb revolutionized]{.mark} modern
[warfare]{.mark} not [by]{.mark} [enabling]{.mark} the [mass
slaughter]{.mark} of civilians but [by]{.mark} vastly [increasing its
efficiency]{.mark}---the ease with which densely populated cities could
be annihilated]{.underline}. The destruction of Tokyo had been achieved
by about three hundred American planes dropping roughly eight thousand
bombs. [Hiroshima was destroyed by a single plane carrying one
bomb.]{.underline} After the Second World War, the United States
mothballed hundreds of ships, cut the number of military aircraft by
more than two-thirds, reduced the size of the U.S. Army by almost ninety
per cent, and halted the production of atomic bombs. The Cold War began
at a time when American military forces in Europe were outnumbered
roughly ten to one by the Soviet Union's Red Army. Unable to defend
Western Europe with soldiers and tanks, the United States chose to deter
a Soviet invasion by threatening to drop atomic bombs on Soviet cities.
One of the early war plans, called trojan, listed seventy cities as
targets. They would be struck by a hundred and thirty-three atomic
bombs. Moscow would be hit by eight; Leningrad, by seven. Conservative
estimates predicted that about seven million Soviet civilians would be
killed or wounded. Threatening the mass slaughter of noncombatants had
come to be seen as the only means of safeguarding freedom and preventing
another world war. The advent of hydrogen bombs seemed to endanger no
less than the future of humanity. The new weapons could be made
hundreds, if not thousands, of times more powerful than the bomb that
destroyed Hiroshima. J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the "father of the
atomic bomb," opposed the development of the H-bomb, and, in 1951, he
strongly advocated the development of low-yield, "tactical" nuclear
weapons that would be aimed at military targets. He hoped to minimize
civilian casualties and limit the scale of a nuclear war. If the Soviet
Union invaded Western Europe, Oppenheimer supported using tactical
weapons against tanks, troops, and airfields. The idea of bringing "the
battle back to the battlefield" was later endorsed by a young Harvard
academic, Henry Kissinger, who imagined nuclear wars in which
adversaries fired only tactical nuclear weapons at each other, obeyed
rules of engagement, paused the fighting to negotiate, and agreed to
spare cities from harm. Confronted with a choice between tactical
weapons and more powerful strategic weapons, the United States decided
to build both. The Navy got nuclear depth charges, torpedoes, cruise
missiles, gravity bombs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The
Army got nuclear artillery shells, land mines, anti-aircraft missiles,
ground-to-ground missiles, and even the Davy Crockett, a recoilless
rifle carried by infantrymen that shot a small nuclear projectile. The
U.S. Special Forces got "backpack nukes" for sabotage missions behind
enemy lines. And the Air Force got the most lethal nuclear weapons of
all, mounted on cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and bombers.
American war plans relying on tactical weapons and those relying on
strategic weapons were in many ways incompatible[. [The Atomic Energy
Act of 1946 specified that the President had the sole authority
to]{.mark} order the [use]{.mark} of [a nuclear
weapon.]{.mark}]{.underline} That authority was later embodied in
America's main nuclear-war plan, the Single Integrated Operational Plan
(siop)---a highly-centralized scheme that launched nuclear weapons in an
all-out attack on the Soviet Union and its allies. But a Soviet invasion
of Western Europe might sideline the siop: tactical weapons would only
be effective on the battlefield if they could be used immediately. The
commander of an American infantry division, about to be overrun by the
Red Army, might not have time to call the White House and wait for
Presidential approval before authorizing the firing of his nuclear
artillery shells and Davy Crocketts. As a result, during the Eisenhower
Administration, the authority to use nuclear weapons was secretly
delegated to relatively low-level American officers assigned to nato.
They could decide when to go nuclear. Once the first tactical weapon
detonated on a battlefield, the escalation of the conflict would be hard
to control. Communications could prove impossible amid the nuclear
blasts, and a Third World War might begin without the President's
knowledge or approval. By deploying large numbers of both tactical and
strategic weapons, the United States embraced a nuclear decision-making
process that was simultaneously centralized and decentralized---and
bound to be chaotic in a crisis. Throughout the Cold War, the proper
size and composition of America's nuclear arsenal was a continual source
of debate, as each military service championed its own role in any
conflict. During the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the United States should have
enough nuclear weapons to fulfill two objectives: deter a Soviet attack
and limit the damage of such an attack by destroying Soviet nuclear
forces. If deterrence failed, at a bare minimum, regardless of the
circumstances, McNamara believed that the United States should always be
able to kill at least a quarter of the Soviet population and eliminate
at least two-thirds of its industrial capacity. That level of "assured
destruction," he later told President Lyndon B. Johnson, "would
certainly represent intolerable punishment to any industrialized nation
and thus should serve as an effective deterrent." But the nuclear-weapon
requirements for "damage limitation" could become endless, as the Soviet
Union expanded its nuclear arsenal and the number of military targets
there multiplied. The U.S. Air Force initially wanted ten thousand
long-range ballistic missiles to attack Soviet nuclear forces,
leadership bunkers, and other strategic targets, but later settled for a
tenth of that number. The Army wanted a hundred and fifty-one thousand
tactical nuclear weapons to hit battlefield targets, but eventually
obtained about a twentieth of that number. The Navy argued that a few
hundred nuclear warheads, mounted atop missiles in its submarines and
aimed at Soviet cities, would keep the peace, guarantee deterrence, and
render all those Army and Air Force weapons unnecessary. Although the
Navy's strategy of "minimum deterrence" would limit the size of
America's nuclear arsenal, it would focus almost entirely on
slaughtering civilians. The interservice rivalries and competing nuclear
strategies led to a remarkable degree of overkill. America's first
nuclear-war plan approved by the joint chiefs, known as Halfmoon, had
assumed that dropping fifty atomic bombs on the Soviet Union would
devastate the country. By the late nineteen-eighties, the United States
had more than twenty thousand nuclear weapons, and planned to use almost
four hundred of them just to strike targets in Moscow. The Soviet Union
built a similar mix of tactical and strategic forces to deter the United
States---and had more than forty thousand nuclear weapons at the end of
the Cold War. The world's other nuclear powers harbored much smaller
arsenals and simpler ambitions. In China, Chairman Mao was dismissive of
America's "small stack of atom bombs," suggesting that his country's
huge population could survive any attack and wouldn't be "cowed by U.S.
atomic blackmail." China pursued a policy of minimum deterrence, planned
only to destroy American cities, and never had more than a few hundred
nuclear weapons. The United Kingdom showed little interest in hitting
Soviet military targets, and its nuclear-war plans increasingly focussed
on "the Moscow criterion," a threat to destroy the capital of the Soviet
Union. France had a nuclear policy known as "deterrence of the strong by
the weak," operating a command structure independent of nato and
targeting Soviet cities. President Charles de Gaulle compared the
thinking behind the strategy to that of a man walking in an ammunition
dump with a cigarette lighter. "Of course, if he lights up, he'll be the
first to blow," de Gaulle explained. "But he will also blow all those
around." The Fourth Geneva Convention extends legal protection to
civilians during wartime. The rules against deliberately harming
noncombatants were expanded by two additional protocols, in 1977. "The
civilian population . . . shall not be the object of attack," Protocol
II states. "Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is
to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited." Despite
that admonition, today's nuclear-targeting policies in many ways
resemble medieval hostage-taking. The innocent are threatened with
murder in order to preserve the peace. Pakistan is now moving away from
that sort of minimum deterrence to a more complex strategy known as
"full-spectrum deterrence," building tactical nuclear weapons to offset
India's superiority in troop strength and conventional weapons. Much
like nato during the Cold War, Pakistan assumes that tactical weapons
will deter an invasion or defeat the invading army without endangering
cities. But Pakistan now faces many of the same risks and challenges
that nato once encountered. To be effective on the battlefield, tactical
weapons need to be widely dispersed and available for immediate use,
making them more vulnerable to theft, sabotage, and unauthorized use.
They may also make nuclear war more likely. Because the destructive
effects of tactical weapons are smaller, the temptation to use them may
be greater. [[Once the "nuclear taboo" has been broken, nobody can be
certain what will happen]{.mark} next.]{.underline} At Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, nuclear weapons were used against a nation that didn't have
them. Russia and the United States possess about ninety per cent of the
world's approximately fifteen thousand nuclear weapons, maintaining
arsenals large and diverse enough to hit a variety of targets. The most
recent Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United States, issued by the
Obama Administration, in 2016, is a veritable jobs program for weapons
of mass destruction. It emphasizes the importance of destroying
counterforce (military) targets rather than countervalue (civilian)
targets, and it vows to "minimize collateral damage to civilian
populations," in keeping with international law. The Trump
Administration's Nuclear Posture Review advocates a strategy that sounds
oddly elegant: "tailored deterrence." Its objectives include preventing
a nuclear attack on the United States, protecting American allies from
attack, and, if deterrence fails, ending "any conflict at the lowest
level of damage possible and on the best achievable terms." Russia has
also changed its nuclear strategy. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union
claimed that it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons. But
Russia is no longer confident that its conventional forces are superior
to those of nato, and so it has embraced an "escalate to de-escalate"
strategy, raising the possibility of the use of tactical weapons against
nato troops. The strategy is based on a faith that low-yield nuclear
blasts will impose "tailored" damage on nato, de-escalate the conflict,
and force a ceasefire. The strategy presumes that nato won't retaliate
by using nuclear weapons, too. The change in Russian doctrine has
prompted the Trump Administration to seek new low-yield, tactical
weapons. The Administration believes that its new tactical weapons will
deter the Russians from ever using their own---reversing a bipartisan
consensus that for the past quarter century has regarded these weapons
as gravely and needlessly dangerous. At the height of the Cold War, the
United States kept about seven thousand tactical nuclear weapons in
Europe. The utility of those weapons was always in doubt. During Carte
Blanche, a war game conducted in 1955, three hundred and thirty-five
nato tactical weapons were used against invading Soviet tanks and
troops, for the most part on battlefields in Germany. Robert McNamara
later outlined the results: "It was estimated that between 1.5 and 1.7
million people would die and another 3.5 million would be wounded---more
than five times the German civilian casualties in World War II---in the
first two days." Those estimates did not include deaths from illness,
radiation poisoning, or Soviet nuclear weapons. Subsequent war games
confirmed the findings of Carte Blanche: if nato ever used tactical
weapons to defend Germany, it would destroy Germany. The mere existence
of tactical weapons could destabilize a crisis and make it end badly.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F. Kennedy and his
advisers didn't know that the Soviet forces on the island and in the sea
surrounding it not only had tactical weapons but also had the ability to
use them without consulting Moscow. An American attack---contemplated
for days at the White House and nearly set in motion---would have
unwittingly led to a nuclear war. After the collapse of the Soviet
Union, in 1991, the United States unilaterally removed all of its
tactical weapons from South Korea and almost all of them from Europe.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, General Colin
Powell, had trained in the employment of tactical nuclear weapons as a
young officer and thought that they "had no place on a battlefield."
With the support of every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell
persuaded Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and President George H. W.
Bush to get rid of them, and over the years the size of nato's tactical
nuclear stockpile fell by ninety-seven per cent. Today, the United
States keeps about two hundred tactical weapons at six nato bases in
Germany, Belgium, Turkey, Italy, and the Netherlands. The weapons are
B-61 bombs designed to be carried by fighter planes. They have no
assigned role in nato's war plans, and their military usefulness is
"practically nil," according to General James Cartwright, a former
commander of the United States Strategic Command. The B-61 bombs have
been retained as symbols of America's commitment to the defense of nato,
despite concern that the weapons are vulnerable to theft by terrorists,
sabotage, and attack, especially in Turkey. [A few B-61s could fit in
the bed of a pickup truck. Experts fear that [B-61 nuclear
bombs,]{.mark} [which can fit in]{.mark} the bed of [a pickup truck, are
vulnerable to theft from U.S. bases]{.mark} abroad.]{.underline} A
retired Marine general described their military usefulness as
"practically nil."Photograph Courtesy Randy Montoya / Sandia National
Laboratories The Trump Administration is moving forward with plans to
modernize the B-61 and would like to mount low-yield tactical warheads
on submarine-based missiles. The advantage of basing tactical weapons on
a submarine is that they will be hidden underwater---and therefore will
be less likely to be stolen, attacked, or become the subjects of
political protests. The disadvantage is that Russia will have no way of
knowing whether a missile launched from a submarine is carrying a
tactical warhead meant to destroy a tank battalion on the battlefield or
a strategic warhead fired to destroy an underground leadership bunker in
Moscow. The glaring problem of how the President of the United States
and the President of Russia might reliably communicate and negotiate
during a limited nuclear war has never been resolved. The
Moscow-Washington Direct Communications Link, known as the "hotline,"
isn't a voice link with matching red telephones, as portrayed in
Hollywood thrillers. It's a dedicated computer link that transmits
encrypted e-mails between the Kremlin and the Pentagon. A recent
photograph of the hotline is not reassuring: it looks like a computer
terminal you might find in the business center at a Marriott hotel. The
return of tactical weapons is the most controversial aspect of Trump's
Nuclear Posture Review. The new policy assumes that American tactical
weapons will deter the use of Russian tactical weapons, raising "the
nuclear threshold" and making "nuclear employment less likely." Sam
Nunn, a former chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services
and a co-founder of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, has argued against
that sort of thinking for more than forty years. He fears that the
chance of accidents, miscalculations, and blunders with tactical
weapons---as well as the pressure to "use them or lose them" in
battle---greatly increase the risk of an all-out nuclear war. Like so
many of the disagreements about nuclear strategy, this one cannot be
settled with empirical evidence, and selecting the wrong policy could be
catastrophic. As Nunn observed in 1974, after a tour of nato's tactical
nuclear units, "Nobody has any experience in fighting nuclear wars, and
nobody knows what would happen if one were to start." On the morning of
August 6, 1945, Setsuko Thurlow, then thirteen years old, was preparing
to decode messages on the second floor of the Army headquarters in
Hiroshima. About twenty girls from her school worked beside her, and
thousands of other middle schoolers were employed at patriotic tasks
throughout the city as part of the Student Mobilization Program. Thurlow
noticed a bright bluish-white flash outside the window at 8:15 a.m. She
never saw the mushroom cloud; she was in it. She felt herself fly
through the air, blacked out, and awoke pinned in the rubble of the
collapsed building, unable to move. Lying there in silence and total
darkness, she had a feeling of serenity. And then she heard the cries of
classmates trapped nearby: "God, help me!," "Mother, help me!" Someone
touched her, removed the debris on top of her, and told her to crawl
toward the light. She somehow made it out safely and realized that what
was left of the headquarters was on fire. A half dozen or so other girls
survived, but the rest were burned alive. The smoke and dust in the air
made the morning look like twilight. As Thurlow and a few classmates
left the city center and walked toward the hills, they witnessed one
grotesque scene after another: dead bodies; ghostly figures, naked and
burned, wandering the streets; parents desperately searching for lost
children. She reached an Army training ground in the foothills, about
the size of two football fields. Every inch of ground was covered with
wounded people begging for water. There seemed to be no doctors, no
nurses, no medical help of any kind. Thurlow tore off strips of her
clothing, dipped them in a nearby stream, and spent the day squeezing
drops of water from them into the mouths of the sick and dying. At
night, she sat on the hillside and watched Hiroshima burn. Thurlow was
reunited with her parents. But her sister and her sister's four-year-old
son died several days later. Her sister's face had grown so blackened
and swollen that she could only be recognized by her voice and her
hairpin. Soldiers threw her body and that of her son into a ditch,
poured gasoline on them, and set them on fire. Thurlow stood and
watched, in a state of shock, without shedding a tear. Her favorite aunt
and uncle, who lived in the suburbs outside Hiroshima and appeared
completely unharmed, died from radiation poisoning a few weeks after the
blast. More than seven decades later, on the afternoon of December 10,
2017, I watched Thurlow accept the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the
International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ican). It was a
remarkable moment, as she slowly walked to the podium with a cane, and
the crowd in Oslo's City Hall gave a standing ovation. After the
bombing, Thurlow attended universities in Hiroshima and Lynchburg,
Virginia. Later, she earned a master's degree in social work at the
University of Toronto. She married a historian and settled in Canada.
She began her anti-nuclear activism in 1954, and became a leading
advocate for survivors of the atomic bombings, known as the hibakusha. A
few years ago, I spent time with her in Stockholm, meeting with
academics and legislators to discuss the nuclear threat. In her early
eighties, she was sharp, passionate, tireless, and free of bitterness.
"Today, I want you to feel in this hall the presence of all those who
perished in Hiroshima and Nagasaki . . . a great cloud of a quarter of a
million souls," Thurlow said in her Nobel speech. "Each person had a
name. Each person was loved by someone. Let us insure that their deaths
were not in vain." The movement to abolish nuclear weapons began soon
after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In January, 1946, the
first resolution of the United Nations General Assembly called for "the
elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons," and during the
Cold War every American President supported that goal, with varying
degrees of sincerity. On September 25, 1961, addressing the U.N. General
Assembly, President Kennedy gave perhaps the most eloquent speech on
behalf of abolition. "Every man, woman, and child lives under a nuclear
sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of
being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or madness," he
said. "The risks inherent in disarmament pale in comparison to the risks
inherent in an unlimited arms race." That week, Kennedy also secretly
met with military advisers at the White House to discuss the pros and
cons of launching a nuclear surprise attack on the Soviet Union.
American and Soviet troops were confronting each other in Berlin, and a
war between the superpowers seemed possible. Kennedy wanted to hear the
benefits of striking first. [The casualties that would result from the
Single Integrated Operational Plan seemed excessive to him: an estimated
two hundred and twenty million deaths in the Soviet Union and China (not
including fatalities caused by fire).]{.underline} A Kennedy aide, Carl
Kaysen, had come up with a surprise-attack plan, focussing solely on air
bases and missile sites. He predicted that it would kill "less than
1,000,000, and probably not much more than 500,000." The problem with
the plan, he acknowledged, was that it might not eliminate all of the
Soviet Union's nuclear weapons---which could prove unfortunate for
cities like New York and Chicago. If the United States launched a
surprise attack on the Soviets, the likely American death toll was
somewhere between five million and thirteen million. But, if the Soviets
attacked the United States first, perhaps a hundred million Americans
would die. "In thermonuclear warfare," Kaysen observed, "people are easy
to kill." Kennedy wrestled with the dilemma, decided not to launch a
surprise attack, and made his feelings clear at the U.N.: "Together we
shall save our planet, or together we shall perish in its flames." The
height of anti-nuclear sentiment in the United States occurred during
the Reagan Administration, amid renewed tensions with the Soviet Union.
An opinion poll in 1983 found that about half of the American people
thought that they'd die in a nuclear war. The Nuclear Freeze Movement
and worldwide anti-nuclear protests helped to transform Ronald Reagan
from an ardent Cold Warrior into a nuclear abolitionist. At a 1986
summit in Reykjavik, Reagan and the Soviet leader at the time, Mikhail
Gorbachev, nearly reached an agreement to get rid of all of their
countries' nuclear weapons. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
fear of nuclear war receded, and arms-control agreements between the
United States and Russia cut the number of nuclear weapons by about
eighty per cent. Republican Presidents had proved especially effective
at reducing the nuclear threat. President Richard Nixon signed the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, committing the
United States to seek "cessation of the nuclear arms rate at an early
date and nuclear disarmament." President George H. W. Bush cut the size
of America's nuclear arsenal by half. And President George W. Bush cut
it in half again. In 2007, the abolition movement was revived by an
unlikely group of people: the leadership of the American
national-security establishment. Two former Republican Secretaries of
State, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, joined two influential
Democrats, former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry and Sam Nunn,
the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in writing
an editorial for the Wall Street Journal, whose title aptly conveyed
their goal clear: "A World Free of Nuclear Weapons." A new anti-nuclear
group, Global Zero, was formed in 2008 by an international assortment of
military, diplomatic, and political leaders. Both the Democratic and the
Republican candidates for President that year, Barack Obama and John
McCain, supported nuclear abolition. The revitalized movement reached
its apogee on April 6, 2009, when Obama gave a speech about nuclear
weapons in Prague's Hradčany Square. He said that the United States had
a moral responsibility, as the only country that has used nuclear
weapons, to lead the international effort to abolish them. "Some argue
that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked,"
Obama said. "Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for, if we believe
that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we
are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is
inevitable." Nine years later, nuclear weapons have regained their
sinister allure. [[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [has]{.mark} repeatedly
[threatened to launch a nuclear attack]{.mark} [on the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, producing elaborate videos that show the destruction of
the White House and the U.S. Capitol. During a speech by the Russian
President, Vladimir [Putin,]{.mark} in March, computer animations
projected on a large screen behind him [showed Russian nuclear
warheads]{.mark} [descending over]{.mark} the state of [Florida]{.mark},
perhaps aimed at Mar-a-Lago. And President [Trump has delivered]{.mark}
the sorts of [nuclear threats that only Soviet leaders used to
make]{.mark}, promising to unleash "fire and fury" and boasting about
the size of his "button."]{.underline} Nuclear weapons are once again
being depicted as good, valuable things, the measure of national status
and strength. The current arms race between the United States and Russia
betrays the same assumptions as the last one: that new weapons will be
better, and that technological innovations can overcome the nuclear
threat. It's a familiar delusion. [William Perry, who's been involved in
nuclear matters for more than half a century, believes that t[he risk of
a nuclear catastrophe is greater today than it was]{.mark} at any time
[during the Cold War.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, unfortunately, agrees with him, and in January moved the
hand of its Doomsday Clock to two minutes before midnight. The Cold War
arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union has been
replaced by a multipolar nuclear competition, with far more volatile
dynamics. [[Russia faces]{.mark} possible [nuclear attacks by the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [China,]{.mark} France, and [the
U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom. [India]{.mark} must [worry about China
and Pakistan.]{.mark} [China must deter the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [India,]{.mark} and [Russia]{.mark}. North Korea feels
threatened by the United States, while some politicians in Japan and
South Korea advocate developing their own nuclear weapons to counter
those of North Korea. [Nuclear terrorism poses a global
threat.]{.mark}]{.underline} And everyone, it seems, hates the United
States. Moreover, the aftermath of a nuclear war may be even more dire
than anything anticipated during the Cold War. In the nineteen-eighties,
the astronomer Carl Sagan brought public attention to the danger of
"nuclear winter," a sudden and extreme form of climate change that would
be precipitated by the dust and debris rising into the atmosphere as
mushroom clouds from obliterated cities. [The latest studies suggest
that [a relatively small nuclear exchange would have long-term effects
across the globe.]{.mark} [A war between India and Pakistan,]{.mark}
involving a hundred atomic bombs like the kind dropped on Hiroshima,
[could send five million tons of dust into the atmosphere, shrink the
ozone layer by]{.mark} as much as [fifty per cent,]{.mark} [drop
worldwide temp]{.mark}erature[s to their lowest point]{.mark} in a
thousand years, [create worldwide famines,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} cause
[more than **a billion** casualties.]{.mark} An [all-out war between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia would have atmospheric
effects that are vastly worse.]{.mark}]{.underline} The fact that
launching a nuclear attack would be suicidal as well as genocidal hasn't
put an end to nuclear-war planning. Nor does the prospect of Armageddon
loom as an effective deterrent. Some religious fanatics celebrate the
slaughter of civilians and have no reluctance to die for their gods,
while leaders like Syria's Bashar al-Assad have been willing to use
banned chemical weapons and bring on the destruction of their own
countries rather than surrender power. An eagerness to embrace death
undermines the logic of nuclear deterrence, while a determination to
kill may perversely uphold it. In a recent documentary, Putin said that
his country would only use its nuclear weapons in retaliation---and that
he wouldn't hesitate to use them. "Why do we need a world," he asked,
"if Russia ceases to exist?" The International Campaign to Abolish
Nuclear Weapons was formed in 2007. It seeks to reframe public attitudes
toward nuclear weapons and gain ratification of an international treaty
banning them. ican contends that the same rationale used to outlaw
chemical weapons, biological weapons, land mines, and cluster
munitions---their cruel, indiscriminate harm to civilians---should be
applied to the deadliest weapons of all[. According to the World Health
Organization, [no nation has the medical facilities]{.mark} or
emergency-response capability [to deal with the detonation of a single
nuclear weapon]{.mark} in a city, [let alone
hundreds.]{.mark}]{.underline} After a nuclear blast, as in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, survivors would have to fend for themselves. ican wants to
stigmatize nuclear weapons, portraying them as inherently immoral and in
violation of international law, not symbols of power or guarantors of
national security. In July, 2017, the Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons, sponsored by ican, was endorsed by a hundred and
twenty-two of the hundred and ninety-three countries in the United
Nations. The treaty will attain legal force after being signed and
ratified by fifty. It forbids the testing, development, production,
acquisition, manufacture, and possession of nuclear weapons. Last
November, Pope Francis backed the treaty, altering the Catholic Church's
position on nuclear weapons; the Vatican had long opposed their use in
war and advocated nuclear disarmament, but recognized their value in
deterring war. Francis called nuclear weapons "senseless from even a
tactical standpoint," criticized their "catastrophic humanitarian and
environmental effects," and "firmly condemned" any possession of them. A
month later, the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to ican---an
impressive achievement for an organization with only three full-time
employees and a part-time office temp. ican's success has been driven by
thousands of idealistic volunteers who are mainly in their twenties and
thirties. During her Nobel lecture, Beatrice Fihn, the group's executive
director, a young and charismatic Swede, challenged the complacency of
world leaders. "It is not irrational to think nuclear states can
disarm," she said. "It is a necessity." The Trump Administration and the
eight other governments that have nuclear weapons vehemently disagree on
a wide range of issues, but they are united in opposition to ican's
treaty. They argue that it is poorly conceived, unverifiable,
unenforceable, unrealistic, and an invitation to nuclear blackmail.
"This treaty will not make the world more peaceful, will not result in
the elimination of a single nuclear weapon, and will not enhance any
state's security," the State Department said in a statement after the
group won the Nobel Peace Prize. The United States, France, and the
United Kingdom declined to send a representative to the award ceremony,
as a protest against the winner. Thirty-five years after President
Reagan promised an American missile-defense system that would somehow
blast dozens of nuclear-warhead-tipped missiles from the skies, his
dream remains unfulfilled. Pursuing it, at a cost of close to two
hundred billion dollars, has only pushed other nations to modernize
their nuclear arsenals. The exotic weapons recently announced by
Putin---long-distance undersea drones with nuclear warheads,
nuclear-powered cruise missiles that can circle the globe---aren't
necessary to evade a missile defense system. A hydrogen bomb hidden in a
forty-foot sailboat can do that. Nuclear wars remain unwinnable, despite
fantasies to the contrary. During the last two tests of American
interceptors, the missile-defense system failed to destroy a single
missile launched, even when it knew the trajectory. The many grievances
between the United States and Russia are serious. They include the
expansion of nato to the Russian border; American withdrawal from the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty; Russia's invasion of Georgia, seizure of
Crimea, and attack on eastern Ukraine; hostile propaganda; cyberwarfare;
and meddling in elections. But they hardly justify killing billions of
civilians. During a telephone call between Trump and Putin on March
20th, the two discussed resuming arms-control talks. If the two
countries, which possess nine-tenths of the world's nuclear weapons, can
agree to make significant cuts in their arsenals, the other nuclear
powers can be pressured to do the same. And if a meeting between Trump
and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, ever occurs, Kim should be
told that having nuclear weapons, for a wide variety of reasons, makes
the destruction of his country more likely. The abolition of nuclear
weapons will require unprecedented trust between nations, a strict
inspection regime, and severe punishments against any country that
cheats. Until the day when those things are possible, greatly reducing
the number of nuclear weapons, taking ballistic missiles off of alert,
and abandoning high-risk strategies will make the world a much safer
place. None of that will happen until people are willing to confront the
threat. "Yet in spite of the immeasurable importance of nuclear weapons,
the world has declined, on the whole, to think about them very much,"
Jonathan Schell wrote in "The Fate of the Earth," which was published in
The New Yorker thirty-six years ago. "This peculiar failure of response,
in which hundreds of millions of people acknowledge the presence of an
immediate, unremitting threat to their existence and to the existence of
the world they live in---but do nothing about it . . . has itself been
such a striking phenomenon that it has to be regarded as an extremely
important part of the nuclear predicament." Since the publication of my
book "Command and Control," in 2013, I've gotten to know the young
leadership of the nascent anti-nuclear movement, spoken at ican
gatherings, joined the board of the Ploughshares Fund (a foundation
dedicated to reducing the nuclear threat), and received financial
support for some of my work from the Nuclear Threat Initiative. I have
also met with many of the top officials at our nuclear-weapon
laboratories, with the leadership of the National Nuclear Security
Administration (the civilian agency in charge of our nuclear weapons),
and with the commanding officers at the Air Force Global Strike Command,
the unit responsible for our intercontinental ballistic missiles and
strategic bombers. What these disparate groups share is a strong and
sincere desire to avoid a nuclear war. But they don't agree about the
best way to do that. I hope the spirit now animating the demonstrations
against gun violence will soon offer resistance to the greatest possible
form of organized violence. As government officials in Washington,
Moscow, London, Paris, Beijing, New Delhi, Islamabad, Tel Aviv, and
Pyongyang discuss how to update and improve their arsenals, the madness
at the heart of the whole enterprise must be loudly asserted. How much
is enough? [The only rational answer: [even one nuclear weapon is **one
too many.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Trump is attacking the heart of American alliances:
trust]{.underline}]{.mark} In 1956, a leaked Defense Department [[memo
proposing the withdrawal of]{.mark} US troops [from]{.mark} Europe
[terrified European allies;]{.mark} German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer
declared privately that "NATO is finished."]{.underline} The Nixon
administration's diplomatic outreach to China in 1972 led both Japanese
and South Korean policymakers to fear that the US would cut ties to
curry favor with Beijing. Seoul even [began a covert nuclear weapons
program](http://m.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/governance/npt/PDFs/133hersman.pdf)
to defend itself in the event of American abandonment. These examples
illustrate a common historical pattern: Alliances between a stronger
state and weaker partners become at risk of collapse when the weaker
state no longer feels like it can trust the stronger state. "An alliance
may dissolve if its members begin to question whether their partners are
genuinely committed to providing assistance," [Harvard scholar Stephen
Walt](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F353329086%2FWALT-Why-Alliances-Endure-or-Collapse)
writes in a 1997 survey of the historical record. "This problem will be
more severe when \... there is a large asymmetry of power among the
member-states." [The US has prevented allies from truly losing faith in
the past basically by reassuring them. Presidents promise allies that
they'd never abandon them, and provide them tangible goods --- like US
troop deployments to their country, military assistance, or even trade
agreements --- to demonstrate America's continuing commitment.
[America's]{.mark} history of managing [allies]{.mark} speaks to a
fundamental truth about these agreements: They [are grounded entirely in
trust]{.mark}. Ultimately, an alliance is nothing but a promise: that
the United States will defend its allies, either in Europe or East Asia,
in the event of an unspecified future attack. There's nothing an ally
can do to force the United States into defending them; they just have to
take America's word for it.]{.underline} As a result, a country's
reputation for treating its allies well is crucially important to
determining whether its alliances can work. A [2008 paper by Douglas
Gibler](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/bleveck/assets/pdfs/how_international_reputation_matters.pdf),
a professor at the University of Alabama, found that [[states that did
not honor their commitment to allies]{.mark} in the past [were
considerably less likely to forge new alliances in the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trade pacts, environmental agreements, and
the Iran nuclear deal don't touch the core US promise in US military
alliances --- to defend allies in the event of an attack. But backing
out of such accords does serious damage to Trump's reputation as a
trustworthy ally. [Withdrawing the United States from major agreements
and imposing tariffs on allies, all while cozying up to Vladimir Putin
and sitting down with Kim Jong Un, tells US allies that [Trump doesn't
feel]{.mark} particularly [bound by formal agreements or the traditional
thrust of]{.mark} US [foreign policy]{.mark}. If he decides that an
agreement doesn't put "America First," he's perfectly willing to kick it
to the curb.]{.underline} Trump has openly said this in the past. In
July 2016, he told the New York Times that he would be willing to
disregard Article 5, the provision of NATO's founding treaty committing
allies to defending each other in the event of the attack. "[If we are
not going to be reasonably reimbursed for the tremendous cost of
protecting these massive nations with tremendous wealth ... then yes, I
would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations,
you will be defending yourself,'"]{.underline} Trump told [the
Times](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/21/12247074/donald-trump-nato-war).
Trump has tried to walk back that kind of rhetoric as president. But his
actions in the past year --- especially the snap cancellation of
longstanding military exercises with South Korea --- make [the threat of
abandonment seem all too credible to allies]{.underline}. [When]{.mark}
[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/28/574314910/trumps-relationship-with-nato-1-year-into-his-presidency)
[asked]{.mark} Tomas Valasek, the recently retired Slovak ambassador to
NATO[, [if Trump would defend]{.underline}]{.mark} [his country or
[another ally in the event of an attack, he couldn't bring himself to
say yes]{.mark}. "The honest answer is none of us quite
knows]{.underline}," Valasek said. ["His heart is not into alliance. He
has a zero-sum view of the world. He believes in no permanent
friendships, no permanent allies. You know, that's not the sort of
mindset that prepares him well for sort of standing by the side of an
ally in case of a crisis.]{.underline}" The result of Trump's reputation
for unreliability, then, is a weakening of American alliances. [[Allies
will trust the United States less]{.mark}, and may start looking for
alternatives to depending so heavily on the United States. [Enemies will
see cracks in US alliances and]{.mark} may attempt to [exploit
them]{.mark}. "The liberal international order depends on us believing
that agreements like treaties \[and\] international organizations have
long-term staying power beyond leadership change,"]{.underline} Brett
Ashley Leeds, a scholar of US alliances at Rice University, tells me.
"The scariest part is the fact that \[[Trump\] is creating so much
uncertainty about what US policy is going to be]{.underline}." How [the
weakening of American alliances could lead to a massive
war.]{.underline} There has never, in human history, been an era as
peaceful as our own. This is a hard truth to appreciate, given the
horrible violence ongoing in places like Syria, Yemen, and Myanmar, yet
the evidence is quite clear. Take a look at this chart from the
University of Oxford's Max Roser. It tracks the number of years in a
given time period in which "great powers" --- meaning the militarily and
economically powerful countries at that time --- were at war with each
other over the course of the past 500 years. The decline is
unmistakable: This data should give you some appreciation for how
unique, and potentially precarious, our historical moment is. For more
than 200 years, from 1500 to about 1750, major European powers like
Britain and France and Spain were warring constantly. The frequency of
conflict declined in the 19th and 20th centuries, but the wars that did
break out --- the Napoleonic conflicts, both world wars --- were
particularly devastating. T[he past 70 years without great power war, a
period scholars term "the Long Peace," is one of history's most
wonderful anomalies. The question then becomes: Why did it happen? And
could Trump mucking around with a pillar of the global order, American
alliances, put it in jeopardy? The answer to the second question,
ominously, appears to be yes.]{.underline} There is significant evidence
that [[strong American alliances]{.mark} --- most notably the NATO
alliance and US agreements to defend Japan and South Korea --- [have
been instrumental in putting an end to great power
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. "As this [[alliance system]{.mark} spreads and
expands, it [correlates with]{.mark} this dramatic decline, this
unprecedented [drop, in warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Michael
Beckley, a professor of international relations at Tufts University.
"It's a really, really strong correlation." A [2010
study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-8594.2010.00122.x/abstract)
by Rice's Leeds and the University of Kentucky's Jesse C. Johnson
surveyed a large data set on alliances between 1816 and 2000. They found
that [countries in defensive alliances were 20 percent less likely to be
involved in a conflict, on average, than countries that
weren't]{.underline}. This holds true even after you control for other
factors that would affect the likelihood of war, like whether a country
is a democracy or whether it has an ongoing dispute with a powerful
neighbor. In a [follow-up
paper](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/682074), Leeds
and Johnson looked at the same data set to see whether certain kinds of
alliances were more effective at protecting its members than others.
Their conclusion is that [[alliances deter war]{.mark} best when their
members are militarily powerful and when enemies take seriously the
allies' promise to fight together in the event of an
attack.]{.underline} The core US alliances --- NATO, Japan, and South
Korea --- fit these descriptors neatly. A third
[study](https://bc.sas.upenn.edu/system/files/Leeds_02.09.12.pdf) finds
evidence that alliances allow allies to restrain each other from going
to war. Let's say Canada wants to get involved in a conflict somewhere.
[Typically, it would discuss its plans with the United States first ---
and if America thinks it's a bad idea, Canada might well listen to them.
There's strong statistical evidence that countries don't even try to
start some conflicts out of fear that an ally would disapprove. These
three findings all suggest that NATO and America's East Asian alliances
very likely are playing a major role in preserving the Long Peace ---
which is why [Trump's habit of messing around with alliances is]{.mark}
so [dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to many Russia experts,
[Vladimir Putin's [deepest geostrategic
goal](https://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war) is "breaking"
NATO. The member states where anyone would expect him to test NATO's
commitment would be the Baltics --- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania ---
small former Soviet republics that recently became NATO members. We
can't predict if and when a rival like Putin would conclude that
America's alliances seemed weak enough to try testing them]{.underline}.
Hopefully, it never happens. [But [the more Trump attacks]{.mark} the
foundations of [America's allies, the more likely things are to
change.]{.mark} The absolute risk of a Russian invasion of a NATO state
or a North Korean attack on the South is relatively low, but [the
consequences are]{.mark} so potentially catastrophic --- [nuclear
war]{.mark}! --- that it's worth taking anything that increases the odds
of such a conflict seriously. The crack-up of the West? The world order
is a little like a game of Jenga]{.underline}. In the game, there are
lots of small blocks that interlock to form a stable tower. Each player
has to remove a block without toppling the tower. But each time you take
out a block, the whole thing gets a bit less stable. Take out enough
blocks and it will collapse. The international order works in kind of
the same way. [There are lots of different interlocking parts --- the
spread of democracy, American alliances, nuclear deterrence, and the
like --- that work together to keep the global peace. But take out one
block and the other ones might not be strong enough to keep things
together on their own.]{.underline} At [the end of the Cold
War](https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/113883), British and
French leaders worried that the passing of the old order might prove
destabilizing. In a January 1990 meeting, French President François
Mitterrand told British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that he
[feared](https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/113883) a united
Germany could seize control of even more territory than Hitler. Some
experts feared that in the absence of the external Soviet threat,
Western European powers might go back to waging war with each other.
[Thankfully, those predictions turned out to be wrong. There are
multiple reasons for that, but one big one --- one that also helped keep
relations between other historical enemies, like South Korea and Japan,
peaceful --- is a shared participation in US alliance networks. The US
serves as the ultimate security blanket, preventing these countries from
having to build up their own armaments and thus risk a replay of World
War I. But if American alliance commitments become and remain less
credible, it's possible this order could crack up. America's partners
aren't stupid. They understand that Trump is the product of deep forces
in American politics, and that his victory might not be a
one-off]{.underline}. If they think that this won't be the last "America
First" president in modern history, depending on America the way that
they have in the past could quickly become a nightmare. [The
[[worst-case
scenarios]{.mark}](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01636609509550148)
for a collapse in the US alliance system [are terrible]{.mark}. Imagine
full Japanese and German [rearmament, alongside rapid]{.mark}-fire
[prolif]{.mark}eration [of nuclear weapons]{.mark}. Imagine [a crack-up
of NATO, with European powers at loggerheads while Russia gobbles up the
Baltic states and the rest of Ukraine]{.mark}. Imagine [So]{.mark}uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea'[s]{.mark} historical [tensions with Japan reigniting,
and a war between those two countries]{.mark} or any combination of them
[and China]{.mark}.]{.underline} All of this seems impossible to imagine
now, almost absurd. And indeed, in the short run, it is. There is no
risk --- zero --- of American allies turning on each other in the
foreseeable future. And it's possible that the next president after
Trump could reassure American allies that nothing like this could ever
happen again. But the truth is that there's just no way to know. When a
fundamental force for world peace starts to weaken, no one can really be
sure how well the system will hold up. Nothing like this --- the leader
of the world's hegemon rounding on its most important allies --- has
ever happened before. [What Donald [Trump's]{.mark} presidency has done,
in effect, is start up another geopolitical Jenga game. Slowly but
surely, [he's removing the blocks that undergird global
security]{.mark}. It's possible the global order survives Trump --- but
it's just too early for us to say for sure. Given the stakes, it's a
game we'd rather not play.]{.underline}

### AT No Prolif: NPT

**NPT is [flawed]{.underline} -- some countries are already
[circumventing]{.underline} the treaty despite signing it**

**NATO Review 18** \[NATO Review is a free online magazine that offers
expert opinion about a range of security issues. It looks through
different perspectives at NATO's role in foreign policy. NATO review is
not associated with the government nor is a member of NATO. "The Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty at fifty: a midlife crisis." *NATO Review*, 29
June 2018,
[nato.int/docu/review/2018/Also-in-2018/the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty-at-fifty-a-midlife-crisis/EN/index.htm](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2018/Also-in-2018/the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty-at-fifty-a-midlife-crisis/EN/index.htm)\]

[The non-proliferation score of [**the NPT is not perfect**, as]{.mark}
a number of [countries have decided to cheat and pursue nuclear options
while remaining NPT parties]{.mark}. Yet, [because of the NPT, they have
had to pursue nuclear weapons covertly]{.mark}, constraining their
efforts.]{.underline} In some cases, it has bought time for them to
reconsider their nuclear options, or for outside intervention that has
prevented further progress. For example, Libya's pursuit of nuclear
weapons for almost 30 years was terminated in 2003, thanks to the
diplomatic efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States, and a
change of mind by the country's leader, Colonel Muammar Qaddafi. Iraq's
nuclear pursuit of almost 20 years was ended by the 1991 Gulf War, and
Syria's decade-long efforts were disrupted by Israel's 2007 attack on
the covert Al Kibar nuclear reactor. Those [[NPT countries that have
been caught cheating and have refused to abandon their clandestine
programmes]{.mark}]{.underline} have paid a significant price for
noncompliance. North Korea, which in 2003 announced its withdrawal from
the Treaty and soon acquired nuclear weapons capability, did it despite
extensive international sanctions and political isolation. Sanctions
imposed on Iran for its covert nuclear activities were eased after the
2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and Iran's renewed
commitment to abide by its obligations under the Treaty. Without the
NPT, the concerted global efforts to prevent, slow down, curb, punish
and reverse the actions of Iran and North Korea would be much more
difficult. The Treaty gives legitimacy to the non-proliferation norm and
to actions to enforce it. While [[the Treaty has significant
loopholes]{.underline},]{.mark} detection of illegal proliferation by
its safeguards system has mobilised efforts to strengthen verification
and enforcement. The exposure of Saddam Hussein's clandestine programme
in 1991 led to improvements of the IAEA's inspection authority with the
1997 Additional Protocol. The Protocol has been ratified by over 130
countries. The non-proliferation impact of the NPT Treaty has been
multiplied by a dense network of international initiatives and
agreements created to support the NPT goals, including [the
Nuclear-Weapon-Free
Zones](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/nwfz/), the
[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material](https://www.iaea.org/publications/documents/conventions/convention-physical-protection-nuclear-material),
the [Zangger Committee](http://zanggercommittee.org/), the [Nuclear
Suppliers Group](http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/en/), [United
Nations Security Council Resolution
1540](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/sc1540/), the [Proliferation
Security Initiative](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/PSI), and
the [Nuclear Security
Summits](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/NuclearSecuritySummit).
Together, these multilateral efforts reinforce the non-proliferation
regime and the NPT. Disarmament progress Article VI of the NPT commits
all parties to "pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures
relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to
nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament
under strict and effective international control". There are differences
among NPT parties on how to interpret this article, and a
nuclear-weapon-free world remains a distant vision. While there are
sharp differences among the five NPT nuclear-weapon states in terms of
numbers and variety of nuclear capabilities, the roles attached to these
capabilities and their attitudes toward reductions, they all defend
their disarmament records and their fidelity to Article VI. The United
States argues that its overall nuclear arsenal is [88 per cent
smaller](http://statements.unmeetings.org/media2/18559537/usa-2018-npt-prepcom_us-cluster-1-specific-issue-statement.pdf)
than its peak number. According to available data, between 1967 and 2017
the US arsenal
[shrank](https://open.defense.gov/Portals/23/Documents/frddwg/2017_Tables_UNCLASS.pdf)
from 31,255 to 3,822 warheads. Russia claims that it has decreased its
nuclear arsenal by more than [85 per
cent](http://statements.unmeetings.org/media2/18559498/russia-e-cluster-1-statement-russia-eng.pdf).
Under the limits of the 2010 New START Treaty, the deployed strategic
nuclear arsenals of the two biggest nuclear possessors are now capped at
their lowest level since the 1950s. The United Kingdom has announced the
reduction of its operational warheads to [no more than
12](http://statements.unmeetings.org/media2/18559565/uk-new-prepcom-pillar-i-uk-statement-2018docx.pdf)0.
France states that it has reduced the airborne and sea-based components
of its nuclear deterrent forces by one third and capped its overall
nuclear arsenal at [300
warheads](http://statements.unmeetings.org/media2/18559401/france-e-and-f-printer_20180425_150957.pdf).
China, the only NPT nuclear weapon state that does not claim any
reductions, assures that its nuclear arsenal is at "the [minimal
level](http://statements.unmeetings.org/media2/18559510/china-e-new-statement_cluster1_english.pdf)
required by national security". The nuclear weapon states argue that
these and other actions they have taken, including the voluntary
moratorium on nuclear testing, signify progress towards the goals
envisioned in Article VI. Progress toward nuclear disarmament remains,
however, the most serious bone of contention within the NPT. While the
nuclear weapon states highlight what they have achieved so far, a vast
majority of non-nuclear weapon states focus on what more needs to be
done. [[Non-nuclear-weapon states **criticise nuclear possessors for
slow progress** and for **not fulfilling their promises**]{.mark},
including falling short of achieving a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT)]{.underline}, which has not been ratified by China and the
United States. While nuclear-weapon states and US non-nuclear allies
claim that further progress toward disarmament must take into account
the overall security environment, [for the majority of
[non-nuclear-weapon states the time for nuclear disarmament is now and
arguments from countries relying on nuclear weapons are not
convincing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Risks of the current crisis The history
of the NPT is fraught with tensions and pessimism about the Treaty's
future. Four out of nine review conferences concluded without a
consensus statement. Over past decades, [there has been a [prevailing
perception among NPT observers that the Treaty is in bad shape and at
risk of becoming obsolete and eventually collapsing]{.mark}, because of
proliferation challenges and disputes about disarmament]{.underline}.
Discord among the NPT parties reached new levels on 7 July 2017 when 122
NPT members voted in favour of
[TPNW](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en),
which embraces the goal of outlawing all nuclear weapons, including
those possessed by the five NPT nuclear weapon states. The TPNW was
opened for signature in September 2017 and has already been signed by 59
countries and ratified by ten. According to its proponents, it
represents an effective measure under Article VI of the NPT by creating
a legally binding prohibition on nuclear weapons. For countries opposing
the [TPNW, including NATO Allies, the Treaty will not only be
ineffective but [risks
undermining](https://www.nato.int/cps/ua/natohq/news_146954.htm) the
NPT.]{.underline} The [[TPNW can be interpreted as a symptom of the
NPT's midlife crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} -- an expression of the
frustration of non-nuclear weapon states, which have a deep sense of
remorse for slow disarmament progress. For its advocates, the TPNW is
also an attempt to give nuclear disarmament new youth and energy.
Eventually, it may be possible for NPT members to find a formula of
compromise and agree to disagree on the new treaty. The troubles on the
horizon are not necessarily fatal, as the dissatisfaction of some States
Parties with disarmament progress does not seem sufficiently strong to
warrant withdrawal from the NPT. So far, at least, despite many worries,
no state seems prepared to make that choice. The common denominator of
both proponents and opponents of the TPNW is that their main goal is to
strengthen the NPT. Yet, the [TPNW further polarises the NPT process at
a time when longstanding points of tension take on new significance in a
changed security environment. Before any compromise on the TPNW can be
achieved, [the resilience of the NPT will be tested as never
before]{.mark}, which may have irreversible and highly undesirable
consequences]{.underline}. [[With the re-emergence of "great power
competition"]{.underline}]{.mark}, managing the disarmament demands of
the TPNW supporters will be increasingly difficult. Against the wishes
of many non-nuclear weapon states, [[the role of nuclear weapons in
international politics is not **decreasing but
growing.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

**Strong global alliances are key to US hegemony**

**Grygiel 18(**Jakub, associate professor of politics at the Catholic
University of America. Published: 10-25-2018 DOA: 7-4-19 wall e "The
Need for Allies"
<https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2018/11/12/the-need-for-allies/>

Alliances are one of the enduring assets of the United States. [[The
U.S]{.mark}. may be an empire, but it [is an empire of
alliances]{.mark}, not of colonies]{.underline} and dependencies.
[[Allies set the U.S]{.mark}. [apart]{.mark} from its rivals,
competitors, and enemies]{.underline} --- most of whom have few if any
allies. Indeed, these powers, from Russia to China to Iran, seek
protectorates and claim glory from conquest (e.g., Russia in Ukraine) or
from financial enslavement (e.g., China along its "One Belt, One Road"
project) rather than from the free association of polities. These
[[authoritarian states]{.mark} have fully succumbed to the temptation of
solitary powers mentioned above. This doesn't make them any less
dangerous; on the contrary, incapable of weaving a belt of friendly
allies around them and in support of their interests, they see [only
hostile targets of conquest]{.mark}. Solitary powers are inherently more
aggressive and violent]{.underline}. But the [value of allies for the
United States is much more than as a mark distinguishing it morally from
its rivals. [Allies are]{.mark} [indispensable for the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and are only becoming more so]{.underline}. [Four
interrelated reasons for this are worth considering: [geography, the
costs of projecting power]{.mark}, the nature of modern technology,
[and]{.mark}, perhaps most important, [the fragility of political
order]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[geographic nature]{.mark} [of American
power supplies a]{.mark}n enduring [reason]{.mark} that [the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [needs]{.mark} [allies]{.mark}. While
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is a state of continental
proportions, it is also a maritime power. Its [economic and geopolitical
heft is based on freedom of navigation on the oceans]{.mark}. But, as
has been true for all other maritime powers in history, the seas are
only the links to other regions from and with which the polity grows and
maintains its well-being.]{.underline} Freedom of navigation, which
depends on the ability of the U.S. or a friendly power to command the
seas, is a means, not an end in itself. [It supplies the United States
with access to the world, expanding market possibilities and protecting
it from potential foes with nefarious aspirations. [This is where allies
come in: They shape]{.mark} the [political]{.mark} and economic [life on
the other side of]{.mark} the [oceans]{.mark}, especially in Eurasia,
[instilling]{.mark} there the indispensable [regional
stability]{.mark}]{.underline}, domestic order, and economic growth.
[[Through these allies]{.mark}, a maritime power such as [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can shape political dynamics in distant
regions]{.mark}]{.underline}, a feat that is impossible by merely
controlling the seas and too costly to achieve through direct control.
For a maritime power, [alliances are an efficient and cheap way to be
more than a state with a large navy]{.underline}. Another way to put
this is that controlling the seas is necessary but insufficient to the
United States. Oceans (and, since the mid 20th century, air and space)
are highways rather than protective moats. [[Without]{.mark}
[allies]{.mark} on the other shore, mainly in Europe and Asia, [the
welfare]{.mark} and security [of the U.S. would demand]{.mark} an
impossibly [large expenditure of]{.mark} [resources]{.mark} in order to
build a navy, air force, and some sort of "space force" [to protect us
from]{.mark} the likely rise of [an enemy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even
then, it is doubtful that the U.S. would be safe from hostile actors
whose strategy is to avoid American strengths and use American
technology and politics to inflict damage. The U.S. cannot outspend its
rivals, and attempting to do so will lead to fiscal overextension. An
overly confident trust in the geographic separation of the U.S. from the
rest of the world has often translated into policy arguments in favor of
withdrawing into a "hemispheric defense" --- a posture that does not
require allies or friendly states on the other shores of the Pacific and
Atlantic oceans. War and the collapse of an existing equilibrium of
power in 1914 and 1939 woke Americans up to the bankruptcy of this
tempting vision of not needing allies and not having to support them.
Much intellectual effort went into debunking this temptation in the
1940s, with thinkers such as Nicholas Spykman and Walter Lippmann
penning books and essays demonstrating the dangers and costs of being a
maritime power without allies in Europe and Asia. But the temptation
remained, and the naïve belief that oceans combined with the naval
prowess of the United States would suffice to provide peace, security,
and well-being festered. Since then, [the [importance]{.mark} of
alliances [has only increased]{.mark}. In large measure [this has to do
with technological changes]{.mark} that have altered the strategic
landscape. For one, [allies provide needed entry points into particular
regions]{.mark}, especially for maritime and thus geographically distant
powers such as the United States]{.underline}. [[Were the U.S. to lose
its allies, a reentry]{.mark} into Europe or Asia [would be exceedingly
difficult and]{.mark}, most likely, [simply unfeasible because
of]{.mark} the required [costs]{.mark}. Projecting power into a distant
land across the sea has always been an arduous proposition, but the
array of defensive technologies developed in recent decades is making it
even more difficult than in the past]{.underline}. The so-called
"anti-access/area denial" set of capabilities that most of our rivals,
and China and Russia in particular, have been adeptly developing is a
vivid example of this trend. As a result, a 21st-century version of a
D-Day or a slow accumulation of American and allied forces such as the
one in Saudi Arabia preceding the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq is likely
to be prohibitively expensive and politically impossible for the United
States. [Continued American [support for allies]{.mark} in Europe and
Asia (and continued military presence there) [is the]{.mark} cheaper and
perhaps [only way of keeping stability]{.mark} and order. Another reason
allies are more important now than in earlier moments in history is
again tied to technology, in particular to its complexity.
[Alliances]{.mark} acquired and maintained in peacetime [can train
together]{.mark} and develop technologies and processes [that allow them
to be]{.mark} more [coordinated]{.mark}. The term used in policy
discussions is "interoperability," the ability of allied forces to
function in coordination with each other]{.underline}. Obviously this is
not a new challenge. Differences in language, for example, created
headaches for commanders of multinational coalitions throughout history.
Similarly, variations in training and discipline, or in the use of a
particular weapon, often weakened the effectiveness of an allied force
in the field.

<https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/05/how-to-win-americas-next-war-china-russia-military-infrastructure/>

[The era of [untrammeled U.S. military superiority is
over]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} If the United States delays
implementing a new approach, [[it risks losing a war to China or
Russia---or backing down]{.mark} in a crisis [because it fears it
would]{.mark}---with devastating consequences for America's
interests]{.underline}. The U.S. Defense Department's 2018 National
Defense Strategy initiated a needed course correction to address this
challenge. As then-Defense Secretary James Mattis put it in January that
year, great-power competition---not terrorism---is now the Pentagon's
priority. But while the strategy's summary provides a clear vision, it
leaves much to be fleshed out. What should this shift toward great-power
competition entail for the U.S. military? To answer, we must first
understand the current geopolitical landscape. As ever, [the foremost
concern of the United States is to maintain adequate levels of military
power; without it, there would be nothing to protect Washington from the
worst forms of coercion and every incentive for ambitious opponents to
exploit the ensuing leverage. Largely for that reason, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has an]{.mark} enduring [interest in
open access to the world's]{.mark} key [regions]{.mark}---primarily Asia
and Europe---to ensure their latent power is not turned against it. [The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [does so by maintaining]{.mark} favorable
balances of power in these regions through [a network of]{.mark}
[alliances. These]{.mark} partnerships [are not ends]{.mark} in
themselves [but]{.mark} rather [the way the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [makes sure]{.mark} that [no state dominates
these]{.mark} critical [areas. Russia and]{.mark} especially [China are
the only countries that could]{.mark} plausibly [take]{.mark}
over]{.underline} and hold the territory of Washington's allies and
partners in the face of U.S. resistance. [If they did so---or even if
they merely convinced their neighbors that they could and then used that
fear to suborn them---[they could unravel]{.mark} U.S.
[alliances]{.mark} and shift in their favor the balances of power in
Europe and Asia. [If China did so in the]{.mark} Western [Pacific, it
could dominate the]{.mark} world's largest and [most economically
dynamic region. If Russia did so, it could fracture NATO]{.mark} and
open Eastern]{.underline} Europe to Russian dominance. Beijing and
Moscow must therefore not be given such an opening, [which is why
[Washington must focus not on abstract metrics]{.mark} of its military
superiority]{.underline}---such as how many carriers it puts to sea or
how much it spends in comparison to other countries---[[but on
its]{.mark} and its [allies']{.mark} clear [ability to defeat major
aggression in]{.mark} specific, plausible [scenarios against a]{.mark}
[vulnerable ally]{.mark} or established partner such as
Taiwan]{.underline}. In other words, [the United States must prepare to
fight and achieve its political aims in a war with a great
power]{.underline}. Doing so will not be easy. The last time the United
States prepared for such a conflict was in the 1980s, and the last time
it fought one was in the 1940s. But that's all the more reason why
Washington must immediately start readying itself if it wants to deter
another great-power battle now.

as a [shock to America's allies in Seoul]{.underline}: [South Korean
President Moon

office released a statement saying "we need to find out the precise
meaning or intentions of President Trump's remarks," implying they had
no idea this was coming. The weekend before, at the G7 summit, a confab
for leaders of seven wealthy democracies, [[Trump got into a fight with
Canadian Prime Minister]{.mark} Justin Trudeau over trade.
When]{.underline}
[[Trudeau]{.underline}](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jun/11/context-what-justin-trudeau-said-made-donald-trump/)
[criticized Trump's imposition of new tariffs on steel and aluminum

one of his top trade advisers, [said]{.mark} on Fox News that [there was
"a special place in hell" for Trudeau]{.mark}. These two incidents
aren't the only times [Trump has [infuriated American allies]{.mark} in
the past year. Just last month, he [pulled]{.mark} the United States
[out of the [Iran nuclear
deal](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw)]{.mark}
--- a painstakingly negotiated agreement involving several of America's
top European allies]{.underline}. Last June, [he withdrew from the
[Paris climate
agreement](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/1/15719968/trump-paris-climate-agreement-world)]{.mark}.
And this all came amid constant carping about how America's NATO allies
needed to pay their "fair share," and after [Trump's]{.mark} past
[musings about how he might not defend allies]{.mark} if they didn't.
Trump's betrayal of South Korea and eruption at Trudeau are not
one-offs, or events you can write off as simple quirks of the
president's personality[. It is part of a broader slate of [Trump
policies]{.mark} and diplomatic efforts that have, put together,
[fundamentally]{.mark} [weaken]{.mark}ed [America's ties with]{.mark}
its traditional [allies]{.mark} --- in ways that could have potentially
disastrous consequences for the world. America's alliances depend on the
US's reputation for upholding its agreements and treating its allies
fairly. [Trump's]{.mark} blithe [disregard for diplomacy and
international agreements has damaged the US's reputation in a way
that]{.mark} some scholars worry [may be
irreparable]{.mark}]{.underline}. And a deep body of research on
international relations suggests that [the [strength of America's
alliances]{.mark} in Europe and East Asia [have]{.mark} played [a
pivotal role in preventing another world war]{.mark}. The more Trump
mucks around with American alliances, the more unstable the world
becomes --- making a large military conflict more
imaginable]{.underline}. Such a disaster hopefully will never happen.
Indeed, it's nearly impossible for most of us to imagine one happening
now: We live in [one of the most peaceful times in human
history](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/1/3/16843404/good-news-2017-global-health-development-war),
with some of the lowest rates of deaths in conflict ever recorded. But
that's precisely the point: [Our age is such an anomaly when it comes to
conflict that we aren't entirely sure what could trigger a return to the
violent historical norm. Serious, lasting damage to the American-led
alliance system might do the trick]{.underline}. And President Trump's
foreign policy could well be doing such damage. His approach is so
erratic, so contemptuous of America's traditional way of doing business,
that [US [allies are openly worrying]{.mark} in a way that we haven't
seen in modern history]{.underline}. This [[affects world politics at
their most fundamental level, undermining a]{.mark}n otherwise
[stable]{.mark} global [system in ways that we are only dimly capable of
perceiving]{.mark}. The past week's news was a particularly naked
demonstration of what had been, to date, one of the most subtle and
insidious effects of the Trump presidency: [an erosion of]{.mark} the

determined to press ahead. They [no longer feel the need to act in
parallel with us."]{.mark} Indeed, Sneider blogged that some [U.S.
officials]{.mark} "even [fear the alliance itself may be in
jeopardy."]{.mark}]{.underline} Meanwhile in Europe, no big whoop, just
French President Emmanuel Macron telling French diplomats some things
that would have made conservative national security folks set their hair
on fire if this had happened in the Obama era. [According to CNN's
Saskya Vandoorne: [French President]{.mark} Emmanuel Macron
[told]{.mark} France's overseas [ambassadors]{.mark} gathered in Paris
on Monday [that Europe can "no longer rely" upon the U.S. for]{.mark}
its [security]{.mark}. "[It is up to us]{.mark} today [to]{.mark} take
our responsibilities and **[guarantee our own security]{.mark}**, and
thus have European sovereignty," Macron said. \... [Macron said he
wanted to see a complete rethink of how Europe defends itself in the
future.]{.mark} "I want us to launch an exhaustive review of our
security with all Europe's partners, which includes Russia," he added.
This matches what German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in an op-ed
last week.]{.underline} According to the Financial Times's Guy Chazan:
Germany's foreign minister has called for the creation of a new payments
system independent of the U.S. as a means of rescuing the nuclear deal
between Iran and the West that Donald Trump withdrew from in May.
Writing in the German daily Handelsblatt, Heiko Maas said Europe should
not allow the US to act "over our heads and at our expense". "For that
reason it's essential that we strengthen European autonomy by
establishing payment channels that are independent of the US, creating a
European Monetary Fund and building up an independent Swift system," he
wrote. In the immortal words of "Brooklyn Nine-Nine's" Jake Peralta,
cool, cool, cool. It would be dangerous to read too much into this. U.S.
allies kvetching about the United States has been a staple of American
foreign policy for 70 years now. On Germany, it's important to remember
that foreign ministers do not have much say over payments systems, and
it's noteworthy that German Chancellor Angela Merkel slapped Maas down
hard over his comments, saying that Europe's security cooperation with
the United States remained "extremely useful." [On Korea, it's worth
noting that a U.S. official also told Sneider that "Moon will not risk
the domestic political cost of showing a visible gap with the U.S.,
particularly as his popular support is starting to soften." Still, [the
pattern is getting more visible]{.mark}. The longer Donald Trump stays
president, the [more U.S. allies seem ready to test the waters of
pursuing more independent foreign policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

*Underground Network,* "Nuclear Weapons and Proliferation: Effects and
Need of WMDs" \|\|
<https://underground.net/nuclear-weapons-and-proliferation-effects-and-need-of-wmds/>

Nuclear weapons are considered to be some of the world's most dangerous
armaments. Categorized as weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), they have
the capability of leveling cities, killing millions, and destroying the
environment for generations to come due to the extreme heat, blast wave,
and ionizing radiation they release. Evidence of their horrors is
paramount in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the
first and last nuclear attacks in history took place. In Hiroshima
80,000 people were killed instantly, with an additional 40,000 dying in
Nagasaki, and 100,000 more in the following months due to radiation
poisoning. The consequences continued to persist for decades, and
continue to do so today. Over seven decades later, victims continue to
suffer the cost of paranoia and belligerence. According to the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), As of March 2014 the
Japanese government officially recognized 192,719 living persons as
atomic bomb survivors or "hibakusha". Of these 119,169 were directly
exposed at the time of the atomic bombings, 45,260 were exposed by
entering the cities in the following weeks, 20,939 risked exposure
through relief, burial and similar activities and 7,351 were unborn
children at the time of the exposure of their parents (from the types of
exposure just listed). Studies showed that of those who survived, many
(mainly children) have faced various forms of cancer at higher rates
throughout their lives, including forms of leukemia that are generally
prevalent in elder people. According to ICRC, "This is attributed to
exposure of the entire body to radiation at the time of the bombing,
causing damage to stem cells in multiple organs which in turn can
produce abnormal cells that become cancerous." There is even the
possibility of "second generation" effects, as the children of those
exposed to radiation may, through radiation-damaged genes, develop
cancer in the age range that is highly responsive to the disease. Aside
from physical health issues, psychological health issues also abound.
Studies enacted in 1995 that incorporated the World Health Organization
methodologies found that many survivors had long-lasting psychological
instability, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.
People who either lost family members or themselves suffered from
radiation sickness are particularly unstable. The ICRC warns that in
general, "The effects of nuclear weapons on the populations of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki who were exposed to radiation produced a massive medical
caseload that was difficult to treat before the rebuilding of the health
infrastructure in post-war Japan." Many nations cannot provide necessary
and sufficient aid required in treating large numbers of victims of
nuclear explosions, and neither can the Red Cross. It is unattainable on
the international scope, which markedly increases the dangers of nuclear
weapons. Despite the harrowing consequences of a nuclear explosion and
the grim expectations of post-deployment aid, nuclear weapons continue
to occupy a central position in both domestic and international affairs.
Eight states are currently known to have operational nuclear weapons
capabilities. Of the eight, five---China, the United States, France, the
United Kingdom, and Russia---are recognized as Nuclear-Weapon States
(NWS), a designation that marks the states that are officially
recognized as nuclear weapons holders under the Nonproliferation Treaty
(NPT). NPT legitimates these nations' use and ownership of nuclear
weapons, yet prevents, and in so doing, attempts to limit, the perpetual
creation and spread of nuclear technology and armaments. The other three
states---Pakistan, India, and North Korea---are not officially
recognized; their illegitimate ownership and use of nuclear weapons
makes them highly dangerous to the international world. Between the five
NWS states, China is approximated to have 260 total warheads, and
France, 300. Russia, according to the Arms Control Association, has
"1,735 strategic warheads deployed on 521 ICBMs (intercontinental
ballistic missiles), SLBMs (submarine- launched ballistic missiles), and
strategic bombers" and "roughly 2,700 non-deployed strategic and
deployed and non-deployed tactical warheads. And 3,200 additional
warheads awaiting dismantlement." The UK has roughly 120 strategic
warheads, and of those 120, at most 40 at any given time are deployed at
sea on nuclear ballistic missile submarines (of which it has four). Its
entire stockpile is estimated to be about 215 warheads. The U.S. has
"1,481 strategic nuclear warheads deployed on 741 ICBMs, SLBMs, and
strategic bombers" with "2,570 non-deployed strategic warheads and 500
deployed and non-deployed tactical warheads." As of September 30, 2015,
the United States has 4,571 active and inactive nuclear warheads, and as
of April 2015, about 2,500 warheads, not included in the 4,571, are
awaiting dismantlement. The numbers are relatively high, yet they pale
in comparison to Cold War numbers. According to the ACA, at the
conclusion of the first nonproliferation agreement between the U.S. and
the Soviet Union in 1968, "the nuclear stockpiles of both the United
States and the Soviet Union/Russia numbered in the tens of thousands."
Continuous revivals of arms limitation treaties, which first went into
effect between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. just two years after the NPT,
have significantly reduced the stockpiles of the former bipolar powers.
Their systems today are significantly more modernized, yet they only
"deploy more than 1,500 strategic warheads on several hundred bombers
and missiles." Yet the numbers remain in the higher ranges. As the
United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs noted, about 22,000
nuclear weapons are reported to be in existence today and over 2,000
nuclear tests have been conducted. This is due to the fact that their
very existence, while extremely dangerous, is widely accepted as
imperative for deterrence in the contemporary global security
environment. Deterrence theory follows the notion that the fear of
retaliation dictates the extent to which states will act. Nuclear
weapons are the ultimate source of deterrence. They have the capability
to obliterate cities and cause mass casualties. With such absolutes in a
system (war) characterized by the lack thereof, states are rationally
tasked with true consideration. One miscalculation or misinterpretation
can create a set of consequences that are near impossible to return
from. It is under such conditions that nuclear weapons operate. They are
in some ways the ultimate peacekeepers, as they have the ability to
instill innate fear in their potential targets. That fear, to a certain
extent, is considered valuable in the current security environment. The
emerging security environment, according to a policy released jointly by
the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, is characterized by
states of concern, violent extremists and non-state actors, and major
existing nuclear states outside of NATO. States of concern have or seek
to obtain WMDs and their delivery systems. They do not act within the
norms of the international community. Violent Extremists and Non-State
Actors are organizations outside the state system that use violent means
to achieve goals that are against the values of both the United States
and the Western world. They too seek WMDs and the resources to deliver
these weapons. Major Existing Nuclear States Outside of NATO, like China
and Russia pose a significant threat because they continue to develop
and modernize their nuclear arsenals, yet the trajectory of their
politics is still unknown. Each characteristic of the modern security
environment requires a significant deterrent and, collectively, the need
for deterrence is considerably higher. The United States and the world
cannot realistically uphold their safety against such threats because
the nature of security has fundamentally been altered. Conventional
tactics cannot match even a small nuclear arsenal, as even the
relatively underdeveloped ones have the power to deliver a devastating
blow. This is significant because the United States and the world at
large believed that the end of the Cold War brought about the change
needed in order to provide for peace in the security environment without
the need of weapons of mass destruction. The problem with this thought
process is that, while the Soviet Union and the threat of its arsenal
withered away, the knowledge and innovation accrued during the bipolar
years, and the general instability of the anarchic system, persisted.
Danger, while taking new form, continues today, and is arguably far
worse than that of the Cold War era. Enemies today are no longer simply
other states in the system. With the rise of terrorism in the beginning
of the 21st century, sub-state actors play a significant role in
international security. According to the DoD, their roles are magnified
by the fact that, "Some of the most serious non-state actors receive
support from states that seek to use extremists and non-state actors as
proxies." Such actors include Hezbollah, who is back by Iran and Syria.
Even the Nonproliferation Treaty itself is flawed and potentially
dangerous, as it is incapable of following its own objectives. It lacks
the necessary component of complete international cooperation that
allows for successful implementation. This shortfall also manifests
itself in the actions of the nations who adhere to it, as a number of
the participating states have on occasion violated its terms, with the
United States itself---an important component and advocate---included.
This is because the treaty, at its core, lacks the necessary collective
understanding of the imminence of a nuclear threat. True recognition has
to be embedded within the treaty's framework in order for violations and
persistent belligerence to come to a halt. On the one hand the world
possesses a latent desire to be free of the moral burden that nuclear
capability causes, yet on the other, it is far too underdeveloped in the
international sense for the notion of complete disarmament to be
anything but a goal of the very distant future. [Yet the cruel reality
of the situation is that [without the international system]{.mark}, the
business of [nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration [would never have
existed.]{.mark} [The anarchic nature of the]{.mark} international
[system delineates states' basic desires---security and,]{.mark} for
some, [power. The continuous demands to satisfy]{.mark} those desires in
turn [drive]{.mark} the business of [military development, and]{.mark}
such development is the source of [nuclear capability.]{.mark} [The
cycle perpetuates]{.mark} itself [because states continuously look for
new sources of security and,]{.mark} [in obtaining them, release a form
of danger for other]{.mark} states[,]{.mark} [which]{.mark} then [follow

self-perpetuating cycle [is that]{.mark} because the source is the
international system, it (as well as [its consequences]{.mark}), [cannot
disappear.]{.mark} [The system]{.mark} by its nature will, and in theory
[must, continue its process,]{.mark}]{.underline} which means that
solace must be found in the states themselves. Only through cooperation
and control can the United States and other powers, whether they be
superpowers, great powers, or just states, actively limit their impact
on the world they reside in. Only through controlled production and
distribution as well as international cooperation can the consequences
of human paranoia and belligerence be mitigated.

"[[alliance commitments do n]{.mark}o[t merely 'reveal' existing
interests, they create new ones]{.mark}, by incurring reputation
costs]{.underline}."33 Such [[reputational concerns]{.mark} can [drive
states into wars over trivial interests]{.mark} in peripheral
places]{.underline}. As Jack Levy explains: The [alliance comes to be
perceived as an end in itself, transcending the more concrete national
security interests for which it was initially conceived. [Political
decision makers]{.mark} come to [believe that support for one's allies,
regardless of]{.mark} its [consequences, is essential for]{.mark} their
[national prestige, and that the failure to provide support
would]{.mark} ultimately [result in their diplomatic isolation in a
hostile]{.mark} and threatening [world]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
symbolic significance of an [alliance commitment may also become linked
with public opinion (for example, "national honor") and the domestic
security of elites, thus further increasing the importance of alliance
solidarity]{.underline}. It is for these reasons that the policies and
precipitous actions of secondary states often drag their Great Power
protectors into war.34 This argument reflects a tenet of liberal
institutionalist theory that holds that international institutions can
take on "a life of their own" and shape state behavior by placing
states' reputations for compliance on the line.35 socialization.
[[Alliances]{.mark} also can [shape states' military policies
through]{.mark} processes of **[socialization]{.mark}**. Allies
typically engage in regular meetings, military exercises, and displays
of solidarity, and allied leaders often make public appearances and
support interest groups in each other's societies]{.underline}. Such
social interactions may, over time, [encourage states to adopt each
other's interests and internalize alliance norms, including the norm of
collective defense.]{.underline}36 As Glenn Snyder explains, "[Alliances
[introduce]{.mark} a sense of [obligation]{.mark}" and a "moral
convention that promises should be kept. These normative elements are
enhanced by the solemnity of ceremonies" [and]{.mark} may [cause allies
to "redefine their 'selves']{.mark} so that they embrace at least some
of the partner's interests as their own" and "have a joint interest in
keeping \[the alliance\] alive" [that "]{.mark}may very [well overcome a
divergence of self-regarding interests]{.mark}]{.underline}."37
**[Provocation]{.underline}**. [**[Alliances]{.mark} may [provoke
adversaries and]{.mark}** thereby [foment conflicts that]{.mark}
ultimately [suck in states against their interests]{.mark}. The logic of
this argument stems from the spiral model of conflict, which holds that
**[i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [are]{.mark} often
[characterized by vicious cycles of fear and
aggression]{.mark}**.]{.underline}38 The anarchical nature of the
[international system forces states to make worst-case assumptions about
the motives of others]{.underline}. As a result, [[steps that one state
takes to enhance its security]{.mark}, such as forming or bolstering an
alliance, [may "turn tomorrow's potential adversary into today's certain
one"]{.mark}]{.underline}39 [and "[trigger a spiral of insecurity that
heightens the prospect of war between alliance members and
non-signatories]{.underline}]{.mark}."40 **[Emboldenment.]{.underline}**
Firm [security commitments also may spark conflicts by emboldening
allies to act more aggressively than they otherwise
would]{.underline}.41 As Barry Posen explains, "[U.[S. security
guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [encourage]{.mark} plucky [allies
to challenge]{.mark} more [powerful states, confident that Washington
will save them]{.mark} in the end---a classic case of moral
hazard]{.underline}. [This]{.mark} pheno[menon [has caused the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to incur political costs, antagonizing
powers great and small for no gain and encouraging them to seek
opportunities to provoke the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in
return."42 Such [emboldenment]{.mark} not only [increases the likelihood
of wars against non-allies, but also exacerbates "internal security
dilemmas" among allies that can spiral into wars, such as those between
Greece and Turkey]{.mark}.]{.underline}43

To gain insight into the relationship between networks of alliances and
the incidence of wars, we [model the incentives of countries to attack
each other, to form alliances, and to trade with each
other]{.underline}. We first define a concept of [networks that are
stable against wars from a military point of view, when trade is
ignored]{.underline}. **[We show that [there are no (nonempty) networks
of alliances that are stable]{.mark}, where stability requires that no
country be vulnerable to defeat accounting for offensive and defensive
alliances, and no country wants to add or drop alliances.]{.underline}**
[This instability is suggestive of the shifting alliances and recurring
wars of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries. [Wars]{.mark},
however, have [greatly subsided in parallel with the huge increase of
trade]{.mark}, trends that we discuss in detail below]{.underline}. We
thus enrich the base model [to include international trade, introducing
a concept of a [network of alliances being war-and-trade-stable, which
allows countries to form alliances for either economic or military
considerations]{.mark}]{.underline}. This enables the [existence of
networks of alliances that are stable against conflict and the addition
or deletion of alliances. [Trade]{.mark} helps in two ways: First, it
[provides economic motivations to maintain alliances]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} the resulting denser network has a deterrent effect;
second, it [reduces the incentives of a country to attack trading
partners]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[reduces the potential set of
conflicts and allows for a rich family of stable networks that can
exhibit structures similar to modern trade and alliance
networks]{.underline}]{.mark}. In examining the data, we find that [an
increase in the number of a country's allies correlates with a lower
frequency with which it is attacked, and increasing trade between two
countries correlates with a lower frequency of conflict between
them]{.underline}. We discuss below how the model fits with, and sheds
light on, other data and theories, such as the advent of nuclear
weapons, the Cold War, and the increase in the number of democracies.
Our analysis fits firmly into the "rationalist" tradition based on cost
and benefit analyses, with roots in ref.
[5](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-5).[†](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#fn-8)
To our knowledge, [there are no previous models of conflict that
game-theoretically model networks of alliances between multiple
agents/countries based on costs and benefits of
wars]{.underline}.[‡](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#fn-9)
There are previous models of coalitions in conflict settings (e.g., see
ref. [12](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-12) for a
survey). Here, [network structures add several things to the picture.
Our model examines group conflict (e.g., ref.
[13](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-13)) but enriches it
to admit network structures of alliances and of international
trade]{.underline}. This allows us to [admit patterns that are
consistent with the networks of alliances that are actually observed,
which are far from being partitions, moving the models toward matching
observed patterns of wars, trade, and alliances]{.underline}. Moreover,
as we see below both empirically and theoretically, [the patterns and
number of partners of a given country matter beyond group membership or
overall levels of interaction]{.underline}. Finally, our model
[illuminates the relationships between international trade, stable
network structures, and peace, something not appearing in the previous
literature---because the previous literature that involves international
trade and conflict generally revolves around bilateral reasoning or
focuses on instability and armament (e.g., ref.
[14](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-14)) and does not
address the questions that we address here]{.underline}. The complex
[relationship between trade and conflict is also the subject of an
active empirical literature (e.g., refs.
[15](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-15)[⇓](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-16)[⇓](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-17)[⇓](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-18)--[19](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-19)).
The complex correlations between conflict and trade are illuminated by a
model that provides structure with which to interpret some of the
observations]{.underline}. Marked differences occur between the military
alliances we see in the Alliance Treaty Obligation and Provisions
Project data at different points in
time.[§](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#fn-10) There are two
major changes that we see comparing the period before to that after 1950
(see also [SI
Appendix](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1520970112/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1520970112.sapp.pdf)).
The first major change is that large turnover in alliances, which
constantly shift in the period from 1816 to 1950, drops substantially.
Specifically, [consider an alliance between two countries that is
present in year t, and calculate the frequency with which those two
countries are still allied in year t+5t+5. Doing this for each year from
1816 to 1950, we find the frequency to be 0.695. When doing this for
each year from 1950 to 2003 the frequency becomes 0.949. Thus, there is
an almost one-third chance that any given alliance disappears in the
next 5 years in the pre-WWII period, and then only a 5% chance that any
given alliance at any given time will disappear within the next 5 years
in the post-WWII period]{.underline}. The second major change is that
[the network of alliances greatly densifies. Between 1816 and 1950 a
country had on average 2.525 alliances (SD
3.809).[¶](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#fn-11)During the
period of 1951--2003 this grows by a factor of more than four to 10.523
(SD of 1.918). Thus, there are significantly more alliances per country
in the post-1950 than the pre-1950 period.]{.underline} To summarize, in
the pre-WWII period countries have just a couple of alliances on average
and those alliances rapidly changed; in contrast, in the post-WWII
period countries form on average more than 10 alliances and change much
more rarely. Trends of Wars and Conflicts. [Another trend is that the
number of wars per country has decreased dramatically post-WWII, even
though the number of countries has increased---so there are many more
pairs of countries that could go to war. For example, the average number
of wars per pair of countries per year from 1820 to 1949 was 0.00059,
whereas from 1950 to 2000 it was 0.00006, roughly a 10th of what it was
in the previous period.]{.underline} We see this in [Fig.
1](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#F1) ([SI
Appendix](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1520970112/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1520970112.sapp.pdf)
shows that this is robust across a variety of methods of measurement).
Also, with the exceptions of the anomalous Falklands War, and the Korean
and Vietnam Wars---which had Cold War considerations with major
protagonists on both sides, including nations outside of Korea and
Vietnam---the 24 other Militarized Interstate Disputes (MID) 5s since
1950 involved lesser-developed (lower-trade) countries as the major
protagonist on at least one (and often both) sides of the dispute.
**[Moreover, [major trading partners]{.mark} at the time [do not appear
on opposite sides of the dispute]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Trade and Wars.
[International trade has had two major periods of growth over the last
two centuries]{.underline}. The first was from the 1870s through 1913,
during which world merchandise exports as a percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) grew from 5% to nearly 12%, disrupted by the First World
War, and then picking up again after the Second World War, during which
exports grew from 7% in 1950 to over 25% by 2012. [Putting this trend
together with that of wars, we see that the [decrease in wars is
mirrored by an increase in trade]{.mark}]{.underline} (see [SI
Appendix](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1520970112/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1520970112.sapp.pdf)
for more background on trade and war). [Moreover, tr[ade has become less
concentrated]{.mark}: In the late 19th century most of the world's trade
was concentrated among a small portion of countries, and not all of them
traded extensively with each other**. Trade is [more balanced,
and]{.mark} in our model that [enables conflict-free networks]{.mark},
and such trade has emerged both in scale and scope mostly in the past
six decades**.]{.underline} This answers an important puzzle from the
data: Export levels in 1913 are similar to those in 1973, and yet the
drop in wars occurs from the 1950s onward, and not in the early 20th
century. In this regard, our model below is helpful in suggesting a
different measure to use than export levels. In our analysis, [[conflict
ends up]{.mark} related not simply [to the level of trade]{.mark}, but
the [patterns of trade partnerships]{.mark}. The numbers of trading
partners paint a clearer picture between trade and wars, and a different
pattern than the overall level of trade, which turns out to be
concentrated among a smaller number of countries before WWI. In
particular, as we see in [Table
1](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#T1), the number of trading
partners per country is higher in 1950 than in 1913, and the number
roughly doubles by 1973, depending on which threshold one uses to define
"partner"]{.underline}.[\#](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#fn-12)
These numbers do not imply causation because there are many confounding
variables that make it difficult to test any theory directly.
Nonetheless, this motivates developing a model that predicts which
factors matter and how they relate to each other.

7-3-19"NATO Is Much Stronger Now\': Trump Claims Victory After Tough
Summit" wall-e <https://time.com/5336581/trump-nato-victory-spending/>

[As a contentious North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels
began to wind down on Thursday, President Donald [Trump claimed]{.mark}
[victory]{.mark} [over defense]{.mark} spending [and reaffirmed U.S.
commitment]{.mark} to the alliance]{.underline}. After a week in which
he had insulted allies and questioned the value of NATO,
[[Trump]{.mark}---flanked by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National
Security Adviser John Bolton---[gave a]{.mark}n impromptu news
conference at NATO headquarters Thursday morning before leaving
Brussels. "The [United States commitment to NATO is]{.mark} very
[strong]{.mark}," he said. "I think [NATO is]{.mark} [much stronger
now]{.mark} than it was two days ago."]{.underline} [It was a surprising
statement after two days during which Trump's 'America first' foreign
policy approach had presented a significant challenge for the
organization. [Though NATO allies have squabbled in the past,
Trump]{.mark} seemed to be leaving in his wake not just bruised
feelings, but deeper concerns about the future of the Western alliance
that has served as a bedrock of the international order]{.underline}. At
the press conference Thursday, just days before he plans to meet with
Russian President Vladimir Putin, [he said he hoped he "will be able to
get along with Russia," adding that his NATO allies told him they
agree]{.underline}. "The question \[on\] all sides is not just a
tactical one, that is, how to resolve a disagreement, but a strategic
one," says Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian
studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "That is, are we really
committed to the same goals and to the future of the organization?"
[[After a tense first day, Trump didn't]{.mark} [ease up on the
second]{.mark}. Before arriving a half hour late to the final day of
meetings on Thursday, [Trump tweeted that "the U.S. pays]{.mark} tens of
[Billions]{.mark} of Dollars [too much]{.mark} to subsidize Europe,"
that Germany's oil and gas pipeline with Russia is "not acceptable," and
that allies must not only all reach the 2 percent defense spending
guideline, but double that to 4 percent. [Trump]{.mark} had [kicked off
the]{.mark} NATO [summit]{.mark} at breakfast with the organization's
leader on Wednesday [by accusing Germany of being "totally
controlled]{.mark}" and "captive to Russia"]{.underline} because of a
pipeline deal that would bring gas directly between the two nations.
Hours later, he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met privately and
discussed the pipeline, each reaffirming the partnership between the
U.S. and Germany. But not before Merkel and other top officials in the
German government had publicly fired back at Trump's breakfast diatribe.
Read more: Russia casts a shadow over President Trump's NATO meetings At
the end of the first day, [Trump unsettled allies even more by
questioning the value of the military alliance, which was formed to
counter Soviet aggression during the Cold War. "The problem is Trump
seems to really see no benefit that allies provide the United
States,"]{.underline} says James Goldgeier, visiting senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations. "He seems to look at this as we do
everything for them, and we provide them with benefits, and they just
take advantage of us." Throughout the summit, [[Trump berated]{.mark}
the other [members of NATO for not spending enough]{.mark} on
defense]{.underline}. Going into the week he was pressuring them to
spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense, a
figure that was established in 2002 and reaffirmed in 2014 when the
allies not meeting the target pledged to reach it within a decade. The
figure is non-binding, and the goal was to reach it by 2024, not
immediately. But as experts, including TIME contributor James Stavridis,
a retired U.S. Navy admiral who commanded all NATO forces, note, Trump
"tends to liken the situation to a need to hound golfers for not paying
their dues at the local country club." Over the course of the summit,
Trump upped his demand to 4 percent, a target that is above the United
States' own spending on defense, according to NATO calculations. White
House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said this is not a formal proposal and
that Trump had merely "suggested" this increase. But Trump's Thursday
morning tweet, before meetings on Russian aggression and the war in
Afghanistan, said allies "must" get to 4 percent. Following Trump's
press conference, French President Emmanuel Macron denied that NATO
members had agreed to increase their defense spending past 2 percent.
"There is a communique that was published yesterday. It's very
detailed," Macron said, according to the Associated Press. "It confirms
the goal of 2 percent by 2024. That's all." At the Thursday press
conference, [Trump claimed that his push for a focus on defense spending
had helped make NATO a stronger alliance. "We made a tremendous amount
of progress tod]{.underline}ay," he told reporters. "The additional
money they will be putting up has been really amazing." He said an extra
\$33 billion has been committed by NATO countries other than the U.S.

There are two primary arguments against the Democratic foreign policy
outlined above. [The first involves]{.underline}
**[credibility]{.underline}**. [[If the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[abandons Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the argument

[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of its
commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} to South Korea, the Philippines, and
Japan. Similarly, [if **America**]{.underline} won't fight Russia in
Ukraine, [[neither]{.underline}]{.mark}

in [Latvia](https://www.upi.com/US-Army-tanks-reach-Latvia-Russia-calls-NATO-moves-a-threat/3131486641943/).
During the Vietnam War, [[this logic]{.underline}]{.mark} was dubbed the
"domino theory": If the United States didn't defend Vietnam, its
credibility would collapse and other anti-communist "dominoes" would
soon fall. But [the theory]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Decades of academic

Vietnam it would]{.underline} [not defend West Berlin]{.underline},
because they understood that America cared more about West Berlin than
it cared about South Vietnam, and had a greater capacity to defend it.
Similarly, when predicting whether the United States will defend Japan,
neither Beijing nor Tokyo will look at whether America defends Taiwan.
They will look at whether it is in America's interests, and within
America's power, to defend Japan. **[[Far from bolstering a country's

"There is more respect to be won in the opinion of this world by a

most stubborn pursuit of extravagant or unpromising objectives."

**Perceptions of US credibility don't spill over and are
counterproductive**

Unfortunately, this **[obsession with credibility was
misplaced]{.underline}**. For one thing, [a state's
"**reputation**"]{.underline} [for being tough or reliable]{.underline}
[didn't work the way]{.underline} most foreign-policy [elites thought it
did]{.underline}. [American leaders kept worrying that other states
would question the United States' resolve and capability]{.underline}
[if it ever abandoned an unimportant ally, or lost some minor scrap in
the developing world.]{.underline} But as **[careful
research]{.underline}** by Ted Hopf, Jonathan Mercer, and Daryl Press
[has shown]{.underline}, **[states do not judge the credibility of
commitments in one place by looking at how a country acted somewhere far
away]{.underline}**, [especially when the two situations are quite
different]{.underline}. In fact, when the United States did lose, or
when it chose to cut its losses and liquidate some unpromising position,
[dominos **barely fell**]{.underline} [and its]{.underline}
**[core]{.underline}** strategic **[relations]{.underline}** [remained
**unaffected**]{.underline}. In other words, [how the United States
responds to a challenge in Southeast Asia or sub-Saharan Africa tells
you nothing about how it would or should respond somewhere
else]{.underline}, and other states understood this all along. [When
trying to figure out what the United States is going to do]{.underline},
[other states do not]{.underline} start by [ask]{.underline}ing [what
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[did]{.underline} in some conflict **[on the other side of the
world]{.underline}**. Instead, [they ask whether it is in America's
interest to act in the situation at hand. And guess what? This implies
that U.S. commitments are most credible when the American interest is
obvious to all]{.underline}. I mean, nobody really doubts that the
United States would fight like a tiger to defend its own soil, right?
Exaggerated worries about U.S. credibility had a number of unfortunate
consequences. They encouraged American leaders to act in places that
didn't matter, in order to convince others that it would also act in
places that did. Squandering resources on marginal conflicts undermined
confidence in U.S. protection, however, because it consumed resources
that could have been committed elsewhere and it sometimes made a
war-weary American public even less interested in far-flung foreign
adventures. Ironically, **[misguided efforts to bolster U.S. credibility
may have weakened it]{.underline}** instead. [The **credibility
obsession**]{.underline} also [made it easier for U.S. allies to
**free-ride**]{.underline} (something they were already inclined to do),
[because they could always get Uncle Sucker to take on more burdens by
complaining that they had doubts about American resolve]{.underline}. I
don't blame them for trying this ploy, but I do blame American officials
for falling for it so often. In fact, [had allies been a bit less
confident that the United States was going to protect them]{.underline}
**[no matter what]{.underline}**, these [states might have been willing
to **spend more** on their own defense and been more attentive to
Washington's wishes]{.underline}. [If the goal is retaining U.S.
influence and leverage, **what really matters is whether other states
have confidence in America's judgment**.]{.underline} If they believe
that the United States is good at weighing threats soberly and
rationally, and [if they are convinced that Washington can set clear
priorities and stick to them, then U.S. allies can calibrate their
actions with ours and will be more inclined to follow the U.S.
lead.]{.underline} [If allies and adversaries believe the United States
understands what is going on in key regions and has a clear sense of its
own interests, then they will know that the United States won't be
buffaloed into unwise actions by self-serving allied whining, or
provoked into overreactions by enemies eager to drag us into another
costly quagmire.]{.underline} By contrast, **[if American leaders panic
at every sign of danger]{.underline}** and treat minor problems as
mortal threats, **[then other states will be less inclined to trust
Washington's views]{.underline}** on these matters and be more inclined
to follow their own counsel. When Washington goes to war on the basis of
cooked intelligence, worst-case assumptions, and unsurpassed hubris,
then other countries will be warier the next time we try to get them to
line up alongside us. If the United States keeps throwing soldiers'
lives and billions of dollars into unwinnable conflicts, [confidence in
our political system's ability to make **rational decisions** will
decline even more.]{.underline} [If foreign powers believe U.S. policy
is driven more by domestic politics than by strategic imperatives,
they'll view us with barely veiled contempt and meddle even more in our
porous political system]{.underline}. If foreign leaders pay close
attention to the bluster and balderdash that pass for strategic debate
in official Washington, they'll have reason to wonder if the
self-appointed Leader of the Free World really knows what it is doing.
And of course, when they see a lengthy series of costly screw-ups (Iraq,
Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Ukraine, etc.), they will be more
inclined to think for themselves than to trust Washington's guidance.
What I'm suggesting, in short, is that [successful diplomacy depends
less on endlessly reaffirming our "will" or "resolve," and more on
building confidence in the analytical capacity of the American
foreign-policy community and the judgment]{.underline} of top U.S.
officials. And that's not surprising, either. Diplomacy is mostly about
persuasion; it is ultimately about convincing others to do what we want.
They are more likely to accept our recommendations when we can tell a
truly convincing story, i.e., one that has the merit of being true. And
that means that **[credibility isn't the key to a successful foreign
policy]{.underline}**, especially when it becomes a reflexive tendency
to respond to any and all challenges with threats, bluster, and the use
of force. If America still wants other states to follow our lead, [what
**really matters** is **judgment**]{.underline}: analyzing issues
intelligently, setting clear and sensible priorities, and being willing
to rethink a course of action in response to events. New York Yankees
pitcher Lefty Gomez famously said that it was better to be "lucky than
good." He was probably right, but it's even better to be lucky andsmart.
And both matter more than being mindlessly predictable. Or, to
paraphrase Walt Whitman, a "foolish credibility is the hobgoblin of
small minds."

**Credibility thesis is wrong - lacks empirical support**

**Lanoszka 2015** (Alexander, Stanton Nuclear Security Postdoctoral
Fellow @ MIT, \"The Alliance Politics of Nuclear
Statecraft,\" <http://www.alexlanoszka.com/AlexanderLanoszkaIntro.pdf>)

To be sure, some scholars even dismiss the notion that policy-makers can
manipulate perceptions of credibility. Jonathan Mercer writes that
**[states can never develop a reputation for resolve among their
allies]{.underline}**. [Whatever action they implement that advances the
security interests of another is explained away as rooted in
self-interest rather than on 'being a good ally]{.underline}.'13 In his
study of crisis diplomacy between adversaries, Daryl Press builds on
this skepticism. He argues that [balances of interest and power shape
perceptions of credibility **rather than**]{.underline} past
**[actions]{.underline}**. [It is]{.underline} therefore **[pointless to
pursue policy on the grounds of appearing credible]{.underline}** to
others.14 Not everyone agrees with such assessments of credibility.
Gregory Miller demonstrates how actions can a↵ect credibility and, by
extension, the behavior of allies. However, he relies on evidence drawn
exclusively from before the First World War.15 It is unclear whether and
how credibility matters among allies in the nuclear age. And yet
[pundits and analysts]{.underline} commonly [assume]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to this day
[needs to appear]{.underline} resolved and credible to its allies,
whether in Central Europe or the East China Sea. In light of the
critical literature just mentioned, the validity of these intuitively
appealing arguments is not self-evident. **[We lack an empirical study
that assesses such claims]{.underline}**.

### 1AR: Impact Defense

**NPT prevents nuclear prolif -- other deterrence options are
available**

**Spencer 4/5** \[David Spencer is a contributing writer for the Taiwan
News. Taiwan News began in 1949. It's the first English newspaper in
Taiwan. It serves as a bridge between Taiwanese society and the rest of
the globe. "Taiwan has other deterrence options besides costly and
controversial nuclear weapons." *Taiwan News*, 5 April 2019,
[taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3673904](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3673904).\]

The logic behind the question is a pretty sound one. [**[The
justification for all nuclear powers that continue to hold nuclear
weapons is that they act as a deterrent]{.mark}**. 'Other countries will
not attack us if we have nuclear weapons because of the damage we can
cause them in response,']{.underline} the thinking goes. In his
response, Easton appeared to fall into line behind this logic. [\"[Only
a nation that has completely lost its mind]{.mark} and is suicidal
[is]{.mark} ever [going to invade another nation that is armed with
nuclear weapons]{.mark},"]{.underline} he said. He did not go so far as
to call for Taiwan to be given nuclear weapons right now. But he did say
that "the U.S. needs to \"think much more carefully about deterrence.\"
Easton is absolutely right that the governments of both Taiwan and the
USA need to give greater thought to the question of deterring China from
considering a military invasion of Taiwan. As Easton himself has
postulated, a military invasion of Taiwan would be far from
straightforward and would likely lead to huge numbers of casualties on
both sides if China were to attempt it. This in itself is a deterrence
of sorts but it is unlikely to be sufficient to hold China back forever,
especially given the huge sums they continue to plow into their military
budgets every year. The problems with choosing nuclear So, is nuclear
the way to go? The first problem is how popular such a program would be
at home. There is already a huge movement against the use of nuclear
power in Taiwan. Indeed, until the recent round of referendums, the DPP
government was committed to shutting down all of Taiwan's nuclear power
stations by 2025. In this climate, it seems likely that establishing
Taiwan as a nuclear power would be hugely controversial with a domestic
audience, despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of people would
support greater steps to protect Taiwan from Chinese invasion. There is
also the fact that [Taiwan (as the Republic of China) has ratified [the
**Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons**]{.mark} which
[commits the]{.mark} Taiwanese [government to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons and]{.mark} nuclear weapons
[tech]{.mark}nology.]{.underline} In practice, this Treaty has proved
next to meaningless for many countries, but given Taiwan's delicate
international status, [the question of whether it would be wise for
Taiwan to break its obligations under an international treaty is an
important one.]{.underline} Can Taiwan ever have an 'independent'
nuclear deterrent? There is also the question of independence. A nuclear
deterrent is only really effective if it is truly independent. The
government of a nuclear power must have sole control over the decision
of if and when their nuclear weapons should be used. There was recently
a big public debate in the UK about the merits of renewing their now
aged Trident nuclear missile system. [[One of the strongest arguments
against Trident renewal was that it was **no longer an independent
nuclear deterrent.**]{.mark}]{.underline} While the submarines that
carry the Trident missile system and the nuclear warheads themselves are
made in the UK, the Trident missiles themselves are not. They are made
and maintained in the USA. They are even drawn from a joint missile-pool
at the US Strategic Weapons facility at King's Bay, Georgia. There is,
therefore, a genuine question over whether, if the UK's foreign policy
ever ventured far from that of the USA, the UK's nuclear deterrent would
still be available or would the US simply pull the plug? This
independence is likely to be magnified in the case of Taiwan. [[Were
Taiwan to obtain nuclear weapons, they would]{.mark} almost certainly
[have to be sourced]{.mark}, in full, [from the US]{.mark}A. The
likelihood is therefore that [the US would maintain a]{.mark} large, if
not [total, say over when they could be used]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is
therefore worth asking whether, if push came to shove, [the US would
really give the go-ahead for Taiwan to launch a nuclear attack on
China?]{.underline} Would that course of action ever really be in the
interests of the USA? The huge costs of going nuclear and would it even
work? The other big problem of developing a nuclear deterrent is the
cost. [[Nuclear defense programs cost enormous sums of
money]{.mark}.]{.underline} Looking back again at the British Trident
renewal in 2016, the cost was estimated to be a cool £31 billion
(NT\$1.2 trillion). This was widely acknowledged to be a very
conservative estimate with a £10 billion (NT\$400 billion) contingency
fund available that most experts suggested would, at least, be used in
full. [[Given Taiwan's size and the economic challenges]{.mark} it
faces, [the question of whether this would be]{.mark} a
[sensible]{.mark} use of public funds [is a big
one]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is also worth asking if a nuclear deterrent
would even work against China? Ian Easton said [only a country that has
lost it mind would attack a nuclear power.]{.underline} But Communist
China is hardly a rational nation and the regime has proved time and
time again it has little or no regard for the life of its citizens.
Given what the Chinese Communist Party has staked on its nationalist
'One China' agenda, would they really be put off by the possibility of a
nuclear strike from Taiwan, especially given their vastly superior
nuclear arsenal which Taiwan could never hope to match? Some other
deterrence options Which brings us to the question of what sort of
deterrence Taiwan can develop to put China off the idea of an invasion.
Ian Easton suggested a few possibilities including "conventional
(weapons), economic, political, trade, or other measures." These
solutions are a little vague and it is not immediately apparent how they
would make a significant difference to the CCP\'s thinking. [[The best
deterrent of all would be to develop still closer military ties with the
US]{.mark}A. Inviting US ships to dock in Taiwanese ports, encouraging
the prospect of one or more US military bases on Taiwan, even allowing
the US to build a military base on Taiping Island in the hotly contested
South China Sea region.]{.underline} Such a move would, of course,
hugely antagonize Communist China. But it would also make them think
twice about attacking Taiwan too because such an attack would in effect
be an attack on US troops too. Another deterrent is to make the prospect
of an invasion as unpleasant as possible. While the CCP may not care too
much about the lives of their people, they will care about the negative
PR associated with a long and bloody invasion. [[Taiwan should]{.mark},
therefore, [seek to invest more in its anti-invasion
capabilities]{.mark}, looking to develop internally anything it cannot
buy from overseas. [Anti-aircraft and submarine defense capabilities
should be a top priority]{.mark} and funds have already been committed
in this area.]{.underline} But it should also be seeking to modernize
its troop capabilities as well. An army of people with nothing more than
national service experience isn't going to hold off the PLA for long.
Instead, Taiwan should be looking to develop a large elite unit of
commandos (and reservists) capable of taking a real stand against any
Chinese invasion and then, if defeated, retiring into the mountains to
fight a long and painful guerilla war. The prospect of such an ongoing
conflict will be far from attractive to the CCP and, when put together
with [[the international community opposing the Chinese occupation of
Taiwan, could just be enough of a deterrent to put China
off]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would certainly be a far more affordable
and domestically palatable approach than spending huge sums on a nuclear
weapons program that might never see the light of day.

The volume gives emphasis, then, to the (too often neglected) point that
[\"[coop]{.mark}eration\" [is required to halt an incipient
nuclear-weapons program]{.mark}]{.underline}, and backs it with
convincing evidence. The case evidence is taken to suggest that
[negative assurances helped halt the weapons program in Libya and,
maybe, the retention of nuclear weapons by Ukraine, and that positive
assurances helped halt nuclear proliferation by South Korea, Japan, and
perhaps Sweden]{.underline}. The volume correctly acknowledges, however,
that the effect of assurances is typically \"modest\" rather than
\"decisive\" (p. 6); [\"that [when states are faced with a critical
threat from a third party]{.mark}, negative [assurances seem to fade
into insignificance]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (p. 279); that various
confounding factors mute the effects of assurances(including domestic
politics, broader strategy, and the credibility of actions); and that
profound trade-offs are required when negative assurances are provided
to one conflicting party with positive assurances to another (p. 7). In
some ways, the volume is a model of inquiry. To judge when assurances
might work, the authors employ 13 hypotheses that are drawn from
relevant theoretical literatures. These hypotheses include whether the
assurances are explicit or legally binding; backed by forward-deployed
troops; \"strong enough to overcome cognitive biases\"; \"tailored to
take account of unique features of the target state\'s culture,
decision-making procedures, and leadership concerns\"; and used \"in a
way that alters internal debates in the target in a favorable
direction\" (p. 32). The chapter authors stay on message when evaluating
their respective cases; they conclude by commenting on the validity,
invalidity, or partial validity of the hypotheses, and they supply
testable (inductive) hypotheses when the initial hypotheses prove
deficient. James Wirtz, a proliferation expert, renders the final
judgment about whether the hypotheses have held. That said, Security
Assurances and Nuclear Nonproliferation is not without limitations, as
the authors\--to their credit\--do often recognize. Scholars should take
note of these limitations when seeking to advance this important program
of research. Both the hypotheses and the testing strategy are
problematic in some respects. First, the hypotheses are, at times,
tautological. Because some of the independent variables are not clearly
operationalized, the hypotheses are too easily validated or invalidated
on the basis of whether proliferation did or did not occur in a given
case. This is true, for example, of the hypothesis that effective
assurances must overcome cognitive biases. What exactly are these
biases, and could we know that they are overcome should a country retain
its weapons capabilities? Likewise, the test of whether assurances are
tailored \"to take account of unique features\" appears to come down to
whether assurances actually work. A valid test of the hypothesis
requires a standard for judging the adequacy of tailoring apart from the
value of the dependent variable. Second, the binary dependent
variable\--countries either did or did not pursue nuclear
weapons\--sacrifices some explanatory leverage. What about cases\--like
Iran, perhaps\--of a country choosing to keep its options open by
stopping just short of a nuclear weapons capability or possessing but
not testing a nuclear weapon? Third, the hypotheses are given equal
standing when the independent variables in some of them arguably stand
as necessary or permissive conditions in others. [Although the authors
hypothesize (Hypothesis 1) that \"[assurances are more likely to be
effective when a target state\'s interest in nuclear weapons is driven
to a significant degree by security concerns]{.mark}\" (p. 32), the
remaining hypotheses seem to assume the presence of a security
threat.]{.underline} For that matter, the host of potential causal
factors that the authors identify in their case studies could
conceivably contribute to the outcomes in others. For instance, part of
the story about Libya is that it lacked requisite indigenous nuclear
weapons capabilities, suffered severely under a multilateral embargo,
had a leader who felt vulnerable to the threat of a US-imposed regime
change, and might have seen the United States as a potential ally
against a radical Islamic threat. Might these same variables explain the
workings of the key independent variables in other cases? Fourth, the
hypotheses center narrowly on assurances that relate to nuclear weapons
use, and nonuse, although the authors recognize that [[positive nuclear
weapons assurances are]{.mark} often [used to allay concerns about
conventional threats and that critical negative assurances]{.mark} often
[have nothing to do with nuclear weapons]{.mark}: for example, threats
to regime survival preoccupied Muammar Gadhafi, not a US nuclear strike
on Libya.]{.underline} Fifth, as the authors recognize, seemingly
validated relationships are potentially spurious. [Because [positive
assurances often come with economic and military aid, it **might only
appear that the assurance**]{.mark}, provided by aid, [led a country to
renounce the nuclear option.]{.mark} As the author of the Swedish case
notes, \"[the threat that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [might
withdraw assistance was more important than the promise of new
assistance]{.mark}\" (p. 239).]{.underline} Various issues also arise in
the case studies. First, because authors of a case-by-case analysis tend
to think of their cases in isolation from others, the findings rest
primarily on temporal rather than cross-national variation. Thus, the
author of the Iran case concludes, [\"In the main, the hypotheses
reviewed here are not sustained\.... One cannot help but suspect that
[even if Iran had faced no credible external threat, it still would have
pursued a nuclear program]{.mark}, be it under the Shah or under the
Islamic Republic\"]{.underline} (p. 127). But does not the case provide
strong support for Hypothesis 1, linking the success of assurances to
security concerns? Second, as Knopf acknowledges, the cases betray a
selection bias\--apparently toward failure: They were selected for
success and failure but [\"[all involve countries that were at some
point deemed serious proliferation risks]{.mark}\" (p. 6). Whether or
not that bias is mitigated by the editor\'s purported selection of
cases, as well for the relevance of positive and negative assurances
(and, thus, cases in which assurances might work), the selection
strategy clearly oversamples proliferation. **[The study concludes,
then, that assurances are only moderately effective, although nuclear
weapons status remains relatively rare among contemporary
states.]{.mark}** Implicitly, the analysis downplays the role of
multilateral negative and positive assurances that could sway some
states\--]{.underline}indeed, might reinforce a \"nuclear taboo\" that
dissuades most states\--from acquiring these weapons.

Understanding the reputation for non-use is critical for security
relations in the post-Cold War era. The end of the Cold War has made
superpower deterrence, based on mutual assured destruction, less
salient[, while complex [deterrent relationships involving great
powers]{.mark} and regional powers as well as non-state actors [have
emerged as prominent in official]{.mark} thinking and public
[discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 Since 1991, when faced with regional
challengers seeking weapons of mass destruction, [the United States has
toyed with the idea of using nuclear threats in preventive or
pre-emptive modes. This policy, christened "calculated ambiguity," has
since evolved]{.underline}.5 In 1991, then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
issued the top-secret Nuclear Weapons Employment Policy, which "formally
tasked the military to plan for nuclear operations against nations
capable of developing WMD," resulting in the Single Integrated
Operations Plan 93.6 The Clinton administration widened the use of
nuclear arms against states likely to use chemical and biological
weapons. Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 60 in November
1997, permitting US nuclear strikes in retaliation to chemical or
biological weapons use by enemy states.7 The [George W. [Bush]{.mark}
administration [issued]{.mark} ambitious [new]{.mark} policy
[guidelines]{.mark} that [assigned three purposes to nuclear weapons: to
deter; to pre-empt the use of]{.mark} weapons of mass destruction
([WMD]{.mark}), including chemical and biological weapons; [and to
prevent WMD buildups by additional states]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
last element assumed that deterrence might not work against rogue states
and terrorist organizations and that, therefore, their WMD programs
would have to be destroyed; and this might require nuclear
use]{.underline}.8 For example, in situations where an adversary's
hidden WMD capabilities and facilities are buried in deep bunkers not
vulnerable to conventional strikes, the United States could resort to a
limited nuclear strike. The [Obama administration made some important
changes to this policy, but not to the extent of adopting a no-first-use
policy or accepting the non-nuclear weapon states' long-standing demand
for an unequivocal negative security guarantee]{.underline}. In the 2010
Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) the administration did make explicit that
"the United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and in compliance with their nuclear
non-proliferation obligations."9 [Critics contend that the United States
still continues nuclear planning against regional adversaries and that
it has not yet fully adopted a "sole purpose" policy of nuclear weapons
for deterrence only against a nuclear attack on the United States and
its allies. While considering deterrence against nuclear attack the
"fundamental" purpose of nuclear weapons,10 the [NPR makes it clear that
"the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is ... not prepared]{.mark} at the
present time [to adopt]{.mark} a [universal policy that the 'sole
purpose' of]{.mark} U.S. [nuclear]{.mark} weapon[s is to deter nuclear
attack on the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and our allies and
partners]{.underline}, but will work to establish conditions under which
such a policy could be safely adopted."11 It is uncertain if the
Strategic Command (STRATCOM) has removed several targets, including
those of regional challengers, who are not yet nuclear weapons states.12
[It is also unclear if nuclear retaliation is off the list of options
against chemical and biological attacks by regional adversaries.
Although [the US]{.mark} continues to cut the number of weapons as per
the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) commitments, it has
[embarked on a long-term plan of modernization of nuclear forces]{.mark}
largely [in response to]{.mark} China's and [Russia's
modernization]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 We also have no way to predict
whether or not the next administration will resurrect nuclear weapons as
a key component of its defence strategy by jettisoning some of the
commitments made by the Obama administration. The "usability of nuclear
weapons school" exists among Congressional members, scientists at weapon
laboratories, and military professionals. In sum, [[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has used, and to a large extent still
uses implicitly, [a nuclear threat against non-nuclear
states]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Trade ensures no consequences if alliances dissipate 

**Jackson and Nei 15** (Jackson, M. O., & Nei, S. (2015). Networks of
military alliances, wars, and international trade. Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, 112(50),
15277--15284.doi:10.1073/pnas.1520970112. Matthew Jackson is an Eberle
Professor of Economics at the Stanford Department of Economics. Stephen
Nei is also part of the Stanford Department of Economics.)AP

We provided a model of networks of military alliances and the
interactions of those with international trade. We showed that
[[regardless of military tech]{.mark}nologies [and asymmetries among
countries, **nonempty stable networks fail to exist unless trade
considerations are substantial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, the
network perspective gives us an understanding of how [[trade]{.mark}
might [prevent conflict, by discouraging countries from turning against
their allies]{.mark} and encouraging countries to defend their trade
partners.]{.underline} Although this points to [[trade]{.mark} as [a
necessary condition for stability]{.mark}, whether it is sufficient for
stability depends on size of the costs and benefits of war]{.underline}.
In closing, we comment on several other features of international
relations that are part of the larger picture of interstate war. A
notable change in alliances during the Cold-War period was from a
"multipolar" to a "bipolar" structure, something which has been
extensively discussed in the Cold-War literature (e.g., see ref.
[12](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-12) for references).
[Although this lasted for part of the postwar period, and was
characterized by a stalemate between the Eastern and Western blocs, such
a system of two competing cliques of alliances is only war-stable if
there are sufficient trade benefits between members of a clique, as
shown in our second theorem]{.underline}. Moreover, it is more of a
historical observation than a theory, and it does not account at all for
the continued peace that has ensued over the last several decades. Thus,
this fits well within the scope of the model and does not account for
the overall trend in peace. [Another institutional observation regarding
the post-WWII calm is that [institutions]{.mark} have [allowed for
coordination]{.mark} of countries [onto a peaceful "collective security"
equilibrium where any country disrupting international peace is punished
by all other countries]{.mark}, so that war against one is war against
all]{.underline}. However, as shown by ref.
[34](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-34), [[this
equilibrium is in some sense "weak]{.mark}": It relies heavily upon the
assurance that a country tempted to join an attacking coalition will
refuse and that all countries will follow through on their punishment
commitments, so that far-sighted expectations of off-equilibrium
behavior are correct]{.underline}. Given that [various [small
conflicts]{.mark} since WWII [did not precipitate a global
response]{.mark}, such doubts of some countries' commitment to follow
through on punishments seem
reasonable]{.underline}.[§§§§](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#fn-29)
Although [**[collective security does not seem to explain the lasting
peace]{.mark}**, it nonetheless does suggest an interesting avenue for
extension of our model: taking a repeated games approach to networked
conflict and trade.]{.underline} One more relevant observation regarding
changes in patterns of conflict is the so-called democratic peace:
Democracies rarely go to war with each other. This coupled with a large
growth of democracies might be thought to explain the increase in peace.
[However, once one brings trade back into the picture, it seems that
[much of the democratic peace]{.mark} may be [due to the fact that
well-established democracies]{.mark} tend to be [better-developed and
trade more.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, studies
([38](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-38),
[39](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-39)) indicate that
[[poor democracies are]{.mark} actually [significantly more likely to
fight each other than other countries]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} that [paired
democracy is only significantly correlated with peace when]{.mark} the
[countries involved have high levels of economic development]{.mark},
which is [consistent with trade's playing the major role rather than the
government structure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our model abstracts from
political considerations, which still could be significant, and so this
suggests another avenue for further
extension.[\####](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#fn-31) We
close by noting some additional directions for further research[. One is
that both trade and war have strong relationships with geography (see,
e.g., ref. [42](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-42) as
well as ref. [25](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15277#ref-25), in
which the authors find that from 1945 to 1987 86% of significant
international wars were between neighboring states). Because geography
constrains both the opportunities and benefits from trade and war, it
has ambiguous effects on stability. Nonetheless, it plays an important
role in explaining realized networks of trade and alliances and deserves
further attention. A second direction concerns expanding the scope of
the paper.]{.underline} Although we have focused on interstate war,
there are analogous forces at work in civil wars in which there are
multiple parties involved, as well as other settings in which there may
be multiple groups or factions with competing interests and
possibilities of gainful alliances (e.g., firms in an industry with
possible research collaborations or product tie-ins, or political
parties with possible vote trading). [The broad prediction of [increased
trade interests enabl]{.mark}ing [more cooperative behavior]{.mark}
overall would be interesting to explore more generally.]{.underline}

#### Double bind: Either our arms sales don't ensure their security, or they become truly independent and don't serve American interests in the region

**Exum 6/21** (Andrew Exum, 6-21-2019, \"U.S. Arms Sales to the Gulf
Have Failed,\" Atlantic,
<https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/us-military-support-gulf-all-backwards/592249/>.
[ANDREW EXUM](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/andrew-exum/) is a
contributing editor at The Atlantic. From 2015 to 2016, he was the U.S.
deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy.)

First, let me be impolite but clear[: [Despite spending billions]{.mark}
of dollars [on military]{.mark} hardware, our [Gulf partners do
n]{.mark}o[t have]{.mark} very [good militaries]{.mark}. [They sport
large collections of weapons]{.mark} and equipment---some shiny, some
rusted---[but no]{.mark}t [real capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}
That's why I raise my eyebrows when administration officials cite the
threat posed by Iran as a reason to keep arming these partners over the
objections of Congress: [[In a]{.mark}n actual [war with Iran, we
would]{.mark} likely not [ask our Gulf]{.mark} partners [to]{.mark} do
much more than [stay out of the way]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We do
n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark}, for the most part, [trust their ability]{.mark} to
participate in what would be a very stressful, very challenging, and
highly kinetic conflict]{.underline}. The war in Yemen has been a
humanitarian nightmare, but it has also been illuminating from the
perspective of defense policy. [We can finally see what our various
regional partners---the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Bahrainis, the
Emiratis---can and cannot do]{.underline}. The result has not, for the
most part, been pretty. When I was at the Pentagon in my last job, we
determined that the majority of civilian deaths in Yemen were not caused
by crimes of malice but by crimes of incompetence: [[The
Saudi-]{.mark}led coalition's [air force]{.mark} simply [could
n]{.mark}o[t plan]{.mark} and execute [an]{.mark} independent [air
campaign that]{.mark} either [accomplished]{.mark} its [strategic
objectives]{.mark} or, failing to do that, at least minimized civilian
casualties]{.underline}. The Saudis realized this, early in the
campaign, [and they begged us for more help, which we were reluctant to
give, because we didn't want to own any more of their war in Yemen than
we already did---especially when we had a fight against the Islamic
State on our hands and needed all available resources to
defeat]{.underline} it. Compounding these failures is the fact that our
[Gulf [partners have largely invested in those areas where they
can]{.mark}no[t match the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, and not in
those areas for which the United States could actually use partner
capacity.]{.underline} They have spent a lot of money [building very
expensive air forces, for example, that largely cannot do what their
leaders need them to do]{.underline}. But these countries---whose
economies depend on their ability to move oil and gas to the market by
sea---haven't spent much money at all on naval forces that can patrol
their sea lanes, or minesweepers that can reopen those same sea lanes
through either the Strait of Hormuz or the Bab el-Mandeb. That's why you
are more likely to see a U.S. naval vessel escorting an oil tanker
through the Strait of Hormuz than you are to see a Gulf naval vessel.
[As a U.S. military officer wryly lamented to me on a visit to one Gulf
country, "Out of the three services here, sir, the navy ranks fourth in
terms of priority."]{.underline} But ground forces don't fare much
better. Like naval surface warfare, ground combat and the things one has
to do to be good at it are not sexy. You need to be physically fit
(which involves running a lot), spend a lot of time on the rifle range
(which involves sweating a lot), and rehearse battle drills and other
collective tasks ad nauseam (which involve both running and sweating a
lot). I once spent five months doing all that with a light-infantry
platoon in the heat of the Kuwaiti desert and ... well, it's not always
fun. The sun sucks, the sand sucks, and you're trying to keep a bunch of
teenagers focused in 100-degree heat. I get it. [Getting shot by the
enemy, though, is less fun, and along the border with Yemen, Saudi
ground forces in particular have proved largely incapable of closing
with and engaging the enemy---which is the entire point of possessing
ground-maneuver forces. The failure of Saudi and allied ground forces
has contributed to their overreliance on air forces, which have spent
most of the past few decades practicing air-to-air combat (which they're
still not very good at, if we're not grading on a curve) and were
largely unprepared for what they were asked to do over Yemen---as lots
of Yemeni civilians sadly discovered.]{.underline} The silver lining to
all this bad news is that [[none of our Gulf partners look]{.mark}s
[ready to challenge Israel's]{.mark} qualitative [military]{.mark} edge
anytime soon, [individually or collectively]{.mark}, and we retain some
leverage over our partners so long as they remain reliant on us for
their collective defense]{.underline}. The good news, meanwhile, is that
some of our partners in the region---not many, but some---have developed
real and formidable military capabilities. Our Emirati partners, for
example, are able to conduct truly independent military operations, and
their air forces and special forces are capable of operating alongside
ours. They have done so, in fact, over the past decade---including in
Afghanistan. Indeed, one of the things that's missing from the spate of
recent articles bemoaning the influence of the United Arab Emirates in
Washington is the real value proposition that the Emiratis bring to the
table. The reason U.S. military officers, especially, fall in love with
their Emirati counterparts is because the Emirati crown prince, Mohamed
bin Zayed, has invested in actual capabilities and has military forces
the Americans can treat as peers. Of course, [[the danger of helping
your partners create independent military capabilities is that]{.mark},
if you succeed, [you've helped your partners create independent military
capabilities]{.mark}. [They]{.mark} may [use their]{.mark} newfound
[capabilities]{.mark}---from Yemen to Libya---[in support of strategic
aims that diverge from your own]{.mark}]{.underline}. (In Yemen, our
Emirati friends have discovered something that we ourselves were
reminded of in Iraq and Afghanistan: Operational excellence alone is
often not enough to realize strategic victory.) So why does the current
administration fight so hard to keep arming our partners in the Gulf? I
don't think it's as simple as the need to support the U.S. military
industrial base, though that is a concern I'm sure it has[. Some [U.S.
strategists]{.mark} genuinely [fear that if we do not arm our
partners,]{.mark} our [Russian or Chinese rivals
will]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[They can't cite]{.mark} that [fear to
justify the "emergency" that allows us to continue arming the
Saudis]{.mark} and Emiratis over congressional objections, because [it's
more of a strategic concern, but based on]{.mark} my [conversations
with]{.mark} U.S., Saudi, and Emirati [officials, it's a major driver of
American policy]{.mark}. I'm just not sure that is a good-enough reason.
[Russia and China can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark}, in the near term, [rival the
numbers of personnel we have deployed in the
region]{.mark}.]{.underline} None of our partners is going to call the
Chinese military to save them from the Iranian navy. [So [we
should]{.mark} probably [stop being]{.mark} so [scared of]{.mark} the
Russian or Chinese [bogeymen]{.mark}, no matter how much our partners
might publicly flirt with our rivals. One of the reasons they do that,
after all, is because [their strategic interests diverge from
ours]{.mark}: We want to rebalance our resources toward future security
challenges, while they want to keep as many of our forces tied down in
their region as possible]{.underline}. Going forward, [we can afford to
focus on building our allies' capacity only when we expect to reap a
direct benefit. Especially following large recent sales of aircraft to
Saudi Arabia (F-15s), Kuwait (F-18s), and Qatar (F-15s), we've probably
sold enough advanced fighter aircraft to the regionAllies of
Convenience]{.underline}We need to help our allies build capabilities
that will allow the United States to do less, and that largely means
building up naval forces and integrated air and missile
defenses---another rare bright spot in U.S. capacity-building efforts
(at least until the Gulf militaries all stopped talking to Qatar, home
to the largest U.S. air base in the region). You want to sell weapons to
the Gulf? Fine. But sell them some frigates and air defenses. That's not
going to be easy for two reasons: First, unlike Egypt or Lebanon or
Israel, the Gulf militaries are not the beneficiaries of U.S. largesse
in the form of foreign military financing, a mechanism whereby we give
countries funds to spend on U.S. weapons and training. [The Gulf states
have their own dollars that they can spend as they like, and they don't
have to spend those dollars on U.S. weapons. If we don't sell them a
certain weapon system, they can buy a similar one elsewhere. But they do
so at their own risk. If you buy a bunch of Chinese drones and allow
Chinese engineers to walk around your air bases, it will not be long
before those U.S. aircraft and U.S. military personnel find another
base. And our Gulf partners don't want that. They like keeping us
close]{.underline}. Second, our [Gulf partners have been masterful at
scaring the wits out of successive U.S. administrations, by suggesting
they fear we will abandon them.]{.underline} Condoleezza Rice, for
example, came back from a meeting with the late King Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia in the second term of the George W. Bush administration[, alarmed
by the king's worry the United States was leaving the region---this at a
time in which we had 150,000 troops in Iraq alone.]{.underline} That
fear helped [spark what has now been a decade-long push to sell more
U.S. weapons to our Gulf partners, increasing interoperability and thus
deepening the bilateral ties between our respective militaries. But our
[Gulf partners will always claim we are abandoning the region; even
permanently relocating the XVIII Airborne Corps to Kuwait would not
change that]{.mark}]{.underline}. They did it during the Bush
administration, they did it during the Obama administration, and I bet
they are doing it today, during the Trump administration. That fear is
grounded in a clear-eyed view of our presence in the region. They can
see it makes little sense---not in our current numbers. [[They
know]{.mark}, in their hearts, [that we have bigger priorities
elsewhere]{.mark}]{.underline}. If only our hearts knew the same.

### 1AR: Prolif Good

**Proliferation creates multiple powers---that's inherently
stabilizing**

**Ruggie '18** 10/25/18, John Gerard Ruggie \|\| Ruggie is the Berthold
Beitz Professor in Human Rights and International Affairs at Harvard\'s
Kennedy School of Government. He is also an Affiliated Professor in
International Legal Studies at Harvard Law School. He was an Aciting
Assistant Professor at Berkeley with Ken Waltz \|\| \"The Balance of
Global Public and Private Power: A Tale of Two Worlds \|\|
<https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/programs/cri/files/Waltz%20lecture%202018.pdf>

My way of honoring him today is to briefly summarize his theoretical
framework, and then assess how well it helps us understand shifts in
global balances of power today. In Man, the State, and War, Waltz
argued, elegantly, that the recurrence of war in human history is not
due to flaws in human nature, or to the existence of bad states, but to
the very system within which all states operate. He described that
system as being anarchic. Anarchy does not mean chaos, but the absence
of central rule. 2 In Theory of International Politics, he formalized
and elaborated this systemic view. As he put it: "The relations that
prevail internationally seldom shift rapidly in type or in quality. They
are marked instead by dismaying persistence, a persistence that one must
expect so long as none of the competing units is able to convert the
anarchic international realm into a hierarchical one." The persistence
he had in mind lies in the behavior of states that produces power
balancing, which sometimes works and produces stability, and sometimes
fails, producing war. The Model\-- The basic model is straightforward.
[The condition of [anarchy imposes the logic of self-help]{.mark} on the
units.]{.underline} None is entitled to rule; none is obligated to obey.
Since no one can be counted on to take care of anyone else, [it seems
reasonable to stipulate tha[t everyone will try to put themselves in a
position to be able to take care of themselves.]{.mark}]{.underline} In
Man, the State and War, Waltz used the stag and hare parable as an
illustration. In the stag hunt, five hungry individuals agree to
cooperate in order to trap a stag, but when a hare comes into view one
of the them snags it, satisfying his own hunger while leaving the other
four with nothing but food for thought. Waltz noted that anarchy does
not rule out collaboration. Collaboration is one means by which states
can pursue their interests. What it does mean is that collaboration is
itself conditioned by the competitive environment in which all
exist---as we just saw in the stag hunt. That can make relative gains
calculations by individual units more important than overall gains by
the collectivity. Collaboration remains instrumental. In this way, the
international system is like a market: individualistic in origin and
more or less spontaneously generated as a byproduct of the actions of
its self-regarding units. Like a market, the international system
constrains the range of possibilities for individual states. And just as
we identify the structure of markets by counting firms---monopoly,
duopoly, oligopoly, and so on---according to Waltz we identify the
structure of the 3 international system, and thereby the likelihood of
stability or conflict, by counting the number of powerful states. So,
what does this model imply for the three international orders Waltz
analyzes: the security order, the economic order, and what he called the
management of global problems? Security Order\-- In the security sphere,
states have two means of self-help at their disposal: internal means,
such as increasing their economic and military capabilities, or
developing clever strategies; and external, such as moves to strengthen
their own alliances or weaken opposing alliances. [[As]{.mark} one or
more [states undertake successful measures, others will emulate them or
fall by the wayside.]{.mark} [As others emulate successful measures,
power-balancing ensues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thu[s, [the]{.mark}
[international security]{.mark} [order inevitably is governed by
balance-of-power politics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Those that lack
the capacity to balance will try to bandwagon---join up with a more
powerful actor. This dynamic prevails, Waltz states, "whenever two, and
only two, requirements are met: that the order be anarchic and that it
be populated by units wishing to survive." Short of universal empire,
Waltz concludes that the most stable international security order is
bipolarity---or duopoly. Economic Order On Waltz's account, the
principle of self-help also fundamentally shapes the international
economic order. Domestically, economic specialization and competition
are embedded in a common political and legal framework. This permits an
elaborate division of labor, which benefits not only the individual
units but the collectivity as a whole. Detroit can focus on making cars
and Kansas on growing wheat. Neither feels vulnerable to the other by
doing so. And all benefit from the specialization. Economic
collaboration also takes place at the international level, but there it
is embedded in a competitive political framework. Therefore, the
international division of labor is slight in comparison to the domestic.
4 Indeed, Waltz contends that international economic interdependence "is
always a marginal affair." It is even more so when the international
system is dominated by a few states with large domestic economies.
Managing "Global Problems" By this Waltz refers to what he called the
four p's: pollution, poverty, population, and proliferation. Today, I
suspect, he would fold pollution into climate change. Here is the point:
domestic society is capable of acting in its own behalf. Lacking central
rule, the international system is not. Problems abound at the global
level, but decisions regarding whether and how to respond to them remain
with the self-regarding national units. Thus, the management of global
problems is governed by what Waltz calls the tyranny of small decisions.
To quote him: "A strong sense of peril and doom may lead to a clear
definition of the ends that must be achieved. Their achievement is not
thereby made possible. Necessities do not create opportunities." As a
result, global public goods inevitably are under-supplied even when all
concerned may agree that more are necessary. The only way to break out
of this tyranny of small decisions, in Waltz's model, is to find a
surrogate for government. And the only way that can happen within an
anarchic system is when the number of great powers is smallest. And so
he concludes: "Small is beautiful---and smaller is more beautiful than
small." Understanding Global Transformations Let's step back now and ask
how well Waltz's Theory helps us to understand the multi-layered and
high velocity changes at the global level today, beginning with the
international security order. Security Order Theory of International
Politics was published in 1979. At that time, Waltz believed bipolarity
to be "robust." Indeed, a decade later it turned into a unipolar moment.
What would he make of things today? Knowing Ken, I suspect that he might
agree with Janan Ganesh, a columnist for the Financial Times, who argues
that when you strip away the 5 unique peculiarities of President Trump,
his foreign policy amounts to "the restoration of the US as a selfish
state among selfish states, not an overworked governess with the entire
free world as her mewling wards." Ganesh is highly critical of how
President Trump is going about this, but not about the imputed aim, and
I suspect that Waltz might have agreed on both counts. For example,
Waltz opposed the wars the US has fought in recent decades, beginning
with Vietnam, believing they were unnecessary and fearing they would
weaken, not strengthen, the United States. In the long run a shift in
the global balance of interstate power was inevitable, for reasons that
Theory of International Politics captures. At the end of World War II,
the American economy was booming while everyone else's was shattered.
The US possessed two-thirds of the world's monetary gold and accounted
for one-third of world output. Its military capabilities exceeded others
by orders of magnitude. Even bipolarity came to exist largely because of
Soviet nuclear capabilities, ensuring mutually assured destruction (or
MAD). Of course, Soviet nuclear capabilities still existed when its
empire fragmented and the Soviet Union itself collapsed. But Waltz was
not alone in grappling unsuccessfully with that conundrum. Perhaps
Bismarck's acerbic comment put it best: you can do many things with a
bayonet, but you can't sit on it. [I suspect that [Waltz would]{.mark}
have [been surprised by the rapid rise of China, but]{.mark}
[not]{.mark} so much [by China]{.mark} then [seeking to expand its
sphere of influence in the region and beyond---its naval power in the
S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea, [int]{.mark}o [the Indian
Ocean, around the coast of Africa, and ultimately]{.mark} well [into the
Pacific.]{.mark} And its land-based tentacles not only into Central Asia
but also into the heart of Europe.]{.underline} But I think Waltz would
have been shocked by how much help the West provided China for its rise,
whether through admission to the WTO on relatively favorable terms, or
the vast inflow of Western foreign direct investment---ostensibly on the
assumption that economic liberalization would be followed by greater
democratization, but of course also dazzled 6 by the size of the
prospective market, and by the cheap labor from which to source all
manner of products at low cost. So, bottom line? Waltz is right about
what he described as "the dismaying persistence" of the overall pattern
in international politics, although he missed critical zigs and zags. In
stressing the limits of theory of any kind, Waltz wrote that the
universal law of gravitation cannot explain the wayward path of a
falling leaf. Many things that are happening today might well fit that
falling leaf characterization, including the 2016 US presidential
election. But some of his misses are foundational to the theory. Here is
the most monumental: had Nazi Germany won World War II and become the
hegemonic power instead of the US, I doubt very much that the world
would ever have seen a so-called rules-based liberal international
order, whose decline we lament today. As I've said elsewhere, the
determinative factor in creating and sustaining that order was not
American hegemony, but American hegemony. This includes such factors as
national identity, norms, beliefs, and political culture. They shaped
the actual content of the postwar order---its social purpose, rules, and
rulemaking. But for Waltz, such things had no place in systemic theory.
His focus was limited to statist bipolarity, which provided the form and
some of the dynamics of the postwar security order. Today, internal
political polarization in many Western countries may be as much of a
threat to the postwar order as shifts in international polarities. The
Economic Order I've already noted that Waltz considered international
economic interdependence to be a marginal affair, especially when the
system is dominated by great powers with large domestic economies. He
measured interdependence by the relative size of external vs. internal
national economic activity. For example, in a book chapter entitled "The
Myth of International Interdependence," he showed that international
trade and investment as a proportion of GDP did not reach late 19th
century levels again until well into the 1960s and 1970s. So what's new,
he asked? 7 Well, that was exactly the moment when the most significant
economic transformation in post-war history began. It would be unfair to
criticize Waltz for not foreseeing it. But it is fair to say that there
is nothing in his theoretical framework that would help explain it even
after the fact, other than that the US was one of the major player in
getting it started, and that its enabling conditions involved deliberate
policy choices by states. The ultimate result of this transformation was
the emergence of a global institutional form that is not derivative of
sovereignty, like the UN or the WTO. Nor is it like transnational civil
society, which functions by the grace of governments. This new global
institutional form rests on the foundation of universally recognized
property rights and the private law of contracts. It operates as a
global system of financial transactions and industrial organization, and
at its center is the multinational corporation. Now, Waltz considered
the significance of non-state actors and their spheres of influence
strictly in terms of their institutional substitutability for the state.
If they posed no prospect of supplanting the state, they were of no
interest in the context of his theory. He considered them strictly as
process and, as he put it, "not at all productive" of systemic outcomes.
International financial transactions and companies that operate across
countries have existed literally for ages. But something different began
to emerge in the 1970s and got deeply rooted by the 1990s.
Digitalization and financial engineering amplified that sphere manifold,
and has real-time effects at volumes and velocity never before
experienced, including in the frequency of international financial
crises. Equally foundational shifts have taken place at the nexus of
production and trade. As a result of vast and complex global supply
chains, roughly 80% of global trade today (in terms of gross exports) is
linked to the production networks of multinational corporations, with
trade in intermediate products greater than all other non-oil traded
goods combined. Trade in intermediate products is not "free trade" or
"international" trade as conventionally understood; it is trade among
related parties that crosses borders, parties related through equity
ties or contracts. 8 Looking at some well-known brands, Starbucks
sources from thousands of traders, agents and contract farmers across
the developing world; it manufactures coffee in more than 30 countries;
it sells the stuff in 17,000 retail outlets in over 50 countries. My
iPhone was produced by 785 suppliers in 31 countries. The consumer
products company Unilever has some 70,000 first-tier suppliers, and
through layers of complex contractual ties it procures from 1.5 million
small holder farmers around the globe. As a result, one out of seven
jobs in the world is estimated to be global supply-chain related (one
out of five within the G-20), not counting "informal" and "non-standard"
forms of work. In many cases, the labor rights of those workers are more
directly affected by their multinational supply chain than by their own
government. The same is true for the ability of many individual
countries to move up in the global value chain. Multinationals book
deals in offshore tax havens, of which there are roughly 50 in the world
today, as opposed to a handful a generation or two ago. The rapid
increase is due to what one author describes as "the commercialization
of sovereignty" by states that see this as their comparative advantage.
Tax havens facilitate corporate tax avoidance and transfer pricing.
Former US Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers, once a vigorous advocate
of financial globalization, more recently noted: "This is a significant
problem for the revenue capacity of states and an immense problem for
their capacity to maintain progressive taxation." It has particularly
deleterious effects on developing countries with limited capacity to
track multinationals' tax avoidance and pricing schemes. The supply
chain system of multinationals has not only delocalized commercial
transactions. It has also delocalized related lawmaking and dispute
settlement through a new lex mercatoria and essentially private
international arbitration that is legally enforceable against states.
Yet with rare and limited exception, no body of law covers the entirety
of the multinational itself thanks to the universally recognized
doctrines of separate legal personality of a parent company and its
affiliates coupled with the limited liability of each entity. 9
Political scientists have speculated whether such developments imply the
demise of the state. Spoiler alert: they don't. What it does mean is
that the state system now shares the stage with another global
institutional system, which has created international economic
interdependence of a sort previously unknown. To illustrate, Disney
built a Magic Kingdom in Shanghai. As you can imagine, there was a lot
of back-and-forth negotiation. Disney had to give the government a stake
in the resort and in the management company that runs it. In return, the
Chinese government committed to providing Disney special legal
protections from intellectual property piracy, which remains common in
China, as well as other concessions. In the end, Disney's CEO Robert
Iger described the arrangement as "authentically Disney and distinctly
Chinese." The Disney example illustrates the obvious point that states
possess authority in their dealings with multinationals. But it also
illustrates a second point: the interplay between two different
foundations of global authority. One is rooted in sovereignty, the other
in property rights and the private law of contracts. Neither supplants
the other. They co-exist: "authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese."
The power of each in some measure is constrained by the authority of the
other. Of course China lacks the domestic liberal political culture in
which private property rights and freedom of contract first emerged. Yet
it adheres to this transnational authority structure so as to
participate in and benefit from the global economic order. In fact,
China, now the third largest home base of multinationals, after the US
and EU, actively defends this institution. Just last week, Ecuador-led
negotiations took place in Geneva on a draft treaty to regulate
multinationals under international human rights law. Most OECD countries
boycotted the session. It was left to China to raise countless
substantive and procedural objections to the proposal. This is a
revolution indeed, though not one that Mao---or Waltz--- would have
expected. 10 Managing Global Problems Providing global public goods
clearly is constrained by the tyranny of small decisions, just as Waltz
argued. In 1970, OECD members promised to commit 0.7 percent of their
GDP to foreign aid; only six countries have ever reached that target. As
you would expect, they include the Scandinavians, the Dutch and,
episodically, the UK. The core budgets of the UN and its agencies have
been flat-lined, in real terms, for years. No UN peacekeeping mission in
decades has had adequate capacity in personnel or materiel. The Gates
Foundation spends more money per annum on global public health than the
World Health Organization. Perhaps no instance of the tyranny of small
decisions today is as consequential as the lack of an effective global
response to climate change. Kyoto left out emerging emitters. The
subsequent Paris Agreement rests on national pledges, which are not
legally binding, coupled with a periodic review process, which relies on
national self-reporting. Moreover, even if every country delivered on
what it promised, under the agreement we still would exceed the target
temperature rise of 2˚ C. Private initiatives are no substitute for
effective public policy, but they are assuming a larger role in this
space as the institutions of public governance have become more
dysfunctional. When President Trump withdrew the US from the Paris
Agreement two major domestic coalitions sprang to life: "We're Still
In," and "America's Pledge." They comprise governors, mayors and county
officials, investors, business leaders, environmental groups,
universities, and faith-based organizations. Their mission is to
advocate for and report on sub-national emissions reductions consistent
with Paris goals, and the organizations involved claim to represent a
constituency of more than half of all Americans. For their part, major
individual companies have adopted emission reduction targets for
themselves, and some impose an internal carbon tax on their business
units. 11 There may be even greater potential in a money gusher that is
going into ESG mutual funds and exchange-traded funds---that is,
investment funds that incorporate environmental, social, and governance
criteria. Globally, they now account for more than one quarter of all
assets under management---some \$26 trillion (the US GDP is just shy of
\$20 trillion). These funds first took off like a hockey stick graph
after the 2008 financial crisis, and the stick got much longer after the
election of Donald Trump. The trend was led by institutional investors
like pension funds that have a longer time horizon than the average
investor, and who have recognized that business as usual, whether in
financial markets or government, cannot be counted on to ensure
sustainable returns unless sustainability itself is ensured. It now
includes garden variety mutual funds and fund managers, and has also
moved into private equity. Conclusion Ken Waltz's Theory of
International Politics has nearly 19,000 Google Scholar citations. That
reflects its impact on the field and is well deserved. At the end of the
day, however, it is a sparse theory about a subset of interstate
relations---an important one, to be sure. That laser-like focus made it
a powerful theoretical tool. But it also drew the boundaries of its own
scope in ways that limit its capacity to fully account for global power
shifts today. In the security realm, Waltz's Theory got the essence of
bipolarity right, as well as what he called "the dismaying persistence"
of balance of power politics generally. But the theory encompassed only
the statist form and dynamics of the post-World War II order, not its
liberal, rules-based content. In the economic realm, there is little in
Waltz's formulation of economic interdependence that would help us grasp
the transformation of global markets and firms---which is somewhat
ironic because Waltz drew heavily on microeconomics for his model of
interstate politics. He might point to President Trump's attempted trade
wars as evidence for his argument. But if we look closely we see that
the system of global supply 12 chains is quite difficult to disentangle,
and just trying to do so imposes significant costs on America's own
businesses and consumers. The reason? A new global institutional order
exists side by side with the system of states: "authentically Disney and
distinctly Chinese." Finally, what Waltz described as the tyranny of
small decisions on the part of states clearly has a seriously
deleterious effect on the production of global public goods. The most
significant is our existential encounter with climate change. But while
the private sphere no doubt has caused or contributed to our global
problems, in the face of states not doing enough (or heading in the
wrong direction), the private power system is assuming a greater role in
the attempt to protect its own long-term sustainability. So, what's my
take-away? If we view today's international politics solely through the
lens of interstate relations, then Waltz takes us quite a ways. But if
we view it through the lens of what we might call the broader world
power system, he doesn't take us as far. Waltz's world is inhabited by
states with hard shells whose authority is rooted in sovereignty. But
the broader world power system, as we have seen, includes at least two
other dimensions. First, it has always been shaped by the domestic
social purposes for which state power is deployed. And agreement or
dissension about those purposes within or across major states is itself
a source of systemic stability or instability. Second, the world power
system today includes an institutionalized sphere of private authority
that is rooted in property rights and the private law of contracts.
Enabled by earlier state policy choices, private authority has generated
an international order of its own -- and it has been able to do so
precisely because the state-based power system is anarchic, lacking a
central regulator that could have prevented the global
institutionalization of private power, or that could fully govern it
now. It balances the power of the state system, just as states engage in
balance-of-power politics vis-à-vis one another. The world power system
has become a tale of two worlds.

**There is no reason to keep our nuclear alliances intact- they're
leftovers from a different time and letting allies proliferate isn't
bad**

**Bandow 18** (Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute,
specializing in foreign policy and civil liberties. He worked as special
assistant to President Ronald Reagan and editor of the political
magazine *Inquiry.* "Why America's Allies Should Develop Nuclear
Weapons"
[https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-americas-allies-should-develop-nuclear-weapons
8-09-2018](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-americas-allies-should-develop-nuclear-weapons%208-09-2018))

[Most U.S. [policymakers dismiss]{.mark} the idea of [friendly
proliferation]{.mark} in Asia, though analyst Ira Straus has proposed a
nuclear loan by Washington [to Japan and]{.mark} the [ROK]{.mark}.
Ultimately, [however, there is no reason for the U.S. to remain
entangled in]{.mark} those [nations' defense]{.mark}. [Both are nuclear
capable and could develop their own weapons if they desired.]{.mark}
America should consider shifting --- permanently, not temporarily ---
nuclear as well as conventional defense responsibilities onto its
freeloading allies.]{.underline}Uncle Sam has been profligate with his
nuclear umbrellas. The 28 other NATO members --- including Montenegro,
President Trump's bête noire --- each received one. So did Japan and
South Korea. Australia and Taiwan could also be seen as protected.
Certainly Israel would be had it not developed its own arsenal. Perhaps
Saudi Arabia would get one if Iran developed a bomb. Ukraine probably
thought it had one after yielding its leftover Soviet nukes. [The
presumption is that America's commitments are costless since they will
never be called in. Washington deters the bad guys while preventing the
spread of nuclear weapons. Whatever risk might exist, believes the Blob,
it's vastly exceeded by the dangers of proliferation. Under such
assumptions, no wonder non-proliferation is one of foreign policy's
great sacred cows.]{.underline}The problem with our promises to use
nukes on behalf of other nations is that doing so costs nothing only so
long as deterrence holds. And history is full of conflicts in which
conventional alliances failed to prevent war. World Wars I and II are
prime examples. A nuclear guarantee that failed at deterrence would
force either military action likely to result in destruction on the
American homeland or humiliating retreat and a consequent loss of
credibility and honor. What U.S. cities should be held hostage for
Berlin, Taipei, Podgorica, Tokyo, Warsaw, and Canberra? Only an interest
most compelling could justify taking such a risk. [Yet [Washington has
opened its nuclear umbrellas casually]{.mark}, even thoughtlessly,
without much regard for the consequences. In fact, [most of America's
nuclear guarantees are leftovers]{.mark}, [tied to antiquated alliances
created during a different time]{.mark}. But [for those commitments, the
U.S. would not be a nuclear target]{.mark} of so many opposing regimes.
[Through]{.mark} its [alliances, Washington]{.mark} [has]{.mark}
needlessly [turned itself into an adversary of nuclear]{.mark}-armed
[powers]{.mark}.Hence last year's bizarre nuclear scare involving North
Korea. No serious analyst believed the DPRK planned to start a nuclear
war with America. Nothing suggested that any one of the three Kims who
ruled the North were suicidal. Yet in the event of a conventional war,
Pyongyang could still be tempted to either strike out in desperation or
threaten attacks on civilian targets to halt an allied advance. With
South Korea well able to defend itself, Washington is risking nuclear
attack for no good reason.The dangers are exacerbated by the potential
impact of nuclear guarantees on allied behavior, which can encourage
intransigence and even recklessness. Conventional commitments are
dangerous enough. In the early 2000s, Taiwan's independence-minded Chen
Shui-bian government appeared to provoke Beijing in the belief that the
U.S. would deal with any consequences.]{.underline} In 2008, Georgia's
Mikheil Saakashvili triggered a disastrous conflict with Russia,
bombarding Moscow's troops in the breakaway territory of South Ossetia,
apparently expecting Washington to enter any war on his government's
side.[While [friendly prolif]{.mark}eration could create instability and
encourage competing arms build-ups, it [would also be the most effective
way to constrain China without forcing the U.S. into a military
confrontation]{.mark} over primarily allied interests with what will be
soon a great power, perhaps eventually even a superpower. Enabling more
nuclear states would be unfortunate, but [it]{.mark} still [might be the
best among bad options]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT NATO

**Trump thumps any NATO stability**

**Burns & Lute 4/2 (**Nicholas Burns is a Former Secretary of State for
Public Affairs and Douglas Lute is the former United States Permanent
Representative to the North Atlantic Council), "NATO's Biggest Problem
is Trump", The Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/natos-biggest-problem-is-president-trump/2019/04/02/6991bc9c-5570-11e9-9136-f8e636f1f6df_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0280c8651966

As NATO marks its 70th anniversary this week, this unique, often
unwieldy, 29-member alliance is confronting one of the most difficult
sets of challenges in its history. **[NATO]{.underline}** is still the
world's strongest military alliance. But [its **single greatest danger**
is the absence of **strong**, principled American presidential
leadership for the **first time** in its history. Starting with NATO's
founding father, President Harry S. Truman, each of our presidents has
considered NATO a **vital American interest. President Trump has taken a
dramatically different path.**]{.underline} As former U.S. ambassadors
to NATO, we interviewed alliance leaders past and present for a new
Harvard Belfer Center report: "NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis."
[**Nearly all viewed Trump as NATO's most urgent and difficult problem.
Never before has NATO had a U.S. leader who didn't appear to believe
deeply in NATO itself.** During his first two years in office, **Trump
has questioned NATO's core commitment embedded in Article 5** of the
alliance's founding treaty --- that an attack on one of the allies will
be considered an attack on all. **He has been weak and reactive in
defending NATO against its most aggressive adversary, Russian President
Vladimir Putin. Trump has also been a consistent critic of European
democratic leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, while
publicly supporting anti-democratic populists such as Hungarian Prime
Minister Viktor Orban. Trump is the first president to call the European
Union a "foe," rather than a partner, of the United
States.**]{.underline} Fortunately, the vast majority of Republican and
Democratic leaders in Congress disagree with Trump on NATO's value to
the United States. They should vote to approve the bills working their
way through committees that would reaffirm the United States' commitment
to Article 5 and to require congressional approval should Trump try to
diminish our commitment to NATO --- or to pull the United States out
altogether. Congress would be acting in unison with the public's strong
support for NATO, according to a 2018 poll by the Chicago Council on
Global Affairs. Critics who agree with Trump present three main
arguments for why he is right to question NATO. First, they say NATO's
core job was finished with the end of the Cold War. That ignores,
however, Russia's campaign to destabilize NATO members Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland. It also ignores Putin's attacks on the U.S. and
European elections in 2016-2018, designed to weaken our democracies from
within. Containing Russian power until Putin's Soviet-trained generation
passes from the scene remains a core NATO aim. And, as our report shows,
there are new challenges beyond Russia confronting the alliance.
**[Second, Trump has claimed the allies are "taking advantage of
us."]{.underline}** Low European defense spending is indeed a problem
for NATO's future. Germany, in particular, must do much more. But NATO
allies have produced real growth in defense spending for four
consecutive years, starting with Putin's annexation of Crimea --- a
collective increase of \$87 billion. On this issue, Trump would be smart
to continue to push but while doing so strive to transform himself from
chief critic into the unifying leader NATO desperately needs. A third
criticism is that NATO no longer contributes significantly to
U.S. security in the world. Consider the facts: Canada and the European
allies came to our defense on 9/11 and invoked the Article 5
mutual-defense clause of the treaty. They viewed Osama bin Laden's
attack on the United States as an attack on them as well. NATO allies
went into Afghanistan with us where they and partner nations have
suffered more than 1,000 combat deaths. Most of those countries remain
on the ground with our soldiers to this day. NATO allies have also
fought with us in the successful campaign to defeat the Islamic State
caliphate in Syria and Iraq. They conduct counterterror operations with
us in Africa. The European allies have assumed full responsibility for
peacekeeping in Bosnia and the bulk of the burden in Kosovo. U.S. air
and naval bases in allied countries also bring the United States a
continent closer to contain Russia in Eastern Europe and confront
terrorist threats in the Middle East and South Asia. This is a decisive
advantage for the United States. The reality is that NATO is a net plus
for the United States in political, economic and military terms. In the
decade ahead, the United States will fight two battles with
authoritarian powers China and Russia. The first is a battle of ideas
that will center on Moscow's and Beijing's growing confidence in the
superiority of their own systems. We will need the full weight of our
democratic allies in NATO to repudiate the authoritarian model in this
intensifying global debate just as Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald
Reagan did in the past. NATO allies will also be critical in a battle of
technology, as the West competes with a more assertive China in
artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology. The United
States has a better chance to maintain its qualitative military edge
over China if we enlist the scientific and productive capacity of all
our allies in Europe as well as in the Indo-Pacific. NATO remains the
great power differential between the United States and Russia and China,
which have no real allies of their own. Trump should reflect on a last
reality that all his predecessors understood. The United States would be
far stronger inside NATO as it faces these challenges than it would be
alone. NATO is not just yesterday's story but is indispensable if
Americans want to reach for the elusive goal we have been chasing since
World War II: a secure United States alongside a united, democratic and
peaceful Europe as its closest global partner.

US credibility anyways**

Although [Congress has expressed consistent bipartisan support for
NATO]{.underline} and its cornerstone Article 5 mutual defense
commitment, [congressional hearings on NATO in the 115th and 116th
Congresses have reflected disagreement on the impact President Trump is
having on the alliance]{.underline}. Some in Congress argue that
President Trump's criticism of allied defense spending levels has
spurred recent defense spending increases by NATO members that were not
forthcoming under prior Administrations despite longstanding U.S.
concern. [They point out that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
has acknowledged that President Trump "is having an impact" in securing
\$41 billion of additional defense spending by European allies and
Canada since 2016. **Others in Congress counter that President Trump's
admonition of U.S. allies and his questioning of NATO's utility has
damaged essential relationships and undermined NATO's credibility and
cohesion. They contend that doubts about the U.S. commitment to NATO
could embolden** adversaries, including **Russia, and ultimately weaken
the commitment of other allies** to the alliance. Some analysts argue
that European allies who feel belittled by the U.S. president might be
less likely to support future NATO operations advocated by the United
States. Critics also tend to downplay President Trump's role in securing
recent defense spending increases by NATO allie]{.underline}s. They
argue that Russian aggression in Europe has been a greater factor behind
rising defense budgets, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe.

**No risk of Russia war**

Andrei **Tsygankov 16**, Professor at the Departments of Political
Science and International Relations at San Francisco State University,
PhD from USC, "5 reasons why the threat of a global war involving Russia
is overstated," Feb 19 2016,
http://www.russia-direct.org/opinion/5-reasons-why-threat-great-power-war-involving-russia-overstated

The contemporary discussion of security interactions among major powers
is depressing to participants and observers alike. [Experts and
politicians are warning]{.underline} us [of]{.underline} an increasingly
[**high likelihood of a military conflict -- possibly** a **nuclear**
one -- between Russia]{.underline}, on the one hand, [and the U.S. or
NATO]{.underline}, on the other.¶ [In the West, many argue the dangers
associated with a "resurgent" Russia and]{.underline} vow to defend
themselves from Russian President Vladimir Putin's "aggressive" actions
in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Last month, U.S. Defense
Secretary Ash Carter accused Russia of threatening the world order and
starkly warned: "Make no mistake, the United States will defend our
interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the
positive future it affords us all."¶ The [tensions have been
growing]{.underline} and have become especially high [since
the]{.underline} 2014 [Ukraine crisis]{.underline}. Russian military
flights over the Baltic and Black Sea in response to NATO's active
buildup on Russia's European borders has done little to calm these
fears. The Turkish decision to shoot down a Russian warplane by claiming
violation of its airspace in November 2015 revived the discussion of
Moscow's [possible military conflict with Istanbul and]{.underline}
NATO, of which Turkey is a member. More recently, the hype has been over
the Kremlin's [**alleged preparations to invade** the Baltic
States]{.underline} and the West's need to respond.¶ In Russia, these
threats and discussions are taken seriously, and the responsibility for
these security tensions has been squarely placed on the Western powers.
The frequently repeated charges are that the West and NATO have
encircled Russia with military bases and refused to recognize Moscow's
global interests. Russian media have actively discussed the U.S.
National Security Archive's Cold War documents on a nuclear attack
against Russia and China declassified on Dec. 22, 2015.¶ Last week,
while attending the Munich Security Conference, Prime Minister Dmitry
Medvedev compared the contemporary security environment with the one
that led to the Cuban Missile Crisis and reminded the audience of U.S.
President John F. Kennedy's words that "foreign policy can kill us.\"¶
In the meantime, contradicting Medvedev, Russian experts often bemoan
the fact that the Cold War was far more predictable and less dangerous
than today's multipolar world. What many have initially viewed as a
generally positive transition from the U.S. "diktat" is now presented as
leading toward a great power war.¶ This increasingly apocalyptic mood on
both sides reflects a growing international instability and breakdown of
important communication channels between Russia and the West. Since the
beginning of Ukraine crisis and up until the G20 meeting in Antalya in
December 2015, the two sides have barely interacted. Appalled by
Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for Ukrainian separatists,
Western leaders pursued policies of sanctions and isolation, whereas the
indignant Kremlin has sought to demonstrate its indifference toward such
policies.¶ Only since Antalya have Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama
resumed their attempts to regularly discuss issues of importance.
Western and Russia military, too, severed their contacts although the
two sides have recently begun to coordinate their actions in the Syrian
airspace. The aforementioned [[alarmist views]{.mark} and arguments [are
**misplaced**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[because]{.mark} they underestimate
[the dangers]{.mark} of the Cold War and **[overestimate those of
today's world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.¶ Despite some attempts to present
the Cold War as generally stable, predictable, and peaceful, this is not
the time to feel nostalgic about it. Multiple crises from Berlin to Cuba
and Afghanistan extended across much of the Cold War era. State
propaganda on both sides was reinforced by an intense ideological
confrontation accompanied by drills and necessary preparations for a
nuclear war.¶ The Oscar-nominated film "Bridge of Spies" directed by
Steven Spielberg reproduces some of that hysterical atmosphere in the
United States where the public was mobilized for any actions in support
of the government. In the Soviet Union it was no different. For the
world outside the West and the U.S.S.R., this was not a peaceful, but
rather an increasingly chaotic and violent time -- the conclusion well
documented by scholars of the Third World.¶ Why today\'s world is less
dangerous than the Cold War¶ Today's world, while threatening and
uncertain, is hardly more dangerous than the Cold War, for the following
reasons.¶ First, [whatever the rhetoric, major powers are not inclined
towards risky behavior when their core interests are at stake. This
concerns not only the nuclear superpowers, but also]{.underline}
countries such as [Turkey. The prospect of confronting
Russia\'s]{.underline} overwhelmingly superior [military should give
pause even to]{.underline} someone as hot-tempered as Turkish President
Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline}. Even if Erdogan wanted to pit Russia
against NATO, it wouldn't work.¶ So far, [[NATO has been **careful to
not be drawn in**]{.mark}**to highly provocative actions**,
whether]{.underline} it is by [responding to Russia seizing the
Pristina]{.underline} International [Airport in June 1999, getting
involved on Georgia's side]{.underline} during the military conflict in
August 2008 [or]{.underline} by [providing]{.underline} lethal military
assistance and [support for Ukraine. Unless Russia is the clear and
proven aggressor, NATO is unlikely to]{.underline} support Turkey and
[**begin World War III**.]{.underline}¶ Second, [[Russia **remains a
defensive power**]{.underline} [aware of]{.underline} ]{.mark}[its
[responsibility for]{.mark} maintaining international
[stability]{.mark}. Moscow wants to work with major powers, not against
them]{.underline}. Its insistence on Western recognition of Russia's
interests must not be construed as a drive to destroy the foundations of
the international order, such as sovereignty, multilateralism, and arms
control.¶ Third, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has]{.mark} important [interests
to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[prevent regional conflicts from
escalating]{.underline} or becoming trans-regional. Although its
relative military capabilities are not where they were ten years ago,
the [U.S. military and diplomatic resources are sufficient
to]{.underline} **[[restrain]{.mark} key [regional
players]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}in any part of the world. Given
the power rivalry across several regions, [proxy wars are]{.underline}
possible and indeed are [happening, but they are **unlikely to
escalate**]{.underline}.¶ Fourth, unlike the Cold War era, the
contemporary world has no rigid alliance structure. The so-called
Russia-China-Iran axis is hardly more than a figment of the imagination
by American neoconservatives and some Russia conspiracy-minded thinkers.
The world remains a space in which international coalitions overlap and
are mostly formed on an ad hoc basis.¶ Fifth, with the exception of the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Greater Syria (ISIS), there is no
fundamental conflict of values and ideologies. Despite the efforts to
present as incompatible the so-called "traditional" and "Western" values
by Russia or "democracy" to "autocracy" by the United States and Europe,
the world majority does not think that this cultural divide is worth
fighting for.¶ [Despite the dangers]{.underline} of [[the
world]{.underline}]{.mark} we live in, it [[contains]{.mark} a number of
important]{.underline}, even [[**underappreciated**,
checks]{.underline}]{.mark} on great powers' militarism. The [[threat
talk]{.underline}]{.mark} coming from politicians is often deceiving.
Such talk [[may be a way to **pressure the opponent**]{.mark}
into]{.underline} various political and military [concessions rather
than to signal real intentions. When such pressures do not bring
expected results]{.underline}, the [rhetoric of war]{.underline} and
isolation [subsides]{.underline}.¶ **[Then a [dialogue
begins]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Perhaps, the [**increasing** frequency of
**[exchanges between Obama and Putin]{.mark}**]{.underline} since
December 2015 - [including]{.underline} their recent [phone conversation
following the Munich conference -]{.underline}
[[suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} a growing [[recognition]{.mark} that the
record of pressuring]{.underline} Russia [has been mixed at
best.]{.underline}

**No Russia war**

**Trenin 18** ― Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center,
Ph.D. from the Institute of the USA and Canada, Russian Academy of
Sciences, Chair of the Foreign and Security Policy Program at the
Carnegie Center, 2018. ("Fears of World War III are overblown",

Accessed 11-13-2018)

[As for Russia's own intentions, two things are clear. [There is **no
interest** in Moscow in attacking the Baltic states]{.mark} or
Poland]{.underline}. These countries are as safe now as they were before
2014. Suggestions otherwise simply point to the deep wounds in both
nations' psyche, which will not be healed for many decades.

Should Ukraine's leaders decide to repeat Mikheil Saakashvili's mistake
in 2008 and launch a major offensive to retake Donbas --- however
unlikely --- the Russian response could indeed be devastating and lead
to Ukraine's loss of sovereignty, as Putin recently stated. But [does
this mean Russia will move on Ukraine unprovoked? **Most certainly
not.**]{.underline}

[[Putin's main concerns are]{.mark} largely [domestic. He has an
ambitious program]{.mark} that logically calls [for]{.mark} more
[economic ties with the West]{.mark}. To move forward, he is looking [to
**ease tensions with the EU and the U.S**.]{.mark} What Putin wanted to
get out of Helsinki was mainly to **start a dialogue** with
Washington.]{.underline}

Those hopes are now visibly going up in smoke. It is safe to bet that
Russia will continue to face the same opposition from a coalition of
U.S. and EU interests.

The first détente in the hybrid war between Russia and the West was
indeed nipped in the bud by Trump's behavior and the vehemence of his
domestic critics. So be it.

[[Moscow will]{.mark} not capitulate]{.underline}, and will indeed
[[push back]{.mark}. But it's **[not]{.mark} likely** to take the [form
of a]{.mark}n aggressive, overt [military attack. Fears of new wars are
**far from accurate**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT Japan

**Anti-nuclear sentiments prevent prolif -- even slight hesitations are
[ephemeral]{.underline} -- look to Japan**

**Tatsumi 12** \[Yuki Tatsumi is a Senior Fellow and Co-Director of the
East Asia Program and Director of the Japan Program at the Stimson
Center. She also worked for the Center for Strategic and International
Studies at the Embassy of Japan. This excerpt comes from Chapter 7 of
Knopf's book titled *Security Assurances and Nuclear Nonproliferation*.
"Maintaining Japan\'s Non-Nuclear Identity: The Role of U.S. Security
Assurances." *Stimson*, 4 July 2012,
[stimson.org/content/maintaining-japans-non-nuclear-identity-role-us-security-assurances](https://www.stimson.org/content/maintaining-japans-non-nuclear-identity-role-us-security-assurances)\]

**[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** has a unique profile among the
non-nuclear weapon states in the world: it [[**voluntarily renounced the
possession of nuclear weapons** despite having]{.mark} one of
[the]{.mark} world's most advanced civil nuclear energy programs and the
technological [capacity to become a nuclear-armed
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [Japan's renunciation of nuclear
weapons is also a part of its post-World War II national
identity]{.underline}, an identity that still shapes Japan's self-image
today. Since the 1990s, however, [[rising tensions on the Korean
peninsula]{.mark} over North Korea's nuclear program [have prompted
debate]{.mark} within Japan [regarding its decades-old non-nuclear
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. While there is little sign that Japan will
abandon this policy in the near future, frequently expressed concerns
about Japan's joining the nuclear club make it important to consider
what contributed to Japan's decision to forswear nuclear weapons and
[the role [security assurances have played in bringing about]{.mark} and
maintaining [this decision]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Japan, the most
important assurance has been **[[a U.S. security guarantee in the form
of a bilateral alliance and extended nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Given the considerable impact that
the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident has had on the
Japanese public's attitude toward nuclear power, [[antinuclear sentiment
seems to have regained strength in Japan since the]{.mark} March 2011
[earthquake and tsunami triggered widespread damage and radiation
releases at the four power stations in Fukushima]{.mark}
Dai-ichi]{.underline}. Still, given that Japan continues to face nuclear
weapon threats in its neighborhood, the question of whether Japan might
go nuclear remains important. This chapter proceeds in four sections.
First, it traces the evolution of Japan's non-nuclear policy since 1945.
Second, it describes the security assurances that have been offered to
Japan and the role that those assurances have played in Japan's decision
to renounce nuclear weapons and maintain this decision. In this context,
it reviews past debates within Japan on a nuclear option. Third, it
discusses how different security assurance hypotheses may be applicable
to explain Japan's behavior. The chapter ends by exploring the key
factors likely to shape future debates in Japan on the possession of
nuclear weapons, including how perceptions of the reliability of U.S.
security assurances may affect those debates. The chapter concludes that
[Japan's non-nuclear weapon status has multiple causes. [In addition to
the positive security assurance from the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,
[Tokyo's recognition of]{.mark} the negative [regional security
implications of going nuclear and domestic antinuclear sentiment have
also been important.]{.mark} This suggests that [a future weakening of
the U.S. security guarantee might not automatically lead Japan to
reconsider its decision]{.mark}. Yet attention to the credibility of the
security assurance still remains a prudent nonproliferation
investment]{.underline}.
