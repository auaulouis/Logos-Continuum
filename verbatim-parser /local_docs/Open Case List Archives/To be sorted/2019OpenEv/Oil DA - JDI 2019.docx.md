#### Arms sales define the relationship in the status quo 

**Dewan, 2018**

(Angela -- news producer with CNN International who focuses on Russia,
Syria, Brexit, and democracy, "These are the countries still selling
arms to Saudi Arabia," CNN, 23 Nov. 2018,
<https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/22/middleeast/arms-exports-saudi-arabia-intl/index.html>)

Despite these decreases, **[the overall value of Saudi weapons imports
actually increased by 38% between 2016 and 2017.]{.underline}** That was
almost **[entirely because of a huge uptick in transfers from the United
States,]{.underline}** which almost doubled its exports in terms of
value from \$1.8 billion to \$3.4 billion in that time. Germany also
multiplied its exports from \$14 million to \$105 million, although it
is expected to be much lower this year following its suspension.
Overall, **[no country comes close to the United States in major weapons
supply. Over the past five years, for example, the US accounted for 61%
of major arms sales to the Saudis]{.underline}**. The UK was a distant
second, with a 23% share, while France, in third place, was a mere 4%.
In a statement on Tuesday, **[Trump said that]{.underline}**
[**[canceling major arms contracts with the Saudis would be
foolish,]{.underline}**](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/20/politics/trump-statement-saudi-khashoggi/index.html)
and that \"Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries\" if the
US halted its sales.

#### Saudi Arabia retaliates to the plan with oil shocks that reverberate globally 

**Davies, 2018**

(Rob, "How much damage can Saudi Arabia do to the global economy?," The
Guardian, 15 Oct. 2018,
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/15/how-much-damage-can-saudi-arabia-do-to-the-global-economy>)

**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** enjoys a privileged position both in
geopolitical and economic terms. It **[will have a powerful hand to play
if tensions with the US]{.underline}** and the west **[escalate and
it]{.underline}** [**[follows through with]{.underline}** Sunday's
warning of
**[retaliation]{.underline}**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/14/jamal-khashoggi-turkey-looks-to-uk-to-persuade-saudi-arabia-to-cooperate).
Its vast **[oil]{.underline}** reserves -- it claims to have about 260bn
barrels still to extract **[-- afford the]{.underline}** most obvious
**[advantage. The kingdom is the world's largest oil exporter, pumping
or shipping]{.underline}** about **[7m barrels a day, and giving Riyadh
[huge clout in the global
economy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/trump-saudi-arabia-oil-production-iran-venezuela)
because it wields power to push up prices]{.underline}**. An editorial
in Arab News by Turki Aldhakhil, the general manager of the official
Saudi news channel, Al Arabiya, offers a hint of what could be in the
offing. He said **[Riyadh was weighing]{.underline}** up **[30
measures]{.underline}** designed **[to put pressure on the US if it were
to impose sanctions]{.underline}** over the disappearance and presumed
murder of Jamal Khashoggi inside the country's Istanbul consulate.
**[These would include an oil production cut that could drive prices
from around \$80]{.underline}** (£60) a barrel **[to more than
\$400]{.underline}**, more than **[double the]{.underline}**
[**[all-time high]{.underline}**
of\$147.27](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/12/oil.commodities)
reached **[in 2008]{.underline}**. **[This would have profound
consequences globally]{.underline}**, not just because motorists would
pay more at the petrol pump, but because **[it would force up the cost
of all goods]{.underline}** that travel by road. **[Saudi Arabia also
supports thousands of US jobs via its arms purchases]{.underline}**. It
is the [world's second-largest arms importer after
India](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/nearly-half-of-us-arms-exports-go-to-the-middle-east)
and 61% of those imports come from the US**[. It was the US's biggest
arms customer last year, signing \$17.5bn worth of deals]{.underline}**,
a trend that looks set to continue after Donald Trump [signed a \$110bn
defence agreement in
Riyadh](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/12/us-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-donald-trump-visit)
last year. The alliance stands **[to benefit]{.underline}** US
**[employers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Electric and
ExxonMobil.]{.underline}** Some of the firms are reported to have
expressed concern to Trump already about the impact that a freeze in
Saudi-US relations might have. **[Riyadh could]{.underline}**, for
example, **[simply switch its purchases to other major arms
exporters]{.underline}** such as Russia and China.

#### The impact is terrorism and global wars -- oil is *[the thing]{.underline}* countries start wars and escalate over

**Klare, 2014**

(Michael T. -professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire
College," Twenty-first century energy wars: how oil and gas are fuelling
global conflicts, Energy Post, 15 July 2014,
<https://energypost.eu/twenty-first-century-energy-wars-oil-gas-fuelling-global-conflicts/>)

**[Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, Ukraine, the East and South China
Seas:]{.underline}** wherever you look, **[the world is aflame with new
or intensifying conflicts.]{.underline}** At first glance, these
upheavals appear to be independent events, driven by their own unique
and idiosyncratic circumstances. But look more closely and they share
several key characteristics -- notably, a witch's brew of ethnic,
religious, and national **[antagonisms]{.underline}** that have **[been
stirred to the boiling point by a fixation on energy]{.underline}**. In
each of these conflicts, the fighting is driven in large part by the
eruption of long-standing historic antagonisms among neighboring (often
intermingled) tribes, sects, and peoples. In Iraq and Syria, it is a
clash among Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, Turkmen, and others; in Nigeria,
among Muslims, Christians, and assorted tribal groupings; in South
Sudan, between the Dinka and Nuer; in Ukraine, between Ukrainian
loyalists and Russian-speakers aligned with Moscow; in the East and
South China Sea, among the Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipinos, and
others. **[It would be easy to attribute all this to age-old
hatreds]{.underline}**, as suggested by many analysts;
**[but]{.underline}** while such hostilities do help drive these
conflicts, **[they are fueled by]{.underline}** a most modern impulse as
well: the desire to control valuable **[oil]{.underline}** and natural
gas assets. Make no mistake about it: **[these are twenty-first-century
energy wars.]{.underline}** It should surprise no one that energy plays
such a significant role in these conflicts. **[Oil and gas
are]{.underline}**, after all, **[the world's most]{.underline}**
important and **[valuable commodities and constitute a major source of
income for the governments and corporations that control their
production and distribution]{.underline}**. Indeed, the governments of
[Iraq](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=IZ),
[Nigeria](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=NI),
[Russia](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=RS), [South
Sudan](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=SU), and
[Syria](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=SY)derive the great
bulk of their revenues from oil sales, while the major energy firms
(many state-owned) exercise immense power in these and the other
countries involved. Whoever controls these states, or the oil- and
gas-producing areas within them, also controls the collection and
allocation of crucial revenues. Despite the patina of historical
enmities, many of these conflicts, then, are really struggles for
control over the principal source of national income. Moreover, **[we
live in an [energy-centric
world](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175487/) where control over
oil]{.underline}** and gas resources (and their means of delivery**[)
translates into geopolitical clout for some and economic vulnerability
for others. Because so many countries are dependent on energy imports,
nations with surpluses to export]{.underline}** -- including Iraq,
Nigeria, Russia, and South Sudan -- often **[exercise disproportionate
influence]{.underline}** on the world stage. What happens in these
countries sometimes matters as much to the rest of us as to the people
living in them, and **[so the risk of external involvement in their
conflicts]{.underline}** -- whether in the form of direct
**[intervention, arms transfers]{.underline}**, the sending in of
**[military advisers]{.underline}**, or economic assistance -- **[is
greater]{.underline}** than almost anywhere else. The struggle over
energy resources has been a conspicuous factor in many recent conflicts,
including the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988, the Gulf War of 1990-1991, and
the Sudanese Civil War of 1983-2005. On first glance, the fossil-fuel
factor in the most recent outbreaks of tension and fighting may seem
less evident. But look more closely and you'll see that each of these
conflicts is, at heart, an energy war. Iraq, Syria, and ISIS The Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria
([**[ISIS]{.underline}**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24179084)),
the Sunni extremist group that controls large chunks of western Syria
and northern Iraq, is a well-armed militia intent on creating an Islamic
caliphate in the areas it controls. In some respects, it is a fanatical,
sectarian religious organization, seeking to reproduce the pure,
uncorrupted piety of the early Islamic era. At the same time, it **[is
engaged in a]{.underline}** conventional **[[nation-building
project](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/world/middleeast/rebels-fast-strike-in-iraq-was-years-in-the-making.html),]{.underline}**
seeking to create a fully functioning state with all its attributes. As
the United States learned to its dismay in Iraq and Afghanistan,
**[nation-building is expensive]{.underline}**: institutions must be
created and financed, armies recruited and paid, weapons and fuel
procured, and infrastructure maintained. **[Without oil]{.underline}**
(or some other lucrative source of income), **[ISIS could
never]{.underline}** hope to a**[ccomplish its]{.underline}** ambitious
**[goals]{.underline}**. However, as it now occupies key oil-producing
areas of Syria and oil-refining facilities in Iraq, it is in a unique
position to do so. **[Oil]{.underline}**, then, **[is absolutely
essential to the organization]{.underline}**'s grand strategy. Without
oil, ISIS could never hope to accomplish its ambitious goals. Syria was
never a major oil producer, but its pre-war production of some [400,000
barrels](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=SY) per day
did provide the regime of Bashar al-Assad with a major source of income.
Now, **[most of the country's oil fields are under the control
of]{.underline}** rebel groups, including **[ISIS]{.underline}**, the
al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and local Kurdish militias. Although
production from the fields has dropped significantly, enough is being
extracted and sold through various clandestine channels to [provide the
rebels](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/world/middleeast/rebels-in-syria-claim-control-of-resources.html)
with income and operating funds. "Syria is an oil country and has
resources, but in the past they were all stolen by the regime,"
[said](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/world/middleeast/rebels-in-syria-claim-control-of-resources.html)
Abu Nizar, an anti-government activist. "Now they are being stolen by
those who are profiting from the revolution." At first, many rebel
groups were
[involved](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/middleeast/syrias-oil-a-source-of-contention-for-competing-groups.htm)
in these extractive activities, but since January, when it assumed
control of [Raqqa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raqqa), the capital of
the province of that name, ISIS has been the dominant player in the oil
fields. In addition, it has seized fields in neighboring Deir al-Zour
Province along the Iraq border. Indeed, many of the U.S.-supplied
weapons it acquired from the fleeing Iraqi army after its recent drive
into Mosul and other northern Iraqi cities have been [moved
into](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/isis-iraq-syria-two-wars-one-nightmare)
Deir al-Zour to help in the organization's campaign to take full control
of the region. In Iraq, ISIS is fighting to gain control over Iraq's
largest refinery at
[Baiji](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27917824) in the
central part of the country. It appears that ISIS [sells
oil](http://www.syriadirect.org/main/36-interviews/1114-oil-sales-fuel-rebel-groups-in-eastern-syria)
from the fields it controls to shadowy middlemen who in turn arrange for
its transport -- mostly by tanker trucks -- to buyers in Iraq, Syria,
and Turkey. These sales are [said to
provide](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/21/world/middleeast/isis-iraq-insurgents-reaping-wealth-as-they-advance.html)
the organization with the funds needed to pay its troops and acquire its
vast stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Many observers also claim that
ISIS is selling oil to the Assad regime in return for immunity from
government air strikes of the sort being launched against other rebel
groups. "Many locals in Raqqa accuse ISIS of collaborating with the
Syrian regime," a Kurdish journalist, Sirwan Kajjo,
[reported](http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/06/03/fight-for-raqqa/hcgh)
in early June. "Locals say that while other rebel groups in Raqqa have
been under attack by regime air strikes on a regular basis, ISIS
headquarters have not once been attacked." However the present fighting
in northern Iraq plays out, it is obvious that there, too, oil is a
central factor. ISIS seeks both to deny petroleum supplies and oil
revenue to the Baghdad government and to bolster its own coffers,
enhancing its capacity for nation-building and further military
advances. At the same time, the Kurds and various Sunni tribes --- some
allied with ISIS --- want control over oil fields located in the areas
under their control and a [greater
share](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175860/) of the nation's oil
wealth. Ukraine, the Crimea, and Russia The present crisis in Ukraine
[began](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/middleeast/syrias-oil-a-source-of-contention-for-competing-groups.html)
in November 2013 when President [Viktor
Yanukovych](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanukovych) repudiated an
agreement for closer economic and political ties with the European Union
(EU), opting instead for closer ties with Russia. That act touched off
fierce [anti-government
protests](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25182823) in Kiev and
eventually led to Yanukovych's flight from the capital. With Moscow's
principal ally pushed from the scene and pro-EU forces in control of the
capital, Russian President Vladimir **[Putin moved to seize control of
the Crimea and foment a separatist drive in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}**. For both sides, **[the]{.underline}** resulting
**[struggle has been about]{.underline}** political legitimacy and
national identity -- but as in other recent conflicts, it has also been
about **[energy]{.underline}**. **[By annexing the Crimea, Russia
virtually doubled the offshore territory it controls in the Black Sea,
which is thought to house billions of barrels of oil]{.underline}** and
vast reserves of natural gas. **[Ukraine is]{.underline}** not itself a
significant energy producer. It is, however, **[a [major transit
route](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=UP)]{.underline}**
for the delivery of Russian natural gas to Europe. According to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration (EIA), Europe
[obtained](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15411) 30% of
its gas from Russia in 2013 -- most of it from the state-controlled gas
giant [Gazprom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazprom) -- and
approximately half of this was transported by pipelines crossing
Ukraine. As a result, that country plays a critical role in the [complex
energy
relationship](https://csis.org/publication/russia-eu-gas-relationship-partnership-necessity)
between Europe and Russia, one that has proved incredibly lucrative for
the shadowy elites and oligarchs who control the flow of gas, while at
the same time provoking intense controversy.
[Disputes](http://www.cfr.org/ukraine/business-politics-behind-russia-ukraine-gas-dispute/p18178)
over the price Ukraine pays for its own imports of Russian gas twice
provoked a cut-off in deliveries by Gazprom, leading to diminished
supplies in Europe as well. Given this background, it is not surprising
that a key objective of the "[association
agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93European_Union_Association_Agreement)"
between the EU and Ukraine that was repudiated by Yanukovych (and has
now been signed by the new Ukrainian government) calls for the extension
of EU energy rules to Ukraine's energy system -- essentially eliminating
the cozy deals between Ukrainian elites and Gazprom. By entering into
the agreement, EU officials
[claim](http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/ukraine/eu_ukraine/association_agreement/index_en.htm),
Ukraine will begin "a process of approximating its energy legislation to
the EU norms and standards, thus facilitating internal market reforms."
Russian leaders have many reasons to despise the association agreement.
For one thing, it will move Ukraine, a country on its border, into a
closer political and economic embrace with the West. Of special concern,
however, are the provisions about energy, given Russia's economic
reliance on gas sales to Europe -- not to mention the threat they pose
to the personal fortunes of well-connected Russian elites. In late 2013
Yanukovych came [under immense
pressure](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraine-under-pressure-from-russia-puts-brakes-on-eu-deal/2013/11/21/46c50796-52c9-11e3-9ee6-2580086d8254_story.html)
from Vladimir Putin to turn his back on the EU and agree instead to an
economic union with Russia and Belarus, an arrangement that would have
protected the privileged status of elites in both countries. However, by
moving in this direction, Yanukovych put a bright spotlight on the
[crony
politics](http://csis.org/blog/russia%E2%80%99s-gas-clash-ukraine-geopolitics-or-just-money)
that had long plagued Ukraine's energy system, thereby triggering
protests in Kiev's Independence Square (the
[Maidan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan)) -- that led to his
downfall. Once the protests began, a cascade of events led to the
current standoff, with the Crimea in Russian hands, large parts of the
east under the control of pro-Russian separatists, and the rump western
areas moving ever closer to the EU. In this ongoing struggle, identity
politics has come to play a prominent role, with leaders on all sides
appealing to national and ethnic loyalties. **[Energy]{.underline}**,
nevertheless, **[remains a major factor]{.underline}** in the equation.
**[Gazprom has repeatedly [raised the
price](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/world/europe/russia-ratchets-up-ukraines-gas-bills-in-shift-to-an-economic-battlefield.html)
it charges Ukraine for its imp]{.underline}**orts of natural gas, and on
June 16th [cut
off](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/world/europe/russia-gazprom-increases-pressure-on-ukraine-in-gas-dispute.html)
its supply entirely, claiming non-payment for past deliveries. A day
later, an explosion
[damaged](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27891018) one of the main
pipelines carrying Russian gas to Ukraine -- an event still being
investigated. Negotiations over the gas price remain a major issue in
the ongoing negotiations between Ukraine's newly elected president,
Petro Poroshenko, and Vladimir Putin. Energy also played a key role in
Russia's determination to take the Crimea by military means. By annexing
that region, Russia virtually
[doubled](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/world/europe/in-taking-crimea-putin-gains-a-sea-of-fuel-reserves.html)
the offshore territory it controls in the Black Sea, which is thought to
house billions of barrels of oil and vast reserves of natural gas. Prior
to the crisis, several Western oil firms, including ExxonMobil, were
[negotiating](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/shifting-energy-trends-blunt-russias-natural-gas-weapon/2014/02/28/7d090062-9ef7-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html)
with Ukraine for access to those reserves. Now, they will be negotiating
with Moscow. "It's a big deal,"
[said](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/world/europe/in-taking-crimea-putin-gains-a-sea-of-fuel-reserves.html)Carol
Saivetz, a Eurasian expert at MIT. "It deprives Ukraine of the
possibility of developing these resources and gives them to Russia."
Nigeria and South Sudan **[The conflicts in South Sudan and
Nigeria]{.underline}** are distinctive in many respects, yet both
**[share]{.underline}** a key common factor: widespread anger and
distrust towards **[government officials who have become]{.underline}**
wealthy, corrupt, and autocratic **[thanks to]{.underline}** access to
abundant **[oil]{.underline}** revenues. With oil selling at around
\$100 per barrel, this represents a potentially staggering source of
wealth for Nigeria \[...\] Were these revenues -- estimated in the tens
of billions of dollars per year -- used to spur development \[...\]
Nigeria could be a great beacon of hope for Africa. In Nigeria, the
insurgent group [Boko
Haram](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13809501) is fighting to
overthrow the existing political system and establish a puritanical,
Muslim-ruled state. Although most Nigerians decry the group's violent
methods (including the kidnapping of hundreds of teenage girls from a
state-run school), it has [drawn
strength](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/11/northern-nigeria/verini-text)
from disgust in the poverty-stricken northern part of the country with
the
[corruption-riddled](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2387359/Nigeria-country-corrupt-better-burn-aid-money.html)
central government in distant Abuja, the capital. Nigeria is the largest
oil producer in Africa, [pumping
out](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ni) some 2.5 million
barrels per day. With oil selling at around \$100 per barrel, this
represents a potentially staggering source of wealth for the nation,
even after the private companies involved in the day-to-day extractive
operations take their share. Were these revenues -- estimated in the
tens of billions of dollars per year -- used to spur development and
improve the lot of the population, Nigeria could be a great beacon of
hope for Africa. Instead, much of the money
[disappears](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26535530) into the
pockets (and foreign bank accounts) of Nigeria's well-connected elites.
In February, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Lamido Sanusi,
told a parliamentary investigating committee that the state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had failed to transfer
some \$20 billion in proceeds from oil sales to the national treasury,
as required by law. It had all evidently been diverted to private
accounts. "A substantial amount of money has gone," he
[told](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/world/africa/nigerians-ask-why-oil-funds-are-missing.html)
the New York Times. "I wasn't just talking about numbers. I showed it
was a scam." **[For]{.underline}** many **[Nigerians]{.underline}** -- a
majority of whom subsist on less than \$2 per day -- the
**[corruption]{.underline}** in Abuja, when combined with the [wanton
brutality](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/14/how-nigeria-s-stupidly-brutal-cops-botch-the-hunt-for-boko-haram.html)
of the government's security forces, **[is a source of]{.underline}**
abiding **[anger]{.underline}** and resentment, **[generating recruits
for insurgent groups]{.underline}** like Boko Haram and winning them
begrudging admiration. "They know well the frustration that would drive
someone to take up arms against the state,"
[said](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/11/northern-nigeria/verini-text)
National Geographic reporter James Verini of people he interviewed in
battle-scarred areas of northern Nigeria. At this stage, the government
has displayed [zero
capacity](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/world/africa/nigeria-shows-its-weakness.html)
to overcome the insurgency, while its ineptitude and heavy-handed
military tactics have only further alienated ordinary Nigerians. The
conflict in [South Sudan](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14069082)
has different roots, but shares a common link to energy. Indeed, **[the
very formation of South Sudan is a product of oil
politics]{.underline}**. A [civil
war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sudanese_Civil_War) in Sudan
that lasted from 1955 to 1972 only ended when the Muslim-dominated
government in the north agreed to grant more autonomy to the peoples of
the southern part of the country, largely practitioners of traditional
African religions or Christianity. However, when oil was discovered in
the south, the rulers of northern Sudan repudiated many of their earlier
promises and sought to gain control over the oil fields, sparking a
[second civil
war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War), which
lasted from 1983 to 2005. An estimated two million people lost their
lives in this round of fighting. In the end, the south was
[granted](http://www.enoughproject.org/blogs/sudan-comprehensive-peace-agreement-and-south-sudan-independence)
full autonomy and the right to vote on secession. Following a January
2011 referendum in which
[98.8%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12317927) of southerners
voted to secede, the country became independent on that July 9th. The
very formation of South Sudan is a product of oil politics. The new
state had barely been established, however, when conflict with the north
over its oil resumed. While South Sudan has a plethora of oil, the only
pipeline allowing the country to export its energy stretches across
North Sudan to the Red Sea. This ensured that the south would be
dependent on the north for the major source of government revenues.
Furious at the loss of the fields, the northerners
[charged](http://sudanreeves.org/2012/01/25/sudan-south-sudan-and-the-oil-revenues-controversy-khartoums-obstructionism-threatens-war/)
excessively high rates for transporting the oil, precipitating a cut-off
in oil deliveries by the south and sporadic violence along the two
countries' still-disputed border. Finally, in August 2012, the two sides
[agreed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/south-sudan/9452032/Sudan-and-South-Sudan-reach-agreement-over-oil-after-tense-eight-month-dispute.html)
to a formula for sharing the wealth and the flow of oil resumed.
Fighting has, however, continued in certain border areas controlled by
the north but populated by groups linked to the south. With the flow of
oil income assured, the leader of South Sudan, President [Salva
Kiir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva_Kiir), sought to consolidate
his control over the country and all those oil revenues. Claiming an
imminent coup attempt by his rivals, led by Vice President [Riek
Machar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riek_Machar), he
[disbanded](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-23428557) his
multiethnic government on July 24, 2013, and began arresting allies of
Machar. The resulting power struggle quickly turned into an [ethnic
civil
war](http://www.enoughproject.org/conflicts/sudans/conflicts-south-sudan),
with the kin of President Kiir, a Dinka, battling members of the Nuer
group, of which Machar is a member. Despite several attempts to
negotiate a cease-fire,
[fighting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudanese_conflict_%282013%E2%80%932014%29)
has been under way since December, with thousands of people killed and
hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes. **[As in Syria and
Iraq, much of the fighting in South Sudan has centered
around]{.underline}** the vital **[oil]{.underline}** fields,
**[with]{.underline}** both sides **[determined to
control]{.underline}** them and collect the **[revenues]{.underline}**
they generate. As of March, while still under government control, the
Paloch field in Upper Nile State was
[producing](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-30/south-sudan-s-rebel-leader-machar-vows-to-target-key-oil-fields.html)
some 150,000 barrels a day, worth about \$15 million to the government
and participating oil companies. The rebel forces, led by former Vice
President Machar, are trying to seize those fields to deny this revenue
to the government. "The presence of forces loyal to Salva Kiir in
Paloch, to buy more arms to kill our people... is not acceptable to us,"
Machar
[said](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/world/africa/from-a-quiet-rebel-base-plotting-an-assault-on-south-sudans-oil-fields.html)
in April. "We want to take control of the oil field. It's our oil." As
of now, the field remains in government hands, with rebel forces
reportedly making gains in the vicinity. **[The South China
Sea]{.underline}** In both the [East
China](http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=ecs) and
[South China](http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=scs)
seas, China and its neighbors claim assorted atolls and islands that sit
astride vast undersea oil and gas reserves. The **[waters]{.underline}**
of both **[have been the site of recurring naval clashes]{.underline}**
over the past few years, with the South China Sea recently grabbing the
spotlight. An energy-rich offshoot of the western Pacific, that sea,
long a focus of
[contention](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349), is
rimmed by China, Vietnam, the island of Borneo, and the Philippine
Islands. **[Tensions peaked]{.underline}** in May **[when the Chinese
[deployed](http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/chinas-oil-rig-gambit-south-china-sea-game-changer/)
their]{.underline}** largest **[deepwater drilling rig]{.underline}**,
the HD-981, in waters claimed by Vietnam. Once in the drilling area,
about 120 nautical miles off the coast of Vietnam, the Chinese
surrounded the HD-981 with a large flotilla of navy and coast guard
ships. When **[Vietnamese coast guard vessels]{.underline}** attempted
to penetrate this defensive ring in an effort to drive off the rig, they
**[were
[rammed](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/world/asia/vietnam-china-paracels-fishing-boat-collision/)
by Chinese ships]{.underline}** and pummeled by water cannon. No lives
have yet been lost in these encounters, but [anti-Chinese
rioting](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/19/world/asia/china-vietnam-islands-oil-rig-explainer/)
in Vietnam in response to the sea-borne encroachment left several dead
and the clashes at sea are expected to continue for several months until
the Chinese move the rig to another (possibly equally contested)
location. To view the Chinese drive in the South China Sea as a simple
matter of nationalistic impulses would be a mistake. The riots and
clashes sparked by the deployment of HD-981 have been driven in large
part by
[nationalism](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349) and
resentment over past humiliations. The Chinese, insisting that various
tiny islands in the South China Sea were once ruled by their country,
still seek to overcome the territorial losses and humiliations they
suffered at the hands the Western powers and Imperial Japan. The
Vietnamese, long accustomed to Chinese invasions, seek to protect what
they view as their sovereign territory. For common citizens in both
countries, demonstrating resolve in the dispute is a matter of national
pride. But **[to view the Chinese drive in the South China Sea as a
simple matter of nationalistic impulses would be a
mistake.]{.underline}** The owner of HD-981, the China National Offshore
Oil Company
([CNOOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Offshore_Oil_Corporation)),
has conducted extensive seismic testing in the disputed area and
evidently believes there is a large reservoir of energy there. "The
South China Sea is estimated to have 23 billion tons to 30 billion tons
of oil and 16 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, accounting for
one-third of China's total oil and gas resources," the Chinese news
agency Xinhua
[noted](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-05/09/c_131576610.htm).
Moreover, China
[announced](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/world/asia/china-plans-to-send-second-oil-rig-to-waters-near-vietnam.html)
in June that it was deploying a second drilling rig to the contested
waters of the South China Sea, this time at the mouth of the Gulf of
Tonkin. **[As the world's biggest consumer of energy,
[China](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=CH) is
desperate to acquire fresh fossil fuel supplies]{.underline}** wherever
it can. Although its leaders are prepared to make [increasingly
large](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2014-02/06/content_17269251.htm)
purchases of African, Russian, and Middle Eastern oil and gas to satisfy
the nation's growing energy requirements, they not surprisingly prefer
to develop and exploit domestic supplies. For them, the South China Sea
is not a "foreign" source of energy but a Chinese one, and they appear
determined to use whatever means necessary to secure it. Because [other
countries](http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=scs),
including Vietnam and the Philippines, also seek to exploit these oil
and gas reserves, further clashes, at increasing levels of violence,
seem almost inevitable. No End to Fighting As these conflicts and others
like them suggest, fighting for control over key energy assets or the
distribution of **[oil]{.underline}** revenues **[is a [critical
factor](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175540/) in]{.underline}** most
**[contemporary warfare]{.underline}**. While ethnic and religious
divisions may provide the political and ideological fuel for these
battles, **[it is the potential for mammoth oil profits that keeps the
struggles alive]{.underline}**. Without the promise of such resources,
many of these conflicts would eventually die out for lack of funds to
buy arms and pay troops. So long as the oil keeps flowing, however, the
belligerents have both the means and incentive to keep fighting. In a
fossil-fuel world, **[control over oil]{.underline}** and gas reserves
**[is an essential component of national power. "Oil fuels more than
automobiles]{.underline}** and airplanes," Robert Ebel of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies
[told](http://2001-2009.state.gov/s/p/of/proc/tr/10187.htm) a State
Department audience in 2002. "**[Oil fuels]{.underline}** military
power, national treasuries, and international
**[politics]{.underline}**." Far more than an ordinary trade commodity,
"**[it is a determinant of well being]{.underline}**, of national
security, and international power for those who possess this vital
resource, and the converse for those who do not." If anything, that's
even truer today, and as energy wars expand, the truth of this will only
become more evident. **[Someday, perhaps, the development of renewable
sources of energy may invalidate this dictum. But in our present world,
if you see a conflict developing, look for the energy]{.underline}**.
It'll be there somewhere on this fossil-fueled planet of ours.

## Another possible 1NC approach 

#### Trump won't follow through with sanctions now but the plan results in Saudi Arabia retaliation, causes global economic disaster

**Torchia and Mohammad, 2018**

(Andrew and Arshad, "Saudi Arabia says will retaliate against any
sanctions over Khashoggi case," Reuters, 14 Oct. 2018,
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-politics-dissident-sanctions/saudi-arabia-says-will-retaliate-against-any-sanctions-over-khashoggi-case-idUSKCN1MO0F1>)

Saudi Arabia on Sunday warned against threats to punish it over last
week's disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as European leaders
piled on pressure and two more U.S. executives scrapped plans to attend
a Saudi investor conference. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington
Post columnist critical of Riyadh's policies, disappeared on Oct. 2
after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was
murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that. U.S.
President **[Donald Trump has threatened "severe
punishment"]{.underline}** if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the
consulate, **[though he said Washington would be "punishing" itself if
it halted military sales to Riyadh.]{.underline}** "The Kingdom affirms
its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether
by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures,
or repeating false accusations," the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA)
quoted an unnamed official as saying. "**[The Kingdom]{.underline}**
also **[affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with
greater action,]{.underline}** and that **[the Kingdom's economy has an
influential and vital role in the global economy,"]{.underline}** the
official added, without elaborating. The Saudi Embassy in Washington
later tweeted what it called a clarification, thanking countries
including the United States "for refraining from jumping to conclusions"
over the case. In a sign Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud may
seek a diplomatic solution to the incident, he stressed the strength of
Saudi-Turkish ties in a telephone call with President Tayyip Erdogan of
Turkey, the Saudi press agency said late on Sunday. The king thanked
Erdogan for welcoming a Saudi proposal to form a joint working group to
discuss Khashoggi's disappearance and said no one could undermine their
relationship. EUROPE SEEKS CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION Europe's largest
economies --- Britain, France and Germany --- said on Sunday they were
treating the case with "the utmost seriousness". "There needs to be a
credible investigation to establish the truth about what happened, and -
if relevant - to identify those bearing responsibility for the
disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, and ensure that they are held to
account," the countries said in a joint statement. "We encourage joint
Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi Government to
provide a complete and detailed response. We have conveyed this message
directly to the Saudi authorities." The statement, by Britain's Jeremy
Hunt, France's Jean-Yves Le Drian and Germany's Heiko Maas, made no
mention of potential actions the countries might take. Hunt later said
that if Saudi Arabia were proven to be guilty, "we would have to think
about the appropriate way to react in that situation." OIL PRICE WARNING
In a column published just after the SPA statement, Saudi-owned Al
Arabiya channel's General Manager Turki Aldakhil warned that **[imposing
sanctions on the world's largest oil exporter could spark global
economic disaster. "It would lead to Saudi Arabia's failure
to]{.underline}** commit to **[produc]{.underline}**ing **[7.5 million
barrels]{.underline}**. If the price of oil reaching \$80 angered
President Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to \$100, or
\$200, or even double that figure," he wrote.

Congress, these weapons sales will prolong suffering in
[Yemen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen) and eliminate one of
the last levers that allowed the US to exert influence over Saudi and
Emirati actions: the threat of Congress blocking arms deals. On 5 June,
a bipartisan group of senators said they would try [to block the
administration](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-arms/republican-democratic-senators-seek-to-block-trump-saudi-arms-sales-idUSKCN1T61PL/)
from going ahead with the sales by introducing 22 "resolutions of
disapproval" -- one for each of the deals cleared by Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo. The effort is led by two unlikely allies: Bob Menendez, a
Democrat from New Jersey and frequent Trump critic, and Lindsey Graham,
a Republican from South Carolina who is one of Trump's biggest
supporters. The two senators agree on one thing: that Saudi Arabia
should face more scrutiny of its actions in Yemen after Saudi agents
murdered the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul in October. Since then**[, members of Congress have tried to
force the Trump administration to reexamine its alliance with the
kingdom]{.underline}** -- especially its relationship with Mohammed bin
Salman, the brash and ruthless crown prince often considered an
architect of the Yemen war. **[But Trump and his senior aides have made
clear that they still support the prince and won't]{.underline}** try to

that concluded, with "high confidence", that Prince Mohammed ordered the
killing of Khashoggi. The Saudis have been dropping the bombs on
civilians, so if there is an emergency, it's a humanitarian emergency
Senator Chris Murphy The senators' effort, which includes seven
co-sponsors, is yet another example of Congress trying to claw back its
constitutional responsibilities. On 24 May, **[when Pompeo [notified
Congress](https://www.state.gov/emergency-notification-of-arms-sales-to-jordan-the-united-arab-emirates-and-saudi-arabia/)
that the administration would move ahead with the \$8bn deals without
congressional approval, he cited a rarely used provision of the Arms
Export Control Act which allows the president to bypass Congress if he
determines there is an emergency that impacts national
security]{.underline}**. Pompeo invoked the Trump administration's
favored bogeyman: an increased threat of "Iranian aggression". But over
the past month the administration [has
inflated](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/16/more-democrats-accuse-trump-of-inflating-iran-intelligence-nuclear-deal-pompeo-bolton-van-hollen-congress-senate/)
the threat posed by Iran to US troops and allies in the Middle East and
several hawkish Trump aides, especially national security adviser John
Bolton, have pushed for a new confrontation with Tehran. At Bolton's
request, the Pentagon [updated
plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/world/middleeast/us-military-plans-iran.html)
to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East. The administration
is using similar scare tactics to justify its end-run around Congress to
sell more weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. As Senator Chris Murphy,
a Democrat from Connecticut and one of the earliest critics of US
support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1131227316984668161):
"To state the obvious, there is no new emergency reason to sell bombs to
Saudi Arabia to drop in Yemen. The Saudis \[have\] been dropping the
bombs on civilians, so if there is an emergency, it's a humanitarian
emergency caused by the bombs we sell the Saudis." Trump's supposed
desire to end US involvement in foreign wars -- in Syria and Afghanistan
-- clearly hasn't superseded his wish to keep Saudi Arabia and the UAE
happy and continuing to purchase American weapons.
**[This]{.underline}** willingness to prolong the suffering of millions
of Yemenis also **[underlines the administration's]{.underline}**
single-minded **[obsession with countering Iran]{.underline}**. Trump
and his advisers repeatedly try to justify a prolonged war in Yemen by
blaming Iran and its support for the rebel Houthi militia. This
narrative ignores the fact that the Houthis did not receive [significant
help from
Iran](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/16/contrary-to-popular-belief-houthis-arent-iranian-proxies/)
before Saudi Arabia intervened in March 2015. With the administration
firmly behind its Saudi and Emirati allies, Congress offers the best
hope to end the American role in a war that has triggered one of the
world's [worst humanitarian
crises](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/02/1032811). In early April,
**[the House voted to cease military support for the Saudi-led
coalition]{.underline}** in Yemen, finally approving a bill to restrain
presidential war powers that has taken years to pass both chambers of
Congress. On 16 April, **[Trump [vetoed the

Two weeks later, **[the bill's supporters in the Senate tried to
override the veto but fell short, 53-45.]{.underline}** (It takes
two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes, to override a presidential veto.)
But the measure was still a turning point because it focused attention
on the extent and unpopularity of military support for Saudi Arabia and
its allies. Trump is provoking a nuclear As the political jockeying
unfolded in Washington, the United Nations Development Programme [issued
a
report](http://www.arabstates.undp.org/content/rbas/en/home/library/crisis-response0/assessing-the-impact-of-war-on-development-in-yemen-.html)
underscoring the extent of the humanitarian disaster being fueled by US
weapons and logistical support. The report warned that the death toll in
Yemen could rise to 233,000 by the end of 2019 -- far higher than
previous estimates. (The projection includes an estimate of 102,000
deaths from combat and 131,000 indirect deaths due to the lack of food,
health crises like a cholera epidemic and damage to Yemen's
infrastructure.) "The current conflict in Yemen is one of the greatest
preventable disasters facing humanity," the report said, adding that the
conflict has turned into a "war on children", with a Yemeni child dying
every 12 minutes. The report estimated that 140,000 of those killed by
the end of 2019 would be children under the age of five. Despite a
majority of Congress voting to end support, **[American assistance to
the Saudi-led war persists,]{.underline}** thanks to Trump's veto. In
their latest effort to stop the weapons sales, congressional critics of
the war will likely need to secure a veto-proof majority. It is a matter
of moral and political urgency.

#### Arms sales now despite congressional pressure

**Politi, 2019**

(Daniel, "Trump Defies Congress, Moves Forward With Weapons Sales to
Saudi Arabia," Slate, 25 May 2019,
<https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-defies-congress-weapons-sales-saudi-arabia-jordan-uae.html>)

President Donald **[Trump is ignoring concerns from Congress and is
[going ahead with the sale of more than \$8 billion worth of
weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/middleeast/trump-troop-increase-middle-east-iran.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.
The move came on the same day as Trump said he would be sending an
additional 1,500 troops to the Middle East to protect American that are
already in the region. **[The sale had been blocked by
Congress]{.underline}** since last year **[but Trump]{.underline}** has
now **[declared a national emergency [due to tensions with
Iran](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/8-billion-weapons-middle-east-3323593)]{.underline}**.
**[The decision]{.underline}**, which **[affects 22]{.underline}**
pending **[transfers of munitions, aircraft parts, and other
supplies]{.underline}** will serve "to deter Iranian aggression and
build partner self-defense capacity," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
said in a statement. Pompeo added that the current situation amounts to
"an emergency ... which requires the immediate sale" of the weapons "in
order to deter further the malign influence of the government of Iran
throughout the Middle East region." The move angered many in Congress
and shows how **[the White House continues to support Saudi Arabia even
as others pressure the administration to punish the
kingdom]{.underline}**'s leadership for the killing of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi. At the same time, many in Congress are growing increasingly
concerned about the civilian toll of the Saudi-led coalition's operation
against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen. The move immediately led to
criticism from congressional Democrats. "President Trump is only using
this loophole because he knows Congress would disapprove ... There is no
new 'emergency' reason to sell bombs to the Saudis to drop in Yemen, and
doing so only perpetuates the humanitarian crisis there," said Senator
Chris Murphy. And it wasn't just Democrats who made their unhappiness
known. Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who is the top Republican on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, [characterized the
move](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/24/politics/trump-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-uae/index.html)
as "unfortunate." Even though he said he understood the administration's
frustration, "the President's decision to use an emergency waiver on
these sales ... will damage certain future congressional interactions."
For his part, New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, who is the top Democrat on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said he was "disappointed, but
not surprised, that the Trump Administration has failed once again to
prioritize our long-term national security interests or stand up for
human rights, and instead is granting favors to authoritarian countries
like Saudi Arabia."

#### Trump views arms sales from an entirely business perspective -- squo congressional disapproval won't stop the transaction 

\*Trump doesn't care about human life, he \*\*believes arms sales help
the economy, US is best attitude

\*SA is the US's larger customer

**Abramson, 2018**

(Jeff -- senior fellow of arms control at the ACA and former policy
advisor at the global civil society alliance produced the Arms Trade
Treaty, "Trump Touts Saudi Arms Sales," Arms Control Association, April
2018,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/news/trump-touts-saudi-arms-sales>)

**[As]{.underline}** U.S. **[senators questioned military support for
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**'s war in Yemen, President Donald **[Trump
extolled U.S. arms sales in a high-profile meeting with the Saudi crown
prince]{.underline}**. In public remarks at the White House by the
president and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on March 20, **[Trump
held up posters with pictures of U.S. military equipment]{.underline}**
sold to Saudi Arabia **[and boasted, "We make the best military product
in the world,]{.underline}** whether it's missiles or planes or anything
else." **[These sales "really \[mean\] many, many jobs]{.underline}**.
We're talking about over 40,000 jobs in the United States," Trump said.
No basis for that number was provided, nor was a time frame because many
of the arms sales cited cover a number of years. Two days after the Oval
Office meeting, the administration notified Congress of potential arms
sales valued at more than \$1 billion, including more than 6,500
anti-tank missiles, as well as services and parts for Abrams tanks,
armored vehicles, helicopters, and other military equipment. Just before
the visit, a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) again found **[the United States to be the world's
largest arms exporter in a growing international market, with Riyadh
remaining by far the largest importer of U.S. weapons]{.underline}**.
(See [ACT, March 2017](https://www.armscontrol.org/aca/981).) Arms sales
to Saudi Arabia have been controversial, most recently as the Saudi-led
coalition fighting in Yemen has attacked civilian targets and
contributed to humanitarian suffering in the country. Last year, 47
senators voted unsuccessfully to stop a sale of precision-guided
munitions to Riyadh. (See [ACT, July/August
2017](https://www.armscontrol.org/aca/988).) On the same day as the
White House meeting, the Senate narrowly failed to pass a measure that
sought to end U.S. military support to the Saudi war in Yemen,
specifically referencing aerial refueling, intelligence sharing, and
targeting assistance to Saudi-led forces. Saying that Congress had not
approved U.S. military engagement and invoking the war powers
resolution, 44 senators voted to bring the measure to the full Senate,
where presumably it would have passed should a majority have agreed to
its full consideration. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who was among a
bipartisan group of co-sponsors, said afterward, "Every day that America
keeps helping Saudi Arabia bomb Yemen, we are less safe as a nation."
The vote "is a signal that the U.S. Senate is not going to stand idly by
and let this fatal foreign policy mistake continue unabated," he said.
SIPRI's annual report on trends in international transfers of major
weapons systems confirmed a central place for **[Saudi Arabia among the
98 countries to which the United States exported weapons from 2013 to
2017. Riyadh, whose total imports more than quintupled in that period,
accounted for 18 percent of Washington's exports, more than twice that
of the next]{.underline}** largest U.S. weapons
**[importer]{.underline}**, the United Arab Emirates. As conflicts
affected nearly all the countries in the Middle East, arms imports into
the region more than doubled, with Saudi Arabia importing hundreds of
combat aircraft and helicopters, tanks, and armored vehicles. The report
drew extra attention to the transfer of missiles for use against ground
targets by Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE from China,
France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The United States
alone accounted for 34 percent of global exports during 2013-2017, up
from 30 percent during the previous five-year period, and a
significantly larger share than Russia, the second-largest exporter at
22 percent. Although the total volume of international arms trade rose
by 10 percent during the period, Russia's share declined in part due to
reduced deliveries to Algeria, China, and Venezuela. Russia remains the
largest supplier to the world's top arms importer, India; but the United
States is now New Delhi's second-largest arms supplier, with U.S.
exports to the country up 557 percent. **[The Trump]{.underline}**
administration's **[approach to arms sales appears to differ from that
of]{.underline}** the **[Obama]{.underline}** administration **[in its
emphasis on economic considerations over human rights]{.underline}**,
according to a report released last month by the Security Assistance
Monitor. The Security Assistance Monitor report also challenges the
Trump administration's promotion of arms sales for their economic and
jobs benefits, noting that many proposed sales include provisions for
foreign manufacturing.

#### It doesn't matter that Trump doesn't understand foreign policy, the economy, or morality, he's going to continuing selling to the Saudis

**Chait, 2018**

**[Normally]{.underline}** these kinds of **[foreign policy questions
come down to morality versus foreign policy interest]{.underline}**. The
case for punishing Saudi Arabia is that it is threatening liberal values
and global freedom. **[There might be a realpolitik case for maintaining
the alliance. But Trump is not arguing on the basis of either values or
foreign policy interests. He's saying we need the money from the arms
sales]{.underline}**. (Note, also, that Trump argues we can't afford to
lose the arms sales because the economy is doing well, a rationale that
would work even better if the economy was doing poorly.) So **[Trump's
case against punishing Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** for murdering a
journalist **[is that we can't afford to reduce the profits our defense
companies make]{.underline}** from selling them weapons. And of course
**[this is perfectly consistent with Trump's conviction that American
foreign policy should be run]{.underline}** almost literally **[like a
mafia family,]{.underline}** using our strength to collect protection
money from friends and running smash-and-grab operations to [steal
resources](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-u-s-may-get-another-chance-to-take-iraqi-oil.html)from
weaker countries. The theory of American policy that Noam Chomsky
intended as an indictment is Trump's idea of a moral touchstone.

(William, "Donald Trump Is America's Number-One Weapon Salesman," The
Nation, 2 April 2018,
<https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trump-is-americas-number-one-weapon-salesman/>)

It's one of those stories of the century that somehow never gets treated
that way. **[For an astounding 25 of the past 26 years]{.underline}**,
the United States has been the [leading arms
dealer](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers) on the planet, at
some moments in near
[monopolistic](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R42678.pdf)fashion. Its
major weapons-producers, including Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed
Martin, regularly pour the latest in high-tech arms and munitions into
the [most explosive
areas](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy)
of the planet, with ample [assistance](https://www.dsca.mil/) from the
Pentagon. In recent years, the
[bulk](https://www.ciponline.org/images/uploads/actions/MAR_6%E2%80%94US_Arms_Sales_2017_Report_manual_footnotes_%281%29_1.pdf)
of those arms have gone to the Greater Middle East. Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** is only the latest American president to preside
over a global arms-sales bonanza. **[With remarkable
enthusiasm]{.underline}**, he's **[appointed himself America's
number-one weapons salesman, and he couldn't be prouder]{.underline}**
of the job he's doing. Earlier this month, for instance, on the very day
Congress was debating whether to end US support for Saudi Arabia's
[brutal
war](https://www.saferworld.org.uk/resources/news-and-analysis/post/761-yemen-three-years-of-war)
in Yemen, **[Trump engaged in one of his favorite presidential
activities:
[bragging](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-trump-saudi-prince-20180320-story.html)
about the economic benefits of the American arms sales he's been
promoting]{.underline}**. He was joined in his moment of braggadocio by
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the chief architect of that war.
That grim conflict has killed
[thousands](https://www.juancole.com/2018/03/apocalyptic-numbers-saudi.html)
of civilians through indiscriminate air strikes, while putting
[millions](http://www.unocha.org/yemen/about-ocha-yemen) at risk of
death from famine,
[cholera](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/03/26/wake-shameful-vote-us-senate-new-cholera-warning-yemen),
and other "natural" disasters caused at least in part by a Saudi-led
[blockade](https://www.nrc.no/news/2018/january/saudi-aid-package-to-yemen-insufficient-unless-blockade-ends/)
of that country's ports. That Washington-enabled humanitarian crisis
provided the backdrop for the Senate's consideration of a bill
co-sponsored by Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders, Utah
Republican Senator Mike Lee, and Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris
Murphy. It was aimed at ending US midair refueling of Saudi war planes
and Washington's additional assistance for the Saudi war effort (at
least until the war is explicitly authorized by Congress). The bill
generated a [vigorous
debate](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-yemen-war-vote_us_5ab15ea7e4b008c9e5f226aa).
In the end, on an issue that wouldn't have even come to the floor two
years ago, an unprecedented 44 senators voted to halt this country's
support for the Saudi war effort. The bill nonetheless went down to
defeat and the suffering in Yemen continues. **[Debate about the merits
of]{.underline}** that **[brutal war wa]{.underline}**s, however, **[the
last thing on the mind of a president who views his bear-hug embrace of
the Saudi regime as a straightforward business
proposition]{.underline}**. **[He's so enthusiastic about selling arms

from]{.underline}** pending **[weapons sales]{.underline}** to the
prince's country. You undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that
Michigan, Ohio, and Florida, the three crucial swing states in the 2016
presidential election, were specially highlighted. His latest stunt only
underscored a simple fact of his presidency: Trump's arms sales are
meant to promote pork-barrel politics, while pumping up the profits of
US weapons manufacturers. As for human rights or human lives, who cares?
To be fair, Donald Trump is hardly the first American president to make
it his business to aggressively promote weapons exports. Though it is
seldom a highlighted part of his presidency, Barack Obama proved to be a
weapons salesman par excellence. He made [more arms
offers](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-obama-administration-has-sold-more-weapons-than-any-other-administration-since-world-war-ii/)
in his two terms in office than any US president since World War II,
including an astounding [\$115
billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security/obama-administration-arms-sales-offers-to-saudi-top-115-billion-report-idUSKCN11D2JQ)
in weapons deals with Saudi Arabia. For the tiny group of us who follow
such things, that map of Trump's only underscored a familiar reality. On
it, in addition to the map linking US jobs and arms transfers to the
Saudis, were little boxes that highlighted four specific weapons sales
worth tens of billions of dollars. [Three of
those](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/major-arms-sales-notifications-tracker.html)
that included the THAAD missile defense system, C-130 transport planes,
P-8 anti-submarine warfare planes, and Bradley armored vehicles were, in
fact, completed during the Obama years. So much for Donald Trump's claim
to be a deal maker the likes of which we've never seen before. You
might, in fact, say that the truest arms race these days is between
American presidents, not the United States and other countries. **[Not

### Congress not checking Trump now

#### The idea of congressional check is refreshing, but it is failing

Arabia is a refreshing example of checks and balances," Desert News, 13

Bipartisan **[congressional efforts to keep]{.underline}** President
**[Donald Trump from selling \$8.1 billion in weapons and bombs to Saudi
Arabia and its allies represent]{.underline}** exactly **[the kind of
check and balance the Founders envisioned.]{.underline}** Congress holds
the purse strings. The president does not have dictatorial powers. It's
been so long since Congress exercised its watchdog role over
controversial matters that people may have forgotten the separate but
equal powers of the legislative, executive and judicial branches. But
this is an important government principle that, if used more often by
the people's representatives, would lead to negotiated settlements of
some of the nation's most divisive issues. **[In this case, President
Trump is so insistent on selling the weapons that he
would]{.underline}** attempt to **[sidestep Congress by declaring the
need for the sale a national security emergency.]{.underline}** That is
a dubious assertion, at best. The weapons are meant to help a Saudi-led
coalition in its fight against Iranian-supported rebels in Yemen.
Congress has good reasons to oppose this sale. After the recent,
apparently government-sanctioned murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
other human rights abuses and high numbers of unnecessary civilian
deaths in Yemen, the Saudis have become unreliable and unstable allies.
Also, evidence suggests previous sales of U.S. arms to Saudi Arabia have
ended up in the hands of terrorists, and might eventually be used to
attack U.S. interests. These **[objections have been
voiced]{.underline}** by Republicans as well as Democrats. Trump
supporters such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have vowed to stop the
sale. Reuters quoted Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, saying he supports
Saudi efforts in the Yemen war, "but the recent use of this emergency
authority, in my judgment, was unfortunate." Utah Sen. Mike Lee has
helped lead the charge. **[The Senate has drafted 22 resolutions
opposing separate pieces of the arms deal]{.underline}**, noting this is
to "protect and reaffirm Congress' role of approving arms sales to
foreign governments." That is a refreshingly correct declaration of the
separation of powers. **[The]{.underline}** Democrat-controlled
**[House]{.underline}** also **[can]{.underline}** be counted on to
**[oppose the sale. Unfortunately, this]{.underline}** is an
**[exercise]{.underline}** that ultimately **[will prove
futile]{.underline}**. **[The House and Senate]{.underline}** may indeed
muster the votes needed to block the arms sale, but they likely **[do
not have the votes to override a presidential veto of such a
blockage.]{.underline}**

## Relations

#### The relationship is based on oil and overlooking human rights abuses -- 

\*Saudi Arabia isn't feeling any of the current pressure from Congress
because they only care about the executive branch

Council Senior Director for the Middle East and North Africa; Daniel -

In the seventy-four years since it was conceived, **[the relationship
between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has
shown]{.underline}** remarkable **[durability]{.underline}**. **[One
reason for its resilience has been the ease with which it has evolved
as]{.underline}** the partners prospered and **[global politics
change]{.underline}**d. Riding a tide of oil wealth, Saudi Arabia has
been transformed from a congeries of seminomadic tribes into one of the
twenty largest economies in the world, while **[US involvement in
regional security grew so dominant]{.underline}** that for decades,
**[analysts spoke of the pax Americana in the Middle
East]{.underline}**. **[The relationship has also lasted]{.underline}**
in no small measure b**[ecause of American leaders' disinclination to
criticize the Saudis']{.underline}** domestic policies, **[especially
their disregard for human rights]{.underline}**. Bruce Riedel, an
adviser on the Middle East to four presidents, has noted that the sole
instance of an American leader pressing the Saudis for internal change
occurred in 1962, when, at the urging of John F. Kennedy, then crown
prince Faisal reformed the judiciary, introduced free health care and
education, and abolished slavery. **[The White House has long directly
overseen the US--Saudi relationship]{.underline}**, as it has the
US--Israel relationship, but generally not other bilateral ties. The
**[Saudi leadership has never taken the US Congress or the State
Department seriously and has always sought a direct link to the
president]{.underline}**. The CIA station in Riyadh exercises a high
degree of control over dealings with the kingdom, guarding against
intrusive diplomats with big ideas about promoting human rights and
obliging the Saudi preference for secrecy. **[The arrangement works in a
country where]{.underline}** historically **[there has been almost no
foreign press presence]{.underline}** or civil society organizations.
Saudi governance has traditionally been the preserve of a small number
of aged princes. Among US policymakers and intelligence analysts, it is
often said that no country is more opaque, except for North Korea. Today
this long-running accommodation may be crumbling as a result of the rise
to power of the impetuous Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman. **[US
congressional leaders]{.underline}** of both parties **[have expressed
outrage]{.underline}** at the thirty-three-year-old heir for his part in
the murder in Istanbul of the journalist and American resident Jamal
Khashoggi in October 2018, as well as **[for]{.underline}** other
misdeeds---particularly **[Saudi intervention in]{.underline}** the
brutal war in **[Yemen]{.underline}** that has turned that country into
the world's foremost humanitarian disaster. **[The recklessness of
MBS,]{.underline}** as he is known, **[has been abetted by the Trump
administration, which has boasted of its special relationship
with]{.underline}** the young de facto **[ruler]{.underline}** (his
father, King Salman, is in poor health, and MBS enjoys great latitude)
and has avoided criticizing him for his misadventures. Yet Democratic
contenders for their party's 2020 presidential nomination are lining up
to see who can Saudi-bash the loudest. The Democrats' outrage has been
further fueled by the suspicion that behind the president's uncritical
embrace of the Saudis are his hopes for personal enrichment from the
relationship---a reasonable surmise in light of the Saudi habit of
booking entire floors of his Washington hotel when delegations come to
town. As the de facto alliance approaches its seventy-fifth anniversary,
some American policymakers and scholars are questioning whether it still
makes sense for the US.

#### Trump is very committed to supporting Saudi Arabia and congress can't do anything about -- the only hope for restricting arms sales and re-shaping the relationship is the 2020 election

**Simon and Benjamin, 2019**

(Steven -- visiting professor @ Amherst and former National Security
Council Senior Director for the Middle East and North Africa; Daniel -
Director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding
at Dartmouth; "Reckless in Riyadh," The New York Review of Books, 30 May
2019,
<https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/06/27/mohammad-bin-salman-reckless-riyadh/>)

**[The question of how to punish the kingdom]{.underline}** and distance
the US from it **[is not easily answered. Washington has already
sanctioned]{.underline}** most of the **[individuals]{.underline}**
identified by the Saudis or others as having been **[implicated in the
plot to murder Khashoggi]{.underline}** by freezing their assets and
barring Americans from doing business with them, though it has balked at
targeting MBS, whose denials of involvement are wholly unpersuasive. The
Treasury Department also did not sanction General Asiri, MBS's confidant
and the former deputy head of Saudi intelligence. In the meantime,
dismay in Washington has not induced caution in MBS. The US intelligence
community recently exercised its "duty to warn" three regime opponents
that their lives were at risk. Ending US support for the war in Yemen
has been the goal of a bipartisan coalition in Congress, and the
unpopularity of the Saudi campaign led Mattis to curtail important
elements of the US assistance program in 2018, including air refueling
of Saudi jets. President **[Trump]{.underline}**, who has made
extravagant and false claims about Riyadh wanting to buy \$100 billion
in arms, **[seems determined to thwart legislative action to curtail
military aid to the Saudis.]{.underline}** Earlier this year,
**[Congress]{.underline}** approved legislation demanding a halt to all
such aid, including most weapons sales, logistics, and intelligence
support, but it **[was unable to override Trump's veto.]{.underline}**
**[The White House recently announced its intent to proceed with \$8
billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia,]{.underline}** the United Arab
Emirates, and Jordan **[by invoking a seldom-used clause in the Arms
Export Control Act that allows the executive branch to
bypass]{.underline}** Congress in emergency circumstances. This has
infuriated **[legislators]{.underline}**, who **[have vowed to prevent
the sales, though it is doubtful that they can do so.]{.underline}** As
**[the White House]{.underline}** builds up forces in the Persian Gulf
and prepares for a possible confrontation with Iran, it **[is determined
to avoid punishing its friends in the kingdom]{.underline}**. In
consequence neither the Trump administration nor Congress has much
leverage over the crown prince. Eight million barrels of oil per day
generate enough cash to pay for a public relations campaign that casts
Khashoggi as a dangerous Islamist and Saudi Arabia as an indispensable
partner of the US. President **[Trump has frequently called MBS a "great
ally."]{.underline}** More broadly, international interest in
sanctioning him or his regime is uneven. Vladimir Putin's support has
been vigorous, while the French and British are unwilling to forgo
lucrative arms sales to the kingdom. Germany has been the lone
exception, halting all arms exports to Riyadh since Khashoggi's murder.
Stirred up by the controversy surrounding the secret nuclear deal-making
and the execution in April of thirty-seven Saudis, most of them Shias,
on terrorism charges, Congress will continue to protest.
**[Despite]{.underline}** the unusual degree of **[bipartisan agreement
on the issue]{.underline}**---and Senator Lindsey Graham's unusual break
with Trump over renewed arms sales to the kingdom---**[this is unlikely
to have any real effect. Significant action]{.underline}**, if there is
any, **[will come only when the White House changes
occupants.]{.underline}** How far might a Democratic administration go
toward redefining US ties with Saudi Arabia? **[Bureaucratic resistance
from within the defense and intelligence establishments could be
significant,]{.underline}** and oil companies and financial institutions
have been clear about their long-term support for the relationship. Yet
MBS has tilted so far toward the Republican Party that some Democrats
will see no reason not to push for substantive change. Their argument
will be strengthened by the somewhat diminished US reliance on Saudi
oil---as a result of the rise in domestic production---and by American
weariness of costly engagement in the
region.[\*](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/06/27/mohammad-bin-salman-reckless-riyadh/#fn-*)
Saudi encouragement for the US to take armed action against Iran will
add to the alienation growing among Democrats, whose leading candidates
for the party's presidential nomination want the US to rejoin the
nuclear agreement repudiated by Trump. The Trump administration has
embraced the Saudi hard line against Iran, but Democrats remain
justifiably critical of a policy that seems designed to drive Tehran to
abrogate the nuclear accord that it continues to abide by**[. If a
Democratic president is elected in 2020 and decides to lift sanctions on
Iran and restore US adherence to the nuclear deal, that would have a
profound impact on Riyadh]{.underline}**. Its reaction, as well as the
likely caution of a new administration, will have a significant effect
on any effort to reshape the US--Saudi relationship.

At an oil executive gathering in India earlier this week, **[Saudi

to help keep supply and demand in balance. **[His statement might have
seemed innocuous]{.underline}** enough, **[had it not come amid
escalating rhetoric]{.underline}** in the ongoing controversy
surrounding the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. **[In
what was clearly a swipe at]{.underline}** President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}**, who has been complaining of late about oil
prices, **[the minister added, ["We expect and
demand](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/101518-saudi-arabia-will-raise-oil-production-next-month-energy-minister-falih)
that Saudi Arabia's efforts be acknowledged. These supply disruptions
need a shock absorber]{.underline}**. The shock absorber has been to a
large part Saudi Arabia**[." He noted that oil prices could
easily]{.underline}** have **[reach]{.underline}**ed over
\$**[100]{.underline}** a barrel, but for Saudi efforts. As an oil
analyst, I don't doubt that the minister is correct in this assessment
of Saudi Arabia's influence on prices. Trump also appears to agree,
since [he has been
tweeting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-rises-as-u-s-inventories-continue-to-fall-1537440113)
at Riyadh to do something more about high oil prices for weeks. Issuing
a not-at-all veiled threat to leave the Saudis to fend for themselves,
the president even went so far as to say King Salman [wouldn't last two
weeks](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/politics/trump-saudi-king-intl/index.html)
without U.S. military support. At another moment, Saudi Arabia's
reactions might have seemed just innocuous rejoinders in a war of words.
But **[in the context of a tightening world oil market, they belie a
serious, extortionate threat to use their important position in oil to
retaliate against any policy]{.underline}** (for example, a U.S.
congressional exercise of the Magnitsky Act) **[that might be considered
to dissuade Riyadh from future extra-territorial pursuit]{.underline}**
of journalists or dissidents. **[That makes the stakes very
high---regardless of]{.underline}** the improving **[prospects for
diplomatic de-escalation]{.underline}**---**[not only for
the]{.underline}** immediate welfare of the **[global economy, but also
for the kingdom's]{.underline}** future **[role]{.underline}** as the
trusted keeper of stability **[in global oil markets. Saudi Arabia has
often acted to calm oil markets ahead of troubled times.]{.underline}**
Notably, the kingdom even increased its oil exports in the aftermath of
the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to reassure a concerned global
economy that there would be no geopolitical implications for oil. The
Saudis took similar action around the time the United States invaded
Iraq. But in the runup to the U.S. decision to tear up the Iranian
nuclear deal and reimpose oil sanctions on Iran, Saudi Arabia initially
discussed a deal with Russia to cut output so as to boost oil prices to
\$80 or higher. That precipitated a tweet storm from President Trump
against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its most
important member, Saudi Arabia, in particular. One can only assume the
White House was appalled by the Saudi ingratitude that it was showing on
Iran. By contrast, Saudi Arabia had increased production when [President
Barack Obama was preparing to add sanctions against
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/31/business/global/obama-to-clear-way-to-expand-iranian-oil-sanctions.html)
back in 2012. **[Already, U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil exports
have removed 1 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels a day in sales to
Europe, Japan and South Korea this fall, pushing oil prices
up]{.underline}**. Saudi Arabia, after much jawboning from the United
States and even from India, increased its exports, replacing those
barrels. Still, **[crude oil prices continued to lurch above
\$80]{.underline}** a barrel recently as analysts started crowing about
how Saudi Arabia was now producing near its maximum, leaving little
cushion should a new geopolitical supply disruption emerge. For
barrel-counters, oil demand has averaged about 100.7 million barrels per
day this fall, while recent global supply is running roughly equal, at
100.6 million. Oil stocks typically are replenished this time of year,
ahead of winter. But given the current tight balance between supply and
demand, analysts are expecting that the usual pre-winter seasonal
buildup of an oil-inventory cushion might not happen this year. For
example, **[respected forecasters]{.underline}** Cornerstone Macro
**[project oil inventories will decline]{.underline}** by 500,000
barrels between September and year end. New problems in any of a host of
places, such as Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela or southern Iraq, could deepen
the shortfall. **[This tightening market situation is the backdrop to
Saudi Arabia's intemperate reference to the oil weapon.]{.underline}**
Officially, **[the government was vague, saying it would respond with
["greater
action](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/saudis-reject-threat-of-us-sanctions-over-khashoggi-disappearance-vowing-greater-action-in-retaliation-2018-10-14)"
to any economic sanctions threat against it]{.underline}** and reminded
of its vital role in the global economy. **[But it presumably authorized
a more strident]{.underline}**, explicit **[op-ed]{.underline}** on the

**[that warned of retaliation if any U.S. sanctions were
imposed]{.underline}** on Saudi Arabia. "**[We will be facing an
economic disaster that would rock the entire world]{.underline}**,"
[well-known Saudi media figure Turki Aldarkhil
wrote](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2018/10/14/US-sanctions-on-Riyadh-would-mean-Washington-is-stabbing-itself.html).
"**[If the price of oil reaching \$80 angered President Trump, no one
should rule out the price jumping to \$100, or \$200, or even double
that figure."]{.underline}** Talk like that makes one wonder: Given the
current tight oil market, can Saudi Arabia hold the world hostage, as it
did during the 1973 oil embargo? Although the immediate crisis could
possibly decompress with accountability within Saudi intelligence
leadership, my sense of market conditions is that **[Saudi Arabia could
absolutely wreak]{.underline}** some **[havoc]{.underline}**, but not
for long. Removing oil from the current market could increase prices,
perhaps precipitously---at least in the short run. Depending on how much
oil was removed from the market and how the Trump administration
responded regarding enforcement of Iranian oil sanctions, oil prices
might briefly jump up sharply. But western countries would almost
certainly release strategic stocks (the [G-7 unified
statement](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/52297/g7-foreign-ministers%E2%80%99-statement-disappearance-jamal-khashoggi_en) on
freedom of the press is salient) and, eventually, an easing of Texas
pipeline bottlenecks by early 2019 would allow the flow of more U.S.
tight oil to the global market. Higher prices would cause oil demand to
fall, especially in the developing world. In other words, retaliating in
the oil market could be a brief, Pyrrhic victory for Saudi Arabia,
unless it were done in tandem with other important oil producers. For
example, **[Moscow could inject itself into the situation by suggesting
it could collaborate with Riyadh on any oil-supply cuts and try to
elicit a pound of flesh from the U.S.]{.underline}** or even China.
Several pundits [have
explained](https://www.reuters.com/article/oil-prices-kemp/rpt-column-saudi-arabias-oil-weapon-doesnt-work-kemp-idUSL8N1WW4DZ) why
unsheathing the oil weapon would not be in Saudi Arabia's self-interest,
and current oil prices, which have risen only modestly in recent days,
reflect that belief. Still, **[the threat]{.underline}** itself
**[matters]{.underline}**. Its political damage has already been done.
It's hard to remain a central banker who inspires confidence after you
have threatened to bankrupt your depositors. The kingdom needs to go to
incredible lengths to retract this reckless impression before it sets
into a permanent stain, or it may find that its customers will take
concrete actions to remove the risk. Some countries were already looking
closely at how to accelerate electric cars, alternative energy programs
and other oil-saving measures in light of climate change. Now many more
countries will have impetus to do so quickly.Which is not to say the
peril of an oil crisis is over. **[Nations and their leaders are not
always out to make the sensible point.]{.underline}** In today's
dangerous world, the exercise of raw power has been rewarded in multiple
ways that cannot be quantified in light of national budgets or trade
balances.

#### Saudi Arabia will weaponize oil -- results in oil shocks with massive economic and geopolitical impacts

**Pickens, 2018**

(T. Boone, "What If Saudi Arabia Slows Oil Output Over The Khashoggi
Crisis? How The U.S. Should Respond," Forbes, 22 Oct. 2018,
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/tboonepickens/2018/10/22/what-if-saudi-arabia-slows-their-oil-spigot-heres-a-two-fold-solution-for-the-u-s/#dae37f01431e>)

It takes a crisis to get things done in Washington. This time, that
crisis is Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, the Saudis ended weeks of
uncertainty about the presumed death of a dissident journalist and
American resident, Jamal Khashoggi, claiming he was killed accidentally
during a fight in their consulate. The case, and their story, has
prompted outrage from the international community, with influential
businesses and individuals dropping out of the Future Investment
Initiative conference in Riyadh. Most importantly, lawmakers are calling
for the Trump administration to strongly respond. With President Trump
floating "severe punishment," and lawmakers like Sen. Lindsey Graham
calling to "sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia," the Saudis have been
facing an especially heavy scrutiny and pressure. In response, **[the
Kingdom]{.underline}** [issued a vague
statement](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/saudi-statement-sparks-concern-the-kingdom-will-weaponize-oil.html)
**[vowing to assert its "influential and vital role in the global
economy" and respond to any action taken with "greater action." Make no
mistake, this is a]{.underline}** veiled **[threat to weaponize
oil]{.underline}**. Let's contemplate for a minute just what that means.
**[The Saudis weaponized oil 45 years ago]{.underline}** with the Arab
oil embargo. **[It was economically devastating]{.underline}** for the
U.S., and the Saudis. They've pledge to never do that again, and oil has
largely been considered a fungible commodity ever since. Abandoning
**[that]{.underline}** commitment **[would be a stunning move and have a
severe impact on oil in a geopolitical and economic
sense]{.underline}**. Despite stunning production increases in the U.S.,
**[we still import 7.6 million barrels of oil each day. If
we]{.underline}** wake up one day and **find ourselves in a** new
**[world where oil is no longer fungible and countries]{.underline}**
around the world are actually **[mov]{.underline}**ing **[to lock
down]{.underline}** and secure actual barrels of **[oil]{.underline}**,
it means **[the free flow of oil will stop and those that are without
barrels will be in enormous economic pain.]{.underline}** Remember, this
has happened before. We have to have a plan for this potential outcome
now. For more than four decades, the Saudis have kept prices stable for
the U.S., even favoring us over Europe. **[Changing course overnight and
withholding supply would result in skyrocketing oil
prices]{.underline}** likely in the \$150 a barrel range, **[causing a
recession]{.underline}** here at home. The Saudis produce 10.5 million
barrels a day, and are supposed to be increasing that number to offset
the 2 million barrels of Iranian oil we are losing. In short, **[there
is nobody to make up Saudi production]{.underline}**. So, what do we do
if they slow the spigots?

**[that the United States would \"stab its own economy to death\" and
oil prices would soar to \$200 a barrel if Washington imposes sanctions

markets have for now dismissed the risk that Saudi Arabia could restrict
supplies. Speaking in India, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said
Monday that the kingdom would continue to act as \"the central bank of
the oil market\" to keep supply and demand in balance, according to
[media
reports.](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/101518-saudi-arabia-will-raise-oil-production-next-month-energy-minister-falih)
But **[if the crisis]{.underline}** over Khashoggi
**[escalates]{.underline}**, that **[commitment could crumble, say oil
experts. A rhetorical threat]{.underline}** to withhold additional
supplies \"**[could]{.underline}** certainly **[exert]{.underline}**
some **[upward pressure on prices,\"]{.underline}** said Helima Croft,
global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. And the
kingdom could go further, by \"slow-walking\" output increases to make
up for reduced Iranian supplies when US sanctions take effect next
month, Croft added. Filling the gap left by Iran **[Saudi Arabia pumps
around 10.5 million barrels of oil a day,]{.underline}** according to
OPEC data. It has previously said it is willing, along with Russia,
**[to fill the gap created by the return of sanctions on

nearly 1 million barrels per day,\" said Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil
market research at Rystad Energy. \"**[Saudi Arabia is the only country
that has spare production capacity \... to compensate for such
losses]{.underline}**.\" World oil markets have been transformed by a
doubling in American output over the past decade. For the first time
since 1973, the United States is the [world\'s largest producer of crude
oil](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html),
according to preliminary estimates published last month. As a result,
America is far less dependent on Saudi oil that it once was. In 2017,
the United States imported 9% of its oil from the kingdom, according to
the US Energy Information Administration. Imports from Saudi Arabia have
almost halved over 25 years. But **[the world]{.underline}**, and the US
**[still needs Saudi oil]{.underline}**. While US imports of Saudi oil
have declined, the kingdom remains the No. 2 source of foreign oil in
the United States, behind only Canada. Boom, then bust? **[Any move by
the Saudis to cut supply would push up global prices]{.underline}**,
hitting drivers in their pockets and further forcing up inflation that
already threatens to take the shine off America\'s economy. **[Such an
oil shock would come at a very sensitive time]{.underline}**. President
Donald Trump has [lashed out at

#### Saudi Arabia would tinker with oil prices -- the impacts are economic, political, and Iran

**VOA, 2018**

**("**US, Saudi Arabia Have Leverage on Each Other; Using It Has Costs,"
Voice of America, 16 Oct. 2018,
<https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-saudi-arabia-have-leverage-each-other-using-it-has-costs>)

As the world\'s largest oil exporter, **[Saudi Arabia has]{.underline}**
some **[ability to flood the market to depress oil prices or to curb
supply and raise them]{.underline}**. The kingdom generally seeks a
sweet spot to maximize current oil revenues without endangering future
earnings, which could happen if prices rose so high that they chilled
demand or encouraged development of alternatives. **[Saudi Arabia needs
oil revenue to fund state expenses]{.underline}** and its Public
Investment Fund, a **[sovereign wealth fund slated to play a leading
role in its drive to develop non-oil industries. On Sunday, the Saudi
Press Agency (SPA) quoted an unnamed Saudi official making
a]{.underline}** veiled **[threat to respond to pressure by tinkering
with oil supplies]{.underline}**. With the boom in production of U.S.
shale oil, the United States is less dependent on imported oil. However,
**[a Saudi decision to shrink global oil supplies and raise prices could
hurt]{.underline}** U.S. President Donald Trump by slowing **[economic
growth and]{.underline}** denting his 2020 re-**[election
prospects]{.underline}**. **[It could also undercut the U.S. effort to
shrink Iran's oil revenues, part of a wider U.S. strategy of forcing
Tehran to curb its nuclear and missile programs]{.underline}** as well
as its support for proxies in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. **[High
oil prices would raise Iran\'s revenues just as Washington wants to
reduce them]{.underline}**. Trump called Saudi King Salman on Sept. 29
to discuss efforts to maintain supplies to ensure oil market stability
and global economic growth, Saudi state news agency SPA reported.

### AT: Saudi keeps oil and politics separate

**New leadership = new policy about oil**

**Sheppard, 2018**

(David, "Saudi Arabia threat risks rare crack in US oil alliance,"
Financial Times, 15 Oct. 2018,
<https://www.ft.com/content/8f79ebba-d077-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5>)

For 45 years Saudi Arabia has stuck to a mantra of never using its power
as the world's largest oil exporter to threaten its western allies. But
**[in a sign of the pressure it is feeling over]{.underline}** the
disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, **[it came close over the
weekend to challenging that decades-old stance, warning it could
retaliate if targeted by the US through its "influential and vital role"
in the world economy. For an oil market beset by worries]{.underline}**
--- from renewed US sanctions on Iran to the collapse in Venezuela's
crude production --- **[the comments from Saudi Arabia came as a stark
reminder of its outsized role in energy markets]{.underline}**, but also
raised a question mark over the stability of its oil policy at a time of
flux in the kingdom. While Saudi Arabia quickly went into
damage-limitation mode on Monday, with energy minister Khalid al-Falih
reiterating the country's commitment to keeping markets well supplied,
some in the industry were still unsettled by an impetuous statement they
see coming from the very top. "**[It's]{.underline}** quite
**[extraordinary]{.underline}** as the Saudis have historically tried to
keep politics and economics separate, **[but right now they are trying
to remind the world of their strength]{.underline}**," said Gary Ross, a
seasoned oil watcher who runs Black Gold LLC. "It's uncharacteristic but
**[it reflects the new leadership of the kingdom,"]{.underline}** he
added, referring to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as
MBS. Prince **[Mohammed]{.underline}**, who has cemented himself as next
in line to the throne behind his father King Salman**[, has tried to
cultivate a reputation as a reformer, while becoming the primary
decision maker for everything from oil to military
policy.]{.underline}**

### Prices stable now

#### Oil prices are at the high end of stable currently -- in large part because of Saudi decision making 

**Paraskova, 6/18**

**[Oil prices erased earlier losses and surged on Tuesday

\$54.09, while [Brent Crude](https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/46)
prices were surging 2.72% at \$62.60.]{.underline}** Earlier on Tuesday,
oil prices were essentially flat as weak U.S. economic figures and
concern over the trade war, coupled with estimates for [yet another
record](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/The-Permian-Craze-Is-Fizzling-But-Shale-Oil-Production-Isnt.html)
in America's shale production, were offsetting fears of an oil supply
disruption due to increased tension in the Middle East. In recent days,
despite the escalating U.S.-Iran standoff after last week's attacks on
two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, oil market participants had turned
their attention to signs of weakening oil demand growth and slowing
economic activity in the face of a possible protracted trade war between
the world's two biggest economies. President Trump's tweet today,
however, sent **[oil prices]{.underline}** surging as the
market---**[weary of weeks of gloomy oil demand
outlook]{.underline}**s---**[lapped up the news that the U.S. and China
will resume the trade talks. The high tension in the Middle East also
supported the price of oil.]{.underline}** So did a report by [The Wall

#### Saudi Arabia controls the oil market -- it will only remain stable if they allow it to

**Cunningham, 2018**

(Nick, "Why The Saudis Are Still Dominating Oil Markets," 22 August
2018,
<https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Why-The-Saudis-Are-Still-Dominating-Oil-Markets.html>)

**[Saudi Arabia is still clearly in control of the oil
market]{.underline}**. The narrative that decisively took hold over the
oil market in August was one of cracks in emerging market demand,
[concerns over the health of the global
economy](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/What-Caused-Oils-Longest-Losing-Streak-In-Years.html)
and fears over the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war. Turkey's
[currency
crisis](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Turkey-Turmoil-Drags-Oil-Down.html)
set off a slide in emerging market currencies, which will likely
undercut demand this year. The IMF warned earlier this summer that the
downside risks to the economy were growing, a rather prescient
prediction. On the supply side of the equation, **[outages from Iran
loom large]{.underline}**. But **[when it comes to physical barrels on
the market, Saudi Arabia is still in the driver's seat.
"]{.underline}**While fears of trade wars will continue to influence
sentiment and shape price outcomes, **[it is the recent shifts in OPEC,
and particularly its dominant player Saudi Arabia's, output policy which
has had the biggest impact]{.underline}** on physical balances, prices
and the term structure to date," The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies
(OIES) wrote in a new
[report](https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/What-to-Make-of-Saudi-Arabias-Recent-Shift-in-its-Output-Policy.pdf).
For the first few months of this year, Saudi Arabia maintained that the
oil market was moving towards "rebalancing" with inventories in steady
decline, but that there was more work to do. Saudi officials repeatedly
stuck with the line that the OPEC+ agreement would not be altered before
the end of the year and that they would continue to focus on bringing
down inventories. But **[the Trump administration's withdrawal from the
Iran nuclear deal and the return of sanctions raised fears of a huge
disruption in Iranian supply]{.underline}**. Suddenly, **[the market
looked very tight]{.underline}**. Coming just a few weeks before the
June OPEC+ meeting, the U.S.' policy change was decisive.[Related:
Iran's Warning To OPEC: No One Can Overtake Our Oil
Quota](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Irans-Warning-To-OPEC-No-One-Can-Overtake-Our-Oil-Quota.html)
Oil prices rose sharply in April and May, and after a brief hiatus in
early June over fears of a wave of fresh OPEC+ supply, prices rose to a
high point at the end of the month. "The sharp rise in the oil price in
April, the anxiety it created among key consuming countries, the change
in the short-term supply outlook, Russia's push to increase output, and
**[US pressures on Saudi Arabia to act]{.underline}** to put a cap on
the oil price **[caused a revision in Saudi oil policy]{.underline}**,"
OIES wrote in its report. **[Saudi officials]{.underline}** stopped
talking about the need to keep up with the supply curbs in order to
rebalance the market and instead **[began sending signals]{.underline}**
market participants **[that Saudi Arabia would do "what is necessary" to
fill any supply gap leftover from Iran, Venezuela and Libya. The policy
shift in Riyadh had a major impact on the market]{.underline}**. Saudi
Arabia ramped up production well before the OPEC+ meeting. In June,
Saudi output jumped to 10.5 million barrels per day (mb/d), up 0.5 mb/d
from a month earlier. Much of that increase came before Saudi Arabia
knew what the outcome of the OPEC+ meeting would be. Some Gulf State
allies, such as the UAE and Kuwait, plus Russia, added production in
July. "This increase in production from core GCC producers and Russia
arrived at a time when the market did not need additional supplies
despite the rising concerns about outages," OIES concluded. Iran supply
had not yet declined and Libya restored some disrupted production. U.S.
exports of light sweet crude also rose sharply in June. Interestingly,
Saudi Arabia offered extra cargoes of extra light oil whereas Asian
refiners were looking for heavier crude mixes. "The additional supplies
overwhelmed the Atlantic basin, pushing Brent prices lower and flipping
the term structure into contango," OIES wrote. The sudden rush of supply
helps explain Saudi Arabia's retreat in July. Saudi output fell from
10.44 mb/d in June to 10.387 mb/d in July, a decline of 52,000 bpd. More
importantly, there were earlier press reports that suggested that Saudi
Arabia's initial plan was to continue to ramp up production to between
10.8 and 11.0 mb/d in July, which makes the decision to curb output all
the more notable. "If Saudi Arabia were to have increased its output to
10.8 mb/d in July as indicated by various reports, the term structure
would have weakened further and...prices would have fallen below
\$70/barrel."[Related: New Gulf Of Mexico Leases Raise
Concerns](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/New-Gulf-Of-Mexico-Leases-Raise-Concerns.html)
Some oil bulls thought that Saudi Arabia's decision to cut output in
July was a sign that it was aiming for higher prices, especially because
the narrative about pending supply shortages was still making headlines.
But OIES argues that rather than shooting for much higher prices,
**[Saudi Arabia was merely defending the price floor by curbing
production in July,]{.underline}** recognizing that oil supply was much
more robust than commonly thought. The upshot is that as we sit here
today, while demand fears have dragged Brent down into the low \$70s and
WTI into the mid-\$60s, **[Saudi Arabia continues to exercise broad
influence over the oil market]{.underline}**. **[Saudi Arabia continues
to calibrate its production levels so as to maintain price
stability]{.underline}**. More specifically, Riyadh seems to be aiming
for a price range between \$70 and \$80 per barrel, OIES argues, and
"its output policy will continue to be the major factor shaping price
outcomes in the next few months." **[Saudi output will rise and fall
depending on market developments. For all the talk about U.S. shale,
Iran, the trade war, the currency crisis, or any other potential
gamechanger, Saudi Arabia still exercises the most]{.underline}**
short-term **[control over oil prices]{.underline}**.

killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist that has shocked the

possibilities. While Saudi Arabia is still the leading producer in the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and can exert enormous
influence over oil prices, it is no longer the energy superpower that
American motorists feared during the Arab oil embargo era of the 1970s.
And as longstanding clients of the American arms industry, the Saudis
cannot easily switch to other providers. "They depend more on us than we
depend on them," said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the

killing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia.html?module=inline)
of the journalist, [Jamal
Khashoggi](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/world/middleeast/missing-saudi-journalist-jamal-khashoggi.html?module=inline),
at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Still, the possibility remained of an
escalation in the crisis, including American sanctions and Saudi
retaliation. Here is a look at Saudi Arabia's economic leverage over the
United States --- or absence of it --- and why it matters. Has Saudi
Arabia's coercive power in the oil market diminished? To some degree,
yes. The United States is far less dependent on Saudi Arabia and other
OPEC members than even a decade ago, when a drilling frenzy began in
shale fields across Texas and North Dakota. American production has more
than doubled since 2007 --- to 10.5 million barrels a day, from 5.1
million barrels a day --- and the United States has become a major
exporter for the first time in decades. The United States imports only
800,000 barrels a day from Saudi Arabia --- 600,000 fewer per day than a
decade ago --- and much of that goes to a Gulf of Mexico refinery owned
by Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company. A cutoff of Saudi oil,
which represents less than 5 percent of American supplies, would harm
Aramco and cut Saudi government revenue. And the United States could
replace those supplies with oil from other countries or from its own
fields. **[Jason Bordoff, a Columbia University professor and founding
director of its Center on Global Energy Policy, said]{.underline}** that
while the Saudis have a significant ability to curtail production and
raise the price, it is a weapon they are unlikely to use. "**[It would
have a severe negative impact on the global economy]{.underline}**," he
said. "It also would be very self-defeating. It would undermine the
reputation they built as a reliable supplier for 45 years." What about
the U.S. defense industry's reliance on the Saudis? **[Saudi Arabia is
by far the biggest foreign recipient of American-made weapons and
military gear]{.underline}**, according to a database compiled by the
[Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute.](https://sipri.org/databases/armstransfers) But while
President Trump has made much of Saudi Arabia as a critical client of
United States defense contractors, punctuated by its commitment last
year to purchase \$110 billion in American weapons, much of that
commitment has yet to be fulfilled. Some experts said that even **[if
Congress moves ahead to penalize the Saudis by suspending arms
sales]{.underline}** --- as appeared increasingly likely in recent days
--- the economic impact on the United States would not necessarily be
painful. "It **[would hurt]{.underline}** the stockholders of the
**[defense companies]{.underline}**, but these companies will do just
fine without these weapons sales," Mr. Kimball said. "It's not like
they're Sears Roebuck." Hasn't the drop in Iran's oil sales given the
Saudis more power in the market? Yes and no. Saudi Arabia welcomed Mr.
Trump's withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear accord and the resumption of
American sanctions, which have cut Iran's ability to sell oil. But the
United States is depending on Saudi Arabia to replace Iranian supplies
that had been going to Asian markets. A collapse of American-Saudi
cooperation would undercut their mutual goal of ostracizing the Iranian
government. Any reduction in Saudi exports would be welcomed by Iran,
the kingdom's archenemy, which would benefit from an increase in prices.
David Goldwyn, who was the State Department's top energy official in the
first Obama administration, said the Saudi threat to curtail production
had not been taken seriously by the oil markets, so far at least. Any
Saudi curtailment, he said, "would undermine their primary foreign
policy objective, which is containment of Iran." The Saudis, Mr. Goldwyn
said, are also loath to create economic conditions that would accelerate
shifts to electric vehicles, hastening the obsolescence of their primary
export. So is the Saudi threat largely empty? Memories of oil embargoes
by Saudi Arabia and OPEC, and the gasoline lines that they caused a half
century ago, are fading. Still, **[Saudi Arabia is an oil power with
persistent influence over prices]{.underline}**. It currently produces
more than 10 percent of the world's supplies**[. As Venezuela's
production plummets because of political problems, and as renewed
American oil sanctions on Iran bite further, the Saudi influence will be
amplified]{.underline}**. Ed **[Hirs, an energy economics professor at
the University of Houston, said a threat to the oil markets lurked if
Congress were to cut arm sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. In
response, he said, **[the Saudis "could cut production, which would
raise the price of oil, which would have a negative impact on the U.S.
economy --- or they could increase production dramatically and drive the
crude price down, which would damage the U.S. oil industry
incredibly]{.underline}**." In recent months, Saudi Arabia has increased
its production and exports to help satisfy Asian customers worried about
supplies. The kingdom has coordinated with Russia, which is also
increasing production, further relieving price pressures. And OPEC has
gone along with the supply increases, despite complaints from Iran.

#### More evidence that provides context and confirms sanctions here means ending or limiting arms sales

The mystery surrounding Khashoggi's fate and claims of his murder in
another country have created an international storm, with media
following every grisly details and **[demands from U.S. senators that

senators invoked the Global Magnitsky Act of 2016 to seek an
investigation into Khashoggi's fate, a move apparently aimed at
prompting a more active response from an administration that has been
restrained in its reaction. Before his latest threat, **[Trump had said

deals]{.underline}** worth more than \$100 billion as Saudi Arabia would
only buy Russian and Chinese weapons instead. The controversy has also
overshadowed a major investment conference planned to start Oct. 23 in
Riyadh. Several global executives have said they will pull out of the
event, widely dubbed the "Davos in the Desert." **["If there are U.S.

#### Whatever happens, it will be really bad the market is both volatile and fragile

\*oil market has been v. volatile

\*it is fragile because ups and downs, Iran sanctions, Venezuela
production is down

\*The US can't make up for the loss

**Carlson, 2018**

(Debbie, "\$100 a barrel? Will Iran sanctions and Venezuela crisis bring
oil price spike?," The Guardian, 12 Oct. 2018,
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/12/oil-price-barrel-markets-iran-sanctions>)

Unthinkable just a few years ago, oil could soon hit \$100 a barrel. The
reasons are manifold. Looming Iranian sanctions in November, supply
problems in the US and less spare capacity from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) all have some crude-oil market
participants betting that black gold prices may head to \$100 -- a price
unseen since 2014. "**[There's]{.underline}** really **[no margin for
error in the global markets right now]{.underline}**; markets appear to
be undersupplied ... We don't have a big glut of oil any more," said Rob
Thummel, managing director and portfolio manager at energy-investment
firm Tortoise. As recently as 2016,
**[[Opec](https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec) overproduction and
rising US shale output created an oil glut, pushing]{.underline}** the
global benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) **[crude-oil
prices to under \$30. Increased global demand and normalized production
levels have caused prices to rise]{.underline}** to their current levels
of about \$84 for Brent and \$74 for WTI, the highest in nearly four
years. [Oil](https://www.theguardian.com/business/oil) prices slipped
hard this week as stock markets fell and figures showed larger stock
piles of oil in the US than expected but traders are increasingly
betting that the only way is up for oil prices. According to data from
the CME Group, in the last week the number of trades speculating on
\$100 a barrel rose to a record 31,000. As of Wednesday, the current
number of open positions is slightly under that record level. An option
is a right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a commodity at a
certain price. **[Much of the pressure on oil prices comes from
Washington.]{.underline}** In May, **[[Donald
Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) withdrew from
the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions, prohibiting Opec's
third-largest member from selling crude oil]{.underline}**. Those
sanctions go into effect on 4 November. Thummel says up to 2m barrels a
day of Iranian crude oil may be off the market, **[which comes at a time
when other Opec members like Venezuela are producing a fraction of what
they can pump. Saudi Arabia is]{.underline}** also limited with how much
extra it can supply, as it is probably **[near the top of its
capacity]{.underline}**. Energy fund manager Emil van Essen, chief
executive officer and chief investment officer of Emil van Essen, said
no one thought the US would put as much pressure on Iran as it has. "It
is removing a ton of barrels and there really is not enough to make up
for it," he said. **[A potential row with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**
over the disappearance of journalist [Jamal
Khashoggi](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/11/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-under-pressure-from-trump-administration)
**[could]{.underline}** also **[spill over into oil]{.underline}**,
although analysts say there are no signs of that yet. **[The US
is]{.underline}** also **[having]{.underline}** its own **[logistical
and economic problems]{.underline}**, Daniel Ghali, commodity analyst at
TD Securities, and Thummel said. **[Pipeline constraints in the US's top
shale-oil field, Texas's Permian basin, limit how much oil can leave the
region]{.underline}**. Because of the bottleneck,
**[companies]{.underline}** drilling there **[get]{.underline}** about
\$**[15 a barrel less]{.underline}** for their Permian oil versus the
WTI benchmark, **[which means they are not benefitting from the price
run-up]{.underline}**, Thummel said. **[If there is another global
supply disruption, "\$100 a barrel is not out of the
question",]{.underline}** Ghali said. Jason Bloom, global macro
exchange-traded fund strategist for Invesco, and a 15-year oil market
veteran, agreed a spike to \$100 is possible, but a move higher would
only be temporary, saying that the current supply and demand situation
doesn't merit \$100. Van Essen said he doesn't see \$100 oil happening
this year, but said supply shortages next year will be critical because
of IMO 2020, new global shipping rules that go into effect on 1 January
2020, forcing ships to reduce fuel emissions by using low-sulfur fuel or
installing scrubbers to remove the sulfur. "It requires the oil refiners
to use lower-sulfur light sweet crude \[to make the fuel\] and there's
just not enough to go around," he said. With oil prices at four-year
highs, some global leaders have asked producers to kick in more oil. On
Wednesday, the head of the International Energy Agency urged Opec and
other major oil producers to open the spigots to prevent high prices
from damaging the global economy.

#### This shock will be especially bad -- generic defense does not apply

But if **[it\'s hit with sanctions, Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** says it
**[will hit back]{.underline}**. Director at the Centre for Arab and
Islamic Studies at the Australian National University, Amin Saikal, says
there are two major cards Saudi Arabia can play. \"The instruments that
Saudi Arabia has on its hand is of course oil and the sovereign funds.\"
Saudi Arabia recently flexed the muscle of its sovereign funds, shutting
down new trade and investment with Canada over a diplomatic spat. But
investors are more concerned about what happens it if pulls the oil
trigger. Oil price shock in 1973-74 ravaged US economy Donald Trump

sensitive to the risks of imposing sanctions on Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** --- particularly with the US mid-terms just weeks
away. (Reuters: Yuri Gripas) The Middle East has form in using oil to
make a political point. **[In 1973]{.underline}**, Saudi Arabia was
party to the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries which
proclaimed an oil embargo on those countries (including the United
States) which had supported Israel in the Yom Kippur war. **[The oil
price shock and]{.underline}** the accompanying **[stock market
crash]{.underline}** in 1973-**[74 ravaged the]{.underline}** US
**[economy. The embargo drove global prices up fourfold]{.underline}**
before it was lifted in March 1974. Long queues formed at gas stations
in the US. Rationing was implemented, whereby some vehicles were
restricted as to when they could purchase fuel based on their number
plates (ending in odd numbers meant you could purchase on odd days and
vice versa). US President Donald Trump would be sensitive to the risks,
especially considering the crucial mid-term elections are just weeks
away. \"The fact \[is\] that **[it could create a panic of energy
crisis]{.underline}** that could also affect the American consumers and
could possibly really hurt the Trump administration,\" Dr Saikal said.
\"**[That\'s why]{.underline}** I think Donald **[Trump has
been]{.underline}** very **[careful to not jump on the bandwagon and
declare]{.underline}** that he is going to put
**[sanctions]{.underline}** on Saudi Arabia.\" Although Mr Trump
initially promised \"severe punishment\" for Saudi Arabia if it was
proven they were responsible for the death, he has since backtracked and
said \"rogue killers\" might be to blame. **[Former CIA
agent]{.underline}** and now analyst at RBC Capital Markets, **[Hilma
Croft, says]{.underline}** the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi is \"the
most serious rupture in US-Saudi relations since 9/11\" and that **[she
\"cannot entirely rule out that the leadership would dust off the 1973
playbook if the bilateral relationship with Washington
deteriorates]{.underline}** sharply from here\". **[Even
before]{.underline}** **[Khashoggi\'s disappearance, the world has seen
a substantial oil price rise]{.underline}** over the last two years.
**[Brent Crude doubled]{.underline}** from around US\$40 to over US\$80
today, **[as]{.underline}** political **[instability in

CitiGroup, Matt King, said **[an oil shock could roil global markets
which have demonstrated their collective jitteriness of
late]{.underline}**. \"It does feel as though **[markets are sensitive
to any and every shock]{.underline}** this year, in a way they weren\'t
previously,\" he said. \"So if this becomes just that catalyst which
causes investors to want to pull back, or forces central banks to hike
interests that little bit faster, then it could have a considerable
impact.\"

#### Countries will shift to Iran despite Trump sanctions

**Clarke, 2018**

(Carrington, "Threat of sanctions against Saudi Arabia hang in the air

<https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-19/sanctions-possible-for-saudi-arabia-after-khashoggi-murder/10393456>)

Mr **[Trump]{.underline}**\'s administration has withdrawn from the Iran
nuclear deal and is continuing to ratchet up the pressure on the
country. But he **[was relying on Saudi Arabia to increase its
production in oil to offset the expected loss from Iran as sanctions
started to bite. \"If there is an energy crisis]{.underline}**, then
most of **[the countries that the United States has requested to not buy
Iranian oil may]{.underline}** well **[overlook the American threats and
buy oil from Iran,\"]{.underline}** said Dr Saikal. \"**[Iran has the
capacity to increase its production by 2 to 3 million barrels a
day]{.underline}**.\" Mr King believes the big difference between today
and the 1970s is that the US now has plentiful supplies of shale oil
which can be quickly turned on if the price rises. He said he doesn\'t
think Saudi Arabia has the same ability to derail the global economy,
\"both because of the ability of shale to act as an offset and because
of the reduced influence of OPEC\". \"It just feels like OPEC doesn\'t
have the same stranglehold over global oil prices that it had back
then,\" he said.

**[Saudi Arabia's status as the biggest oil exporter gives it the power
to jolt the global economy]{.underline}** --- if it wants. That was the
kingdom's message when it warned Washington and President Donald Trump
against imposing sanctions over the disappearance of Saudi journalist
Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident. Trump, who bragged at rallies about
his business dealings with rich Saudis, said over the weekend there
would be "severe punishment" if evidence points to Saudi responsibility
for Khashoggi's disappearance. On Sunday, the Saudi government
threatened to retaliate against any punishment such as economic
sanctions, outside political pressure or even "repeated false
accusations." Trump tempered his comments on Monday after talking to
Saudi King Salman and suggested "rogue killers" may be to blame. He
dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to visit the king. And Saudi
Arabia's energy minister seemed to walk back Riyadh's threat the next
day. But **[if the United States were to follow through with
sanctions]{.underline}** --- as some lawmakers such as Republican Sens.
Mark Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona have urged --- **[the
Saudis could react by reducing oil exports. That would lead to a steep
increase in prices,]{.underline}** perhaps to \$100 a barrel, in the
view of some analysts. Globally, **[the kingdom wields enormous
influence over prices. It is the de facto leader of]{.underline}** the
**[O]{.underline}**rganization of the **[P]{.underline}**etroleum
**[E]{.underline}**xporting **[C]{.underline}**ountries,
**[which]{.underline}** together **[account for]{.underline}** about
**[one-third of global crude production]{.underline}**. **[The Saudis
have more spare production capacity than anyone else; no other producer
appears able to fill the void if Saudi oil were to disappear from the
market.]{.underline}** That means Saudi Arabia could cause trouble for
Trump ahead of next month's elections, in which the Republican party is
trying to avoid losing control of the House of Representatives. **[Just
announcing a production cut would cause an immediate price
spike]{.underline}** --- a prospect that would deter significant U.S.
sanctions. "From Trump's point of view, given the mid-term elections are
lurking, that could have an impact," said Paul Stevens, an oil expert at
the Chatham House, a London think tank. "Simply stating that ---
threatening it --- might be enough to tip the balance." The Saudis have
reason to step back from the precipice. Their economy still depends on
oil, and **[the U.S. is the third-biggest destination for Saudi
crude]{.underline}**, according to ClipperData. Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman has laid out an ambitious vision of diversifying the economy,
but it is only a vision. Energy analyst Phil Flynn said that if Saudi
Arabia did anything to cause a price surge, "they would be shooting
themselves in the foot. If they cut off supplies, it could put the world
into a recession and that would lower the demand for oil." Other
analysts said an oil shock would accelerate efforts in consuming
countries to switch to other forms of energy. U.S. reliance on Saudi oil
has declined as domestic production soared during the shale-drilling
boom of the past decade. America has likely already passed Russia and
Saudi Arabia to become the world's biggest oil producer, according to
U.S. government estimates. In July, about 11 percent of U.S. imports
came from Saudi Arabia, compared with 45 percent from Canada, according
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Still, **[any disruption
would hurt both U.S. and Saudi interests]{.underline}**, and leaders of
both countries want to ensure that the relationship survives, said Kevin
Book, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners. **[The U.S. views Saudi
Arabia as a key ally in fighting]{.underline}** Islamic **[terrorism
and]{.underline}** serving as a counterweight to **[Iran. "Oil is part
of the story]{.underline}**, but the U.S.-Saudi relationship is forged
on bigger things," Book said. "The relationship has had its ups and
downs, but I don't think anybody in any administration would want to
throw the baby out with the bath water, and certainly not throw out the
oil." **[For decades, Saudi Arabia has sent oil to the United States and
the U.S. has sent fighter planes and other weapons to the
kingdom]{.underline}**. **[Trump has said repeatedly that he does not
want to stop]{.underline}** a proposed \$110 billion **[arms sale to the
Saudis --- even though some in Congress say he should]{.underline}** ---
because it would cost jobs in the U.S. "We would be punishing
ourselves," said Trump, whose first foreign trip as president was to
Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have suffered what they considered indignities
from the U.S. without using oil as a weapon in the past. In 2013, the
Riyadh government took the rare step of rejecting a U.N. Security
Council seat in what was widely seen as anger over a muted international
response to violence in Syria and a nuclear deal with Iran. Three years
later, the Saudis were unhappy but took no action when Congress --- over
President Barack Obama's veto --- passed a law making it easier for
families of people killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to sue
Saudi Arabia. **[In instances where the Saudi government has carried out
its threats, the impact has been felt globally]{.underline}** but
without the desired outcome. The Saudis took part in the 1973-74 oil
embargo against Western countries for supporting Israel and although
that boosted global prices, it failed to achieve its goal of effecting
political changes in the Middle East.

#### \*\*The relationship is old and reliable but susceptible in this geopolitical moment- collapse results in China fill-in and collapse of US power

**Hannah, 2019**

(John- senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies,
focusing on U.S. strategy, "The U.S.-Saudi relationship is in real
trouble. And things could get worse---even much worse." 30 March 2019,
<https://www.israpundit.org/the-u-s-saudi-relationship-is-in-real-trouble-and-things-could-get-worse-even-much-worse/>)

It's true that there's a lot of ruin in U.S.-Saudi ties. The
relationship has endured oil boycotts, the 9/11 attacks (15 of the 19
hijackers were Saudi nationals), and more than 70 years of constant
clashing of cultures and values. The **[national interests that have
bound Washington and Riyadh together through the decades,]{.underline}**
despite their deep differences, remain formidable. **[But real changes
are now afoot in the underlying dynamics]{.underline}** of the
relationship. They should at minimum give pause to anyone who blithely
assumes that there's no amount of public derision that the United States
could heap on the kingdom that might put the broader U.S.-Saudi
partnership at risk, and the Trump administration should take notice.
**[One such change is the rapid rise of Saudi
nationalism]{.underline}**---especially among the country's large youth
population. As part of his reform agenda for transforming the kingdom,
Mohammed bin Salman has consciously sought to build a new sense of
identity among Saudis, grounded in nationalism rather than Wahhabism,
the fundamentalist religious sect that served as an ideological gateway
for terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State. While
largely a positive development, the nationalist tide could have a double
edge, as I learned on an Atlantic Council trip to Riyadh in February.
**[It was striking how many researchers, activists, and government
officials in Riyadh seemed defensive, resentful, and even angry when
asked about the United States. "We're getting sick and tired of having
our country reduced to its worst mistakes," one woman said, referring to
the Khashoggi tragedy]{.underline}**. Another said, "Thanks to the crown
prince, the lives of millions of women are being positively transformed
in ways that our mothers couldn't even dream of. If the United States
can't appreciate the historical importance of what's happening here, and
chooses to focus only on our faults and trying to change our leadership,
then you're hurting our cause---and I'll oppose you." Whether justified
or not, the sense of hurt, of being misunderstood and unfairly attacked,
even humiliated, appeared genuine. It's not hard to see how that kind of
**[raw populist emotion, sufficiently stoked, could result in
overreaction]{.underline}**, miscalculation, and counterproductive
policies. At a minimum, it's a new variable in the equation that U.S.
policymakers, in both the administration and Congress, should be taking
into account as they calculate how best to pressure the kingdom to
change its most problematic behaviors. Perhaps **[an even more important
change]{.underline}**, one that amplifies the potential risks of a
possible nationalist backlash, **[is the emergence of great-power
competitors]{.underline}** with the United States, **[especially
China]{.underline}**. It's still the case that Saudis overwhelmingly
prefer Washington to remain their dominant global partner. If nothing
else, they know that if the worst were to happen, and war with Iran
came, neither Russia nor China would lift a finger to save the house of
Saud. The U.S. military still would---probably. But that "probably" is
itself a growing problem, one which has been getting worse over the past
decade as **[two successive U.S. presidents of both major
parties]{.underline}** have increasingly **[signaled their determination
to do less, not more, in the Middle East to guarantee]{.underline}** the
**[security]{.underline}** of partner states. Inevitably, **[as the
perception of U.S. retrenchment deepens, the Saudis are hedging their
bets and developing new geostrategic options]{.underline}**. Today,
**[China]{.underline}** is Saudi Arabia's
[largest](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/asia/saudi-arabia-china-mohammed-bin-salman-intl/index.html)
trading partner. It's **[among the biggest customers for Saudi
oil]{.underline}**---while the U.S. shale boom increasingly poses the
greatest threat to Riyadh's economic prosperity. Thanks in no small part
to decades of intellectual-property theft on a world-historical scale,
**[Chinese technology, including
[military](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2182257/some-chinese-military-tech-surpasses-us-pentagon-admits-citing),
intelligence, and cyber systems, as well]{.underline}** as critical

with the]{.underline}** best **[U.S]{.underline}**. high-tech offerings.
**[And Beijing]{.underline}**, like Moscow, **[is perfectly prepared to
sell its]{.underline}** most **[advanced capabilities to Riyadh with no
strings attached. No complaints about the kingdom's human rights
record.]{.underline}** No mentions of Khashoggi. No threats to withdraw
support as punishment for the war in Yemen. As was painfully obvious
during Mohammed bin Salman's recent [values-free
trip](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/22/saudi-crown-prince-defends-chinas-right-put-uighur-muslims-concentration/)
to China in February, **[in an increasingly ideological age of
great-power competition that pits Western-style liberal democracy
against Beijing's model of authoritarian capitalism, it's no secret in
which camp the house of Saud feels most at home]{.underline}**. The only
point being that the **[decades-old assumptions that have governed the
U.S.-Saudi relationship]{.underline}**, while largely still valid,
**[may be on increasingly shaky ground]{.underline}**. Before the Senate
passed a resolution earlier this month to end all U.S. support for the
Saudi war in Yemen, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut confidently
[reassured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNRzgyFmbPQ) his colleagues,
"The Saudis won't go somewhere else." The suggestion that they might
turn to another great power for weapons, he claimed, "is belied by how
this alliance has worked for years and the complication of the Saudis
turning around and choosing to go to another partner." While I'd still
bet that Murphy is more right than wrong on this issue, if only due to
the immediacy of the Iranian threat for Riyadh, I increasingly lack his
sense of certitude. **[Saudi Arabia, U.S. foreign policy, and the global
balance of power are all now in flux in ways that are quite
unprecedented]{.underline}**. Even 30 years ago, the Saudis were capable
of some nasty surprises, such as
[purchasing](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/18/world/us-says-saudis-are-buying-missiles-from-china.html)
intermediate-range ballistic missiles from China capable of striking
Israel. And just a couple of months ago, credible
[reports](https://www.apnews.com/092c1656a26b484e8e912d1960c65a98)
emerged that the Saudis have built a facility for producing and testing
solid-fuel ballistic missiles west of Riyadh---one with features that
bear striking similarities to comparable facilities in China. The danger
that **[as Saudi doubts about the United States' reliability grow, so
too will their efforts to hedge by looking for weapons and
support]{.underline}** (in Murphy's words) **["somewhere else,"
including to hostile great-power rivals of the United States,
is]{.underline}** probably greater than it's ever been in the history of
the countries' relationship. **[The recent
[decision](https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2019/02/22/Saudi-Arabia-to-include-Chinese-language-in-educational-curriculum.html)
to introduce Chinese-language instruction at all stages of the Saudi
educational system was no accident]{.underline}**. To its credit, the
Trump administration has been prepared to expend significant political
capital, including among congressional Republicans, to try and insulate
the U.S.-Saudi partnership from the withering (and in too many cases,
irresponsible) attacks from both Capitol Hill and the media. But that
virtue has been a vice as well. Too often, the administration's defense
of the strategic relationship has appeared as unduly solicitous of
Mohammed bin Salman's sensitivities, unnecessarily dismissive or even
contemptuous of Congress' legitimate concerns, and insufficiently
attentive to Saudi actions that have genuinely threatened both U.S.
interests and values. The fact is that over the course of the past 18
months, Mohammed bin Salman has engaged in a series of reckless and
destabilizing behaviors that should have been setting off alarm bells
across the administration. Instead, almost without exception, they were
met with the diplomatic equivalent of a shrug. From

over an objectionable tweet or two, the administration was largely AWOL
when it came to calling the Saudis to account and attempting to
short-circuit the crown prince's impulsive, counterproductive
misadventures. By the time of Khashoggi's shocking demise inside the
kingdom's Istanbul consulate last year, it had become clear that the
hands-off, highly transactional approach to managing the Saudis pursued
by Trump and his son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, had gone
badly astray. Giving Mohammed bin Salman carte blanche to indulge his
darkest instincts in exchange for a few billion dollars in weapons
purchases, lower oil prices, and a slightly less hostile attitude toward
an otherwise doomed U.S. plan for Middle East peace was neither a wise
nor sustainable trade-off for U.S. foreign policy.

### AT: This relationship is unethical

#### That's not very a nuanced claim -- strategic interests matter and there are ethical implications of collapsing the relationship as well

**Stephens and Juneau, 2016**

(Michael and Thomas, "Saudi Arabia: Why We Need This Flawed Ally," 25
Sept. 2016,
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/saudi-arabia-why-we-need-flawed-ally>)

The United States -- or any other Western state -- does not have much
leverage on Saudi Arabia and its strategic choices at present. But **[to
shun the Saudis at a time when they are trying to assert themselves as
regional leaders would be highly destabilising to the Middle East's
increasingly fragile regional order]{.underline}**. Given that
**[Riyadh]{.underline}**'s insecurity would be heightened by the absence
of a security partner with which to face down Tehran, this
**[would]{.underline}** force it to **[look to Beijing and Moscow
as]{.underline}** grateful, yet uncritical **[allies]{.underline}**.
**[Realistically the best]{.underline}** -- or least bad -- **[option is
to maintain engagement with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. At a time when
the Kingdom has begun to reach out more, **[now is]{.underline}**
perhaps **[the best moment to try to shape its long-term
thinking]{.underline}**. Vision 2030, championed by Prince Mohammed, has
pushed the Kingdom to not only seek business opportunities abroad in the
pursuit of economic diversification, but also to build its capacities
through training and intellectual engagement with policy communities and
academic institutions in the West. **[A serious attempt to understand
the Kingdom's strategic rationale offers scope to try to shape its
decisions]{.underline}**, and opens the door to mitigate the costs of
some of its actions. **[In the difficult case of]{.underline}** Riyadh's
war with **[Yemen, the only realistic alternative is]{.underline}**
therefore **[for Washington to accept that the war will continue while
attempting]{.underline}** -- with, at best, only odds of limited success
-- **[to temper Saudi ambitions and steer conversations at the
negotiating table]{.underline}** toward a more successful outcome. In
sum, **[it is better to be close to Saudi Arabia when it makes decisions
unpalatable to the West, and thus to have the opportunity to understand
its rationale and perhaps shape its actions. To be more distant
would]{.underline}** bring a certain **[moral gratification, but would
only provoke further Saudi actions counter to U.S.
interests]{.underline}**. This is unsatisfactory. But no amount of
American power can prevent the Riyadh-Tehran rivalry from spilling out
across the region. **[Working to contain tension and to ensure that
conflict does not escalate into a region-wide conflagration that further
damages the Middle East is surely preferable to losing the limited
available leverage by walking away]{.underline}**. This does not mean
uncritically accepting all of Riyadh's concerns and systematically
aligning with every actor favorable to the Kingdom. But a good step in
the right direction would be to take a more robust stance on the role on
non-state actors across the region by clearly defining which actors
Washington is willing to tolerate as challenges to the status quo and
which are too damaging to be allowed to proliferate. This would send the
message to Riyadh that Washington seeks stability as an end goal of its
regional policy. More than anything, this would calm nerves in the Saudi
ruling house.

## Impacts

### Generic/Global Wars

#### The impact is terrorism and global wars -- oil is *[the thing]{.underline}* countries start wars and escalate over

**Klare, 2014**

(Michael T. -professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire
College," Twenty-first century energy wars: how oil and gas are fuelling
global conflicts, Energy Post, 15 July 2014,
<https://energypost.eu/twenty-first-century-energy-wars-oil-gas-fuelling-global-conflicts/>)

**[Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, South Sudan, Ukraine, the East and South China
Seas:]{.underline}** wherever you look, **[the world is aflame with new
or intensifying conflicts.]{.underline}** At first glance, these
upheavals appear to be independent events, driven by their own unique
and idiosyncratic circumstances. But look more closely and they share
several key characteristics -- notably, a witch's brew of ethnic,
religious, and national **[antagonisms]{.underline}** that have **[been
stirred to the boiling point by a fixation on energy]{.underline}**. In
each of these conflicts, the fighting is driven in large part by the
eruption of long-standing historic antagonisms among neighboring (often
intermingled) tribes, sects, and peoples. In Iraq and Syria, it is a
clash among Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, Turkmen, and others; in Nigeria,
among Muslims, Christians, and assorted tribal groupings; in South
Sudan, between the Dinka and Nuer; in Ukraine, between Ukrainian
loyalists and Russian-speakers aligned with Moscow; in the East and
South China Sea, among the Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipinos, and
others. **[It would be easy to attribute all this to age-old
hatreds]{.underline}**, as suggested by many analysts;
**[but]{.underline}** while such hostilities do help drive these
conflicts, **[they are fueled by]{.underline}** a most modern impulse as
well: the desire to control valuable **[oil]{.underline}** and natural
gas assets. Make no mistake about it: **[these are twenty-first-century
energy wars.]{.underline}** It should surprise no one that energy plays
such a significant role in these conflicts. **[Oil and gas
are]{.underline}**, after all, **[the world's most]{.underline}**
important and **[valuable commodities and constitute a major source of
income for the governments and corporations that control their
production and distribution]{.underline}**. Indeed, the governments of
[Iraq](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=IZ),
[Nigeria](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=NI),
[Russia](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=RS), [South
Sudan](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=SU), and
[Syria](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=SY)derive the great
bulk of their revenues from oil sales, while the major energy firms
(many state-owned) exercise immense power in these and the other
countries involved. Whoever controls these states, or the oil- and
gas-producing areas within them, also controls the collection and
allocation of crucial revenues. Despite the patina of historical
enmities, many of these conflicts, then, are really struggles for
control over the principal source of national income. Moreover, **[we
live in an [energy-centric
world](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175487/) where control over
oil]{.underline}** and gas resources (and their means of delivery**[)
translates into geopolitical clout for some and economic vulnerability
for others. Because so many countries are dependent on energy imports,
nations with surpluses to export]{.underline}** -- including Iraq,
Nigeria, Russia, and South Sudan -- often **[exercise disproportionate
influence]{.underline}** on the world stage. What happens in these
countries sometimes matters as much to the rest of us as to the people
living in them, and **[so the risk of external involvement in their
conflicts]{.underline}** -- whether in the form of direct
**[intervention, arms transfers]{.underline}**, the sending in of
**[military advisers]{.underline}**, or economic assistance -- **[is
greater]{.underline}** than almost anywhere else. The struggle over
energy resources has been a conspicuous factor in many recent conflicts,
including the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988, the Gulf War of 1990-1991, and
the Sudanese Civil War of 1983-2005. On first glance, the fossil-fuel
factor in the most recent outbreaks of tension and fighting may seem
less evident. But look more closely and you'll see that each of these
conflicts is, at heart, an energy war. Iraq, Syria, and ISIS The Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria
([**[ISIS]{.underline}**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24179084)),
the Sunni extremist group that controls large chunks of western Syria
and northern Iraq, is a well-armed militia intent on creating an Islamic
caliphate in the areas it controls. In some respects, it is a fanatical,
sectarian religious organization, seeking to reproduce the pure,
uncorrupted piety of the early Islamic era. At the same time, it **[is
engaged in a]{.underline}** conventional **[[nation-building
project](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/world/middleeast/rebels-fast-strike-in-iraq-was-years-in-the-making.html),]{.underline}**
seeking to create a fully functioning state with all its attributes. As
the United States learned to its dismay in Iraq and Afghanistan,
**[nation-building is expensive]{.underline}**: institutions must be
created and financed, armies recruited and paid, weapons and fuel
procured, and infrastructure maintained. **[Without oil]{.underline}**
(or some other lucrative source of income), **[ISIS could
never]{.underline}** hope to a**[ccomplish its]{.underline}** ambitious
**[goals]{.underline}**. However, as it now occupies key oil-producing
areas of Syria and oil-refining facilities in Iraq, it is in a unique
position to do so. **[Oil]{.underline}**, then, **[is absolutely
essential to the organization]{.underline}**'s grand strategy. Without
oil, ISIS could never hope to accomplish its ambitious goals. Syria was
never a major oil producer, but its pre-war production of some [400,000
barrels](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=SY) per day
did provide the regime of Bashar al-Assad with a major source of income.
Now, **[most of the country's oil fields are under the control
of]{.underline}** rebel groups, including **[ISIS]{.underline}**, the
al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and local Kurdish militias. Although
production from the fields has dropped significantly, enough is being
extracted and sold through various clandestine channels to [provide the
rebels](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/world/middleeast/rebels-in-syria-claim-control-of-resources.html)
with income and operating funds. "Syria is an oil country and has
resources, but in the past they were all stolen by the regime,"
[said](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/world/middleeast/rebels-in-syria-claim-control-of-resources.html)
Abu Nizar, an anti-government activist. "Now they are being stolen by
those who are profiting from the revolution." At first, many rebel
groups were
[involved](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/middleeast/syrias-oil-a-source-of-contention-for-competing-groups.htm)
in these extractive activities, but since January, when it assumed
control of [Raqqa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raqqa), the capital of
the province of that name, ISIS has been the dominant player in the oil
fields. In addition, it has seized fields in neighboring Deir al-Zour
Province along the Iraq border. Indeed, many of the U.S.-supplied
weapons it acquired from the fleeing Iraqi army after its recent drive
into Mosul and other northern Iraqi cities have been [moved
into](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/isis-iraq-syria-two-wars-one-nightmare)
Deir al-Zour to help in the organization's campaign to take full control
of the region. In Iraq, ISIS is fighting to gain control over Iraq's
largest refinery at
[Baiji](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27917824) in the
central part of the country. It appears that ISIS [sells
oil](http://www.syriadirect.org/main/36-interviews/1114-oil-sales-fuel-rebel-groups-in-eastern-syria)
from the fields it controls to shadowy middlemen who in turn arrange for
its transport -- mostly by tanker trucks -- to buyers in Iraq, Syria,
and Turkey. These sales are [said to
provide](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/21/world/middleeast/isis-iraq-insurgents-reaping-wealth-as-they-advance.html)
the organization with the funds needed to pay its troops and acquire its
vast stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Many observers also claim that
ISIS is selling oil to the Assad regime in return for immunity from
government air strikes of the sort being launched against other rebel
groups. "Many locals in Raqqa accuse ISIS of collaborating with the
Syrian regime," a Kurdish journalist, Sirwan Kajjo,
[reported](http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/06/03/fight-for-raqqa/hcgh)
in early June. "Locals say that while other rebel groups in Raqqa have
been under attack by regime air strikes on a regular basis, ISIS
headquarters have not once been attacked." However the present fighting
in northern Iraq plays out, it is obvious that there, too, oil is a
central factor. ISIS seeks both to deny petroleum supplies and oil
revenue to the Baghdad government and to bolster its own coffers,
enhancing its capacity for nation-building and further military
advances. At the same time, the Kurds and various Sunni tribes --- some
allied with ISIS --- want control over oil fields located in the areas
under their control and a [greater
share](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175860/) of the nation's oil
wealth. Ukraine, the Crimea, and Russia The present crisis in Ukraine
[began](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/middleeast/syrias-oil-a-source-of-contention-for-competing-groups.html)
in November 2013 when President [Viktor
Yanukovych](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanukovych) repudiated an
agreement for closer economic and political ties with the European Union
(EU), opting instead for closer ties with Russia. That act touched off
fierce [anti-government
protests](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25182823) in Kiev and
eventually led to Yanukovych's flight from the capital. With Moscow's
principal ally pushed from the scene and pro-EU forces in control of the
capital, Russian President Vladimir **[Putin moved to seize control of
the Crimea and foment a separatist drive in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}**. For both sides, **[the]{.underline}** resulting
**[struggle has been about]{.underline}** political legitimacy and
national identity -- but as in other recent conflicts, it has also been
about **[energy]{.underline}**. **[By annexing the Crimea, Russia
virtually doubled the offshore territory it controls in the Black Sea,
which is thought to house billions of barrels of oil]{.underline}** and
vast reserves of natural gas. **[Ukraine is]{.underline}** not itself a
significant energy producer. It is, however, **[a [major transit
route](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=UP)]{.underline}**
for the delivery of Russian natural gas to Europe. According to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration (EIA), Europe
[obtained](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15411) 30% of
its gas from Russia in 2013 -- most of it from the state-controlled gas
giant [Gazprom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazprom) -- and
approximately half of this was transported by pipelines crossing
Ukraine. As a result, that country plays a critical role in the [complex
energy
relationship](https://csis.org/publication/russia-eu-gas-relationship-partnership-necessity)
between Europe and Russia, one that has proved incredibly lucrative for
the shadowy elites and oligarchs who control the flow of gas, while at
the same time provoking intense controversy.
[Disputes](http://www.cfr.org/ukraine/business-politics-behind-russia-ukraine-gas-dispute/p18178)
over the price Ukraine pays for its own imports of Russian gas twice
provoked a cut-off in deliveries by Gazprom, leading to diminished
supplies in Europe as well. Given this background, it is not surprising
that a key objective of the "[association
agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93European_Union_Association_Agreement)"
between the EU and Ukraine that was repudiated by Yanukovych (and has
now been signed by the new Ukrainian government) calls for the extension
of EU energy rules to Ukraine's energy system -- essentially eliminating
the cozy deals between Ukrainian elites and Gazprom. By entering into
the agreement, EU officials
[claim](http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/ukraine/eu_ukraine/association_agreement/index_en.htm),
Ukraine will begin "a process of approximating its energy legislation to
the EU norms and standards, thus facilitating internal market reforms."
Russian leaders have many reasons to despise the association agreement.
For one thing, it will move Ukraine, a country on its border, into a
closer political and economic embrace with the West. Of special concern,
however, are the provisions about energy, given Russia's economic
reliance on gas sales to Europe -- not to mention the threat they pose
to the personal fortunes of well-connected Russian elites. In late 2013
Yanukovych came [under immense
pressure](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraine-under-pressure-from-russia-puts-brakes-on-eu-deal/2013/11/21/46c50796-52c9-11e3-9ee6-2580086d8254_story.html)
from Vladimir Putin to turn his back on the EU and agree instead to an
economic union with Russia and Belarus, an arrangement that would have
protected the privileged status of elites in both countries. However, by
moving in this direction, Yanukovych put a bright spotlight on the
[crony
politics](http://csis.org/blog/russia%E2%80%99s-gas-clash-ukraine-geopolitics-or-just-money)
that had long plagued Ukraine's energy system, thereby triggering
protests in Kiev's Independence Square (the
[Maidan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan)) -- that led to his
downfall. Once the protests began, a cascade of events led to the
current standoff, with the Crimea in Russian hands, large parts of the
east under the control of pro-Russian separatists, and the rump western
areas moving ever closer to the EU. In this ongoing struggle, identity
politics has come to play a prominent role, with leaders on all sides
appealing to national and ethnic loyalties. **[Energy]{.underline}**,
nevertheless, **[remains a major factor]{.underline}** in the equation.
**[Gazprom has repeatedly [raised the
price](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/world/europe/russia-ratchets-up-ukraines-gas-bills-in-shift-to-an-economic-battlefield.html)
it charges Ukraine for its imp]{.underline}**orts of natural gas, and on
June 16th [cut
off](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/world/europe/russia-gazprom-increases-pressure-on-ukraine-in-gas-dispute.html)
its supply entirely, claiming non-payment for past deliveries. A day
later, an explosion
[damaged](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27891018) one of the main
pipelines carrying Russian gas to Ukraine -- an event still being
investigated. Negotiations over the gas price remain a major issue in
the ongoing negotiations between Ukraine's newly elected president,
Petro Poroshenko, and Vladimir Putin. Energy also played a key role in
Russia's determination to take the Crimea by military means. By annexing
that region, Russia virtually
[doubled](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/world/europe/in-taking-crimea-putin-gains-a-sea-of-fuel-reserves.html)
the offshore territory it controls in the Black Sea, which is thought to
house billions of barrels of oil and vast reserves of natural gas. Prior
to the crisis, several Western oil firms, including ExxonMobil, were
[negotiating](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/shifting-energy-trends-blunt-russias-natural-gas-weapon/2014/02/28/7d090062-9ef7-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html)
with Ukraine for access to those reserves. Now, they will be negotiating
with Moscow. "It's a big deal,"
[said](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/world/europe/in-taking-crimea-putin-gains-a-sea-of-fuel-reserves.html)Carol
Saivetz, a Eurasian expert at MIT. "It deprives Ukraine of the
possibility of developing these resources and gives them to Russia."
Nigeria and South Sudan **[The conflicts in South Sudan and
Nigeria]{.underline}** are distinctive in many respects, yet both
**[share]{.underline}** a key common factor: widespread anger and
distrust towards **[government officials who have become]{.underline}**
wealthy, corrupt, and autocratic **[thanks to]{.underline}** access to
abundant **[oil]{.underline}** revenues. With oil selling at around
\$100 per barrel, this represents a potentially staggering source of
wealth for Nigeria \[...\] Were these revenues -- estimated in the tens
of billions of dollars per year -- used to spur development \[...\]
Nigeria could be a great beacon of hope for Africa. In Nigeria, the
insurgent group [Boko
Haram](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13809501) is fighting to
overthrow the existing political system and establish a puritanical,
Muslim-ruled state. Although most Nigerians decry the group's violent
methods (including the kidnapping of hundreds of teenage girls from a
state-run school), it has [drawn
strength](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/11/northern-nigeria/verini-text)
from disgust in the poverty-stricken northern part of the country with
the
[corruption-riddled](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2387359/Nigeria-country-corrupt-better-burn-aid-money.html)
central government in distant Abuja, the capital. Nigeria is the largest
oil producer in Africa, [pumping
out](http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=ni) some 2.5 million
barrels per day. With oil selling at around \$100 per barrel, this
represents a potentially staggering source of wealth for the nation,
even after the private companies involved in the day-to-day extractive
operations take their share. Were these revenues -- estimated in the
tens of billions of dollars per year -- used to spur development and
improve the lot of the population, Nigeria could be a great beacon of
hope for Africa. Instead, much of the money
[disappears](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26535530) into the
pockets (and foreign bank accounts) of Nigeria's well-connected elites.
In February, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Lamido Sanusi,
told a parliamentary investigating committee that the state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had failed to transfer
some \$20 billion in proceeds from oil sales to the national treasury,
as required by law. It had all evidently been diverted to private
accounts. "A substantial amount of money has gone," he
[told](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/world/africa/nigerians-ask-why-oil-funds-are-missing.html)
the New York Times. "I wasn't just talking about numbers. I showed it
was a scam." **[For]{.underline}** many **[Nigerians]{.underline}** -- a
majority of whom subsist on less than \$2 per day -- the
**[corruption]{.underline}** in Abuja, when combined with the [wanton
brutality](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/14/how-nigeria-s-stupidly-brutal-cops-botch-the-hunt-for-boko-haram.html)
of the government's security forces, **[is a source of]{.underline}**
abiding **[anger]{.underline}** and resentment, **[generating recruits
for insurgent groups]{.underline}** like Boko Haram and winning them
begrudging admiration. "They know well the frustration that would drive
someone to take up arms against the state,"
[said](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/11/northern-nigeria/verini-text)
National Geographic reporter James Verini of people he interviewed in
battle-scarred areas of northern Nigeria. At this stage, the government
has displayed [zero
capacity](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/world/africa/nigeria-shows-its-weakness.html)
to overcome the insurgency, while its ineptitude and heavy-handed
military tactics have only further alienated ordinary Nigerians. The
conflict in [South Sudan](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14069082)
has different roots, but shares a common link to energy. Indeed, **[the
very formation of South Sudan is a product of oil
politics]{.underline}**. A [civil
war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sudanese_Civil_War) in Sudan
that lasted from 1955 to 1972 only ended when the Muslim-dominated
government in the north agreed to grant more autonomy to the peoples of
the southern part of the country, largely practitioners of traditional
African religions or Christianity. However, when oil was discovered in
the south, the rulers of northern Sudan repudiated many of their earlier
promises and sought to gain control over the oil fields, sparking a
[second civil
war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sudanese_Civil_War), which
lasted from 1983 to 2005. An estimated two million people lost their
lives in this round of fighting. In the end, the south was
[granted](http://www.enoughproject.org/blogs/sudan-comprehensive-peace-agreement-and-south-sudan-independence)
full autonomy and the right to vote on secession. Following a January
2011 referendum in which
[98.8%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12317927) of southerners
voted to secede, the country became independent on that July 9th. The
very formation of South Sudan is a product of oil politics. The new
state had barely been established, however, when conflict with the north
over its oil resumed. While South Sudan has a plethora of oil, the only
pipeline allowing the country to export its energy stretches across
North Sudan to the Red Sea. This ensured that the south would be
dependent on the north for the major source of government revenues.
Furious at the loss of the fields, the northerners
[charged](http://sudanreeves.org/2012/01/25/sudan-south-sudan-and-the-oil-revenues-controversy-khartoums-obstructionism-threatens-war/)
excessively high rates for transporting the oil, precipitating a cut-off
in oil deliveries by the south and sporadic violence along the two
countries' still-disputed border. Finally, in August 2012, the two sides
[agreed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/south-sudan/9452032/Sudan-and-South-Sudan-reach-agreement-over-oil-after-tense-eight-month-dispute.html)
to a formula for sharing the wealth and the flow of oil resumed.
Fighting has, however, continued in certain border areas controlled by
the north but populated by groups linked to the south. With the flow of
oil income assured, the leader of South Sudan, President [Salva
Kiir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva_Kiir), sought to consolidate
his control over the country and all those oil revenues. Claiming an
imminent coup attempt by his rivals, led by Vice President [Riek
Machar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riek_Machar), he
[disbanded](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-23428557) his
multiethnic government on July 24, 2013, and began arresting allies of
Machar. The resulting power struggle quickly turned into an [ethnic
civil
war](http://www.enoughproject.org/conflicts/sudans/conflicts-south-sudan),
with the kin of President Kiir, a Dinka, battling members of the Nuer
group, of which Machar is a member. Despite several attempts to
negotiate a cease-fire,
[fighting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudanese_conflict_%282013%E2%80%932014%29)
has been under way since December, with thousands of people killed and
hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes. **[As in Syria and
Iraq, much of the fighting in South Sudan has centered
around]{.underline}** the vital **[oil]{.underline}** fields,
**[with]{.underline}** both sides **[determined to
control]{.underline}** them and collect the **[revenues]{.underline}**
they generate. As of March, while still under government control, the
Paloch field in Upper Nile State was
[producing](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-30/south-sudan-s-rebel-leader-machar-vows-to-target-key-oil-fields.html)
some 150,000 barrels a day, worth about \$15 million to the government
and participating oil companies. The rebel forces, led by former Vice
President Machar, are trying to seize those fields to deny this revenue
to the government. "The presence of forces loyal to Salva Kiir in
Paloch, to buy more arms to kill our people... is not acceptable to us,"
Machar
[said](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/world/africa/from-a-quiet-rebel-base-plotting-an-assault-on-south-sudans-oil-fields.html)
in April. "We want to take control of the oil field. It's our oil." As
of now, the field remains in government hands, with rebel forces
reportedly making gains in the vicinity. **[The South China
Sea]{.underline}** In both the [East
China](http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=ecs) and
[South China](http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=scs)
seas, China and its neighbors claim assorted atolls and islands that sit
astride vast undersea oil and gas reserves. The **[waters]{.underline}**
of both **[have been the site of recurring naval clashes]{.underline}**
over the past few years, with the South China Sea recently grabbing the
spotlight. An energy-rich offshoot of the western Pacific, that sea,
long a focus of
[contention](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349), is
rimmed by China, Vietnam, the island of Borneo, and the Philippine
Islands. **[Tensions peaked]{.underline}** in May **[when the Chinese
[deployed](http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/chinas-oil-rig-gambit-south-china-sea-game-changer/)
their]{.underline}** largest **[deepwater drilling rig]{.underline}**,
the HD-981, in waters claimed by Vietnam. Once in the drilling area,
about 120 nautical miles off the coast of Vietnam, the Chinese
surrounded the HD-981 with a large flotilla of navy and coast guard
ships. When **[Vietnamese coast guard vessels]{.underline}** attempted
to penetrate this defensive ring in an effort to drive off the rig, they
**[were
[rammed](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/27/world/asia/vietnam-china-paracels-fishing-boat-collision/)
by Chinese ships]{.underline}** and pummeled by water cannon. No lives
have yet been lost in these encounters, but [anti-Chinese
rioting](http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/19/world/asia/china-vietnam-islands-oil-rig-explainer/)
in Vietnam in response to the sea-borne encroachment left several dead
and the clashes at sea are expected to continue for several months until
the Chinese move the rig to another (possibly equally contested)
location. To view the Chinese drive in the South China Sea as a simple
matter of nationalistic impulses would be a mistake. The riots and
clashes sparked by the deployment of HD-981 have been driven in large
part by
[nationalism](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349) and
resentment over past humiliations. The Chinese, insisting that various
tiny islands in the South China Sea were once ruled by their country,
still seek to overcome the territorial losses and humiliations they
suffered at the hands the Western powers and Imperial Japan. The
Vietnamese, long accustomed to Chinese invasions, seek to protect what
they view as their sovereign territory. For common citizens in both
countries, demonstrating resolve in the dispute is a matter of national
pride. But **[to view the Chinese drive in the South China Sea as a
simple matter of nationalistic impulses would be a
mistake.]{.underline}** The owner of HD-981, the China National Offshore
Oil Company
([CNOOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Offshore_Oil_Corporation)),
has conducted extensive seismic testing in the disputed area and
evidently believes there is a large reservoir of energy there. "The
South China Sea is estimated to have 23 billion tons to 30 billion tons
of oil and 16 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, accounting for
one-third of China's total oil and gas resources," the Chinese news
agency Xinhua
[noted](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-05/09/c_131576610.htm).
Moreover, China
[announced](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/world/asia/china-plans-to-send-second-oil-rig-to-waters-near-vietnam.html)
in June that it was deploying a second drilling rig to the contested
waters of the South China Sea, this time at the mouth of the Gulf of
Tonkin. **[As the world's biggest consumer of energy,
[China](http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=CH) is
desperate to acquire fresh fossil fuel supplies]{.underline}** wherever
it can. Although its leaders are prepared to make [increasingly
large](http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2014-02/06/content_17269251.htm)
purchases of African, Russian, and Middle Eastern oil and gas to satisfy
the nation's growing energy requirements, they not surprisingly prefer
to develop and exploit domestic supplies. For them, the South China Sea
is not a "foreign" source of energy but a Chinese one, and they appear
determined to use whatever means necessary to secure it. Because [other
countries](http://www.eia.gov/countries/regions-topics.cfm?fips=scs),
including Vietnam and the Philippines, also seek to exploit these oil
and gas reserves, further clashes, at increasing levels of violence,
seem almost inevitable. No End to Fighting As these conflicts and others
like them suggest, fighting for control over key energy assets or the
distribution of **[oil]{.underline}** revenues **[is a [critical
factor](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175540/) in]{.underline}** most
**[contemporary warfare]{.underline}**. While ethnic and religious
divisions may provide the political and ideological fuel for these
battles, **[it is the potential for mammoth oil profits that keeps the
struggles alive]{.underline}**. Without the promise of such resources,
many of these conflicts would eventually die out for lack of funds to
buy arms and pay troops. So long as the oil keeps flowing, however, the
belligerents have both the means and incentive to keep fighting. In a
fossil-fuel world, **[control over oil]{.underline}** and gas reserves
**[is an essential component of national power. "Oil fuels more than
automobiles]{.underline}** and airplanes," Robert Ebel of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies
[told](http://2001-2009.state.gov/s/p/of/proc/tr/10187.htm) a State
Department audience in 2002. "**[Oil fuels]{.underline}** military
power, national treasuries, and international
**[politics]{.underline}**." Far more than an ordinary trade commodity,
"**[it is a determinant of well being]{.underline}**, of national
security, and international power for those who possess this vital
resource, and the converse for those who do not." If anything, that's
even truer today, and as energy wars expand, the truth of this will only
become more evident. **[Someday, perhaps, the development of renewable
sources of energy may invalidate this dictum. But in our present world,
if you see a conflict developing, look for the energy]{.underline}**.
It'll be there somewhere on this fossil-fueled planet of ours.

#### #1 cause of war 

-history

-resource wars

-miscalculation

**Colgan, 2013**

(Jeff D., "Oil, Conflict, and U.S. National Interests," Harvard Kennedy
School Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Oct. 2013,
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/oil-conflict-and-us-national-interests>)

Although the threat of \"resource wars\" over possession of oil reserves
is often exaggerated, **[the sum total of the political effects
generated by the oil industry makes oil a leading cause of
war]{.underline}**. Between one-quarter and one-**[half of interstate
wars]{.underline}** since 1973 **[have been connected to]{.underline}**
one or more **[oil]{.underline}**-related causal mechanisms. No other
commodity has had such an impact on international security. The
influence of oil on conflict is often poorly understood. In U.S. public
debates about the 1991 and 2003 Iraq wars, both sides focused
excessively on the question of whether the United States was fighting
for possession of oil reserves; neither sought a broader understanding
of how **[oil shaped the preconditions for war. Oil fuels international
conflict through]{.underline}** eight distinct mechanisms: (1)
**[resource wars,]{.underline}** in which states try to acquire oil
reserves by force; (2) **[petro-aggression]{.underline}**, whereby oil
insulates aggressive leaders such as Saddam Hussein or Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini from domestic opposition, and therefore makes them
more willing to engage in risky foreign policy adventurism; (3) the
externalization of civil wars in oil-producing states (\"petrostates\");
(4) financing for insurgencies---for instance, Iran funneling oil money
to Hezbollah; (5) conflicts triggered by the prospect of **[oil-market
domination]{.underline}**, such as the United States\' war with Iraq
over Kuwait in 1991; (6) **[clashes over control of]{.underline}** oil
transit routes, such as **[shipping lanes]{.underline}** and pipelines;
(7) **[oil-related grievances]{.underline}**, whereby the presence of
foreign workers in petrostates helps extremist groups such as al-Qaida
recruit locals; **[and (8) oil-related obstacles to multilateral
cooperation,]{.underline}** such as when an importer\'s attempt to curry
favor with a petrostate prevents multilateral cooperation on security
issues. **[These]{.underline}** mechanisms can **[contribute to conflict
individually or in combination]{.underline}**. The **[linkages between
oil and international conflict are growing increasingly
important]{.underline}** in light of three transitions under way in
global energy markets. The first is the shift in patterns of global oil
production away from traditional suppliers in the Middle East and toward
(1) suppliers of unconventional oil reserves in North America and (2)
new suppliers of conventional oil, especially in Africa. As many as
sixteen developing countries will become oil exporters in the near
future, creating a swath of new international security concerns. Second,
the low oil prices of the 1990s have given way to higher and more
volatile prices, increasing the magnitude of the consequences one can
expect from oil-conflict linkages. Third, the relative decline of U.S.
hegemony may reduce the provision of public goods such as security of
shipping lanes and pipelines. Although these transitions alter some of
the ways in which the oil industry contributes to international
conflict, none eliminates linkages between the two or allows the United
States to disengage from global markets. The Role of Fracking
Understanding the eight mechanisms linking oil to international security
can help policymakers think beyond the much-discussed goal of energy
security, defined as reliable access to affordable fuel supplies.
Achieving such an understanding is important in light of recent changes
in the United States. As hydraulic fracturing---\"fracking\"---of shale
oil and gas accelerates, energy imports are projected to decline, and
North America could even achieve energy independence, in the sense of
low or zero net overall energy imports, in the next decade. Yet the
United States will continue to import large volumes of oil, and the
world price of oil will continue to affect it. Moreover, so long as the
rest of the world remains dependent on global oil markets, the fracking
revolution will do little to reduce many oil-related threats to
international security. The emergence of aggressive, revolutionary
leaders in petrostates would likely continue to pose threats to regional
security. Petrostates will continue to be weakly institutionalized and
thus subject to civil wars, creating the kind of security problems that
demand responses by the international community, as occurred in Libya in
2011. Petro-financed insurgent groups such as Hezbollah will persist, as
will threats to the shipping lanes and oil transit routes that supply
important U.S. allies, such as Japan. In sum, energy autarky is not the
answer. Self-sufficiency will bring economic benefits to the United
States, but few gains for national security. So long as the oil market
remains globally integrated, national oil imports matter far less than
total consumption. Rather than viewing energy self-sufficiency as a
panacea, the United States should contribute to international security
by making long-term investments in research and development to reduce
oil consumption and provide alternative fuel sources in the
transportation sector. In addition to the economic and environmental
benefits of reducing oil consumption, substantial evidence exists that
military and security benefits will accrue from such investments.
Unexpected Sources of Conflict Policymakers must also think
systematically about oil-security linkages when monitoring emerging
security threats as the global oil industry transforms itself. With
sixteen additional countries potentially exporting oil in the near
future, **[new international dynamics will materialize]{.underline}**,
especially in Africa. Furthermore, **[if oil prices remain high,
incentives for resource grabs will grow]{.underline}**. Resource wars
are most likely to occur in unpopulated territories or naval zones, as
oil can be extracted from these areas without the need to manage a
populated, potentially hostile territory. Thus, policymakers should be
most concerned about disputed territories in the East China and South
China Seas and naval borders in the Caspian Sea. **[There are already
competing sovereignty claims]{.underline}** to territory **[in those
regions]{.underline}**, and considerable uncertainty about the magnitude
of the energy resources located there, **[creating conditions ripe for
miscalculation]{.underline}** and mutual suspicion. Policymakers should
be especially concerned about security threats that arise from
unexpected sources, such as allies\' energy needs or **[seemingly benign
actions]{.underline}** that **[prompt hostile responses from
rivals]{.underline}**. Conclusion Appreciating the eight ways in which
oil contributes to war can help policymakers design grand strategy,
allocate military resources, and shape domestic energy policy. **[Policy
analysts]{.underline}** tend to **[focus too narrowly on \"energy
security]{.underline}**\" as defined only by reliable access to fuel
supplies, **[while missing the broader relationships between energy and
security]{.underline}**. Only by thinking systematically about the
oil-conflict relationship can they craft intelligent foreign policy.

### Econ/ME War 

#### Shocks collapse the global economy, fuel terrorism, and cause Middle East wars

**Jaffe and Elass, 2016**

(Amy Meyers and Jareer, "War and the Oil Price Cycle," 1 Jan 2016,
<https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/war-oil-price-cycle>)

**[Oil has shaped international conflict for decades]{.underline}**.
According to one estimate, twenty-five to fifty percent of interstate
wars between 1973 and 2012 had oil-related linkages. 1 But the cyclical
nature of oil's contribution to global conflict is not well understood.
Not only are oil prices cyclical, **[but the geopolitics of oil are
linked inexorably to]{.underline}** the same boom and bust
**[price]{.underline}** cycle. **[Military adventurism, proxy wars and
regional pathologies in the Middle East expand and contract
with]{.underline}** the ebb and flow of massive petrodollar
accumulations related to **[the]{.underline}** oil **[price
cycle.]{.underline}** The **[massive inflow of petrodollar revenues when
oil prices are high creates disposable incomes that can be easily
dispensed on regional arms races]{.underline}**, especially since oil
consuming countries like the United States are incentivized to increase
arms sales as a means of solving oil import related trade deficits.
Besides transferring wealth from industrialized countries to oil
producers in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region and Russia
(and stimulating renewed drilling for oil and gas in North America),
**[high]{.underline}** global **[oil]{.underline}** and natural gas
**[prices also slow global economic growth and encourage energy
conservation. This causes petro]{.underline}**leum **[demand to
slow]{.underline}** globally, **[lowering oil prices. Social and
political problems in the region reemerge as oil prices
recede.]{.underline}** Regional governments have fewer resources to
spend on restive populations that have become accustomed to generous
handouts enabled by high oil prices. Job creation and visible social
programs slow, dissatisfaction rises, and **[the consequences of
economic downturns incite support for militants]{.underline}**. Ensuing
**[instability forces governments to use]{.underline}** newly purchased
**[arms, which ironically begins the cycle yet again, as new conflicts
disrupt oil supplies]{.underline}**. In this manner, the world
experiences perpetuating patterns of military conflict, followed by oil
supply crises, and accompanying global financial instability. In effect,
**[the Middle East resource curse has become globalized. The
challenges]{.underline}** this is presenting on humanitarian, security
and economic fronts **[have become increasingly
dangerous.]{.underline}** The arms race that has accompanied the rise of
oil prices over the 2000s has been no exception and is now all the more
complicated due to the violent participation of sub-national radicalized
groups that are less susceptible to diplomatic pressures or initiatives.
In this emerging geopolitical context, the rise of violent subnational
groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda are increasingly putting oil
infrastructure at risk, laying the groundwork for a future oil crisis
that may prove harder to solve than in the past. As borders and ruling
institutions have become contested, so has control of the region's major
oil and gas facilities. Initially an outgrowth of disunity inside Iraq,
the conflict over oil and gas facilities is now accelerating across
ungoverned territories, with important long-term consequences for global
energy markets. Mideast oil and gas production capacity, along with
surface facilities, are increasingly being damaged in ways that will
make them hard to repair. Export disruptions, which were once sporadic,
are becoming a more permanent feature of the civil war landscape. The
level of destroyed capacity is currently estimated at about 2 million
b/d and rising.2 The longer Mideast conflicts fester, the more that
infrastructure could become at risk. There is an additional element to
this oil and war story that links structurally with the oil boom and
bust cycle. As oil prices recede, along with a decreased demand for oil
and accelerating regional conflict, **[wealthy oil producers such as
Saudi Arabia,]{.underline}** the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait,
**[are often tempted to use large oil production capacity as a strategic
asset]{.underline}**. They flood the market with increased supplies in
order to lower prices, thereby hurting geopolitical rivals. **[This
price war strategy]{.underline}**, which was notably present during the
prolonged Soviet war in Afghanistan and the eight year Iran-Iraq War,
temporarily ameliorates the short run effects of war on surface export
facilities through excessive production rates. In addition, it lays the
seeds for the future uptick in the oil market, by discouraging
investment in future oil productive capacity outside the Middle East
when prices are extremely low. In the case of the 2000s, the destruction
caused by ISIS on the oil sector in many locations around the Middle
East, combined with expected losses in investment in other parts of the
world (like Canada's oil sands and the Arctic due to current low oil
prices), may be creating the conditions for a future oil supply crunch.
This **[has major implications]{.underline}** on U.S. policy. This
article asserts that the United State would be, in light of these
circumstances in the Middle East, unwise to dismantle its Strategic
Petroleum Reserve (SPR) as has been suggested on Capitol Hill. It would
be similarly unwise for the United States to lose focus on the
importance of conservation efforts in the transportation sector which
has both national security and climate benefits. The United States would
benefit strategically from a reevaluation of its ban on oil exports.
Finally, the United States should place a greater emphasis on conflict
resolution in troubled states. By resolving internal conflicts over the
distribution of oil revenues, the United States can better pave the way
for long-term solutions whereby those same revenues can be integrated
into national budgets in ways that brings economic prosperity to
populations instead of rising military expenditure. WAR AND THE OIL
CYCLE Over the past four decades, oil prices have been governed by a
combination of the real business cycle and the boom and bust investment
cycles of oil exploration and production (E&P). As economies expand
during upswings in the business cycle, oil demand rises in parallel,
often fueling fears that shortages will occur.3 **[Oil
prices]{.underline}** then **[rise]{.underline}**, generally **[in
combination with irrational exuberance and market
bubbles]{.underline}**.4 High oil prices eventually stimulates more
investment in oil exploration and drilling, encouraging technological
innovation under the pressures of a renewed belief that high prices mean
oil is permanently running out. But gravity eventually takes its course.
**[Exceptionally high prices]{.underline}** that follow the boom cycle
then **[hinder]{.underline}** continued **[economic
acceleration]{.underline}**. Commodity and asset **[market bubbles burst
and recession ensues,]{.underline}** limiting new demand for oil and
thereby **[bringing oil prices to a collapse]{.underline}**. This lasts
until cheap energy and government financial market interventions yet
again restore economic equilibrium and growth. Producers, concerned
about losses in their market shares, initiate price wars, which leave
markets even more oversupplied, until low prices stimulate economic
growth and oil demand once more. **[The oil cycle has brought with it a
similarly volatile economic cycle for the petrostates of the Middle
East, whose governments have rapidly fluctuated between gigantic cash
surpluses of so-called "petrodollars" and socially devastating budget
deficits.]{.underline}** Dubbed the resource curse, the massive influx
of oil revenues during the commodities price up cycle discourages
productive, non-commodities-linked investment, which is needed for long
term-growth. **[The influx of petrodollars also fosters
corruption]{.underline}** and patronage, **[drives]{.underline}** real
estate and stock market **[bubbles]{.underline}**, as well as provides
irresistible incentives for wasteful government spending on white
elephant projects **[and military expansion]{.underline}**. **[The
geopolitical component of this oil megacycle can be particularly
insidious]{.underline}**. As oil capitals like Moscow, Riyadh, Abu
Dhabi, Doha and Tehran reap massive profits with a sudden influx of
petrodollars not easily recycled into domestic economies, significant
**[financial reserves become available for]{.underline}** arms purchases
and **[military adventurism]{.underline}**. Such initiatives are
designed to protect the ruling class from both external threats (real
and imagined) and internal challenges through robust internal security
spending. Today, military employment in the Middle East is particularly
high at three percent while military expenditures as a percentage of
gross domestic product (GDP) is also strikingly high.5 For instance, it
is above ten percent in Saudi Arabia.6 **[The regional arms race that
accompanies high oil prices boosts not only arsenals of key countries in
the Middle East but also their subnational proxies and even terrorist
organizations]{.underline}** that arise to challenge the status quo.
Ironically, the flow of weapons driven by the oil price boom then
increases the geopolitical risk to oil production, once again laying the
groundwork for a future rise in oil prices as fears grow that military
conflict will once again disrupt supplies. In this way, as noted by
historian Toby Craig Jones: "oil and war have become increasingly
interconnected in the Middle East," with the United States not only
"mired in the middle" but "its approach to oil has abetted the
outcome."7 In fact, the United States and the West unwittingly
participate in propelling the geopolitical nature of the oil cycle by
recycling petrodollars via the sales of military equipment. In the
mid-2000s, to reduce the pressure of the trade deficit on the U.S.
dollar, the United States offered the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries a \$20 billion arms deal that now equips today's conflicts.8
**[Recently, the level of geopolitical conflict underlying the Middle
East's oil mega cycle is particularly dangerous]{.underline}**, coupled
with the Arab Spring uprisings and the dashed expectations of a new
generation of youth. Not only have borders and identity politics in the
region blurred in a manner that will be hard to reconstitute, but **[key
institutions and infrastructure are being rapidly
destroyed.]{.underline}** For oil resource development, a business that
requires huge capital inflows, long lead times and complex engineering,
the **[rising instability and collapse of institutions in]{.underline}**
certain **[Middle East countries bodes ill for future regional economic
progress]{.underline}**. [Regardless of the promise of new oil and gas
supplies from shale formations in North America and beyond, a third of
global oil production is still sourced from the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) region]{.underline}. While this might be able to be
reduced over time, for the next few years, the fate of Middle East oil
will still have huge impacts on the global economy. REGIONAL BATTLES AND
OIL FACILITIES The oil price spikes of the 2000s are presenting complex
energy and conflict challenges, problems that harken back to previous
periods. Just as violence in the region devastated key oil facilities in
the 1980s and early 1990s, today's battles continue to destabilize
important energy producing centers. Current regional armed conflicts
over oil fields raise a serious new risk that oil facilities are
becoming strategic assets and spoils of war. The level of damage will be
tied to the effectiveness of the United States and its allies to contain
the spread of ISIS to new locations and the possibility of peaceful
resolution of regional proxy wars. Russia's buildup of troops in Syria
adds another complication to the limited options facing the United
States as it tries to build coalitions for a political transition in
Syria. Despite the current energy surplus, Washington needs to avoid
complacency about the global energy balance or it will find itself with
few options in the continued destruction of energy infrastructure in the
Middle East. Unlike past regional wars, which were characterized by
state-to-state armed conflict, today's friction points largely involve
sub-national groups such as ISIS, Al Qaeda and other local militias.
These sub-national groups are the ones this time around focused on
gaining control of oil production and refining installations in
contested areas. Their political impermanence has created unique
problems, not the least of which is the inclination to use force to deny
access to the facilities by regional rivals or the devolved state
government. In the last year, 1.9 million b/d of oil productive capacity
has been lost in the Middle East due largely to conflict.9 And, there is
a lot more at stake, given that the MENA region produces 32.5 million
b/d, about a third of total world production.10 Saudi Arabia's eastern
province, which has been targeted by ISIS, is the home to over 90
percent of the kingdom's oil production and the vast majority of world's
spare oil production capacity.11 **[The current pace of arms buying in
the region gives little reason for optimism.]{.underline}** Even as
Saudi Arabia's oil revenues were declining precipitously towards the end
of 2014, Saudi Arabia was increasing its military spending to more than
ten percent of its GDP.12 The United Arab Emirates military spending was
similarly high at three to four percent of its GDP, with Qatar at two to
three percent.13 U.S. policy fed into this risky trend with President
Obama promising new sales in arms to the GCC, in the aftermath of the
historic P5+1 nuclear deal with Iran, including a \$5 billion deal with
Saudi Arabia for 600 Patriot missiles.14 The United States is engaged in
a diplomatic effort to reduce hostilities among key players and unify
the effort to stop ISIS. Russia for its part seems to have rejected a
diplomatic solution for the time being, committing more troops and
material to the Assad regime in Syria.15 Our historical analysis of the
impact of regional wars on long term oil market trends would suggest
that the continuation of current conflicts could have major consequences
for the upcoming global oil supply. In a study with coauthor Mahmoud
El-Gamal, who utilizes Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) analysis to
measure the effects of price and investment return variables on oil
production at various frequencies, we found that wars in which oil
production and export infrastructure were damaged, resulted in a
significant discontinuity in oil market trends.16 In other words, data
suggests that military conflicts over oil result in significant
disruptions in oil capacity in the medium term and beyond, driving
prices higher for some period of time until markets can adjust. Analysis
conducted by Peter Toft explores the link between intrastate conflict
and oil supply disruptions using a different methodology. By recording
oil production changes during the course of the 39 civil wars in oil
producing countries between 1965 and 2007, Toft concludes that
intrastate conflict intermittently leads to oil supply disruptions
around fifty percent of the time. 17 While Toft's assessment serves as a
valuable indicator of the short-term impacts of civil war, it fails to
take into account the long-term political and social changes that drive
down oil production. There is an indication that a protracted process of
consolidating power that follows the transformation of internal politics
can be far more harmful to oil sector investment -- and thus production
capacity -- than simply the infrastructural damage incurred during the
initial course of the conflict. Our analysis shows that war damaged
facilities often remain offline for prolonged periods following
conflict, if not for an indefinite timeframe.18 Militias throughout the
Middle East have learned they can undermine the authority of existing
political leadership in the region by overtaking oil facilities.19 A
prime example of this strategy has been amply demonstrated in Libya
where what might have been a successful transitioning government fell
into disarray as rebel factions grabbed and turned off key oil
installations, thereby denying access to eastern Libyan ports.20 A more
threatening trend is the focus of ISIS on a similar strategy, one that
is systematically destroying oil and gas production capacity in
contested areas in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya. There is a dual threat
to regional oil facilities from both the rise of ISIS and escalating
proxy wars around the Middle East. Not only is major production and
export infrastructure in Iraq, Syria and Libya at risk, but ISIS is also
threatening neighboring countries should conflict spread to its
principal sponsors. ISIS has already attacked civilian Shia communities
inside Saudi Arabia including targets in Saudi Arabia's eastern province
and in Kuwait. Saudi Arabia has fortified its northern borders with Iraq
with more military hardware and troops, while Iranian forces have moved
into positions near the southern Iraqi oil fields, raising the risks of
border skirmishes.**[21The militarization of border areas so heavily
populated with oil fields and export infrastructure brings with it

[Even if it is being played only by rational adversaries, the advancing
strategic \"game\" would demand that each contestant **relentlessly
strive for \"escalation dominance.\"**]{.underline} [Ominously, it is in
the thoroughly unpracticed internal dynamics of any such rivalry that
[the]{.mark} serious [prospect of]{.mark} a **genuinely
[\"Armageddon\"]{.mark} scenario** [could]{.mark} sometime [be
realized]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This intolerable outcome could be
produced either in unexpected increments of escalation by any or all of

with utterly unforeseen intersections, interactions and \"synergies,\"
we can never predict with any reassuring degree of precision whether

Indeed, should Trump ever proceed to strike Iran on the erroneously
nonspecific assumption that his generals have already \"got everything
covered,\" he ought then to be reminded of the classic military warning
of Carl von Clausewitz: Long before any military planners could even
envision a nuclear war, the great Prussian general had cautioned about
\"friction,\" or \"the difference between war on paper, and war as it
actually is.\"

### Accidental War

#### Oil uncertainty causes accidental war -- its really bad because it definitely involves Iran

**CBS, 2019**

("Iran news: \"Sabotage attacks\" on Saudi oil tankers stoke fears of
\"conflict happening by accident\"," CBS, 13 May 2019,
<https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-news-saudi-arabia-sabotage-oil-tankers-fujairah-uae-fears-us-iran-conflict-2019-05-13/>)

**[Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia said Monday two of its oil **[tankers
were sabotaged off the coast of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[A]{.underline}**rab **[E]{.underline}**mirates **[in attacks that
caused \"significant damage]{.underline}**\" to the vessels. One of the
ships was en route to pick up Saudi oil to take to the United States, a
Saudi government minister said. The announcement by the kingdom\'s
energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, came on the heels of a new warning to
sailors in the region from the U.S. While no blame was cast at
[Iran](https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/nuclear-iran/?intcid=CNI-00-10aaa3a)
or any other nation for the alleged attack on the ships, it fuelled
fears that **[a miscommunication or small act of antagonism in the
politically charged region could quickly escalate into a full
conflict.]{.underline}** Late last week the **[U.S. Maritime
Administration warned]{.underline}** commercial shipping companies that
from the beginning **[of]{.underline}** May there had been, \"an
**[increased possibility that Iran]{.underline}** and/or its regional
proxies **[could take action against U.S. and partner interests,
including oil]{.underline}** production infrastructure, after recently
threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz. Iran or its proxies could
respond by targeting commercial vessels, including oil tankers, or U.S.
military vessels in the Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, or the Persian
Gulf.\" [As U.S. bombers arrive, defiant Iran says U.S. \"will not
dare\"
attack](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-news-donald-trump-b-52-bombers-persian-gulf-revolutionary-guard-us-not-dare-attack/)
The statement from the Saudi government on the alleged \"sabotage
attacks\" off the United Arab Emirates port at Fujairah came just hours
after Iranian and Lebanese media outlets aired false reports of
explosions at the port, which sits less than 100 miles from the mouth of
the vital Strait of Hormuz shipping channel. Emirati officials have
declined to elaborate on the nature of the sabotage or say who might
have been responsible. A U.S. defense official told CBS News national
security correspondent David Martin that the UAE had requested American
assistance investigating the incidents, and the U.S. was sending a team
of investigators to help. A total of four tankers sustained some damage
on Sunday, according to UAE officials. One of the others was Norwegian
owned, but officials in that country did not immediately confirm any
links to the apparent attacks on the Saudi-flagged vessels. Early
Sunday, the U.S. Maritime Administration issued a new warning to sailors
about the alleged sabotage, while stressing \"the incident has not been
confirmed.\" It urged shippers to exercise caution in the area for the
next week. It remains unclear if the previous warning from the U.S.
agency is the same perceived threat, or part of it, that prompted the
White House to order the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike
group and the B-52 bombers to the region on May 4. Iran calls for
details Shortly after the Saudi announcement, Iran\'s Foreign Ministry
called for further clarification about what exactly happened with the
Saudi tankers. The ministry\' spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, was quoted by
the official IRNA news agency as saying there should be more information
about the incident. Mousavi also warned against any \"conspiracy
orchestrated by ill-wishers\" and \"adventurism by foreigners\" to
undermine the maritime region\'s stability and security. **[An Iranian
lawmaker suggested]{.underline}** in the country\'s parliament on Monday
that **[the attacks]{.underline}** on the Saudi ships **[could have been
carried out by unspecified \"saboteurs\" from an also unspecified third
countr]{.underline}**y. Fears of an escalation Even without any actual
accusation that Iran or its \"proxies\" were behind the purported attack
on the Saudi tankers, **[the incident clearly demonstrated how high
tensions are in the region]{.underline}**, and some other countries were
quick to express their concern**[. Britain\'s Foreign Minister Jeremy
Hunt warned of the risks of an \"accident\" sparking a conflict between
the United States and Iran. \"We are very worried about the risk of a
conflict happening by accident with an escalation that is
unintended]{.underline}**,\" Hunt said in Brussels, where U.S. Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo arrived to discuss the Iran standoff with European
counterparts. \"What we need is a period of calm to make sure that
everyone understands what the other side is thinking,\" Hunt said,
adding that would share those concerns Monday with his European partners
and Pompeo. Underlying the regional risk, the general-secretary of the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council described the alleged sabotage as
**[a \"serious escalation]{.underline}**\" in an overnight statement.
\"Such irresponsible acts **[will increase tension and conflicts in the
region and expose its peoples to great danger]{.underline}**,\"
Abdullatif bin Rashid al-Zayani said. Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen\'s
internationally recognized government similarly condemned the alleged
sabotage. **[Tensions have risen]{.underline}** in the year
**[since]{.underline}** President **[Trump]{.underline}** unilaterally
**[withdrew]{.underline}** the United States **[from the]{.underline}**
2015 **[nuclear deal]{.underline}** between Iran and world powers,
**[restoring American sanctions that have pushed Iran]{.underline}**\'s
economy in**[to crisis]{.underline}**. Last week, **[Iran warned it
would begin enriching uranium at higher levels]{.underline}** in 60 days
if world powers failed to negotiate new terms for the deal.

#### Most likely nuclear impact -- tensions are high and we don't have many strategies for de-escalation

**[There have been a number of]{.underline}** other **[attacks recently,
including a missile attack]{.underline}** Wednesday **[that
struck]{.underline}** the arrivals hall of **[an airport
in]{.underline}** southwestern **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**, injuring
26 people. Houthi rebels were said to be behind that attack and others.
Last month, **[a drone attacked a Saudi oil pipeline]{.underline}**,
temporarily putting it out of commission. The Houthis, said to be backed
by Iran, have been fighting Saudi Arabia in Yemen, after driving out the
Yemeni government in 2015. "**[We're going to get more of these ... as
long as we have crippling sanctions in place that they believe are
intended to cause economic collapse and regime change. They're not going
to back down]{.underline}**. I think **[it's going to be a hot
summer]{.underline}**," said Croft.Croft said it will be important to
see if European leaders are able to work with Tehran to find a way to
lessen the impact of U.S. sanctions and keep it from abandoning the
nuclear deal it struck with the U.S. and five other countries. The
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration d**[ropped out of the agreement,
calling it one-sided, and reinstated sanctions on Iran last year. Iran
has threatened to walk away if there's no resolution by July 7. It could
then]{.underline}** return to **[enrich]{.underline}**ing
**[uranium,]{.underline}** at levels closer **[to weapons
grade]{.underline}**. "**[The question is will it be a nuclear
summer]{.underline}**?" said Croft. The incident occurred as Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Tehran, conducting talks in an effort
to cool tensions between Iran and the U.S. "Abe is in Tehran trying to
get an off-ramp, and a Japanese tanker is struck. To me, at the minimum
it shows the challenges of trying to reach a diplomatic solution, as
long as the United States is pushing coercive diplomacy," said Croft.
Morse said the supply outside of the U.S. is tight. He said **[the world
market is particularly low on]{.underline}** the heavy grade of
**[crude]{.underline}** produced by both Iran and Venezuela, both
**[under U.S. sanctions]{.underline}**. More than 1 million barrels of
Iranian oil has been removed from the market by U.S. sanctions. "There
are two discrepancies. One is the discrepancy between the physical side
and demand, and there's a discrepancy between the U.S. side and the rest
of the world," he said. The U.S. has added 53 million barrels more to
commercial storage than at this time last year. "Meanwhile, on the
sidelines OPEC plus has decided not to put more oil on the market,"
Morse said. OPEC, plus Russia, is expected to retain its agreement to
hold back production.

seven days: last Monday four oil tankers -- two of them Saudi flagged --
were reportedly attacked near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. United
States and Saudi security officials
[suspect](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-oil-tankers-attacked-before-entering-persian-gulf-11557725971)
that Iran or Iranian proxies are behind Sunday's attack, though no
specific details have been made public or can be confirmed. Iran has
denied responsibility for the incident and accused the United States and
Saudi Arabia of engineering events as a "[false flag
attack](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/iran-denies-accusation-attacks-oil-tankers-uae-coast-190514181857002.html)"
meant to goad Iran into war. To add fuel to the fire, Saudi officials
say a drone
[damaged](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/saudi-oil-attack.html)
one of its oil pipelines on Tuesday causing it to briefly shut down. The
pipeline, which spans from east to west across Saudi Arabia to the Red
Sea is critical in bringing supply to export facilities that are a
redundancy to get oil to the global market if shipping is blocked in the
Persian Gulf. Houthi rebels in Yemen, aligned with Iran, have claimed
responsibility for the attack against critical Saudi infrastructure.
Thus, if true, both supply routes have been threatened -- putting global
oil supply at risk. Furthermore, **[Tehran has

### Saudi Nukes

#### Close ties with China result in Saudi nuclearization

**Bar'el, 2019**

(Ziv, "China Reaches Its Arm Deep Into the Middle East, Giving Israel
Cause for Concern," 15 June 2019,
<https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-china-s-invisible-hand-in-the-middle-east-is-a-political-masterstroke-1.7369281>)

But it seems that when the Saudi kingdom is busy making a profit and
looking for ways to harm Iran, the Uighur minority isn't its most
important issue. One would think the Saudi-Chinese relationship should
please Washington and Israel; according to the simplistic view, any harm
to Iran benefits the West. Thus if the Chinese market is stolen from
Iran, that serves the American sanctions well. The problem is that
**[relations between China and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** also **[have
military implications that should]{.underline}** bother -- if not very
much **[worry -- the United States]{.underline}** and Israel. **[If
Riyadh is really buying missile technology and if China is one of the
countries that builds nuclear power plants in Saudi Arabia, this will
give China two firm foundations in developing Saudi
technology]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, the **[kingdom will skirt the
restrictions that are usually part of technology
projects]{.underline}**, and military and **[nuclear ones all the more
so,]{.underline}** that are built by American companies all over the
globe. The paradox is that **[the United States is]{.underline}**
putting heavy pressure on Israel to stop cooperating in military
technology with China but is **[totally silent when Saudi Arabia brings
home Chinese technology,]{.underline}** including that **[for building
ballistic missiles.]{.underline}** The lack of a public Israeli response
to these revelations is interesting, too. If a few decades ago Israel
applied all its diplomatic efforts to block the sale of AWACS planes --
Airborne Early Warning and Control Systems -- to Saudi Arabia, today it
seems Israel is apathetic about Saudi Arabia buying arms, as if the
kingdom were a strategic ally. Crown Prince **[Mohammed announced a few
months ago that if Iran obtains nuclear weapons, [Saudi Arabia will,
too](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/saudi-crown-prince-says-will-develop-nuclear-bomb-if-iran-does-1.5909847)]{.underline}**.
True, Riyadh doesn't have skilled people in the nuclear industry, in
nuclear weapons especially, but **[the Saudis' friends in
China]{.underline}**, Pakistan and India **[won't hesitate to supply
it]{.underline}** with all its needs in this area. (And the kingdom
plans to invest billions of dollars in the next few years in the latter
two countries.) **[When Prince Mohammed observes the harsh disagreements
between Congress and the U.S. administration over the sale of
conventional weapons to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**, and with his friend
Trump possibly out of office a year and a half from now, **[it's only
natural that Riyadh would hurry and build]{.underline}** an economic and
**[military security net with]{.underline}** the help of
**[China]{.underline}** and Russia. The question that will come up in
the near future is **[who will watch over the development of the
Saudis']{.underline}** ballistic missiles and **[nuclear
program.]{.underline}**

**Nuclear war**

**Ismail '15** (Muhammad Ismail, Ph.D. in Political Science @ Qurtuba
University, assistant professor @ Qurtuba University, teaches
master-level Political Science courses. "Iran's Nuclear Program:
Regional Implications and Possible Outcomes," 2015 in *Asian Politics &
Policy*, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aspp.12184/epdf)

While some observers talk about the inevitability of nuclear
proliferation in West Asia should Iran develops its own nuclear weapons,
others do not agree. Bahgat (2007b, pp. 66, 86, 118, 123--124, 213)
believes that a nuclear weapons option is highly unlikely for Saudi
Arabia, based on an understanding of its relationship with the United
States. This article contends, however, that [[it is **highly possible**
that]{.mark} [Saudi Arabia]{.mark} [may opt for nuclear weapons]{.mark}
technology of its own]{.underline}. According to leaked U.S. diplomatic
cables, King Abdullah had, on several occasions, advised the U.S.
government to carry out preemptive attacks on Iranian nuclear
facilities. These cables also describe how other Arab countries in West
Asia have secretly argued for forceful military action against Iran's
nuclear program. [Saudi Arabia's energy consumption has been rising, so
it recognizes the necessity of developing nuclear power to increase
reservoirs of energy. If the Saudi government develops nuclear plants to
generate electricity, then it could possibly go in the direction of
**producing nuclear weapons** should Iran declare itself a
NWS]{.underline}. [Although Saudi Arabia has signed the]{.underline}
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ([NPT]{.underline}),
Iran's nuclear program might make a Saudi nuclear program inevitable
(Black, 2013; Lake & Rogin, 2014). [[Saudi Arabia and Iran have been
**arch-enemies**]{.mark} since the 1979 Islamic Revolution]{.underline}.
[One reason is that they have longstanding religious
tensions]{.underline}. One represents the Sunni Wahabi sect of Islam and
the other Shiite sect of Islam. [This division brought religious
animosity into regional politics as well, because both nations harbor
hopes of exercising Islamic leadership]{.underline}. Moreover,
[[the]{.mark} Saudi and Iranian [governments are locked in a **violent**
and **frightening competition**]{.mark} over Lebanon's internal
politics]{.underline}. The Iranian government supports Hezbollah while
Saudi Arabia openly supports the Sunnis and Christians in Lebanon.
Following after the 2006 Lebanon-Israel War, the Saudi and Iranian
governments used their respective influence over the different Lebanese
political factions to find a political settlement (Wehrey et al., 2009).
Furthermore, [the two nations possess different views about the regional
security order]{.underline}, [with the [Saudis fearful that]{.mark} a
nuclear [Iran will become]{.mark} more [powerful and will
threaten]{.mark} [its]{.mark} immediate West Asian [neighbors by
**igniting Shiite beliefs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, thus, [perceives Iran's nuclear threat more acutely
than the rest of the West Asian states]{.underline}. Iran's nuclear
program could create tensions between these two major powers with
strategic and security repercussions beyond the immediate neighborhood
(Black, 2013; Lake & Rogin, 2014). Historical Background of Saudi
Arabia-Iran Rivalry Relations were not always difficult, however. Before
1979, diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia were normal and
cordial because the United States was a friend to both countries and did
not let them compete with one another (Delpech, 2006, p. 79). The basic
and most important objective of both countries then was to prevent the
spread of the Soviet Union's communist influence in West Asia (Delpech,
2006, p. 79). After 1979, relations soured because of the brand of Islam
and type of government introduced by Khomeini. The Iran-Iraq War
(1980--1988) further deteriorated the bilateral ties between them,
because the Saudi government openly helped Iraq against Iran. The
rivalry between the two countries for regional leadership became intense
in the 1980s and Iran has never forgiven Saudi Arabia for supporting
Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq War (Delpech, 2006, p. 79). The
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 again lessened the tension between
Iranian and Saudi governments but in the 1990s, Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani did not do enough to revive the cordial relations
between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Under the reformist Muhammad Khatami,
during the last years of 1990s and early 2000s, top-level bilateral
relations improved (Delpech, 2006, p. 79), leading the two nations to
sign an agreement on regional security in April 2001. Then, in February
2002, [Prince Abdullah openly repudiated reference to Iran as part of
the "Axis of Evil"]{.underline} (Delpech, 2006, p. 79). The Persian Gulf
States are nearer to Iran than other states and they have been thought
of as being more concerned about Iran's nuclear quest. [Soon after
establishing a new theocratic model of government in 1979]{.underline},
[the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini spoke openly against the
Arab governments, questioned the legitimacy of the ruling monarchical
families of the neighboring Persian Gulf States, and has continuously
called for replacing these monarchical regimes with Islamic type of
governments the way they had established in Iran. This attitude of the
Iranian ruling class toward helping non state actors to oust the Saudi
monarchy led to the deterioration of erstwhile cordial relations between
the Saudi and Iranian governments]{.underline}. McNaugher (1984) argues
that the Persian Gulf countries are not militarily strong enough to
defend their territorial integrity and sovereignty from external attack.
He further points out that these countries often look abroad for ways of
deterring threats and settling serious disputes among regional players
(p. 517). The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have mainly been
promoting regionalism rather than conflict resolution among their
members. [[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus, ostensibly [[has
only the following]{.mark} [options]{.mark} in response to Iran's
nuclear quest: (1) ignore Iran's nuclear quest; (2) increase its close
association with the United States or formally accept U.S. protection
against any external threat or attack; or (3) [develop its own nuclear
program to counter the Iranian threat]{.mark}]{.underline} (Nuri, 2006,
p. 22). [Due to the nature of distrust between Iran and Saudi Arabia,
the **first option is not viable**]{.underline}. [The second option is
also not viable after the Iran-U.S. rapprochement following the November
deal and because Saudi Arabia wants to decrease its dependency on United
States]{.underline}. [[The third option is the **most viable**]{.mark}
[but it is also the **most dangerous**]{.mark} one]{.underline}. In
fact, [the worst-case implication of Iran's nuclear program on the whole
West Asian region would be that some important states like Saudi Arabia
would opt to develop their own nuclear weapons program]{.underline}.
[Saudi Arabia is one of the most important, strongest, wealthiest, and
biggest states in West Asia and it has the capability to initiate its
own nuclear weapons program]{.underline}, to balance Iranian nuclear
power with the same nuclear-ready status. [[This would]{.mark} [risk
creating an **uncontrollable nuclear arms race**]{.mark} in West
Asia]{.underline}, [making it the most dangerous region in the world
because **[even a minor incident can create havoc]{.mark} in the
region**]{.underline}. No one can tell when the Saudi government might
change its mind and start to develop its own nuclear weapons (Bahgat,
2006, pp. 421--443; Russell, 2008, pp. 521--537), because Saudi Arabia
has a long-standing tradition of hostility toward Iran that goes deeper
than the issue of nuclear weapons (Delpech, 2006, p. 79). Contending
Positions Saudi Arabia's ruling class is worried about possible
preemptive strikes on Iran's nuclear installations by the United States
or Israel or by both of them, because in retaliation, the Iranian forces
plus its mercenaries in the region might target U.S. strategic
installations and military bases in the region, especially in the
Persian Gulf States, including the U.S. Air Force base and headquarters
in Qatar (Hersch, 2006, p. 42). In August 2002, the Iranian opposition
group, Mujahedeen-e Khalq revealed that Iran's hidden nuclear activities
were causing discomfort among all its neighboring countries, including
Saudi Arabia. [Saudi Arabia views Iran's nuclear program as a
significant effort toward the domination of the West Asian
region]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}, thus, [took a clear and public
stand against Iran's nuclear quest]{.underline}. After all, Saudi Arabia
does not possess a nuclear weapons program and it has commitments as a
non-NWS under the nuclear NPT signed in 1988. The Saudi government also
signed the safeguards agreement in 2005 declaring that "the kingdom did
not (possess) facilities, nuclear reactors or fissile materials," stated
that the kingdom was "anxious to cooperate continually with the IAEA,"
and pledged to abide by the NPT (Delpech, 2006, pp. 79--80). Saudi
Arabia also supported the diplomatic talks between Iran and the
Europeans, as failure by the international community to stop Iran's
nuclear quest will certainly have direct repercussions for Saudi Arabia.
However, [Iran's mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle may give impetus to
the Saudi government to opt for nuclear technology. [If Saudi Arabia
opts for its own nuclear program]{.mark}, [its government might seek
help from **Pakistani nuclear research scientists**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Sokolski, 2006, p. 33), [as there is a longstanding close relationship
between the Saudi and Pakistani governments regarding nuclear
technology]{.underline}. It is believed that Saudi Arabia provided
significant funds to Pakistan's nuclear program from the outset, and it
is quite well known that relations between the Saudi and Pakistani
intelligence services have been close for a long time, with Saudi
officials having visited Pakistani military nuclear sites several times
(Delpech, 2006, pp. 79--80). There were rumors in December 2004 that
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan had signed an agreement by which Islamabad
promised to help the kingdom develop nuclear technology and acquire
missiles that could give it superiority in the regional balance of power
(Delpech, 2006, pp. 79--80). Iranian professor Abu Mohammed Asgharkani
has stated that Iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon were stepped
up when the Iranian government learned of such an agreement between
Saudi Arabia and Pakistan (Delpech, 2006, pp. 79--80). However, no
confirmation has ever been given so far concerning such reports and the
Saudi government denied it had such plans. The Saudi government said,
"All radioactive products in Saudi Arabia are exclusively for the
purpose of medical and petroleum research" (Delpech, 2006, p. 81).
Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi National Security Advisor, had
wanted his government to join the coalition to stop Iran's enrichment
program (Cooper & Rutenberg, 2007). But there were competing voices. In
2002, Prince Naef bin Ahmed Al-Saud, a colonel in the Saudi Arabian
Armed Forces decried that Israel had a total monopoly on nuclear weapons
in the West Asian region, noted that both the Pakistani and Indian
governments refused to obey the nuclear nonproliferation regimes, and
that both Iran and Iraq were trying to develop nuclear programs
(Al-Saud, 2011, pp. 124--130). Turki al-Faisal, who was then in-charge
of Saudi intelligence and became Saudi Arabia's ambassador to
Washington, said that the Arab states would start developing nuclear
programs if the attempt to stop Iran's nuclear quest does not succeed
(see Dagoni, 2012). He also conveyed in unofficial conversations with
important British and U.S. officials that his government was ready to
deal with the Iranian nuclear issue and will use all economic,
diplomatic, and security resources to deal with the Iranian government's
ambitions to achieve regional power status on achieving the status of a
NWS (Dagoni, 2012). Mitchell Reiss argued that the Saudi government
might follow Iran's nuclear quest in anticipation of the failure of
nuclear nonproliferation efforts in the region to stop Iran's nuclear
program (Reiss, 2004, pp. 3--4). Saudi nuclear abilities are not easy to
understand, and there are few indirect statements that tell us that the
Saudis tried to start and develop a nuclear program. The first secretary
of the Saudi Arabian mission to the United Nations (UN) claimed in the
early 1970s that the Saudi government had developed a nuclear program
for military purposes (Guzansky, 2012, p. 34). The prestigious
newspaper, the Guardian also exposed some official papers that showed
Saudis desperately seeking help and support from the US government on
nuclear technology and extended deterrence, as it was believed that a
party less directly involved in the regional politics can be trusted
(Huth, 1999, pp. 25--48; Morgan, 2003, p. 35).

## AT: High Prices Good

#### Circumstances of the price hike matter -- if its about constrained supply, its dangerous

**Curran and Jamrisko, 2018**

(Enda and Michelle, "What Oil at \$100 a Barrel Would Mean for the
Global Economy," Bloomberg, 30 Sept. 2018,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-30/what-oil-at-100-a-barrel-would-mean-for-the-world-economy>)

Rising [oil
prices](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-24/major-traders-see-return-of-100-oil-due-to-u-s-iran-sanctions)
are prompting forecasts of a return to \$100 a barrel for the first time
since 2014, creating both winners and losers in the world economy.
Exporters of the fuel would enjoy bumper returns, giving a fillip to
companies and government coffers. By contrast, **[consuming nations
would bear the cost]{.underline}** at the pump, potentially **[fanning
inflation and hurting demand]{.underline}**. The good news is that
Bloomberg Economics
[found](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P8QULI6JIJUR) that oil
at \$100 would mean less for global growth in 2018 than it did after the
2011 spike. That's partly because economies are less reliant on energy
and because the shale revolution cushioning the U.S. Ultimately, **[much
depends on why prices are pushing higher]{.underline}**. **[A shock amid
constrained supply is a negative,]{.underline}** but one due to robust
demand just reflects solid growth. Both forces are now in play, driving
Brent crude up about 22 percent this year. 1. What does it mean for
global growth? **[Higher oil prices would hurt]{.underline}** household
**[incomes and]{.underline}** consumer **[spending]{.underline}**, but
the impact would vary. **[Europe is vulnerable given that many of the
region's countries are oil importers. China is the world's biggest
importer of oil and could expect an uptick in inflation]{.underline}**.
There are also seasonal effects to consider, with winter looming in the
Northern hemisphere. Consumers can switch energy sources to keep costs
down, such as biofuels or natural gas, although not quickly. Indonesia
already has [instituted
measures](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/indonesia-set-to-impose-import-curbs-to-halt-currency-s-slide)
to push more use of biofuels and limit the economy's reliance on
imported fuel. **[For a sustained hit to global growth, economists say
oil would need to hold above \$100]{.underline}**. The dollar's gain of
this year doesn't help though given crude is priced in greenbacks. 2.
How can the world economy absorb oil at \$100? Bloomberg Economics found
that **[\$100 oil will do]{.underline}** more **[harm]{.underline}**
than good to global growth. Yet there are important differences in the
condition of the world economy today compared with 2011. "The shale
revolution, lower energy intensity, and higher general price levels mean
the impact will be smaller than it once was," economists led by Jamie
Murray wrote in a recent report. "The price of a barrel will have to go
much higher before global growth slips on an oil slick." 3. How will
Iran and Trump impact the market? **[Geopolitics remains a wild
card]{.underline}**. Renewed U.S. **[sanctions on Iran are already
crimping the Middle East nation's oil exports]{.underline}**. While
President Donald Trump is pressuring the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to pump more, **[there is limited spare production
capacity.]{.underline}** In addition, **[supply from nations including
Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria is being buffeted by economic collapse or
civil unrest]{.underline}**. Still, Goldman Sachs analysts
[predict](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-25/goldman-sachs-pours-cold-water-on-talk-of-100-a-barrel-oil)
\$100 will not be passed. 4. Who wins from higher oil prices? Most of
the biggest oil-producing nations are emerging economies. **[Saudi
Arabia leads the way]{.underline}** with a net oil production that's
almost 21 percent of gross domestic product as of 2016 \-- more than
twice that of Russia, which is the next among 15 major emerging markets
[ranked](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P8EDVJ6K50XY) by
Bloomberg Economics. Other winners could include Nigeria and Colombia.
The increase in revenues will help to repair budgets and current account
deficits, allowing governments to increase spending that will spur
investment. 4. Who loses? **[India, China, Taiwan, Chile, Turkey, Egypt
and Ukraine are among the nations who would take a hit]{.underline}**.
Paying more for oil will pressure current accounts and make economies
more vulnerable to rising U.S. interest rates. Bloomberg Economics has
ranked major emerging markets based on
[vulnerability](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P8EDVJ6K50XY) to
shifts in oil prices, U.S. rates and protectionism. One of the biggest
winners might also find itself on the losing end: Oystein Olsen,
Norway's central bank governor,
[warned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-25/norway-s-central-bank-governor-now-fears-a-return-to-100-oil)
that western Europe's biggest petroleum producer risks problems if the
industry takes its eyes off controlling costs. 5. What does it mean for
the the world's biggest economy? A run-up in oil prices poses a lot less
of a risk to the U.S. than it used to, thanks to the boom in shale oil
production. The old rule of thumb among economists was that a sustained
\$10 per barrel increase would shave about 0.3 percent off of U.S.
output the following year. But tallies now, including that of Moody's
Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, pencil in a hit of around 0.1
percent. While the diminishing American reliance on imported oil has
positive economic consequences at the industry level, poorer households
would feel the weight of higher prices at the pump. They spend about 8
percent of their pre-tax income on gasoline, compared to about one
percent for the top fifth of earners. 6. Will it lead to higher
inflation around the world? Energy prices often carry a heavy weight in
consumer price gauges, prompting policy makers including those at the
Federal Reserve to focus simultaneously on core indexes that remove
volatile energy costs. But a substantial run-up in oil prices could
provide a more durable uptick for overall inflation if the costs filter
through to transportation and utilities. 7. What does it mean for
central banks? If stronger oil prices boost inflation, central bankers
on balance will have one less reason to keep monetary policy loose.
Among the most-exposed economies, central bankers in India already are
warning about the impact as the nation's biggest import item gets more
expensive. Greater overall price pressures also could prompt faster
monetary policy tightening in economies such as Thailand, Indonesia, the
[Philippines](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PFFXGN6S9728) and
[South
Africa](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-20/south-africa-holds-key-rate-as-recession-trumps-market-turmoil).

#### Lots of factors mean high prices now are bad

**Strauss, 2019**

(Delphine, "Global economy shrugs off latest rise in oil prices,"
Financial Times, 29 April 2019,
<https://www.ft.com/content/8a41c2ca-6844-11e9-a79d-04f350474d62>)

As recently as five years ago, taking a large producer such as Venezuela
out of the market would have pushed prices above \$100, but now the
impact was limited, Prof Butler said. If oil prices settled around \$70
a barrel, they would in real terms be 50 per cent below their level five
years ago and barely changed from 40 years ago, he added. But some
analysts say that **[an oil shock, even if less damaging than in the
past, could pose a threat to the fragile global
expansion.]{.underline}** Jason **[Bordoff, a professor at Columbia
University]{.underline}** who advised the Obama administration on
energy, **[said prices could be higher and more volatile in the longer
term]{.underline}**. **[US shale production would not grow fast enough
to absorb new demand]{.underline}** indefinitely, he said. Nor could
shale companies be relied on to crank up production whenever prices
rose. Although their ability to do this has helped cap prices in recent
years, as established oil groups took over from smaller producers they
might be less inclined to carry the costs of scaling up and down.
Analysts at Oxford Economics, the consultancy, argue there is a risk of
a more immediate, if shortlived, price rise, saying **[it would take
only "one more shock to supply]{.underline}**", such as unrest in
Nigeria's Delta region, **[to push prices above \$100 a
barrel]{.underline}** this year. They estimate **[this would leave
global growth 0.6 per cent lower by the end of 2020 and drive the
sharpest increase in global inflation since 2011]{.underline}**.
Although most analysts think \$100 oil is very unlikely at present,
Oxford Economics' analysis illustrates the effects any price rise could
have on the global economy. Both **[the]{.underline}** overall
**[impact]{.underline}**, and the pattern of winners and losers, **[has
changed significantly in the past decade]{.underline}**. Oil producers,
whose public finances were strained following the 2014 drop in prices,
might now be more likely to spend extra budget revenues, cushioning the
impact of price swings on global demand. The eurozone is likely to be
less vulnerable. Consumption and production have become less oil
intensive, with growth increasingly driven by services, and labour
markets are in better shape. The European Central Bank said last
September that a stable price of \$75 a barrel would have little effect
on real incomes or consumption. The biggest losers would be
**[oil-importing emerging economies]{.underline}**. With oil at \$100,
both Turkey and Argentina **[would lose close to 1 per cent of
GDP]{.underline}**, according to Oxford Economics. The hit to growth in
**[China and India would be similar]{.underline}**, it said. **[An
oil-induced slowdown]{.underline}** in these countries **[would be far
more damaging now than in the past]{.underline}**, since they are more
integrated into the global economy than previously. But the most
significant change in the past decade has been in the link between oil
prices and US growth. US interests used to be clear cut: a rise in
gasoline prices rapidly hit GDP through its effect on consumers. The
2014 oil slump could have been expected to add about 1 percentage point
to output growth. But research published by the Brookings Institution
showed the net stimulus was close to zero, because gains for consumers
were offset by a dramatic decline in investment by the oil sector.
Gasoline prices remain a big issue in an election year, but with the US
set to become a net exporter, politicians must now weigh the interests
of consumers against those of oil producers and their workers. "**[The
political costs are high]{.underline}**er than the economic costs," said
Andreas Economou, at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, noting
that while the interests of oil consuming and oil producing \[US\]
states were diverging, "consumers dominate in the swing states that any
candidate would want to secure".

#### Price spikes crush competition and demand and have increasingly complicated geopolitical effects

Price, 27 Sept. 2018,
<https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Total-Oil-Could-Rise-100-And-Thats-Bad-News.html>)

Supply disruptions and the lag time associated with OPEC's ability to
increase production could send oil prices to **[\$100 a
barrel]{.underline}**, but this **[isn't good news for the
economy]{.underline}** and the oil industry, Total's chief executive
Patrick Pouyanne told
[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-09-27/total-sees-100-oil-coming-and-says-it-may-not-be-a-good-thing)
in an interview. Disruptions in supply coming from Iran, Venezuela, and
Libya give strong support to oil prices and they may head into
triple-digit territory, according to Pouyanne, who reminded Bloomberg
television that he predicted this development as early as in June this
year. On the other hand, although OPEC has pledged to boost production,
output hasn't increased so much, Pouyanne told Bloomberg. **[Saudi
Arabia has capacity of 11 million bpd, but boosting production from
current levels would need time]{.underline}**, because they have to
mobilize rigs. "**[You don't push a button and then oil flows. It's more
complex than that]{.underline}**," Pouyanne said. **[Total's chief
executive believes that \$100 oil is a real possibility, but he is not
especially thrilled with it. "I'm not sure it's good news, by the way,
for the world economy, even for the oil industry,]{.underline}** because
you know, **[when price goes too high then you open the door to your
competitors and competition and demand will fall]{.underline}** again,"
the manager said. [Related: \$80 Oil: Increased Investment Or Demand
Destruction?](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/80-Oil-Increased-Investment-Or-Demand-Destruction.html)
Pouyanne is joining a growing number of industry executives and analysts
who have started to predict that \$100 is now a real possibility, with
Iranian sanctions expected to remove more than 1 million bpd from the
oil market, on top of the likelihood that Venezuela's production will
drop further and Libya's supply will face further interruptions thanks
to security troubles. In a tightening oil market, this past weekend an
OPEC/non-OPEC panel congratulated itself on the job well done so far,
and [said](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/5160.htm) it was
satisfied with the "overall healthy balance between supply and demand,"
snubbing calls by U.S. President Donald Trump to lower oil prices. The
wait-and-see approach by OPEC and Russia sent oil prices surging to
their highest in four years, and major oil traders started to call
[**[\$100

## AT: Vision 2030

#### Vision 2030 is a sham -- its lip service and impossible to implement, funding is not the problem

**Nuruzzaman, 2018**

(Mohamad - Associate Professor of International Relations at the Gulf
University for Science and Technology in Kuwait, "[Saudi Arabia's
'Vision 2030': Will It Save Or Sink the Middle
East?](https://www.e-ir.info/2018/07/10/saudi-arabias-vision-2030-will-it-save-or-sink-the-middle-east/),"

<https://www.e-ir.info/2018/07/10/saudi-arabias-vision-2030-will-it-save-or-sink-the-middle-east/>)

Bin Salman's 'Vision 2030' is much akin to, and also different from, the
Shah's and King Faisal's authoritarian top-down modernization models, as
it is primarily fueled by oil money. He is executing a massive
transformation program in a tight, suffocating political environment, as
was the case with Shah's Iran or King Faisal's Saudi Arabia. What is
more, 'Vision 2030' looks more [a continuation of a series of 5-year
development
plans](https://www.meforum.org/articles/2016/saudi-arabia-s-flawed-vision-2030-(1))
from 1975 to 2015, particularly the ninth development plan (2010 --
2015) which the Kingdom adopted to build infrastructure, to develop
human resources, to raise the skills level of Saudi workers, and to
promote sustainable development. What differentiate it from the previous
modernization models are its scale and intensity -- its goal to
transform Saudi Arabia in the context of a globalized world, its thrust
on private sector-led development and its attempts to strike a balance
between private sector forces, foreign investors and application of
technologies to accelerate the pace of modernization. **[More than years
into 'Vision 2030', hardly is there any significant achievement Bin
Salman has made to report, other than a few cosmetic social
reforms]{.underline}** like granting women the rights to drive and to
attend events in sports stadiums. **[Contrary to expectations, there has
been a [downturn in major economic
indicators](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html):
rate of economic growth declined]{.underline}** from 1.7% in 2016 to
0.1% in 2017; industrial growth rate went into negative territory
(-0.3%) in 2017 while **[unemployment]{.underline}** rate of Saudi
nationals **[stood at 12.8% last year]{.underline}**. The initial
picture of '**[Vision 2030' is rather disappointing]{.underline}**
despite some competitive edges the Kingdom has at its disposal.
Available huge resources, respectable global economic standing and a
large pool of cheap, if not slave, foreign labor were expected to
facilitate an easy move towards realizing the goals of this mega
project. Currently, [the
Kingdom](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html)
has a positive current account balance (\$4.3222 billion, 2017
estimate), though its foreign reserves further depleted to \$509 billion
(December 2017 estimate), and a zero inflation rate (in fact, -0.2% in
2017). With oil prices stabilizing at \$70 per barrel,
**[funding]{.underline}** for 'Vision 2030' **[seems to pose no big
problem]{.underline}**. Foreign investors usually feel comfortable to
inject money and participate in the development projects of the Kingdom,
notwithstanding a recent decline in foreign direct investments (FDI) due
to worries about the future of 'Vision 2030'. At the same time, a number
of respectable [foreign index
providers](https://www.ft.com/content/d6281742-7589-11e8-a8c4-408cfba4327c),
such as MSCI and FTSE Russell have given Saudi Arabia emerging market
status. This is expected to facilitate FDI inflows to the Kingdom. On
top of that, **[the Kingdom has an abundant supply of cheap
labor]{.underline}** -- a total of 10 million foreign workers who work
for a minimum wage and enjoy few basic rights. The [rights-less and
often
abused](https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/07/13/bad-dreams/exploitation-and-abuse-migrant-workers-saudi-arabia)
foreign laborers are working hard to modernize Saudi Arabia on the same
scale the Indian plantation workers and slave African labor respectively
contributed to the development of the United Kingdom and the United
States in the 19th and early 20th centuries. **[The]{.underline}** real
**[obstacles to implementing 'Vision 2030' are]{.underline}**, however,
**[structural. The basic nature of the Saudi state,]{.underline}**
deemed a federation of powerful tribes based on a bond between the
Al-Saud royal family and the Wahhabi clerics, **[is hardly favorable to
modernization]{.underline}** efforts. The Wahhabi clerics represent the
[school of Muslim
traditionalism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09700161.2017.1377899?journalCode=rsan20)
with discernible biases for textual interpretations of the Qur'an and
the Hadiths (sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad) and an anti-science
posture. **[They are]{.underline}** generally **[opposed to rationalist
philosophy and scientific reasoning]{.underline}** but expect the state
to defend the Islamic faith. Though Mohammad bin Salman has so far
managed to keep the Wahhabi clerics quiet on his transformation drive,
it is uncertain how long he can keep them on board. The **[clerics are
known for their anti-women attitudes]{.underline}** and their die-hard
efforts to keep women out of the public sphere. Women make up half of
the Saudi population and the recent recognition of their right to drive
is just the tip of the ice-berg. More critical **[issues
like]{.underline}** achieving **[gender equality and the abolition of
the male guardian system are likely to convulse the society in the
future]{.underline}**. In terms of gender equality, Saudi Arabia
currently ranks 138 (out of a total of 144 countries), according to the
World Economic Forum's [2017 Global Gender Gap
Report](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2017.pdf). The [male
guardian
system](https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/a-new-kingdom-of-saud/)
treats women as sub-humans, as they need permissions of their male
guardians to visit medical facilities, travel inside or outside the
country, to get married or to work. **[This is a big hindrance to
effective labor market participation of Saudi women to modernize the
society -- a prerequisite for 'Vision 2030']{.underline}**. A related
big issue is the exclusion of political modernization from 'Vision
2030'. **[The Saudi political system is highly
restrictive,]{.underline}** often detrimental to citizens' basic rights,
**[and [crackdown on rights
activists](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/saudi-arabia-arrests-human-rights-campaigner-mohammed-al-bajadi-women-right-drive)
is a regular occurrence]{.underline}**. So is the case with
accountability and transparency -- an area not well addressed by Bin
Salman, though he recently arrested prominent royal family members,
businessmen and high profile government employees on [anti-corruption
probe](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/saudi-corruption-crackdown-latest-updates-171106101217290.html)s.
Probably, he cannot afford to ensure transparency as that will deprive
powerful princes of [vested
perks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/world/middleeast/saudi-arabias-grand-plan-to-move-beyond-oil-big-goals-bigger-hurdles.html)
in the economy and seriously challenge his ascendance to power. Economic
modernization is likely to stumble at some point in Saudi Arabia's tight
political system, as demonstrated by the Shah's anti-democratic
rumblings in Iran. **[The education system]{.underline}** of the Kingdom
**[is]{.underline}** equally **[ill-equipped to cater to the needs of
mega development projects]{.underline}**. Over the past years, the
government has invested billions of dollars to improve the educational
quality and competitiveness of Saudi students. Still, instead of
emphasizing STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics),
there are notable biases for religious subjects and memorization while
the 'know how' -- the key to scientific investigations and progress is
missing. According to the
[TIMMS](http://timss2015.org/timss-2015/mathematics/student-achievement/)
(Trends in International Mathematics and Science Studies) 2015 report,
**[Saudi elementary and secondary school students' scores in mathematics
and science are one of the lowest in the world]{.underline}** (just
ahead of Morocco, South Africa and Kuwait at the elementary level and
holds the lowest position at the secondary level). It clearly means that
**[the Kingdom lacks a scientific and technological base to experiment
with mega projects like 'Vision 2030']{.underline}** and that it
entirely depends or continues to depend on imported technologies and
skilled labor to support its development. That sounds dangerous since it
pushes up the development costs and also edges the general Saudi
graduates out of the job markets. **[It]{.underline}** also
**[hamstrings the government's plan to slash the public sector that
absorbs 70% of Saudi employees,]{.underline}** who receive handsome
monthly salaries and have a general dislike for low-paying private
sector jobs. **[The rapid expansion of the private sector, as planned by
'Vision 2030']{.underline}**, to create six million jobs by 2030 to
accommodate the growing army of the unemployed youth **[is likely to
remain a far cry]{.underline}**. Latched onto the domestic structural
problems is a series of **[regional issues]{.underline}** that
**[undercut]{.underline}** the prospects of **[Bin Salman's
modernization program. Two important issues are]{.underline}** the
**[costly foreign military adventures, and the loss of regional markets
for Saudi products]{.underline}**. Since 2015, the Kingdom has been
pursuing 'guns over butter' budgets to secure a dominant position in the
Middle East. After sending troops to Bahrain to protect the Sunni
monarchy against Shias-led pro-democracy forces in 2011, it launched a
war on Yemen in March 2015 and has openly funded the Syrian rebel
groups, particularly the Jaysh al-Islam (Army of Islam) group to corner
its regional archrival Iran and Iran-allied groups. [Defense
spending](http://www.janes.com/article/76607/saudi-arabia-increases-defence-budget)
shot up quickly. The 2016 budget, for example, allocated \$47.76 billion
to the military and security sector but it increased to \$50.9 billion
in 2017 and \$56 billion in 2018 creating constraints to normal
socio-economic development. Last year, the Kingdom, supported by
Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE, imposed a land, sea and air blockade on
Qatar and cut off all commercial and investment relations, giving its
rivals Iran and Turkey to rush in and [capture the
markets](https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-domestic-economy/71107/iran-exports-to-qatar-up-60)
in Qatar. Before the blockade, Saudi Arabia was the principal supplier
to the Qatari markets. Similarly, Saudi Arabia is more or less out of
Iraq and Syria and is losing Yemen gradually after a three years' fight
against the Houthi rebels. In short, Saudi military campaigns and
hostile relations with the neighbors are taking a toll on the economy,
which is putting extra pressures on the successful implementation of
'Vision 2030'.

#### Bin Salman is sabotaging 2030 himself, its doomed

**el-Baghdadi, 2018**

Vision 2030 represents, at its core, a new Saudi social contract. But
**[the way the crown prince is rewriting this contract should give us

#### No Saudi retaliation

3\. **[The Saudis can't quit America]{.underline}** either. After the
murder of the writer Jamal Khashoggi, allies of Crown Prince Mohammed
bin **[Salman
[warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/15/how-much-damage-can-saudi-arabia-do-to-the-global-economy)
that the Saudis could retaliate to any American sanctions. Saudi
officials denounced that option though,
[saying](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/reuters-america-update-2-saudi-arabia-has-no-intention-of-1973-oil-embargo-replay-gaa-tass.html)
there would be no return to the embargo era]{.underline}**. They have
good reasons for that. The 10 million--plus barrels of oil the Saudis
pump every day are far more than the record low of roughly 2 million
barrels a day the kingdom produced in the mid-1980s, when it was trying
to make prices spike. And **[the kingdom needs American customers to
buy]{.underline}** that **[oil]{.underline}** in order **[to fund its
economic diversification strategy,]{.underline}** known as Vision
2030**[. Its political relationship with Washington also constrains its
ability to cut production; after Trump announced new sanctions on
Iranian oil]{.underline}** in fall 2018, **[the Saudi crown prince
[promised](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-05/saudi-crown-prince-to-trump-we-ve-replaced-all-iran-s-lost-oil)
to pump more to keep the market balanced.]{.underline}** However, Saudi
Arabia is [cutting production
again](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-06/saudi-oil-production-cuts-may-stoke-oil-prices-spur-trump-tweets)
after the United States issued waivers to its Iranian sanctions policy.
**[The Saudis have been able to use their oil weapon only when other oil
producers are tapped out]{.underline}**, Wald said. **[With the American
energy sector booming, global markets look very different from the '70s
and '80s.]{.underline}** The Saudi business model has also changed.
Saudi Aramco is no longer "just drilling holes in the ground and pumping
out," Wald said. In 2017, the company [took
over](https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/01/investing/saudi-arabia-buys-largest-oil-refinery-port-arthur/index.html)
the largest oil refinery in the United States. "The Saudis would
essentially be embargoing their own refinery," Wald said. That makes the
overall relationship safer. "The genius maybe of the early Saudi kings
was that they let the oil business be the oil business. They recognized
how important the money that the oil business generated was to their own
power," Wald said. Unlike countries that quickly nationalized their oil
companies, such as Iran or Venezuela, the Saudis transitioned to
national control of their oil resources over many years, without
throwing out the American expertise that made Aramco so profitable to
its owners. Wald is less confident that the current generation of Saudi
leaders will display the same cautious strategy about their assets. A
plan to sell public shares of Aramco, billed as a move to make the
secretive company more transparent, was shelved last year. "There isn\'t
the same sense of patience that some of the older Saudi kings, the
original king and some of his sons, had about this," Wald said. Rather
than opening up, the Saudis have opted, again, for control.

#### They won't manipulate oil, its not in their best interest

**Kemp, 2019**

(John, "Commentary: Saudi Arabia\'s oil weapon doesn\'t work," Reuters,
16 Oct. 2018,
<https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-oil-prices-kemp/commentary-saudi-arabias-oil-weapon-doesnt-work-idUKKCN1MQ1X3>)

**[Saudi Arabia is unlikely to employ its so-called "oil
weapon]{.underline}**" in the diplomatic crisis over the disappearance
of a journalist after visiting the country's consulate in Istanbul.
Experience from **[the last time Saudi Arabia tried to use oil sales as
a diplomatic instrument in 1973/74 shows such action does not work and
the kingdom itself would be the biggest victim.]{.underline}** Despite
some of the impassioned rhetoric in Saudi media, self-interest makes it
improbable the government will retaliate by reducing oil sales or trying
to drive up prices. That has not stopped some veiled **[threats to
weaponise oil]{.underline}** production and prices, but they **[should
be interpreted as an urgent plea for support]{.underline}** and
understanding rather than a serious threat. "If U.S. sanctions are
imposed on Saudi Arabia, we will be facing an economic disaster that
would rock the entire world," according to one heated editorial ("U.S.
sanctions would mean Washington is stabbing itself", Al Arabiya, Oct.
14). "Riyadh is the capital of (global) oil and touching this would
affect oil production before any other vital commodity," the editorial
warned. If the price of oil reaching \$80 a barrel angered U.S.
President Donald Trump, "no one should rule out the price jumping to
\$100, or \$200, or even double that figure", the author said bluntly.
The government's official response has been more circumspect but it
nonetheless warned that it would respond to any action with even greater
retaliation and pointed to the kingdom's "influential and vital role in
the global economy". OIL EMBARGO **[In]{.underline}** October 1973,
**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and the other Arab oil producers
**[announced that they would start cutting production]{.underline}** by
5 percent per month until Israeli forces evacuated from occupied Arab
territories. In addition, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab producers
announced an embargo on oil sales to the United States and a number of
other countries ("OPEC: 25 years of prices and politics", Skeet, 1988).
Global oil supplies had already become tight even before the decisions
to cut production and embargo the United States, mostly as a result of
low real prices during the 1950 and 1960s. Spare production capacity in
the United States, which had been as much as 4 million barrels per day
in 1968, had been used up by March 1972. (Graphic:
[reut.rs/2yGbLTC](https://reut.rs/2yGbLTC)) In this context, the
production cuts and embargo made an already tight market worse, sent oil
prices surging, and produced a huge, short-term revenue windfall for
Saudi Arabia and other oil producers. But **[the policy was a failure in
its own terms, was reversed a few months later, and caused immense
long-term damage to Saudi Arabia and OPEC]{.underline}** that took
decades to reverse. POLICY FAILURE At the most basic level, **[the
policy failed to achieve its stated objective of changing U.S. support
for Israel or forcing Israel to withdraw from]{.underline}** the
occupied **[Palestinian territories]{.underline}**. More seriously for
Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers, **[the surge in
pric]{.underline}**es, which rose again after the Iranian revolution in
1979, **[resulted in]{.underline}** permanent demand destruction and
**[encouragement of alternative suppliers]{.underline}**.

#### Even if they try, it will just backfire

**Kemp, 2019**

(John, "Commentary: Saudi Arabia\'s oil weapon doesn\'t work," Reuters,
16 Oct. 2018,
<https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-oil-prices-kemp/commentary-saudi-arabias-oil-weapon-doesnt-work-idUKKCN1MQ1X3>)

**[The oil weapon does not work]{.underline}**, which is why Saudi
Arabia is unlikely to employ it in the dispute over the disappearance of
Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In the short term, Saudi
Arabia might gain more revenue from a rise in prices than it lost from a
reduction in sales. **[But rising prices would hit the global economy
and consumption hard and threaten a renewed oil market slump within a
year. The weapon cannot be wielded]{.underline}** in a targeted way
**[against specific consuming countries because the oil market is global
and fully integrated]{.underline}**. Restricting supplies to punish some
countries pushes up oil prices for all consumers. Wielding **[the oil
weapon]{.underline}** to pressure the United States **[would impose
bigger costs on China and India, which are the]{.underline}** largest
and **[fastest-growing oil importers]{.underline}** and crucial markets
for the future. **[Saudi Arabia has spent decades marketing itself as a
reliable oil supplier]{.underline}**, especially to customers in Asia,
and any attempt to employ **[the oil weapon would destroy that carefully
crafted reputation]{.underline}**. Saudi Arabia's refining **[customers
would instead turn to Iran, Russia and the United States]{.underline}**
for additional supplies and likely reconsider their long-term dependence
on the kingdom. If Saudi Arabia nonetheless attempted to weaponise oil
production and sales, the resulting surge in prices would prompt another
round of conservation measures cutting long-term demand for its main
product. **[Sharp rises in oil prices would put a renewed focus on
vehicle fuel economy]{.underline}** standards **[as well
as]{.underline}** accelerating the deployment of **[electric
vehicles.]{.underline}** Rising prices and concerns about unreliable
supplies would speed the diffusion of electric vehicles and push oil out
of the transport market just as it was pushed out of heating and power
generation in the 1980s. Saudi Arabia has spent years urging
oil-consuming countries to remember it needs "security of demand" just
as much as they need "security of supply". But **[weaponising oil
production would]{.underline}** break that understanding and **[provoke
a backlash from consuming countries with a concerted effort to reduce
their oil imports]{.underline}**.

#### Oil embargos don't work and backfire- Saudi Arabia would be cautious

**Turak, 2018**

(Natasha, "Saudi Arabia could hike oil prices over the Khashoggi case.
Here's why it would backfire," CNBC, 16 Oct. 2018,
<https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/16/saudi-arabia-could-spike-oil-prices-over-journalist-case--but-it-would-backfire.html>)

But **[the extraordinary move to place a stranglehold on oil
markets]{.underline}** --- one not taken since the Arab oil embargo of
1973 --- **[would ultimately backfire on Saudi Arabia, leading many
analysts to believe it's not a likely course of action. "Riyadh would be
hesitant to go down this route.]{.underline}** While there would
probably be a significant near-term boost to the Kingdom's oil income,
**[pushing oil prices higher would only serve to rile President Trump,"
London-based research consultancy Capital Economics wrote]{.underline}**
in a client note Monday. "The Saudis are determined to remain close with
Washington to preserve its 'anti-Iran' axis." What's more, if history is
any guide, **[oil embargoes are self-defeating]{.underline}**. The 1973
oil embargo, imposed by Arab OPEC members on countries supporting Israel
during that year's Yom Kippur war between Israel and several Arab
states, quadrupled oil prices and led to shortages across the U.S. But
it **[failed to diminish support for Israel and only spurred the
development of alternative energy research and increased exploration in
other markets]{.underline}**. "In addition," Capital Economics wrote,
"higher oil prices would simply encourage other producers to raise
output and grab market share from Saudi Arabia."

#### China won't get involved

Simone **[van Nieuwenhuizen, an Australia-based researcher of
China-Middle East relations at the University of Technology Sydney,
said]{.underline}** China would be "extremely unlikely" to follow US
sanctions if they were levelled against Saudi Arabia, but may not
necessarily increase trade with the country either. "I think **[China is

Centre at the American University in Cairo, said **[China would not want

expand relations if and when US-Saudi ties deteriorate. However, Saudi

Jamal Khashoggi inside its consulate in Istanbul, and I'm sure they will
try to de-escalate during Secretary Pompeo's visit," he said. "It is

economic and security ties with the Kingdom, including considerable
counterterrorism cooperation and the containment of Iran, over this one

#### Saudi Arabia doesn't control the oil market anymore and shocks would hurt them the most 

**Taylor, 2018**

(Adam, "What Trump got wrong about Saudi Arabia's role in global oil
markets," Washington Post, 21Nov. 2018,

But **[when it comes to Saudi domination of the oil
markets,]{.underline}** Trump's **[perception appears to be stuck in the
past]{.underline}** --- in particular, the 1973 oil crisis, during which
a group of Middle Eastern states refused to sell oil to the United
States, which resulted in shortages and increased prices. Writing for
[The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/16/saudi-arabia-hinted-at-a-u-s-oil-embargo-its-not-1973/?utm_term=.4d7799146cbf)
last month, Jeff **[Colgan, an oil politics expert at Brown University,
argued that the way the oil market works had changed
dramatically]{.underline}** since 1973, meaning that **[any future
embargoes would have less impact. The system has become more flexible,
less reliant on long-term contracts]{.underline}**, so it is easy for a
consumer to get imports from another producer at short notice**[. The
United States also has been producing more oil itself and imports only a
small amount of Saudi oil.]{.underline}** Even though Saudi Arabia would
be able to affect the price of oil in the short term, Colgan wrote,
Riyadh would be cautious about the long-term effect. "It encourages
other producers, including those in the United States, to produce more,"
he wrote. "Over time, that brings the price down while simultaneously
eating into Saudi Arabia's market share." Ellen Wald, author of "[Saudi,
Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom's Pursuit of Profit and
Power](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B074D4YPDQ&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_QIy9BbQ19B7WX&tag=thewaspos09-20),"
argued that **[Saudi Arabia had no plausible leverage over the United
States. "If Riyadh directed the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, to
halt exports to the United States today, it would primarily hurt Aramco
itself,"]{.underline}** Wald wrote [in the New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/opinion/saudi-arabia-economy-united-states.html),
noting that Aramco owns the largest refinery in the United States. It's
likely that **[Saudi Arabia's royals know this]{.underline}**. After
Aldakhil's al-Arabiya commentary was published, the Saudi Embassy in
Washington moved to [distance the government from his
stance](https://twitter.com/aliShihabi/status/1051516572790124545). A
statement released on the same day by the official Saudi Press Agency
offered only a far more vague warning. "The Kingdom also affirms that if
it receives any action, it will respond with greater action, and that
the Kingdom's economy has an influential and vital role in the global
economy," that
[statement](https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&newsid=1827989#1827989)
said. If Saudi Arabia has doubts about its economic worth to the United
States, it should be thankful that Trump apparently does not share them.
The U.S. leader has repeatedly inflated the value of arms deals with
Saudi Arabia. Now, despite the global outrage over Khashoggi's killing,
he continues to insist that Saudi oil is vital to U.S. economic
prosperity.

### AT: Saudi Nukes

#### No Saudi nukes 

**Frantzman, 2018**

(Seth J., "ANALYSIS: SAUDI ARABIA WON\'T BUILD A NUCLEAR BOMB," The
Jerusalem Post, 22 March 2018,
<https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Analysis-Saudi-Arabia-wont-build-a-nuclear-bomb-546834>)

Now, members of Congress are throwing cold water on any deal the Trump
administration might make with Saudi Arabia about enriching uranium for
nuclear power generation. **[There's one problem with all the hype:
Saudi Arabia is years from getting anywhere close to a nuclear
weapon.]{.underline}** The crown prince's discussions about a nuclear
weapon to counter Iran is not the first time the Saudis have been
pressed on this issue. Prince Turki al-Faisal, a diplomat, said in 2014
that the kingdom needed nuclear "know-how" to counter Iran. In 2015,
during the lead-up to the Iran deal, there was buzz about a Riyadh "arms
race" with Iran. Saudi ambassador to the US Adel Al-Jubeir was asked
about his country building a bomb. "This is not something we would
discuss publicly," he told CNN. "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will take
whatever measures are necessary to protect our security." Pundit Fareed
Zakaria pointed out in 2015 that Riyadh's plans were smoke and mirrors.
"Saudi Arabia hasn't even built a car," he noted. "The country's
education system is backward and dysfunctional," he asserted, claiming
that it relies on foreign workers for most things. The kingdom first
began exploring a nuclear power program in August 2009 and it set up the
King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy in 2010 to develop
plans for the future. In 2011, Riyadh announced plans to build 16
nuclear reactors over 20 years. Construction was supposed to begin in
2016, according to an article by the World Nuclear Association**[. Saudi
Arabia is a signatory of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear
Weapons and has met the safeguards related to the treaty]{.underline}**.
While it envisioned its first nuclear power plants providing electricity
by 2032, according to reports, estimates now think they wouldn't be
ready until 2040. Nevertheless, according to an article by the Nuclear
Threat Initiative last year, **[Saudi Arabia has made agreements with
France, Argentina, South Korea and Kazakhstan regarding nuclear
cooperation. "There is no credible evidence that Saudi Arabia has ever
seriously pursued a nuclear weapon program,"]{.underline}** the Nuclear
Threat Initiative wrote. Therefore, the **[stories about a "nuclear arms
race," are largely an illusion]{.underline}**. There is no race. Iran
has a sophisticated nuclear program at numerous sites which goes back
decades. It has uranium mines, three uranium-enrichment plants and a
nuclear reactor. Construction at the Bushehr-1 reactor in Iran first
broke ground in 1975 but wasn't opened until 2011. Iran has plans for
numerous more reactors. **[Other countries' nuclear programs generally
took years to build a weapon. Pakistan's began in 1972 and the first
test was in 1998]{.underline}**; North Korea's took from 1963 to 2006;
India's from 1967 to 1998; UK's from 1940 to 1952; China's from 1958 to
1964; France's from 1945 to 1960. Saudi Arabia is mostly paying lip
service to the Iran nuclear arms race issue as a way to get the US to
take the Iranian threat seriously. This may have backfired a bit,
because Saudi Arabia's enemies in the region, including Iran and
increasingly Qatar as well, have sought to portray the crown prince as
stoking "instability," "unrest" and removing "consensus" in the kingdom.
After the nuclear issue came up on the eve of the crown prince's major
visit to the US, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the chairwoman of the House
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, said that "the idea of Saudi Arabia having
a nuclear program with the ability to enrich is a major national
security concern." But **[long before Saudi Arabia gets anywhere close
to a nuclear weapon there would be serious ramifications]{.underline}**
in the region. Any concerns that countries might have with **[the threat
would therefore only exist in]{.underline}** a matter of years, if not
**[a decade]{.underline}**.

### AT: ME Wars

#### No Middle East war and no great power involvement

Ekaterina **Stepanova 16**, researcher at the Institute of World Economy
and International Relations, Summer 2016, "Russia in the Middle East:
Back to a "Grand Strategy" -- or Enforcing Multilateralism?,"
http://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_PE_162_0023\--russia-in-the-middle-east.htm

[**In contrast** to]{.underline} the 20th century and [the early years
of the 21st century, the]{.underline} [regional crisis in the
2010s]{.underline} [developed]{.underline} at a time [when]{.underline},
overall, [the **role and leverage of major powers** external to the
Middle East, as]{.underline} either [active meddlers or security
guarantors]{.underline} in the region, or both, actually [**declined
rather than increased**. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[serves as the most evident case in point]{.underline}: the
"post-interventionist" US administration has clearly become "tired of
the Middle East", struggling and often failing to keep pace with the
dynamically changing situation and unable to alter or decisively affect
the course of events. [The same even more strongly applies to the
European powers]{.underline}. In terms of activity and impact,
**[regional actors]{.underline}** (Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and
Turkey) increasingly [appeared to outplay external powers and
influence]{.underline}.

For external powers, however, that did not remove a number of risks and
threats connected to, or emanating from, the Middle East. The increase
and diversification of global energy supply and the latest crisis in
energy prices made the region less central to the global economy than it
had been in the past. At the same time, the fundamental socio-political,
statehood and security crisis in the Middle East brought with it new
security concerns and implications. They mostly stemmed from reinforced
perceptions about the long-term nature of regional instability, the
continuing potential for further destabilization, and the related
consequences and implications beyond the region, ranging from terrorist
connections to migration flows. These challenges affect external powers
unevenly. For instance, the role of the Iraq-Syria area as the main
focal point for global terrorism activity and magnet for transnational
flows of violent extremists in the mid-2010s poses a threat to everyone
(but mostly to the countries of the region itself, as well as to those
in Europe and Eurasia). In contrast, the avalanche of refugee and
migrant flows from the Middle East primarily targets Europe (rather than
North America, Eurasia, or other regions).

Until recently, [the main]{.underline} type of [response by
key]{.underline} (Western) [external powers to turbulent developments in
the Middle East]{.underline}, while not amounting to a hands-off
approach, [boils down to **limited containment**]{.underline}. Examples
range from limited air strikes against "Islamic State" positions in Iraq
and Syria, carried out by the US-led coalition since 2014, to the 2013
deal on Syria's chemical disarmament co-brokered by the United States
and Russia. Not surprisingly, this limited-containment approach has had
equally limited results for Syria, Iraq and the region -- as well as for
the West itself (as shown, e.g., by the persistent migrant flows and
accelerating terrorist attacks in Europe). [Despite the growing
centrality of the Middle East to global politics and
security]{.underline}, and its more direct impact on and ties to the
West, [this **damage limitation** course taken by key external actors
has not been very different from]{.underline}, e.g., [the approach taken
by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its Western allies
(and also by [Russia and China) to]{.underline} the
[Afghanistan]{.underline} problem in recent years.

#### No escalation or US draw-in

**Tabatabai '17** \-\-- master's degree in Middle East Politics at the
School of Oriental and African Studies / University of London

(Adnan Tabatabai, 2-9-2017, \"Why Iran-US war of words won\'t turn
physical,\" Al-Monitor,
http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/iran-us-war-words-trump-escalating-rhetoric.html)

But [escalating rhetoric aside, the reality is that US policy toward
Iran has **largely remained intact.** In the 13 months
since]{.underline} the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action ([JCPOA]{.underline}), [Iran has repeatedly conducted ballistic
missile tests]{.underline}. [And it is entitled to do so]{.underline}.
In UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2231, which endorses the
nuclear deal, Iran is \"called upon\" not to carry out tests of missiles
\"designed\" to carry nuclear weapons. There is no legally binding
prohibition of such launches, unlike in UNSCR 1929 --- the last and most
harsh UN resolution against Iran over its nuclear program --- which is
superseded by UNSCR 2231. To be clear, [the nuclear deal does not
address Iran\'s missile program]{.underline}. Moreover, the world powers
with which Iran negotiated UNSCR 2231 --- apart from the United States
--- did not display any appetite to insert legally binding text on
Iran\'s missile tests. Thus, as provocative as the missile tests may be,
it is hard to see them providing a legal basis for the United States to
spearhead new multilateral sanctions, leaving Washington with the option
of adopting unilateral sanctions, which it did on Feb. 3. While it took
the Trump administration less than two weeks to slap sanctions on Iran,
the idea that there was a sanctions freeze in Obama\'s final year in
office is inaccurate. In fact, the latest sanctions were prepared by the
previous administration. In January 2016, not long after the
implementation of the nuclear deal, changes were made to the Visa Waiver
Program, which excluded Iranian dual nationals and anyone who had
visited Iran in the preceding five years. Moreover, last December, Obama
refrained from moving to veto the congressional vote on a 10-year
extension of the Iran Sanctions Act. While these sanctions are unrelated
to Iran\'s nuclear program, they undoubtedly undermine the impact of the
lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. [Iran has reacted to the
escalating rhetoric and sanctions by stressing that its missile program
is defensive in nature, promising retaliatory sanctions, and by carrying
out new military drills]{.underline}. Yet, [there is **little
incentive** for Iran to greatly alter the status quo. Iranian leaders
see the JCPOA as much more than just about the United States. It is an
international arrangement with world powers]{.underline} --- including
the European Union, which Iran holds in high regard as a multinational
institution. [They see this arrangement as beneficial to Iran\'s
economic and security calculations]{.underline}. Foreign investment,
albeit limited due to remaining US sanctions, is trickling in. The EU
oil embargo has been lifted and major contracts in the area of
petrochemicals, civic aviation and transport are increasingly sealed.
Additionally, [the JCPOA provides a sense of security to Iran. It is
**highly unlikely** for any party to the agreement to **green-light
military action** by another party against Iran]{.underline}. Hence,
[Iran has little incentive not to abide by the nuclear
deal.]{.underline} As such, while the cycle of escalating rhetoric is
discomforting at a time of deep uncertainty and conflict in the Middle
East, [it is important to see that it has its limits]{.underline}. Short
of outright regime change, the United States has in fact rather limited
options to weaken and contain Iran. [Given]{.underline} its experiences
in places like [Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}, [it is unlikely that
the United States will launch full-scale unilateral military action
against Iran]{.underline}. It could move to arm a third country to hit
Iranian infrastructure. This was tried with Iraq under Saddam Hussein.
Today, Saudi Arabia could be such a third country. But given the lack of
appetite in Riyadh for direct confrontation with Tehran, and considering
the downward spiral in the Saudi military intervention against Yemen ---
the poorest country in the region --- it is unthinkable that Saudi
Arabia would take such a step. Israel has repeatedly threatened to
attack Iranian nuclear sites. But considering the low chances of success
and the potentially dire consequences, including retaliatory attacks by
Lebanon\'s Hezbollah movement, it can be argued that such threats
primarily serve a political purpose. Less costly measures aimed at
weakening and containing Iran, such as sanctions, have been tried and
tested. The Obama administration managed to put in place an
unprecedented multilateral sanctions regime targeting Tehran. Yet, it
was under those very sanctions that Iran's nuclear program evolved into
what the international community came to perceive as a major threat to
global security. Consequently, the Obama administration tried diplomacy.
And it worked. The JCPOA reduced the capacity and increased the
transparency of Iran\'s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of
nuclear-related sanctions. And [as the International Atomic Energy
Agency has repeatedly certified, the deal is working.]{.underline}
Bearing in mind the nuclear deal is fulfilling its objectives, the
limited military options to contain Iran, and perhaps most of all the
likely US inability to forge an international consensus against Iran in
case of its unilateral breach of the accord, the security establishments
of both Israel and Saudi Arabia have publicly urged Washington not to
dismantle the JCPOA. While reveling in the newfound reassurances from
Washington, it can thus be argued that [Riyadh and Tel Aviv understand
the limits of the cycle of escalation]{.underline} and mostly take
solace in Trump\'s unwillingness to realize their nightmares under
Obama. In this vein, the Trump administration can be expected to do
whatever it can to minimize the economic benefits Iran will reap under
the JCPOA. It will likely seek to discredit Iran\'s regional policies to
prevent the normalization of the Islamic Republic\'s ties with the
world, while also diminishing the political capital the deal affords
Iran. But it will do this short of breaching the accord. Thus, while
likely to squabble about respective obligations and further drift away
from rapprochement, [neither Iran nor the United States has the
incentive or ability to take the new cycle of tension to a military
confrontation.]{.underline}

#### Instability and wars are inevitable in the Middle East - no one factor is the key

**Kapusnak, 2019**

(Jan, "THERE IS NO KEY TO MIDDLE EAST STABILITY," The Jerusalem Post, 18
March 2019,
<https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/There-is-no-key-to-Middle-East-stability-583849>)

For decades, many foreign policy officials, academics and
**[commentators]{.underline}** across the West and the Arab world
**[have argued that there is a key to stability and peace in the Middle
East]{.underline}**. For generations, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
has been portrayed as the key to making regional peace. Proponents of
this concept have claimed that a solution of the protracted conflict
would pave the way to Middle East peace, less terrorism and less
anti-Americanism, and would eliminate Iran's regional expansionism and
nuclear pursuits. According to this logic, if Palestinians had a state,
all the Arab countries would become secular constitutional democracies
run by rulers respecting human rights, Turkey would guarantee the right
of self-determination to Kurds, Iran would cut support for its proxies,
and militant Salafists would call off their jihad. **[There is no
similar case in diplomatic history that was so misunderstood by so many
entities for such a long time]{.underline}**. Roots of this belief can
be traced back to British foreign policy by the end of the 1930s. The
British believed that their concerns in the region -- such as access to
oil, their relations with the individual Arab countries, undercutting
French positions and keeping Nazi Germany from gaining more of a
foothold -- would play out once the problem of Palestine was solved to
the satisfaction of the Arab countries. After the Yom Kippur War and the
subsequent OPEC oil embargo, US presidents started repeating this
"Israeli-Palestinian conflict key to peace" mantra, which became
conventional wisdom in the White House. Jimmy Carter, influenced by
Zbigniew Brzezinski, his national security adviser, formulated that "the
US has a vital interest in the establishment of a stable peace in the
Middle East" via solving the Israeli-Arab conflict. Even in 2008, after
the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War (one of the deadliest conventional wars ever
fought), the Gulf War and the Iraq War, Carter claimed that "without
doubt, the path to peace in the Middle East goes through Jerusalem," and
Brzezinski added that "the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the single
most combustible and galvanizing issue in the Arab world." Although this
myth was discredited by other violent events connected with the Arab
Spring, including the Syrian civil war and the genocide of Yazidis by
ISIS, Donald Trump (the same applies for Barack Obama) repeated it --
thus effectively denying his 2017 National Security Strategy -- in
saying that "if we can make peace between the Palestinians and Israel, I
think it'll lead to ultimately peace in the Middle East, which has to
happen." Unfortunately, this is not going to happen, since **[there is
no key to Middle East peace. This myth is based on the false assumption
that the Middle East is a highly interconnected structure where the
solution of one specific armed conflict will solve a bunch of other
armed conflicts.]{.underline}** However, **[the Middle
East]{.underline}**, regardless of how one defines it, **[is an
ethnically and religiously heterogeneous region characterized by many
complexities and fault lines which throughout the years have produced
multiple intrastate, interstate and transnational armed conflicts among
countries and violent non-state actors, each of which holds competing,
overlapping and sometimes contradictory interests. Any attempt to
simplify affairs in the region and analyze them through the lens of one
particular conflict]{.underline}** (currently via the proxy conflict
between Saudi Arabia and Iran) **[creates the impression that all
conflicts in the region]{.underline}**, their sources and solutions
**[are connected]{.underline}** and not independent. **[THIS WISHFUL
thinking]{.underline}** about some kind of domino effect in the volatile
Middle East has proved to be a very dangerous game with disastrous and
long-lasting consequences. For example, US president G.W. Bush,
influenced by neoconservatism, launched a war in Iraq, in the belief
that regime change in the country would be a catalyst for stimulating
democratic change that would "domino" throughout the Middle East. Henry
Kissinger, former US secretary of state, even linked the Iraq invasion
with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, claiming: "It is not true that
the road to Baghdad leads through Jerusalem. Much more likely, the road
to Jerusalem will lead through Baghdad." However, the hope for a
democratic Baghdad, and so ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, did
not materialize, and post-invasion Iraq has become a repellent example
of a failed state defined by widespread political violence, disorder and
leadership with authoritarian tendencies. Moreover, by ridding Iraq of
Saddam Hussein, Washington inadvertently eliminated Tehran's overriding
challenge, thus allowing it to project its influence in Iraq. The Arab
Spring demonstrated that the notion of democratic dominoes in the region
is a mirage. Early hopes for positive shifts in Middle Eastern politics,
while ignoring the lack of democratic tradition, influence of Islamism,
the weakness of secular forces and widespread poverty, were profoundly
misplaced. Although the upheavals in 2011 had similar roots, that does
not mean that their outcomes must be the same. The Tunisian revolution
inspired other countries to revolt. Regrettably, its relatively
successful transition into "flawed democracy" did not become an
inspiration for other countries, such as Syria and Libya, which, rather,
descended into civil wars. In February 2019, US Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo said that "confronting Iran" is the key to stability and peace in
the Middle East. In truth, increasingly powerful Iran destabilizes the
region with its pursuit of regional hegemony, characterized inter alia
by a policy of systematic interference in other countries -- such as
Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen -- through the sponsorship of local Shia
militias. Iran has mastered the art of proxy wars. Although it is
important to stop Iran's aggressive expansionism and prevent it from
building a contiguous sphere of influence from its Western border to the
Mediterranean, that still will not be enough to bring stability, let
alone peace, to the region. Even if Iran abandons the states, there
still will be conflicts ongoing on their soils. Iran is an opportunistic
player that looks for vacuums in failed states, exploits sectarian
conflicts to increase its influence, while using Shi'ism as the main
tool to attract foreigners to cooperate. These **[countries will remain
fragmented and deeply divided]{.underline}**, even without Tehran's
presence. Needless to say, other countries with hegemonic ambitions in
the region -- namely, Turkey and Saudi Arabia -- have not contributed to
stability either. The list of their stability-undermining activities is
difficult to fathom. Turkey invaded northern Syria in order to prevent
the creation of a Kurdish state. Saudi Arabia trapped itself in the
civil war in Yemen, after invading it in August 2015; and, together with
other Gulf countries, it has helped to worsen conflicts in Syria and
Libya. Russian intentions in the region are far from being a salvation.
Russia tries to brand itself as a problem solver; however, its
conflict-mediation strategy tends to be effective in freezing disputes
rather than solving them. This approach is evident in conflicts that
Russia tried to handle, specifically in Abkhazia, Chechnya, South
Ossetia, Transnistria or Ukraine. Pursuing stability in the current
Middle East seems to be chimerical. **[The region is going
through]{.underline}** a time of perhaps **[unprecedented instability
and turmoil -- all enabled by the fact that the region lacks a
collective security framework of any kind that would guide local actors
to manage]{.underline}** inevitable **[disputes]{.underline}** with
minimal violence and disruption. **[The current regional order is
fundamentally one of disorder, and pointing out one simplistic frame
obscures from view the complex issues plaguing the region. There is not
one key to stability in the Middle East]{.underline}**. It is not the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, democratic Iraq or pacified Iran.
Stability requires multiple keys to multiple issues, what seems to be a
Sisyphean task just to imagine, let alone to do.

[Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary
conflict]{.underline}? Or might downturns encourage austerity and
economizing behavior in foreign policy? [This paper provides new
evidence that economic stress is associated with **conciliatory
policies** between strategic rivals]{.underline}. [For states that view
each other as military threats, the **biggest step possible toward
bilateral cooperation** is to terminate the rivalry by taking political
steps to manage the competition]{.underline}. [Drawing on **data from
109 distinct rival dyads** since 1950]{.underline}, [67 of which
terminated]{.underline}, [the evidence suggests rivalries were
approximately **twice as likely** to terminate during economic downturns
than they were during periods of economic normalcy]{.underline}. [This
is true **controlling for all of the main alternative explanations** for
peaceful relations between foes]{.underline} ([democratic
status]{.underline}, [nuclear weapons]{.underline} possession,
[capability imbalance]{.underline}, [common enemies]{.underline}, and
[international systemic changes]{.underline}), as well as many other
possible confounding variables. This research questions existing
theories claiming that economic downturns are associated with
diversionary war, and instead argues that in certain circumstances peace
may result from economic troubles. [I define a rivalry as the perception
by national elites of two states that the other state possesses
conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient
severity that future military conflict is likely]{.underline}. [Rivalry
termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where
conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke
interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance
in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures
unlikely]{.underline}. In other words, [rivalries terminate when the
elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has
been reduced dramatically]{.underline}. This definition draws on a
growing quantitative literature most closely associated with the
research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph Hewitt, and James P.
Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My definition conforms to that
of William Thompson. In work with Karen Rasler, they define rivalries as
situations in which "\[b\]oth actors view each other as a significant
politicalmilitary threat and, therefore, an enemy."2 In other work,
Thompson writing with Michael Colaresi, explains further: The
presumption is that decisionmakers explicitly identify who they think
are their foreign enemies. They orient their military preparations and
foreign policies toward meeting their threats. They assure their
constituents that they will not let their adversaries take advantage.
Usually, these activities are done in public. Hence, we should be able
to follow the explicit cues in decisionmaker utterances and writings, as
well as in the descriptive political histories written about the foreign
policies of specific countries.3 Drawing from available records and
histories, Thompson and David Dreyer have generated a universe of
strategic rivalries from 1494 to 2010 that serves as the basis for this
project's empirical analysis.4 This project measures rivalry termination
as occurring on the last year that Thompson and Dreyer record the
existence of a rivalry. [Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior
through five primary channels]{.underline}. (1) Economic crises lead to
austerity pressures, which in turn incent leaders to search for ways to
cut defense expenditures. (2) Economic crises also encourage strategic
reassessment, so that leaders can argue to their peers and their publics
that defense spending can be arrested without endangering the state.
This can lead to threat deflation, where elites attempt to downplay the
seriousness of the threat posed by a former rival. (3) If a state faces
multiple threats, economic crises provoke elites to consider threat
prioritization, a process that is postponed during periods of economic
normalcy. (4) Economic crises increase the political and economic
benefit from international economic cooperation. Leaders seek foreign
aid, enhanced trade, and increased investment from abroad during periods
of economic trouble. This search is made easier if tensions are reduced
with historic rivals. (5) Finally, during crises, elites are more prone
to select leaders who are perceived as capable of resolving economic
difficulties, permitting the emergence of leaders who hold heterodox
foreign policy views. [**Collectively**, these mechanisms make it much
more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to
during periods of economic normalcy]{.underline}. This section reviews
this causal logic in greater detail, while also providing historical
examples that these mechanisms recur in practice. **[Economic Crisis
Leads to Austerity]{.underline}** Economic crises generate pressure for
austerity. [Government revenues are a function of national economic
production, so that when production diminishes through recession,
revenues available for expenditure also diminish]{.underline}. [Planning
almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the
deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can
be **sizable**]{.underline}. When growth slowdowns are prolonged, the
cumulative departure from planning targets can grow even further, even
if no single quarter meets the technical definition of recession.
Pressures for austerity are felt most acutely in governments that face
difficulty borrowing to finance deficit expenditures. [This is
especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources
of credit]{.underline}. Even for states that can borrow, however,
[intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore
confidence]{.underline}---a belief in what is sometimes called
"expansionary austerity"---[generates incentives to curtail
expenditure]{.underline}. [These incentives to cut occur precisely when
populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions
especially painful that target]{.underline} poverty alleviation,
[welfare]{.underline} programs, or economic subsidies. As a result, mass
and elite constituents strongly resist such cuts. Welfare programs and
other forms of public spending may be especially susceptible to a policy
"ratchet effect," where people are very reluctant to forego benefits
once they have become accustomed to their availability.6 As Paul Pierson
has argued, "[The politics]{.underline} \[[of welfare
state]{.underline}\] [retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it
imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters]{.underline} in
return for diffuse and uncertain gains."7 Austerity Leads to Cutbacks in
Defense Spending At a minimum, the political costs of pursuing austerity
through cutbacks in social and economic expenditures alone make such a
path unappealing. In practice, [this can spur policymakers to curtail
national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of
economic turmoil]{.underline}. [There is often more discretion over
defense spending than over other areas in the budget]{.underline}, [and
it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass
public]{.underline}. Many militaries need foreign arms and foreign
ammunition for their militaries, so defense expenditures are doubly
costly since they both take up valuable defense budget space while also
sending hard currency overseas, rather than constituencies at home.
[Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the
financial sector, which shows a **strong aversion** to military
conflict]{.underline} even if that means policies of appeasement and
conciliation.8 During periods of economic expansion, the opportunity
costs associated with defense expenditure---the requirement for higher
taxes or foregone spending in other areas---are real but acceptable.
[Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a
choice between different types of spending]{.underline}. [There is a
constituency for defense spending]{.underline} in the armed services,
intelligence agencies, and arms industries, [but]{.underline} **[even in
militarized economies]{.underline}** [this constituency tends to be
numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic
expenditures over military ones.]{.underline} Defense Cutbacks Encourage
Rapprochement An interest in defense cutbacks can lead to conciliatory
behavior through two paths. **[First]{.underline}**, [the cutbacks
themselves serve as a **concrete signal** to adversaries that the
military threat posed by the economically distressed state is
declining.]{.underline} [This permits the other state to halt that
portion of defense spending dedicated to keeping up, **breaking the back
of ongoing arms races**]{.underline} through reciprocated, but
non-negotiated moves. [Unilateral conventional force reductions were a
major element of Gorbachev's foreign policy in the late
1980s]{.underline}, alongside negotiated strategic arms control, and
diplomatic efforts to achieve political understandings with the United
States.9 [Gorbachev similarly used force reductions in Afghanistan,
Mongolia, and the Soviet Far East to signal to China in 1987 that he was
serious about political negotiations]{.underline}.10 Elsewhere,
[non-negotiated]{.underline}, tit-for-tat [military redeployments
facilitated Argentina-Brazil rapprochement]{.underline}.11
**[Second]{.underline}**, [leaders may believe cutbacks are necessary,
but would be dangerous in the absence of negotiated improvements with
traditional foes]{.underline}. [Economic downturns can serve as
**motivation to pursue arms control** or political
settlement]{.underline}. During periods of normalcy, such outcomes would
be positives, but are viewed as "too hard" by political leaders that
move from one urgent problem to the next. [During periods of economic
crisis]{.underline}, however, [arms control or political improvements
might allow for much needed cuts in defense spending, and are **pursued
with greater vigor**]{.underline}. The [Johnson]{.underline}
administration [attempted both unilateral and negotiated arms
limitations because of budgetary concerns]{.underline} as President
Johnson and Secretary McNamara struggled to pay for the "Great Society"
domestic programs and the increasingly costly Vietnam War. They first
attempted unilateral "caps" on costly nuclear forces and anti-ballistic
missile defenses and when this failed to lead to a reciprocal Soviet
response they engaged in formal arms control talks. [Détente continued
in the Nixon administration]{.underline}, accelerating in 1971 and 1972,
[simultaneous with rising budget deficits and inflation]{.underline} so
serious that Nixon instituted price controls. [Nixon's decision to
sharply limit anti-ballistic missile defenses to enable arms control
talks was **contrary to his strategic views, but necessitated by a
difficult budgetary environment**]{.underline} that made paying for more
missile defense emplacements unrealistic.12 As Nixon told his national
security advisor Kissinger in an April 1972 discussion of ballistic
missile and anti-ballistic missile developments: "You know we\'ve got a
hell of a budget problem. We\'ve got to cut it down, we\'ve got to cut 5
billion dollars off next year\'s defense budget. So, I don\'t want to
\[inaudible: do it?\] unless we\'ve got some settlement with the
Russians."13 In practice, [unilateral defense cuts and force reductions
are frequently combined with negotiated political agreements in a
sequential, iterative fashion, where a unilateral reduction will
**signal seriousness** that opens the way for political
agreement]{.underline}, [which in turn permits **even deeper
reductions**]{.underline}. Defense cuts and force reductions are not
only a means to achieve rivalry termination, but also a goal in and of
themselves that rivalry termination helps secure. Leaders are seeking
resources from defense they can use elsewhere. Thus when Argentine
leader Raul Alfonsín campaigned for the need for drastic budgetary
austerity, his specific "platform was the reduction of military spending
to use it for the other ministries, connected with the concept of
eliminating the hypothesis of conflict" with Argentinian rivals,
according to Adalberto Rodríguez Giavarini, who served in Alfonsín's
ministry of defense (and later was Argentina's foreign minister).14
Similarly, Gorbachev was motivated to reduce arms in the late 1980s
because he determined it was necessary to cut Soviet defense spending
and defense production, and repurpose part of the defense industry to
make consumer and civilian capital goods, according to contemporary U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency classified assessments.15 [Thus the "**main
reason**" why strategic arms control breakthroughs occurred from 1986 to
1988 and the Soviet Afghan intervention concluded in 1989 was a
realization within the Politburo of "excessively high expenditures on
defense," according to Nikolai Ryzhkov, Gorbachev's prime
minister]{.underline}.16 **[Economic Downturns Provoke Strategic
Reassessment]{.underline}**: [Threat Deflation and
Prioritization]{.underline} [Economic downturns encourage leaders to
seek new ideas to use to frame their policy problems]{.underline}.
During periods of economic difficulty, elites can come to realize that
their problems are not amenable to old solutions, and search for new
ideas.17 [During an economic crisis, politics and policy are "**more
fluid**," as old answers seem stale and insufficient]{.underline}.18 [An
ideational entrepreneur that can link economic **lemons** to foreign
policy **lemonade** can find a patron when leaders are casting about for
ways to reframe the world in acceptable ways to their peers and
publics]{.underline}. The behavior of an old foe is often ambiguous, and
can be viewed as either injurious to one's interests or neutral toward
them. During periods of normalcy, the motivation of defense
establishments is tilted toward threat and danger. [During periods of
economic crisis, national leaders have a counteracting motivation to
**downplay such dangers**, so that the threats faced by a nation are
manageable through available resources]{.underline}. Economic
difficulties provide a motivation for leaders to view equivocal signals
from the international system in a way that is benign. To the extent
that [rivalries are perpetuated because of threat inflation, economic
downturns provide incentives to deflate the threat, potentially
**disrupting cycles of competition and enmity**]{.underline}. [South
Korean president Kim Dae-jong]{.underline} came to power [in the
aftermath of the 1998 Asian economic crisis, pursued a "sunshine policy"
toward the North]{.underline}, cut South Korean defense spending in
nominal and real terms, and pursued a policy toward North Korea that
political scientist Dong Sun Lee called "threat deflation" despite the
growing North Korean nuclear weapons threat.19 Economic crises can also
spur strategic reassessment through another channel. If leaders view
economic problems as structural, rather than a temporary gale, they may
come to question whether available national resources are sufficient to
confront all of the national threats identified in the past. [This
creates incentives to economize threats, seeking political settlements
where possible in order to focus remaining resources on competitions
that can be won]{.underline}. A concrete example: [in 1904, the
chancellor to the Exchequer wrote]{.underline} his cabinet colleagues:
["\[W\]e must frankly admit that the financial resources of the United
Kingdom are inadequate to do all that we should desire in the matter of
Imperial defense."]{.underline}20 [The result was a British decision to
minimize political disagreement with the United States]{.underline} and
focus on other defense challenges. While such a decision is in line with
realist advice, it occurred not when the power trajectories were evident
to British decisionmakers but when the budget situation had reached a
crisis that could no longer be ignored. Economic Downturns Increase
Incentives for International Economic Cooperation [Economic
downturns]{.underline} not only create incentives to cut spending, they
[encourage **vigorous pursuit** of opportunities for economic
cooperation]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, too, [can engender
conciliatory behavior]{.underline}. [Economic downturns can **increase
motives to pursue trade** and investment]{.underline}. Rivalries with
old foes often directly impinge on trade and investment with the
adversary and may indirectly impinge on trade and investment with third
parties, especially if the rivalry is viewed as being likely to generate
disruptive military conflict. Additionally, [economic aid is sometimes
used as an inducement for adversaries to set aside a political
dispute]{.underline}. This aid can either serve as a side payment from
one rival to another, or it can be offered by a third party to one or
both rivals as an incentive to set aside lingering disputes. [Such aid
is more attractive during periods of economic turmoil than during
periods of comparative normalcy]{.underline}. In South Asia, [India and
Pakistan struggled from 1947 to 1960 with]{.underline} how to manage
[water]{.underline} resources in the Indus Rivers basin, inheriting a
canal system meant to service pre-partitioned India. [Pakistan,
suffering an economic downturn, and India, reliant on foreign aid to
avert economic crisis, agreed to an Indus Waters Treaty in
1960]{.underline} to resolve the lingering dispute, made possible in
substantial part because of World Bank financing that was especially
attractive to the struggling economies. In the Middle East, [Egypt and
Israel]{.underline} [made the hard choices necessary for the Camp David
accord in 1979 precisely because the Sadat and Begin governments faced
difficult economic situations]{.underline} at home [that made the U.S.
aid guarantee]{.underline} in exchange for a peace agreement especially
[attractive]{.underline}.21 [In 1982, the Yemen's People's Republic
agreed to stop its attempts to destabilize Oman, because otherwise Yemen
would not receive economic assistance from Arab oil producing
states]{.underline} that it desperately needed.22 In the late
[1990s]{.underline}, [El Niño-induced flooding devastated Ecuador and
Peru, spurring reconciliation as leaders sought to increase trade,
secure investment, and slash military expenditures]{.underline} so they
could be used at home.23 As one Western diplomat assessed at the time,
Ecuador and Peru "have decided it\'s better to see reason.... They see
foreign companies eager to invest in South America, and if Peru and
Ecuador are in conflict, it makes them less attractive than, say,
Argentina or Brazil or Chile for investment purposes. That\'s the last
thing either country wants."24 **[Economic Downturns Can Cause
Meaningful Leadership Change]{.underline}** The above mechanisms have
identified how economic difficulties can alter the preferences of an
incumbent leader. Additionally, [economic crises can lead to leadership
turnover and]{.underline}, during periods of difficulty, [the selection
process that determines new leadership can **loosen ideological
strictures** that relate to extant rivalries]{.underline}. [Leaders may
be selected based on judgments about their ability to cope with economic
problems, with greater elite acceptance of ideological heterogeneity in
foreign policy beliefs]{.underline} than in periods of normalcy.25 In
Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth's words, "If everything is going
well or is stable, then why select leaders who might subvert the
triedand-true identity? But if that identity is leading to increased
material difficulties, pressure for change will likely mount. In these
circumstances, [those who are willing to alter or adjust the hallowed
precepts of the existing identity and its associated practices are more
likely to assume power]{.underline}."26 [Economic crisis, then, can spur
incumbent leaders to either **abandon the "baggage" of rivalry** or
facilitate the selection of new leaders that do not carry such baggage.
The most well-known example of an incumbent selectorate looking for a
reformer]{.underline}, even one without much foreign policy experience,
[involves Mikhail Gorbachev's ascension]{.underline} to the Soviet
premiership. In political scientist Jerry Hough's words, "If the rate of
economic growth continued to decline, if administrative and labor
efficiency continued to fall, if corruption was not punished, these
conditions would have dangerous consequences for the \[Soviet Union in
the\] 1980s and 1990s.... Gorbachev's promotion was an answer to these
concerns."27

University of Virginia, CFA and Director at the CFA Institute, served as
chair of the investment committee for Rockbridge Regional"A Rebalancing
Market Means Higher Oil Prices," 21 March 2017,
http://seekingalpha.com/article/4056976-rebalancing-market-means-higher-oil-prices?page=2)

[The supply/demand equation for global oil markets is in the middle of a
**[major supply-side reset]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that [should
provide]{.mark} **[support for oil prices]{.mark}** going
forward]{.underline}, according to Jennifer Stevenson, a portfolio
manager with 1832 Asset Management L.P. (a subsidiary of Scotiabank).

There are opportunities for North American oil and gas companies, even
if a \"border adjustment tax\" is passed in the United States or the
North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA) is renegotiated, Stevenson
explained to the audience at the CFA Institute Latin America Investment
Conference. [Her research found that [global demand for oil will]{.mark}
**[continue on its upward trajectory]{.mark}**, fueled by growth in
emerging markets]{.underline}.

[Stevenson said that the [excess supply and inventories]{.mark} that
contributed to the collapse in oil prices from 2014 to 2016 [are
now]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[coming down
substantially]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Looking forward,]{.underline}
**[[these reductions will provide price support]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Supply Reduction on the Production Side

Stevenson segmented supply-side sources of oil production into three
buckets: OPEC, North America, and the \"Rest of the World\" (ROW), and
described how each contributes to energy market dynamics.

In the ROW countries, production fell primarily due to the extreme drop
in oil prices, which reduced cash flows and access to capital for
maintaining production levels. An extra 5 million barrels per day (bpd)
of production that was scheduled to come online in 2019-20 was
eliminated by the cancellation of \$1 trillion in international
projects, which means that the additional production effect will be felt
in the future.

[In November 2016, [OPEC]{.mark} signed an agreement to cut 1.2 million
bpd of production, which took effect in January 2017. \"As of the end of
January 2017, they [were]{.mark} **[83% in compliance]{.mark}** [with
the plan]{.mark}, **[which is spectacular]{.mark}**]{.underline},\"
Stevenson said. [The agreement was designed to increase oil prices and
enhance the economies of participating countries, and Stevenson
attributed its adoption to]{.underline} Saudi Arabia\'s deputy crown
prince, [Mohamed bin [Salman]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[who is]{.mark} also
[driving the]{.mark} **[\"Saudi Vision 2030\"
plan]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[designed to]{.mark} **[reduce the
kingdom\'s dependency on oil]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [has]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[strong incentive to
maintain high oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [About **[85%]{.mark}**
[of the country\'s GDP is **tied to oil**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
October 2016, Saudi Arabia raised \$17.5 billion in the largest-ever
bond sale from an emerging market country. [In 2018, [Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [is expected to raise]{.mark} **[\$1 trillion]{.mark}** [in an
IPO for]{.mark} a portion of the country\'s national oil
company]{.underline}, [Saudi [Aramco]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The country
may tap bond markets again, and **[higher oil prices mean a greater
valuation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for the IPO and a]{.mark} **[more
secure bond rating]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

U.S. Energy Self-Sufficiency?

[Although the Donald Trump administration is pushing for US energy
independence, that\'s easier said than done]{.underline}. [The United
States imports **7.6 million bpd**]{.underline}, and of that amount, 3
million bpd come from Canada. The remaining 4.6 million bpd come from
Mexico and other countries. [Adding production]{.underline} means a
commitment of capital for labor, equipment, and infrastructure, which
[would require]{.underline} staying power and, needless to say, [higher
oil prices]{.underline}.

\"The U.S. Republican party left out a word out in their policy platform
to achieve America\'s \'energy independence from foreign suppliers,\'\"
Stevenson said. \"That word is \'North.\'\" She observed that \"it is
possible for the North American energy independence equation to work, if
Canada and Mexico supply all of the gap in US production.\"

Supply Reduction: Global Inventories

[Stevenson sees global inventory draws as another sign that supply and
demand are rebalancing in the right direction]{.underline}. \"[[We are
starting to draw down inventories globally]{.mark}, **[but nobody knows
about it]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" she said. [[The media]{.mark} and
markets [are]{.mark} **[largely fixated on U.S. inventories]{.mark}**,
which are reported twice a week]{.underline}.

\"[[We are headed toward the]{.mark} **[lowest level ever for OECD
inventories]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Stevenson said, \"[and **[this is
very supportive of prices]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" Saudi Arabia, which
is fully aware of the visibility of U.S. inventories and the importance
of location, can assist in further U.S. inventory reduction by reducing
supplies to the United States.

Technology Driving the Sector\'s Improved Efficiency and Profitability

Stevenson explained that fracking and other technological advances,
developed mainly in the United States, have increased the efficiency of
capital and raised profit margins, despite wells costing more. \"Margins
today are as good as when the price per barrel was \$30 higher,\" she
said.

These advances in technology will eventually be applied in other global
reservoirs, particularly in areas like Argentina, which Stevenson says
has a \"fantastic reservoir\" in the Vaca Muerta. Overall, Stevenson
sees the sector adding jobs, but at a lower rate than in the past.

Benefits to North American Oil Companies

[[Stevenson]{.mark} was positive on the energy sector and **[expected
demand growth to continue]{.mark}**. She said that the short cycle
production to feed this demand growth will **most likely come from North
America**.]{.underline}

[And the outlook for oil prices? **[\"OPEC has given us a \$50
floor,\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Stevenson said. Near-term, [she
predicted that]{.mark} **[we will see \$60 per
barrel]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as the ceiling at which more projects
will come in]{.underline}, although there will still be constraints on
labor, equipment, and infrastructure.

\"[In the oil industry today,]{.underline} [\$60 per barrel is better
than \$50, and \$70 is life changing]{.underline},\" Stevenson said. She
is bullish on supply growth in North America over the longer term.
\"[We\'ve canceled \$1 trillion worth of energy spending globally in the
past two years, and OPEC cuts speed up the recovery]{.underline},\" she
noted.

#### Vision 2030 failure causes war and terrorism 

**Karasik '16** (Theodore Karasik -- PhD in History @ UCLA, currently a
Gulf-based analyst of regional geopolitical affairs. Joseph Cozza. "What
If Saudi Arabia Collapses?" 10 August 2016,
https://lobelog.com/what-if-the-state-of-saudi-arabia-collapses/)

[In the event of contentious anti-government uprisings, the monarchy
would feel pressured to offer change]{.underline}. [The most likely
scenario would be the promotion of MBS, a reformer with a great deal of
youth support]{.underline}. [This promotion is]{.underline} **[unlikely
to quell elite resentment]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[could
further inflame tensions]{.underline}** [among the monarchy, rival
family members, and the religious establishment]{.underline}. If MBS
offers liberal reforms, he would likely lose the support of the
ultra-conservative Wahhabi clerics. Yet if he fails to provide reforms,
resistance to the Saudi rulers could grow based on regionalism and
tribalism in the Hijaz, Nejd, or the Eastern Province. [Neither scenario
bodes well for the monarchy]{.underline}. Though he has a loyal
following in the military, [MBS's military excursion in Yemen has
received substantial criticism, **creating the conditions for a coup**
if destabilization escalates under his stewardship]{.underline}.

[Hostile elites with competing clientele bases would see **state
collapse** as an opening for greater power]{.underline}. Since the
kingdom's unification in 1932, an overarching Saudi identity has been
elusive. Saudi nationalism is a new concept. The state has been united
by the cooptation of elites and the promotion of Wahhabi ideology, which
while popular in the Nejd heartland faces rejection from the country's
Shi'ite minority. Not all Saudi Sunnis, meanwhile, practice this branch
of Sunni Islam.

[[With an embattled]{.mark} central [state]{.mark}, many [tribal elites
would]{.mark} **[strive to carve out autonomous
regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [restore their pre-unification
authority, [and]{.mark} potentially]{.underline} **[[dissolve the modern
Saudi state]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To exert their power, these tribal
leaders would draw defections from tribal kin in the armed forces.
Disaffected royal family members with their own loyal bases of support
could also openly challenge King Salman's successor (whoever that will
be) if instability persists.

[In the face of significant social upheaval, elite abandonment, and
military defection, the SANG could not realistically prevent the state
from **sliding into civil war** and **collapse**]{.underline}. GCC
states are aware of this scenario and operational plans to contain this
potential implosion are already under consideration.

Consequences for Region and the World

[[The collapse of]{.mark} the [Saudi]{.mark} state [would have]{.mark}
**[grave implications for the]{.mark} region** and the
**[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As illustrated by Libya, Syria, and
Yemen, [state collapse [creates a]{.mark} **[vacuum for radical jihadist
groups]{.mark}** to claim new territory. Currently]{.underline},
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (**[[AQAP]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[is]{.underline} **[pushing against the Saudi border]{.underline}**
[with Yemen and]{.underline} the Islamic State
(**[[ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark}** or IS) in Iraq and Syria [poses a
constant threat to the kingdom's north]{.underline}. [Thus, civil war,
instability, and high levels of sectarian [tension would likely
be]{.mark} **[fertile ground for these groups]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} grow
and expand their control, threaten the holy sites, and **[perpetuate
regional instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Washington's national
security establishment has expressed concerns about **[turmoil
escalating]{.mark}** in Saudi Arabia **[if MBS's reform agenda
fails]{.mark} to achieve its objectives**]{.underline}. [Some see the
kingdom at a crossroads and fear that [the kingdom's collapse
would]{.mark} **[benefit the Islamic State]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Regarding MBS possibly becoming the next king, one anonymous Saudi
expert told NBC News, "**It's him or it's ISIS**."]{.underline}

The July 4 attacks in three Saudi cities (Medina, Jeddah, and Qatif)
underscored the significance of the militant Salafist-Jihadist threat
not only to the country's security but also Al Saud's prestige and
Islamic legitimacy as the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The
intended attack by IS adherents on the Prophet's Mosque during the end
of Ramadan signals the Islamic State's intent to usurp the Al Saud much
as the apocalyptic leader Juhayman al-Otaybi did when he seized the
Grand Mosque in 1979. "This attack has made it very clear that ISIS does
not seem to believe in any moral red lines whatsoever," said Fahad
Nazer, a leading expert on Saudi Arabia. "Even al-Qaeda, which is
certainly brutal in its own right, has never targeted Muslims in their
houses of worship. ISIS has done that repeatedly."

[[A civil war]{.mark} in the Arabian Peninsula [would]{.mark} also
**[challenge long-standing alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Instability]{.mark}, the threat to the holy cities, and the
possibility of jihadist gains [would encourage]{.mark} states with high
stakes]{.underline} ([**[Egypt]{.mark}**, **[Jordan]{.mark}**,
**[Iran]{.mark}**, **[Pakistan]{.mark}**, **[U.S]{.mark}**.,
etc]{.underline}.) [[to react]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In fact, UAE
officials have even made contingency plans for a potential state
collapse in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, a risk which none of the
kingdom's neighbors can afford to ignore. These states would certainly
move to secure the holy sites and combat terror cells, but solving the
civil war would be a massive challenge. There would be considerable
pressure to support the Saud family, but supporting the Wahhabi
religious establishment over a reform movement would cause domestic
complications in some of these countries that resent the kingdom's
influence across the region.

[[Pakistan]{.mark}, which has a "special bilateral relationship" with
Saudi Arabia obligating their military to defend Mecca and Medina and
protect Saudi Arabia's territorial integrity, [would]{.mark} face the
most **pressure to [intervene militarily]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on
behalf of the Saud government should turmoil intensify.]{.underline} The
two nations have a long history of military and security cooperation,
and [there is little doubt that Pakistan would act to protect the Al
Saud rulers]{.underline}. In addition, the Egyptian military is present
in the northern border areas of Saudi Arabia helping to augment
Pakistani forces supporting SANG and the Saudi border guard.

Iran and Oil

[[The]{.mark} **[geopolitical tsunami]{.mark}** [that would
result]{.mark} from Saudi Arabia's collapse [would have]{.mark}
**[enormous consequences regarding Iranian
influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [across the region]{.underline}. From
Iraq to Lebanon, and from Yemen to Syria, the struggle on the part of
hardline Sunni Islamists to counter Shi'ism and [**Iran's reach would
enter a new phase** should Saudi Arabia cease to exist as a unified
nation-state]{.underline}. It is not entirely clear how Iran would react
to state-collapse in Saudi Arabia, especially considering
[[instability]{.mark} in the region [would present a]{.mark} **[security
risk to shipping]{.mark}** and trade in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}.
Although [Iran]{.underline} would likely avoid direct involvement in a
conflict in the Arabian Peninsula, it [would certainly attempt to
capitalize on a regional power vacuum created by a diminished Saudi
Arabia by consolidating its political and military influence in Yemen,
Iraq, Syria, Eastern Saudi Arabia, and, if instability spreads,
Shi'ite-majority Bahrain]{.underline}. Diminished oil output by its
regional rival would also increase demand for Iranian oil, boosting
their economy. [There is also no clear Sunni successor state to check
Iran's regional influence]{.underline}. Egypt's economy is too weak, and
Jordan is surrounded on all sides by instability.

Finally, [Saudi Arabia as a failed state [would]{.mark} **[send
international markets into free fall]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [State
collapse in Saudi Arabia [would]{.mark} **[halt oil
production]{.mark}**]{.underline}, significantly increasing the price of
oil and [dramatically weakening global economies]{.underline}. [Such an
increase would [spark a]{.mark} **[severe global economic
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The longer Saudi Arabia is destabilized,
the more difficult it would be for the world to pull out of the crisis
and recover]{.underline}. [The [socio-political ramifications]{.mark} of
such an economic shock [could be]{.mark} **[catastrophic]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[disastrous for]{.mark} both the region and
[the world]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [If the government faces large-scale
demonstrations calling for social and political liberalization while
facing tribal, familial, and religious elite abandonment, [the result
could be]{.mark} **[instability]{.mark}**, **[civil war]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark}/or **[state collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Again [[this result is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[far from
inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The Saudis might be able to]{.mark}
**[successfully implement]{.mark} the [Vision 2030]{.mark}
reforms**]{.underline} [while ensuring elite and citizen
support]{.underline}. [[The country must]{.mark} also [be open to course
corrections]{.mark} in the event of economic turmoil or elite resentment
[**in order to prevent instability**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### More Vision 2030 impacts

#### Vision 2030 failure causes [Saudi lash out]{.underline} and attacks against [Iraq]{.underline}, [Yemen]{.underline}, and [Qatar]{.underline}

**Riegg '17** (Ryan Riegg -- JD specializing in finance @ UCLA, author
of multiple law journal articles on Islamic law, "WHAT IS SAUDI ARABIA
GOING TO DO WITH ITS ARMS BUILDUP?" 17 March 2017,
http://www.newsweek.com/what-saudi-arabia-going-do-its-arms-buildup-569277?rx=us)

The result is that, despite its many reform efforts over the years,
[nearly **90 percent** of Saudi's export economy **remains based on
oil**]{.underline}. Thus, as discussed in "Why the Saudis May Be
Preparing for a Real War," [due to Saudi Arabia's increasing consumption
of energy, as well as a steady decline in the relative importance of oil
in the world economy, it is **unlikely** that the economy will
experience sustained growth in the near term]{.underline}.

[Consequently, hawks within Saudi Arabia's political establishment may
have decided to grow their economy]{.underline} **[not internally but
externally]{.underline}**, [through]{.underline}
**[conquest]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[violent
expansion]{.underline}**. Accordingly, Saudi Arabia has dedicated 13
percent of its gross domestic product to its military for six years and
has become the largest per capita purchaser of weapons in the world.

Countries Facing the Largest Risks from Saudi Military Expansion

[At first glance, despite Saudi Arabia's military buildup over the past
six years, the threat of the Saudis directly attacking one of theirs
neighbors may seem most unlikely]{.underline}. [The U.S. maintains a
substantial naval presence in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, supplemented by
U.S.]{.underline} (and Japanese) [military bases in Bahrain, etc.
Ostensibly, if Saudi Arabia invaded a neighbor, the U.S. military would
insist that the kingdom desist]{.underline}.

**[However]{.underline}**, [if the economic situation in the kingdom
**gets bad enough**]{.underline}, [hawks within the Saudi establishment
may be able to **convince their more moderate
counterparts**]{.underline} [to attack one of the kingdom's neighbors to
**stave off domestic discontent**]{.underline}, [especially if they can
promote the idea across government that the U.S. would be unlikely to
retaliate against the kingdom]{.underline}.

As discussed in "Why the Saudis May be Preparing for War," [it is likely
that the kingdom's economic decline will continue]{.underline}.
**[Especially]{.underline}** [if its]{.underline} **[IPO of
Aramco]{.underline}**, **[Vision 2030 reforms]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[OPEC production cuts]{.underline}** **[fail to live
up to expectations]{.underline}**. [Thus, the probability of Saudi
Arabia attacking a neighbor largely depends on]{.underline} four
[beliefs about the U.S. within the Saudi establishment]{.underline}:

That the American people are too exhausted by 15 years of near-endless
involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan to engage in another war in a
country (Saudi Arabia) filled with adherents to the same form of Islam
that inspired the Islamic State militant group (ISIS).

That the U.S. military is too dispersed around the world and/or involved
with containing Russia to engage in another war in the Middle East,
making it especially unlikely that the U.S. would be willing to
prosecute a successful war against Saudi Arabia since doing so would
likely affect the Muslim holy sites of Mecca and Medina. Should the U.S.
go to war with Saudi Arabia, the entire Muslim world might react
violently in the event U.S. soldiers enter the Hijaz region, which would
significantly bind the U.S. in terms of strategy and is not something
the U.S. military leadership would wish to manage after four years of
historically high tensions with Russia.

That the U.S. political elite lack backbone. For the past several years,
the Saudis have funneled guns and weapons to ISIS and bombed the
near-defenseless country of Yemen with impunity. Therefore, the Saudis
may believe that they can do whatever they want and the U.S. will not
react, especially given Barack Obama's failure to enforce his \"red
line\" in Syria and speeches by Donald Trump indicating an isolationist
worldview that would keep the U.S. out of the Middle East.

That the U.S. is becoming a net energy exporter. [Any event that raises
oil and gas prices is partially in America's interest. If Saudi Arabia
starts a war in the Middle East by invading a neighbor]{.underline}
(Yemen, Qatar, Iraq, etc.), [the biggest loser outside of the region
will be Europe, which will have a significant quantity of its energy
supply cut off]{.underline}.

And, unless Europe wishes to increase its already substantial dependence
on Russian oil and gas, it will have few options but to import more
energy from the U.S. [Thus, it is not entirely within America's interest
to go to war with Saudi Arabia, regardless of the kingdom's
actions]{.underline}.

Even though the European Union is a historic ally of the U.S., it is not
completely within America's interest to protect European energy supplies
coming from the Middle East. Especially since Trump has indicated a
dissatisfaction with, as he has put, Europe not paying its \"part of the
bill\" on its defense.

It is unclear to what extent the Saudi military and political
establishment holds these four beliefs. If the Saudis do not believe the
U.S. will crack down on the kingdom for invading a neighbor, there may
be little that would hold the kingdom back from doing so. The
[political, economic and religious history of the kingdom all **push for
external expansion** through **conquest and war** over internal
expansion through the production of goods and services.]{.underline}

Yemen is the likeliest target for invasion. The country has been
bombarded by Saudi Arabia for two years now, and the Saudi propaganda
machine has been mostly focused on Yemen's Houthi rebels since the
beginning of the Yemeni civil war.

However, invading Yemen is unlikely to provide Saudi Arabia a
significant economic boost, unless Saudi Arabia disrupts the Bab
el-Mandeb Strait, which the U.S. Energy Information Administration
refers to as one of the seven major energy choke points in the world
(3.8 million barrels of oil head to the West pass through the strait
each day, along with the equivalent of 0.5-1 million barrels of natural
gas).

[Should Saudi Arabia succeed in **creating chaos and confusion** in the
strait through rocket attacks, its significantly expanded naval
capabilities or by provoking the Houthis to attack ships in the strait,
Europe will be by far the biggest loser, being deprived of **over \$150
billion worth oil and natural gas per year**, making the Europeans more
dependent on Russia, Norway, the U.S. and Saudi for their energy
needs.]{.underline}

[If the strait is disrupted, oil and gas prices will spike and the Saudi
economy will **profit significantly**]{.underline}, [especially since
the Saudis last year quietly started expanding their East-West
pipeline]{.underline}. Thus, should the strait get cut off, the only
practical method for nearly all of the Gulf states to export energy to
the West will be across Saudi Arabia and/or through its newly expanded
East-West pipeline.

Saudi Arabia often claims it is the Houthis who are threatening the
strait, but the facts suggest otherwise. The Houthis have occupied
multiple locations in the strait over the past two years that would have
allowed them to significantly disrupt shipping, but the strait has
largely remained open, mostly because shutting it down would severely
affect the Houthis' ally, Iran, which ships millions of barrels of oil
and natural gas to Europe through the strait each month.

By comparison, Iranian and Pakistani vessels have been attacked by Saudi
Arabia and/or its allies in Yemen on at least two occasions. Meanwhile,
there is little to no evidence that the majority of attacks on non-Saudi
coalition vessels during the past two years have been carried out by
Houthis.

Beyond Yemen, [Saudi Arabia could target southern and eastern portions
of Iraq]{.underline} (i.e., parts of Al Anbar and Al Muthana), over
which it maintained significant tribal influence before Iraq's
government shifted control to Shiite hands.

In terms of specific locations in Iraq, it is doubtful that Saudi Arabia
would invade Iraq all the way to Iran's border. Doing so would invite a
direct war with Iran and would lead Saudi Arabia to having to absorb an
even greater number of Shiites, which the Saudis would not want.

[Rather, in terms of costs and benefits, it is likelier that Saudi
Arabia could instead attempt to disrupt the Iraq Strategic Pipeline
through a few well-targeted bombs or "terrorist" operations that would
raise the value of Saudi oil at relatively low cost to the
Saudis]{.underline}.

Having a militant organization blow up pumping stations in Al Muthana or
Al Anbar may seem far-fetched, but it would not be the first time such
operations have been used in Iraq effectively. The Mosul-Haifa pipeline
was blown up both by Arab gangs and the Jewish Irgun several times
during the 1930s and the 1940s.

Moreover, hawks in Saudi Arabia have spent the past five years funding
the militant organization Nusra Front, which, despite its claims of
wanting to overthrow the Syrian regime, has spent more time taking over
portions of Al Anbar in Iraq than trying to fight Assad. Meanwhile, guns
funneled to ISIS from Saudi Arabia have led to significant oil supply
disruptions in northern Iraq that, according to Forbes, have
substantially benefited the Saudi regime.

However, in the event that Saudi Arabia did invade Iraq, it would
presumably take over portions of Al Muthana and Al Anbar, which are not
predominantly Shiite, are sparsely populated and would provide Saudi
Arabia two major benefits:

Control over the oil fields in Abu Khaima, Samawa, Salman and Diwan.

Permanent disruption/control of the Iraq Strategic Pipeline.

[Should Saudi Arabia disrupt both the Iraq Strategic Pipeline and the
Bab el-Mandeb Strait, Saudi Arabia will have a **near monopoly** on the
transport of Arabian oil and gas to Europe]{.underline}. Most Arabian
energy producers will be obliged to export energy either across Saudi
Arabia or via far more limited and costly African and Iranian routes.

[Beyond Iraq and Yemen, should the Saudi economic situation get bad
enough, the country **could also attack Qatar**]{.underline}. Qatar
holds three times as much natural gas as Saudi Arabia, and, more
important, the demand for natural gas (which burns cleaner than oil) is
quickly increasing in Europe, where natural gas imports increased by 17
percent in 2015.

While the least likely of the three scenarios, an attack on Qatar is
still a possibility. The growth of natural gas from Qatar and Iran is
the greatest threat to Saudi regional power today. Should Iranian
relations with the West improve, should natural gas continue to displace
oil and should Saudi Arabia's economy continue its decline, then the
Saudis might attack Qatar as a last resort to stop Qatari natural gas
from undermining Saudi oil.

In the short term, deterring Saudi Arabia from using its weapons
stockpiles against a neighbor largely depends on promoting the narrative
that the West (or a coalition of Arab states) will move against the
kingdom should it engage in military aggression. But, in the long term,
[the greatest deterrent to Saudi expansion may **come from within the
kingdom itself**.]{.underline}

### U -- prices low

#### Prices are low and falling

**Paris, 2018**

(Francesa, "Oil Prices Hit A New Low. Here\'s Why That Might Be A Bad
Thing," NPR, 23 Nov. 2018,
<https://www.npr.org/2018/11/23/670440556/oil-prices-hit-a-new-low-heres-why-that-might-be-a-bad-thing>)

**[Oil prices continued to fall]{.underline}** Friday, **[amid weaker
global demand and increased output in the United States, to the lowest
price this year]{.underline}**. **[The cost of a barrel dropped below
\$60, a decrease of more than 20 percent]{.underline}** from its peak
last month. President Trump has credited Saudi Arabia with the falling
oil prices. \"Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\'s go lower!\" he wrote
in a tweet on Tuesday. He called the drop \"a big Tax Cut for America
and the World.\" But the drop in prices has raised concerns about the
international economy, as well as domestic growth in the United States.
While high output in Saudi Arabia has contributed to a decrease in oil
prices, experts cite a combination of factors feeding the decline, on
both the supply and the demand sides. Record oil output in the United
States and exemptions from U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil have pushed up
supply. Meanwhile, waning economic growth, coupled with a strong U.S.
dollar --- which makes oil more expensive for other countries --- could
be contributing to a decrease in demand.

#### Everything is between \$50 and \$60/barrel

crude stockpiles surge," CNBC, 5 June 2019,

**[Oil prices plunged on Wednesday, with futures falling to their lowest
since January]{.underline}**, after the U.S. government reported an
unexpected surge in the nation's crude stockpiles. U.S. commercial crude
inventories jumped by 6.8 million barrels in the week through May 31,
the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported. Stockpiles jumped
despite refineries increasing activity and as U.S. crude imports jumped
by more than 1 million barrels per day. That trumped an earlier reading
from the American Petroleum Institute that suggested stockpiles rose by
3.5 million barrels in the week. Analysts' had expected stocks to drop
by 849,000 barrels, according to a Reuters poll. **[[U.S. West Texas
Intermediate crude](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=@CL.1) fell to a
session low of \$50.66 after the report, the lowest level since Jan.
15.]{.underline}** WTI settled \$1.80 lower at \$51.68 a barrel, falling
3.4% to its weakest closing price in nearly five months. **[[Brent
futures](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=@LCO.1) sank as low as
\$59.45, also its lowest since mid-January]{.underline}**. Brent was
down \$1.31, or 2.1%, at \$60.66 a barrel around 2:25 p.m. ET (1825
GMT). U.S. gasoline inventories also rose by 3.2 million barrels during
the week. Stockpiles of distillates, including diesel and home heating
fuel, jumped by 4.6 million barrels. **[Meanwhile, weekly U.S. oil
production ticked up to an all-time high]{.underline}** 12.4 million
bpd, according to a preliminary reading from EIA. "You had that record
U.S. production again and that surge in imports really just overwhelmed
the report, and it came in the face of refinery runs ticking up," said
John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital.
"Obviously it's more than enough to satisfy demand by a lot and just
makes for a really bearish report across the board." The stockpiles
report compounded pressure on oil prices, which swiftly collapsed over
the last week as the market braced for a prolonged trade battle between
the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump's threat last week to slap
tariffs on Mexican goods, exacerbating fears that global economic growth
will slow and cut demand fuel.

### \$70/Barrel is key

#### Saudi needs \$70-\$80 

**Gamal and Lawler, 2018**

(Rania and Alex, "Saudi Arabia aims to keep crude in \$70 to \$80 band:
sources," Reuters, 4 Sept. 2018,
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-saudi/saudi-arabia-aims-to-keep-crude-in-70-to-80-band-sources-idUSKCN1LL07T>)

**[Saudi Arabia wants oil to stay between \$70 and \$80]{.underline}** a
barrel for now as the world's biggest crude exporter strikes a balance
between maximizing revenue and keeping a lid on prices until U.S.
congressional elections, OPEC and industry sources said. After
announcing the flotation of Saudi Aramco in 2016, **[the kingdom began
pushing for higher crude prices partly to help maximize the valuation of
the state oil company]{.underline}** ahead of an initial public offering
(IPO), originally scheduled for 2018. That changed in April when U.S.
President Donald Trump put public pressure on Riyadh to keep crude
prices in check, wanting to stop U.S. fuel costs rising ahead of the
U.S. midterm elections in November. Now, even though the IPO has been
shelved, **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** still **[wants to keep oil
prices as high as possible]{.underline}** without offending Washington,
the sources said**[. Saudi needs cash to finance a series of economic
development projects]{.underline}**. OPEC and Saudi Arabia do not have
an official price target and are unlikely to adopt one formally. **["The
Saudis need oil at about \$80 and they don't want prices to go below
\$70]{.underline}**. They want to manage the market like this," one of
the sources told Reuters. "**[They need cash. They have plans and
reforms]{.underline}** and now the IPO is delayed. But they don't want
anyone else talking about oil prices now. It's all because of Trump,"
the source said. An informal target of \$70 to \$80 raises the prospect
of Saudi Arabia making regular tweaks to its output to influence the
cost of crude as the market responds to other factors affecting global
supply and demand. One industry source said it may have done precisely
that last week.

#### They need \$70 minimum but more is better 

**Gamal et al, 2019**

(Rania, Alex Lawler, [Dmitry
Zhdannikov](https://www.reuters.com/journalists/dmitry-zhdannikov),
"More shale, who cares? Saudi Arabia pushes for at least \$70 oil,"

**[Budget needs are forcing Saudi Arabia to push for oil prices of at
least \$70 per barrel]{.underline}** this year, industry sources say,
even though U.S. shale oil producers could benefit and Riyadh's share of
global crude markets might be further eroded. **[Riyadh, OPEC's de facto
leader, said it was steeply cutting exports to its main customers in
March and April despite refiners asking for more of its
oil]{.underline}**. The move defies U.S. President Donald Trump's
demands for OPEC to help reduce prices while he toughens sanctions on
oil producers Iran and Venezuela. The **[export cuts are designed to
prop up prices]{.underline}**, sources close to Saudi oil policy say.
Saudi officials say the kingdom's output policies are merely intended to
balance the world market and reduce high inventories. "**[The Saudis
want oil at \$70 at least]{.underline}** and are not worried about too
much shale oil," said one industry source familiar with Saudi oil
policy. Another source said **[Saudi Arabia wanted to "put a floor under
oil prices" at \$70]{.underline}** or slightly lower, and added: "No one
at OPEC can talk about output increases now." Officially, Saudi Arabia,
which plans to raise government spending to boost economic growth, does
not have a price target. It says price levels are determined by the
market and that it is merely targeting a balance of global supply and
demand. **[Even a price of around \$70 a barrel would not balance Saudi
Arabia's books this year]{.underline}**, according to figures cited by
Jihad Azour, director of the International Monetary Fund's Middle East
and Central Asia department in February. **[For that,]{.underline}** he
said, **[Riyadh needs oil prices at \$80-\$85 a barrel. Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**, the world's largest oil exporter, also **[wants
to make sure it avoids a repeat of the 2014-2016 oil price crash below
\$30 per barrel]{.underline}**, sources familiar with Saudi policy said.
