[In the days and months following 11 September 2001, South Asians in the
United States were lumped together and racialized as 'outsiders' and
'threatening'. The lumping of South Asians existed alongside their
differential targeting based on particular religious identities such as
Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh]{.underline}. The religious identity not only
shaped and calibrated the racial hostility against different South Asian
groups but also framed their responses to racial attacks. The primacy of
religious identities in framing the group response to racial hostility
made it difficult to build broader panethnic solidarity, thereby
challenging the existing understanding of the dynamics of panethnic
identity formation and mobilization. [The foregrounding of religious
identity by different South Asian groups was, in fact, in broad
consonance with the multicultural institutional and ideological
framework that provides institutional and discursive avenues for the
deployment of exclusive and immutable identities.]{.underline} The fatal
attack on two elderly Sikhs at Elk Grove, California in March 2011
evoked strong fears among South Asian communities in the United States
(see Lewis 2011). No one has been convicted in this case and the police
have not yet classified these killings as a hate crime, but there were
strong speculations following the incident that the two [Sikhs were
mistaken as Muslims that led to their killing]{.underline}. Similarly,
the killing of six Sikhs by a white supremacist gunman on 5 August 2012
at a Gurdwara (Sikh temple) in Oak Creek, Wisconsin has shaken the Sikh
and other South Asian communities and has brought the trope of mistaken
identity to the fore of public discussion (Mishra 2012). These incidents
symbolized the complex, multifaceted, and differential nature of
racialization of South Asians that will be explored in the course of
this article. While incidents of racial hostility against [South Asians
have a long history, the group has increasingly become the target of
suspicion, racial discrimination, and violent hate crimes in the
aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.1 Based on physical
features and skin colour, they have been lumped together and perceived
as 'strangers', 'outsiders', and 'terrorists'. The blanket targeting of
South Asians in the post-9/11 period was reflected in the following
statement by a forty-five-year-old Hindu Indian immigrant based in Los
Angeles]{.underline}: Well, when they look at us they always think we
are from somewhere else . . . because of our skin colour; maybe they
think that we are all terrorists or something -- I don't know . . . they
try to connect us to those people \[terrorists\] . . . there are things
that scared them.2 A pervasive sense of being the target of suspicion is
symptomatic of the position of South Asians in the United States. [South
Asians straddle between the attributes of model minority and perpetual
outsiders that define their positioning in the racial order. This racial
positioning renders them particularly vulnerable to hostile reactions
such as the ones that followed the September 11th attacks]{.underline}.
The racial reaction after the attacks not only magnified the latent
processes of ongoing racialization of South Asians, but also pointed to
the deeper internal divisions within the community, particularly on the
basis of religion and nation of origin. These divisions were important
lenses through which the South Asian communities perceived and responded
to the incidents of racial targeting in this period. A
sixty-five-year-old New York-based community activist of Indian origin
(Hindu) underlined the importance of these distinctions: There have been
some incidents. . . . [Because they mistake us \[Indians\] . . . as if
we could be terrorists]{.underline}. I think you must have heard about
Kamal Haasan; he was coming from Canada and they were not letting him
enter into America.3 That was because his name sounds like Muslim --
Haasan. So he had problem, though he is an Indian Brahmin \[a Hindu from
high caste\]. This happens . . . even sometime they may mistake us as
Pakistanis.4 [The multiple fissures within the South Asian community on
different identity axes are clearly identified in this
statement.]{.underline}

#### Post-9/11 American policy targeted poor countries in the region, locked and loaded up military training to fire down the "the terrorist"

Analysis Instead of the poor worldwide economic situation encouraging
countries to spend precious resources on other pursuits, the decrease in
arms agreements has led to increased competition between countries and
manufacturers and has contributed to multinational mergers and joint
production ventures. [Experts further believe that the United States is
in no danger of relinquishing its worldwide domination of the arms
market, as countries will continue to rely on the United States to
upgrade existing U.S.-origin systems, train and provide support services
on existing systems, and sell munitions to use in previously purchased
systems]{.underline}. There are also further expectations that former
Warsaw Pact countries as well as specific countries in the Near East,
Asia, and Latin America are the biggest targets for increased weapons
sales in the years to come. [These conditions make the changes to U.S.
export policy even more alarming, as the United States is looking for
new customers to continue its global domination of the arms
market.]{.underline} Military Training [The United States is not just
selling the military hardware, but is also offering military training to
allies in the "war" on terror. Military training is an important foreign
policy tool, used by many countries, in order to transfer political
ideology to foreign governments and military institutions, as well as
establishing common military goals, procedures, and
mechanisms.]{.underline} The utilization of military training to build
military and political relationships is part of an emerging trend that
began at the end of the Cold War. In the last decade, the United States
has trained more than 100,000 foreign police and soldiers annually.[Such
training programs, which take place both within the United States and in
about 150 countries around the world, range from English language
training, counter-narcotics strategies, and preparing forces for
peacekeeping operations. ]{.underline}As with all [things since Sept.
11, however, the focus of today's military training program has shifted
to focus on fighting terrorism]{.underline}. Indeed, the Bush
administration has proposed an increase of 13 percent for International
Military Education and Training (IMET) over this year's budget and a 27
percent increase for Foreign Military Financing (FMF) in addition to
newly planned anti-terrorism programs for foreign militaries. And, in
the \$27.1 billion Emergency FY'02 Supplemental Appropriations Request,
\$100 million is allocated for defense articles, services, and
training. S[ince Sept. 11, the United States has offered military
training to many countries victims of terrorist activities, or
struggling with the presence of terrorist networks. This training, often
disguised as counter-terrorist, is often really counter-insurgency
training]{.underline}, such as in Nepal, Colombia, and the Philippines.
In March 2002, President George W. [Bush emphasized the U.S. reliance on
training programs when he said, "we will not send American troops to
every battle, but America will actively prepare other nations for the
battles ahead]{.underline}." Just as the Bush administration argues that
selling weapons is crucial to developing allies, the same arguments are
applied to military training. [But, while military training may be
beneficial in the war on terrorism, using U.S. military training to curb
terrorism in countries that themselves have negative human right records
or are currently fighting internal wars may not be the most prudent of
strategies. The United States may further complicate internal situations
where government opposition groups are now classified as terrorist
organizations, or where the war on terror is being exploited to serve
national interests. While the United States is strengthening its
military relationships in an effort to widen the coalition against
terrorism, mechanisms to monitor military training are becoming less
transparent.]{.underline} In 1999, Congress passed a legislative
amendment sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-VT, prohibiting the
training of foreign security forces that violate human rights and
requiring DoD to prepare an annual Foreign Military [Training Report
(FMTR) on all military exercises and training involving foreign military
troops, including data from the previous year and estimates for the
current year. However, since its first edition, more and more sections
of the report have become classified, making it increasingly difficult
for the public to obtain information on who is being trained, where they
are being trained, and for what purpose.]{.underline} In addition,
Congress is currently debating further changing or possibly eliminating
reporting requirements on military training. Without public oversight of
U.S. military training programs, the U.S. military is accountable to no
one but itself. Analysis [Terrorist threats are not new in many of the
countries where the United States is currently training military troops.
Part of the emergency supplemental will help provide support and
training for those countries deemed by the United States as under direct
terrorist threats, including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Jordan, Nepal, Oman,
Pakistan, Yemen, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, the Philippines, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Nigeria, Colombia, and Ecuador.]{.underline} While some of these
countries have obvious ties to U.S. efforts to stamp out al Qaeda, with
others[, the United States is gambling with the idea that military
training will buy allies in the long run.]{.underline} Military training
in many instances promotes the readiness, efficiency, and effectiveness
of foreign military troops. However, [it may only worsen the situation
in countries plagued by terror if human rights
conditions ]{.underline}are not implemented and economic and social aid
are not concurrently offered to help strengthen and promote internal
stability. including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Jordan, Nepal, Oman,
Pakistan, Yemen, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, the Philippines, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Nigeria, Colombia, and Ecuador. [While some of these countries have

and promote internal stability. Post-Sept. 11 [Policy Changes Now that
we have a picture of the global arms market, we have a context in which
to judge changes to U.S. export policy.]{.underline} Lifting Sanctions
Immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration proposed
allowing arms sales to countries currently ineligible to receive U.S.
weapons because of sanctions due to human rights violations, lack of
democracy, involvement in acts of aggression, and nuclear testing.
Called the USA Patriot Act, the Bush administration had asked for 5-year
general waivers in mid-September as part of is anti-terrorism bill,
which stated that notwithstanding other provisions ofU.S. law, the
United States can provide security assistance to any country if it would
help fight terrorism or promote international peace and security[.
Legally, U.S. arms sales are determined in accordance with the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). ]{.underline}Being
present on an ITAR list can prohibit a country from receiving U.S.
military equipment or military training. [And, under current U.S. law --
specifically Section 614 of the Foreign Assistance Act -- the Bush
administration has more than enough "wiggle room" for the President to
waive existing regulations governing arms exports and sell weapons to
whatever country he chooses, regardless of their human rights or
democratic practices. And, if a country doesn't have any restrictions
placed upon through U.S. law or due to a UN arms embargo, the United
States is free to export weapons to those countries without violating
any legal provisions]{.underline}. The final version of the bill did not
contain this provision, however, as the Bush administration met with
stiff domestic and international criticism for an across the board
lifting of sanctions. As a result, decisions to lift sanctions were made
on a case-by-case basis, and to date, the number of countries having
their weapons bans lifted is only six. The countries that have had their
sanctions lifted are: Armenia, Azerbaijan, India, Pakistan, Tajikistan,
and Yugoslavia. [While these countries have been identified as key
allies in the global war on terror, each has troubling recent pasts,
which led to them being placed on the list in the first
place. ]{.underline}Not only is each country is involved in inter and
intra-state conflicts, India and Pakistan have been criticized for their
evolving nuclear weapon's programs, Pakistan's military government
attained power as a result of a coup, Azerbaijan has been embroiled in
disputes with Armenia, the stability of Tajikistan remains questionable,
and Yugoslavia remains unstable and a possible "hot spot" for future
conflict. [Arming All "Allies" Even losing the universal lifting of
sanctions, the Bush administration remains undeterred and committed to
arming potential allies in the war against terrorism with U.S. weapons
as quickly as possible.]{.underline} On the 6-month anniversary of the
Sept. 11 attacks, Bush declared that the U.S. was willing to provide
training and assistance to any government facing a terrorist threat:
"America encourages and expects governments everywhere to help remove
the terrorist parasites that threaten their own countries and peace of
the world. If governments need training, or resources to meet this
commitment, America will help" (Federation of American Scientists Arms
Sales Monitoring
Project, [[www.fas.gov/asmp]{.underline}](http://www.fas.gov/asmp)).

#### This form of arms enforcement in the War on Terror marks the brown body for death, arming the American Empire with the right to control the flow of life for the brown body. The War on Terror locks the brown body in a chokehold of necropolitical violence

After the events of 9/11, it was clear that the technologies for the
production of American nationalism were many and diverse. It was
constructed through various representations, not only in the US but also
from other nations and other nationals; [within transnationality, the
discourses of American nationalism that circulate within networks and
channels of cosmopolitanism and of consumer culture were visible as
never before. In the dominant media representations after 9/11, we can
see clearly the articulation of such a nationalism as defined both by
hegemonic state power, the investments of many inside and outside the US
in the idea of 'America' as a liberal state, and the productions and
circulations of a transnational media and consumer
culture. ]{.underline}Although these constructions of America are not
new and have a long history, [their specificities, their reliance on
consumer culture, as well as their racial and gendered history, make
them quite different from other nationalisms. As superpower and
policeman, multicultural nation as well as a site of hierarchical racial
and gendered formations, America, the nation-state, and American
nationalism produce identities within many connectivities in a
transnational world, whether as an imperial power or as a symbol of
freedom and liberty.]{.underline} America is a signifier of many diverse
meanings, but some of these meanings are more hegemonic than others in
particular sites and time periods. [It is both the difficulty and the
necessity of identifying these hegemonic meanings that is my topic here,
as I examine American nationalism in the twenty-first century around the
events of 9/11 as both exceptional from nationalisms in other sites, and
as exemplifying some normative ways in which all nationalisms have come
to be constructed also within transnational connectivities. In
particular, I want to discuss the ways in which America, as nation,
became a site for the articulations of gender and race after
9/11.]{.underline} Although these articulations were not all new, there
were some specific manifestations that revealed the dynamic relation
between nation-state, nationalism, race and gender. [While race and
gender have to be changing in order to work as the regulative
apparatuses of a powerful state, they also are connected to earlier
technologies of race and gender and thus must be understood in relation
to questions of governmentality. We can understand national subjects not
as autonomous projects of resistance but as subjects that emerge in
relation to modern regulative and disciplinary institutions.
F]{.underline}ollowing the work of scholars such as Tim Mitchell and Ann
Stoler, I want to bring together histories of colonialism with questions
about governmentality to not only see how racialised and gendered
subjects emerge in relation to contexts of state power but also to
examine how these subjects are created within realms of social life that
seem to be unrelated to state power (Mitchell, 1988; Stoler, 1995,
2002). [In particular, I want to connect American imperialism with the
articulation in the US of a group including 'Middle Eastern men',
Muslims, and those who 'look Middle Eastern or Muslim' as a racial and
gendered category created by disciplinary power, racialised nationalism
and the geopolitics of the US state. In doing so, I argue that such a
racial formation resonates with US multicul- tural nationalism through
consumer citizenship within a transnational con- sumer and media
culture. Nationalism thus does not emerge out of one imaginary community
but rather is produced through the changing specularity of consumer
culture and contingent community affiliations created by new and
historical hierarchies of race and gender and which extend beyond the
boundaries of the nation-state.]{.underline} The issue of the
relationship between forms of governmentality and the state is a
contentious one. Scholars such as Nikolas Rose (1999) argue that there
is not a clear link between the two since forms of power are never that
linear. Others such as [Achille Mbembe use Agamben's notion of
'necropolitics' to argue that 'necropower', that is the 'maximal economy
now represented by the massacre' characterised the new form of
decentralised state power that pro- duces what he calls 'death
worlds']{.underline} (Mbembe, 2003, pp. 11--40). [If Rose's notion of
governmentality emerges in sites where freedom marks the modern
individual whose practices of making choices constitute modes of
regulation, such an individual can only emerge in dynamic relation to a
site of unfreedom in which the loss of 'choice' and the loss of
'freedom' is always a threat and thus acts as another mode of
regulation. Thus, it cannot be said that the governmentality of freedom
and the decentralised 'death worlds' of 'necropolitics' can be mapped
onto first world and third world/postcolonial sites respectively.
Rather, they work together within a particular context, through the
imaginaries produced by consumer culture's media worlds, the
disciplinary and biopolitical powers of states and of emergent
nationalisms]{.underline}.1 In particular, media technologies of various
kinds, from radio and television to the internet, and their sounds and
images that pervade rural and urban areas, first worlds and third, have
transformed the biopolitics and necropolitics of power. [Furthermore,
the pow- ers of freedom, as Nikolas Rose calls them, that produce modes
of governmentality, are undertaken not simply with the sovereign right
to kill, but also through the right to save. Modes of humanitarianism,
such as human rights regimes, produce unequal subjects as well. To
exclude any consideration of such subjects might lead us to see them
simply as oppositional to the state or even as decentralised forms of
bio- or disciplinary power]{.underline}. Though they might be in
opposition to what Mbembe's calls necropolitics, they may not be in
opposition to all forms of power that produce inequalities between the
Global North and the South. [Rather, it is the interrelation between the
sovereign right to kill and the humanitarian right to rescue that
constitutes modes of modern power, whether by states or by other
institutions of power. Thus even within colonial regimes, missionary
discourses and discourses of rescue, civilising the natives, education,
health and reform proliferated not only to create different cadres and
classes of colonising and colonised subjects. ]{.underline}Elsewhere I
have argued that within British colonialism in the nineteenth century,
the freedom of the English woman became constituted in relation to the
unfreedom of the colonised woman (Grewal, 1996[). The practice of
unveiling the 'veiled woman' or the woman in 'purdah' became a
technology of colonial power exercised both to 'save' and to destroy at
the same time. Furthermore, saving the veiled woman became a project of
reform, undertaken by anti-colonial nationalists as well as by colonial
authorities. Thus one can argue that forms of governmentality produce
nationalisms and the practices of state power and that connection is
especially visible within contexts of imperi- alism. Especially in the
ways in which colonial powers imposed and enabled the emergence of
modern subjects as humanists with the 'white man's burden']{.underline},
as Rudyard Kipling called it, of 'civilising the natives', modernity has
been both hegemonic and biopolitical. While some scholars of
colonialism, for instance, have argued that 'colonial modernity', as
Dipesh Chakrabarty terms it, cannot be seen as seamless with the
modernity of the colonial powers (Chakrabarty, 1993), Ann Stoler has
shown that the biopolitics of self-disciplining of the Dutch in
Indonesia cannot be dissociated from the sexual and racial politics of
colonial rule and the formation of a European self (Stoler, 1995).

#### Thus Rahul and I reject the American Empire and its War on Terror as a reduction of Foreign Military Sales of arms

 

#### Our method is a proliferation of race, using whiteness to "freak itself" can be turned like a gun to the head of white supremacy, utilizing white bodies to undo the naturalized link between whiteness and privilege. Whiteness shouldn't be theorized as a static object, but as a machine; it can be freaked, queered, and used against itself.

"In no real sense did the hippies become Indians or poor blacks, or
prostitutes or tramps--- or only in a guilty disingenuous sense--- but
they found their own significance in what they took these groups to be:
a significance to be understood against the dominant society and with
respect to their own special awareness," says the ethnographer Paul
Willis. 11 Seeing blacks, Mexicans, and Indians as more authentic,
because relatively untouched by mainstream white modernity, the
counterculture transformed white modernity by appropriating some of that
authenticity. But it is that very appropriation that betrays white
privilege and that spawns new tropes of subcultural (and potentially
racist) snobbism. A creative movement turning in on itself, becoming
paranoid and reactionary, is what Guattari called "microfascism."
Psychedelics clearly turned microfascistic in Anjuna, accompanied as it
was by arrogance, segregation, noise pollution, corruption,
exploitation, and psychosis. If whiteness is defined by its lines of
flight, microfascism becomes as interesting to the study of whiteness as
Nazism. Psychedelics--- travel, music, drugs--- is whiteness
accelerating, whiteness stuttering: either a deeper entrenchment into
economic and cultural exploitation, or a shedding of privilege, at least
here and now. On the whole, the Goa freaks of Anjuna do not follow the
lines of flight of whiteness to critique their own position as whites.
In this sense, they were hardly "freaking" the racial assemblage. Recall
the proposition of Rachel Adams and Leslie Fiedler of appropriating
freak as a critical category: \[[F\]reaks cannot be neatly
aligned with any particular identity or ideological position.
Rather, freak is typically used to connote the absence of any known
category of identity\....I am drawn to freak because, like queer, it is
a concept that refuses the logic of identity politics, and
the irreconcilable problems of inclusion and exclusion that
necessarily accompany identitarian categories]{.underline}. 12 [A true
freaking of whiteness would grasp its lines of flight not for
fascism but for a future where paler-skinned bodies have no privileged
access to economic and cultural capital and to happiness. Freaking
whiteness is problem-based, coalition-led,
and self-critical;]{.underline} [it would try to understand what
biophysical and technological forces subtend it (computers, HIV, floods,
radiation). Humanism and cosmopolitanism are severely limited if the
struggle against racism is defined only in human terms. So: race should
not be abandoned or abolished, but proliferated. Race's energies are
then directed at multiplying racial differences, so as to render them
joyfully cacophonic. What is needed is anaffirmation of race's
virtuality. When racial formations crumble and mingle like this, the
dominance of whiteness in the global racial assemblage is undermined as
the faciality machine finds it increasingly difficult to take hold of
bodies. It is not that everyone becomes completely Brownian (or brown!),
completely similar, or completely unique.]{.underline} It is just
that [white supremacism slowly becomes obsolete as other racial
formations start harboring the same creativity as whites do now, linking
all sorts of phenotypes with all sorts of wealth and all sorts of ways
of life (sedentary, touristic, ascetic). When no racial formation is the
standard, race acquires a very different meaning: The
race-tribe exists only at the level of an oppressed race, and in the
name of the oppression it suffers; there is no race
but inferior, minoritarian; there is no dominant race; a race is defined
not by its purity but rather by the impurity conferred upon it by a
system of domination. Bastard and mixed-blood are the true names of
race]{.underline}. 13 [When no racial formation is clearly
hegemonic, perhaps there will be no need anymore for the term
"race." Although there will always be phenotypical
variation and relations of power, perhaps sometime in the future they
won't be correlated at all. Unlikely, but possible.]{.underline} Until
then, however, [there seems little point in trying to stop talking about
race, as antiracists such as Paul Gilroy suggest we
do.]{.underline} 14 [Race is creative, and we can heed its creativities
against itself]{.underline}. Challenging the global faciality machine
encompasses the transformation not just of prejudice, tabloid
journalism, and Unesco, but of the pharmaceutical industry, farm
subsidies, seismology, the arms trade, income tax policy, and the
International Monetary Fund. In contrast to what many antiracists and
advocates of political correctness prescribe, [the sites where the most
urgent battles are to be fought are not culture and language, but trade
and health]{.underline}. [Freaking whiteness is no easy
task]{.underline}. [A good start for social scientists]{.underline},
however, [is to acknowledge the persistent materiality of
race]{.underline}. [It is important that the real barriers to mobility
and imagination that exist in different]{.underline} places be taken
into account. Cosmopolitanism has to be invented, not
imposed. [Taking responsibility and activism will only follow from
both understanding and feeling the intensive differences
that exist between many different kinds of bodies: between a Jew and a
black soldier, between a woman in the Sahel and a woman on Wall Street,
between a Peruvian peasant and a Chinese journalist]{.underline}.

#### Transnational affective politics are a prerequisite to reconsider political strategies, especially in the context of IR and arms sales

Politics after 9/11",

["Terrorism is not a more common event than deaths through cancer or
traffic accidents... But it feels different.]{.underline} That is the
power of discourse." And yet by emphasizing feeling, Croft also
describes the power of affect. While constructivists have pointed to the
role of agents in shaping the meaning of crises or critical junctures
like 9/11, such accounts miss how the ascendancy of particular
discourses may be closely interrelated with their ability to articulate,
channel, and make sense of already existing affective responses.
Moreover, by privileging more incremental forms of socialization,
constructivists also overlook both accelerated forms of affectively
induced normative change---for example, how anger and fear can rapidly
eclipse prior concerns about civil rights---and emergent forms of
identity construction---such as the new constellations of transnational
sympathy engendered by the attacks. [Placed against a backdrop of shared
outrage after 9/11, it is not difficult to comprehend how the "language
of medieval conflict---of finding al Qaeda and putting their 'heads on
sticks'... soon caught on around \[the U.S.\] government, mustering
aggression."154 Discourses may be disembodied; their appeal is not. By
amending existing understandings of actorhood to include human affective
experience, we can begin to proffer a fuller accounting of the myriad
consequences of 9/11. The 9/11 attacks generated a high-intensity
affective wave felt across the public and elite levels, domestically and
internationally. This shockwave rippled through a multitude of social
practices that, in turn, channeled public energy toward familiar symbols
and recognizable forms of grief and outrage. These affective responses
also generated new demands and anxieties, spilled over to other targets,
and created windows of opportunity for strategies of affective
calibration, manipulation, and display. Affective dynamics were
implicated in 9/11 not because terrorism is an exceptional domain of
"irrational" behavior but because it, like other political phenomena,
involves the experiences and concerns of actual human
beings]{.underline}. Whereas IR theories tend to abstract and simplify
actorhood into something disembodied and cognitively-driven, [the
practice of international politics remains inextricable from the
biological, psychological, and social characteristics of human

#### Analyzing race as a fixed justifies racial overdetermination rather than challenging it. Binaristic approaches to identity can only diagnose the status quo as it is rather than escape it.

[My disagreement is not with Fanon's and Martín Alcoff's insistence on
embodiment and emotion, but with their reliance on a Hegelian notion
of recognition to explain encounter]{.underline}. Because of this [they
tend to treat white and nonwhite not only as a dyad, but as
almost naturally opposed entities]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline},

racial formations become dominant]{.underline}, that is, [how racial
formations emerge from material conditions and collective interactions,
which greatly exceed the spatiality of self versus other]{.underline}.
Deleuze and Guattari's concept of faciality is not based on an
intersubjective dialectics enlarged to world-historical scope. In fact,
Deleuze and Guattari strongly distance themselves from phenomenology and
psychoanalysis. First of all, for them, [it isn't consciousness but an
abstract machine of faciality that arranges bodies into relations of
power]{.underline}. And second,[faciality constantly invents new
faces to capture deviant bodies, multiplying possible
positions far beyond any binaries such as black/white (though
binarization can be an important effect)]{.underline}. That is precisely
its strength. There are thousands of encounters, thousands of trains.
Deleuze and Guattari believe [faciality's imperialism arose with
institutional Christianity]{.underline}. Being imposed in lands
populated by different phenotypes, [faciality became a matter
of imperialist racialization]{.underline}. That faciality originated in
Renaissance humanism and depictions of Jesus seems a plausible if
one-sided interpretation. It is less relevant than Deleuze and
Guattari's unusual theory of contemporary racism: [If the face is in
fact Christ]{.underline}, in other words, [your average ordinary White
Man, then the first deviances, the first divergence-types,
are racial: yellow man, black man, men in the second or third
category]{.underline}. They are also inscribed on the \[white\] wall
\[of signification\], distributed by the \[black\] hole \[of
subjectivity\]. [They must be Christianized, in other words,
facialized]{.underline}. [European racism as the white man's claim has
never operated by exclusion, or by the designation of someone as Other:
it is instead in primitive societies that the stranger is grasped as an
"other]{.underline}." [Racism operates by the determination of degrees
of deviance in relation to the White-Man face, which endeavors
to integrate nonconforming traitsinto increasingly
eccentric and backward waves, sometimes tolerating them at given
places under given conditions, in a given ghetto, sometimes erasing them
from the wall, which never abides alterity (it's a Jew, it's an Arab,
it's a Negro, it's a lunatic . . .)]{.underline}. [From the viewpoint of
racism, there is no exterior, there are no people on the outside. There
are only people who should be like us and whose crime it is not to
be]{.underline}. 5 For Anjuna's psy-trance parties, there were "no
people on the outside." Locals, domestic tourists, charter tourists, and
beggars would join the white Goa freaks on the dance floor, sometimes
even in Nine Bar. In fact, as with the United Colors of Benetton, it
will be remembered that the rhetoric of PLUR demonstrated faciality's
inclusiveness--- the parties were supposed to be open to all. But
immediately, the faciality machine would place all bodies in relation to
the Goa freak standard, both spatiotemporally and subjectively,
measuring their acceptability through increasingly meticulous signs:
sociochemical monitoring, scene savviness, chillum circles, sexual
attractiveness. Many nonfreaks felt uneasy being pigeonholed like
this--- especially domestic tourists, who would retreat to the darker
corners. The result was viscosity, bodies temporarily becoming
impenetrable--- more or less. [It would seem to me that to
understand the intricate hierarchies of racism, a framework that allows
for gradual and multidimensional deviances is preferable to a
dialectical model]{.underline}. [Faciality]{.underline} also[explains
why after colonialism, with television and tourism, there is scarcely
place left for any "dark others."]{.underline} [Everyone is included;
everyone is facialized]{.underline}. At the same time, [Euro-American
ways of life continue to spread, and White Man (Elvis Presley, Sylvester
Stallone, David Beckham) remains the global standard against which all
other faces are forced to compete. What this account of racism has in
common with the Fanonian is that whiteness is the norm, even in our
"post"-colonial era]{.underline}. [Where it differs]{.underline},

#### Affective encounters can be taken up to change pedagogy and epistemology starting in this education sphere.

**Youndell and Armstrong 11**, Deborah and Felicity, "A politics beyond
subjects: The affective choreographies and smooth spaces of
schooling", <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X>

In this paper we take up the theme of the 'emotional geographies of
education' as we explore the significance and workings of
space, [subjectivity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/subjectivity) and [affectivity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/affectivity) in
everyday life in schools. We bring together an ensemble of conceptual
tools from Foucault, Butler and Deleuze and Guattari to make sense of
the ways that school spaces and subjects are constituted, to consider
the significance of affectivities in everyday school life, and to show
how these unsettle the subjects and spaces of the education assemblage.
As we do this we offer the notion of affective choreographies for
engaging with emotional geographies in the context of education.
Concerns with the constitution of the subjects of schooling and the
significance of affectivities and spaces are not new to studies in
education. An understanding of the subjectivated subject ([Butler,
1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib4), [Foucault,
1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib13))
has underpinned a great deal of recent work in education concerned to
understand the constraints of identity and the possibilities for
identities to be resisted in [educational
settings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/educational-setting) (See,
for instance, [Davies et al.,
2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib8); [Harwood,

2010a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib31)).
More recently, Deleuze and Guattari's work has begun to be put to work
in education. [The idea of affectivities drawn from Deleuze and Guattari
(2008) has been taken up by education researchers to explore new
possibilities for thinking

the idea of the assemblage ([Deleuze and Guattari,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib11)) has
been drawn on to understand the workings of particular education
disciplines and pedagogic practices as well as the wider field of
education policy and politics (]{.underline}See [Hickey-Moody,

2010a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib31)). [Finally,
conceptualizations of the constituted and constitutive nature of space
developed [in [cultural
geography](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/human-geography)]{.mark} have
been taken up in education to consider the interplay between space and
policy and practices]{.underline} [([Armstrong,

In this paper [we build on this existing body of work, bringing these
threads of analysis together in order to explore the inter-relations of
spaces, subjects and affects in everyday life in
schools]{.underline}through readings of two detailed representations of
events in school life that have troubled us. These events are separated
by more than 30 years -- the first is an autobiographical account of a
confrontation that took place on a canal tow-path during a school trip
in 1976, while the second is an ethnographic account of a tussle over
seats on a sofa that took place in a 'Special School' in 2008. Neither
of these accounts are offered as unmediated reflections of 'real' life,
instead we recognize them as representations and interpretations in
which we are discursively, psychically, and affectively implicated
([Pillow,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib24), [Youdell,
2010b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib32)).
Discussing emotional geographies at a theoretical level allows us to at
least appear to remain somewhat detached -- our stories are saturated
with affectivities and attachments that we cannot remove from their
telling. [Pillow
(2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib24) has
suggested the importance of telling and interrogating discomforting
accounts from our research in education and we take up this challenge
here in order to gain further insight into these incidents that have
troubled us and in which we remain implicated. As we do this we
demonstrate how our collection of conceptual tools can be deployed to
interrogate the workings of space, subjectivity and affect in the
minutiae of the everyday of schooling and to understand the workings of
the educational and social world more widely.... In this paper [we have
sought to demonstrate how thinking
about [subjectivities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/subjectivity), [affectivities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/affectivity) and
spaces together throug]{.underline}h the tools offered by Foucault,
Butler and Deleuze and Guattari can help us to understand [practices of
schooling. This approach allows us to interrogate the ways that subjects
are constituted as well as the ways that these are unsettled both
through the practices of subjectivated subjects and through the flows of
affectivities that exceed these subjects and the striations of space.
Thinking about subjectivities and flows of affectivities together allows
us to demonstrate resignifications as well as the emergence of smooth
spaces that unsettle the education assemblage.]{.underline} As we have
done this, we have drawn on the notion of affective choreographies to
help move our thinking from a focus on the individual subject and body
to a concern with bodies as amalgam and an analysis that foregrounds
collectivities and the event and so is anti-subjectivation. The stories
we told and explored here were 'Canal' and 'Sofa', not 'Ezra' and
'Richard'. Engaging with 'Canal' and 'Sofa' through affective
choreographies has allowed us to demonstrate the tacit collectivity of
these events; the demarcation of what bodies can and cannot do; and the
way that affective intensities exceed these demarcations[. We have shown
how affective choreographies are simultaneously bound by and exceeding
and unsettling discursive framings and the striations of
space]{.underline} -- the bodies in 'Canal' and 'Sofa' act outside their
part in
the [choreography](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/choreography);
take up parts in competing choreographies; and take lines of flight into
smooth spaces. [Deleuze and Guattari
(2008)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175545861100003X#bib11) suggest
that we map the assemblage and find gaps between its rigid lines that
offer lines of flight and the emergence of smooth spaces. In our
readings of 'Canal' and 'Sofa' we have demonstrated how these rigid
lines subjectivate particular sorts of subjects and demarcate what is
doable and what is undoable and we have also shown how affectivities
exceed these subjectivations and take lines of flight that scatter the
education assemblage. This approach, we want to suggest, [enables us to
interrogate the constraints of discourse and the subjectivation at the
same time as we think beyond the subjectivated subject and the
striations of the assemblage, thereby opening up new possibilities for a
politics of becoming.]{.underline}

**Kilberg 14** (Andrew G. I. Kilberg, 8/19/2014, Attended the University
of Virginia Law school and was previously a Law Clerk toe the Supreme
Court, "WE THE PEOPLE: THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY", pg
1061-1063)

[[**WE the People** of the United States]{.underline}]{.mark} . . . do
ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of
America."1 Thus, the Preamble to **[[the United States Constitution
tells us]{.underline}]{.mark}**---upfront, without reservation---that
[[the creators of fundamental law are the People]{.underline}]{.mark}.2
The American system of government rests on a theory of popular
sovereignty. But what does popular sovereignty mean? Who is the
sovereign People?3 The answer at first may seem to be self-evident. The
United States is a nation. [[The People of the United States is the
American people]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the original pledge of
allegiance written by Francis Bellamy says, "I pledge allegiance to my
flag and the republic for which it stands---one nation
indivisible---with liberty and justice for all."4 There are fifty
states, but as Justice Black remarked, it is a simple "fact that the
States of the Union constitute a nation."5 [[If we are one nation, are
we not also one people?]{.underline}]{.mark} The question is not so
open-and-closed, and the ultimate answer is not so simple. Indeed, the
debate over the identity of the People still rages. Often, the
disagreement over the identity of the People is obscured by an emphasis
on the expressions of popular sovereignty, by a focus on the split in
the on-the-ground powers of governing between the federal government and
the state governments. Commentators, thus, often talk about
"sovereignty" when they in fact mean the parameters or boundaries of
governmental power. 6 As Part II will demonstrate however, the concept
of popular sovereignty distinguishes between the exercise of power
through the branches of government and the fundamental, arbitrary power
held by the sovereign people. Nevertheless, other scholars have tackled
the question of whose popular sovereignty head on. We can split
academics into two broad camps: nationalists and state-populists.
Adherents of the former insist that [[the
People]{.underline}]{.mark}---and the only existing people---[[is a
national people]{.underline}]{.mark}. Those in the latter camp maintain
that the several state peoples not only existed before the Constitution,
but also survived ratification. [[Although united in their belief that
the People is a singular national people]{.mark},]{.underline}
nationalists are divided by differing theories of how and when that
singular people came to be. Professor Beer has articulated a strict
nationalist narrative. Simply put, [[the national people as a body
politic existed before the Constitution and it was this people that
created the Constitution.]{.underline}7 [The national people hold
fundamental sovereignty and have "divided the attributes of
sovereignty,]{.underline} ]{.mark}[that is, [the various powers of
governing,]{.mark} between the federal and the state
governments.]{.underline}"8 This division does nothing to shake the fact
that the "American people . . . were unitary."9 Federalism is
functional. Unlike Beer, Professor Amar concedes that America before the
Constitution was composed of "united states, not a unitary state; they
were thirteen Peoples, not (yet) one People."10 It was the several state
peoples who created the Constitution.11 Yet through ratifying the
Constitution, the "separate state Peoples agreed to 'consolidate'
themselves into a single continental People."12 A popular body politic
rarely acts in any practical sense. For Amar, however, ratification was
one of "those rare metalegal moments" where the state peoples
reconstituted themselves as the American People.13 State-populists
contend that the Constitution did not destroy the state peoples as
bodies politic, but these scholars are divided by differing theories of
how the federal government obtained its power. According to one theory,
the Constitution is "a compact among political societies."14 As
Professor McDonald has explained, "national or local governments, being
the creatures of the states, could exercise only those powers explicitly
or implicitly given them by the states; each state government could
exercise all powers unless it was forbidden from doing so by the people
of the state."15 [[The state peoples delegated power to both the state
and federal governments]{.mark};]{.underline} this is a theory of dual
delegation from a single class of sovereigns.

#### Our theory of politics is the only one that opens space for individuals to actually change the world around us

**Claude 88** (Prof. of Gov. and Foreign Affairs, U of VA, States and
the Global System, p. 18)

This view of the state as an institutional monolith is fostered by the
notion of sovereignty, which calls up the image of the monarch,
presiding majestically over his kingdom. [Sovereignty emphasizes the
singularity of the state]{.mark}, its monopoly of authority, [its
unity]{.mark} of command and its capacity [to speak with one
voice.]{.mark} Thus, France wills, Iran demands, China intends, New
Zealand promises and the Soviet Union insists. [One all too easily
conjures up the picture of a single-minded and purposeful state]{.mark}
that decides exactly what it wants to achieve, adopts coherent policies
intelligently adapted to its objectives, knows what it is doing, does
what it intends and always has its act together. This view of the state
is reinforced by political scientists' emphasis upon the concept of
policy and upon the thesis that governments derive policy from
calculations of national interest. [We]{.mark} thus [take it for granted
that states act internationally]{.mark} in accordance with rationality
conceived and consciously constructed schemes of action, and we
implicitly refuse to consider the possibility that alternatives to
policy-directed behavior may have importance -- alternatives such as
random, reactive, instinctual, habitual and conformist behaviour. Our
rationalistic assumption that states do what they have planned to do
tends to inhibit the discovery that states sometimes do what they feel
compelled to do, or what they have the opportunity to do, or what they
have usually done, or what other states are doing, or whatever the line
of least resistance would seem to suggest. [Academic preoccupation with
the making of policy is accompanied by academic neglect of the execution
of policy.]{.mark} We seem to assume that once the state has calculated
its interest and contrived a policy to further that interest, the
carrying out of policy is the virtually automatic result of the routine
functioning of the bureaucratic mechanism of the state. I am inclined to
call [this]{.mark} the [*Genesis* theory of public
administration]{.mark}, taking as my text the passage: 'And God said,
Let there be light; and there was light'. I suspect that in the realm of
government, policy execution [rarely follows so promptly and inexorably
from policy statement.]{.mark} Alternatively, one may dub it the

### Antiblackness

#### Only an approach that emphasized the formed nature of identity through assemblage theory can map a line of escape from facial politics

**Koerner 11** \[Michelle Koerner, professor of women's studies at Duke,
"Lines of Escape: Gilles Deleuze's Encounter with George Jackson,"
Genre, Vol. 44, No. 2 Summer 2011 pg. 161-64\]

In "The Case of Blackness" Moten (2008b: 187) perceptively remarks,
"[What is **inadequate** to blackness is **already given
ontologies**.]{.underline}" What if we were to **[think of blackness as
a name for an ontology of becoming]{.underline}**? How might such a
thinking transform our understanding of the relation of blackness to
history and its specific capacity to "think \[its\] way out of the
exclusionary constructions" of history and the thinking of history
(Moten 2008a: 1744)? [Existing ontologies tend to reduce blackness to a
historical condition, **a "lived experience,"** and in doing so
**effectively eradicate** its **unruly character** as a transformative
force]{.underline}. [Deleuze and Guattari]{.underline}, I think, [offer
a compelling way to **think of this unruliness** when they write, "What
History grasps of the event is its **effectuation in states of affairs
or in lived experience**, but the event in its **becoming**, in its
**specific consistency**, in its self- positing as concept, **escapes
History**]{.underline}" (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 110). To bring this
relation between blackness and becoming further into the open---toward
an affirmation of the unexpected insinuation of blackness signaled by
the use of Jackson's line as an "event in its becoming"---a few more
words need be said about Deleuze's method.

The use of Jackson's writing is just one instance of a procedure that we
find repeated throughout Capitalism and Schizophrenia, where we
constantly encoun- ter unexpected injections of quotations, names, and
ideas lifted from other texts, lines that appear all of sudden as though
propelled by their own force. [One might say they are **deployed**
rather than **explained or interpreted**]{.underline}; as such, [they
**produce textual events** that readers may choose to ignore or **pick
up and run with**]{.underline}. Many names are proposed for this
method---"schizoanalysis, micropolitics, pragmat- ics, diagrammatism,
rhizomatics, cartography" (Deleuze and Parnet \[1977\] 2006: 94)---but
[the crucial issue is to **affirm an experimental practice** that
opposes itself to **the interpretation of texts**, proposing instead
that we think of a book as **"a little machine"** and ask "**what it
functions with**, in connection with what other things does it or does
it not transmit intensities?"]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari
\[1980\] 1987: 4).8 Studying how Soledad Brother functions in Deleuze's
books, connect- ing Jackson's line to questions and historical issues
that are not always explicitly addressed in those books, involves one in
this action. And further, it opens new lines where the intensities
transmitted in Jackson's book make a claim on our own practice.

This method can be seen as an effort to disrupt the hierarchical
opposition between theory and practice and to challenge some of the
major assumptions of Western Marxism. In an interview with Antonio Negri
in the 1990s, [Deleuze]{.underline} (1997: 171) [clarifies]{.underline}
that [he and Guattari have "remained Marxists" in their concern to
analyze the ways capitalism has developed but that their political
philosophy makes three crucial distinctions with respect to more
traditional theoretical approaches]{.underline}: first, [a thinking of
"war machines" as opposed to state theory]{.underline}; second, [a
"consideration of minorities rather than classes]{.underline}"; and
finally, [the study of social "lines of flight" rather than the
interpretation and critique of social contradictions]{.underline}. [Each
of these distinctions]{.underline}, as we will see, **[resonates with
Jackson's political philosophy]{.underline}**, but as the passage from
Anti-Oedipus demonstrates, [the concept of the "line of flight" emerges
directly in connection to Deleuze and Guattari's encounter with Soledad
Brother]{.underline}.

[The concept **affirms** those social constructions that would
**neither** be **determined** by preexisting structures **nor caught**
in a dialectical contradiction]{.underline}. [It names a force that is
**radically autonomous** from existing ontologies, structures, and
historical accounts]{.underline}. It is above all for this reason that
[Deleuze and Guattari insist that society be thought of not as a
"structure" but as a "machine," because such a concept enables the
thinking of the movements, energies, and intensities (i.e., the lines of
flight) that such machines transmit]{.underline}. The thinking of
machines forces us not only to consider the social and historical labor
involved in producing soci- ety but also the ongoing potentials of
constructing new types of assemblages (agencement).

[One of **the key adversaries** of this machinic approach is
**"interpretation"** and more specifically **structuralist
interpretations** of society in terms of contradictions]{.underline}.
According to Deleuze and Guattari (\[1980\] 1987: 293), [structuralism
persisted in the "submission of the line to the point" and as a result
produced a theory of subjectivity]{.underline}, and also an account of
language and the unconscious, [that could not think in terms of movement
and construction]{.underline}. [Defining lines **only in relation** to
**finite points** (**the subject, the signifier**) produces **a
calculable grid**, a structure that then appears as **the hidden
intelligibility of the system and of society generally**]{.underline}.
Louis Althusser's account of the "ideological State apparatus" as the
determining structure of subjectivity is perhaps the extreme expression
of this gridlocked position (an example we will come back to in a later
section). Opposed to this theoretical approach,
[diagrammatism]{.underline} (to invoke one of the terms given for this
method) [maps vectors that generate an open space and the potentials for
giving consistency to the latter.]{.underline}9 In other words, [rather
than tracing the hidden structures of an intolerable system, Deleuze and
Guattari's method aims to **map the ways out of it.**]{.underline}

Ethics here does not predict its moral conclusion by claiming to be good
or bad, rather ethics simply demands an interactive consideration that
predicts nothing about the situation before it is considered. Ethics is
straightforward in its ability to consider and be accountable for action
based on the particularity of any situation. In this way there is as
much potential for a bad ethics as good, but there is no space for a
blanket or legislative ethics which can divine its own future. [The
flesh of the other(s) must be considered to create an ethics of the
other. Faciality adamantly refutes such an ethic by forcing the flesh of
the other into the machine of majoritarian subjectification and
stratification. The other is given a subjectivity that the majoritarian
can identify; the other's body is legislated against by the facial
machine of the dominant. The others subjectivity is then placed, again
legislatively, in the strata, where the strata position, not the flesh
of the other, proscribes the future of this minoritarian. A refusal to
give an other a material body is no ethics at all, because ethics must
insist on the reality, rather than the imaginary or repudiated, flesh of
an other. Such an ethic does not demand assimilation, empathy or
sympathy but merely and at the least a willingness or openness to an
impactful and grave belief in another's flesh as having the right to
exist. Such an ethic considers the body of another without a need to
know it. Moira Gatens' imaginary bodies encompass this idea, where she
calls for Not only a politics of difference -- which seems the obvious
register in which to analyse class, race and sex differences -- but also
for an ethics of difference -- which would be capable of acknowledging
that different forms of embodiment are themselves historical and open to
change.]{.underline}[[8](http://archeologia.women.it/user/quarta/workshops/spectacles2/patriciamaccormack.htm#fn8)
I would add to this that an ethics of difference demands an
acknowledgement that different forms of embodiment are exactly that,
different, not only to our own bodies but to the systems by which
dominant culture understands a body. Acknowledgement here is adamantly
not knowledge. Any acknowledgement of bodies that calls for recognition,
even of difference, is no ethics at all but simply the first step toward
co-option. It risks what Gatens herself claims is wrong with politics as
opposed to ethics, \"in contemporary times body politics more commonly
attempt to incorporate 'others' by assimilation.\"(98) Any demand for
recognition risks assimilation. Deleuze and Guattari's call to becoming,
especially becoming-imperceptible makes such a demand impossible, but,
at the other end of the spectrum their horror of faciality is precisely
due to its forceful assimilation of all bodies to the dominant, in order
that the face may or may not pass.]{.underline} Facialisation is the
politics of assimilation Gatens refuses as an ethic. The face does not
implant or cover over the real body of an other. It does not act like a
Western dominant mask. The face is what brings the body of the other
into existence at all for dominant culture -- without this re-cognitive
tool culture cannot 'see' the other at all. When the other is facialised
s/he is made visible only within the dominant system and in the only
manner the dominant system will allow. Deleuze and Guattari state,
\"When the faciality machine translates formed contents of whatever kind
into a single substance of expression, it already subjugates them to the
exclusive form of signifying and subjective expression.\"(179-80) The
face subjugates the body and the self, to a singular mode of
comprehension and knowledge, and as a singular type of passable or
un-passable subject. These two axes of signifier and subjectifier are
the pistons and cogs of the facial machine. [The signifier is the white
wall or screen of the face and the subjectifier is in the black holes of
the face. Either can foreground and either be in the background however
they are not available individually or separately. They work as a
machine. The white wall of signification is pierced and probed by back
holes of subjectification until an assemblage of a face is evident. This
assemblage entirely repudiates any potential for a body to be unique,
different or even itself. Rather, the body is hijacked into the face,
and the face is hijacked into dominant, what Deleuze and Guattari call
'majoritarian' (\"a state of domination\" 291) culture. No pure
difference or remarkable subjectivity exists, only variants on the
majoritarian white-wall black-hole system. Some variants are
minoritarian, marginalised through a failure in one or another of the
indices available, such as black instead of white or female instead of
male. Such variants decide where the face will be in the strata. Some
faces may be sacrificed. Others are beyond the capacity or scope of the
majoritarian system and are unrecognisable. Deleuze and Guattari state:
\"Faces are not basically individual: they define zones of frequency or
probability, delimit a field that neutralises in advance any expressions
or connections unnameable to the appropriate
significations.\"]{.underline}(168) Hence the individuality of the faces
in the Faces of Australia series are not included for their
individuality. The urge to statistically tally up the amount of 'ethnic'
faces, of 'female' faces is redundant due to the clustering of
majoritarian zones of frequency the faces assemble around. Like a series
of magnets, the white walls and black holes congress into what may
appear an aboriginal or female face but is really an absolutely
predicted and predictable convergence of a possible subject. This is how
we recognise the face. We re-cognise, re-comprehend what we have always
known to be potential in our introduction to new faces. All of the faces
of Australia affirm their likeness to the majoritarian face rather than
their difference. They must have a face, this face, in order to speak
their little narratives about themselves. They must be facialised in
order to enunciate. All of the stamp faces, black, white, child or
adult, male or female, are firstly divergent majoritarian faces. These
are all white male majoritarian faces divided off or made minoritarian
by their singular indices of dividuation from the Christ face. Deleuze
and Guattari point to historical representations of the Christ face as
the prime facial organiser. Christ inhabits the space between God and
Man, but has less of a body than a fully facialised flesh. The face,
penis and wounds of Christ refuse to become flesh but rather remain
signifying white-wall, black-hole machine. The shroud of Turin, the
pierced hands, the pierced brow adding new black-holes of subjectivity
to the gossamer white wall affirm Christ as impossible but absolutely
mandatory. Elaine Scarry writes \"The place of man and the place of God
in the human generation that so dominates Genesis are easy to separate
from one another: the place of man is in the body; the place of God is
in the
voice.\"[9](http://archeologia.women.it/user/quarta/workshops/spectacles2/patriciamaccormack.htm#fn9)
Where Levinas takes God as the demand for ethical treatment of alterity,
Deleuze and Guattari see \"every stratum is a judgement of
God.\"[10](http://archeologia.women.it/user/quarta/workshops/spectacles2/patriciamaccormack.htm#fn10)
Judgement refutes ethics by predicting signification. Whether judgement
is of a body or a war, 'God' for Deleuze and Guattari will identify the
item by its stratum not its specificity. Such judgement not only denies
difference based on its unique value rather than its paradigmatic value,
but also refutes the possibility of change. Like subjectivity, the face
must be singular, however its singular representation occurs through the
usually binary options available to it. Its singularity will then be
stratafiable. Although the options fall most often into two, the access
to their definition and value remains isomorphic -- they always exist in
comparison with the Christ face. [Hence the signification of
black-or-white skin, of female-or-male face, of intellectual-or-retarded
capacity is read in the faces white walls, cemented and affirmed in the
subject's black holes so that the face informs on the subject rather
than the subject belying the face. A face's unity is only available
through binaries, a white gay woman, a black straight man, a sane
healthy male, a sick insane female. Binary choices converge into the
'individual' face. The assemblage of the face reflects the cementations
of strata, which is why it is so akin to landscape. The landscape of the
face is rigid, changeable only in relation to a set of predictable
variances. The landscape is also toiled by a certain set of people, who
own run and map the land. The land is recognised in a certain
way.]{.underline}

Focusing on Wilderson, his **[[absolute prioritization of a political

Black being into the singular position of social death happens, I
contend, at the expense of two significant things that I am hesitant to
bracket for the sake of prioritizing political ontology as the sole
frame of reference for both analyzing anti-Black racism and thinking
resistance within the racialized world. First, it [**[short-circuits an
analysis of power]{.mark} that might reveal** not only **how** the
**practices**, forms, and **apparatuses of anti-Black racism have
historically developed**, changed, and reassembled/reterritorialized in
relation to state power, national identity, philosophical discourse,
biological discourse, political discourse, and so on---changes that,
despite Wilderson's claim that focusing on these things only "mystify"
the question of ontology]{.underline} (Wilderson 2010, 10), surely have
implications for how racial positioning is both thought and resisted in
differing historical and socio-political contexts. To the extent that
Blackness equals a singular ontological position within a macropolitical
structure of antagonism, there is almost no room to bring in the
spectrum and flow of social difference and contingency that no doubt
spans across Black identity as a legitimate issue of analysis and as a
site/sight for the possibility of a range of resisting practices. This
bracketing of difference leads him to make some rather sweeping and
opaquely abstract claims. For example, discussing a main character's
abortion in a prison cell in the 1976 film Bush Mama, Wilderson says,
"Dorothy will abort her baby at the clinic or on the floor of her prison
cell, not because she fights for---and either wins \[End Page 58\] or
loses---the right to do so, but because she is one of 35 million
accumulated and fungible (owned and exchangeable) objects living among
230 million subjects---which is to say, her will is always already
subsumed by the will of civil society" (Wilderson 2010, 128, italics
mine). What I want to press here is how Wilderson's statement, made in
the sole frame of a [**[totalizing political ontology]{.mark}**
overshadowing all other levels of sociality, **[flattens]{.mark}** out
the **[social difference within]{.mark}**, and even the possibility of,
**[a micropolitical social field of 35 million Black people]{.mark}**

optic of anti-Black racism as well as Black sociality to the frame of

### Bataille

#### 

#### Bataille celebrates and glorifies war for war's sake---his ideas are the foundation of fascism.

**Wolin 2006** \[Richard, Distinguished Professor of History at the
[City University of New
York](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_University_of_New_York) Graduate
Center, "Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German Ideology",
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8675.1996.tb00037.x\]

In the worldview of both Bataille and that of German young
conservatives, war plays an essential, positive role. It serves as a
means of dissolving the principium individuationis: the principle of a
bourgeois subjectivity, on which the homogenous order of society - a
world of loneliness and fragmentation -- depends. For, according to
Bataille, "the general movement of life is\... accomplished beyond the
demands of individuals."32 It is in precisely this spirit that he
celebrates the non-utilitarian nature of "combat" or "war" as a type of
aestheticist end in itself: "Glory\...expresses a movement of senseless
frenzy, of measureless expenditure of energy, which the fervor of combat
presupposes. Combat it glorious in that it is always beyond calculation
at some moment."33 For the same reasons, Bataille eulogizes those
premodern "warrier societies in which pure, uncalculated violence and
ostentatious forms of combat held sway."34 For under such conditions,
war was not made subservient to the vulgar ends of enterprise and
accumulation, as is the case for modern-day imperialism, but served as a
glorious end in itself. Yet in the early 1930s, it was precisely this
aestheticist celebration of "violence for violence's sake," or "war for
war's sake," that Benjamin viewed as the essence of modern fascism. As
he remarks in a well known passage: "Fiat ars -- pereat mundus," says
fascism, and, as Marinetti admits, expects war to supply the artistic
gratification of a sense pereption that has been changed by
technology\...Mankind, which in Homer's time was an object of
contemplation for the Olympian gods, now is one for itself. Its
self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own
destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order. This is the
situation of politics which fascism is rendering aesthetic.35 In
Bataille's thought war serves as the harbinger of a cultural
transfiguration in which the primacy of self-subsistent subjectivity
would be replaced by the values of an "unavowable" or "ecstatic
community": that is, a community that would no longer be governed by the
goals of a "visual culture" -- transparency, self-identity, etc. -- but
instead, those of self-laceration, difference, and finitude. In fact
this Bataille-inspired program of an ecstatic community has been quite
explicitly carried forth and explored in the political writings of
Maurice Blanchot (La Communaute inavouable; 1983) and Jean-Luc Nancy (La
Communaute desoeuvree; 1985).

#### 

#### Bataille believes human sacrifice is the ultimate form transgression- this proves his alt is awful.

**Pavlovski 2005** \[Linda, editor for the database Enotes and of
multiple academic collections, "Bataille, Georges: Introduction,"
Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism,
<http://www.enotes.com/twentieth-century-criticism/bataille-georges>\]

Bataille sought "sovereignty" through loss of self, which is achieved
through transgression and excess, notably through laughter, religious
ecstasy, sacrifice, eroticism, death, and poetry. Considering human
sacrifice the ultimate transgression, Bataille was fascinated by
religious feast days that included rites of sacrifice. This fascination
led Bataille to the work of the anthropologist Marcel Mauss and to a
particular interest in the cultures of the Aztecs and North American
Indians. In their use of human sacrifice and potlatch, respectively,
Bataille saw an excessive, generous spirit which he admired. As a direct
result of this, Bataille wrote an unconventional theory of economics
that promoted waste and excess, rather than acquisition. Believing that
transgression existed beyond mere words, Bataille constantly battled
with the problem of writing the inexpressible. He often used a series of
ellipsis points to signify an impasse of expression. In his literary
criticism Bataille praised those authors who used language to express
transgression and emotion; not surprisingly, Bataille especially admired
Marquis de Sade\'s audaciously erotic works. Bataille was also
influenced by G. W. F. Hegel, Karl Marx, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,
and the proponents of surrealism. His work shows a remarkable mixture of
these influences, while advancing his own unique views. Bataille is
probably best known for his erotic novels, particularly Histoire de
l\'oeil (1928; The Story of the Eye), Le bleu du ciel (1945; The Blue of
Noon), and Madame Edwarda (1937; The Naked Beast at Heaven\'s Gate).
These works share a fascinating blend of horror, fantasy, and eroticism.
However, Bataille\'s other works also bear witness to his obsession with
these aspects of life. In La littérature et le mal (1957; Literature and
Evil) Bataille searched for transgression in the works of Charles Pierre
Baudelaire, Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, Emily Brontë, and others.
L\'expérience intérieure (1943; The Inner Experience) and Méthode de
méditation (1947) outline Bataille\'s thoughts on mysticism, his search
for inner silence, and his fascination with images of unbearable pain
coupled with ecstasy. In La part maudite (1949; The Accursed Share),
Bataille related his belief in excess to economics. Many of Bataille\'s
influential essays have appeared in his journal Critique. Bataille\'s
last book, Les larmes d\'Éros (1961; The Tears of Eros) is a study of
the history of eroticism and violence. Containing shocking text and
photographic images, the book was banned in France upon its publication.

#### Bataille's reasoning justifies atrocities and death.

**Boldt-Irons 2000** \[Leslie Anne, Associate Professor of French
at Brock University, "Military discipline and revolutionary exaltation:

Bataille's Le Bleu du Ciel,",
https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-94640665/military-discipline-and-revolutionary-exaltation\]

In 1933, Bataille contributed a review of Andre Malraux\'s novel La
Condition humaine to the ultra left-wing journal La Critique sociale.
(1) In this article, Bataille questions the place that revolution
occupies in the larger and more general context of \"human agitation.\"
He asks, for example, whether the convulsive movements of revolt, social
upheaval, and revolution should be situated outside of, or above, what
is normally experienced as life in its quotidian expressions of
tenderness, enthusiasm or even hate. In the name of what authority, for
example, might one be justified in placing the fascination with
pleasure, torture and possible death outside the limits of acceptable
social practice\--extreme states often linked to revolutionary upheaval
outside the limits of acceptable social practice? Another way of
situating the convulsion of revolutionary movements\--an approach
clearly endorsed by Bataille\--is to place it squarely within the
framework of any activity marked by agitation. From this perspective,
the acts of torture and murder would arise from an excitability or
arousal similar in nature to that intensifying the fury of the
revolutionary impulse. This impulse, writes Bataille, is a means by
which the proletariat\--who had for a long time been deprived of the
possibility of attributing any value to suffering and to life\--is able
to gain access to value itself, a value linked to states of excitation
unsubordinated to any simple political means or end. This value, and the
state of agitation to which it is linked, gives the proletariat both
life and hope, for which even death in all its atrocity might be the
payment required

Hyperreality: Injustice in the Discourse of Deconstruction" - The
Journal of Philosophy, Science & Law Volume 10, June 14, 2010
http://jpsl.org/archives/masters-hyperreality-injustice-discourse-deconstruction/

The effect of Derrida's claim is to overlook the rare but nonetheless
deleterious effects deconstruction can have in political life. In this
essay, I examine the possibility of deconstruction to lead toward
injustice. In 2008 the United States Supreme Court upheld a law designed
to stem the sexual exploitation of children. Known as the Protect Act,
the law prohibits solicitation of child pornography "whether the
material turns out to consist solely of computer-generated images, or
digitally altered photographs of adults, or even if the offer is
fraudulent and the material does not exist at all." \[11\] I argue that
the Protect Act represents an effect of deconstruction, an assault
against the hierarchies of Platonic metaphysics. The distinction in this
hierarchy, between visible objects and images is best embodied in Jean
[**Baudrillard's concept of [simulacra]{.mark}**, a copy of something
that never originally existed]{.underline}. The deconstruction
represented by the Protect Act [[denies substantive difference]{.mark}
between simulacra [and]{.mark} actual examples of child
porn]{.underline}ography. Additionally, [[I argue that this
gesture]{.underline}]{.mark} of deconstruction[[,]{.underline}]{.mark}
precisely [[by displacing]{.mark} the metaphysical [hierarchy between
real and imaginary children]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[endangers the
former]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this case, deconstruction, embodied in
the Protect Act provides a rational incentive to abuse real children. In
at least this exceptional instance, Derrida is wrong: [[deconstruction
can be injustice.]{.underline}]{.mark} Esoteric as it often seems,
deconstruction is not exclusive to the arcane sanctuary of the academy.
It has been popularized or, as Stanley Fish put it, by the beginning of
the 1980's deconstruction "had been appropriated, domesticated and
commodified." \[12\] Derrida alerts us to the importance, indeed, the
inescapability of discourse when he tells us, "There is nothing outside
of the text." \[13\] Coupled with Simon Critchley's assertion that "the
text deconstructs itself", we find an important concept that has
prolific applications. \[14\] Deconstruction, and its various
expressions in practice, is an important artifact of late modernism, and
it becomes crucial, given the ubiquity of the text, that we understand
the sometimes unseen power associated with this apparatus of discourse.
There are important political repercussions to the proliferation of
deconstruction into arenas of power such as law. My analysis does not
proceed by admonishing deconstruction as a uniformly harmful practice.
Catherine Zuckert argues that "Derrida may free his readers from the
spectre of 'totalization,' but by virtue of the same argument, he
deprives them of the capacity to think, much less to act on their own
behalf." \[15\] In effect, Zuckert's argument is that deconstruction
robs us of the necessary grammar to normatively assess political life.
Russell Berman goes even further, suggesting, "deconstruction appears
frighteningly naïve when it occasionally makes political claims, despite
or rather because of its neo-Heideggarian extremism, which thrives on an
unlimited irresponsibility." \[16\] Finally, Mark Lilla accuses Derrida
of secluding deconstruction "in the eternal, messianic beyond where it
cannot be reached by argument, and assumes that his ideologically
sympathetic readers won't ask too many questions." \[17\] Unlike these
accounts, I do not condemn deconstruction as wholly reckless. Yet, I
also differentiate my argument from those analyses that seem to promote
deconstruction as infallibly good. In an article entitled
"Deconstruction is Justice", Elisabeth Weber writes that, "questions of
answering to the other's call" would have been "unthinkable without the
immense contribution of Jacques Derrida's writings." \[18\] John
McCormick, suggesting that Derrida had put himself in the position of
Socrates on trial, concurs, "that the ceaseless questioning of force
must be part of any agenda that aspires to justice." \[19\] In
McCormick's formulation on the questioning of force in the form of
deconstruction is itself predicated on force, on the premise that it
"must be." Similarly, William Sokoloff, while careful to recognize the
subtle paradoxes that emerge from deconstruction, argues that exposing
the ungrounded violence of institutions, "opens them to the possibility
of new articulations grounded on less arbitrary modes of authority.
Authority is less arbitrary when it supports its own radical critique
and affirms the contingent character of its foundation." \[20\] That
assertion, interestingly enough, attempts to prop itself up as
self-evident and conceal its own arbitrary foundations. A critical and
reflexive authority might be equally violent, if not more so, than one
whose foundations have the appearance of stability. In other words,
Sokoloff does not consider the possibility that institutions whose false
foundations are laid bare are revealed as having no legitimate claim to
authority. All that remains for such neurotic regimes might be the most
vulgar expressions of violence. At times, critics and supporters have
tended toward exaggeration in either condemning deconstruction as
unqualified evil, or praising it as the riddle of history solved. My
intervention in this debate proceeds from the premise that there may be
circumstances in which some Platonic metaphysical categories ought to be
preserved. Platonic hierarchies are heavily predicated on reason and the
use of rationality in order to promote or preserve justice. For
instance, in The Laws, the Athenian Stranger counsels that if the
hierarchy in which judges are considered superior to the masses should
collapse, the wrong kind of teaching will be promoted. Playwrights will
have a disincentive to author edifying works, catering instead to the
vulgar tastes of the masses. \[21\] At the core of Platonic metaphysics
is an understanding that the preservation, or dissolution, of
hierarchies influences rational decision-making. Rather than become
relegated as something to be refuted or overcome, I submit that its
concern for justice ought to bring Platonism into dialogue with
deconstruction. \[22\] My aim is to offer an account of deconstruction
that recognizes its potential for different kinds of normative
consequences. Deconstruction can bejustice, as it can be injustice. It
follows that it can be a political chance for historical progress,
provided such a thing is possible. In the following section I will
describe the aim of deconstruction and what it attempts to accomplish.
Subsequently, I will provide relevant details of the Protect Act 2003
and, using Jean Baudrillard's theories, I will elaborate the several
categories of simulation the law addresses. In the fourth section, I
will argue that the Protect Act represents an example of deconstruction
and more fully describe its potential for injustice. My argument is that
by undermining the Platonic metaphysical hierarchy privileging real
objects over imaginary objects, the deconstructive operation
accomplished by the Protect Act defeats itself, and provides a rational
incentive for sexual predators to harm actual children. II. A
Performative Account of Deconstruction The term deconstruction is often
synonymous with Jacques Derrida. This is understandable, given that
Derrida essentially authored the term, but also somewhat paradoxical,
since the author is generally refused imperial jurisdiction over his or
her writings in postmodern thought. Although deconstruction is
inseparable from Derrida's name, it would be a curious error to give him
absolute authority over its meaning. My confrontation with
deconstruction proceeds from the premise that deconstruction is a
discursive object. As Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe tell us: The
fact that every object is constituted as an object of discourse has
nothing to do with whether there is a world external to thought, or with
the realism/idealism opposition. An earthquake or the falling of a brick
is an event that certainly exists, in the sense that it occurs here and
now, independently of my will. But whether their specificity as object
is constructed in terms of 'natural phenomena' or 'expressions of the
wrath of God', depends upon the structuring of a discursive field. What
is denied is not that such objects exist externally to thought, but the
rather different assertion that they could constitute themselves as
objects outside any discursive condition of emergence. \[23\] The same
must apply for deconstruction. We do not have extra-discursive access to
the truth of deconstruction found at some Archimedean point. There is
deconstruction, which may be a certain set of operations that occur
within a text, and then there is the discourse of deconstruction, the
text in which our references to deconstruction are situated. We never
access the essential truth of deconstruction. Instead, discourse always
arises to mediate between us and the noumenal world. For these reasons
-- because Derrida is not the exclusive author of the field of
deconstruction; because prior to any ultimate reality of deconstruction
there is the discourse of deconstruction; and because the aim of this
essay is to address the effects of deconstruction -- the aim here is to
consider the ways in which deconstruction performs. For the purposes of
this essay, I will avoid the futility of addressing what deconstruction
is, focusing instead on what deconstruction does. I have chosen this
approach for two reasons. Firstly, attempting to delineate what
deconstruction is tends to have the trappings of applying an essence,
and that, it seems, is precisely what deconstruction attempts to defy.
Secondly, in order to attend to the political consequences, I would like
to avoid wrangling over the multiform interpretations of Derridean
prose, and will focus instead on what deconstruction has the potential
to do. "There is no being behind doing," Nietzsche tells us. \[24\] "The
deed," he says, "is everything." \[25\] With that in mind, I understand
deconstruction to be an array of activities aimed at undermining the
hierarchies embedded within traditional Western metaphysics. These
hierarchies are not naturally occurring formulations. Rather, they are
produced in the course of philosophy and this production is concomitant
with the attempt to conceal the artificiality of their origins. As
Rodolphe Gasche explains, "Deconstruction thus begins by taking up
broached but discontinued implications -- discontinued because they
would have contradicted the intentions of philosophy."\[26\]
Deconstruction exposes the artificial origins of metaphysical
hierarchies, but not simply to leave them in place. Derrida argues that
these hierarchies, represent a form of hostile subjection. As he
explains: To do justice to this necessity is to recognize that in a
classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful
coexistence of a vis-à-vis, but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of
the two terms governs the other (axiologically, logically, etc.), or has
the upper hand. To deconstruct the opposition, first of all, is to
overturn the hierarchy at a given moment. \[27\] For example, Derrida
assails the Platonic opposition between writing and speech, a hierarchy
in which speech is clearly favored by Plato. In Pheaedrus, Plato
describes the written word as an orphan that "trundles about" aimlessly,
which "always needs its father to help it." \[28\] As Jonathan Culler
notes, speech, in contrast with writing, is seen in Platonic philosophy
as corresponding with the presence of the speaker and his or her
thought, and supposedly maintains a greater hold on reality. \[29\]
Writing, by contradistinction, suffers from the absence of a speaker and
the loss of proximity to the speaker's thought. How does deconstruction
attempt to accomplish this aim of undermining metaphysical hierarchies?
There is no one approach to deconstruction, which is, instead, multiple
strategies. Because they rely on the texts and discourses that are being
deconstructed, it is probably fair to say that no two deconstructions
are identical. However, the strategy most pertinent to this study
centers on what Derrida referred to as "supplementarity." As Derrida
explains, "the supplement is exterior, outside of the positivity to
which it is super-added, alien to that which, in order to be replaced by
it, must be other than it." \[30\] The supplement is an "inessential
extra," portrayed as foreign, as in the case of evil to good. \[31\]
Evil is traditionally represented as superfluous, and existing outside
of what is natural and good. But Derrida's point is that these
supplements are crucial. Hardly inessential extras, supplements such as
writing, or evil, or absence, are shown by deconstruction to be vital to
their corresponding positive values -- speech, good, and presence. Evil,
for example, is not a super-added foreign entity; rather, it is vital to
delineating the concept of good. Writing is not a poor substitute for
speech; it is a necessary condition of speech. In effect, through
re-reading the text, the deconstructionist is able to show that the
subjugated term is necessary to the dominant term, rather than an
extraneous supplement. The favored term depends on the supplement. The
aim of deconstruction, then, is to expose and undermine, or "overturn",
metaphysical hierarchies because one term is always subjugated by the
other. With this ethos in mind, Platonic metaphysics, replete with the
signs of hierarchy, present an inviting target for the
deconstructionist. Plato's metaphysics are rich and complicated. Any
attempt to comprehensively encapsulate them here would fail. There is,
however, a critical element germane to the discourse of deconstruction.
In Plato's thought there are clearly higher and lower forms of reality,
and, accordingly, he offers a theory of reality that privileges ideas
over the material world and its corruptions. Reality is divided between
the vulgar world of appearances, and the ethereality of the intelligible
world. Ideas occupy the higher strata of the hierarchy, where they
maintain "a greater certainty and truth" than the crudeness of the
visible world. \[32\] Situated at the penultimate stratum of reality are
the Forms, which are "uncreated and indestructible", the intelligible
essence of "'things-in-themselves.'" \[33\] Beneath the Forms are their
imperfect copies, or, as Plato says, "that which bears the same name as
the form and resembles it but is sensible."\[34\] By contradistinction
to the Forms, these copies, or visible objects, are both created and
destructible. \[35\] They are the tangible objects ascertainable to
sensory perception. At the nadir of reality, beneath even the crude
visible objects, are images. These are reflections, phantasms, or the
mere "likenesses" of actual things. \[36\] A relevant and subtle
distinction has to be made here. Visible objects include "the living
creatures about us and all the works of nature and human hands." \[37\]
Corporeal creatures, including human beings, are visible objects.
Artifacts, such as drawings and sculptures, are also visible objects.
Images, on the other hand, are the reflections of visible objects.
Therefore, while the painting of an artist, the material production
generated by human hands is within the realm of visible objects, the
image the painting portrays is just that, an image. As Plato describes
it, "Then what we call a likeness genuinely is in not genuinely being."
\[38\] A painting of a human being is a visible object -- the canvas and
paints reflect the effort of human hands. The image of the human being
within the paint is a mere reflection of a more real, human person. But
Plato goes further in variegating truth, even within the category of
images. In the dialogue between Theaetetus and the Eleatic Stranger, it
is said that those images that genuinely reflect visible objects, such
as "images in water and in mirrors" bear greater truth than fictitious
representations. \[39\] A sculpture or painting of an actual event or
person is superior to a work of art conceived purely in the imagination.
Only the reviled sophists deny this and restrict their focus to "only
about what comes from words." \[40\] It is against this metaphysical
hierarchy that deconstruction intervenes. For Derrida in particular,
Western metaphysics has privileged the concept of presence over absence
despite the necessity of difference in order for language, spoken or
otherwise, to function. Absence, or spacing, is crucial and yet denied
its fundamental importance by philosophy. Platonic philosophy, with its
veneration of Forms, most keenly defined this privileging of presence,
in Derrida's thought. He explains: All the concepts by which eidos or
morphe could be translated and determined refer back to the theme of
presence in general. Form is presence itself. Formality is what is
presented, visible, and conceivable of the thing in general. \[41\]
Platonic metaphysics represents a hierarchy that assigns greater truth,
and therefore reality to the higher strata. Plato considered the Forms
to be more real, and thus more present than the other levels of reality.
But even at the lower levels of reality, visible objects maintain a
greater reality than the phantasms of imagination. It is against this
kind of metaphysical hierarchy, and its privileging of presence, that
deconstruction works to expose and undermine. As I will demonstrate, the
supremacy of visible objects over images is precisely what is called
into question by a recent example of legal deconstruction. III. The
Fugitive Apparition In 2004, prosecution began for Michael Williams, a
Florida man who had been arrested and charged with pandering child
pornography over the Internet. Authorities claimed that Williams offered
to distribute obscene images of children in a chat room exchange.
Perhaps the most disturbing detail of the case is that the images the
defendant expressed willingness to distribute were purportedly of his
own four-year old daughter. \[42\] Williams was convicted and sentenced
to five years in prison under a new law, the Prosecutorial Remedies and
Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today, also known as the
Protect Act 2003. After a protracted legal battle, the Supreme Court, in
United States v. Williams, upheld the validity of the law used in the
conviction of Williams. There was, however, a complication to the case
of United States v. Williams. The images of his daughter did not exist.
They never did exist. There simply were no such images. Williams was
arrested, prosecuted, and convicted for pandering a simulation. He
pretended to possess what he did not, in fact, possess. While the
Protect Act covers a wide range of activities pertaining to the sexual
exploitation of children, one particular provision was instrumental in
the case. Section 504 of the Protect Act declares that child pornography
includes: A visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon,
sculpture, or painting, that -- depicts a minor engaging in sexually
explicit conduct; and is obscene; or depicts an image that is, or
appears to be, of a minor engaging in graphic bestiality, sadistic or
masochistic abuse, or sexual intercourse, including genital-genital,
oral-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or
opposite sex. \[43\] Furthermore, in Section 503, the definition of
child pornography is expanded to include "computer generated" images or
pictures "where such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor
engaging in sexually explicit conduct." \[44\] Finally, an additional
category of objects are rendered illegal in Section 503, which states,
"any material or purported material in a manner that reflects belief, or
that is intended to cause another to believe, that material or purported
material is" child pornography. \[45\] Child pornography, which might
generally be understood as images reflecting obscenity involving actual
children, has long been illegal. The recently instituted Protect Act
extends the law to include various simulations of child pornography.
Cartoons, computer generated images, and -- under the provisions of
Section 503 -- the belief in non-existent images of child pornography
are all provided the same illegal status as depictions of actual
children in pornographic acts. Furthermore, the Protect Act amends
sentencing guidelines found in Title 18, United States Code so that
actual and simulated child pornography are both punishable by the same
sentencing guidelines. \[46\] The penalties for both actual and
simulated child pornography are effectively identical. The distinction
between these simulations and what I will classify as actual child
pornography is best embodied in how [[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}
describes simulations of the late-modern epoch. He [[declares:
Simulation is no longer]{.underline}]{.mark} that of a territory, [[a
referential being,]{.underline}]{.mark} or a substance[[. It
is]{.underline}]{.mark} the generation by models of a real without
origin or reality: [[a hyperreality.]{.underline}]{.mark} The territory
no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless
the map that precedes the territory -- precession of simulacra -- that
engenders the territory, and if one must return to the fable, today it
is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of the map.
\[47\] Put differently, a simulacrum is a copy of a thing that never
existed in the first place. As Baudrillard says, "To simulate is to
feign to have what one doesn't have." \[48\] For Baudrillard, signs had
been constructed in the Medieval world "to imitate nature" and then, at
the onset of industrialism, to engage in the mass production of "exact
replicas, infinitely produced and reproduced by assembly-line processes
and eventually automation." \[49\] In late-modernism, the third
"precession" of simulacra as Baudrillard refers to it, the mass
production remains, but most of the original objects copied in the
industrial revolution have long vanished. In the third precession,
Baudrillard says, "We are in simulation in the modern sense of the word,
of which industrialization is but the final manifestation." \[50\] The
simulations prohibited by the Protect Act belong to this order of
simulation; they are copies of things that never existed in the first
place. A painting, cartoon, sculpture, or computer generated image of
obscenities involving children are qualitatively different than a
photograph or video of an actual child involved in sexual activity. A
simulation, as the copy of a thing that never existed in the first
place, is not a recording of an actual child. The first of the
simulations defined by the Protect Act, the use of computer generated
images, is what is called 'morphing.' This practice involves, for
example, taking the nude image of an adult and grafting onto it the
visage of a minor. Presumably, the original image of the minor was not
sexually explicit, and only assumes the character of pornography after
it has been grafted. An argument that morphing involves sexualizing of
an actual child is tenuous. Morphing takes two preexisting images to
create an entirely new image. The actual minor was never involved, and
only the entirely new image of the minor is sexualized. Admittedly, it
could be argued that if someone ever discovered that they had been the
object of 'morphing' they might be embarrassed, humiliated, and perhaps
even traumatized. Yet a person could also be the object of morphing and
never actually discover it. This is qualitatively different than the
sort of injury that transpires in the production of actual child
pornography, in which it is virtually impossible to be abused and not
realize it. The second simulation, cartoon drawings or animations, might
never involve an actual human being beyond the imagination of the
cartoonist or animator. In a case where the cartoonist proceeds purely
from inspiration, no actual child is endangered, and instead, the
reasoning behind this provision of the Protect Act seems to be that the
more diffuse category of 'children' is what is being potentially
endangered. The last of these simulations might be described best as
non-existent images, or, put differently, 'nothing'. It is important to
remember that the defendant in United States v. Williams did not
actually have the material he offered to others on the Internet; he
could not because they did not exist. His conviction was based on a
simulation; the false claim that he did possess them and was intent on
distributing them was illegal. The law effectively makes it illegal to
pander the distribution of the non-existent, the most imaginary of
simulacrum. Despite siding with the majority opinion in upholding the
Protect Act, Chief Justice John Roberts voiced his concern over the
provision against simulations, asking, "Let's say a movie reviewer
describes the film as just awful and containing child pornography? Under
the terms of the law, couldn't the reviewer be prosecuted?" \[51\] In
effect, the law makes it illegal to solicit or pander nothing so long as
the nothing that was solicited or pandered was represented as child
pornography. The common denominator between these newly prohibited
materials is that they do not contain authentic minors. Insofar as they
can be said to be examples of child pornography, they are
representations of representations. IV. The Rational Crisis of Simulacra
In Platonic metaphysics, and perhaps even **[in
Baudrillard's]{.underline}** postmodern [**thought**,]{.underline}
[**there is a conspicuous grief over**]{.underline} prospects for the
**[loss of originality]{.underline}**. []{.mark}Baudrillard laments, "It
is all of metaphysics that is lost. No more mirror of being and its
appearances, of the real and its concept."\[52\] Simulations and
simulacra belong to a lower order of reality than visible things.
Simulacra are less authentic than the things they purport to copy,
meaning that simulacra are less real than original objects. Hence, the
cartoon drawing of a fictional child depicted in an obscene manner is
less real than a photograph of an actual child. The drawing represents a
likeness of a visible thing that may have never existed, while the
photograph more directly represents a visible thing. The Protect Act
upsets this representation of reality, and is a consequence of
deconstructive operations within the apparatus of law. As part of his
attack on Western metaphysics, Derrida contended that the Forms were the
zenith of presence in Platonic thought. By contrast, images are the
nadir of presence, and are characterized instead by absence. Indeed,
Derrida is correct in his assessment concerning this aspect of Platonic
thought. In Timaeus, Plato writes that, "space, which is eternal and
indestructible, which provides a position for everything that comes to
be, and which is apprehended without the senses by a sort of spurious
reasoning and so hard to believe in." \[53\] Space, or that which is
absent, and images, which are the least present kinds of reality occupy
the lowest strata. They correspond to the least sophisticated knowledge,
and they require the least amount of reason for comprehension. In fact,
images are nothing more than illusion, the shadows projected onto the
wall of Plato's Allegory of the Cave. The shadows and likenesses
appearing on the cave wall are referred to as "meaningless illusions"
while the originals projecting the shadows are described as "more real
objects." \[54\] While they are not the most real, the objects which are
the source of the shadows possess more reality than the meaningless
images on the wall. Derrida is not wrong; Plato clearly privileges the
Form over the image, and the present over the absent. Deconstruction
attempts to dismantle this hierarchy and "brings low what was high."
\[55\] This is the effect of the Protect Act; it is the visible symptom
of deconstruction. The hierarchy between visible things and inferior
likenesses are undermined because both categories are made illegal in
reference to obscenity depicting children. Simulation is given equal
status to visible things. That which was lower, a cartoon, a
computer-generated image, or nothing at all, is suddenly just as illegal
as a photograph or video of an actual child. The effect of this
deconstruction is made most clear with reference to the pandering of
nothing. If an offender attempts to procure what he or she wrongly
believes is child pornography, then this is just as illegal as actually
having it. In effect, simulating, or feigning the possession of
something when one really has nothing, is as illegal as having
something. Presence and absence are given the same status. Of course a
photograph or video is also, as Walter Benjamin might teach us, a
mechanical reproduction. \[56\] A photograph is not the immediacy of the
real thing. Indeed, it should be acknowledged that photograph portraying
the actual event of child abuse is equivalent to a cartoon sketching of
actual child abuse. Both are connected to an actual reprehensible event.
But this is not the extent of what the Protect Act covers. Instead, the
Protect Act equates the photographic depiction of actual child abuse
with a cartoon drawing of an event that never happened, a
computer-generated image of a person that never existed, or a false
claim concerning the possession of an image. Furthermore, it directly
attacks the hierarchical distinction Plato draws between those superior
images that genuinely reflect reality, such as mirrors and water, and
inferior, purely fictive images. The privilege previously afforded to
the status of depicting real children is revoked. \[57\] That which was
previously high, has been brought lower, or at least to the same level
as simulacra. Law, Derrida explains, "is the element of calculation."
\[58\] Accordingly, the confrontation with law, in those cases when the
law is actually given consideration, is predicated on the logic of
consequences. Laws such as the Protect Act proceed from the assumption
that there is a link between the consumption of actual child pornography
and the proliferation of simulations. If deconstruction undermines the
greater metaphysical seriousness of actual child pornography over
simulations, what are the possible consequences? My response is that
real children are potentially endangered because the rational
disincentive to produce and distribute actual child pornography is
negated when simulations are just as illegal as the genuine article. The
deconstructive operation at work in the Protect Act leaves no
discernible legal differentiation between simulated and actual child
pornography. The hierarchy that once distinguished between them is
dismantled. Now, they are brought to an equivalent status. Both are
illegal. Given that simulations such as cartoons, computer generated
images, and 'nothing' are now illegal, an offender no longer has a legal
option, outside of total suppression, for his or her erotic pursuits.
Considering the inefficacy of harsh punishments in eliminating incidents
of child exploitation and abuse, the success of total suppression as a
strategy, which seems to be the aim of the Protect Act, is highly
improbable. Of course my argument presumes that the erotic focus of an
offender is diffuse. It presumes that an offender is not specifically
interested in cartoon depictions of child pornography. In the case of
that kind of subject, my argument is not applicable. But in a case where
an offender might have chosen simulations over actual child pornography
because the first category was formerly legal, the Protect Act creates a
disincentive to choose the simulation. If both categories are merged
into one by virtue of criminalization, and the offender is faced with
the possibility of prison for both, then the risk may as well be taken
in the interest for the more authentic article, actual child
pornography. \[59\] Presuming the category of simulations had been
legally safe to a pedophile before the Protect Act, in the wake of the
law, that category is now just as illegal as actual child pornography.
While actual duration of incarceration may vary, the result, in the case
of actual child pornography and simulations still results in
imprisonment, which is often a precarious and dangerous environment for
sex offenders. The deconstruction that occurs at the site of the law
does not necessarily correspond to deconstruction in the erotic drives
of a pedophile. Just because the law elevates simulations to the same
status of actual child pornography, does not mean that the offender has
performed a similar discursive operation. Instead, given the formidable
penalties now involved with both actual and simulated child pornography,
the market for simulations may decrease and the market for actual child
pornography could conceivably increase. Presuming that some percentage
of the population suppressed the desire for actual child pornography,
simulations, for this group, became a legal outlet. Without that legal
outlet, the incentive to suppress the desire for actual child
pornography is threatened. This presumption is hardly foreign to the
logic of the Protect Act. It explicitly complains that the production of
simulations has been a strategy adopted by traffickers and consumers of
child pornography to avoid prosecution. \[60\] The government response
is understandable, but dangerous. Posing the same punitive risk for
soliciting actual child pornography or simulations, the Protect Act
reduces the legal disincentive to exploit real children. This instance
of deconstruction potentially endangers real children at the expense of
safeguarding simulations. The question that ought to confront us is
exactly what justice is brought about by the deconstructive operation
represented by the Protect Act. Real children are exploited by actual
child pornography. The primary object exploited by cartoons, computer
generated images, and empty promises of pandering, is the rather
abstract category of childhood or children. The displacement of
traditional metaphysics found in Section 504 of the Protect Act only
seems to protect a formal idea of children rather than any real child.
Despite Derrida's efforts against the presence of Form, and the
corresponding valorization of reason it earns in Platonic thought, this
event of deconstruction provides a rational incentive for a pedophile to
endanger real children. In this case, deconstruction hardly seems like
justice. V. Concluding Remarks: The Labors of Injustice Derrida was
right to point out the deconstructibility of law. Yet law, inasmuch as
it can represent a rereading of metaphysical text, can also be an
expression of deconstruction. This does not mean that the law is
undeconstructible, but it does mean that something undeconstructible has
expressed itself through the law that redresses metaphysical hierarchy.
In terms of the Protect Act, the law is not a consequence of justice.
Rather it is the consequence of injustice. It follows that if
deconstruction can also be injustice, then injustice must also be
undeconstructible. This premise should seem familiar. In The Republic of
Plato, Thrasymachus violently asserts that "'just' or 'right' means
nothing but what is to the interest of the stronger party." \[61\]
Socrates responds by pointing out that sometimes the stronger mistake
what is in their own best interest. The stronger compel the weaker to
carry out orders that do not serve the interest of the strong. In
effect, the strong inflict injustice upon themselves. [[It would be a
mistake to presume]{.mark} that every [deconstruction is an event of
justice.]{.mark}]{.underline} It presumes that injustice is the
dangerous supplement, alien and external to justice that could be
eradicated with the purity of deconstruction. Furthermore, it portrays
the possibility of control over written language that neither Plato nor
Derrida would endorse. **[The [deconstruction]{.mark}]{.underline}**ist
is not a master **[[of hyperreality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Just as
Thrasymachus' stronger party [[**errs in its effort to obliterate
injustice,** and **actually** **succeeds in creating it**]{.mark}
inadvertently]{.underline}, deconstruction, insofar as it is a part of
interhuman discourse, is prone to misunderstanding, miscommunication,
and the numerous other species of human fallibility. A dialectical
reading suggests that what justice is compelled to acknowledge is
injustice, and not necessarily law. Justice can only emerge as a viable
concept by attending to its negation. [[Justice and law can be in
opposition, **but this conflict is not necessary**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Instead, it is justice and injustice that are necessarily in conflict.
Derrida is right in saying that "law is not justice" but stops short in
identifying the important corollary that law is not injustice. \[62\]
[[It becomes unclear]{.mark} as to [why law as a category
ought]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[be the object of unyielding
deconstruction]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is to say, it is not clear why
"violence without ground" deserves to be equated with injustice. [[A
**law prohibiting rape**]{.underline}]{.mark} may be violence without
ground, it [**[may be a]{.underline}**]{.mark} sedimented
**[[sign]{.underline}]{.mark}** of authority[, [but it hardly seems to
deserve to be deconstructed]{.underline}]{.mark}

**Kellner 89** \[Phil. Chair @ UCLA, 1989, "Jean Baudrillard",
<https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/Baudrillard.pdf> \]

Yet does the sort of symbolic exchange which Baudrillard advocates
really provide a solution to the question of death? Baudrillard's notion
of [[symbolic exchange]{.mark} between life and death and his ultimate
embrace of nihilism (see 4.4) is probably his most un-Nietzschean
moment, the instant in which his thought radically [devalues
life]{.mark} and focuses with a fascinated gaze on that which is most
terrible --- death. In a popular French reading of Nietzsche,
[his]{.mark} 'transvaluation of values' demanded [negation of all
repressive]{.mark} and life- negating [values]{.mark} [in favor]{.mark}
of [affirmation of life,]{.mark} joy and happiness. [This
'philosophy]{.mark} of value' [valorized life]{.mark} over death and
derived its values from phenomena which enhanced, refined and nurtured
human life. [In Baudrillard]{.mark}, by contrast, [life does not exist
as]{.mark} an autonomous source of [value, and the body exists only as
'the caarnality of signs]{.mark}]{.underline},' as a mode of display of
signification. His sign fetishism erases all materiality from the body
and social life, and makes possible a fascinated aestheticized fetishism
of signs as the primary ontological reality. [[This]{.mark} way of
seeing [erases suffering, disease, pain and the horror of death]{.mark}
from the body and social life [and replaces it with the play of
signs]{.mark} --- [Baudrillard's alternative. Politics]{.mark} too [is
reduced to]{.mark} a play of [signs]{.mark}, and [the ways in which
different politics alleviate or intensify]{.mark} human [suffering
disappears]{.mark}]{.underline} from the Baudrillardian universe.
Consequently Baudrillard's theory spirals into a fascination with signs
which leads him to embrace certain privileged forms of sign culture and
to reject others (that is, the theoretical signs of modernity such as
meaning, truth, the social, power and so on) and to pay less and less
attention to materiality (that is, to needs, desire, suffering and so
on) [[a trajectory will]{.mark} ultimately [lead him to embrace
nihilism]{.mark}]{.underline} (see 4.4).

the Evil Demon of the Simulacrum" Economy and Society Volume 30 Number
1)

[[The power of the simulacrum]{.mark}, therefore, [may]{.mark} prove to
[be **greater than Baudrillard realized**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On a
personal level this is certainly the case. In a candid 1984--5 interview
he reveals that his courtship of its demon became an unlivable
experience: 'I stopped working on simulation. I felt I was going totally
nuts' (1993a: 105). The simulacrum, however, could not be so easily
disposed of. Despite his desire to 'cast off this yoke of simulacres and
simulation' (1993a: 184), the 'simulacrum' has thrived, becoming an idea
popularly and irrevocably identified with Baudrillard. [[It has]{.mark},
appropriately, [exerted its]{.mark} simulacral [power to appear]{.mark}
in the popular imagination as the real philosophy of Jean
Baudrillard]{.underline}, eclipsing his critique, and all other aspects
of his work and career. Journalistic commentary and student texts are
typical here in identifying the simulacrum as Baudrillard's sole
approved project. Thus the problem of finding Baudrillard's flat is
turned into an obvious and banal hook by one interviewer, who takes the
opportunity to enquire whether 'Baudrillard himself . . . might be a
simulacrum': Does he really exist? (Leith 1998: 14). More importantly
for Baudrillard, however, is the simulacral efficacy of doubling -- the
theoretical strategy of employing simulation which, quite naturally, has
a simulacral effect. The theory of simulation Baudrillard did not
believe in has now been realized: as the Japanese interviewer makes
clear, the simulacrum has become reality. Volatized in, and as, the
real, its victory is the concept's defeA2: once it is 'true', the
simulacrum becomes a commonplace, robbed of its capacity to arouse the
world's denial and thus its critical force: if there is nothing beyond
the simulacrum then it is not even open to question but is simply 'our
absolute banality, our everyday obscenity' (Zurbrugg 1997: 11). Hence
Baudrillard's emphasis upon the theoretical challenge of the simulacrum.
Once realized, unless -- as Baudrillard hopes -- it can itself be
reversed against simulation, then this critical function is lost.
[[Opposing Baudrillard]{.mark} with the simulacrum -- with its success
-- [is]{.mark}, therefore, [the most effective means of
critique]{.mark}]{.underline}. For his work is not wrong, but too true:
[[the simulacrum has become reality]{.mark} and **[this is his
end]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the game is over. It is, therefore, in the
hyperdefence of Baudrillard that we find a means of leaving him behind.
With his success, Baudrillard disappears. [[If we want him to
survive]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we must **condemn him** as a nihilistic
proponent of the simulacrum and oppose him with an outraged]{.mark},
vituperic, [moral appeal to reality]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Kellner and
Norris do; thereby restoring his work to life. For, if it is only in its
contradiction that it can live as a provocation and diabolical
challenge, then once it is true this ends. Kellner and Norris,
therefore, may yet prove to be Baudrillard's greatest defenders.
Baudrillard, of all people, should have anticipated his disappearance,
for the simulacrum's demonic power rests also in its attraction for, and
hold over, humanity. Aristotle, for example, recognized this, writing of
this instinctive pleas- ure of imitation in man, 'the most imitative of
living creatures' (1997: 5), while Nietzsche also speaks of 'the delight
in simulation' and of its effects in 'explod- ing as a power that pushes
aside one's so-called "character", 􏰝 ooding it and at times
extinguishing it' (1974: para. 361). One courts this demon, therefore,
at one's own risk, as it captivates and ovearwhelms our personality. As
the author of the Psalms cautioned the makers and worshippers of idols,
'they that make them are like unto them: so is everyone who trusteth in
them' (Barasch 1992: 20). The efficacy of simulation and the danger of
disappearance are key themes in Roger Caillois' influential essay on
animal mimicry and the mimetic instinct -- no less powerful in insects
than in man (Caillois 1984). The instinct of mimesis parallels primitive
magic, Caillois says, though it is a mimetic spell which is too strong
for those who cast it. For the insects it is a spell which has 'caught
the sorcerer in his own trap' (1984: 27) -- Phylia, for example, 'browse
among them- selves, taking each other for real leaves' (1984: 25). So,
Caillois argues, simulation absorbs the simulator, leading to their
mimetic 'assimilation to the surroundings' with a consequent
'psychasthenic' loss of distinction, personality, and also, in a
thanatophilic movement, the loss of the signs of life itself (1984: 28,
30). Simulation, therefore, 􏰜 nally overwhelms the simulator: as
Caillois warns in the epigram which opens his article, 'Take care: when
you play with phantoms, you may become one' (1984: 17). So Baudrillard's
game has the same result. [If **[the simulacrum has been
realized]{.mark}**; if simulation is now our everyday banality, then
[Baudrillard is condemned to a lifeless disappearance as a sorcerer
trapped by his own magical invocation]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[absorbed
by his own simulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Baudrillard may not
believe in the ghost of the simulacrum, but he himself becomes this very
ghost. His game with phantoms ends, as Caillois knew it would, with his
own phantasmatic transformation, with his apparitional disappearance.
But this is only fitting, for in the pact with the devil it is always
your soul that is the stake.

[I shall not venture to judge whether [Baudrillard's
diagnosis]{.mark}]{.underline} of postmodern society is accurate,
although it appears that many of Germany's current writers agree with
him or were influenced by postmodern theories of late 20th-century
consumerist societies. I can, however, [say in conclusion that it **[is
not helpful]{.mark}** or productive on either an individual or social
level in imagining ways of living in today's world]{.underline}. As
Steven Best points out: Baudrillard's radical rejection of
referentiality is premised upon a one-dimensional, No-Exit world of
self-referring simulacra. But, [[however]{.mark}, reified and
[self-referential postmodern semiotics is,]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[signs do not simply move in their own signifying
orbit]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[They are **historically
produced**]{.mark} and circulated and while they may not translucently
refer to some originating world, [they]{.mark} none the less [can **be
socio-historically contextualized**]{.mark}, interpreted, and
critiqued.]{.underline}(57) In other words, [human beings generate the
simulacra in [specific historical contexts]{.mark} that [are **subject
to interpretation and challenge**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Regardless of
how pervasively the media spin our reality, **[real people suffer

**[[prosper]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[because of political

level]{.underline}. [[Media images]{.mark} may overpower us, but they
**[shouldn't make us lose sight of the real ramifications of political
and economic development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many critics have
suggested that Baudrillard's chief accomplishment was to serve as an
agent provocateur. In an interview with Mike Gane, Baudrillard himself
saw his method of reflection as "provocative, reversible, \[ . . . \] a
way of raising things to the 'N'th power \[ . . . \] [**[It's]{.mark}**
a bit **[like a theory-fiction]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Poster 331).
[One could argue that this is precisely the function of such novels and
short stories as the ones examined here: to provoke us]{.underline}.
**[[But to what end?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Naters, Regener, and Hermann
all write very readable literature, and they challenge us to understand
the world of the insipid, self-centered, and myopic characters that they
have created. It would indeed be a disservice to the authors to imply
that they do not view their own characters with critical distance. Thus,
I am not suggesting that they believe their readers should emulate the
characters they have created. They have not, however, successfully
demonstrated either why we should care about them or---more
importantly---what we can learn from them.

With this sort of example as inspiration, one hopes that scholars of
neoliberal nature would take on Castree\'s task. Yet one can anticipate
refusals (and this pertains directly to Castree\'s two final questions,
about the effects of nature\'s neoliberalization and their evaluation).
Some will argue that \`neoliberalism\' is constituted of a range of
diverse, locally rooted practices, thereby justifying a sector-specific,
case-study approach for which attempts at terminological systematization
are of little utility. This is, as Castree notes, an evasion rather than
a convincing response. [A more compelling argument is that [the
biophysical characteristics of resources and associated resource
economies differ so greatly that expedience]{.mark} (and analytical
rigour) [demands a high degree of specialization.]{.mark} But the most
fundamental objection (and one that Castree overlooks) is that [the
chain of causality in the study of environmental impacts arising
from]{.mark} projects of [neolib]{.mark}eralization [is so attenuated,
and]{.mark} the [confounding variables so numerous]{.mark} (particularly
given the multiple scales of regulation and resource production
involved), [that **it is almost impossible to prove that the
environmental \`impacts\' we might identify do indeed arise from a
particular strategy identified as neoliberal.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Only by tracing the various methods through which certain bodies have been posited through history can we understand various forms of oppression

Philosophy, 2008, "The Browning of the All Blacks: Pacific Peoples,

Before I begin, I would just like to offer a few comments on the
relationships between and the social construction of the body and
'race.' First, an enormous amount of scholarship has traced the
interconnections between racism and the body, showing how the body has
been central to the construction of the concept of race. It is not my
intention to revisit this literature here (see instead Jackson, 2006).
However, it is perhaps important to highlight that my readings herein
take the body as socially understood, with the body treated as a
discursive text. This is in keeping with how the body in social theory
has come to been seen less as biologically given and fixed than as both
culturally and historically specific. [[The body is no longer considered
'natural']{.mark}]{.underline} or as trans(/a)historical, [[but rather
as "a site where]{.underline}]{.mark} regimes of [[discourse and power
inscribe themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}, a nodal point or nexus for
relations of juridical and productive power" (Butler, 1989, p. 601).
Within this broad literature, [[bodily identities
are]{.underline}]{.mark} viewed as "[[inextricable from
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Oates and Durham, 2004, p. 305; see
Bordo, 1993; Butler, 1990, 1993; Foucault, 1978, 1980). [[Through
language, image, narrative structure, and]{.underline}]{.mark} other
forms of [[discursive practice,]{.underline}]{.mark} the body is
'produced' and human activity actively organized (Smart, 1983). This is
not to suggest that the body necessarily lacks 'physicality' (that is,
an 'organic' dimension), that biology is separate to the social, but
rather that [[the body "emerges with the social"]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Evers, 2006, p. 233). The body is not ontologically distinct from the
process of construction, yet "closer analysis of the way in which
individuals and groups manage their bodies, either as sets of social
practices or system of signs, or the ways in which states coerce bodies
and insert them into relations of power, leaves little doubt that the
body is a socially constructed phenomenon" (Booth and Nauright, 2003).
Put differently, in Butler's (1990) terms: there is an 'outside' to what
is constructed by discourse, but this is not an absolute 'outside', an
ontological thereness that exceeds or counters the boundaries of
discourse; as a constitutive 'outside', it is that which can only be
thought in relation to that discourse, at and as its most tenuous
borders. (p. 8). While we often (mis)take the body as a 'natural'
phenomenon (or, as prior to discourse), asserting it to be
culturally-constructed also means taking it as contingent, learned, and
historically malleable. The meanings or attributes the body acquires
are, according to Butler (1989, p. 601), "in fact culturally constituted
and variable." As a consequence, and though it may sound tautological,
[[the body can be taken as a]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of [[embodied
history]{.underline}]{.mark}. On one level this means we can 'read' or
'interpret' the body in much the same way as any historical 'text.'
Indeed, until recently, the bulk of research within the sociology of the
body has concerned representational issues, examining what Turner (1994,
p. viii) describes as "the symbolic significance of the body as a
metaphor of social relationships." Research in this regard has been
heavily influenced by the work of Michel Foucault, who (arguably \[see,
Dudrick, 2005\]), shifted the focus away from bodies per se to the
discourses which shape and give bodies meaning. In his seminal essay,
"Nietzsche, Genealogy, History," [[Foucault positions the physical body
as a "virtual text"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Adair, 2001, p. 453), labeling
the body [[as an "inscribed surface of events that are traced by
language and dissolved by ideas]{.underline}]{.mark}." In this, Foucault
points toward "a body that is given form through semiotic systems and
written on by discourse" (Adair, 2001, p. 453). Foucault elsewhere
points to representational aspects, variously describing bodies as
"foundations where language leaves its traces" and "the writing pad\[s\]
of the sovereign and the law." Whereas the body was once thought of as a
predetermined, biological fact, [[Foucault]{.underline}]{.mark} instead
[[gives call]{.underline}]{.mark} to think of and critique the body as
it is invested with meaning[[, to consider]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
particular, [[the way dimensions of social difference,]{.mark} such as
class, race and gender, [are]{.mark}]{.underline} (as Foucault puts it)
'[[inscribed' on the body]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given impetus from
Foucault, the wealth of recent theorizing on the body is devoted to this
idea of the body as written on and through discourse (Schildkrout,
2004). Following Foucault there have been multiple, varied, and often
conflicting, definitions and interpretations of what 'inscription' and
'body' actually mean. Generally though, Foucault's suggestion that the
body is "a text upon which social reality is inscribed" (Schildkrout,
2004, p. 319) is taken in a more metaphorical than literal sense,
particularly within poststructuralist scholarship (for an exception, see
Fleming, 2001). In explaining this distinction, Brush (1998, p. 28)
notes how inscription as a metaphor "is not superficial (despite the
fact that \[inscription\] may be read on the surface of the body)."
Foucault, she argues, is instead saying something stronger: that "the
constitution of the body rests in its inscription; the body becomes the
text which is written upon it and from which it is indistinguishable"
(p. 22). As Grosz (1994, p. 142) explains it, [the]{.underline}
different [procedures of cultural inscription]{.underline} "do not
simply adorn or add to a body that is basically given through biology;
they help [constitute the very biological organization of the
subject]{.underline}." If the body is---metaphorically---a site of
inscription to various degrees for various theorists, then it is in the
sense that the body "has a determinate form only by being socially
inscribed" (Grosz, 1987, p. 2). These bodily inscriptions serve their
most significant purpose in placing the body within a cultural matrix.
[[At the moment]{.underline}]{.mark} at which [[the body enters culture
it becomes implicated in]{.mark}]{.underline} the play of
[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}. Certain identifiable 'characteristics'
relate directly to power dynamics; as Grosz (1990) puts it, "power
produces the body as a determinate type, with particular features,
skills, and attributes" (p. 149). In particular, [[power deploys
discourses]{.underline}]{.mark} on and [[over bodies to constitute them
as particular bodies]{.underline}]{.mark} (normal/abnormal,
superior/inferior etc); or, to follow from above, bodies are inscribed
in diverse, and often contradictory, ways. [Otherness]{.underline}
therefore [emerges from the positioning]{.underline}, interpreting, and
[conferring of meaning upon bodies]{.underline}. So, in this case, race
may appear as an attribute yet it is only when inscribed by discourse
that the body's specific meaning is determined. Obviously, the idea of
race was initially founded upon visible bodily differences, and we have
come to regard these forms of observed difference as significant. That
it has long since been discovered that there is no biological basis for
distinguishing among human groups along the lines of race means that
what is critical is understanding how and why these differences have
come to matter; how have these "bodily schemas", to borrow from Fanon,
become established and how are they reproduced? What is most salient in
this regard is to acknowledge that 'race' "cannot be abstracted from the
social and political environment within which it is defined and lived"
(Johnston, 2001, p. 72). [[Races]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Paul Gilroy
notes, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} not "simply expressions of either
biological or cultural sameness. They are imagined--- [[socially and
politically constructed]{.underline}]{.mark}" (1993, p. 20). The
meanings associated with inscribed bodies "are conditioned by the
particular discursive formations in operation" (Tyner, 2004, p. 113). We
need, therefore, to contextualize the act of racialization, "the process
through which groups come to be designated as different, and on that
basis are subjected to differential and unequal treatment" (Dei and
Kempf, 2006, p. 9). [Race has to be considered as a product of the
meanings attributed to physical appearance at particular points in
time]{.underline}. As Miles (1993) writes, The visibility of somatic
characteristics is not inherent in the characteristics themselves, but
arise from a process of signification by which meaning is attributed to
certain of them. In other words, visibility is socially constructed in a
wider set of structural constraints (p. 87).
