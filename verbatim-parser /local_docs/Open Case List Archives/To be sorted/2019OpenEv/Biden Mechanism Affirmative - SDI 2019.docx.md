### General Overview

#### The affirmative [changes Congress' role]{.underline} in the Arms Export Control Act to make it [easier for them to block arms sales]{.underline} to countries that they disapprove of engaging.

#### Currently, if Congress wants to block an arms sale, they have to pass a [resolution of disapproval]{.underline} that rejects the president's sale. This task is made [extremely difficult]{.underline} by the fact that such a resolution would require a [two-thirds majority]{.underline} in [both chambers]{.underline} to overcome the president's [likely veto]{.underline}. It is further complicated by the fact that the creators of this system hoped that the mere threat of Congressional confrontation would change the president's behavior. This [faith in norms]{.underline} is undercut by President [Trump's personality]{.underline} and [distain for the Democratic House]{.underline}. Altogether, it is worth noting that Congress [has never blocked an arms sale via a joint resolution of disapproval.]{.underline} 

#### The affirmative changes this status quo by [inverting Congress' role]{.underline}. Instead of only having the power to disapprove of arms sales, the plan amends the Arms Export Control Act to [require a vote of approval for arms sales]{.underline} by [both chambers]{.underline} of Congress. The idea was created by former Vice President and new Presidential Candidate Joe Biden. The aff is best described in the 1AC [Ford]{.underline} evidence. Other descriptions of it are in the [Thrall and Dorminey]{.underline} card on the arms sales advantage and the [Ohlbaum and Stohl]{.underline} on the presidential powers advantage, which talks about the analogous version of this Congressional role in the context of [trade agreements]{.underline}.

#### There are [two advantages]{.underline} to the affirmative

#### [First]{.underline} -- [arms sales]{.underline} -- The Thrall and Dorminey article says that if Congress has a greater role over arms sales, they will prevent dangerous sales to violent, human rights abusing countries. The impacts are about arms sales [causing war]{.underline}, [hindering international law]{.underline}, and allowing [human rights abuses]{.underline}.

#### [Second]{.underline} -- [prez powers]{.underline} -- Ford says that if Congress reasserted its authority over arms sales, it would increase Congressional power [versus executive authority]{.underline}. Such an outcome is desirable given that presidential powers [risk nuclear war]{.underline} via accidents and miscalculation, cause [polarization]{.underline} that hurts heg, and [undermine Congressional effectiveness.]{.underline}

### Strategy

#### This mechanism can be used to [supplement]{.underline} other affirmatives (i.e. being a way that those affirmatives reduce the arms sales that they are concerned with) or as a [stand-alone aff]{.underline}.

#### [Plan options 1 and 2]{.underline} should how a team could [add]{.underline} this mechanism to their existing 1AC. If a team opted to do so, they would [only]{.underline} read the [presidential powers advantage with the aff-specific advantage of their choice]{.underline}. They would [not]{.underline} read the [arms sales advantage]{.underline} because existing affs (Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, Taiwan, etc.) already have a defense of reducing arms sales. Reading the presidential powers advantage is important, though, because it is an [offensive defense of the affirmative's process]{.underline} against CPs. For instance, a 1AC could be:

-Plan Option 1 OR 2

-Presidential Powers Advantage

-CCP Advantage (from Taiwan)

-Relations Advantage (from Taiwan)

#### [Plan option 3]{.underline} allows for a standalone version of the aff. Clearly, this version of the affirmative is the [most generic]{.underline} defense of reducing arms sales possible. Altogether, the 1AC would be:

-Plan Option 3

-Presidential Powers Advantage

-Arms Sales Advantage

### Organization

#### Aff-specific arguments (case, the soft law CP, the HR 7080 CP, and T-Reduce) are all in the Biden Mechanism aff and neg files. The politics DA, security K, cred DA, fill-in DA, economy DA and heg bad arguments are in separate files.

#### Apologies for the long F6 headings. I'd strongly suggest extending your navigation pane or altering the block titles. 

# CASE

## \*\*\* PLANS

### Option 1

#### The United States Congress should require the President of the United States to seek affirmative support from Congress before the Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of arms and reject such requests for sales of arms to the Republic of China.

### Option 2

#### The United States Congress should require the President of the United States to seek affirmative support from Congress before the Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of arms and reject such requests for sales of high-end weapons to the Republic of China.

### Option 3

#### The United States Congress should require the President of the United States to seek affirmative support from Congress before the Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of arms.

## \*\*\* ARMS SALES

### 1AC

#### Trump has [breached restricting norms]{.underline} on arms sales -- current Congressional checks [fail]{.underline} and [require updating]{.underline}

Like no other time in recent memory, **[[Congress is losing]{.mark} the
war for [its rightful place]{.mark} in American
governance]{.underline}**. President **[[Trump]{.mark}'s distaste
for]{.underline}** the norms that have traditionally **[limited the
authority of his office have [battered the separation of
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a founding principle of American
political life and an essential bulwark against presidential overreach.
And when it comes to the weighty decision to transfer American weapons
beyond our shores, our president has shown that **[[the balance]{.mark}
of power between the executive and legislative branches [has
come]{.mark} to list [dangerously to one
side]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Indeed[, **[the president's]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[unflinching and
unrestrained [determination to send arm]{.mark}ament[s]{.mark} [to Saudi
Arabia and the U]{.mark}nited [A]{.mark}rab
[E]{.mark}mirates]{.underline}** --- over the objections of lawmakers,
civil society and the public at large [---
**[illustrates]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[perfectly that, in the battle
for the weapons of war, [Congress has stumbled into its
Waterloo]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If nothing else, **[the president's
[recent efforts reflect]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}just how much of
[**[Congress' historical oversight of U.S. arms
sales]{.underline}**]{.mark} has been based on norms rather than laws,
and on policy rather than on statute.

In May[, **[Trump]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, laying bare just how feeble
Congress' grip on the arms sales process really is[, declared an
"emergency" that bypassed]{.mark} the legally required [congressional
review]{.mark} process]{.underline}** and expedited the transfer of
weapons to Abu Dhabi and Riyadh that will likely find their way to the
frontlines of Yemen's civil war.

Though **[the invocation of [the president's emergency]{.mark} authority
[was a flagrant breach of traditional norms]{.mark},]{.underline}** it
offers a revealing insight[: **[We have]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[endowed [Congress]{.mark} with [insufficient]{.mark} statutory
[authority to play a meaningful role in]{.mark} overseeing and
scrutinizing the [arms sales process]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Under the]{.underline}** Arms Export Control Act
(**[AECA]{.underline}**), the principal piece of legislation governing
the U.S. arms trade, **[Congress is enshrined as an important arbiter in
the arms sales process]{.underline}**. While the executive branch
develops arms sales proposals, it is through Congress that the public
gets its so sole input into the process.

Congress is where elected officials, representing the American people,
can voice their concerns. **[Unfortunately, the structure of [the
law]{.mark} effectively [ensures]{.mark} that, [when the administration
wants to push]{.mark} guns, bombs and other [weapons systems]{.mark} to
far-flung parts of the world, [there is little]{.mark} lawmakers can do
[to stop them]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Under the law, [Congress must receive a 30-day]{.mark} formal
[notification before a sale]{.mark} can proceed, [giving]{.mark} them
[an opportunity to block the sale]{.mark}]{.underline}** through a joint
resolution of disapproval, **[requiring a majority in both bodies of
Congress to take effect]{.underline}**. As if passage of bicameral
legislation was not enough of a barrier, the bill can then be vetoed by
the president who, presumably, supports his or her own proposed arms
sale. Congress must then muster a two-thirds majority in both houses to
override the president, something that has occurred in fewer than 10
percent of all presidential vetoes and has never successfully been done
with respect to arms sales.

**[[Under previous administrations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, an informal
negotiation process between Congress and the White House moderated the
overwhelming statutory power of the executive branch. The normative
system ensured that **[[sales were]{.mark} only [introduced once a
consensus]{.mark} had [formed that lawmakers would approve them]{.mark}.
Congressional [concerns were addressed before]{.mark} the formal
[notification]{.mark}]{.underline}** and accounted for within the
administration's deliberations. Though imperfect, **[[the practice acted
as a check on an administration's sales authority and]{.mark}
theoretically [gave Congress the power to]{.mark} indefinitely [prevent
certification.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[But]{.underline}** because this was an informal system, predicated on
executive deference to its co-equal branch of government, we should not
be surprised that **[[Trump has shown little patience for
it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead**[, we are forced now to rely on the
letter of the law --- which all but ensures that [this
administration]{.mark}, and any subsequent one, [can sell arms when and
to whom it wants without respect to the wishes of Congress or the
public. That has to change.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Unchecked executive arms sales cause [global instability]{.underline} and [worse wars]{.underline} -- focus on the [institution of transfers]{.underline} not [specific sales]{.underline} -- blowback, dispersion, and longer/worse wars

Sales," CATO Institute, initially published in *War on the Rocks*, 6/13,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/new-framework-assessing-risks-us-arms-sales

**[The]{.underline}** **[Risks of Arms Sales]{.underline}**

**[Arms sales are attractive]{.underline}** for many reasons. **[They
offer a]{.underline}** low-cost, flexible **[way to help allies and
partners]{.underline}** wage wars, **[deter]{.underline}** adversaries,
**[and fight]{.underline}** terrorism. Moreover, arms sales and
transfers certainly pose less political danger for presidents than
sending American troops into harm's way. **[But]{.underline}** **[just
because the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has good [reasons to sell weapons in a
specific instance do]{.mark}es [not mean]{.mark} the [benefits are a
sure thing]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[[nor does it
ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the **[[benefits]{.mark} will
[outweigh]{.mark} the [costs.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The **[[negative]{.mark} side [effects]{.mark} of arms sales
[take]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[many forms]{.underline}**.
**[One]{.underline}** **[extreme]{.underline}** **[example is
blowback]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[--- when American]{.underline}**s
**[weapons end up being used against American interests. [After the
Iran]{.mark}ian [Rev]{.mark}olution]{.underline}** in 1979,
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** revolutionary **[[government
took]{.underline}]{.mark}** possession of [**[billions of
dollars']{.underline}** **[worth of American]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[fighter [jets and]{.mark}]{.underline}** other **[[weapons]{.mark},
an arsenal]{.underline}** that **[Iran]{.underline}** **[has used [to
exert itself]{.mark} ever since]{.underline}**. **[A more common example
is when American troops end up fighting]{.underline}** other
**[forces]{.underline}** armed **[with American]{.underline}**-made
**[weapons]{.underline}** that the United States had willingly provided,
**[as happened in Somalia in 1991]{.underline}** with weapons provided
during the Cold War.

**[[Arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}** and transfers
**[can]{.underline}** also **[[harm]{.mark} the
[regions]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[into which American weapons flow.
[Another danger is dispersion]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[when weapons
sold]{.underline}** to a foreign government **[end up in the hands of
criminal groups or adversaries]{.underline}**. This risk is highest with
sales or transfers to fragile states that are unprepared, unwilling, or
too corrupt to protect their stockpiles adequately. For instance,
despite America's efforts to train and equip the Iraqi army,
**[[ISIL]{.mark} fighters in 2014 [captured]{.mark} three Iraqi army
divisions' worth of American equipment, including
[tanks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, armored vehicles, and infantry weapons.

**[American arms [sales can]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[prolong and
intensify]{.mark} interstate [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[Although the goal might be]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to alter the
military [balance]{.mark}]{.underline}** of a conflict **[to facilitate
a speedy end, sending [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[can]{.mark}
also [encourage]{.mark} the [recipients to continue
fighting]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[even with no chance]{.mark} of
success,]{.underline}** **[[leading to]{.mark} more
[casualties]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### [Reject defenses]{.underline} of arms sales -- they [increase instability]{.underline}

Sales," *Defense One*,
<https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/04/false-promises-trumps-arms-sales/156071/>

Unfortunately, **[[Trump's promises]{.mark} about the benefits of arms
sales [are mostly empty, while the dangers are all too
real]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Advocates of arms exports have long argued that]{.mark} such [sales
are critical for]{.mark} promoting [regional stability]{.mark} in
trouble spots around the world. [But American arms exports]{.mark} to
the Middle East [are doing the exact opposite.]{.mark} Arms export
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute **[[show that the U.S. share of arms sales]{.mark} to
the Middle East [has steadily increased over the past 15 years,
yet]{.mark} with conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and throughout North Africa,
[the region is as unstable as ever. American]{.mark} arms
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates **[have already [enabled]{.mark} those [nations to]{.mark}
carry out a bloody and catastrophic war in Yemen, which has
[kill]{.mark}ed [thousands of civilians, displace]{.mark}d [most of the
population, and put millions more at risk of starvation and
disease]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By continuing to sell weapons to Saudi
Arabia even after attempts in the U.S. Senate to halt them, the Trump
administration will encourage more Saudi intervention, further
destabilizing the region.

And though presidents tout export of arms as a good way to strengthen
allies, the truth is **[that [the United States doesn't just sell
weapons to responsible nations]{.mark} such as Italy, the United
Kingdom, and Belgium. [Vast amounts of U.S. weapons are shipped to risky
customers]{.mark}: fragile states like Turkey, nations embroiled in
conflicts like Saudi Arabia, and oppressive governments with horrendous
human rights records like Egypt, Bahrain, and the United Arab
Emirates]{.underline}**. Since 2001, the U.S. government has notified
the public of arms sales totaling over \$560 billion to 167 countries.
**[[Each of these sales adds]{.mark} a varying degree of [risk
to]{.mark} the United States regarding [potential blowback,
entanglement, dispersion, and increasing instability throughout the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Resultant wars [escalate]{.underline} and [go nuclear]{.underline}

New Strategic Approach to Fragile States", May, p. 1-3

This paper argues that the changing national security landscape requires
a comprehensive, strategic approach toward fragile states, defined as
those at the highest risk of coups, conflicts, or mass atrocities.
**[[Threats]{.mark} to]{.underline}** American national **[security
[including terrorism, pandemics, and]{.mark} the [spread of]{.mark}
violence and [conflict emanate]{.mark} increasingly [from fragile
states]{.mark}. State [fragility has]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[emerged as a]{.underline}]{.mark}** leading **[[impediment
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** human **[[development, trapping]{.mark}
many]{.underline}** of the world's poorest individuals and states **[[in
a cycle of poverty]{.mark} and violence]{.underline}**. In the absence
of a more proactive strategy towards fragile states, a growing portion
of U.S. assistance and military resources are now spent responding to
conflicts and atrocities after they occur -- an approach that is both
costly and ineffective.

In the wake of 9/11, the United States significantly expanded its focus
on the links between state weakness in the developing world and threats
to U.S. security. The 2002 National Security Strategy highlighted that
"weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our
national interests as strong states." But while the U.S. government
developed new strategies to aid poor but well-governed states and to
coordinate reconstruction efforts in the wake of conflicts, it has yet
to develop and implement an effective framework for responding to
fragile countries on the brink of crises. This represents a significant
gap and misalignment of U.S. resources against 21st century challenges.

From Southeast Asia to West Africa to Central America, many fragile
states are key U.S. security partners that collaborate in efforts to
counter violent extremism, disrupt transnational crime and trafficking
networks, and promote regional stability. The United States has critical
security interests and engagements with these states, which can and
should be reconciled with U.S. investments in fostering stable
development and effective governance. As the next U.S. administration
takes office, the time is ripe for a new strategic approach toward
fragile states.

This is the first in a series of four briefs proposing a strategic
framework for understanding and responding to fragile states. This
series will include:

• The case for prioritizing fragile states and investing in the
prevention of state crises,

• An examination of key definitional issues and the state of research on
the factors that contributes to state fragility,

• Options for addressing fragility in partner states through
development, diplomatic, and military engagement, and

• Specific bureaucratic and legislative reforms necessary to implement
the strategy.

WHY FRAGILE STATES?

**[[From]{.mark} the collapse of [Syria and]{.mark} the rise
of]{.underline}** the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant **[[(ISIL),
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[Ebola]{.underline}]{.mark}** outbreak
in West Africa, **[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[terrors of Boko
Haram]{.underline}** in **[[Nigeria]{.mark}, the consequences of state
fragility are confronting]{.underline}** Americans **[today in dramatic
new ways. The complex web of state [fragility]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
its consequences **[[poses a]{.mark}n increasingly serious
[challenge]{.mark} to]{.underline}** American
**[security]{.underline}**, making the reconsideration of America's
current approach to fragile states a security, fiscal, and moral
imperative.

**[[When]{.mark} fragility is [not addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
or addressed insufficiently -- **[[crises ensue. States that]{.mark}
collapse or [lose control]{.mark} over security within their borders
[become]{.mark} breeding grounds and safe [havens
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** brutally violent **[extremist
[groups]{.mark},]{.underline}** like ISIL,
**[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}** often move on to
**[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark}** neighboring states and **[[the
world]{.mark} at large. [As]{.mark} the conflicts in [Ukraine and Yemen
illustrate]{.mark}, internal [fragility can]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[make]{.mark} weak [states susceptible to interventions]{.mark} by
regional powers]{.underline}** that use political manipulation and proxy
military forces to expand their own influence. **[State [fragility can
have spillover effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as well; rising violence
in Central America and the conflict in Syria have produced dramatic
numbers of migrants **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** refugees. In states
undermined by ethnic and religious tensions, government repression can
**[[quickly spiral into large-scale violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
whether state-sponsored atrocities against a beleaguered minority or the
emergence of insurgencies and violent extremists.

Further from the headlines, but equally important, are the grinding,
incremental pressures that state fragility places on U.S. military
capacity to operate in concert with coalition partners in vital regions
of the world. Institutional weaknesses today in U.S. partner states such
as **[Tunisia and Thailand]{.underline}** not only undermine the
performance of those governments in addressing security challenges;
indeed, they also increase the risk that partner state regimes **[could
collapse]{.underline}** and be replaced by governments antithetical to
long-term U.S. security interests. Key U.S. security partners, including
**[Egypt, Mali, and Yemen, suffered]{.underline}** political
**[breakdowns in recent years, and [several]{.mark} more [are at
risk]{.mark} of destabilization, [underscoring the]{.mark} very [real
threat]{.mark} state fragility]{.underline}** poses to key U.S. security
alliances.

In addition to these national security challenges, the United States
also faces fiscal constraints that compel a reconsideration of the
current approach. In 2015, CIA Director John Brennan remarked that,
**[[over]{.mark} the past [three years, there have]{.mark} been
"[more]{.mark} outbreaks of [instability than]{.mark} at [any
point]{.mark} since just after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
matching the rate we saw during the period of decolonization in the
1960s]{.underline}**."ii Since 9/11, the United States has devoted over
\$455 billion in aid to countries immersed in or recovering from
fragility-related crises. Even more will be spent managing the expanding
crises in Libya, Yemen, South Sudan, and Syria. The United Nations (UN),
also stretched thin, reports that its responses to those four countries
represents the first time in history it has simultaneously dealt with
four "Level 3" crises -- the UN classification for the most severe,
large-scale emergencies. For the U.S., the implication is clear:
up-front investments to prevent crises would save lives, reduce the
burden on taxpayers of costly responses to catastrophes, and reserve
military action for only truly unavoidable conflicts.

#### Further, the [wars]{.underline} caused by arms sales thrash [international law]{.underline}

**[[The]{.mark} humanitarian [crisis in Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
where precision munitions provided by the United States have killed
scores of civilians, **[[is just the latest]{.mark} theater of [war
where American armaments are contributing to abuses of h]{.mark}uman
[r]{.mark}ights a[nd international humanitarian law, and]{.mark} it [is
unlikely to be]{.mark} the [last.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Congress was granted a role]{.mark} in the arms sales process [for
good reason]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Public scrutiny of arms sales is an
indispensable insurance policy against irresponsible transactions that,
for the sake of momentary expedience, risk ethical, moral and strategic
compromises. **[[For the]{.underline}]{.mark}** American **[[people, it
is our sole window into a]{.mark}n otherwise opaque [world. We can't
allow it to be closed]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Lawmakers]{.mark} who are]{.underline}** now **[working to
retroactively block arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE
[should]{.mark} consider [add]{.mark}ing [caveats to the president's
emergency authority]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The Saudi Arabia
False Emergencies (SAFE) Act, recently taken up by the Senate, is a good
start, and a promising opening salvo for their recuperation of authority
over arms transfer decision-making.

More importantly, the **[[bipartisan frustration with the
president's]{.mark} insistence on [sending
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** over the heads of lawmakers **[[should
catalyze a serious conversation on how the sales]{.mark} process [is
vetted]{.mark}]{.underline}** under the watchful gaze of the public
eye[, **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} just how **[[much power should
be]{.mark} vested [in the executive]{.mark} branch]{.underline}**.

Wednesday's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the
president's emergency declaration that expedited arms shipments to the
Gulf should serve as the new frontline in Congress's tug of war with the
White House[. **[Lawmakers should]{.underline}**]{.mark} not only demand
answers on this specific episode, but also **[[draw a line]{.mark} in
the sand]{.underline}** for their own authority **[[in the]{.mark}
broader [arms sales process]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Ultimately, in an era of partisanship[, **[enshrining a more direct role
for lawmakers in the arms sales process is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a
[good]{.mark} opportunity [for bipartisan
consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With a president who has shown norms
to be insufficient a check on executive power[, **[it
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[high [time]{.mark} that [lawmakers make
a]{.mark} final [stand for their role]{.mark} [as arbiters]{.mark} of
the exports [that enable warfare and conflict across the
globe.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

We face imminent financial collapse with scant collective will to

states]{.underline}** that are the main contributors

repeated scientific findings as 'the greatest hoax ever perpetrated'.1
**[Fisheries deplete, deserts expand, and aquifers
diminish]{.underline}**. International law scholarship, in the meantime,
takes a turn towards celebrating pluralism without sufficiently
accounting for institutional variation to address different contexts.
Those writing on global public goods challenges, at the same time, tend
to come from disciplines other than law.2¶ **[Increased transnational
interdependence recasts domestic issues into global ones]{.underline}**.
To give one mundane example, until 1997, corporate insolvency law in
Indonesia was considered a purely local matter. But with the onset of
the Asian financial crisis, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund,
and Asian Development Bank rethought domestic corporate insolvency law
as a global issue in light of the risks of financial contagion,
threatening a global public good, financial stability.3 Other
**[examples include]{.underline}** domestic banking regulation, tax
avoidance (given the impact on state sovereign debt crises), pest
control, **[public health, and civil conflict]{.underline}**. In
response, states create new international institutions and existing
international institutions expand their mandates. The UN Security
Council has expanded its mandate for overseeing international peace and
security to authorize 'humanitarian intervention', and the World Health
Organization has done so to address public health in response to the
SARS epidemic and similar threats.4 States and state institutions
sometimes create international club-like institutions with limited
membership, such as the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision, with the express aim of affecting
behaviour in non-members, such as over money laundering and bank capital
requirements.5

So what is international law's role in the production of global public
goods? Where are greater international legal constraints and
international institutions needed, and where should international law
retain slack? International law both is required to produce global
public goods and can potentially impede dynamic processes that are
needed to address global public goods challenges. This article provides
a framework for addressing these issues in light of variation in the
properties of global public goods (section 3), their distributive
implications (section 4), and alternative institutional choices for
confronting them, as reflected in different theoretical visions for
global governance advanced within international law scholarship (section
5). But first we address the rise of the legal pluralist vision
(section 1) and the tensions between it and the concept of global public
goods (section 2).

1 The Rise of the Legal Pluralist Vision

Legal pluralism seems a bit of a fad in international law scholarship
today, just as dialectical federalism may be a bit of a fad in the
United States, and constitutional pluralism in the European Union.6
Legal pluralism is a construct, a way of understanding and envisaging
the world, both positively (the way the world is) and normatively (the
way it should be). The challenge with the legal pluralist construct is
how it takes account of the global public goods challenges confronting
us.

What has led to the rise of this academic construct, its proliferation,
its catching on, its enticement of our imaginations? In part, the
concept resonates with our experience of multiple overlapping orders in
tension with each other, with no clear centre. In part, the concept
provides a normative vision of restructuring plural orders into
pluralist ones -- that is, re-envisaging them from fragmented, closed,
sovereign legal orders into an open, interacting, interlinked,
interdependent, multi-level structure of legal ordering. In part, it
particularly resonates with those writing in Europe, reflecting the
European experience with supranational law. The European experience,
encompassing both economic regulation and human rights protection, is
viewed as an experimental model and 'laboratory' for the ordering of a
global legal pluralism, one which provides order without centralized
hierarchy, hegemony, or the abandonment of public law principles to
transnational market forces.7

Yet the turn to a pluralist vision also has something to do with our
disenchantments, our disenchantment with international law, the limits
of the European experiment where a constitutional order exists but has
been formally rejected by its citizens, and the failure of progressive
politics in the US at the national level, spurring a strategic retreat
out of political necessity to bottom up progressive initiatives from
small municipal activist havens like Berkeley, California, and Madison,
Wisconsin. There are good reasons for such disenchantment within the US,
with the populist lure of the Tea Party's destructive rhetoric of any
sense of collective purpose, its members cheering at Republican debates
at the prospect of Americans dying because they do not have health
insurance. There are good reasons for this disenchantment in Europe with
little sense of solidarity in facing a crisis threatening the Euro, the
Union itself, and the world, with the biggest sovereign defaults in
history, ones that would dwarf earlier defaults in South America and
Asia. It is a crisis which -- to play with Hobbes' famous phrase --
could be nasty and brutish, but not short. And there are good reasons
for such disenchantment globally, with the cynicism of the Bush
administration's despising of international law in invading Iraq, its
trivializing of torture, and its ordering the freeze of individual
assets through Security Council resolutions with no concern for due
process. International law failed to constrain power when power chose to
belittle and ignore it, and it served to legitimize power when power
deigned to deploy it.

The concept of pluralism certainly captures much going on in the world
better than its occasional foil, the concept of constitutionalism.8
There is rarely any central hierarchy in international law. And even
where there is a glimpse of a shadow of hierarchy, such as decisions by
the UN Security Council or of the WTO Appellate Body, there always
follows the challenge of implementation. International law depends on
national systems and private actors to implement its dictates, and it
has little authority to ensure that they do so.

We have a fragmented plurality of legal orders spatially in at least
three senses.9 First, as international functional organizations
proliferate, we have a plurality at the international level --
constituting a horizontal plurality. Different semi-autonomous
international institutions address common issue areas in different ways.
At times actors may strategically create overlap among international
institutions to reorient international legal norms when they are unable
to trigger such change within an existing institution. The tensions
between the rules of the WTO and the Convention on Biodiversity and its
Biosafety Protocol are a salient example.10 Institutions with
overlapping mandates may also compete for leadership on a legal issue,
as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and Asian Development
Bank did during the Asian financial crisis.11

Secondly, we have a plurality of legal orders between levels of
governance -- constituting a vertical plurality. Since considerable
power remains at the nation state level, whether for producing detailed
law, implementing it, or enforcing it, international law must interact
with national law to be effective. In practice, domestic law and
institutions will always remain critical parts of a recursive process of
resistance, adoption, and adaptation of international legal norms, which
in turn can reshape those international norms.

Thirdly, in an economically interdependent world, private actors develop
non-public legal orders at the state and international levels. They are
sometimes encouraged by public actors that may later codify these
private legal norms, or enforce them judicially, or collaborate through
forming 'public--private partnerships'. We thus also have a plurality of
public and private legal orders.12

The concept of legal pluralism does not signify disorder -- per the
international relations trope of anarchy. Legal pluralism, with its
account of interacting legal orders, takes the idea of international law
seriously. Otherwise, there is nothing with which national legal systems
can interact, except with each other or with private legal ordering. The
normative vision of legal pluralism rather aims to foster transnational
and global legal order out of the plural; it aims to structure out of
the many one, but with the one constituted by the interactions of the
many.13

Legal Pluralism and the Challenge of Global Public Goods

Despite the appeal of the legal pluralist vision, one realizes in
reading thought-provoking authors on legal pluralism, such as Mireille
Delmas-Marty and Nico Krisch, that though they compellingly support
their arguments with examples and case studies, their case studies do
not focus on the challenges of global public goods. They do not, one
might conjecture, because there is a tension between the operation of
legal pluralism and the production of global public goods where
processes of pluralist interaction will provide too little too late.

That do we mean by a global public good? In economic theory, a public
good, in contrast to a private good, is one that is non-excludable (no
one can be excluded from the good's consumption) and non-rivalrous (the
good's consumption does not reduce its availability to others).14 Clean
air, for example, is a public good because it is not depleted by our
breathing it, and it cannot be appropriated by a few. The term 'good'
refers to a product, and not a normative attribute. A public good thus
can be positive (such as knowledge), or negative, a good that we wish to
curtail so that our aim is to produce its absence (such as terrorism).

Those promoting international cooperation often broaden the definition
of a public good classically used in economic theory, which was statist
in its initial focus, to encompass a larger number of issues for global
action. On the one hand, the two-fold 'publicness' of a good in practice
often lies along a continuum, so that goods may combine public and
private attributes, complicating the assessment of how to generate
them.15 On the other hand, one reason policy-makers arguably have
developed a broader definition of global public goods is to enhance the
scope for global governance projects and thus legitimize their
pursuit.16 The concept of global public goods, for example, was
originated under a project sponsored by the UN Development Programme
which seeks funding for projects. Inge Kaul and her collaborators,
leading that project, use a relaxed definition of public good as 'goods
with benefits that extend to all countries, people, and generations',17
while noting that the concept of public good is a social construction.18
Such expanded definitions, however, risk making the concept of global
public goods so malleable that it becomes abused, leading to scepticism
and cynicism regarding its relevance.19 As we will see in section 3, we
rather need to differentiate among different types of public goods in
order meaningfully to address the role of international law and
organizations in their production.

The major challenge for the production of many (but not all) global
public goods, as well as those public goods that are transnational (but
not global) in scope,20 and thus the challenge of celebrating legal
pluralism, is collective action and free riding. Nation states and other
actors will not invest in global public goods if their independent
action will have no impact, or if they can free ride on the investment
of others. To produce global public goods often requires a sense of
collective purpose based on mutual interests and understandings. To
arrive at that collective purpose, we need (for economists) an alignment
of incentives, and (for sociologists) socialization processes that lead
to a common identity (such as national citizens). We are then more
likely to cooperate and create institutions that invest in producing
public goods. The creation of nation states with general taxing powers
and a monopoly of the legitimate use of force facilitated the production
of national public goods. The development of the theory of public goods
correspondingly has been statist on account of the existence of
centralized decision-making in nation states which produce them.21

The most salient challenge internationally is that we lack legitimate,
centralized institutions with general taxing and regulatory powers. We
thus have traditionally depended on cooperation between nation states
involving decentralized forms of implementation and enforcement to
advance collective goals. International law facilitates this cooperation
through creating international institutions and common norms and rules,
thereby reducing transaction, monitoring, and enforcement costs and
building shared understandings.22 States created the UN and its Security
Council to help to ensure the global public good of international peace
and security. They created the World Health Organization to protect
public health from the spread of infectious diseases, the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change to address climate stabilization, the World
Trade Organization to address trade liberalization and help to manage
inter-state trade conflicts so that they do not escalate into 1930s
beggar-thy-neighbour policies, the Financial Action Task Force to
address money laundering of illicit funds, and the International
Monetary Fund to stabilize currency and sovereign debt crises. The
concerns addressed by these institutions can be viewed in global public
goods terms. Yet none of these institutions has a general taxing power
to address them. All of them depend on negotiations between states over
the amount of 'contributions'.

The Need to Differentiate between Global Public Goods

In order to assess the place and role of international law and
institutions to promote and govern the production of global public
goods, we need to differentiate among the range of public goods
challenges faced, as opposed to speaking of global public goods and
international law in the abstract. Global public goods come in different
varieties, calling for different institutional responses, sometimes
involving greater centralization through international law and
institutions, and sometimes not. There is no one size fits all, no one
optimal institutional structure. For the production of many global
public goods, legal pluralism, in which different legal orders interact
with each other, works fine. There may be little need for international
law, at least in its hard (mandatory) law variety, much less centralized
international institutions.

Since global public goods do not come in one variety, international law
plays a variable role in their production. As Scott Barrett
conceptualizes in his book Why Cooperate?: The Incentive to Supply
Global Public Goods,23 some global public goods raise collective action
problems and others do not. Barrett, following other economists,
classifies global public goods into three varieties: single best efforts
goods, weakest links goods, and aggregate efforts goods.24 An example of
a single best efforts public good, on the cover of his book, is the
crashing of a giant asteroid into the earth. All countries are affected
by this prospect. Scientists do not know when one will hit and what size
it will be, but they find that small ones hit the earth about once a
month, and estimate that potentially catastrophic ones that could
devastate an area the size of Manhattan every 250 years, and one that
could cause the extinction of most life forms every 65 million years.25
For this global public good, the US has the incentive to finance
research and implement technology to detect and deter such happenings.
No international treaty is required for it to do so. Other countries may
free ride on the US's research, or may engage in complementary research,
but that will not deter the US from investing.

Similarly, countries, companies, and even individual researchers have
incentives to invest in basic science on their own which can benefit the
world. Joseph Salk's development of the polio vaccine in the US was a
gift to the world, as he did not patent the polio vaccine.26 Such a good
can be produced by private initiatives (such as those of pharmaceutical
companies and of the Gates Foundation), purely national ones (such as
those of the National Institutes of Health), or international
collaborative ones (such as the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special
Programme in Tropical Diseases).27

Is there no required role for international law in these cases? Even in
the asteroid case, Barrett notes the potential negative externalities of
other countries relying on the US. The US may have the incentive to
invest in producing the global public good, but in a way that could
create a new risk. If an asteroid bears toward the earth, and if the
existing technology is such that the asteroid could only be slightly
deflected so that it would crash into a different part of the earth, who
should make the decision regarding its deflection? Even if it were to be
deflected into the ocean, the location of its impact would raise
differential risks for countries of a tsunami.28

Similarly, **[[geoengineering]{.mark} increasingly [looks]{.mark} like
an [important]{.mark} policy option [for climate
stabilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, given the world's inability to
reduce carbon emissions. It thus can be viewed as a global public good,
at least to avoid abrupt and catastrophic climate change.29 Since
engineering the climate may be relatively cheap, it could be a single
best efforts global public good. **[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** like
climate change itself, **[geoengineering may benefit some countries and
harm others. Climate engineering constitutes a huge experiment that
poses unforeseeable, differential risks]{.underline}** for countries in
light of uncertainties. A wealthy country may decide to invest in
geoengineering to assist its own climate situation, but in the process
have negative externalities on others. **[[If different countries
engage]{.mark} in climate engineering, their [plural efforts will
interact]{.mark}, potentially [undercutting]{.mark} [each other.]{.mark}
Coordination over climate change thus raises governance
challenges]{.underline}**. Who should decide whether and how the climate
should be engineered? Once again, **[[there is a role for international
law]{.mark} and international institutions [in coordinating
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}** even though only one or a few wealthy
countries invest in geoengineering on their own.

[**[Eliminating infectious diseases]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[curtailing]{.underline}**]{.mark} the proliferation of
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction **[[are weakest link public
goods]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A wealthy country can invest in preventing
an infectious disease within its borders through financing the
vaccination of its population each year. The US does so, for example,
with polio vaccines. Yet it would be much more cost effective to
eradicate polio, as the world did for smallpox in the 1970s. The
benefit-cost ratio for smallpox eradication is thought to be 159:1, if
all costs are included, and 483:1, if only international funds for
financing eradication efforts in developing countries are considered.30
That is a remarkable rate of return. Investing in polio eradication
could provide another global public good. Yet, in order to eradicate
polio, poor and failed states, such as Somalia, are the weakest links.

The **[World Health Organization, an international institution created
under the auspices of the UN]{.underline}** and inheriting the mandate
of an earlier institution created pursuant to the League of Nations,
**[leads the eradication efforts]{.underline}**. The WHO includes
distinct voting rules for its regulations on infectious diseases, which
facilitate collective action for collective purposes. The general rule
of international law of treaties is an 'opt in' rule. A state is not
bound unless it consents. Under Articles 21 and 22 of the WHO
constitution, however, a majority decision is binding on matters
involving 'procedures designed to prevent the international spread of
disease', unless a state opts out. The WHO created new International
Health Regulations in 2005 pursuant to these provisions, which require
states to build institutional capacity toward containing communicable
diseases, collaborate with each other, and maintain clear points of
contact.31 In parallel, the regulations expand the legal authority of
the WHO's Director-General to intervene in response to communicable
disease outbreaks, including through a system for convening experts and
declaring a public health emergency of international concern. As has
been shown experimentally and statistically, opt-out rules generate much
broader participation than do opt-in rules.32 No WHO member, in fact,
opted out of the 2005 International Health Regulations.33

**[Keeping weapons of mass destruction out of terrorist hands is another
weakest link global public good]{.underline}**. We do not know where or
when such weapons will be used, but the fallout of their use will have
global repercussions, whether for life and health, civil rights, or the
global economy. Countries thus have the incentive to keep these weapons
out of terrorist hands, but the result will depend on the weakest links.
The weakest links today are Pakistan, Russia, and North Korea. New
weakest links may emerge, as more states invest in nuclear technology to
gain advantage or parity with their rivals. States in 1968 signed the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was extended indefinitely
in 1995,34 and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material in 1987, amended in 2005.35 In addition, the UN Security
Council passed Resolution 1540 in 2004 which enjoins all states to take
measures to prevent nuclear weapons materials from being obtained by
non-state actors having 'terrorist purposes'.36 The non-proliferation
regime, however, has been under some risk of unravelling, as the Bush
administration created a special regime for India and reconsidered the
US's first strike options and weapons development plans.37

The severest global public goods challenge today is what Barrett calls
an aggregate efforts public good -- that is, where the global public
good can only be produced through the aggregate efforts of multiple
countries. The world appears to have been startlingly successful in
addressing the depletion of the ozone layer, starting with a framework
convention, then turning to hard law obligations that were progressively
enhanced, and then using soft law mechanisms to facilitate compliance,
even when formally hard law sanctions were available.38 The Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer created a variety of
sticks and carrots to realign incent ives, including potential trade
sanctions and a Multilateral Fund for Implementation for developing
countries. In contrast, the world has been completely unsuccessful in
addressing climate change mitigation, which is a much more complex and
difficult issue that is more susceptible to free riding, undermining
collective action. Human-induced climate change is happening and it is
not clear what, if anything, effectively will be done to reduce
emissions.

These different public goods entail different problem types. That of
weakest link public goods involves a holdout problem, whether the
holdout is an unwilling one, such as North Korea over nuclear weapons,
or an unable one, such as Somalia regarding polio eradication. That of
aggregate efforts public goods involves a free rider/collective action
problem, resulting in underinvestment in providing a solution. And that
of best shot public goods involves a positive externalities problem
because the investor does not fully capture the benefits. It is easier
to fund best shot public goods, even if the result is overinvestment
from the perspective of global efficiency. A technological alternative
to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for refrigerants, propellants, and
solvents (a best shot problem) appears to have resolved ozone layer
depletion by facilitating the phase-out of CFCs (an aggregate efforts
problem). Similarly, climate engineering (a best shot problem) has
become a default solution for addressing climate change because of the
difficulty of agreeing to emissions reductions (an aggregate efforts
problem).

There is a varying role for international law and international
institutions in producing these different global public goods. For best
shot global public goods, an international institution is not needed to
develop them. Private foundations could provide some of these goods,
such as through prizes for the development of new drugs to combat
tropical diseases. Yet where decisions over implementation can have
negative externalities, international legal obligations and institutions
that constrain unilateral action can better ensure fairness and manage
conflicts, and possibly produce public goods more efficiently, as in the
case of asteroid deflection and climate engineering. For aggregate
efforts public goods, in comparison, there is a greater need for
centralized institutions to produce them, leading to a relinquishment of
some national sovereignty. The opening quotation from Nordhaus reflects
his frustration with the global collective failure to address climate
change. In contrast, with weakest link public goods, the challenge
sometimes lies in building state sovereignty. The challenge for disease
eradication, for example, is with 'failed states' that lack functional
governing institutions. In other weakest-link situations involving
states unwilling to cooperate, such as that of nuclear proliferation,
there is greater need for an international institution such as the UN
Security Council, combined with financial transfers to secure nuclear
materials. Otherwise, pressure for unilateral action will increase.

In sum, international law and organizations play varying roles in the
production and governance of global public goods. Table 1 summarizes the
relationship of different types of global public goods with
international law and organizations in a legal pluralist world. 4

The Challenge of Distributive Conflict and the Production of Global
Public Goods

International law, like all law, has distributive consequences, posing
particular challenges for governing the production of global public
goods. These distributive issues cannot be elided, although they often
are in legal scholarship. At least three distributive issues arise in
decisions over the provision of global public goods: the specific terms
of cooperation for producing a global public good; choices among
producing different global public goods in a world of limited resources;
and the potential of actual conflict in the pursuit of different public
goods which can act at cross-purposes to each other.

It is striking that many of the international legal scholars who
incorporate ra tional international relations theory to explain
international cooperation have drawn on the familiar Prisoner's Dilemma
(PD) situation from game theory.40 The Prisoner's Dilemma game, however,
elides distributive issues. In the classic PD model, states are assumed
to have a defined set of preferences and a common interest in reaching a
cooperative outcome, and the primary impediment to be overcome is the
fear that other states will cheat on their agreements. In PD models,
mechanisms for the monitoring of state behaviour and the sanctioning of
states that violate the terms of the agreement can be created to address
these concerns. International law thus comes to the rescue to facilitate
mutually beneficial outcomes. Since concerns over cheating, shirking,
and slacking inhibit the production of global public goods through
international cooperation, the PD model may seem appropriate.

However, the Prisoner's Dilemma game ignores another important obstacle
to successful cooperation, namely conflicts among states with different
interests over the distribution of the costs and benefits of
cooperation.41 When states cooperate in international politics, they do
not simply choose between 'cooperation' and 'defection', the binary
choices available in PD games. They rather choose among specific terms
of cooperation, which raise distributive issues.42 Different states and
constituencies within them can have competing preferences for different
international rules and standards. States, and especially powerful
states, thus jockey to employ different forms of international law in a
world of fragmented institutions in an effort to influence the
development, meaning, and impact of international law.43

Secondly, different states and private actors benefit from the
production of some global public goods more than others. Since resources
are limited, they face opportunity costs when they make choices
regarding the production of public goods. They must determine not only
which public goods to fund, but also how much to fund each of them.44
Distributive concerns arise in choice and budgeting decisions, given
states' and private actors' conflicting views.

Thirdly, the pursuit of different public goods can conflict in a more
direct sense. One public good may interfere with the pursuit of another.
For example, choices over the generation of at least four public goods
arise in the debate over the interaction of public health,
pharmaceutical patent protection, human rights, and trade policy:
knowledge-generation, liberalized trade, public health, and the right to
life and human dignity.45 Knowledge has public-good attributes since
once knowledge enters the public domain it is no longer excludable and
our consumption does not diminish its availability.46 The central issue
is how to generate knowledge that facilitates new inventions and
understandings most effectively and equitably. International trade law
similarly has public good attributes, since all countries benefit not
only from the wider variety of products made available at lower prices
that trade liberalization facilitates, but also because they benefit
from rules constraining mutually harmful beggar-thy-neighbour
policies.47 Public health constitutes a third implicated public good
since we all benefit from the global eradication of diseases and we do
not diminish that good when we benefit from it.48 The right to life and
human dignity can be viewed as yet another affected public good to the
extent that it affects our moral sensibilities.49

The production of these public goods, however, can conflict,
complicating global decision-making over the terms of international law.
The recognition and enforcement of patent rights under the WTO Agreement
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs
Agreement) and other conventions can generate incentives for the
production of knowledge and new drugs for the protection of human life.
But the protection of pharmaceutical patent rights also can diminish the
benefits of liberalized trade by reducing the consumption possibilities
of citizens, interfere with the provision of public health policies in
containing diseases, and raise human rights concerns, as the AIDS
epidemic illustrates. Moreover, mandatory vaccination policies to
protect public health raise human rights concerns, especially from a
libertarian perspective, and in particular given uncertainty regarding
the consequences of vaccinations.

In sum, choices over global governance policies involve different
values, priorities, and perspectives, considerable uncertainty, and
rival public goods. As a result, although the definition of a single
global public good is one that is non-rivalrous, global public goods are
collectively rivalrous because choices must be made among them,
including in funding their production. Decisions over producing global
public goods thus raise the question of alternative institutional
choices in light of trade-offs.

5 Alternative Institutional Choices for the Production of Global Public
Goods: Global Constitutional, Administrative Law, and Legal Pluralist
Approaches

For the efficient production of pure private goods we rely on
(imperfect) preference revelation through the market. For the efficient
production of pure public goods we rely on (imperfect) preference
revelation through democratic voting. The conventional (although not
sole) solution is thus to rely on the state for the production of public
goods.50 State decisions, in turn, are constrained by constitutionally
provided checks and balances involving different state institutions,
including democratically elected legislatures and courts which exercise
judicial review of legislative and executive decisions. For the
production of global public goods, the institutional analogues are
international organizations. Since centralizing decision-making within
them raises serious legitimacy concerns, institutional choice poses the
ultimate question for the production of global public goods.

Although economists and law and economic scholars tend to address the
production of global public goods in terms of substantive effectiveness,
and thus start with an assumption of what is to be measured, we first
need agreement over the goal. Priorities and goals are determined
through institutional processes. Where choices among institutions affect
opportunities to participate, institutional analysis is needed to focus
on the relative biases of participation in alternative decision-making
processes that may define priorities and goals.

Problems of biased participation beset all institutional alternatives on
account of informational and resource asymmetries and divergent
incentives to participate because of varying per capita stakes in
outcomes. A major challenge in relying on national institutions is that
they make decisions which affect outsiders who are not represented
before them. In the case of many global public goods, moreover, reliance
on national decision-making raises collective action problems and free
rider concerns which undercut each nation's ability to attain its goals.
International institutions can help to overcome collective action
problems, as well as to reduce bias in participation in national
decision-making. However, the major challenge with international
institutions is their remoteness from affected constituencies and local
contexts, raising legitimacy concerns when decision-making has
distributive implications.

A key issue from a public policy perspective is thus the assessment of
the relative merits of institutional processes, and different
combinations of them, in terms of the relatively unbiased participation
of affected parties compared with other (non-idealized) institutional
alternatives.51 That is, who decides regarding the production of global
public goods? Or, put differently, which institutional process, among
alternative political, market, and judicial processes at the national,
local, regional, and international levels, should be granted how much
authority to decide on the appropriate balancing of different goals in
light of their distributive implications? These institutional choices
affect how different interests, directly and indirectly, are taken into
account. Such an approach is decidedly pragmatist. It recognizes that
there is no single best approach to producing global public goods, but
rather alternative approaches that involve trade-offs which vary in
light of particular global public goods problems, and from which we can
learn through practice.

In current international law scholarship, three analytic frameworks
compete for addressing the challenges of global governance, and thus
implicitly of the production of global public goods: constitutionalism,
global administrative law, and legal pluralism. These frameworks are
sometimes put forward as alternatives that better address global
governance challenges; yet, for our purposes, they are better viewed as
complements that apply differentially to the types of global public
goods we have discussed. These frameworks each have attributes and
deficiencies that make them more suitable frameworks for some issues
compared to others.

A The Global Constitutional Approach

Global constitutionalism is one of legal pluralism's chief rivals as a
contemporary vision for organizing, constraining, and legitimizing
international law.52 The constitutional vision of international law
comes in different varieties, but, relative to the pluralist vision, one
of its major attributes is its framing international law and
international institutions in constitutional terms that involves
centralized international institutions,53 often involving some form of
majoritarian or supra-majoritarian decision-making. The global
constitutional vision is suitable, in particular, for addressing the
production of aggregate efforts global public goods. Centralized
institutions operating under international law help to align national
incentives and to overcome free rider problems facing the production of
aggregate efforts global public goods.

For example, **[if climate change stabilization is to occur, centralized
rules and institutions to oversee their application will be required,
as]{.underline}** occurred successfully **[in the case of the protection
of the ozone layer]{.underline}**. Under the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, amendments to emissions limits
can be made by a two-thirds vote of the parties representing at least
half of the total consumption of the parties of controlled
ozone-depleting substances, if there is no consensus.54 Analogous voting
arrangements will need to be developed for the international regulation
of climate change mitigation that take account of those most implicated.

**[[For]{.mark} global public goods [challenges that pose imminent
threats]{.mark}, existing]{.underline}** UN
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and in particular the UN
Security Council, **[[will need to be reformed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and updated. The issue of UN reform was considered in the 1990s and
2000s, but remains needed to reflect today's global context.55 **[Issues

could even be considered within a reformed Security Council where they
**[[pose international]{.mark} security [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Centralized institutions]{.underline}** and regulations **[have

Finally, as we have seen, even the production of best shot global public
goods raises distributive concerns that centralized governance can help
to address. **[Centralized institutions]{.underline}**, operating under
a constitutional frame of checks and balances, **[can help to keep
national decision-makers accountable]{.underline}**. We have seen these
issues raised **[in decision-making over geo-engineering and asteroid
deflection for national defence.]{.underline}**

As globalization and technological advance increase the need for
centralized international decision-making, a constitutional frame will
become of growing importance for critically scrutinizing and checking
these institutions' exercise of power. Nonetheless, although the global
constitutional vision has certain attributes regarding the governance of
centralized institutions needed to provide global public goods, these
institutions face major legitimacy challenges. The production by
national institutions of public goods is beset by trade-offs, ranging
from bureaucratic inefficiencies to political corruption. A vastly
greater challenge at the global level is the lack of democratic
processes that reveal preferences, reflecting the lack of a global
demos.56 To the extent that we rely on states to represent citizens'
interests, moreover, many states are not democratic.57 States vary
considerably in terms of population, so that decision-making arguably
should take into account differences in the size of states (as opposed
to generally relying on consensus voting at the international level).
Since international institutions are so distant from citizens that it is
difficult to conceive of democratic global institutions, we will need to
re-conceive or otherwise adapt our concept of democratic checks and
balances to the international level,58 and rely on other forms of
accountability mechanisms. Curiously, the existing literature on global
constitutionalism has been largely silent on the issue of global public
goods.59

B The Global Legal Pluralist Approach

Although the concept of global public goods poses challenges for the
legal pluralist vision and its focus on decentralized processes, this
approach remains extremely relevant. Among legal pluralism's virtues is
that pluralism accounts better for divergences in community values,
priorities, and perspectives in light of the distributive consequences
at stake in the production of global public goods. Enumerating and
deliberating over these distributive issues highlights the need for
pluralism to contest centralized policies.

The legal pluralist vision calls to the forefront the importance of
ongoing interaction with state institutions in order for
global-public-goods governance to be accountable and effective. From an
accountability perspective, the pluralist approach provides a needed
check on centralized decision-making at the global level, such as for
the production of aggregate efforts public goods. From the perspective
of effectiveness, international law is more likely to be implemented if
it engages and takes account of state perceptions and concerns through
pluralist interaction.

Legal pluralists focus on the potential pathologies of centralized
institutions and the role of pluralism in checking these pathologies.
Krisch shows how, in our current socio-political context, the
interaction of pluralist legal orders can produce superior ordering to a
constitutionalism that is based on hierarchic, centralized
decision-making, since mutual accommodation that can result from
pluralist interaction will be grounded in greater legitimacy.60 Krisch
illustrates, for example, how the UN Security Council reassessed and
revised its procedures regarding the freezing of individuals' assets in
the 'war on terror' in light of due process concerns, only after states
and other actors challenged and resisted implementation of its
resolutions.61

Delmas-Marty demonstrates how pluralism can also lead to a unification
of legal norms based on a 'hybrid' melding of different 'ensembles' of
law, rather than on hegemony.62 Such a pluralist hybrid is more
legitimate, in that it takes into account, and borrows from, different
national legal systems. Because it is more legitimate, it is more likely
to be implemented in practice by states.

Ultimately, international law depends on national implementation.
Concerns over implementation are particularly salient regarding weakest
link public goods. If an infectious disease is to be eradicated, for
example, then capacity must be built in a weakest link state. Otherwise,
centralized decision-making will be ineffective. Weakest link global
public goods highlight the need for pluralist interaction with states
having meaningful capacity to engage with policies, such as disease
eradication. Take, for example, the distribution of antiretroviral drugs
to combat the AIDS crisis. Their effective use for constraining the
epidemic's ravages are enhanced where developing countries have the
capacity to provide meaningful input to tailor policies and to carry out
such tailored programmes effectively.

C The Global Administrative Law Approach

The global administrative law approach helps to address the deficiencies
of the global constitutional vision through providing other
accountability mechanisms, derived from national administrative law,
which can be used to check centralized international decision-making.63
As national governments grew during the twentieth century in response to
the growing complexity of national public goods challenges, legislatures
delegated increasing powers to agencies. States correspondingly
developed administrative law accountability mechanisms to apply to
agencies, given that legislatures were unable to oversee them
sufficiently. International institutions can be viewed analogously to
national government agencies, in that both involve a delegation of power
to an unelected body.

The accountability mechanisms highlighted by the global administrative
law pro ject are pragmatically useful for governing the production of
global public goods. They include transparency and access to
information; engagement with civil society and with national
parliaments; monitoring, inspection, reporting, and notice and comment
procedures; reason-giving requirements; substantive standards, such as
proportionality, that must be met; and judicial review.64 These
accountability mechanisms can be developed through international
treaties, such as under the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information,
Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in
Environmental Matters,65 and through national and international judicial
decisions. Decision-making within international institutions must be
overseen, in particular, through private groups placing pressure on
public representatives. Making international decision-making more
transparent facilitates such processes.

To give one example of the usefulness of the global administrative law
framework in the context of global public health, the WHO is
increasingly engaging in public--private partnerships for innovative
drug development because of the challenges of obtaining sufficient
public financing.66 These partnerships raise conflicts-of-interest
concerns that a global administrative law model can help to address
through transparency and other administrative law mechanisms.

The global administrative law model also offers the advantage of being
applicable to national decision-making over the production of global
public goods, thus providing checks on decentralization under a legal
pluralist model. As we have seen, the deployment of best shot global
public goods, such as technologies for asteroid deflection and climate
engineering, may not require an international institution. Yet, the
externalities involved in their deployment by states calls for
accountability checks. Such national decision-making can be subject to
due process requirements and to monitoring and review before
international administrative bodies and courts. The WTO Shrimp--Turtle
case provides an excellent example. The US exercised unilateral action
to help preserve an endangered species on the high seas (a global public
good). Its efforts, however, had significant implications for developing
countries and their traders. The WTO Appellate Body successfully pressed
the US to change its administrative law procedures better to assure due
process review of the situations and concerns of these countries and
their traders.67

Nonetheless, despite its many attributes, the global administrative law
approach is rather technocratic and thus lacks ambition regarding larger
scale questions of governance requiring political decision-making for
the production of global public goods.

Each of these three leading analytic frameworks for assessing law's role
in global governance focuses in a different way on the issues of
accountability and legitimacy. Their relative attributes can be assessed
in relation to different global public goods. For the production of
aggregate efforts public goods where more centralization is needed, the
legal pluralist vision is particularly insufficient. The global
constitutionalist perspective, which legal pluralists have criticized,
offers a complementary frame for building and critically scrutinizing
centralized international institutions to which important secondary
rule-making powers are delegated in light of imminent global public
goods challenges, such as over international security and climate
change. The global administrative law project has been particularly
important in providing practical tools drawn from domestic
administrative law for enhancing the accountability of decision-making
in the production of global public goods, whether at the international
or at the national level. The case of best shot public goods, for
example, illustrates concerns regarding decision-making at the national
level. Finally, the challenges of weakest link public goods highlight
the need for ongoing interaction between centralized entities and nation
states if international law and policy are to be implemented
effectively. Each approach, in short, has attributes and deficiencies,
involving trade-offs and potential complementarities. They should be
viewed in comparative institutional analytic terms in relation to
different global public goods challenges. Table 2 summarizes our
discussion.68

Although these analytic approaches are sometimes advanced as
alternatives, they play important complementary roles for enhancing the
legitimacy of the international institutions that we need to produce
different types of global public goods.

International Law as Facilitator of, and Potential Constraint on, the
Production of Global Public Goods

Law (in general) and international law (in particular) can be viewed as
a public good in providing for order and stability.69 Law (in general)
and **[[international law]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in particular) also
**[can be viewed as an intermediate public good that
[facilitates]{.mark} the production of final substantive [public
goods]{.mark} -- such as the [avoidance of ozone depletion]{.mark}, the
provision of [a stable climate]{.mark} through mitigation and
geoengineering, financial stability, [and peace between
nations.]{.mark}]{.underline}**[70
**[I]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nternational [law]{.mark} and
institutions]{.underline}** help to **[[overcome collective action and
free rider problems]{.mark}. They facilitate interaction that can
produce shared understandings and common purposes. [And]{.mark}
they]{.underline}** help to **[[manage the frictions between]{.mark}
pluralist [legal orders]{.mark} that govern different public
goods]{.underline}**. In this way, international law helps to provide
for public order.

However, international law, in its prescriptive and proscriptive forms,
can also constrain the production of global public goods. It may do so
by creating positive or negative obligations that interfere with their
production. Some contend, for example, that the positive obligations
under the WTO TRIPs Agreement and other international intellectual
property conventions reduce the supply of knowledge and constrain the
protection of public health.71 Others contend that the negative
obligations provided in other WTO agreements could constrain needed
national action on climate change, such as through carbon taxes, an
emissions-trading system, or a product 'life cycle' labelling regime.72
To the extent that decisions under the Convention on Biodiversity limit
research on geoengineering, they too are suspect.73

Unilateral action is problematic because it can be self-serving and fail
to take account of the values and perspectives of affected others. Yet
unilateral action may also be an important part of a broader
transnational process leading to the production of a global public good
over time. In a world of interacting legal orders, certain actors will
have to act, sometimes unilaterally, to catalyse international and
global action. These actors most likely will exercise some form of
power, such as market power wielded by the US and EU. To advance climate
change policies globally, the US or EU may need to take unilateral
action by creating its own internal system and then imposing some form
of a border tax adjustment or penalty applied to applicable imports and
cross-border services from countries that do not have a remediation
system of comparable effectiveness.74 In a world without centralization
and hierarchy, there will often be a need for unilateral action to spur
the production of global public goods by inciting reactions and
interactions which lead to the emergence of international law and
international institutions to govern conflicts and maintain order. In
practice, unilateralism may help to produce a global public good where
common action fails, especially in light of opt-in rules under
international treaties. Although international law can help to produce
global public goods, it also can get in the way of their production.

The possibility of unilateral action is not available to all, and the
results often reflect biases. For example, John Yoo has written of
global security as a public good which is not provided by global
institutions in order to justify US intervention in Iraq and other
unilateral policies.75 The example of Iraq makes clear the need for some
form of international constraint on unilateral action so that a nation
must justify its acts and take into account their impact on others. The
WTO provides such a possibility in the area of regulation. It creates
constraints and has a mandatory dispute settlement system to hear legal
complaints, backed by sanctions. Its dispute settlement system can press
a country to negotiate in good faith with third countries and create
internal administrative law mechanisms in which non-citizens' interests
are heard. These constraints are less binding in other areas, such as
international security, as represented by the US invasion of Iraq,
NATO's intervention in Kosovo, and US missile and drone attacks in the
territories of other states.

In sum, international law represents an important 'constraint on the
unilateral definition of a global public good'.76 The stringency of this
constraint, however, should vary in light of the objective at stake, the
effectiveness of a multilateral alternative, and the possibility that
the national measure can take better account of its implications on
outsiders in an unbiased manner. There are thus compelling reasons to
refocus attention from public international law to processes of
transnational legal ordering in which international law is one element
in a broader interactive process.

Conclusion

**[Globalization pressures transform issues that formerly were national
in scope into global ones. With globalization, national decision-making
increasingly has externalities on outsiders, and it is increasingly
insufficient to attain national goals. International law and
institutions thus rise in importance]{.underline}**. Choices over the
terms of international law, however, have distributive consequences, and
the choice among global public goods and their funding involves rivalry.
As a result, the key normative question becomes a comparative
institutional one: that is, under what conditions are more or less
centralization and hierarchy preferable? While the choice among
alternatives may be complicated at the national level, the choice
becomes much more so at the international level where problems of
numbers and complexity multiply.

The global public goods framework helps us to see both the attributes
and limits of a legal pluralist approach toward international law and
institutions. Legal pluralism's starting assumption is about the need
for communities to have a voice in shaping their own destinies. It thus
distrusts order imposed by hierarchical, centralized institutional
authority. The starting assumption for the production of many global
public goods, in contrast, is the need for collective action to
cooperate for common benefits. These starting points create a tension.
There are risks of too much comfort with the legal pluralist framework
as an organizing concept for the production of global public goods. But
there are parallel risks with legitimizing centralized international
decision-making without global democratic checks. Comparative
institutional analysis is thus required which is tailored to the
particular challenges raised by the production of different global
public goods. **[[I]{.mark}nternational [law will play a critical
role]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[by facilitating the creation,
maintenance, oversight, and constraint of centralized international
institutions, and the monitoring and review of national institutions, in
relation to decision-making implicating the production of global public
goods]{.underline}** in different contexts. Given the varying contexts
of different global public goods, there is no single best, universalist
approach. Rather, a pragmatic approach is required in relation to
different types of public goods and real world institutional limits.
These strategies must include greater international centralization (for
which constitutional principles are needed), multi-level institutional
interaction (highlighting the key role of pluralism), and hybrids that
include public--private partnerships (for which administrative law
principles are required).

While socioeconomic conditions rarely trigger violent conflict on their
own, [**[violations of]{.mark} personal integrity** or security
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline}---including indiscriminate killings,
systematic torture, disappearances, or wide-scale imprisonment do
[[provide a]{.mark} **clear [link to
escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.81 An [authoritative
statement]{.underline} on this count [comes from sociologist Jeff
Goodwin]{.underline}, whose study of 20th century revolu tions [argues
that **[politics matter more than]{.mark}
[economics]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

> \[Revolutionary movements were more consistently a response to
> severely con stricted or even contracting political opportunities,
> including chronic and even increasing state repression. [Ordinary
> [people joined]{.mark}]{.underline} or [supported revolutionary
> [movements when no other means]{.mark} of political expression [were
> available]{.mark} to them]{.underline}, or when they or their families
> and friends were the targets of violent repression that was
> perpetrated or tolerated by relatively weak states.82

[State [repression]{.mark}]{.underline} is a major risk factor because
it [[can transform]{.mark} latent [grievances into active antagonisms,
providing]{.mark} the persecuted with **strong [motivations for
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although individuals and groups may
grudgingly tolerate economic inequality and discrimination for years,
they are more likely to respond with violence when physically threatened
or attacked. [This response is especially likely when repression is
indiscriminate, since quiescence offers little protection]{.underline}.
**[[Importantly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, there [is strong evidence that
government **[repression is habit-forming]{.mark}** and that **past
levels** of repression have a powerful **effect** on **current
behavior**]{.underline}. Like civil war, [government [repression seems
to have a life of its own]{.mark}, re-emerging time and
again]{.underline}.83

Governments are not the only ones capable of violating personal in
tegrity rights. Non-state groups may also make extreme demands or use
violence, thereby inviting government repression and conflict
escalation.84 As governments go after real and imagined opponents, fear
and anger spread, facilitating further mobilization.85 Importantly, [one
study presents statistical evidence in support of the argument that
states will switch from accommodation to repression,]{.underline} or
vice versa, [when either tactic meets with further]{.underline}
rebellion or [dissent]{.underline}. Thus, the choices dissidents make
can profoundly shape government behavior.86 When both sides resort to
violence, the proverbial vicious cycle often ensues.

[To illustrate the **repression-conflict nexus**, this article makes use
of the **Political Terror Scale** (**PTS**), a five-point index that
ranks governments\' re sort to state terro]{.underline}r.87 [Widely used
by social scientists]{.underline},88 [PTS scores measure state\'s
propensity to violate its citizens\' personal integrity rights, draw ing
on]{.underline} narrative [reports by either Amnesty International or
the US State Department.]{.underline}89 These scores range from one,
where state terror is \"rare,\" to five, where state terror is
\"systematic.\" Graph 4 divides most of the world\'s countries into five
groups according to their average PTS scores (based on Amnesty
International reports) for the period of 1990 to 2003 and indicates the
number of countries in each group that experienced at least one year of
internal conflict or war during that period.90

[The graph suggests that the [association between **state repression**

Amend the AECA to Require Congressional Approval for All Arms
Sales---Finally, **[[we recommend]{.mark} that the [AECA]{.mark} be
amended to [require congressional approval for all arms
sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The [current law]{.mark} is designed to
[make]{.mark} arms [sales easy by making it difficult]{.mark} for
Congress [to block them]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Blocking a sale requires
a majority vote in both houses of Congress, with such votes typically
cropping up inconveniently in the middle of other, more-pressing issues
on the legislative agenda. **[[Congress has]{.mark} exerted [little or
no influence]{.mark} over arms sales [and has allowed]{.mark} the
[executive branch near-complete autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Requiring a congressional vote to approve]{.mark} arms
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[[would
subject]{.mark} arms [deals to]{.mark} much [more]{.mark} intense
[scrutiny]{.mark} than has traditionally been the case]{.underline}**,
and **[[blocking misguided]{.mark} arms [sales would be]{.mark} much
[easier]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Requiring]{.mark} a
[separate]{.mark} piece of [legislation to approve each]{.mark} arms
[deal]{.mark}, not simply requiring a resolution against, [would
encourage deliberations about the strategic benefits]{.mark} of any
proposed deal.]{.underline}**

**[CONCLUSION]{.underline}**

Selling major conventional weapons is a risky business, especially to
nations where conditions are ripe for bad outcomes. **[[After decades
of]{.mark} [selling]{.mark} weapons [to almost any nation]{.mark} that
asks, enough [evidence]{.mark} has accumulated to [make it clear]{.mark}
that [the costs outweigh the benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Policy
change is long overdue.

**[Unfortunately, Donald Trump has embraced the conventional wisdom. [In
addition to the]{.mark} massive [\$110 billion deal with Saudi Arabia,
Trump has seized]{.mark} on the [tensions with North Korea to encourage
Japan]{.mark} and other Asian allies [to buy more]{.mark} American
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[For Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the **[rationale was]{.underline}** simple: **[["It's a lot of jobs for
us and]{.mark} a []{.mark}lot of [safety for
Japan."]{.mark}]{.underline}**101As we have argued here, **this
conventional wisdom is misguided**. **[Instead of turning first to [arms
sales]{.mark}, which [are likely to inflame tensions in hot spots like
the Pacific Rim or the Middle East]{.mark}, the United States should
rely more heavily on diplomacy]{.underline}**. **[[The]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [does not need the limited economic
benefits arms sales provide]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} it certainly does not
need [the strategic headaches]{.mark} that come with
them]{.underline}**.

weapons sales had to be expedited without time for congressional
oversight.

**[[\"For whatever reason, the administration --- in what seems to me a
not fully baked decision-making process --- decided to circumvent the
law, decided to circumvent the constitutional responsibility of Congress
and act unilaterally,\"]{.mark} said Republican [Sen. Ted Cruz]{.mark}
of Texas.]{.underline}**

Cruz added: \"And don\'t make the mistake of thinking that it is simply
Democrats who are concerned about this.\"

**[If the administration attempted to bypass Congress again, Cruz said
he would oppose the move and predicted other Republicans would as
well.]{.underline}**

**[[Several Republicans have joined Democrats in supporting bills
disapproving of the arms sales,]{.mark} but President Donald Trump has
promised to veto the measures. Opponents would need to secure more
Republican votes to overturn a Trump veto.]{.underline}**

Congress usually has 30 days to review all arms sales. But **[on May 28,
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo invoked a rarely used provision in arms
control law to bypass Congress and declare an emergency to expedite the
weapons deals, which he said were justified due to the threat posed by
Iran.]{.underline}**

Although the administration portrayed the arms sales as a matter of
urgency to help Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan
counter Iran, Cooper acknowledged after repeated questioning that the
military hardware had yet to be delivered 47 days later.

**[Under questioning by Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey,
Cooper also acknowledged that many of the necessary contracts between
the U.S. and the Arab governments buying the weapons had not been
wrapped up.]{.underline}**

\"What\'s the sense of the emergency?\" asked Menendez.

The Democrat accused Cooper and the State Department of failing to treat
Congress as a co-equal branch of government as enshrined in law.
Menendez said that \"since you began your tenure, the \[State\]
Department has shown only disdain for Congress and the laws that govern
our arms export programs.

**[Cooper defended the fast-tracked arms sales, saying it was a
\"one-time event.\" He said intelligence had indicated a growing threat
from Iran and that events since the May 28 announcement had confirmed
the danger, including the downing of an unmanned American surveillance
aircraft by Iranian forces.]{.underline}**

He also said Washington needed to ensure it was a reliable supplier of
arms to its allies. Otherwise, Cooper said, U.S. adversaries such as
Russia or China could usurp the U.S. as a security partner.

\"In such an environment it is crucial that the United States remain the
partner of choice and be trusted as a dependable provider of defense
capabilities --- including materiel --- to our partners,\" Cooper said.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said that **[[lawmakers on both sides of the
aisle would not allow congressional oversight to be undercut and are
prepared to vote to scale back the president\'s power to declare an
emergency for arms packages.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[If the administration fails to consult Congress, \"I suspect this
body will act and restrict or remove that ability for future emergency
waivers altogether,\" Coons said.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[The Senate Foreign Relations Committee]{.mark} recently [backed a
bill sponsored by Menendez and other lawmakers that would restrict the
president\'s authority to invoke an emergency to skip congressional
approval for arms deals.]{.mark} Under the bill, an emergency waiver
could only be used for top-tier security treaty allies, including NATO
countries, Australia, Israel, Japan, South Korea and New
Zealand.]{.underline}**

[Presidential [power over]{.mark} a party or [Congress comes
from]{.mark} enough [lawmakers needing, fearing or]{.mark} genuinely
[liking them. Donald Trump has none]{.mark} of this.]{.underline}

Almost four months into office, [Trump has been [unable to gain
leverage]{.mark} over his party]{.underline}, especially in the Senate,
much less Congress as a whole.

[Senate [Republicans don\'t need him]{.mark}]{.underline}. They\'re
pressing ahead with their investigations into Russian interference in
the election and pushing sanctions against Vladimir Putin. [They\'re
pushing their own health care bill on their own timetable [and hardly
rushing to Trump\'s defense]{.mark}.]{.underline} With a very favorable
set of 2018 races, it\'s hard to see a need materializing.[I\'m told
Senate Republicans will also go their own way on tax reform,
unconstrained by White House policy priorities or
timetable.]{.underline}

[[Most]{.mark} Republicans [don\'t like him]{.mark}.]{.underline}
President Obama used a mix of need and genuine affection to jam through
Obamacare in his first two years. There are very few Trump Republicans,
much less lawmakers who dig their president. [[They tolerate him]{.mark}
and they often vote with him, [because Trump has]{.mark} largely
[embraced conventional GOP ideas]{.mark}. But most think he\'s blowing
it.]{.underline}

[[No one fears him.]{.underline}]{.mark} Not long ago, Republicans
worried about a Trump tweet fired their way. No more. And
[[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} certainly [don\'t fear a president opposed
by]{.mark} most [Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, as Axios\'
Jonathan Swan reported in his weekly Sneak Peek newsletter last night,
[[they\'re ready to effectively shut down]{.underline}]{.mark} the
Senate to force a special prosecutor for the Russia probe.

### IL\-\--A2: No Risky Sales

#### Arms sales are [extremely dangerous]{.underline} now -- CATO index proves

Mason University), former director of the University of

Sales," CATO Institute, initially published in *War on the Rocks*, 6/13,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/new-framework-assessing-risks-us-arms-sales

Three critical observations emerge from this exercise. First, **[[there
are a lot of risky customers]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}**, **[and
[the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[sells weapons to most]{.mark} of
them]{.underline}**. **[Thirty-seven nations]{.underline}** (21.8
percent) **[scored in the highest risk category on at least two metrics
and 77]{.underline}** (45.3 percent) **[were in the highest risk
category on at least one of the]{.underline}** five
**[measures]{.underline}**. **[There are]{.underline}** simply **[not
many safe bets]{.underline}** **[when it comes to the arms
trade]{.underline}**.

Second, as simple as it is, **[[our risk index does correlate with
negative consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The five countries
([Libya, Iraq, Yemen, the]{.mark} Democratic Republic of [Congo, and
Sudan]{.mark}) that [scored as high-risk on all five measures]{.mark}
are]{.underline}** places **[where]{.underline}** the **[negative
consequences have been worst. American [weapons have
been]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[stolen]{.underline}**,
**[misused]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[used against
American interests]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in]{.underline}**
**[each]{.underline}** **[of these places since 2002. [The very risky
category]{.mark} also [illustrates the full range of unintended]{.mark}
[consequences]{.mark} from arms sales. [Afghanistan, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Somalia, and Ukraine fall into this
category]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Finally, the [**[analysis provides compelling evidence]{.underline}**
**[that]{.underline}** **[despite]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [warning
flags]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[does not discriminate]{.mark} between high- and low-risk
[customers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [**[average sales to the riskiest
nations are]{.underline}** **[higher]{.underline}**
**[than]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[those [to the least risky]{.mark}
nations]{.underline}**. The **[24 [countries]{.mark} labeled
"[highest]{.mark} risk" [on the Global Terrorism
Index]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example,
**[[bought]{.underline}]{.mark}** an average of **[[\$2.2
billion]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[worth [of]{.mark} American
[weapons]{.mark} during the time period]{.underline}** we analyzed. The
[**[31 countries in]{.underline}** **[active, high-level
conflicts]{.underline}** **[bought]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[an average
of [\$3.1 billion]{.mark}. This strongly suggests]{.underline}** **[that
the most [obvious risk factors play]{.mark} little or [no role]{.mark}
at all [in limiting]{.mark} U.S. arms [sales.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Applying the risk assessment framework to]{.underline}** the list of
**[[embargoed nations]{.mark} only [sharpens this
point]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The 16]{.underline}** nations currently
**[banned]{.underline}** from buying American weapons **[had an average
score of 11.6. [Many]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the nations on the list
are adversaries (Iran, North Korea) but others, like Sudan and Eritrea,
[**[were only banned after]{.underline}**
**[egregious]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[levels of [insurgency,
terror]{.mark}ism, and human [rights abuses]{.mark} emerged. Although it
is a sign of progress that these countries were eventually placed on an
embargo list, the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[still sold weapons to them]{.underline}**
**[when most of the risks were already apparent.]{.underline}**
**[Moreover, Am[erica's current customer list includes 32
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[like Egypt, Nigeria, and Pakistan,
[with]{.mark} a [risk]{.mark} index score [above]{.mark} the average of
[those who are banned]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

### IL\-\--A2: SQ Solves

#### Current approach of disapproval [fails]{.underline} -- Congress is unable to override Presidential arms sales when they've been invested, and the current structure causes them to lack concern in other cases -- the status quo causes [extremely risky]{.underline} arms sales

https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/new-framework-assessing-risks-us-arms-sales

**[In the past two years, [Congress has]{.mark} tried (and [failed)
twice to halt]{.mark} American [arms sales]{.mark} to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** in response to that country's intervention in
Yemen's civil war. **[This level of [concern is historically
unusual]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Arms sales]{.underline}**
**[rarely]{.underline}** **[spur]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[much
[debate]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Washington, **[where [they are viewed
as]{.mark} a [critical]{.mark} tool]{.underline}** **[of American
foreign policy. The traditional refrain]{.underline}** **[holds that
arms sales promise leverage]{.underline}** over recipient countries,
**[help the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[support allies]{.underline}** and **[manage
regional balances]{.underline}** of power, **[and generate economic
benefits]{.underline}** to boot. With some exceptions,
**[[few]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[have
[challenged]{.mark}]{.underline}** the wisdom of **[American [arms
sales]{.mark} practices]{.underline}**.

In a recent study for the Cato Institute, however, **[[we
argue]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[the government's approach]{.mark}
to arms sales [is misguided]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[accepts]{.mark} as
given]{.underline}** the **[potential [benefits]{.mark} of selling
weapons]{.underline}** [**[while underestimating]{.underline}**
**[or]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[simply [ignoring]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[the potential [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[The result has
been]{.underline}** **[too many arms sales]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** **[too many countries]{.underline}**
**[where]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [risks]{.mark} are likely to
[outweigh]{.mark} the benefits]{.underline}**. **[Between 2002 and 2016,
[America delivered]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[\$197
billion]{.underline}**]{.mark} worth of major conventional weapons,
equipment, and training through its Foreign Military Sales program
**[[to 167 states]{.mark} worldwide. [It is difficult to
imagine]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[what]{.mark} sort of [process would
rate so many]{.mark} of the world's roughly 200 countries [as
safe]{.mark} bets]{.underline}** to receive American weapons. Indeed,
**[[using a "risk index" we created]{.mark} to assess U.S. arms sales,
[we found]{.mark}]{.underline}** that in this time period,
**[[the]{.mark} average dollar [value of]{.mark} U.S. arms
[sales]{.mark} per nation [to the riskiest states]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[was higher]{.mark} [than]{.mark} to [the least risky]{.mark}
states]{.underline}**. **[Even [more disturbing]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[was our finding that [32]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the 167 recipients
**[[had risk]{.mark} index [scores]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[higherthan]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the average score of [the 16
nations]{.mark} currently [banned]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[from

**[[There are clear rules against arms transfers to third
parties]{.mark}. There are [also]{.mark} end-use monitoring requirements
for [U.S. arms exports, but these checks are hardly universal]{.mark}.
Given that at least some of the [equipment]{.mark} found [in militia

[o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense, [State Department, and Commerce Department
are clearly not adequately monitoring sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
(Which U.S. agency is responsible for end-use checks depends on the type
of sale conducted.)

**[[The United States is the largest arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and
the UAE]{.underline}]{.mark}**, two lucrative customers of the U.S.
defense industry. Saudi Arabia was the largest importer of U.S. arms,
having purchased \$112 billion in weapons from 2013 through 2017. The
UAE was the second-largest importer of U.S. arms in the same time span.
Since 2009, over \$27 billion in weapons have been offered to the UAE in
thirty-two separate deals under the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales
program.

**[[These arms sales continue, despite both countries' history of
diverting arms to favored militias]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia
has been purchasing weapons from third parties to pass on to allied
governments and groups at least since the 1970s, sometimes on behalf of
the U.S. government. **[[Transparency International's Government Defense
Anti-Corruption Index ranks Saudi Arabia and the UAE in its high-risk
category for corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with Saudi Arabia
receiving a score of zero out of four (zero being the worst) and the UAE
receiving a score of one for lacking a well-scrutinized process for arms
export decisions that aligns with international protocols.

**[The CNN investigation comes as [Congress]{.mark} ramps up its
[opposition to U.S. support for the Saudi-led

administration only reluctantly agreed to support the Saudi-led
coalition as it went on the offense in 2015, seeing it as an unwinnable
proxy war against Iran[. **[Obama had put restrictions on arms

cooperation]{.underline}** with the coalition in 2016, but **[President
Donald [Trump's admin]{.mark}istration [lifted those]{.mark}
restrictions]{.underline}** in March 2017, **[just prior to Trump's
overseas visit to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**.

**[Saudi [human rights abuses in Yemen using U.S.
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as the airstrike on a school bus in
August 2018 that killed forty children, and the murder of Khashoggi
**[have [shocked the U.S.]{.mark} public and Congress. In the National

coalition]{.mark} was doing all it [could]{.mark} to [prevent civilian
casualties; the State Department failed to provide that]{.mark}
justification]{.underline}** when it was due earlier this month. In
December, **[the [Senate approved a measure to end arms shipments to
Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, despite the Trump administration's strong
opposition to the bill. The measure did [not]{.mark} have [enough votes
to override a]{.mark} presidential [veto]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but
senators have promised to introduce an even tougher bill in 2019. Last
week**[, [the House also passed a measure to end U.S. assistance to the

necessary to counter Iran's regional "malign influence]{.underline}**."
But it's much more likely that **[[they will be deployed in the Yemen

civilians.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

A New York Times exposé last week shone a light on that aspect of the
Yemeni war, one that Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration would
likely prefer we ignore: **[[lethal airstrikes on hospitals]{.mark} and
other health care facilities [by the Saudi-Emirati-led
coalition]{.mark}, [using U.S. military armaments]{.mark} and ordnance
and [supported by U.S. training and intelligence]{.mark}. That report
highlighted an almost casual commission of war crimes -- [attacks on
medical facilities despite vivid markings]{.mark} on hospital roofs
identifying their medical purpose and the existence of a "no strike
list," which is an index of permanently deconflicted humanitarian sites
managed [by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian

This Article presents a strategic\--as opposed to ideological or
normative\--argument that **[the promotion of human rights should be
given a more prominent place in U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}**. It
does so by suggesting a correlation between the domestic human rights
practices of states and their propensity to engage in aggressive
international conduct. **[Among the chief threats to]{.underline}** U.S.
**[national security are acts of aggression by other
states]{.underline}**. Aggressive acts of war may directly endanger the
United States, as did the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, or
they may require U.S. military action overseas, as in Kuwait fifty years
later. **[[Evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the post-Cold War period
 \[\*250\]  **[[indicates]{.mark} that [states that]{.mark}

**[[global security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Since 1990, **[a state\'s
domestic human rights policy appears to be a telling indicator of that
state\'s propensity to engage in international
aggression]{.underline}**. A central element of U.S. foreign policy has
long been the preservation of peace and the prevention of such acts of
aggression.

If the correlation discussed herein is accurate, it provides U.S.
policymakers with a powerful new tool to enhance national security
through the promotion of human rights. A strategic linkage between
national security and human rights would result in a number of important
policy modifications. First, it changes the prioritization of those
countries U.S. policymakers have identified as presenting the greatest
concern. Second, it alters some of the policy prescriptions for such
states. Third, it offers states a means of signaling benign
international intent through the improvement of their domestic human
rights records. Fourth, it provides a way for a current government to
prevent future governments from aggressive international behavior
through the institutionalization of human rights protections. Fifth,
**[[it addresses the]{.underline}]{.mark}** particular **[[threat
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** human rights abusing **[[states
obtaining]{.underline}]{.mark}** weapons of mass destruction
(**[[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}**). Finally, it offers a mechanism for
U.S.-U.N. cooperation on human rights issues.

Instead of the wishful thinking of Secretary Kerry, who seems unable to
talk about Egypt without referring to an illusory "transition to
democracy," **[Sewall noted]{.underline}** the
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[security]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** **[political challenges]{.underline}**
**[fac]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ing [Egypt]{.mark}]{.underline}**. She
had the courage to make the case to her hosts that **[the [way to
meet]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[challenges]{.underline}** facing
Egyptian society **[[is]{.mark} through]{.underline}** tolerance,
inclusiveness, and **[respect for]{.underline}** **[universal human
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

She said frankly, "**[we are deeply concerned about]{.underline}** the
**[suppression]{.underline}** of civil liberties, **[including societal
and government restrictions]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** freedoms
of **[expression]{.underline}** and the **[press]{.underline}** and the
freedom of **[assembly]{.underline}** and
**[association]{.underline}**\... **[and academic
freedom]{.underline}**."

She also noted that human **[rights [violations]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[fuel]{.mark} the [grievances]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[on
which]{.underline}** **[terror]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ism and violent
extremism]{.underline}** **[[feed]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "**[When
people]{.underline}** **[are [torture]{.mark}d]{.underline}**, when
nonviolent protestors are shot and arrested, **[it [suggests]{.mark}
there is [no]{.mark}]{.underline}** peaceful **[[avenue to
express]{.underline}]{.mark}** sincere **[differences]{.underline}**.
**[That is how dissidents become terrorists]{.underline}**, how
democracies erode, how economies wither. **[These are]{.underline}** the
**[lessons of history]{.underline}** **[all nations bear in
mind]{.underline}**."

**[These are appropriately forthright words. They are]{.underline}**
also **[consistent]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** the
**[U.S.]{.underline}** government's **[theoretical]{.underline}** new
**[approach to]{.underline}** dealing with the threat of
**[terror]{.underline}**ism, **[the]{.underline}** countering violent
extremism (**[CVE]{.underline}**) initiative **[championed
by]{.underline}** President **[Obama]{.underline}** and other senior
administration officials over the last year.

The United States undermines the credibility of the comprehensive,
preventive approach to countering terrorism it is seeking to promote
when it fails to challenge its close allies with poor human rights
records, like Egypt, to put an end to their repression and human rights
violations, which are harmful to multilateral efforts to combat
terrorism.

For example, on February 9 in Washington, D.C., Egyptian Foreign
Minister Sameh Shoukry claimed that Egypt "continues to play a positive
and a productive role in the various efforts, international efforts,
underway to eradicate this terrorist threat." This is false. As Under
Secretary Sewall explained in Cairo, compromising universal values and
abusing the powers of the state undermines multilateral efforts to
combat terrorism. Secretary Kerry, who was standing next to Shoukry
while he made his remarks, offered no pushback and made no reference to
Egypt's human rights violations in his own remarks.

Furthermore, on the day that Under Secretary Sewall spoke in Cairo news
emerged that the Obama Administration removed human rights conditions
from its budget request to Congress for foreign assistance to Egypt.

This is mixed messaging. Under Secretary Sewall presented the
administration's policies clearly and firmly in Cairo, but her message
is undercut by her superiors' actions. Egyptian officials will listen to
Secretary Kerry's emollient platitudes about "democratic transition,"
and take the omission of human rights conditions from the budget as a
political gain.

#### Egypt instability goes nuclear

Affairs Strategic Policy, "Strategic Ramifications of the Egyptian
Crisis", World Tribune, 2-1,

In the preface to the Defense & Foreign Affairs Handbook on Egypt, in
1995, I noted: **[If Egypt remains strong]{.underline}**, and in all
senses a power in its regional contexts, then **[world]{.underline}**
events will [**move in one direction. [If]{.mark}** [Egypt\'s]{.mark}
strength is [undermined]{.mark}, then [world events]{.mark} (and not
merely those of the Middle East) [will move]{.mark} along a far more
uncertain and [violent]{.mark} path]{.underline}. It is significant that
[Egypt]{.underline} began to fail to be strong, internally, within a few
years of that 1995 book. It [became less resilient as Mubarak became
more isolated and the inspiration offered by Sadat began to erode. This
resulted in the]{.underline} [rise]{.underline} in Egypt
[of]{.underline} the [Islamists]{.underline} who had killed Sadat, and
the growing empowerment of the veteran Islamists from the Afghan
conflict, including such figures as Osama bin Laden (who had spent
considerable time living in Egypt), and Ayman al-Zawahiri, et al. The
reality was that Mubarak\'s management-style presidency could not offer
the requisite hope because hope translates to meaning and identity to
Egyptian society as it was transitioning from poverty and unemployment
to gradually growing wealth. What are the areas of strategic concern,
then, as Egypt transforms? The following are some considerations: \--
Security and [stability of Suez Canal sea traffic:
[Even]{.mark}]{.underline} temporary disruption, or [the [threat]{.mark}
of disruptions]{.underline}, to traffic through the Suez Canal [would
[disturb global trade, given]{.mark} that the
[Canal]{.mark}]{.underline} and the associated SUMED pipeline (which
takes crude oil north from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean) [are
responsible for significant volumes of world trade, including energy
shipments. [Threats]{.mark} of delays]{.underline} or closure of the
Canal and/or the SUMED, [or hints of increased danger [to
shipping]{.mark}, would [significantly increase]{.mark} insurance
[costs]{.mark} on trade, and]{.underline} would begin to [have
shippers]{.underline} consider [moving]{.underline} Suez
[traffic]{.underline}, once again, [to the longer and more expensive
Cape of Good Hope seaway]{.underline}. \-- [[Disruption of Nile]{.mark}
waters [negotiations]{.mark} and matters relating: [Egypt\'s support
for]{.mark} the emerging independence of]{.underline} South [[Sudan was
based on]{.underline}]{.mark} that new state s [[control]{.mark}
over]{.underline} a considerable stretch of [the White
Nile]{.underline}, at a time when Egypt has been attempting to dominate
new treaty discussions regarding Nile (White and Blue Nile) water usage
and riparian rights. Already, Egyptian ability to negotiate with the
Nile River states has entered an hiatus, and unless the Egyptian
Government is able to re-form quickly around a strong,
regionally-focused model, Egypt will have lost all momentum on securing
what it feels is its dominance over Nile water controls. In the short
term, [the]{.underline} Egyptian [[situation could provide tremors
into]{.underline}]{.mark} northern and South
[[Sudan]{.underline}]{.mark}, and in South Sudan [[this]{.mark} will
[mean]{.mark} that the [U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}, in particular, [could
be asked to step up [support activities]{.mark} to that
country\'s]{.underline} independence [transition]{.underline}. Such [a
sudden **[loss of Egypt\'s]{.mark}**]{.underline} Nile **[[position
will]{.mark} radically [affect]{.mark} its]{.underline}** long-standing
[[proxy war to keep Ethiopia]{.underline}]{.mark} which controls the
headwaters and flow of the Blue Nile, the Nile\'s biggest volume input
landlocked and strategically impotent. This means that Egypt\'s ability
to block African Union (AU) and Arab League denial of sovereignty
recognition of the Republic of Somaliland will decline or disappear for
the time being. Already Egypt\'s influence enabled an Islamist takeover
of Somaliland, possibly moving that state toward re-integration with the
anomic Somalia state. Equally importantly, the interregnum in Egypt will
mean a cessation of Cairo\'s support for Eritrea and the proxy war which
Eritrea facilitates but which others, particularly Egypt, pay against
Ethiopia through the arming, logistics, training, etc., of
anti-Ethiopian groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), the
Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), etc. \-- [Overall security of
the Red Sea states and SLOC: Egypt has been vital to sustaining the
tenuous viability of]{.underline} the state of [Eritrea]{.underline},
because Cairo regarded Eritrean loyalty as a key means of sustaining
Egyptian power projection into the Red Sea (and ensuring the security of
the Red Sea/Suez Sea Lane of Communication), and to deny such access to
Israel. [[Absent]{.mark} Egyptian [support]{.mark}, the
[Eritrea]{.mark}n Government]{.underline} of President Isayas Afewerke
[will begin to [feel]{.mark} its [isolation and]{.mark} economic
[deprivation, and]{.mark} may]{.underline} well, on its own,
[[accelerate]{.underline}]{.mark} new pressures for [[conflict]{.mark}
with Ethiopia [to distract]{.mark} local populations from the growing
deprivation in the country]{.underline}. \-- The Israel situation: [A
protracted [interregnum]{.mark} in Egypt]{.underline}, or a move by
Egypt toward Islamist or populist governance [[could bring]{.mark} about
a [decline in]{.mark} the stability of the [Egypt-Israel peace
agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, and provide an opening of the border
with the Hamas-controlled Gaza region of the Palestinian Authority
lands. [[This would contribute to]{.mark} the [ability of Iran to
escalate]{.mark} pressures on Israel, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} not only
further isolate Israel, but also [[isolate Jordan,
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, to an extent, [[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}. The threat of direct military engagement
between Israel and Egypt may remain low, but a move by Egypt away from
being a predictable part of the regional peace system would, by default,
accelerate the growth of the Iran-Syria-Hizbullah-Hamas ability to
strategically threaten Israel. Moreover, the transforming situation
would also inhibit the West Bank Palestinian Authority Government. \--
[Eastern Mediterranean stability: The [instability]{.mark}]{.underline},
and the possible move toward greater Islamist influence, [in Egypt
[reinforces]{.mark} the direction and potential for [control]{.mark} of
the regional agenda [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the Islamist Government of
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is certainly possible that [the
transformed [mood]{.mark}]{.underline} of the Eastern Mediterranean
[could [inhibit]{.mark} external investment in]{.underline} the
[[development of]{.mark} the major [gas]{.mark} fields off the Israeli
and Cyprus coasts]{.underline}. This may be a gradual process, but the
overall sense of the stability of the region particularly if Suez Canal
closure or de facto closure by any avoidance of it by shippers due to an
Islamist government in Cairo would be jeopardized if the area is no
longer the world s most important trade route. \-- Influence on Iran\'s
position: It should be considered that [any decline in Egypt\'s ability
to act as the major influence]{.underline} on the Arab [world enhances
Iran\'s]{.underline} de facto [position of authority]{.underline} in the
greater Middle East. It is true that Egypt\'s position has been in
decline in this regard for the past decade and more, and that even Saudi
Arabia has worked, successfully to a degree, to compete with Egypt for
regional (ie: Arab) leadership. [Without strong Egyptian]{.underline}
[leadership]{.underline}, however, [there is no real counterweight to
Iran\'s ability to intimidate]{.underline}. During the period of the
Shah\'s leadership in Iran (until the revolution of 1979 and the Shah\'s
departure, ultimately to his death and burial, ironically, in Cairo),
Iran and Egypt were highly compatible strategic partners, stabilizing
the region to a large degree. The Shah\'s first wife was Egyptian.
[Absent a strong Egypt]{.underline} (and, in reality, we have been
absent a strong Egypt for some years), [we can [expect growing Iranian
boldness]{.mark} in [supporting]{.mark}]{.underline} such
[groups]{.underline} as those [[fighting]{.mark} for the]{.underline}
so-called Islamic [Republic of Eastern Arabia]{.underline}. \-- U.S.
interests: [[A stable Egypt is critical for]{.mark} the maintenance of
U.S. [strategic interests]{.mark}, given its control of the Suez; its
partnership in the peace process with Israel; and so on]{.underline}.
Why, then, would the Barack Obama administration indicate that it would
support the masses in the streets of Egyptian cities at this point.
There is no question that Washington has supported moves to get Mubarak
to provide for a smooth succession over recent years: that would have
been beneficial for Egypt as well as for the U.S. But for the U.S. to
actively now support as Barack Obama has done the street over orderly
transition of power lacks strategic sense. It is true that the State
Dept., and even the strategically-challenged Vice President Joe Biden,
have urged caution on the Egyptian people, but Obama has effectively
contradicted that approach, as he did in Tunisia, where he literally
supported the street revolution against its president earlier in
January. [[If Egypt moves]{.mark} to anti-Western]{.underline},
anti-U.S. [governance, the [U.S. will be required to re-think its
entire]{.mark} strategic [approach to]{.mark} the [Middle East,
Africa]{.mark}, and the projection of power through the Eastern
[Mediterranean and]{.mark} into the [Indian]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline}.
It would give a strong boost of importance to the U.S. Pacific Fleet,
which is responsible for U.S. projection the Indian Ocean. CENTCOM
(Central Command) would need to be re-thought, as would USAFRICOM (U.S.
African Command). \-- Impact on the U.S. positions in Iraq, Afghanistan,
and Pakistan: [The [loss]{.mark} of Egypt]{.underline} and the
questionable ability which the U.S. could have over projection through
the Suez Canal if it came to that [would certainly [impact U.S]{.mark}.
ability to support the final [military operations]{.mark}]{.underline}
it has [in Iraq, and Afghanistan. A]{.underline} loss (or
[[jeopardizing]{.underline}]{.mark}) [of U.S.]{.underline} [military
[access via Egyptian]{.mark}-controlled [areas]{.mark}]{.underline} such
as the Red Sea/Suez [would absolutely [fragment]{.mark} the [way]{.mark}
in which the [U.S. can project power]{.mark} globally. Even the
accession of an Islamist state in Egypt, as opposed to closure of the
Suez Canal, would achieve much of this]{.underline}. What is clear is
that the U.S. did not adequately prepare for the end of the Mubarak era,
even though it was absolutely obvious that it was coming. Now, only by
luck will the U.S. see the Egyptian armed forces re-assert control over
Egypt and introduce a new generation of leadership to bridge the
transition until the re-emergence of a charismatic leader.

**[[Even]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[before]{.mark} Donald
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}** put **[[America]{.underline}]{.mark}**
first, the Republican Party **[[had]{.underline}]{.mark}** largely
**[[walked away from international treaty law]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Now Trump's "America First" is likely to mean a further denigration of
international law and process, **[to the further]{.underline}**
**[detriment of America's national security and long-term
interests]{.underline}**. Consider the following tale of our times. In
1973 the United States passed landmark legislation to protect people
with disabilities, and this was followed by the pioneering Americans
with Disabilities Act in 1990. The ADA in turn inspired the member
states of the United Nations to adopt the Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities. President Barack Obama signed the CRPD in
2009, but the US Senate then refused to ratify it, voting 61 in favor,
38 against, falling five votes short of the two-thirds majority needed
for ratification. The United States thereby joined a handful of other
countries that have signed but not ratified the treaty, including Libya,
North Korea, and Uzbekistan. One-hundred-sixty other countries have
ratified the treaty, including Canada, Japan, most European countries,
and indeed most of the world. The 38 Senators in opposition, all
Republican, were persuaded by anti-UN activists that the Treaty "would
surrender our nation's sovereignty to unelected UN bureaucrats." They
also argued that since this country already had such protections in the
ADA, joining the treaty was of no benefit to the United States. They
feared that the treaty would somehow prevent home schooling and other
parental rights. To a remarkable extent, **[the]{.underline}**
**[Republican Party]{.underline}** **[has thrown down the
gauntlet]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** UN
**[treaties]{.underline}**: **[If the rest of the world agrees on
something]{.underline}**, even something **[modeled on US
leadership]{.underline}**, **[it is treated as]{.underline}** suspect
and even **[dangerous]{.underline}** **[for the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to
join]{.underline}** with those countries in **[a treaty]{.underline}**,
on the ostensible grounds **[that]{.underline}** the treaty obligations
**[would]{.underline}** **[infringe US sovereignty]{.underline}**.
**[[The list of global agreements]{.mark} in which
[the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[refuses]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[to participate [is]{.mark} [long and growing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Another notable case is the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to
prevent the abuse, exploitation, and capital punishment of children.
This treaty was adopted by the UN in 1989 and came into force in 1990,
after a sufficient number of countries had ratified it. The United
States held out. Others kept joining. Now every single UN member state
except the United States has ratified the treaty, but US Senate
Republicans still balk. Once again, US conservatives argue that the
treaty would violate US sovereignty. The United States has stayed out of
the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (1991), the Convention on
Biological Diversity (1992), the Comprehensive \[Nuclear\] Test Ban
Treaty (1997), the Ottawa Land Mine Treaty (1997), and the International
Criminal Court (1998), among many others. In each case, one argument is
that treaty membership would limit US sovereignty. Other reasons are
given as well. The US Senate, again largely on the Republican side,
objected to the UN Law of the Sea on the grounds that it would limit
American companies from earning profits from deep-sea mining. It
objected to the Convention on Biological Diversity on the grounds that
protecting endangered species would threaten the private property rights
of US farmers and ranchers, especially in the large landholdings in the
west. Hard-line senators objected to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
on the grounds that it was not verifiable, despite expert opinion to the
contrary. The United States has stayed out of the land mine treaty not
just because of Senate opposition but because the US military has
continued to use land mines in the defense of South Korea. The US
failure to join the International Criminal Court is especially
revealing. First, the United States voted against the ICC in the UN
General Assembly, alongside Iraq, Libya, China, Yemen, and a few others,
after unsuccessfully demanding the right as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council to veto cases before the court. Then, in 2000,
President Clinton signed the Rome Statute establishing the ICC but did
not submit the statute for Senate ratification. Next, George W. Bush
formally notified the court that the US would not seek membership,
expressing concern that US military personnel might be subjected to ICC
charges. The US pursued a policy of signing more than 100 "bilateral
immunity agreements" (BIAs) in which countries commit not to deliver US
nationals to the ICC. Some countries faced cutoffs in US foreign aid
when they balked at signing BIAs. In 2009, Obama declared that the US
would participate in the ICC as an observer. While strongly resisting
ICC jurisdiction vis-a-vis US nationals, the US government has
repeatedly and insistently called on the ICC to take judicial action
against other countries' leaders --- for example, Omar al-Bashir, the
president of Sudan. The Senate's aversion to any form of UN treaties is
now so intense and pervasive that none have been ratified in the past
decade and only one (on cybercrime) in the past 15 years. The list of
unsigned or unratified treaties continues to grow, and the US
increasingly stands almost alone in the world in remaining aloof from
these UN agreements. Our disdain for globally shared and negotiated
rules is clear for all the world to see. **[The logic of treaty-making
should be clear enough. In principle, treaties involve areas where
nation states can potentially do serious harm to other nation states
(pollution, arms races, arms trade, war) or where vital global
protection of vulnerable populations (children, refugees) is at stake.
Countries give up their sovereignty reciprocally]{.underline}**. On
issues of interstate relations, each individual nation agrees to refrain
from harmful actions against the other nations on the condition that the
other nations agree to refrain from the same actions against the country
in question. It is, of course, nothing more than the Golden Rule put
into the framework of international law. In general, there is no global
"sheriff" to enforce the treaty, and opponents of these treaties
routinely argue that they are indeed unenforceable. **[Yet there is a
reason why the foes of these treaties work so hard to prevent their
ratification by the US Senate]{.underline}**. They believe, and rightly,
that **[if the United States actually ratifies an agreement, it is more
likely to follow through on its implementation]{.underline}**. To break
a treaty, after all, is to incur a global reputation as a deal breaker
and to risk not just a bad reputation but also a coalition of countries
pressing for a return to compliance. In some cases, including violations
of the rules of international trade under the World Trade Organization
(WTO), the treaty provides for specific enforcement terms. Moreover, the
US government is typically very happy, even insistent, that other
countries are living up to the terms of international agreements. I've
noted the US support for various ICC proceedings. Similarly, the US
routinely relies on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Likewise,
the United States had aimed to further many of the specific objectives
of the Convention on Biological Diversity while not being a signatory to
the agreement. The Republican Party objection to international law has
three underpinnings. The first is a historical image, essentially a
founding myth, of America as untethered in its fate from the rest of the
world. This attitude is expressed in a [draft trade policy
agenda](http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/1dd70b12-fe25-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30.pdf)
released by the Trump administration: "Ever since the United States won
its independence, it has been a basic principle of our country that
American citizens are subject only to laws and regulations made by the
US government -- not rulings made by foreign governments or
international bodies. This principle remains true today. Accordingly,
the Trump administration will aggressively defend American sovereignty
over matters of trade policy." The second is an implicit belief that
America's security and economic interests -- in the sea, or the
environment, or armaments -- can all be achieved largely through
American actions alone rather than the sum of the actions of all of the
world. According to this view, the US has little interest in what other
countries are doing. The third is an overarching **[faith
in]{.underline}** "**[US primacy]{.underline}**," the idea **[that the
US can protect its interest]{.underline}** **[through its power
alone]{.underline}**, **[without]{.underline}** the need to rely on
international rules and **[international law]{.underline}**. **[These
beliefs are]{.underline}** **[wrong]{.underline}**. From the start of

1940s to the 1970s, the US led the way in promoting UN-based treaty law.

### Ilaw\-\--A2: Fails

#### Multilat is effective \-\-- answers all their warrants

Vincent **Pouliot 11**, Director of the Centre for International Peace
and Security Studies @ McGill University and Associate Prof. of
Political Science. "Multilateralism as an End in Itself," Feb 20, Wiley
Online Library

Because it rests on open, nondiscriminatory debate, and the routine
exchange of viewpoints, the **[multilateral procedure introduces three
key advantages]{.underline}** that are gained, **[regardless of the
specific policies adopted]{.underline}**, and tend to diffuse across all
participants. Contrary to the standard viewpoint, according to which a
rational preference or functional imperative lead to multilateral
cooperation, here it is **[the systematic practice of
[multilat]{.mark}eralism]{.underline}** that **[[creates the drive to
cooperate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the theoretical level, the premise
is that it is not only what people think that explains what they do, but
also what they do that determines what they think (Pouliot 2010).
**[Everyday multilateralism is a self-fulfilling practice]{.underline}**
for at least three reasons.¶ First, the **[joint practice of
multilateralism creates mutually recognizable patterns of action among
global actors]{.underline}**. This process owes to the fact that
practices structure social interaction (Adler and Pouliot forthcoming).2
Because they are meaningful, organized, and repeated, **[practices
generally convey a degree of [mutual intelligibility]{.mark} that
[allows people to develop]{.mark} social [relations]{.mark} over time.
In the field of international security, for example, the practice of
deterrence is premised on]{.underline}** a limited number of gestures,
signals, and linguistic devices that are meant, as Schelling (1966:113)
put it, to **[''getting the right signal across.'']{.underline}** The
same goes with the practice of
**[[multilateral]{.mark}ism]{.underline}**, which **[rests on a set
of]{.underline}** political and social **[patterns that establish the
boundaries of action in a mutually intelligible fashion. These
[structuring effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in turn, **[[allow
for]{.mark} the development of [common frameworks for appraising global
events]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Multilateral [dialog
serves]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only **[[to find joint
solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**; it also makes it possible for various
actors to zoom in on the definition of the issue at hand---a
particularly important step on the global stage.¶ **[The point is
certainly not that the multilateral procedure leads everybody to agree
on everything]{.underline}**---that would be as impossible as
counterproductive. Theoretically speaking, there is room for skepticism
that multilateralism may ever allow communicative rationality at the
global level (see Risse 2000; Diez and Steans 2005). With such a diverse
and uneven playing field, one can doubt that discursive engagement, in
and of itself, can lead to common lifeworlds. **[Instead,
what]{.underline}** the practice of **[multilateralism fosters
is]{.underline}** the emergence of **[a shared framework of
interaction]{.underline}**---for example, a common linguistic
repertoire---**[that allows global [actors]{.mark} to make sense of
world politics in mutually recognizable ways]{.underline}**. Of course,
**[they may not agree on]{.underline}** the **[specific
actions]{.underline}** to be taken, **[but at least they [can build
on]{.mark} an established pattern of [political interaction to deal with
the problem]{.mark} at hand]{.underline}**---sometimes even **[[before
it emerges]{.mark} in acute form.]{.underline}** In today's pluralistic
world, that would already be a considerable achievement.¶ In that sense,
**[multilateralism may well be a constitutive practice of]{.underline}**
what Lu (2009) calls ''**[political friendship among
peoples]{.underline}**.'' The axiomatic practice of principled and
inclusive dialog is quite apparent in the way she describes this social
structure: ''**[While conflicts, especially over the distribution of
goods and burdens, will inevitably arise, under conditions of political
friendship among peoples, they will be negotiated within a global
background context of norms and institutions based on mutual
recognition, equity in the distribution of burdens and benefits of
global cooperation, and power-sharing]{.underline}** in the institutions
of global governance rather than domination by any group''
(2009:54--55). **[In a world where multilateralism becomes an end in
itself, this ideal pattern emerges]{.underline}** out of the structuring
effects of axiomatic practice: **[take the case of NATO]{.underline}**,
for instance, **[which has recently had to manage, through the
multilateral practice, fairly strong internal dissent]{.underline}**
(Pouliot 2006). **[[While clashing views]{.mark} and interests [will
never go away]{.mark}]{.underline}** in our particularly diverse world,
**[as pessimists are quick to emphasize]{.underline}** (for example,
Dahl 1999), **[the [management of discord is]{.mark} certainly [made
easier by]{.mark}]{.underline}** shared patterns of dialog based on
**[[mutual]{.mark}ly recognizable [frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.¶
Second, the **[[multilat]{.mark}eral procedure]{.underline}** typically
**[[ensures]{.mark} a remarkable level of [moderation
in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[global policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**
adopted. In fact, a quick historical tour d'horizon suggests that
**[actors engaged in multilateralism tend to avoid radical solutions in
their]{.underline}** joint **[decision making]{.underline}**. Of course,
**[[the]{.mark} very [process of uniting disparate voices helps]{.mark}
explain why multilateralism tends to [produce]{.mark}]{.underline}**
median [**[consensus]{.underline}**. **[This is not to say that the
multil]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ateral practice inevitably [leads to
lowest common denominators.]{.mark}]{.underline}** To repeat, because it
entails complex and often painstaking debate before any actions are
taken, the multilateral procedure forces involved actors to devise and
potentially share similar analytical lenses that, in hindsight, make the
policies adopted seem inherently, and seemingly ''naturally,'' moderate.
This is because the debate about what a given policy means takes place
before its implementation, which makes for a much smoother ride when
decisions hit the ground. This joint interpretive work, which
constitutes a crucial aspect of multilateralism, creates outcomes that
are generally perceived as inherently reasonable. **[Participation
brings inherent benefits to politics]{.underline}**, as Bachrach (1975)
argued in the context of democratic theory. Going after the conventional
liberal view according to which actors enter politics with an already
fixed set of preferences, **[Bachrach observes that most of the time
people define their interests in the very process of
participation.]{.underline}** The argument is not that interests formed
in the course of social interaction are in any sense more altruistic. It
rather is that the nature and process of political practices, in this
case multilateralism, matter a great deal in shaping participants'
preferences (Wendt 1999). In this sense, not only does the multilateral
practice have structuring effects on global governance, but it is also
constitutive of what actors say, want, and do (Adler and Pouliot
forthcoming).¶ **[Third]{.underline}** and related,
**[[multilat]{.mark}eralism [lends legitimacy to]{.mark} the
[policies]{.mark} that [it generates by]{.mark} virtue of [the debate
that the process]{.mark} necessarily [entails]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
There is no need here to explain at length how **[deliberative processes
that are inclusive of all stakeholders tend to produce outcomes that are
generally considered more]{.underline}** socially and politically
**[acceptable. In the long run, the large
[ownership]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[leads to more efficient
implementation, because actors feel invested]{.mark} in the enactment of
solutions]{.underline}** on the ground. **[Even episodes of political
failure, such as]{.underline}** the lack of UN reaction to the
**[Rwandan]{.underline}** genocide, **[can generate useful lessons when
re-appropriated multilaterally---think of the Responsibility to Protect,
for instance]{.underline}**.3 From this outlook, there is no
contradiction between efficiency and the axiomatic practice of
multilateralism, quite the contrary. **[The more multilateralism becomes
the norm]{.underline}**al or self-evident practice of global governance,
**[the more benefits it yields]{.underline}** for the many stakeholders
of global governance. In fact, multilateralism as an end in and of
itself could generate even more diffuse reciprocity than Ruggie had
originally envisioned. Not only do its distributional consequences tend
to even out, **[[multilat]{.mark}eralism as a global governance
routine]{.underline}** also **[[creates self-reinforcing dynamics
and]{.mark} new focal points for strategic interaction. The axiomatic
practice of multilateralism [helps]{.mark} define problems in
commensurable ways and [craft]{.mark} moderate
[solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** with wide-ranging ownership---three
processual benefits that further strengthen the impetus for multilateral
dialog. Pg. 21-23

### Ilaw\-\--A2: Fails\-\--Author\-\--Posner

#### Their ev is [wrong]{.underline} about i-law\-\--it's [effective]{.underline} and [vital]{.underline} to global coop

Joel P. **Trachtman 9**, Professor of International Law, Tufts
University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, 2009, Review of The
Perils of Global Legalism,
<http://www.globallawbooks.org/reviews/detail.asp?id=627>

At the core of this book is **[[Posner]{.mark}'s argument that
international law is]{.underline}** generally
**[ineffective]{.underline}** to address international collective action
problems. He **[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}** (p. 39) that "**[[theory
suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[coop]{.mark}eration to solve
global]{.underline}** collective action **[problems [will be
limited]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Neither this book, nor his previous
work, does much to develop this theory, and indeed, **[[analysis
shows]{.mark} that [theory suggests no such
thing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

For Posner, while world government is needed, it becomes less likely as
the number of states in the world increases, and the number of states in
the world seems to be increasing. Posner posits that there will be
greater demand for cooperation as the number of states increases,
because these states would necessarily be smaller and therefore unable
to supply public goods at the optimal level when the optimal level is
greater than their size. There may also be technological, social and
economic reasons why more international law may become necessary. Yet
**[[for Posner]{.underline}]{.mark}** the conundrum is that **[[as the
number of states increases, coop]{.mark}eration [is less
likely]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Why does an increased number of states mean]{.underline}** that
**[effective international law is less likely?]{.underline}** Although
**[[this assumption]{.underline}]{.mark}** is central to Posner's book,
it **[[is not supported]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and in fact, **[while it
is likely to be true in some particular circumstances,]{.underline}**
[**[it cannot be generally true]{.underline}**. **[Posner
concedes]{.underline}**]{.mark} (p. 90) that **[[there is no
basis]{.mark} for his assumption]{.underline}**, stating that he "awaits
proof" that compliance declines with the number of states, [**[yet this
assumption is]{.underline}** **[central to his
thesis]{.underline}**]{.mark}.\[4\] Indeed, as Norman and Trachtman
(2005) have shown in theory,\[5\] in response to earlier work by Posner
and Goldsmith,\[6\] compliance with international law could either
increase or decrease with the number of states involved, depending on
other parameters. For example, **[[in]{.mark} the case of [public
goods]{.mark}]{.underline}** where the benefit from the public good
increases with the number of states that contribute, **[[cooperation
will become more likely as the number of states
increases]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So, there will never be proof, along
the lines Posner awaits, that compliance with international law
generally declines with the number of states.

In fact, there may be reason to expect the opposite effect. Posner
posits that **[[greater demand for coop]{.mark}eration [will arise from
a larger number of states]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[This]{.underline}**]{.mark} greater value of cooperation
[**[would]{.underline}** **[systematically make
coop]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[eration [more likely, not less]{.mark}
likely]{.underline}**. Furthermore, even if we provisionally accept
Posner's incorrect assertion that cooperation generally becomes more
difficult with more states, he has no way to know which effect is
greater: the increasing value of cooperation or the increasing
difficulty of cooperation. So, even if we were to accept Posner's notion
that cooperation generally becomes more difficult as the number of
states increases, this countervailing effect makes it impossible to draw
the conclusion drawn by Posner: that cooperation becomes less likely.

These beliefs are wrong. From the start of our nation's history, but
especially today, **[[America's]{.mark} prosperity and [security depend
on]{.mark} a body of [international law]{.mark} developed over the
course of centuries that help [to govern]{.mark} international
[trade]{.mark}, intellectual property, global [health]{.mark},
international financial flows, [arms control]{.mark}, and nuclear
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration, human rights, [environmental

global economy could not function, nor could the world successfully
fight newly emerging [diseases, control cross-border criminal
activities, or preserve]{.mark} the [peace among]{.mark} the [major
powers.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [needs to care profoundly what

nonproliferation, pollution control, climate change, the movements of
terrorists, the laundering of illicit funds, narcotics trafficking,
human trafficking, tax administration, financial stability, and the
countless other areas governed by treaties and other forms of
international law. Without international treaty agreements on such
issues, there are no reliable and practical ways to promote the peaceful
and beneficial behavior of the world's 193 nations.]{.underline}**

#### [Extinction's inevitable]{.underline} without a strong global legal architecture \-\-- nuclear war, environment, economic collapse

**Damrosch 95** (Lori, Professor of Law -- Columbia University and Rein
Mullerson, Professor of Law -- Kings College, Beyond Confrontation, p.
1-2)

[[The]{.mark} contemporary\' [world has an ever-increasing need
for]{.mark} [an international legal system that can respond
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[demands]{.underline}]{.mark} of our time.
Of the many reasons for this fact, we will survey only a few of the most
salient. [First and foremost is]{.underline} the [[increas]{.mark}ing
[interdependence]{.mark} of all peoples]{.underline}. Even as the world
is riven with many contradictions and conflicts, it is also becoming
more integrated with a greater need for orderly, predictable conduct.
Events, and especially natural and social disasters, even when they
occur within a single country, have more noticeable effects on
conditions in the world at large. The Chernobyl accident, the earthquake
in Armenia, and internal political processes underway in the territories
of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. These and many other
[[events]{.underline}]{.mark} occurring [within separate
countries]{.underline} or regions [[have a global
significance]{.underline}]{.mark} affecting the destiny of all peoples.
The intertwining of the economic life of diverse countries today is even
greater than was the interdependence of different regions within the
same state only half a century ago. [[Order]{.mark} and
predictability]{.underline} of the behavior of actors on the
international scene [[can be achieved]{.underline}]{.mark} first of all
[[with]{.mark} the aid of social [norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, among
which international law occupies an important place. A second reason for
the growth of the role of international law is inextricably connected
with the first. [The [threats of]{.mark} a [thermonuclear
catastrophe]{.mark}, [universal ecological crisis, and]{.mark} [acute
economic problems]{.mark}]{.underline} in developing countries
[[are]{.mark} of [global concern]{.mark} [and endanger]{.mark} the very
existence of [humanity]{.mark}. [Resolution]{.mark} of these problems
[demands coordinated efforts]{.mark} of all states and peoples, which
would be [impossible]{.mark} to achieve [without]{.mark} the aid of
[international]{.mark}]{.underline} norms,
[[procedures]{.underline}]{.mark}, institutions.

#### A myriad of emerging threats risk extinction \-\-- it's try-or-die for maximizing the effectiveness of global governance

**Brooks 14** \[Rosa, 11/13, Professor of Law at Georgetown & Schwartz
Sr. Fellow at the New America Foundation, November 13, 2014,
<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/11/13/a_strategyless_nation_america_democrats_grand_strategy_foreign_policy>\]

I\'ve written about these issues before (here and here), and at risk of
being both a narcissist and a broken record, I\'ll quote myself: The
world has grown more complex. Believe it. The world now contains more
people living in more states than ever before, and we\'re all more
interconnected. A hundred years ago, the world population was about 1.8
billion, there were roughly 60 sovereign states in the world, the
automobile was still a rarity, and there were no commercial passenger
flights and no transcontinental telephone service. Fifty years ago,
global population had climbed to more than 3 billion and there were 115
U.N. member states, but air travel was still for the wealthy and the
personal computer still lay two decades in the future. Today? We\'ve got
7 billion people living in 192 U.N. member states and a handful of other
territories. These 7 billion people take 93,000 commercial flights a day
from 9,000 airports, drive 1 billion cars, and carry 7 billion mobile
phones around with them. In numerous ways, life has gotten substantially
better in this more crowded and interconnected era. **[Seventy years
ago, global war killed]{.underline}** scores of
**[millions]{.underline}**, but **[interstate conflict has declined
sharply since the end of World War II, and]{.underline}** **[the
creation of the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations **[ushered in a]{.underline}** far **[more
egalitarian]{.underline}** and democratic **[form of international
governance than existed in any previous era.]{.underline}** Today,
**[militarily powerful states are far less free than in the pre-U.N. era
to use overt force]{.underline}** to accomplish their aims, and **[the
world now has numerous transnational courts and dispute-resolution
bodies that collectively offer states a viable alternative to the use of
force.]{.underline}** **[The modern international order is no global
utopia, but it sure beats colonial domination and world
wars]{.underline}**. In the 50 years that followed World War II, medical
and agricultural advances brought unprecedented health and prosperity to
most parts of the globe. More recently, the communications revolution
has enabled exciting new forms of nongovernmental cross-border alliances
to emerge, empowering, for instance, global human rights and
environmental movements. In just the last two decades, the
near-universal penetration of mobile phones has had a powerful leveling
effect: All over the globe, people at every age and income level can use
these tiny but powerful computers to learn foreign languages, solve
complex mathematical problems, create and share videos, watch the news,
move money around, or communicate with far-flung friends. **[All this
has had a dark side]{.underline}**, of course. As access to knowledge
has been democratized, so too has access to the tools of violence and
destruction, and **[greater global [interconnectedness enables]{.mark}
disease, pollution, and [conflict to]{.mark} [spread quickly]{.mark} and
easily [beyond borders]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A hundred years ago, no
single individual or nonstate actor could do more than cause localized
mayhem; today, we have to worry about massive bioengineered threats
created by tiny terrorist cells and globally devastating cyberattacks
devised by malevolent teen hackers. Even as many forms of power have
grown more democratized and diffuse, other forms of power have grown
more concentrated. A very small number of states control and consume a
disproportionate share of the world\'s resources, and a very small
number of individuals control most of the world\'s wealth. (According to
a 2014 Oxfam report, the 85 richest individuals on Earth are worth more
than the globe\'s 3.5 billion poorest people). Indeed, **[[from a
species-survival perspective, the world has grown]{.mark} vastly more
[dangerous]{.mark} over the last century]{.underline}**. Individual
humans live longer than ever before, but **[a small number of
[states]{.mark} now [possess the]{.mark} unprecedented [ability to
destroy]{.mark} large chunks of [the human race]{.mark} and possibly the
Earth itself]{.underline}** \-- all **[in]{.underline}** **[a matter
of]{.underline}** days or even **[hours]{.underline}**. What\'s more,
though the near-term threat of interstate nuclear conflict has greatly
diminished since the end of the Cold War, **[[nuclear material]{.mark}
and know-how [are]{.mark} now both less controlled and [less
controllable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Amid all these changes, **[our
world has also grown far more uncertain]{.underline}**. We possess more
information than ever before and vastly greater processing power, but
the accelerating pace of global change has far exceeded our collective
ability to understand it, much less manage it. This makes it
increasingly difficult to make predictions or calculate risks. As I\'ve
written previously: **[We literally have no points of comparison for
understanding the scale and scope of the risks faced by humanity
today.]{.underline}** **[Compared to the long, slow sweep of human
history, the]{.underline}** **[events]{.underline}** of the last century
**[have taken place in the blink of an eye.]{.underline}** This should
\... give us pause when we\'re tempted to conclude that today\'s trends
are likely to continue. Rising life expectancy? That\'s great, but if
climate change has consequences as nasty as some predict, a century of
rising life expectancy could turn out to be a mere blip on the charts. A
steep decline in interstate conflicts? Fantastic, but less than 70 years
of human history isn\'t much to go on\.... That\'s why **[[one can\'t
dismiss]{.mark} the risk of [catastrophic events \[]{.mark}such
[as]{.mark} disastrous climate change or nuclear conflict\] as \"high
consequence, [low probability.]{.mark}]{.underline}**[\"]{.mark} **[How
do we compute the probability of catastrophic events of a type that has
never happened]{.underline}**? Does 70 years without nuclear
annihilation tell us that there\'s a low probability of nuclear
catastrophe \-- or just tell us that we haven\'t had a nuclear
catastrophe yet?\... Lack of catastrophic change might signify a system
in stable equilibrium, but sometimes \-- as with earthquakes \--
pressure may be building up over time, undetected\.... Most analysts
assumed the Soviet Union was stable \-- until it collapsed. Analysts
predicted that Egypt\'s Hosni Mubarak would retain his firm grip on
power \-- until he was ousted. How much of what we currently file under
\"Stable\" should be recategorized under \"Hasn\'t Collapsed Yet\"?
This, then, is the character of world messiness in this first quarter of
the 21st century. So on to the next question: Where, in all this
messiness, does the United States find itself?

This has urgent implications for U.S. strategic planning. Precisely
because U.S. global power may very well continue to decline, the United
States should use the very considerable military, political, cultural,
and economic power it still has to foster the international order most
likely to benefit the country if it someday loses that power.

**[[The]{.mark} ultimate [objective]{.mark} of U.S. grand strategy
[should be]{.mark} the creation of an equitable and peaceful
[international order]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[with]{.mark} an
[effective]{.mark} system of [global governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**
--- **[one that is [built upon]{.mark} respect for human dignity, [human
rights,]{.mark} and the rule of law]{.underline}**, with robust
mechanisms for resolving thorny collective problems.

We should seek this not because it's the "morally right" thing for the
United States to do, but because a maximin decision rule should lead us
to conclude that this will offer the United States and its population
the best chance of continuing to thrive, even in the event of a radical
future decline in U.S. wealth and power.

But, one might argue, the United States already tries to promote such a
global order --- right?

Sure it does --- but only inconsistently, and generally as something of
an afterthought. We pour money into our military and intelligence
communities, but starve our diplomats and development agencies. We
fixate on the threat du jour, often exaggerating it and allowing it to
distort our foreign policy in self-destructive ways (cf. Iraq War),
while viewing matters such as United Nations reform or reform of global
economic institutions or environmental protection rules as tedious and
of low priority. **[If we take seriously the many potential
dangers]{.underline}** **[lurking in the unknowable
future]{.underline}**, however, **[fostering a stronger, fairer, and
more effective system of international governance]{.underline}**
**[would become]{.underline}** a matter of urgent national self-interest
and **[our highest strategic priority]{.underline}** --- something that
should be reflected both in our policies and in our budgetary decisions.

**[An effective global governance system [would]{.mark} need to [be
built upon]{.mark} the [recognition]{.mark} that states remain the
primary mode of political and social organization in the international
sphere]{.underline}**, **[but also upon the recognition [that]{.mark}
new forms of social organization continue to evolve and]{.underline}**
**[may ultimately displace at least some states]{.underline}**. **[[An
effective]{.mark} and dynamic international [system]{.mark} [will need
to develop innovative ways to bring]{.mark} such [new actors and
organizations within]{.mark} the ambit of [i]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark} and institutions]{.underline}**, both **[as responsible
creators of law and institutions and as responsible
subjects]{.underline}**.

### Ilaw\-\--A2: No War

#### Robust I-law empirically prevents [conflict escalation]{.underline} among great powers

John **Vasquez 9**, Thomas B. Mackie Scholar of International Relations
and Professor of Political Science at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, PhD in Poli Sci from Syracuse University, "Peace,"
Chapter 8 in The War Puzzle Revisited, p 298-299, google books

Wallensteen's examination of the characteristics of particularist
periods provides significant additional evidence that the steps-to-war
analysis is on the right track. Realist practices are associated with
war, and peaceful systems are associated with an emphasis on other
practices. Peaceful systems are exemplified by the use of practices like
buffer states, compensation, and concerts of power that bring major
states together to form a network of institutions that provide
governance for the system. **[[The creation of rules of the
game]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[can]{.underline}** handle certain
kinds of issues -- territorial and ideological questions -- and/or keep
them off the agenda **[[seems to be a crucial variable in producing
peace.]{.underline}]{.mark}¶** Additional evidence on the import of
rules and norms is provided in **[[a series of studies]{.mark} by Kegley
and Raymond]{.underline}** (1982, 1984, 1986, 1990) **[[that are
operationally]{.mark} more [precise]{.mark}]{.underline}** than
Wallensteen's (1984) analysis. Kegley and Raymond **[[provide evidence
that when states accept norms, the incidence of war]{.mark} and military
confrontation [is reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They find that peace
is associated with periods in which alliance norms are considered
binding and the unilateral abrogation of commitments and treaties
illegitimate. **[The [rules]{.mark} imposed by the global political
culture]{.underline}** in these periods **[[result in fewer militarized
disputes and wars between major states]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
addition, **[the [wars that occur are kept at lower levels]{.mark} of
severity, magnitude, and duration (i.e. they are limited
wars).]{.underline}**¶ Kegley and Raymond attempt to measure the extent
to which global cultural norms restrain major states by looking at
whether international law and commentary on it sees treaties and
alliances as binding. They note that there have been two traditions in
international law -- pacta sunt servanda, which maintains that
agreements are binding, and clausa rebus sic stantibus, which says that
treaties are signed "as matters stand" and that any change in
circumstances since the treaty was signed permits a party to withdraw
unilaterally. One of the advantages the Kegley-Raymond studies have over
Wallensteen (1984) is that they are able to develop reliable measures of
the extent to which in any given half-decade that tradition in
international law emphasizes the rebus or pacta sunt servanda tradition.
This indicator is important not only because it focuses in on the
question of unilateral actions, but because it can serve as an indicator
of how well the peace system is working. The pacta sunt servanda
tradition implies a more constraining political system and robust
institutional context which should provide an alternative to war.¶
Kegley and Raymond (1982: 586) find that in half-decades (from 1820 to
1914) when treaties are considered non-binding (rebus), wars between
major states occur in every half-decade (100 percent), but when treaties
are considered binding (pacta sunt servanda), wars between major states
occur in only 50 percent of the half-decades. The Cramer's V for this
relationship is .66. When the sample is expanded to include all states
in the central system, Cramer's V is 0.44, indicating that global norms
have more impact on preventing war between major states. Nevertheless,
among central system states between 1820 and 1939, war occurred in 93
percent of the half-decades where the rebus tradition dominated and in
only 60 percent of the half-decades where the pacta sunt sevanda
tradition dominated.¶ **[In]{.underline}** a subsequent **[[analysis of
militarized disputes from 1820 to 1914]{.mark}, Kegley and
Raymond]{.underline}** (1984: 207-11) **[[find]{.mark} that there is [a
negative relationship between binding norms and the frequency and
scope]{.mark} of disputes short of war.]{.underline}** In periods when
the global culture accepts the pacta sunt servanda tradition as the
norm, the number of military disputes goes down and the number of major
states involved in a dispute decreases. Although the relationship is of
moderate strength, it is not eliminated by other variables, namely
alliance flexibility. As Kegley and Raymond (1984: 213) point out, this
means "that **[in periods [when]{.mark} the opportunistic [renunciation
of commitments" is condoned, militarized disputes are more
likely]{.mark} to occur and to spread. [The finding that norms]{.mark}
can [reduce]{.mark} the frequency and scope of [disputes is significant
evidence that rules]{.mark} can [permit actors to]{.mark} successfully
control and [manage disputes so]{.mark} that [they are not contagious
and]{.mark} they [do not escalate to war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These
findings are consistent with Wallensteen's (1984) and suggest that one
of the ways rules help prevent war is by reducing, limiting, and
managing disputes short of war.

**[It is frequently contended that the United States ratifies few
international human rights treaties]{.underline}**. While
**[this]{.underline}** may be true in relative terms, it **[does not
fairly represent the scope of commitments the United States has in fact
undertaken under international human rights law, particularly over the
last two decades]{.underline}**. **[Under growing]{.underline}**
**[[pressure from]{.mark} domestic and international
[constituents]{.mark} and [with strong bipartisan support]{.mark},
[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [ratified a]{.mark}n
increasingly broad [spectrum of]{.mark} [h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights
[treaties,]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[under Republican and Democratic
administrations alike]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thus,
**[under]{.underline}** the administrations of George **[[H.W.
Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}**, William J. **[[Clinton,
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** George **[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Bush,
**[the United States has [ratified the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
[(**[ICCPR]{.underline}**]{.mark}),23 **[the]{.underline}** Convention
Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment **[([CAT]{.mark}]{.underline}**), 24 **[the]{.underline}**
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination (**[[CER]{.mark}D]{.underline}**),25 **[[the Convention
on]{.mark} the Prevention]{.underline}** and Punishment of the Crime
**[of [Genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}**,26 **[[a series of ILO treaties
on labor rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**,27 **[and [the Optional Protocols
to the]{.mark} [C]{.mark}onvention on the [R]{.mark}ights of the
[C]{.mark}hild]{.underline}** on the Involvement of Children in Armed
Conflict and on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child
Pornography.28 **[The United States has also ratified human rights
treaties relating to slavery]{.underline}**,29
**[refugees,]{.underline}**30 **[and the political rights of
women]{.underline}**,31 among others,32 and has ratified the OAS
Charter, which subjects it to the quasi-judicial jurisdiction of the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights with respect to the rights
enshrined in the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of
Man.33¶ **[Taken together, these treaties cover a vast spectrum of
rights]{.underline}**---of a civil, cultural, economic, political, and
social nature---and extend horizontally under three distinct
supranational supervisory systems, each with its own set of promotional
and quasi-adjudicatory powers. In this sense[,
**[while]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[critical [attention is]{.mark} often
[focused]{.mark} on the [U.S. failure to]{.mark} ratify certain
internationally [popular treaties]{.mark}, including]{.underline}** the
Convention on the Rights of the Child **[(CRC)]{.underline}**, the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women (**[[CEDAW]{.mark})]{.underline}**, the American Convention on
Human Rights, **[and the]{.underline}** International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(**[[ICESCR)]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[it must be recognized that [the
scope]{.mark} of international commitments [implicated by these]{.mark}
treaties [has already]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in large measure, **[[been
undertaken by the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates pursuant to
the treaties that it has ratified.]{.underline}**34 **[This
[reality]{.mark}]{.underline}** complicates the utility for partisan
actors of wholesale opposition to currently nonratified treaties. It
also **[[undermines claims that the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [fails to ratify]{.mark} human rights [treaties out
of]{.mark} a cultural commitment to "negative" or [libertarian]{.mark}
[conceptions of rights or a]{.mark} [cultural aversion]{.mark} to
economic, social, and [cultural rights]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[two
[frequently raised but factually uncompelling]{.mark}
explanations]{.underline}**.35 These are pretexts for other interests at
play. 36 Indeed, in its interactions with international treaty bodies,
the United States regularly addresses the "positive" dimensions of its
human rights obligations as well as a wide spectrum of economic, social,
and, cultural rights, 37 as it does in its own domestic legislation. ¶
In this regard, **[it is also useful to note that while the United
States has been slow to ratify many treaties]{.underline}**---due
primarily to the blocking opportunities presented by the fragmentation
of the U.S. political structure---**[virtually all core human rights
treaties have,]{.underline}** since the late 1970s, **[been signed by
the U.S. executive, indicating at least a political commitment to the
rights and obligations enshrined therein and a present, if revocable,
intent to be bound in the future.]{.underline}**38 President Carter
signed the ICESCR, ICCPR, CERD, and the American Convention in 1977 and
CEDAW in 1980. President Reagan signed the Genocide Convention in 1986,
and President Clinton signed the CRC and its two Optional Protocols in
1995 and 2000, respectively. Likewise, the administration of George H.W.
Bush presided over U.S. ratification of the ICCPR in 1992, having urged
Senate consent in 1991, while President Clinton, who presided over U.S.
ratification of the CERD and CAT in 1994 and the ILO Convention 182 in
1999, strongly promoted U.S. ratification of the ICESCR, CEDAW, and CRC
from the beginning of his administration in 1993.39 The administration
of George W. Bush, moreover, not only presided over the ratification of
the two optional protocols to the CRC in 2002, but, after an initial
decision to step back from the negotiation process, reinitiated active
engagement in the final stages of the substantive drafting of the newly
adopted U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 40
It did so under active pressure from both domestic constituencies 41 and
members of the U.S. House of Representatives. 42 CEDAW, for its part,
has consistently garnered strong, even bipartisan, support in Congress,
with Senate Democratic leaders committing in 2008 to bring it to a full
Senate vote as soon as politically opportune. Although likely to face
intense targeted opposition from anti-abortion lobbies, which by
continuing to politicize it in absolutist terms may succeed in blocking
it still, it is expected to receive supermajority support.¶ **[This
treaty-related behavior, from Republican and Democratic administrations
alike, suggests two important conclusions]{.underline}**. First**[, it
suggests that, despite popular rhetoric to the contrary, the United
States does not in principle perceive inherent contradictions between
such regimes and U.S.]{.underline}** domestic law, **[policy, or
interests]{.underline}**. If it did, such treaties would neither be
signed by the President nor ratified by Senate supermajorities. Second,
**[given the established track record of speedy human rights treaty
ratification]{.underline}** with Democratic control of the Senate and
Executive, **[it can be concluded that [the nation's political branches
reasonably anticipate being subject to]{.mark} [h]{.mark}uman
[ri]{.mark}ghts [treaty regimes as an inevitable outcome of]{.mark}
swings in [the political process]{.mark}]{.underline}**.43 Within this
context, **[[any view that says]{.mark} that [the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates institutionally or "culturally" [resists
human rights]{.mark} commitments [appears
incomplete]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### War\-\--A2: Arms Sales Not Key

#### U.S. Arms sales increase tensions and intensify conflicts

Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First, arms sales can make conflict
more
likely.[^79^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor079)
This may occur because recipients of new weapons feel more confident
about launching attacks or because changes in the local balance of power
can fuel tensions and promote preventive strikes by others. **[A study
of arms sales from 1950 to 1995, for example, found that although arms
sales appeared to have some restraining effect on major-power allies,
they had the opposite effect in other cases, and concluded that
"increased [arms transfers]{.mark} from major powers [make
states]{.mark} significantly [more likely to be militarized dispute
initiators]{.mark}]{.underline}**."[^80^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor080)
Another study focused on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to 1997 found that
"arms transfers are significant and positive predictors of increased
probability of
war."[^81^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor081)
Recent history provides supporting evidence for these findings: **[since
2011, [Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, the leading buyer of American weapons, [has
intervened]{.mark} to varying degrees [in Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, and
Qatar]{.mark}. Second, arms [sales]{.mark} can also [prolong and
intensify]{.mark} ongoing [conflicts and erode]{.mark} rather than
promote regional [stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Few]{.mark}
governments, and fewer insurgencies, [have large enough weapons stocks
to fight]{.mark} for long [without
resupply]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[^82^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor082)
The tendency of external powers to arm the side they support, however
understandable strategically, has the inevitable result of
**[[allowing]{.mark} the conflict to continue at [a higher level of
intensity]{.mark} than would otherwise be the case]{.underline}**. As
one study of arms sales to Africa notes, "**[[Weapons imports are
essential]{.mark} additives in this recipe [for armed conflict and
carnage]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."[^83^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor083)]{.mark}
**[Third]{.underline}**, this dynamic appears to be particularly
troublesome with respect to internal conflicts. Jennifer Erickson, for
example, found that **[[recipients]{.mark} of major conventional weapons
[are 70 percent more likely to engage]{.mark} [in internal
conflicts]{.mark} than other states]{.underline}**. Though halting arms
sales alone is not a panacea for peace and stability, **[arms [embargoes
can]{.mark} help [lessen]{.mark} the [destructiveness]{.mark} of combat
[in both civil and interstate wars simply]{.mark} by restricting access
to the means of
violence]{.underline}**.[^84^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor084)
[]{.mark}**[Finally, because of their effects on both interstate and
internal conflict, arms sales can also erode rather than promote
regional stability.]{.underline}** As noted in the previous section,
**[[where the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates seeks to manage
regional balances of power, [arms sales often create tension]{.mark},
whether [because]{.mark} the [America]{.mark}n role in the region
[threatens others or]{.mark} because American [clients feel
emboldened]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The [Middle East]{.mark}, for
example, has [seesawed between violence]{.mark} and tense standoffs
[for]{.mark} the past [many decades]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at first
because of Cold War competition and more recently **[because of the
American war on terror]{.underline}**. The notion that increased U.S.
arms sales since 9/11 made the Middle East more stable is far-fetched to
say the least. Similarly, **[though many argue that American security
commitments to countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have
produced greater stability, there is a strong case to be made that the
opposite is now true]{.underline}**. **[American [support of South Korea
has driven North Korea to develop nuclear weapons]{.mark}; the [presence
of U.S. missile defense systems in South Korea]{.mark} has [aggravated
China]{.mark}, and [American support of Taiwan produces]{.mark}
continual [tension between the two]{.mark}
powers.[85](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor085)]{.underline}**

Regime Effects. Finally**[, arms [sales]{.mark} can also [have
deleterious effects on recipient nations]{.mark} --- [promoti]{.mark}ng
government [oppression]{.mark}, [instability]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
military [coups.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As part of the war on drugs,
America inadvertently enabled the practice of forced disappearances.
**[In the cases of Colombia, the Philippines, and Mexico, American
[weapons feed a]{.mark} dangerous [cycle of corruption and
oppression]{.mark} involving the police, the military, and political
leaders]{.underline}**.[^94^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor094)
Though the United States provides weapons to Mexico ostensibly for
counternarcotics operations, **[the [arms transferred]{.mark} to the
country often end up being [used]{.mark} by police [to oppress
citizens]{.mark}, [reinforc]{.mark}ing the "climate of [generalized
violence]{.mark} in the country \[that\] carries with it grave
consequences for the rule of
law.]{.underline}**"[^95^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor095)
Similarly, in Colombia and the Philippines the United States has
supplied arms in an effort to support governments against external
threats or internal factions and to combat drug trafficking, but with
mixed results. **[A study of military aid to Colombia found that
"[in]{.mark} environments such as [Colombia]{.mark}, international
military [assistance]{.mark} can [strengthen armed]{.mark} nonstate
[actors]{.mark}, who rival the government over the use of
violence."[96](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor096)
Recent research reveals that]{.underline}** American assistance
programs, like **[foreign military officer training, can increase the
likelihood of military coups]{.underline}**. **[[U.S. training
programs]{.underline}]{.mark}** frequently bought by other nations, most
notably International Military Education and Training (IMET), **[[gave
formal training to]{.mark} the leaders of [the 2009 Honduran
coup]{.mark}, the [2012 Mali coup, and the 2013 Egyptian
coup]{.mark}.[97](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor097)]{.underline}**
In these cases, the **[training that was supposed to stabilize the
country provided military leaders with the tools to overthrow the
government]{.underline}** they were meant to support.

### War\-\--A2: No War

#### Internal instability goes nuclear

**Ramberg 16** \[Bennett Ramberg, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins, J.D. UCLA,
former policy analyst in the US State Department\'s Bureau of
Politico-Military Affairs under President George H.W. Bush 9-10-2016
http://jordantimes.com/opinion/bennett-ramberg/nuclear-weapons-civil-war-zones\]

The world's nine **[nuclear powers]{.underline}** **[claim that there is
little to worry about.]{.underline}**

**[They]{.underline}** **[argue]{.underline}** that the combination of
**[physical protection]{.underline}** and, in most cases, **[electronic
safeguards]{.underline}** (permissive action links, or PALs)
**[means]{.underline}** that their **[arsenals]{.underline}** would
**[remain secure]{.underline}**, **[even if countries]{.underline}**
**[where they are stored]{.underline}** **[or deployed]{.underline}**
**[were engulfed by violence]{.underline}**.

Robert **[Peurifoy]{.underline}**, **[a former senior weapons engineer
at Sandia National Laboratories, disagrees]{.underline}**.

He recently told the Los Angeles Times that such safeguards --- earlier
versions of which he helped design --- may only delay terrorists in
using seized nuclear weapons.

"Either you keep custody or you should expect a mushroom cloud."

Peurifoy's **[statements]{.underline}** have rightly
**[raised]{.underline}** [**[concerns]{.underline}**
**[about]{.underline}**]{.mark} the **[[security of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** stockpiled **[[in insecure
regions]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Consider **[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has **[[the world's
fastest-growing]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
**[[suffers]{.underline}]{.mark}** relentless jihadist terrorism and
**[[separatist violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Attacks have already
been carried out on Pakistani military installations reportedly housing
nuclear components.

The country's new mobile "battlefield nuclear weapons" --- easier to
purloin --- augment current fears.

North Korea, with its volatile and mercurial regime, is another source
of concern.

Suspicious of the military, Kim Jong-un's government has repeatedly
purged senior officers, which has surely stoked opposition that someday
could spark serious civil strife.

Adding nuclear weapons to that mix would be highly dangerous.

**[While]{.underline}** **[other]{.underline}** **[nuclear
powers]{.underline}** **[appear stable]{.underline}**,
**[countries]{.underline}** **[like]{.underline}**
[**[China]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[Russia]{.underline}**]{.mark}, which rely increasingly on
authoritarianism, could **[[face]{.underline}]{.mark}** their own
**[[risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[should]{.mark} political [cohesion
fray]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Of course, there are plenty of examples of security enduring strife. The
1961 revolt of the generals in French Algeria, which placed a nuclear
test device in the Sahara at risk, produced no dangerous incidents.

In China, the government effectively protected nuclear weapon sites
threatened by Revolutionary Guards during the Cultural Revolution. And
neither the attempted coup against Mikhail Gorbachev nor the Soviet
collapse resulted in a loss of control over the country's nuclear
arsenal.

But **[[it is a leap to presume]{.underline}]{.mark}** that these
precedents mean that **[[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} will [remain
safe]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially [**[in]{.underline}**
**[unstable countries]{.underline}**]{.mark} like Pakistan and North
Korea.

**[Nuclear bombs]{.underline}** or materials risk being [**[controlled
by]{.underline}** **[rebels]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[[terrorist]{.mark} group[s]{.mark}, [or]{.mark}]{.underline}** even
**[[failing]{.mark} and desperate]{.underline}**
**[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And, in those cases, the
international community **[has few options for mitigating]{.underline}**
the threat.

[**[External powers can]{.underline}**,]{.mark} for example, launch a
targeted **[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like the one that Israel
carried out on suspected reactors under construction in Iraq and Syria.

Those strikes would not have succeeded had Israel not been able to
identify the targets accurately. Indeed, though the existence of Iraq's
Osirak plant was public knowledge, uncovering Syria's Al Kibar plant was
an intelligence coup.

Carrying out such a strike on North Korean or Pakistani nuclear sites in
a time of crisis would require a similar breakthrough --- one that may
be even more difficult to achieve, given extensive concealment efforts.

Stealthy movement of bombs or materials amid the unrest would further
complicate targeting.

Another option --- invasion and occupation --- avoids the challenge of
identifying nuclear sites.

The defeat of Nazi Germany permitted the Allies to find and destroy the
country's nascent nuclear programme. The 2003 invasion of Iraq granted
the US unfettered access to all possible sites where weapons of mass
destruction could be stored.

**[[But]{.mark} the costs were huge]{.underline}**. Likewise,
**[invasion]{.underline}** and occupation of either North Korea or
Pakistan **[would require massive armies]{.underline}**
**[[risk]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** a **[bitter]{.underline}**
**[conventional]{.underline}** [**[war]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[possible [use of the
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[against the invaders]{.underline}**.

A third option is nuclear containment, which relies on several measures.

First, in order to prevent nuclear migration, all land, sea, and air
routes out of the country in question would have to be controlled, and
homeland security near and far would have to be strengthened.

While the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is already in place to
stop the smuggling of nuclear contraband worldwide, the International
Atomic Energy Agency reports continued trafficking of small amounts of
nuclear material. An increase in monitoring may reduce, but still not
eliminate the problem.

Containment also requires nuclear custodians be persuaded to risk their
lives to defend nuclear sites against terrorists or rebels. And it
demands that states neighbouring the country in question put ballistic
missile defences on alert.

**[While India, South Korea, and Japan continue to modernise such
systems, no missile defence is perfect.]{.underline}**

**[[In]{.mark} a time of [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[when]{.underline}** the **[[facts]{.mark} on the ground [change
fast]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and [fear]{.mark} [clouds
thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[mitigating]{.mark} the nuclear
threat [is no easy feat]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

While concerned governments do have confidential contingency planning in
place, such **[planning has a mixed record when it comes
to]{.underline}** **[responding to]{.underline}** recent
**[international upsets]{.underline}** in the Middle East.

And **[simply hoping]{.underline}** that things will go according to
plan, and nuclear **[command and control will stick,]{.underline}**
**[remains a gamble.]{.underline}**

#### Those conflicts [escalate]{.underline} -- global nuclear war

**Hardy 14** -- James Hardy, Asia-Pacific Editor of IHS Jane's Defence
Weekly, "5 Places Where World War Three Could Break Out", The National
Interest, 10-17,
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/5-places-where-world-war-three-could-break-out-11487?page=show

It seems these days **[[the world is]{.mark} literally [on fire.
Conflict continues]{.mark}]{.underline}** on and off **[[in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, there are tensions throughout the
**[[Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}**-Pacific, Ebola is on the rampage, ISIS
continues its bloody war of attrition **[throughout [Syria]{.mark}, into
[Iraq]{.mark} and on [and on]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet, could
something even worse be on the horizon---a conflict with more-severe
global ramifications?

Before we begin this foray into the five places where **[[World War
Three could break out]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I should note a few
qualifiers and weasel words.

First off, what's World War Three? As illustrated by the Ukraine crisis
and the Obama administration's struggle to define what is going on in
Syria/Northern Iraq, "20th-Century Industrial War" is out of fashion and
has been for some time.

Some of the predictions below envisage regime collapse that leads to
war, while the specter of a terrorist WMD attack has the capacity to
turn apocalyptic very quickly. That said, this might just be a phase:
state-on-state violence will still be theoretically and practically
possible as long as nation-states possess the means to expend blood and
treasure.

That's why most of the predictions below examine the possibility of
conventional strike and counterstrike between nations. **[[No
nuclear]{.mark}-armed [power]{.mark}---whether]{.underline}** it is
**[the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
**[[China or Russia---would accept defeat]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a
peer competitor **[in conventional warfare without]{.underline}** then
**[inflicting the maximum penalty]{.underline}** on its opponent.

That is one very good reason why World War Three as we know it is
unlikely to happen; it is also why all of the possibilities mentioned
below involve nuclear-armed---or potentially nuclear-armed---entities.

North Korea vs. the World:

News out of Pyongyang over the last several weeks that Kim Jong-un is
feeling unwell has reminded people that Northeast Asia contains its very
own brand of extremist Kool-Aid drinkers. The smart line on North Korea
is that its "provocations," to use the accepted term, are graduated
steps in a controlled game of escalation that Kim plays to receive
concessions in the form of aid or economic largesse from the
international community.

The current talks between North Korea and Japan over the longstanding
abduction issue are just one particularly cruel variation on this, where
Pyongyang is trying to leverage the political importance of the
abductees in Japan at a moment where both sides are short of allies in
Northeast Asia.

The "provocation" theory works fine until you realize that at the end of
the day, **[[North Korea is]{.underline}]{.mark}** still **[[developing
a nuclear]{.mark}-weapons [program]{.mark}]{.underline}** and mobile
systems to deliver atomic-tipped warheads. Meanwhile, **[South Korea is
building its own]{.underline}** deterrent in the form of the **["kill
chain,"]{.underline}** which ambitiously proposes knocking out
Pyongyang's nuclear weapons before they can leave the ground. Throw in
the fact that China appears to have lost patience---and more
importantly, influence---in North Korea since the purging and execution
of Jang Song Thaek, and the situation on the peninsula becomes a lot
less predictable.

For sure, North Korea's behavior is grounded in the absolute logic of
regime survival. But if Kim dies or can no longer ensure that the
Pyongyang elite benefit from his rule, then all bets are off.

China vs. India (vs. Pakistan)

The border confrontation between **[[India and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}** that was finally de-escalated on September
27 after nearly three weeks is the latest illustration of just how
uneasy relations can be between these two massive neighbors. The recent
arrival of a PLA Navy Type 039 submarine in Sri Lanka---China's
westernmost foray with a submarine---is another sign that Delhi and
Beijing's strategic priorities **[[may clash]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Other than history and bloody-mindedness, there is no real reason why
the two countries would be destined to go to war. China has concluded a
number of successful negotiations with its land neighbors over border
disputes---the Line of Actual Control is the only remaining dispute, in
fact---and India has the strategic position and military power to exert
regional supremacy over the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). The natural
borders of the Himalayas and southeast Asia have created geographical
spheres of influence that should keep both sides happy.

However, Beijing's "all-weather friendship" with Pakistan and its moves
into the Indian Ocean threaten India's regional hegemony, while India's
"Look East" policy is unwelcome to China because it allies Delhi with
Vietnam and Japan. This kind of **[strategic
[competition---along]{.mark} with bad decisions at
[flashpoints]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as Ladakh and
Kashmir---**[[could lead to escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** from which
neither side could step away.

Middle East Imbroglio

The ongoing situation in the **[[Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}**---whether it's the Islamic State, Iraq,
Gaza, Syria, Iran, Israel, Lebanon or the fallout from the Arab
Spring---is so perplexing, confusing, horrific and insurmountable that
the only thing we can say in its favor is that at least it has not led
to World War Three.

For this to happen, the nuclear balance in the region **[[would]{.mark}
have to [go]{.mark} irrevocably [out of kilter]{.mark}.
One]{.underline}** obvious **[way]{.underline}** this could happen:
**[Iran getting the bomb and]{.underline}** in response, **[Israel using
its]{.underline}** "widely suspected **[unmentionables]{.underline}**."

Another possibility deserving more scrutiny than it gets is whether the
Saudis would upgrade their DF-3 ballistic missiles with
DF-21s---something that is heavily rumored---or fit the older, less
accurate DF-3s with nuclear warheads.

Another element of this scenario is the question of which way these
missiles would be pointed---at Iran or Israel?

Other regional wildcards include the North Koreans helping out the Assad
regime, or the Islamic State somehow capturing a previously unknown
stockpile of fissile material and having the brainpower to weaponize it.

In this light, U.S. attempts to prevent Iran from getting the bomb make
even more sense; why it is not equally scrutinizing Saudi Arabia's
intentions in this area, less so.

Russia vs. NATO:

Before the air campaign against the Islamic State took over the news
cycle, the biggest story of the year was what exactly was going to
happen in east Ukraine. The shooting down of an airliner, multiple
border violations by Russian troops and the annexation of Crimea had
added up to force a major reevaluation by the West of its relationship
with Vladimir Putin's Russia.

The speed and intelligence of the Russian campaign bodes ill for NATO
and other multilateral organizations such as the EU, which have been
hamstrung by a committee-led approach to decision making that slows down
their response times.

In fairness to NATO, the alliance is aware of this and has made a number
of attempts to bolster its position in eastern Europe. At the Wales
summit in September, it began to work out of the details of a Readiness
Action Plan that will include very rapid reaction forces and deploying
pre-positioned equipment and supplies along its eastern frontier.

The new force will be in contrast to what IHS Jane's correspondent
Brooks Tigner brilliantly described as "the distinctly un-rapid NATO
Response Force (NRF), which currently needs months to deploy its full
force of 20,000-plus troops and equipment."

NATO also needs to work out a way to win the information war, which
Putin has managed as adeptly as any confrontations on the ground in
Ukraine.

These tactical considerations aside, at the heart of the issue is NATO's
eastward move, which Russia unsurprisingly opposes, and Moscow's
assertion that it had the right to "protect" Russian-speaking minorities
in other countries, which NATO would have to react to if member nations
such as the Baltic states or Poland were threatened.

**[China vs. America (via Taiwan, Japan or the South China
Sea)]{.underline}**

Last and definitely not least, **[the biggest potential conflict of
all]{.underline}**. The threat of the "Thucydides Trap"---that of a
rising power and a preeminent power ending up at war---has become a
notable talking point in Sino-U.S. relations in recent years.

Some analysts argue that Thucydides' analysis of the Sparta-Athens
relationship is a poor analogy for that between China and the United
States. However, it is undeniable that **[China's rise and military
buildup changes the balance of power and dangerously affects enough
points of friction in northeast Asia]{.underline}**.

The most dangerous feature of these friction points is that they involve
third parties: **[the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea,
[Japan, Taiwan or]{.mark} North [Korea could]{.mark} all [spark]{.mark}
a localized [conflict that quickly gets out of
hand]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The most dangerous, in my view, are the
territorial disputes that could be contested in the maritime sphere:
that is, in waters and territories close to China that Beijing claims
and would likely contest if the status quo changed against its
interests.

**[Arms for]{.underline}** (**[Not That Much]{.underline}**)
**[Influence]{.underline}**. Successful foreign policy involves
encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit the United
States. As noted, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has often attempted to use arms sales to
generate]{.underline}** the sort of **[leverage or
influence]{.underline}** necessary to do this. **[[History
reveals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[however]{.underline}**, that **[the
[benefits of]{.mark} the [arms for influence]{.mark}
strategy]{.underline}** **[[are limited]{.underline}]{.mark}** for two
main reasons.

First, **[the range of cases in which arms sales can produce useful
leverage is much narrower than is often imagined]{.underline}**. Most
obviously, **[arms [sales are unnecessary]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
situations **[[where the other country]{.mark} already
[agrees]{.mark}]{.underline}** or complies **[[with the American
position]{.underline}]{.mark}** or can be encouraged to do so without
such incentives. **[This]{.underline}** category
**[includes]{.underline}** **[most]{.underline}** **[U.S. allies and
close partners under]{.underline}** **[many]{.underline}**, though not
all, **[circumstances]{.underline}**.

**[Just as clearly]{.underline}**, the **[[arms for
influence]{.underline}]{.mark}** strategy [**[is a]{.underline}**
**[nonstarter]{.underline}** **[when the other state will
never]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[agree to [comply]{.mark} with American
demands. [This]{.mark}]{.underline}** category
**[[includes]{.underline}]{.mark}** a small group of **[obvious
cases]{.underline}** **[such as [Russia, China, Iran,
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** other potential [**[adversaries (to which
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[does not]{.mark} [sell]{.mark}
weapons [anyway]{.mark}]{.underline}**), **[but [it also includes
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[much [larger group]{.mark} of
cases]{.underline}** **[[in which the]{.mark} other [state opposes what
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[wants]{.mark}, [or in which complying]{.mark}]{.underline}** with
U.S. wishes **[[would be politically]{.mark} too [dangerous]{.mark} for
that state's leadership]{.underline}**.59

**[In addition]{.underline}**, **[[there are]{.underline}]{.mark}** some
**[[cases]{.mark} in which [the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
itself **[[would view]{.mark} arms sales [as]{.mark}]{.underline}** an
**[[inappropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}** tool. **[The [Leahy]{.mark}
Law,]{.underline}** for example, **[[bars]{.mark} the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[from providing
security [assistance to any]{.mark}]{.underline}** specific **[foreign
[military]{.mark}]{.underline}** unit deemed **[[responsible
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** past human **[rights
[abuses]{.mark}]{.underline}**.60 **[More broadly]{.underline}**,
**[arms [sales are]{.mark}]{.underline}** clearly a
**[[risky]{.underline}]{.mark}** choice **[[when the
recipient]{.underline}]{.mark}** state **[[is]{.mark} a [failed]{.mark}
state [or]{.mark}]{.underline}** when it is **[engaged
[in]{.mark}]{.underline}** a civil conflict or interstate
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, **[[in such cases it is]{.mark}
often [unclear whether there is anyone to negotiate]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} in the first place, and governments are at best on shaky
ground]{.underline}**. At present **[the]{.underline}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[bars]{.underline}** **[17 such nations]{.underline}** **[from
purchasing]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[American [arms. As long as these
nations are embargoed]{.mark}, arms [sales will remain]{.mark} an
[irrelevant]{.mark} option [for]{.mark} exerting
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.61

**[Apart from these cases, [there is a]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[large
group]{.mark} of nations]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}**
**[tiny]{.underline}** **[defense budgets [that]{.mark} simply [don't
buy enough]{.mark} major conventional weaponry to provide much
incentive]{.underline}** for arms sales. **[On this list are as many
as]{.underline}** **[[112 countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that
[purchased less than \$100 million]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
**[arms]{.underline}** from the United States between 2002 and 2016,
**[including Venezuela, Jamaica, and Sudan. Lest this category be
dismissed because it includes mostly smaller and less strategically
significant countries]{.underline}** from the American perspective,
**[it should be noted that [each]{.mark} of these countries [has a vote
in the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}** **[(and
other]{.underline}** international **[organizations) and
that]{.underline}** **[many]{.underline}** of them **[suffer from civil
conflicts and terrorism, making them potential targets of
interest]{.underline}** **[for American policymakers looking for
international influence.]{.underline}**

**[By definition]{.underline}**, **[then]{.underline}**, the
**[arms-for-influence]{.underline}** strategy **[is]{.underline}**
**[limited]{.underline}** to cases in which a currently noncompliant
country might be willing to change its policies (at least for the right
price or to avoid punishment).

Proliferation, after all, means rapid spread. And whereas nuclear
weapons have proliferated "vertically", with existing nuclear states
adding to their existing nuclear arsenals, **[[there has not
been]{.mark} a "[horizontal]{.mark}" nuclear weapons
[prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** -- that is, **[a fast spread of
these weapons to new nations]{.underline}**. **[On the
contrary]{.underline}**, **[nuclear [weapons]{.mark} have [spread
slowly]{.mark}]{.underline}** across the world, **[even though
academics, politicians and the media frequently discuss horizontal
nuclear weapons proliferation as if it was a matter of
fact]{.underline}**. **[[Reality check]{.mark}]{.underline}** Currently,
**[there are only nine states]{.underline}** in the world **[with
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** among the UN's 193 members: the US (since
1945), Russia (since 1949), the UK (since 1952), France (since 1960),
China (since 1964), Israel (since 1966, unofficial), India (since 1974),
Pakistan (since 1998) and North Korea (since 2006). Other **[countries
have dropped off the list]{.underline}**. **[[South
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}** joined the nuclear club in the 1980s, but
**[[dismantled]{.underline}]{.mark}** its weapons in the early 1990s.
**[[Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine]{.mark} i]{.underline}**nherited
nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union when they became independent
states after the Cold War, but they **[[transferred]{.mark} their
nuclear arsenal to Russia]{.underline}** in the 1990s. In other words,
only a handful of countries in Europe, Asia and North America possess
these weapons, while Africa, Australasia and Latin America are devoid of
nuclear weapons states. In fact, **[[the number]{.mark} of nuclear
weapons states [has]{.mark} [actually decreased]{.mark} ever since the
1990s]{.underline}**. **[And even though]{.underline}** the Pakistani
nuclear weapons scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan confirmed **[the existence
of a global nuclear]{.underline}** **[black market]{.underline}** which
purportedly provided nuclear technology, expertise, and designs to
various countries, including Libya, **[no horizontal nuclear weapons
proliferation has taken place.]{.underline}** **[Libya]{.underline}**
eventually voluntarily **[renounced its secret nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** **[efforts]{.underline}** in December 2003.
**[[Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan]{.mark} have also
[shelved]{.mark} their nuclear weapons programs]{.underline}**. As of
now, there are 31 countries with nuclear power plant units in operation;
countries such as Australia, Canada, and Japan are widely believed to
have the technological sophistication to become nuclear weapons states
in relatively short amount of time should they want to -- but they have
not pursued that path. In other words, **[even though there have been
opportunities]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** nuclear weapons
**[proliferation]{.underline}** **[across a range of new
states,]{.underline}** **[[such]{.mark} [a development has not
materialised]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[All]{.mark} of the available
[evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus
**[[unanimously]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[no]{.mark} horizontal
nuclear weapons [prolif]{.mark}eration has taken place throughout the 70
years that these weapons have existed]{.underline}**. **[[Claims to the
contrary]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[lack basis]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
whether they are **[[made for]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[political or
economic reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[sheer
ignorance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or for any other purposes.
**[[Horizontal]{.mark} nuclear weapons [prolife]{.mark}ration [is
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[bogeyman that does not
exist]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If we are to devise sound strategies and
policies regarding nuclear weapons we have to ground them in existing
reality. Recognising that **[there is no horizontal nuclear weapons
proliferation]{.underline}** is a good place to start.

International Research, \"The Nuclear Domino Myth,\", Foreign Affairs,

<http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66738/johan-bergenas/the-nuclear-domino-myth>)

[But there\'s [one problem with]{.mark} this [\"nuclear domino\"]{.mark}
scenario[: the **historical record** does not support
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the dawn of the nuclear age,
[[many]{.mark} have [fear]{.mark}ed [rapid]{.mark} and widespread
nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}; [[65 years later, **only
nine** countries have]{.mark} developed nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nearly 20 years elapsed between the
emergence of the first nuclear state, the United States, in 1945, and
the fifth, China, in 1964.¶ The [next 40 years gave birth to only
five]{.underline} additional [nuclear countries]{.underline}: India,
Israel, South Africa, Pakistan, and North Korea. South Africa
voluntarily disarmed in the 1990s, as did Belarus, Kazakhstan, and
Ukraine following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [[After
Israel]{.underline} [developed]{.underline}]{.mark} a [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} capability in the late 1960s, **[[no regional
nuclear chain reaction followed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even though the
country is surrounded by rivals[. Nor was there even a two-country
nuclear arms race in the region]{.underline}.¶ Similarly[, it has now
been four years since [North Korea became a nuclear weapons state, yet
South Korea and Japan have **not followed suit**]{.mark}, despite the
fact that they have a latent nuclear weapons capability]{.underline} \--
access to the fissile material necessary for nuclear weapons. These
countries\' decisions to not go nuclear are largely [thanks
to]{.underline} extensive U.S. efforts to dissuade them. Both South
Korea and Japan enjoy firm and long-standing security assurances from
Washington, [including protection under the U.S.]{.underline} strategic
nuclear [umbrella]{.underline}, obviating the need for their own
deterrents.

### A2: Turn\-\--Prolif\-\--Ext\-\--Leverage Fails

#### Leverage theory is [wrong]{.underline} -- aid [doesn't spur coop]{.underline}

**Lam 19**\-\-\-- Sophie Lam, 4/9/19 contributing article to The Gate
("Ending US Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,"
<http://uchicagogate.com/articles/2019/4/9/ending-us-arms-sales-saudi-arabia/>)
BJRC

**[While [the US]{.mark} government [suggests]{.mark} that [arms sales
incline Saudi Arabia to cooperate]{.mark} with the US' agenda, [the
reverse is true]{.mark}. Rather than the United States gaining leverage
through arms sales, Saudi Arabia has gained more power instead. Patricia
[Sullivan]{.mark} of Foreign Policy Analysis [writes that]{.mark},
empirically, [states that receive military aid are less cooperative than
states that do not]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[States that receive
military aid are willing to take advantage of their leverage because the
US often refrains from holding allied states completely accountable to
their commitments or to American principles.]{.underline}**]{.mark}
Khashoggi's murder casts a long shadow in that regard: Trump has chosen
to turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's blatant disregard for civil
liberties in the professed service of protecting America's economy.
Though not anywhere near as powerful as the US, Saudi Arabia has escaped
the Khashoggi situation with its US arms deals intact.

#### Aid causes less cooperation, sales don't cause increase in leverage

**[[What can states expect to receive]{.mark} in return [for]{.mark} the
[military aid]{.mark} they provide [to other
states]{.mark}?]{.underline}** **[[Can military]{.mark} aid [buy
recipient]{.mark} state [compliance with donor]{.mark}
objectives[?]{.mark}]{.underline}** In this study, we systematically
investigate the effects of US military assistance on recipient state
behavior toward the United States. We build on existing literature by
creating three explicit theoretical models, employing a new measure of
cooperation generated from events data, and controlling for preference
similarity, so that our results capture the influence military aid has
on recipient state behavior independent of any dyadic predisposition
toward cooperation or conflict. We test seven hypotheses using a
combination of simultaneous equation, cross-sectional time series, and
Heckman selection models. **[[We find that]{.mark}, with limited
exceptions, [increasing levels of US]{.mark} military [aid]{.mark}
significantly [reduce coop]{.mark}erative foreign policy behavior [with
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}** US reaction to
recipient state behavior is also counterintuitive; instead of using a
carrot-and-stick approach to military aid allocations, our results show
that recipient state cooperation is likely to lead to subsequent
reductions in US military assistance.

### A2: Turn\-\--Prolif\-\--Ext\-\--No Impact

#### Prolif is slow, won't happen, and has no impact -- reject their evidence

**Keck 13** (Zachary, Associate Editor of The Diplomat, 12/4/13, "Why
Nuclear Weapons Don\'t Spread (Quickly)", The Diplomat,
http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/why-nuclear-weapons-dont-spread-quickly/)

Cartwright is hardly alone in holding these views. Indeed, the general
consensus when it comes to nuclear weapons has long been "when there's a
will there's a way." And yet, [the [spread of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [has]{.mark} always [been]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[surprisingly [slow]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover,
[[despite]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[diffusion of]{.underline}]{.mark}
nuclear [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, [nuclear weapons
have]{.underline} actually [been]{.underline} [spreading]{.underline}
[much more slowly than they did during the first]{.underline} [few
decades of the nuclear era.]{.underline}

Consider that, [in the three decades following]{.underline} the atomic
bombings of [Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.underline}, no less than [seven
countries]{.underline} [developed]{.underline} at least [a nascent
nuclear weapon capability]{.underline}. [[In]{.mark} the]{.underline}
nearly [[four decades]{.mark} since]{.underline}, [only [three
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} --- Pakistan, South Africa, and North
Korea --- [have [developed]{.mark}]{.underline} a nuclear weapons
[[capability]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [one]{.mark}]{.underline} of
these states --- South Africa --- [voluntarily [dismantled its
arsenal.]{.mark}]{.underline}

So what explains this great nuclear slowdown? Two converging trends seem
to be at work. First, [there has been an]{.underline} **[undeniable
decline]{.underline}** [in the number of states interested in
acquiring]{.underline} nuclear [weapons]{.underline}. Harald
[[Muller]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} Andreas
[[Schmidt]{.underline}]{.mark} have [documented this]{.underline} well.
[In their]{.underline} **[[comprehensive study]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of states with]{.underline} nuclear [weapons activities
between]{.underline} 19**[45]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
20**[05]{.underline}**, [they [find]{.mark} that]{.underline} "[[states
with nuclear weapons activities]{.mark} were]{.underline} **[always a
minority]{.underline}**, [and today they [are the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[smallest minority]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1945." Specifically,
in 2005 [they identified 10 [states]{.mark} as [having nuclear
weapons]{.mark} activities]{.underline} (including those with nuclear
weapons), [which [constitute]{.mark}d]{.underline} [**[less than six
percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [UN]{.underline}]{.mark}
[members]{.underline}. Today the only non-nuclear weapon state (NNWS)
that might be interested in an atomic weapon is Iran.

The fact that [[states have]{.underline}]{.mark} **[by and large [been
uninterested]{.mark} in nuclear weapons]{.underline}** is somewhat
perplexing from a historic perspective. After all, what other
revolutionary military technology hasn't elicited strong interest from
most states competing in the international system?

At the same time, when one examines the properties of nuclear weapons
more closely, the lack of interest is easier to understand. [Nuclear
weapons]{.underline} have basically [served one purpose]{.underline} for
states possessing them; namely, [they]{.underline} have [deterred
others]{.underline} from challenging that state's survival and other
fundamental interests. But the [nuclear era has]{.underline} also [been
characterized by a sharp decline in warfare]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} today [fewer]{.underline} [states]{.underline}
[face]{.underline} fundamental external [threats]{.underline} to their
existence. Given the high costs of building and maintaining a nuclear
arsenal, it makes little sense to acquire nuclear weapons without such
an existential threat.

While lack of interest explains why some states have renounced nuclear
weapons despite possessing the capability to build them, the
[[difficulty]{.underline} [in building them]{.underline}]{.mark} [has
[prevented]{.mark} others [states]{.mark} [that
seek]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[weapons]{.mark} from acquiring
them]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} the view that "[where there is
a will there's a way," and]{.underline} a strong sense that
[globalization]{.underline} has exacerbated this, the [historical record
tells]{.underline} [a]{.underline} very [different story.]{.underline}

As Jacques Hymans has pointed out, before 1970 seven countries launched
dedicated nuclear weapon programs and all seven succeeded in an average
of seven years. Since 1970, [ten states have launched dedicated nuclear
weapons [programs]{.mark} and only three]{.underline} have
[succeeded]{.underline} (the jury's still out on Iran).
[These]{.underline} three have [[take]{.underline}]{.mark}n an [average
of [17 years to succeed]{.mark}]{.underline} and [Iran]{.underline}
under the Islamic Republic [has been working towards a]{.underline}
nuclear [weapon]{.underline} capability [for]{.underline} some [three
decades.]{.underline}

Just as [[pundits]{.underline}]{.mark} have [routinely]{.underline}
[[underestimate]{.underline}d]{.mark} [the [difficulty]{.mark} of
building]{.underline} nuclear [weapons]{.underline}, so too do
[they]{.underline} [[grossly]{.mark} [overstate]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[number of [states]{.mark}]{.underline} who are [technically [capable of
building them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both journalists and scholars
regularly cite 40 as the number of non-nuclear weapon states who are
technically capable of building them. This figure is often attributed to
the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
Mohamed ElBaradei, who said in 2004:

"Some estimates indicate that 40 countries or more now have the know-how
to produce nuclear weapons, which means if they have the required
fissile material --- high enriched uranium or plutonium --- we are
relying primarily on the continued good intentions of these countries."

As Scott Sagan has pointed out, most of those citing ElBaradei omit the
latter part of his statement about having the required fissile material.
But this statement is crucial as only a handful of NNWS are capable of
producing or otherwise procuring fissile material, which is necessary
for a nuclear bomb.

Moreover, thanks in no small part to President Obama's focus on nuclear
security, the [global [availability of fissile material has been
declining]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as]{.mark} the U.S. and]{.underline}
its [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} help [remove fissile material
from]{.underline} some [states while [downsizi]{.mark}ng]{.underline}
the [[stockpiles]{.underline}]{.mark} in many others. Furthermore,
compared with the Cold War era and even the 1990s, nuclear weapon
holding and [nuclear capable [states]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[much [less]{.mark} [willing to sell]{.mark}]{.underline} NNWS [crucial
dual use [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology that can be used to
indigenously produce fissile material.

Thus, [contrary to common perception]{.underline}, [[there
is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[no impeding nuclear domino about to
fall.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### [No impact]{.underline} -- prolif empirically doesn't cause war and is slow

**Walt, 12** (Stephen Walt -- Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University, 11/30, Foreign Policy,
"The mother of all worst-case assumptions about Iran",
<http://walt.foreignpolicy.com>
/posts/2012/11/30/the_mother_of_all_worst_case_assumptions_about_iran)

Yet this \"mother of all assumptions\" is simply asserted and rarely
examined. The obvious question to ask is this: [[did]{.mark} [prior acts
of]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [have]{.mark} the same
[fearsome consequences]{.mark} that Iran hawks now forecast? The answer
is [no]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [the spread of nuclear weapons has
had]{.underline} remarkably [little impact on the]{.underline} [basic
nature of world politics]{.underline} and the ranking of major powers.
[[The main effect]{.mark} of the nuclear revolution [has been]{.mark} to
induce **[greater caution]{.mark}** in the behavior of both those who
possessed the bomb and anyone who had to deal with a nuclear-armed
adversary.]{.underline} [[Prolif]{.mark}eration [has not transformed
weak states into]{.mark} influential [global actors]{.mark}, [has not
given]{.mark} nuclear-armed [states the ability to blackmail]{.mark}
their neighbors or force them to kowtow, **[and it has not
triggered]{.mark}** far-reaching regional **[arms
races]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In short, fears that an Iranian bomb would
transform regional or global politics have been greatly exaggerated; one
might even say that they are just a lot of hooey.¶ [[Consider the
historical record]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ Did the world turn on its axis
when the mighty Soviet Union tested its first bomb in 1949? Although
alarmist documents like NSC-68 warned of a vast increase in Soviet
influence and aggressiveness, [[Soviet nuclear
developmen]{.mark}t]{.underline} simply
[[reinforced]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[caution]{.underline}]{.mark}
that both superpowers were already displaying towards each other. The
United States already saw the USSR as an enemy, and the basic principles
of containment were already in place. NATO was being formed before the
Soviet test and Soviet dominance of Eastern Europe was already a fait
accompli. Having sole possession of the bomb hadn\'t enabled Truman to
simply dictate to Stalin, and getting the bomb didn\'t enable Stalin or
his successors to blackmail any of their neighbors or key U.S. allies.
[It certainly didn\'t lead any countries to \"reorient their political
alignment]{.underline} toward Moscow.\" Nikita Khrushchev\'s subsequent
missile rattling merely strengthened the cohesion of NATO and other
U.S.-led alliances, and we now know that much of his bluster was
intended to conceal Soviet strategic inferiority. [Having a large
nuclear arsenal didn\'t stop the anti-commnist uprisings in East
Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, or Poland, and didn\'t allow the
Soviet Union to win in Afghanistan. Nor did it prevent the USSR from
eventually collapsing entirely.¶ Did British and French acquisition of
nuclear weapons slow their decline as great powers? Not in the
slightest]{.underline}. Having the force de frappe may have made De
Gaulle feel better about French prestige and having their own deterrent
made both states less dependent on America\'s security umbrella, but it
didn\'t give either state a louder voice in world affairs or win them
new influence anywhere. And you might recall that Britain couldn\'t get
Argentina to give back the Falklands by issuing nuclear threats \-- even
though Argentina had no bomb of its own and no nuclear guarantee \--
they had to go retake the islands with conventional forces. ¶ [[Did
China\'s detonation of a bomb]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1964 suddenly
[[make them a superpower? Hardly]{.mark}.]{.underline} China remained a
minor actor on the world stage until it adopted market principles, and
[its]{.underline} rising global [influence is due to]{.underline} three
decades of economic [growth]{.underline}, [not]{.underline} a pile of
[nukes]{.underline}. And by the way, [did getting a bomb enable
Mao]{.underline} Zedong\--a cruel megalomaniac who launched the
disastrous Great Leap Forward in 1957 and the destructive Cultural
Revolution in the 1960s [\-- to start threatening and blackmailing his
neighbors? Nope.]{.underline} In fact, China\'s foreign policy behavior
after 1964 was generally quite restrained.¶ What about Israel? [[Does
Israel\'s nuclear arsenal allow it to coerce]{.mark} [its
neighbors]{.mark} or impose its will on Hezbollah or the Palestinians?
[No]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israel uses its conventional military
superiority to try to do these things, not its nuclear arsenal. Indeed,
[Israel\'s bomb didn\'t even prevent Egypt and Syria from attacking it
in]{.underline} October [1973]{.underline}, although it did help
convince them to limit their aims to regaining the territory they had
lost in 1967. It is also worth noting [that Israel\'s nuclear program
did not trigger a rapid arms race either.]{.underline} Although states
like Iraq and Libya did establish their own WMD programs after Israel
got the bomb, none of their nuclear efforts moved very rapidly or made
it across the finish line.¶ But wait, there\'s more. [The white
government in South Africa eventually produced a handful of bombs, but
nobody noticed]{.underline} and apartheid ended anyway. Then the new
government gave up its nuclear arsenal to much acclaim. If anything,
South Africa was more secure without an arsenal than it was before.¶
[W[hat about India and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}? India\'s
\"peaceful nuclear explosion\" in 1974 didn\'t turn it into a global
superpower, and its only real effect was to spur Pakistan \-- which was
already an avowed rival \-- to get one too. And it\'s worth noting that
[[there hasn\'t been a large-scale war]{.mark} between the two countries
[since]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite considerable grievances on both
sides and occasional skirmishes and other provocations.¶ Finally,
[[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} is as annoying and weird as it has
always been, but [getting nuclear weapons [didn\'t transform
it]{.mark}]{.underline} from an economic basket case into a mighty
regional power [and didn\'t make it more inclined to
misbehave]{.underline}. In fact, [what is most remarkable about North
Korea\'s nuclear program is how little impact it has had on its
neighbors.]{.underline} States like [[Japan and South Korea could go
nuclear very quickly]{.underline}]{.mark} if they wanted to, **[[but
neither has done so]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the six years since North
Korea\'s first nuclear test. ¶ In short, [both theory and history teach
us that getting a nuclear weapon has less impact on a country\'s power
and influence than many believe, and [the slow spread of nuclear weapons
has only modest effects on]{.mark} global and regional
[politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}
are good for deterring direct attacks on one\'s homeland, and they
[[induce]{.mark} greater [caution]{.mark} in the minds of national
leaders of all kinds. What they don\'t do is turn weak states into great
powers, they are useless as tools of blackmail, and they cost a lot of
money]{.underline}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[lead]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} to worry
more about one\'s intentions and [[to band together]{.underline}]{.mark}
for self-protection. For these reasons, most potential nuclear states
have concluded that getting the bomb isn\'t worth it.¶ But a few
states-and usually those who are worried about being attacked-decide to
go ahead. The good news is that when they do, it has remarkably little
impact on world affairs.

### A2: Turn\-\--Prolif\-\--Ext\-\--No Prolif

#### Slow proliferation doesn't open the floodgates 

**Waltz 3** (Kenneth, The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed,
2003, p. 42-43)

[Countries have to take care of their own security,]{.underline} if
countries feel insecure and believe that nuclear weapons would make them
more secure, [America's policy of opposing the spread of nuclear weapons
will not prevail.]{.underline} Any slight chance of bringing the spread
of nuclear weapons to a halt exists only if the United States
strenuously tries to achieve that end. To do so carries costs measured
in terms of other interests. The strongest way for the United States to
persuade other countries to forego nuclear weapons is to guarantee their
security. How many states' security do we want to guarantee? Wisely, we
are reluctant to make promises, but then we should not expect to decide
how other countries provide for their security. [[Some]{.mark} have
[fear]{.mark}ed that [weakening opposition to the spread of nuclear
weapons will lead numerous states to obtain them]{.mark} because it may
seem that "everyone is doing it." Why should we think that if we relax,
numerous states will begin to make nuclear weapons? [Both the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and the Soviet Union were
relaxed]{.mark} in the past, [and those effects did not
follow]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Soviet Union initially supported
China's nuclear program. The United States helped both Britain and
France to produce nuclear weapons. By 1968 the CIA had informed
President Johnson of the existence of Israeli nuclear weapons, and in
July of 1970, Richard Helms, director of the CIA, gave this information
to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. These and later disclosures
were not followed by censure of Israel or by reductions of economic
assistance. And in September of 1980, the executive branch, against the
will of the House of Representatives but with the approval of the
Senate, continued to do nuclear business with India despite its
explosion of a nuclear device and despite its unwillingness to sign the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty[. [Many more countries can make nuclear
weapons than do]{.mark}.]{.underline} One can believe that American
opposition to nuclear arming stays the deluge only by overlooking the
complications of international life. Any state has to examine many
conditions before deciding whether or not to develop nuclear weapons.
Our opposition is only one factor and is not likely to be the decisive
one. Many states feel fairly secure living with their neighbors. Why
should they want nuclear weapons? Some countries, feeling threatened,
have found security through their own strenuous efforts and through
arrangements made with others. South Korea is an outstanding example.
Many officials believe that South Korea would lose more in terms of
American support if it acquired nuclear weapons than it would gain by
having them. Further, on occasion we might slow the spread of nuclear
weapons by not opposing the nuclear weapons programs of some countries.
When we opposed Pakistan's nuclear program, we were saying that we
disapprove of countries developing nuclear weapons no matter what their
neighbors do. [[The gradual spread of nuclear weapons has not opened the
nuclear floodgates.]{.mark} Nations attend to their security in the ways
they think best.]{.underline} The fact that so many more countries can
make nuclear weapons than do says more about the hesi­tation of countries
to enter the nuclear military business than about the effectiveness of
American nonproliferation policy. [We should suit our policy to
individual cases,]{.underline} sometimes bringing pressure against a
country moving toward nuclear weapons capability and sometimes quietly
acquiescing: No one policy is right in all cases. We should ask what the
inter­ests of other countries require before putting pressure on them.
Some countries are likely to suffer more in cost and pain if they remain
conventional states than if they become nuclear ones. [The measured
spread of nuclear weapons does not run against our interests and can
increase the security of some states]{.underline} at a price they can
afford to pay.

Nor is the process designed to correct problems. On one hand, end-use
violations can result in individuals and companies being prevented from
making future purchases. On the other hand, **[there is [no evidence
that]{.mark} end-use [monitoring has changed]{.mark} the pattern of
American arms [sales]{.mark} in any way.]{.underline}** **[The
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in truth [has]{.mark} little or [no
control over]{.mark} what happens to [the weapons it sells to other
nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The result is that year after year
weapons of all kinds end up falling into the hands of unreliable, risky,
or just plain bad actors, at which point they're used in ways neither
the United States nor its customers intended. **[[American
weapons]{.mark} have [frequently]{.mark} wound up being [used against
Americans]{.mark} in combat]{.underline}**. And even more often, local
and regional actors, including criminal gangs, have employed them in
their own conflicts. **[In civil wars, regime collapse, or other extreme
cases, factions steal weapons and use them for their own purposes, as
ISIS did in
Iraq.[90](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor090)]{.underline}**
Iraq, as previously noted, provides an excellent case study in the
inability of the United States to prevent dispersion. As part of U.S.
efforts to rebuild Iraq's military and security capabilities after the
2003 invasion, the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [sent Iraq]{.mark}
roughly [\$2.5 billion worth of]{.mark} American [weapons through
2014]{.mark}, including everything from small arms to "armored personnel
carriers, military helicopters, transport aircraft, anti-tank missiles,
tanks, artillery and drones."
[91](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor091)]{.underline}**
Despite the presence of thousands of U.S. troops in-country and the very
close relationship between those troops and their Iraqi counterparts,
**[[many]{.mark} of those weapons [went missing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Between **[2003 and 2008 alone, [360,000]{.mark} out of 1 million [small
arms disappeared]{.mark}, along with 2,300 Humvees]{.underline}**. A
sizable chunk of **[[this weaponry would]{.mark} later [end up in the
hands of ISIS]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[[Iraqi]{.mark}
army]{.underline}**, trained and equipped by the American military,
dissolved when faced by ISIS and **[[left their weapons]{.mark} behind
[for the terrorist group to pick up]{.mark} and use for conquering and
holding territory]{.underline}**. A UN Security Council report found
that in June 2014 alone "ISIS seized sufficient Iraqi **[[government
stocks]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the provinces of Anbar and Salah
al-Din **[to [arm and equip]{.mark} more than [three]{.mark} Iraqi
conventional [army
divisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**."[^92^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor092)
**[Data collected by Conflict Armament Research

stocks.[^93^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor093)
In short, **[dispersion]{.underline}** enabled the spread of ISIS and

Moreover, [even if one believed that the benefits would outweigh the
potential costs, [arms sales]{.mark} still [have]{.mark} almost [no
value]{.mark} as a tool [in the war on terror]{.mark} for several
reasons. First, [the bulk of arms sales]{.mark} (and those we considered

terrorism.]{.underline} Many U**[.S. arms deals since 9/11 have involved

but **[[of little use in fighting terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

from the past 16 years [that direct military intervention]{.mark} is
[the]{.mark} right [way to combat terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Research reveals that [military force]{.mark} alone "[seldom ends
terrorism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**"50 This comports with the American
experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the war on terror to
date. Despite regime change, thousands of air strikes, and efforts to
upgrade the military capabilities of friendly governments, **[the United
States has not only failed to destroy the threat of Islamist-inspired
terrorism, it has also spawned chaos, greater resentment, and a sharp
increase in the level of terrorism afflicting the nations
involved.]{.underline}**51 Given the experience of the United States
since 2001, there is little reason to expect that additional arms sales
to countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, or the United Arab
Emirates will reduce terrorism, much less anti-American terrorism
specifically. Relatedly, **[many [arms deals since 9/11,]{.mark} made in
the name of counterterrorism, [were irrelevant to U.S. goals]{.mark} in
the global war on terror [because they provided weapons to
governments]{.mark} fighting terrorist groups only vaguely (if at all)
[linked to al Qaeda or ISIS]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Although selling
weapons to the governments of Nigeria or Morocco or Tunisia might help
them combat violent resistance in their countries, terrorist groups in
those countries have never targeted the United States. As a result, such
arms deals cannot be justified by arguing that they advance the goals of
the United States in its own war on terror in any serious way.
**[Finally, [arms sales are]{.mark} completely [useless to
combat]{.mark} the largest terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland ---
lone wolf [attackers]{.mark} already [living in the United
States]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As noted, none of the successful attacks
in the United States since 9/11 resulted from operations directed by al
Qaeda or ISIS. And in fact only two foiled attempts since then --- the
underwear bomber and the printer-bomb plot --- can be ascribed to al
Qaeda.52 Instead, in almost all cases, **[persons already living in the
United States, inspired by Islamist groups, decided to carry out attacks
on their own.]{.underline}** Clearly, **[arms sales to foreign nations
won't help with that problem; rather, as many analysts have suggested,
amplifying conflicts abroad may well make the problem
worse]{.underline}**.53 In sum, **[[the strategic value of arms
sales]{.mark} for the United States [is very low]{.mark} given today's
security environment. Different circumstances would produce a different
analysis.]{.underline}** Although today there is little reason for the
United States to worry about the Russian threat to Europe, during the
Cold War foreign policy experts agreed that preventing the Soviet Union
from dominating the European continent was critical to American
security. As a result, the United States sensibly provided NATO allies
with advanced weapons. This strategy greatly enhanced the fighting
capability of NATO, thereby bolstering deterrence and ensuring European
security.

At the strategic level, **[[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[inhabits]{.mark} such [a]{.mark}n extremely [favorable security
environment]{.mark} in the post-Cold War world that most [arms sales
do]{.mark} little or [nothing to improve]{.mark} its
[security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Thanks to its geography, friendly (and
weak) neighbors, large and dynamic economy, and secure nuclear arsenal,
**[the United States faces very few significant threats]{.underline}**.
There is no Soviet Union bent upon dominating Europe and destroying the
United States. China, despite its rapid rise, cannot (and has no reason
to) challenge the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the United
States. Arms sales --- to allies or others --- are unnecessary to deter
major, direct threats to U.S. national security in the current era.47
**[[No]{.mark}r are [arms sales necessary to protect]{.mark} the United
States [from]{.mark} "falling dominoes," or the consequences of
[conflicts elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [enjoys]{.mark} what Eric Nordlinger called ["strategic
immunity."]{.mark}]{.underline}**48 Simply put, **[most of [what
happens]{.mark} in the rest of the world [is irrelevant to]{.mark} U.S.
[national security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The United States has spent
decades helping South Korea keep North Korea in check, for example, but
division of territory on the Korean peninsula does not affect America's
security. Likewise, civil wars in the Middle East and Russia's
annexation of Crimea might be significant for many reasons, but those
events do not threaten the ability of the United States to defend
itself. As a result, a **[[decision to sell weapons to Ukraine, Taiwan,
or South Korea]{.mark} [could significantly affect those
nations']{.mark} security; doing so is [not an act of ensuring]{.mark}
U.S. [national security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nor does the threat of
transnational terrorism justify most arms sales. Most fundamentally, the
actual threat from Islamist-inspired terrorism to Americans is
extraordinarily low. **[Since 9/11, neither al Qaeda nor the Islamic
State has managed an attack on the American homeland.]{.underline}**
Lone wolf terrorists inspired by those groups have done so, but since
9/11 those attacks have killed fewer than 100 Americans, an average of
about 6 people per year. **[There is simply [very little risk reduction
to be gained]{.mark} from any strategy.]{.underline}** The idea that the
United States should be willing to accept the significant negative
effects of arms sales for minimal counterterrorism gains is seriously
misguided.49

**[If there's one thing at which the [Trump]{.mark} administration
excels, it's finding arcane provisions in federal law to implement its
policy vision.]{.underline}** Secretary of State Mike **[Pompeo
announced]{.underline}** last month that **[the U.S. [would use
emergency powers to bypass Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[on]{.mark} 22 [arms deals]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the Saudi
government and other neighboring Arab states. "We presented some of
these sales almost 18 months ago to Congress, but it has failed to act,"
he wrote on Twitter. "The U.S. is, and must remain, a reliable security
partner in the Gulf and to our allies around the world. It's fundamental
to our national security."

**[A]{.underline}** **[bipartisan]{.underline}** **[group of
senators]{.underline}**, led by Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy and
Indiana Republican Todd Young, **[said]{.underline}** on Sunday that
**[they would introduce congressional resolutions to block a slate of
U.S. arms sales]{.underline}** to Saudi Arabia. The move reflects a
growing unease on Capitol Hill with the Trump administration's close
relationship with Riyadh, as well as concerns about U.S. involvement in
the kingdom's destructive war in Yemen. **[Like]{.underline}** **[so
many other disputes]{.underline}** **[in the Trump era, [the
clash]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[underscores the imbalance of
power]{.mark} in Washington]{.underline}**---**[one that long predates

A **[[reckoning with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the

**[if]{.underline}** ~~his~~ **[\[the\] administration
determines]{.underline}** that **["an emergency exists]{.underline}**
which requires the proposed sale in the national security interest of
the United States." [**[What's striking is how]{.underline}**
**[perfunctory]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [restrictions are]{.mark}
in the first place: If Congress wants [to block a]{.mark} particular
arms [sale, lawmakers]{.mark}]{.underline}** would
**[[need]{.underline}]{.mark}** to pass **[a resolution of disapproval
by a]{.underline}** **[[two-thirds]{.mark} majority]{.underline}**
[**[in]{.underline}** **[both chambers]{.underline}** **[to overcome
the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[president's likely
[veto.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Traditional]{.mark} Washington [comity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[largely [obscured this weakness]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[since the
White House would typically]{.underline}** limit or **[scrap an arms
deal if faced with enough congressional criticism. [In the hands of a
president with]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[an iron grip on one
party]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[nothing but
[contempt for the other]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[it's]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[more of [a blank check]{.mark} than a
meaningful one. The raft of]{.underline}**
**[[moribund]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[Cold War--era [laws that
give]{.mark} the president [emergency powers]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
certain circumstances, **[coupled [with Trump's]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[extraordinarily [broad definition]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}**[of when they can be invoked, [and the]{.mark} Supreme
[Court's]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[supine [deference]{.mark} to
those interpretations, [has been]{.mark} a [disastrous]{.mark} recipe
for American governance]{.underline}**.

**[Part of [the problem stems from]{.mark}]{.underline}** INS v.
**[[Chadha]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a Supreme Court decision handed down
decades ago. It's an unusual case. After Jagdish Rai Chadha's student
visa expired in 1972, U.S. immigration officials let the Kenyan-born
South Asian man stay in the country because of dangerous racial tensions
in Kenya. In 1975, however, the House of Representatives overrode that
determination, effectively ordering Chadha and five other foreign
nationals to be deported. He filed a lawsuit to challenge a provision of
U.S. immigration law that granted each chamber of Congress that power.

In a landmark 7--2 ruling in 1983, **[the Supreme Court]{.underline}**
sided with Chadha and **[effectively struck down the legislative
veto]{.underline}**. Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for the
majority, said that the provision in question was "essentially
legislative in purpose and effect." As a result, it violated the
Constitution's bicameralism requirement by allowing one chamber of
Congress to undertake a legislative act on its own. More importantly,
**[the court ruled that such vetoes violate the Constitution's
requirement that all legislation be presented to the
president]{.underline}** for his signature or veto.

Justice Byron **[[White]{.mark} took the rare step of [read]{.mark}ing
[his dissent]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the bench,
**[[signaling]{.underline}]{.mark}** his **[[deep
disapproval]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[of the court's decision. ["Today's
decision strikes down]{.mark}]{.underline}** in one fell swoop
**[[provisions in more laws]{.mark} enacted by Congress]{.underline}**
**[[than the court]{.mark} has [cumulatively]{.mark} invalidated [in its
history]{.mark}," he wrote. [He argued]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[his colleagues]{.underline}]{.mark}** had **[[insisted on a
separation of powers]{.mark} far stricter than what the
Framers]{.underline}** had **[envisioned, one]{.underline}**
**[[ill-suited]{.mark} for the modern era of the administrative
state.]{.underline}** **["To be sure, the President may have preferred
unrestricted power," White wrote, "but]{.underline}** **[that could be
precisely why Congress thought it essential to retain a check on the
exercise of delegated authority."]{.underline}**

What would happen **[next? White wrote that without the legislative
veto, [lawmakers faced a "Hobson's choice."]{.mark} Congress could
[write narrow laws]{.mark} that delegated little authority,
["leaving]{.mark} itself with [a]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[hopeless
task]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of writing laws with the requisite
specificity [to cover endless]{.mark} special [circumstances]{.mark}
across the entire policy landscape."]{.underline}** **[[Or]{.mark} it
could "[abdicate]{.mark} its [lawmaking]{.mark} function [to the
Executive]{.mark} Branch and independent agencies"]{.underline}** **[by
writing broad laws for civil servants to flesh out later. "To choose
[the former leaves]{.mark} major national [problems
unresolved]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[to opt for [the latter risks
unaccountable policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}** by those not elected
to fill that role," **[White wrote]{.underline}**.

**[[Lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[quickly
[realized]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[how the]{.mark} court's [decision
would]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[reshape]{.mark} their [relations with
the White House]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Among them was Delaware Senator
Joe **[Biden]{.underline}**, then a junior member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and now a presidential candidate. He **[pointed to
two areas where the justices had upended years of
compromise]{.underline}** between the two branches: U.S. **[military
involvement under the]{.underline}** **[W]{.underline}**ar
**[P]{.underline}**owers **[R]{.underline}**esolution,
**[and]{.underline}** **[arms sales to foreign
governments]{.underline}**. **[["The]{.mark} Supreme Court's
[decision]{.mark}]{.underline}** has **[[shattered a careful]{.mark} and
workable [accommodation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[between Congress and
the Executive, a development [that]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in my
opinion, **[[threatens]{.mark} our ability to fashion a [foreign
policy]{.mark} that is consistent, coherent, and safe," he
wrote]{.underline}** in a 1984 Syracuse Law Review article.

[**[For arms sales]{.underline}**, **[Biden's
solution]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[was to]{.underline}** **[invert the
legal mechanism]{.underline}** in question. **[Rather than giving
Congress an opportunity to stop each sale]{.underline}** before it took
effect, **[his bill would have [required]{.mark} the White House to seek
[affirmative support from lawmakers first]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**["Under a joint resolution of approval, of course, a sale cannot go
through until it is approved by both houses and signed]{.underline}** by
the President," he wrote. [**["That can]{.underline}**
**[take]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[up]{.underline}** a lot of Senate and
House **[[time, but]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[it [is
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[only way]{.underline}** **[for Congress
to retain the]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[same degree of [control]{.mark}
we had over arms sales [before Chadha."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** maneuver [**[would]{.underline}**
**[remove the math]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ematical
[disad]{.mark}vantage]{.underline}** **[faced by lawmakers: the
president's veto power. ["Under]{.mark} a joint resolution of
[disapproval]{.mark}, Congress can get its way only]{.underline}** **[if
it has enough votes to override a presidential veto," Biden
explained]{.underline}**. "So **[instead of needing fifty-one
senators']{.underline}** votes **[to defeat an arms sale we would
need]{.underline}** **[sixty-seven]{.underline}**,
**[plus]{.underline}** **[two-thirds of the House]{.underline}** of
Representatives." **[In other words, [so long as the president can
muster]{.mark} the support of]{.underline}** **[[one-third of one
chamber]{.mark} of Congress]{.underline}**, **[[lawmakers are]{.mark}
generally [powerless to halt]{.mark} controversial [arms sales]{.mark}
to foreign powers.]{.underline}**

**[Democratic lawmakers could]{.underline}** theoretically **[introduce
a bill like the one proposed by Biden]{.underline}** more than 30 years
ago. **[But]{.underline}** **[like the resolutions of disapproval
themselves, any measure that would constrain the president's power over
arms sales will almost certainly be vetoed by Trump]{.underline}**
himself. Only a new president can reverse this tide. **[[Every]{.mark}
Democratic presidential [candidate will face questions]{.mark} over
[whether they should use]{.mark} the [executive powers]{.mark} carved
out by Trump and his predecessors, [or repudiate
them]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Many candidates seem inclined to do the
former. But]{.underline}** **[[when it comes to selling]{.mark}
high-tech [weaponry]{.mark} to dubious foreign governments,
[without]{.mark} meaningful [legislative checks, the answer]{.mark} to
that question [should be easy.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

{11} [**The structure of [shared powers]{.mark}** in foreign relations
serves to **[deter abuse]{.mark} of power, [misguided policies,
irrational action, and unaccountable
behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[\[31\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#31)
**[As a fundamental matter, emphasis on [joint policymaking]{.mark}
permits the airing of sundry political, social, and economic values and
concerns. Such a structure wisely [ensures]{.mark} that the ultimate
[policies will not]{.mark} merely [reflect]{.mark} the [private
preferences or]{.mark} the [short-term political interests]{.mark} of
the
President]{.underline}**.[\[32\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#32)
{12} **[Of course, this arrangement has come under fire in the postwar
period]{.underline}** on a number of policy grounds. Some have argued,
for example, that fundamental political and technological changes in the
character of international relations and the position of the United
States in the world have rendered obsolete an eighteenth century
document designed for a peripheral, small state in the European system
of diplomatic relations. Moreover, **[it has been asserted that quick
action and a single, authoritative voice are necessary to deal with an
increasingly complex, interdependent, and technologically linked world
capable of almost instantaneous massive destruction. Extollers of
presidential dominance also have contended that only the President has
the qualitative information, the expertise, and the capacity to act with
the necessary dispatch to conduct U.S. foreign]{.underline}**
policy.[\[33\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#33) {13}
**[These policy arguments have been reviewed, and discredited,
elsewhere; space limitations here permit only a brief
commentary]{.underline}**.[\[34\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#34NAME=)
Above all else, [the implications of U.S. power]{.underline} and action
[in the twentieth century have brought about an even greater need for
**institutional accountability** and **collective judgment than existed
two hundred years ago. The** [devastating]{.mark}, incomprehensible
destruction of [**nuclear war** and]{.mark} the]{.underline} possible
[[**extermination of the human race** demonstrate]{.mark} the [need for
**joint participation**]{.mark} **in any decision to initiate
war**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[most]{.mark} of the [disputes]{.mark} at
stake between the executive and legislative branches in foreign affairs
[have **virtually nothing** to do with]{.mark} the need for [rapid
response]{.mark} to crisis.]{.underline} Rather, **[they are concerned
only with routine policy formulation and execution]{.underline}**, a
classic example of the authority exercised under the separation of
powers doctrine.[\[35\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#35)
{14} Nevertheless, these **[joint functions have been fused by the
[executive]{.mark} branch and [have become]{.mark} increasingly
[unilateral, secretive, insulated]{.mark} from public debate,
[and]{.mark} hence
[unaccountable]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[\[36\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#36)
**[[In the wake of Vietnam, Watergate, and]{.mark} the
[Iran-contra]{.mark} scandal, unilateral executive behavior has become
ever more difficult to defend. Scholarly appraisals have destroyed
arguments about intrinsic executive expertise and wisdom in foreign
affairs and the alleged superiority of information available to the
President]{.underline}**.[\[37\]](http://www.urich.edu/%7Eperspec/adler.htm#37)
Moreover, **[the inattentiveness of presidents to important details and
the [effects of \"groupthink\"]{.mark} that have dramatized and
[exacerbated the]{.mark} relative [inexperience of]{.mark} various
[presidents]{.mark} in international relations have also devalued the
extollers\' arguments]{.underline}**. Finally, foreign policies, like
domestic policies, are reflections of values. Against the strength of
democratic principles, recent occupants of the White House have failed
to demonstrate the superiority of their values in comparison to those of
the American people and their representatives in Congress. {15} [The
assumption of foreign affairs powers by recent presidents represents a
fundamental alteration of the Constitution that is both imprudent and
**dangerous**]{.underline}. We turn now to an examination of the
judiciary\'s contribution to executive hegemony in foreign affairs.

[fierce enmity]{.mark} between Republicans and Democrats, [which]{.mark}
has [spilled over]{.mark} from the White House in[to]{.mark} the
contentious, partisan and often-[gridlocked

exploit and [exacerbate]{.mark} internal
[divisions]{.mark}]{.underline}** that already existed. And
**[this]{.underline}** sort of thing **[can rapidly become
self-reinforcing]{.underline}**, as **[opposing sides leap to
accuse]{.underline}** each other not just **[of]{.underline}** bad
judgment but of **[being actively disloyal]{.underline}**. This sort of
thing is **[not unprecedented]{.underline}** in U.S. political history:
In the early days of the republic, **[Hamiltonians
accused]{.underline}** Thomas **[Jefferson of being]{.underline}**
overly **[sympathetic to]{.underline}** revolutionary
**[France,]{.underline}** while **[Jeffersonians believed Hamilton to be
a]{.underline}** closet **[monarchist with a]{.underline}** poorly
disguised **[sympathy for]{.underline}** **[Great
Britain]{.underline}**. **[It did not take much for either group to see
the other as more than misguided]{.underline}**.

Schultz also points out **[that [polarization threatens a nation's
ability to reach agreements with]{.mark} other
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is no accident that
**[[presidents]{.mark} have come to [rely more]{.mark} and
more]{.underline}** **[[on executive agreements]{.mark} rather than
formal, ratified [treaties]{.mark}: It [has become increasingly
difficult to get]{.mark} the latter [through a divided
Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Of equal concern is the possibility
**[that [other states]{.mark} [will be wary of making]{.mark} mutually
beneficial [agreements]{.mark} with the United States]{.underline}**,
simply because **[[they have no way to be sure]{.mark} whether [an
agreement]{.mark} reached this year [will survive]{.mark} the next
election]{.underline}**. People who think U.S. interests are best served
by avoiding international agreements and maximizing the country's
freedom of action (e.g., John Bolton) might welcome such a situation,
but this view is dangerously shortsighted. The **[[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has benefited greatly]{.mark} [from]{.mark} a host of
[past agreements]{.mark} of various types,]{.underline}** and **[[it
makes no sense to encourage other states to have
less]{.underline}]{.mark}** and less **[[confidence in]{.mark} the value
of [U.S. pledges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Nobody expects the United
States to act contrary to its interests, but **[how can it expect other
countries to do something it wants in exchange for something they want,
if they have no way of knowing whether it will deliver?]{.underline}**

Indeed, **[the problem of inconstancy may be even worse than Schultz
suggests.]{.underline}** **[[Once]{.mark} foreign [policy begins to
oscillate]{.mark} between two]{.underline}** increasingly **[divided
factions, [each]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the **[[groups has an
incentive to pursue its most]{.mark} ambitious, controversial, or
[extreme projects]{.mark} whenever it happens to be in a position of
power.]{.underline}** Not only does **[the pendulum oscillate with
greater frequency, the swings themselves become more
extreme.]{.underline}**

**[[Another cost]{.mark} of polarization [is]{.mark} the [erosion of
America's]{.mark} broader [image]{.mark} for competence and good
sense]{.underline}**. The **[[more]{.mark} bitter, divided,
[gridlocked]{.mark}, venal, and downright stupid]{.underline}** American
**[politics [become]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the **[[less
appealing]{.mark} the American system of government is]{.underline}** to
outside observers. When that happens, **[[the country's moral
voice]{.underline}]{.mark}**---already compromised by foreign-policy
excesses---**[[gets reduced to a whisper]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I mean,
seriously: **[[What sensible]{.mark} foreign [country would
listen]{.mark} to an American telling it how to organize a
government]{.underline}**, write a constitution, root out political
corruption, or hold officials accountable, **[[when the U.S]{.mark}.
system itself [seems increasingly broken]{.mark} and the political
ecosystem is populated by unprincipled]{.underline}** popinjays,
**[corrupt con men, habitual liars, and senior officials]{.underline}**
whose chief skill is failing upward? **[When]{.underline}** a nation's
politics are sufficiently **[polarized]{.underline}**, **[the
worst]{.underline}** people can **[still find]{.underline}** safe
**[sinecures]{.underline}** within their tribe. Yeats got it exactly
right: "**[The best lack all conviction, / While the worst are full of
passionate intensity]{.underline}**."

**[[Polarization]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[threatens to defeat the
growing effort by Congress to wrest back]{.underline}]{.mark}** some of
the **[[powers over foreign policy]{.mark} enshrined in the
Constitution]{.underline}** (**[such as the capacity to declare
war]{.underline}**), **[powers that presidents have]{.underline}**
gradually **[usurped]{.underline}** over many decades. On balance,
**[U.S. [foreign policy would be better served if Congress provided a
forum for]{.mark} genuine [debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[in part to
better inform the public]{.underline}**---and **[[if it
performed]{.mark} effective [oversight]{.mark} over many aspects of the
country's foreign policy]{.underline}**. But **[[a Congress divided into
warring factions]{.mark}, that uses its powers not to debate, oversee,
and refine U.S. policy, but rather to grandstand, distract, and advance
a purely partisan agenda, [is hardly an institution]{.mark} that is
[likely to have a positive impact]{.mark} [on]{.mark} U.S. foreign
[policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Hegemonic collapses causes every global hotpot to go [nuclear]{.underline}

**Brands 15 --** Hal Brands, PhD in International Relations, Faculty at
the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University and the Elliott
School of International Affairs at George Washington University, "Fools
Rush Out? The Flawed Logic of Offshore Balancing", Washington Quarterly,
p. 7-28

The fundamental reason is that [both U.S. influence and international
stability are thoroughly interwoven with a robust U.S. forward
presence.]{.underline} Regarding influence, [the protection that
Washington has afforded its allies has equally afforded the United
States great sway over those allies' policies]{.underline}.43 [During
the Cold War and after]{.underline}, for instance, [the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has used the influence
provided by its security posture to veto allies' pursuit of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, [to obtain more advantageous terms in financial
and trade agreements]{.underline}, and even to affect the composition of
allied nations' governments.44 More broadly, it has used its alliances
as vehicles for shaping political, security, and economic agendas in key
regions and bilateral relationships, thus giving the United States an
outsized voice on a range of important issues. To be clear, this
influence has never been as pervasive as U.S. officials might like, or
as some observers might imagine. But by any reasonable standard of
comparison, it has nonetheless been remarkable. [One can tell a similar
story about the relative stability of the post-war order]{.underline}.
As even some leading offshore balancers have acknowledged[, the lack of
conflict in regions like Europe in recent decades is not something that
has occurred naturally]{.underline}. [It has occurred because the
["American pacifier"]{.mark} has suppressed precisely the dynamics that
previously fostered geopolitical turmoil. That pacifier has [limited
**arms races** and]{.mark} security **[competitions]{.mark}** by
providing the protection that allows other countries to under-build
their militaries. It has soothed historical rivalries by affording a
climate of security in which powerful countries like Germany and Japan
could be revived economically and reintegrated into thriving and fairly
cooperative regional orders.]{.underline} [It has induced caution in the
behavior of allies and adversaries alike, **[deterring
aggression]{.mark}** and dissuading other destabilizing
behavior]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer has noted, the United States
"effectively acts as a night watchman," lending order to an otherwise
disorderly and anarchical environment.45 [What would happen [if
Washington backed away]{.mark} from this role]{.underline}? The most
logical answer is that [both U.S. influence and [**global stability**
would suffer]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With respect to
influence,]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would]{.underline} effectively [be surrendering
the most powerful bargaining chip it has traditionally wielded in
dealing with friends and allies,]{.underline} [and jeopardizing the
position of leadership it has used to shape bilateral and regional
agendas for decades. The consequences would seem no less damaging where
stability is concerned]{.underline}. As offshore balancers have argued,
it may be that U.S. retrenchment would force local powers to spend more
on defense, while perhaps assuaging certain points of friction with
countries that feel threatened or encircled by U.S. presence. But it
equally stands to reason that [removing the American pacifier would
liberate the more destabilizing influences that U.S. policy had
previously stifled. Long-dormant [security competitions might
reawaken]{.mark} as countries armed themselves more
vigorously]{.underline}; [historical antagonisms]{.underline} [between
old rivals might reemerge in the absence of a robust U.S. presence and
the reassurance it provides]{.underline}. Moreover, [countries that seek
to revise existing regional orders in their favor]{.underline}---think
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** in **[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
or **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Asia---might indeed applaud U.S.
retrenchment, but [they [might]{.mark} just as plausibly feel empowered
to more [assertively press]{.mark} their interests]{.underline}. If the
United States has been a kind of Leviathan in key regions, Mearsheimer
acknowledges, then "[take away that Leviathan and there is likely to be
big trouble]{.underline}."46 Scanning the global horizon today, [one can
easily see where such trouble might arise. In Europe,]{.underline} [a
revisionist Russia is already destabilizing its neighbors and contesting
the post-Cold War settlement in the region.]{.underline} [In the Gulf
and broader Middle East, the threat of [Iran]{.mark}ian ascendancy has
[stoked]{.mark} region-wide tensions manifesting in [proxy wars]{.mark}
and hints of an incipient arms race, even as that region also contends
with a severe threat to its stability in the form of the Islamic State.
In East Asia, a rising China is challenging the regional status quo in
numerous ways, sounding alarms among its neighbors---many of whom also
have historical grievances against each other.]{.underline} In these
circumstances, [removing the American pacifier would likely yield not
low-cost stability, but increased conflict and upheaval. That conflict
and upheaval]{.underline}, in turn, [would be quite damaging to U.S.
interests]{.underline} even if it did not result in the nightmare
scenario of a hostile power dominating a key region. [[It is hard to
imagine]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [that [increased
instability]{.mark} and acrimony [would produce]{.mark} the
[robust]{.mark} multilateral [cooperation]{.mark} necessary [to deal
with]{.mark} transnational threats from **[pandemics]{.mark}** to
piracy. More [problematic]{.mark} still [might be]{.mark} the
**[economic consequences]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As scholars like
Michael Mandelbaum have argued, [the [enormous]{.mark} progress toward
global [prosperity]{.mark} and integration that has occurred since World
War II]{.underline} (and now the Cold War) [[has come in the climate
of]{.mark} relative stability and [security provided]{.mark} largely by
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.47 [[One]{.mark} simply
[cannot]{.mark} confidently [predict]{.mark} that [this]{.mark} progress
[would endure]{.mark} amid escalating geopolitical competition in
regions of enormous importance to the world economy]{.underline}.
Perhaps [the greatest risk that a strategy of offshore balancing would
run]{.underline}, of course, [is that a key region might not be able to
maintain its own balance following U.S. retrenchment]{.underline}. That
prospect might have seemed far-fetched in the early post-Cold War era,
and it remains unlikely in the immediate future. But [in East Asia
particularly, the rise and growing assertiveness of China has
highlighted the medium- to long-term danger that a hostile power could
in fact gain regional primacy. If China's economy continues to grow
rapidly]{.underline}, and if Beijing continues to increase military
spending by 10 percent or more each year, [then its neighbors will
ultimately face grave challenges in containing Chinese power even if
they join forces in that endeavor]{.underline}. This possibility,
ironically, is one to which leading advocates of retrenchment have been
attuned. "The United States will have to play a key role in countering
China," Mearshimer writes, "because its Asian neighbors are not strong
enough to do it by themselves."48 If this is true, however, then
[offshore balancing becomes a dangerous and potentially self-defeating
strategy]{.underline}. As mentioned above, [[it could lead]{.mark}
countries like [Japan and]{.mark} South [Korea to seek **nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [stoking arms races and
elevating regional tensions]{.underline}. Alternatively, and perhaps
more worryingly, [it might encourage the scenario that offshore
balancers seek to avoid, by easing China's ascent to regional
hegemony.]{.underline} As Robert Gilpin has written, "[Retrenchment by
its very nature is an indication of relative weakness and declining
power, and thus retrenchment can have a deteriorating effect on
relations with allies and rivals]{.underline}."49 [In East Asia today,
U.S. allies rely on U.S. reassurance to navigate increasingly fraught
relationships with a more assertive China precisely because they
understand that they will have great trouble balancing Beijing on their
own]{.underline}. A significant U.S. retrenchment might therefore tempt
these countries to acquiesce to, or bandwagon with, a rising China if
they felt that prospects for successful resistance were diminishing as
the United States retreated.50 In the same vein, retrenchment would
compromise alliance relationships, basing agreements, and other assets
that might help Washington check Chinese power in the first place---and
that would allow the United States to surge additional forces into
theater in a crisis. In sum, if one expects that Asian countries will be
unable to counter China themselves, then reducing U.S. influence and
leverage in the region is a curious policy. Offshore balancing might
promise to preserve a stable and advantageous environment while reducing
U.S. burdens. But upon closer analysis, the probable outcomes of the
strategy seem more perilous and destabilizing than its proponents
acknowledge.

#### Congressional acquiescence over [arms sales]{.underline} undermines its power [more broadly]{.underline} -- requiring [affirmative approval]{.underline} lets Congress [reclaim its relevance]{.underline}

**[What Should Congress Do?]{.underline}**

[**[Congress is not without options in responding to this]{.underline}**
**[assault on its powers]{.underline}**]{.mark}, however. Republican and
Democratic senators are joining together to disapprove all 22
"emergency" sales proposed by the president. Even if there is
insufficient time to pass resolutions of disapproval for these
particular sales before the agreements are signed, Congress could pass a
law to prohibit the delivery of these weapons systems. It could also
override the president's veto of its resolution to end U.S. military
participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which would require the
support of Republican senators. It could impose a ban or strict
conditions on all future weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. And
**[it could rewrite the procedures for consideration and review of arms
sales. Instead of allowing weapons to be transferred unless two-thirds
of both houses vote to override the inevitable presidential veto of
attempted blocking legislation, [Congress could]{.mark} [treat]{.mark}
major [arms sales with at least the seriousness it treats trade
agreements, which require affirmative]{.mark} congressional
[approval]{.mark} to move forward]{.underline}**. In short,
[**[Congress]{.underline}** **[must fight to reclaim its relevance as an
active participant in foreign policy]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and
national security]{.underline}** decisions.

Returning from its Memorial Day recess, **[Congress has no lack of
foreign policy emergencies to respond to]{.underline}** -- walking the

**[But]{.underline}** **[[if it can't]{.mark} stand up to [protect
its]{.mark} own [prerogatives on arms sales]{.mark}, then [its chances
of being heard on anything else will be permanently
diminished.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[[We face many dangers]{.underline}]{.mark}, however. [The diversity
of]{.underline} the security and economic [threats around the globe is
daunting. [Terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has already struck the
united states brutally, [will be a continuing threat]{.underline} in the
years ahead, and it may become [more deadly if
**[w]{.mark}**]{.underline}eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction [proliferate and reach the wrong
hands]{.underline}. the greatest security threat might be the danger
that [nuclear weapons]{.underline} or materials in russia [could be
stolen and sold to terrorists]{.underline} or hostile nations and used
against americans at home or abroad. groups and individuals that do not
wish us well will also attempt to attack us with weapons of mass
disruption, such as information warfare, which could assault our
economic, financial, communications, information, transportation, or
energy infrastructures. there are numerous other threats to national
security. [The world\'s [population will]{.mark} increase
substantially]{.underline} during the first half of the twenty-first
century, [placing]{.underline} added [[strain]{.mark} on]{.underline}
natural [[resources]{.mark}, including water, and]{.underline} possibly
[[intensifying **interstate conflicts**]{.mark} and **civil
strife**]{.underline}. Economic crises will likely be a regular
occurrence, throwing some nations into turmoil and occasionally creating
widespread financial instability. [**International [crime]{.mark}**, the
**illegal [drug trade]{.mark}**]{.underline}, global warming,
[**infectious [diseases]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} other **[transnational
problems]{.mark}** will]{.underline} challenge national sovereignty and
[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[security]{.underline}]{.mark},
prosperity, and health. yet these dangerous threats are balanced by many
opportunities. as the world\'s most powerful nation, [the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has]{.mark} a [**tremendous capacity** to influence the world]{.mark}
for good---to protect international peace, root out terrorism, resolve
conflicts, spread prosperity, and advance democracy and freedom. [Other
nations **look to us for leadership** and to **set an example**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} responsible and [**[principled]{.mark}**
international [action]{.mark}]{.underline}. our [values of]{.underline}
freedom, justice, the [rule of law,]{.underline} and equality of
opportunity are increasingly the values of peoples around the globe. in
the coming decades, the spread of these values and incredible advances
in science and technology [will give us]{.underline} the [capacity to
disseminate knowledge, cure diseases, reduce poverty, protect the
environment, and create jobs]{.underline} in the farthest-flung corners
of the world. so our new world is as full of hope as it is of danger.
[To meet the threats]{.underline} and take advantage of the
opportunities, [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[will need strong leadership]{.underline}, expertise in many fields, and
large measures of foresight and resolve. again and again, i have been
impressed with the need for u.s. leadership on the most pressing
international challenges. if something important has to be done---from
fighting international terrorism to bringing peace to the middle
east---[no other country can take our place]{.underline}. we may not get
it right every time, but our leadership is usually constructive and
helpful. we must, however, be aware of the limits to american power. the
united states is neither powerful enough to cause all of the world\'s
ills, nor powerful enough to cure them. so it is critical that we
maintain good relations with our international allies and friends,
manage prudently our sometimes difficult relationships with russia and
china, and support and strengthen international institutions. a world
that is committed to working together through effective international
institutions and partnerships will be the world most capable of
protecting peace and security and advancing prosperity and freedom.
[Equally [important for]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[successful foreign
policy will be cooperation between the president and
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}. today\'s moment of u.s. preeminence has
not come to this nation by chance. sound policies shaped by past
presidents and congresses helped to place us in this desirable position.
to remain secure, prosperous, and free, the united states must continue
to lead. that leadership requires the president and Congress to live up
to their constitutional responsibilities to work together to craft a
strong foreign policy. the great constitutional scholar edward corwin
noted that the constitution is an invitation for the president and
congress to struggle for the privilege of directing foreign policy.
although the president is the principal foreign policy actor, the
Constitution delegates more specific foreign policy powers to congress
than to the executive. it designates the president as commander-in-chief
and head of the executive branch, whereas it gives Congress the power to
declare war and the power of the purse. the president can negotiate
treaties and nominate foreign policy officials, but the senate must
approve them. congress is also granted the power to raise and support
armies, establish rules on naturalization, regulate foreign commerce,
and define and punish offenses on the high seas. This shared
constitutional responsibility presupposes that the president and
Congress will work together to develop foreign policy, and it leaves the
door open to both of them to assert their authority. on some basic
foreign policy issues, the president and congress agree on their
respective roles. for instance, congress generally does not question the
president\'s power to manage diplomatic relations with other nations,
and presidents accept that congress must appropriate funds for diplomacy
and defense. but on a panoply of other issues---from oversight of
foreign aid and responsibility for trade policy to authorization of
military deployments and funding for international
institutions---Congress and the president battle intensely to exert
influence and advance their priorities. Of course, I approach the
executive--legislative relationship from the perspective i gained during
my congressional experience. That experience has convinced me that
[[Congress]{.mark} plays a **very important role** in foreign policy,
but does not always live up to its **constitutional responsibilities**.
Its [tendency]{.mark} too often [has been]{.mark}]{.underline} either
[[to **defer** to the president]{.underline}]{.mark} or to engage in
foreign policy haphazardly. I recognize that political pressures,
institutional dynamics, and the heavy domestic demands placed on
congress can make it difficult for it to exercise its foreign policy
responsibilities effectively. But I believe that [[Congress could
**improve its foreign policy performance markedly** if it made a
concerted effort]{.mark} to do so. Although the president is the chief
foreign policy maker, [Congress has]{.mark} a [responsibility to
be]{.mark} both an informed **critic** and [a **constructive
partner**]{.mark} of the president]{.underline}. the ideal established
by the founders is neither for one branch to dominate the other nor for
there to be an identity of views between them. Rather, [the
founders]{.underline} wisely [sought to encourage a [creative
tension]{.mark} between the president and Congress that [would **produce
policies that advance national interests**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
reflect the views of the American People. Sustained consultation between
the president and congress is the most important mechanism for fostering
an effective foreign policy with broad support at home and respect and
punch overseas. in a world of both danger and opportunity, we need such
a foreign policy to advance our interests and values around the globe.

**[[Arguing]{.mark} that [his proposed border wall]{.mark} with Mexico
[is needed]{.mark}]{.underline}** to respond to a public health and
humanitarian crisis, **[President Donald [Trump declared a national
state of emergency]{.mark}]{.underline}** to secure the authority and
resources to build it. The problem is that it may actually make
Americans less healthy and safe in other ways.

As public health law experts, we assess how **[emergency declarations

wildfires, during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases like Ebola
and for other public health crises.]{.underline}**

**[[The president's]{.mark} unprecedented [use of the executive branch's
broad powers]{.mark} to declare emergencies [could lead to a backlash
that would constrain]{.mark} him and [future presidents]{.mark} needing
to use emergency powers later]{.underline}**, while increasing public
skepticism of critical health responses.

**[President [Trump's border wall emergency is
unpopular]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Polls show that over 60% of Americans
oppose significant new wall construction. Nearly the same percentage
feel that no emergency exists at the order.

**[The [House]{.mark} has [already]{.mark} passed a joint resolution
[opposing the declaration,]{.mark} and with several Republican senators
expressing their unease with the maneuver]{.underline}**, **[[the other
chamber could follow suit]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well. **[Although
the president would surely veto any attempt to overturn his emergency
declaration, [this would mark the first time that Congress has expressly
opposed such a move]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, 16 states have filed lawsuits to overturn the emergency.
Public Citizen and the Americans Civil Liberties Union have filed
separate cases. **[Allegations include that the president acted
unconstitutionally in the face of Congressional refusal to allocate
funding.]{.underline}** The Supreme Court may have the final word and
could dramatically limit the president's authority in this area.

use]{.mark} some [\$2.5 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}** in military
construction funds **[[to build]{.mark} parts of [the
wall]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[even though Congress refused to
allocate as much]{.mark} money]{.underline}** for border barriers as
Trump wanted. **[As the majority opinion by
[judges]{.mark}]{.underline}** Clifton and Friedland **[[explains,
if]{.mark} [Section 8005 does not authorize]{.mark} Trump\'s attempted
[diversion of funds,]{.mark} then [the president would be in violation
of the Appropriations Clause]{.mark} of the Constitution, which gives
Congress exclusive control over the public purse.]{.underline}** The
**[Founders considered it essential to deny the executive the power to
control the federal budget, thus preventing any one politician from
being [repeatedly demanded]{.mark} by the president]{.underline}** over
the last two years: Defendants mistakenly focus on the assertion that
\[the Department of Defense\] \"could not have anticipated that \[the
Department of Homeland Security\] would **[able to combine the powers of
\"the sword\" and \"the purse,\" as James Madison put it.]{.underline}**
The majority\'s analysis of Section 8005 strikes me as compelling. The
**[statute allows diversion of funds]{.underline}** **[only
for]{.underline}** \"higher priority items, based on **[unforeseen
military requirements]{.underline}**, than those for which originally
appropriated...\" And \"**[[in no case]{.mark}\" [may the]{.mark} the
[executive transfer funds]{.mark} \"[where the]{.mark} item
for]{.underline}** which reprogramming is requested **[[has been denied
by the Congress]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** Far from being an
\"unforeseen\" need, **[[funding for wall]{.mark}-building
[was]{.mark}]{.underline}** request specific support for roads, fences,
and lighting.\" Even assuming that is true, the fact remains that DHS
came to DoD for funds because Congress refused to grant DHS itself those
funds. And when properly viewed as applying to the broader
\"requirement\" of a border wall, not to DHS\'s specific need to turn to
an entity other than Congress for funds, it is not credible that DoD did
not foresee this requirement. The long history of the President\'s
efforts to build a border barrier and of Congress\'s refusing to
appropriate the funds he requested makes it implausible that this need
was unforeseen... The same history also makes clear that the
**[[funding]{.mark} in question [was denied by
Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which is an additional reason why
Section 8005 does not authorize it: Even if there could be doubt about
how to interpret \"unforeseen,\" it is clear that **[Congress denied
this request]{.underline}**... Construing section 8005 with an eye
towards the ordinary and common-sense meaning of \"denied,\" real-world
events in the months and years leading up to the 2019 appropriations
bills leave no doubt that Congress considered and denied appropriations
for the border barrier construction projects that DoD now seeks to
finance using its section 8005 authority.... In sum, Congress considered
the \"item\" at issue here---a physical barrier along the entire
southern border, including in the Yuma, El Paso, Tucson, and El Centro
sectors \[at issue in this case\]---and decided in a transparent process
subject to great public scrutiny to appropriate less than the total
amount the President had sought for that item. To call that anything but
a \"denial\" is not credible. As I have pointed out
[previously](https://reason.com/2019/06/29/federal-court-rules-against-trump-in-border-wall-case/),
the stakes here go far beyond the specifics of the wall issue. **[[If
the Trump administration can use terms like \"unforeseen...
requirement\" to allocate]{.mark} funds [for the wall]{.mark}, it---and
future [administrations]{.mark}---[can use similar tactics to spend
money on all sorts of purposes that Congress never authorized]{.mark}.
[This would]{.mark} go a long way towards [concentrat]{.mark}ing [the
power of the \"purse\" and \"sword\"]{.mark} in the hands of one
person---[exactly the result the Founding Fathers hoped to
forestall]{.mark}]{.underline}** by giving Congress exclusive authority
over appropriations. Conservatives who might be happy to see Trump do
this to build the Border Wall will not be so thrilled if the next
Democratic President uses similar tactics to building projects he or she
believes are [needed for the \"Green New
Deal\"](https://www.fastcompany.com/90365788/the-green-new-deal-could-change-the-way-america-builds-heres-how)

Judy **[Woodruff:]{.underline}**

On this President\'s Day holiday, we\'re taking a look at presidential
powers and how they have changed over time.

We\'re joined now by two presidential historians Douglas Brinkley,
professor of history at Rice University and author of several books on
the presidency. And Andrew Rudalevige, he\'s professor of government at
Bowdoin College and the author of \"The New Imperial Presidency:
Renewing Presidential Power after Watergate.\"

And welcome to both of you.

Andrew Rudalevige, let me start with you.

**[[How much more powerful is the]{.mark} American [presidency
today]{.mark}]{.underline}** than it was either in the earliest days of
this country or even 150 years ago**[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Andrew **[Rudalevige:]{.underline}**

Well, **[[infinitely]{.mark} more powerful]{.underline}** **[[than at
the]{.mark} time of the Constitutional
[Convention]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

If you think of the very title president, that comes from the word
presider. There was no idea, I think, that the president would be the
main decider, as George W. Bush styled himself.

**[The real growth is in the 20th and]{.underline}** now the **[21st
century. [You have the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[great
expansiveness]{.underline}** **[of the scope and size of
government]{.underline}**. **[Most]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of that\'s
[in the executive]{.mark} branch]{.underline}**, **[and so [the
president has more means]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[many [more
staff]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[many [more
people]{.mark}]{.underline}** to help ~~him~~ \[them\] carry out ~~his~~
\[the office's\] preferences.

**[[And you]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
over time, **[the [delegation of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[great]{.mark} amounts of [power]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to the
president by Congress, [including things]{.mark}]{.underline}** that are
**[[specifically delegated to]{.mark} the [Congress]{.mark} by the
Constitution]{.underline}**, trade power, for example.

**[[In other areas, presidents have]{.underline}]{.mark}** sort of
[**[pushed hard]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[try to
[take over]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[war
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example. And **[[Congress]{.mark} on
the whole [has been]{.mark}]{.underline}** pretty
[**[supine]{.underline}** **[about that.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

**[So [it\'s a great growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[of
power]{.underline}**]{.mark} in fits and starts, but, certainly
**[compared, to the founding]{.underline}**, **[[a much more powerful
office than]{.mark} was [anticipated]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In order **[to comply with the]{.underline}** Arms Export Control Act
(**[AECA]{.underline}**), **[[the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** government
**[[must generate a risk assessment]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order
**[[to confirm]{.mark} that [sales are unlikely to produce unwanted
outcomes.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This requirement makes sense, because
history shows that arms sales can lead to a host of negative, unintended
consequences. These consequences come in many forms, from those that
affect the United States, such as blowback and entanglement in foreign
conflicts, to those that affect entire regions, such as instability and
dispersion, to those that affect the recipient regime itself, such as
enabling oppression and increasing the likelihood of military coups.
Forecasting how weapons will be used, especially over the course of
decades, is difficult, but history provides evidence of the factors that
make negative outcomes more likely. **[[Sadly]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[however, [even a cursory review of American]{.mark} arms
[sales]{.mark} over time [makes it clear that
neither]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[the White House,
nor]{.underline}**]{.mark} the **[[Pentagon, nor]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the **[[State]{.underline}]{.mark}** Department --- all of which are
involved in approving potential sales --- **[[takes]{.mark} the [risk
assessment]{.mark} process [seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[Historically, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[has sold weapons to almost any nation]{.mark} that wanted to buy
them --- [suggesting]{.mark} that the [risk assessment]{.mark} process
[is rigged]{.mark} to not find risk.]{.underline}** From 2002 to 2016,
America delivered \$197 billion in weapons to 167 states worldwide.6
Thirty-two of these countries purchased at least \$1 billion in arms.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was America's biggest client, purchasing
\$25.8 billion worth of weapons --- including F-15s and a litany of
helicopters, naval assets, and associated munitions. As shown in Table
1, the top 10 clients collectively bought \$124 billion in arms ---
accounting for roughly two-thirds of the value of America's total global
exports since 2002. **[[Given the]{.mark} amount of [chaos, instability,
and conflict in the world, it is difficult to imagine what]{.mark} sort
of [process would assess]{.mark} as many as [167 of]{.mark} the world's
roughly [200 countries as safe]{.mark} bets]{.underline}** to receive
American weapons.

**[Moreover]{.underline}**, [**[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[has a long history]{.mark} of [selling weapons]{.mark} to nations
[where]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[immediate risks were
obvious]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[From 1981 to 2010,
[the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[sold]{.mark} small arms and light
[weapons to 59 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and major conventional
weapons to]{.underline}** **[35 percent]{.underline}** [**[of
countries]{.underline}** **[actively engaged in]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[a [high-level conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[sold small arms to
66 percent]{.underline}** **[and major conventional weapons to 40
percent]{.underline}** **[of countries]{.underline}** **[actively
engaged in a low-level conflict]{.underline}**.7 As one author noted,
**[[in 1994 there]{.mark} [were 50 ongoing]{.mark} ethnic and
territorial [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the world and
[**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[had [armed]{.mark}]{.underline}**
at least one side in **[[45]{.mark} of them]{.underline}**. Since 9/11,
the United States has sold weapons to at least two dyads in conflict:
Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and Turkey and the Kurds.8

#### [Indexing]{.underline} of US sales proves current risk assessment [fails]{.underline}

for the Cato's Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department,
associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government (George
Mason University), former director of the University of

Policy," CATO, Policy Analysis 836,
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy

**[To produce a risk assessment of American arms recipients since 2002,
we consulted previous research]{.underline}** to identify the risk
factors most commonly associated with both short- and long-term negative
outcomes. Unfortunately, there are no hard data on the precise
relationship between many of these risk factors and the probability of
negative outcomes. We also lack data entirely for certain risk factors
that we would otherwise have included. A nation's previous use (and
misuse) of American weapons, for example, is clearly among the most
important factors to assess. Neither the government nor academic
research, however, exists to inform such an assessment. As a result,
[**[we take a conservative approach]{.underline}**, **[creating an index
of overall riskiness based on straightforward
assumptions]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[about the correlations between
risk factors and negative outcomes]{.underline}** on data that are
available, rather than attempting to make precise predictions about the
impact of each specific risk factor, or speculating about the impact of
factors we cannot measure.

The first risk factor **[we consider]{.underline}** is **[the stability
of the recipient nation]{.underline}**. We assume that fragile states
with tenuous legitimacy and little ability to deliver services and
police their own territory, or those that cannot manage conflict within
their borders, pose a greater risk for the dispersion and misuse of
weapons. Research also indicates that military aid can increase the
likelihood of a military coup, an outcome even more likely in the case
of a fragile state.9 To measure this factor, we take the most recent
score for each nation on the Fragile States Index, which determines a
state's vulnerability by looking at a range of economic, political, and
social factors.10

The second risk factor **[we look at]{.underline}** is the **[behavior
of the state to]{.underline}**ward **[its own citizens.]{.underline}**
We assume that states that rank poorly on human rights performance or
that regularly use violence against their own people pose a greater risk
of misusing weapons in the short or long term. To measure this we rely
on two sources: Freedom House's Freedom in the World rankings, which
assess "the condition of political rights and civil liberties around the
world,"11 and the State Department's Political Terror Scale, which
provides a more specific measurement of a state's use of torture and
violence against its citizens.12

Finally, **[we consider the level of conflict]{.underline}**, both
internal and external, **[each state is engaged in]{.underline}**. We
assume that countries dealing with widespread terrorism and insurgency,
or actively engaged in an interstate conflict, also represent higher
risks of negative outcomes such as dispersion, blowback, entanglement,
conflict, and human rights abuses. Though the United States may have
reasons to provide arms to nations engaged in such conflicts or dealing
with terrorism, the risk of negative consequences remains. To assess
these factors, we rely on the Global Terrorism Index, which measures the
scope of terrorism in a country, and the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict
Dataset, published by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program and the Peace
Research Institute Oslo, which tracks each country's involvement in wars
as well as in smaller conflicts.13

**[To gauge the riskiness of selling weapons to a given country, we
combined its scores on]{.underline}** these five **[metrics into a
single risk index score]{.underline}**. Since the measures all used
different scales, we first recoded each of them into three categories:
low, medium, and high risk. For example, we coded "not free" countries
as high risk (3 points); "partly free" countries as medium risk (2
points); and "free" countries as low risk (1 point). The result was a
risk index that runs from 5 (countries scoring "low risk" on all
measures) to 15 (countries scoring "high risk" on all measures).

To facilitate our reporting **[we]{.underline}** then
**[grouped]{.underline}** the **[results into four risk
categories]{.underline}**. We gave the Highest Risk designation to the 5
countries that scored as "high risk" on every measure. At the other end
of the spectrum, the Lowest Risk category contains the 38 countries that
rated as "low risk" on all five measures. The categories between these
two are Very Risky (64 countries) and Somewhat Risky (60 countries).
Table 2 reveals the distribution of countries across risk categories as
well as the average total arms sales by category since 2002.

Three important observations immediately emerge from the analysis.
First, **[there are a large number of risky customers in the world, and
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[sells weapons]{.underline}** **[to most of them]{.underline}**.
Thirty-five nations (21 percent) scored in the highest-risk category on
at least two metrics, and 72 (43 percent) were in the highest-risk
category on at least one of the five measures. There simply are not that
many safe bets when it comes to the arms trade.

Second, the [**[data provide]{.underline}** **[compelling
evidence]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that [the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[does not discriminate between high- and low-risk
customers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [**[average sales to the riskiest
nations]{.underline}** **[are higher than those to the least
risky]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[nations]{.underline}**. Considering
discrete components of the index, for example, the **[22 countries coded
as "highest risk" on the Global Terrorism Index bought an average of
\$1.91 billion worth of American weapons. The 28 countries in active,
high-level conflicts bought an average of \$2.94 billion worth of
arms.]{.underline}**

**[Applying our risk assessment framework to the list of 16 nations
currently banned from buying American weapons helps illustrate the
validity of our approach.]{.underline}** The average score of banned
nations is 11.6, with 12 nations scoring 10 or higher. The
highest-scoring nations were **[[Syria, Sudan]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and the Democratic Republic of the **[[Congo]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
with **[[Iran, Eritrea, and the Central African
Republic]{.underline}]{.mark}** not far behind. Clearly these **[[are
nations]{.mark} to which [the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[should not]{.mark} be [sell]{.mark}ing
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[What is [especially
troubling]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[is]{.mark} that
[the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[sold weapons to]{.mark} several of
[these countries]{.mark} in the years [right
before]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[sales were banned]{.underline}**,
**[when most]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of the [risks were readily
apparent.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[Moreover, America's customer list
includes 32 countries]{.underline}** **[with a risk score]{.underline}**
**[above the average of those on the banned list]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
**[This reinforces our concern that [the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
government **[[does not block sales to countries that clearly pose a
risk]{.mark} of negative consequences.]{.underline}**

The third major observation is that this lack of discrimination is
dangerous. As simple as it is, our risk assessment is a useful guide to
forecasting negative consequences. **[The five [countries that scored as
high risk on all]{.mark}]{.underline}** five **[[measures]{.mark}
provide a clear illustration of the risks of arms sales. This group,
which [purchased an average of \$1.8 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[in U.S. weapons since 9/11]{.mark}, includes Libya, Iraq, Yemen,
the]{.underline}** Democratic Republic of the **[Congo, and Sudan.
These]{.underline}** five **[countries]{.underline}**, recall, **[are
classified]{.underline}** by the various metrics **[as]{.underline}**:
**["terror everywhere,"]{.underline}** **["not free,"]{.underline}**
**["most fragile,"]{.underline}** **["large impact from
terrorism,"]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** as being **[involved
in]{.underline}** **[high-level conflicts]{.underline}**. These
governments have used their American weapons to promote oppression,
commit human rights abuses, and perpetuate bloody civil wars.

**[Within the Very Risky category, each country rated as "highest risk"
on at least one measure]{.underline}**, and 30 scored as "highest risk"
on at least two measures. This group also represents the full range of
unintended consequences from arms sales. **[Afghanistan, Egypt, Somalia,
and Ukraine fall into this category. This group collectively spent an
average of \$1.38 billion]{.underline}** **[over the time
period]{.underline}**. Since 9/11, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (which
scored a 12) invaded Yemen, intervened in Tunisia and Syria, and
provoked a crisis with Qatar, while cementing a track record of human
rights abuses and government oppression. Other states in this category,
such as Afghanistan (score of 14), have entangled the United States in
counterproductive conflicts since 9/11 and continue to do so today.

Even arms sales to the less risky nations do not come without risk. For
example, the Somewhat Risky category includes the United Arab Emirates,
which is involved in an active conflict in Yemen, as well as Georgia,
which has dangerous neighbors. Finally, the Lowest Risk category
includes most of the NATO nations, Taiwan, South Korea, and a range of
other, mostly smaller nations with stable governments, such as Barbados
and Grenada, located in friendly neighborhoods. These countries pose
little risk for problems like dispersion, destabilization, or misuse of
weapons for oppression. In some cases, however, arms sales could alter
regional balances of power in ways that increase tensions and the chance
of conflict. U.S. arms sales to NATO allies, as part of the European
Reassurance Initiative, for example, have upset Russian leaders.14
Similarly, arms sales to Taiwan, itself not a risky customer, have
nonetheless raised tensions between China and the United States.15

**[In short, even a relatively simple risk assessment
makes]{.underline}** it **[clear]{.underline}** that **[[the policy of
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[is to sell weapons to]{.underline}** **[just about any
nation]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that can afford them]{.underline}**
**[[without]{.mark} much [concern for]{.mark} the
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Though the United States does
limit its most advanced weapons to allies16 and maintains a ban on the
sale of materials related to weapons of mass destruction,17 the United
States has sold just about everything else, in many cases to countries
embroiled in interstate and civil conflicts, to countries with
horrendous human rights records, and to countries that represent a risk
for entangling the United States in unwanted conflicts.

**[[Thanks]{.mark} in part [to]{.mark}]{.underline}** this
**[[congressional apathy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[the [risk
assessment]{.mark} requirement [has]{.mark} generally]{.underline}**
[**[not restrained]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**

**[from]{.underline}** [**[selling weapons]{.underline}** **[even to
countries that should not receive them.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[On
paper, the AECA dictates a reasonable bar for]{.underline}** the **[risk
assessment.]{.underline}** The law states: "Decisions on issuing export
licenses ... shall take into account whether the export of the article
would contribute to an arms race, aid in the development of weapons of
mass destruction, support international terrorism, increase the
possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict, or prejudice the
development of bilateral or multilateral arms control or
nonproliferation agreements or other arrangements."28

Administrations have also highlighted the importance of avoiding arms
sales that would lead to negative outcomes. The most recent presidential
directive on arms sales, Barack Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 27
from January 2014, identifies a host of criteria to be included in risk
assessments and declares that "All arms transfer decisions will be
guided by a set of criteria that maintains the appropriate balance
between legitimate arms transfers to support U.S. national security and
that of our allies and partners, and the need for restraint against the
transfer of arms that would enhance the military capabilities of hostile
states, serve to facilitate human rights abuses or violations of
international humanitarian law, or otherwise undermine international
security."29

**[[The track record]{.mark} of U.S. arms sales,]{.underline}**
**[however]{.underline}**, **[[illustrates]{.mark} that [the

**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[has [transferred weapons]{.mark} into situations [where it
was]{.mark}]{.underline}** relatively **[[easy to

consequences was high]{.underline}**. In most cases, however,

**[longer-term possibilities]{.underline}**.

### Congress\-\--A2: Congress Fails\-\--Bad Policy

#### Congressional participation's key to stable and effective policy

**Hamilton 3** -- Lee H. Hamilton, Director of the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars and Member of the House for 34 Years,
2003 (The Next American Century Edited by Jeffrey T. Bergner) p. 60

Although congress sometimes acts irresponsibly in foreign policy, it can­
and often does-play a constructive role. Congress brings many strengths
to the foreign policy process. [[As the most representative
branch]{.mark} of govern­ment, [it reflects]{.mark} like no other
institution the [diverse views]{.mark} of the American people. [Congress
can mediate]{.mark} the various [perspectives]{.mark} of Americans
[and]{.mark} help to [shape]{.mark} them into a
[consensus]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Congress is]{.mark} also the [most accessible]{.mark} branch of
government]{.underline}. Ordinary Americans cannot easily reach
policymakers in the executive branch, but they can contact their
representative or senator, and expect at least to be lis­tened to.
[[That]{.mark} accessibility [keeps]{.mark} Congress [in touch]{.mark}
with the American peo­ple [and helps ensure]{.mark} that [foreign policy
reflects]{.mark} their [concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Additionally, [[Congress can]{.mark} usually help to [refine
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The president may not always appreciate
having 535 national security advisors, but [[con­gressional advice
is]{.mark} often constructive and [helpful]{.mark}. Since members of
Congress do not serve at the president\'s pleasure, [they are in a
better posi­tion]{.mark} than his aides [to offer]{.mark} unvarnished
[criticism]{.mark} of his policies. Congress can also play a useful role
by [forcing]{.mark} the president and top administration [offi­cials to
articulate]{.mark} and explain [policy]{.mark}, and by helping the
president educate the American people about foreign policy
challenges]{.underline}.

### Congress\-\--A2: Congress Fails\-\--Interference

#### [Interference]{.underline} is [inevitable]{.underline}\-\--building Congressional [power]{.underline} concentrates expertise and improves coordination

**Shaw 12** -- John T. Shaw, Vice President and Congressional
Correspondent for Market News International, Richard G. Lugar, Statesman
of the Senate: Crafting Foreign Policy from Capitol Hill, p. 47-48

Hamilton contends that [the [foreign policy capacity of Congress has
grown]{.mark}]{.underline} both more sophisticated and [[more
**fractured**]{.mark} in recent decades. [Congress challenges]{.mark}
the president more [frequently, but]{.mark} often [in **incoherent** or
**poorly coordinated** ways]{.mark}. Part of the
**[confusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, he writes, [[is due to]{.mark} the
**[splintering]{.mark} of [power]{.mark}** in Congress. Congressional
foreign policy [work is]{.mark} now **[spread out]{.mark}** among dozens
of committees [rather than **concentrated** in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
two main foreign policy [[committees that have]{.underline}]{.mark}
traditionally [contained the greatest]{.underline} foreign policy
**[[expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To the extent that foreign policy
power is concentrated, it resides in the appropriations committees in
which international concerns are usually secondary to domestic political
and fiscal concerns. He notes that the House and Senate foreign affairs
committees have not passed comprehensive legislation authorizing U.S.
foreign assistance programs since 1985. He believes this is because
committee members often want to avoid making decisions on controversial
foreign policy matters and administrations aren\'t eager to encourage
Congress to use these bills to oiler restrictive riders to authorizing
legislation. Consequently, [important foreign policy issues are now
frequently decided as part of enormous omnibus spending bills that are
drafted near the end of]{.underline} congressional [sessions by a small
number of]{.underline} congressional [leaders]{.underline} and stall and
the White House.

[Congressional foreign policy [power is]{.mark} **further
[dissipated]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the [growing]{.mark} tendency of
Congress to form [**ad hoc caucuses** on]{.mark} issues such as
[**trade**, **terrorism**, and the **environment**]{.mark}. This
[fragmentation]{.mark} of power has [made it]{.mark} all the more
[difficult]{.mark} for Congress [to develop]{.mark} a foreign policy
[consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hamilton concludes that all of [these
changes have made Congress]{.underline} more representative, assertive,
[fractured, and inconsistent on foreign policy. [Congress
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} the president\'s [[authority]{.mark} far
more [often]{.mark}]{.underline} today than it did four decades ago,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} it often [acts [**rashly** and]{.mark} speaks
[in \"a **cacophony of conflicting voices**.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}1

#### Uninformed congressional involvement is the status quo -- the plan builds congressional knowledge and expertise that checks the president to create a coherent foreign policy

**Hamilton 99** (Lee, Director of the Center on Congress at Indiana
University, "Foreign Policy Consultation between the President and
Congress," Oct 14,
<http://www.centeroncongress.org/foreign-policy-consultation-between-president-and-congress>)

[[American foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline} always [[has **more force
and punch**]{.underline}]{.mark} to it [[when the President and Congress
speak with one voice.]{.mark} [Congress]{.mark}]{.underline} is our most
representative branch of government. It [best [articulates]{.mark} the
[concerns of different]{.mark} segments of the [population]{.mark}.
[When the President takes these views into consideration]{.mark} in
formulating foreign policy, the [policy]{.mark} that results [is more
likely to have]{.mark} strong public [support]{.mark}. And foreign
policy with strong domestic [support makes the U.S. **more respected and
effective**]{.mark} abroad. [Consultation **fosters mutual
trust**]{.mark} between the President and Congress, [and encourages them
to **develop**]{.mark} **our [foreign policy
together]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It]{.mark} helps [prevent]{.mark} the
[branches from taking]{.mark} our foreign [policy **in two different
directions**, and discourages]{.mark} Congress from
[micro-managing]{.mark} programs [out of frustration]{.mark} from being
excluded]{.underline}. Consultation does not \-- and should not \--
ensure agreement between the branches[. Differences will
remain]{.underline}, especially on the toughest issues.
[But]{.underline} even on those tough issues, [[consultation will
smooth]{.mark} some of the hard edges of
[disagreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, and refine and strengthen our
policy. [Consultation]{.underline} with Congress [provides the President
with a wider range of perspectives]{.underline} than he may receive from
his own advisers. [[The President is isolated]{.underline}]{.mark} in
our system of government. Unlike the British Prime Minister, [he rarely
faces]{.underline} his [critics]{.underline} face-to-face. No one, as
George Reedy once said, tells the President to go soak his head. Cabinet
officials and other high-ranking advisers serve at his pleasure. Their
jobs depend on his favor, and they usually can decipher the direction in
which the President wants to go. Members of [Congress]{.underline} do
not serve at the President\'s favor. Their [independence from the
President gives their advice added weight. The [President may
not]{.mark} like, or [take]{.mark}, the [advice]{.mark} of Congress,
[but]{.mark} his **[consideration]{.mark} of it is likely to [produce
better policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consultation is necessary because
the Constitution gives foreign policy powers to both the President and
Congress. The President is the commander-in-chief and head of the
executive branch. [[Congress has the power to declare war]{.mark} and
the power of the purse]{.underline}. The President has the power to
negotiate treaties, but the Senate must ratify them. [Given this shared
responsibility for foreign policy, **[the branches must work together in
order for]{.mark} our [foreign policy to have
coherence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The ideal is]{.underline} not an
identity of views between the branches, but [a **[creative
tension]{.mark}** out of which [emerge]{.mark} policies that best
reflect]{.underline} American [national interests]{.underline} and the
views of the American people. Edwin Corwin, the great constitutional
scholar, noted that the Constitution is an invitation for the President
and Congress to struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign
policy. Seen from this perspective, [tug-of-wars between the branches
are just what the founding fathers ordered]{.underline}. But too often
our government\'s battles over our policy are destructive, rather than
constructive. [[Improved consultation could go a long way]{.mark} toward
strengthening American foreign policy.]{.underline} The most prominent
examples of poor consultation in recent history are the
[Vietnam]{.underline} War of the 1960s [and]{.underline} \'70s and the
Contra War in [Nicaragua]{.underline} of the 1980s. Both became major
political controversies, and had serious political repercussions for the
Johnson, Nixon and Reagan administrations. These examples [stand out
because consultation was]{.underline} not simply poor, but was
[intentionally poor]{.underline}, because the [administrations wanted to
conceal information from Congress]{.underline} and the public. In both
cases, [policy was controlled by a small group of high-level
officials]{.underline}, and few others either inside or outside the
executive branch knew the full extent of our government\'s activities.
[Administrations viewed Congress]{.underline} in these instances [as a
nuisance]{.underline} to be avoided, [rather than]{.underline} as [a
partner]{.underline} in the formulation of policy. Reagan administration
National Security Adviser John Poindexter stated in hearings about the
Iran-Contra scandal that he \"simply did not want any outside
interference\" from Congress. More recently, the Clinton administration
has consulted poorly on a number of important issues. Perhaps the most
politically damaging example involved our intervention in Somalia. In
October, 1993, eighteen American soldiers were killed in Somalia during
a botched military operation. The tragedy created a media furor, which
called for some explanation. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and
Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Capitol Hill to brief
Members on what had happened, but the briefing failed to explain how the
administration planned to proceed. No real consultation took place
because the administration had no policy proposals to discuss. The
briefing inflamed congressional criticism of the administration\'s
policy, and cost Les Aspin his job. Consultation has not been good on
our military involvement in Bosnia and Kosovo. Following the end of the
war in Bosnia, in late 1995, the Clinton administration decided the U.S.
would participate in a NATO-led deployment of peacekeepers. The
administration did not adequately consult Congress on the decision, and
the President did not explain in a comprehensive manner the purpose of
our engagement. The President also misled Congress by saying the
deployment would only be for a year, even though such a short time frame
was unrealistic. Then, one year later, while Congress was out of session
after the 1996 election, the President decided to continue the
deployment of U.S. troops in Bosnia for another year and a half. Many in
Congress believed the decision was intentionally made at a time when
Congress could not oppose it. The administration managed to get its way
on this issue despite poor consultation, but it paid a high price in
lost good will of many Members. During the crisis in Kosovo, [the
administration only consulted sporadically]{.underline} with Congress
prior to the start of the NATO military action against Serb targets last
spring. Once NATO began its air campaign, the administration struggled
to gain congressional support, in part because of distrust remaining
from the experience with our policy in Bosnia. [The President exerted
strong]{.underline} public and diplomatic [leadership]{.underline} in
support of the NATO effort, [but]{.underline} the [Congress never
authorized the action, and the lack of firm congressional backing
weakened the President\'s]{.underline} and NATO\'s
[position]{.underline} in the war. On other issues, poor consultation
has prevented the Clinton administration from achieving its policy
goals. This has been the case with its efforts to obtain funding for the
United Nations and ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
The administration has worked to build congressional support on these
issues, but the efforts have been sporadic and occasional. They have not
been sustained. The President, in particular, has not been sufficiently
involved in rallying support. On the test ban treaty, the administration
did not expend enough energy and resources on consultation over the past
two years, and then was unprepared to deal with the strong congressional
opposition when the Senate finally took up the treaty during the past
two weeks. The result was Senate rejection of one of the most important
foreign policy initiatives of the Clinton administration. Deficiencies
in the consultative process [These [examples]{.mark}]{.underline} of
poor consultation [[point to a]{.mark} [number of]{.mark} common
executive branch [shortcomings]{.mark} in the consultative
process]{.underline}. Often [[Congress is only]{.mark}
[informed]{.mark}]{.underline} of executive branch decisions, [rather
than]{.underline} genuinely [consulted]{.underline}. Members of Congress
are notified of decisions after they have already been made, or they are
provided with only limited information. I have often heard an
administration come to Congress and insist there was no alternative to a
decision it has made \-- when, in fact, it was a 55/45 decision within
the administration. There are always options in foreign policy.
[Executive branch officials tend to treat Congress as an obstacle to be
overcome, rather than as a potential partner. Many]{.underline}
officials [believe that Congress is ignorant of]{.underline}
sophisticated [foreign policy issues]{.underline} and only gets in the
way of good policy. They avoid consulting with Congress until
circumstances \-- like a disclosure in the media \-- force them to.
Administrations are especially reluctant to hear from Members in an
open-ended discussion. They prefer highly-structured, almost
ritualistic, hearings, if they must deal with Congress in some form.
Consultation tends to take place only when a crisis is at hand, and is
not sustained. On many complex foreign policy issues,
**[[administrations must build]{.mark} in [Congress a strong base of
knowledge over]{.mark} a period of [years so]{.mark} that [Members are
well-informed]{.mark} [when the issue comes up]{.mark} for a vote or
becomes publicly discussed.]{.underline}** [But administrations rarely
consult Congress on issues that are not on their immediate
agenda]{.underline}. Members are then taken by surprise when the
administration suddenly requests support for something Congress has
heard nothing or hardly anything about. Successive administrations\'
failure to educate and consult Members on international financial
institutions is a classic case \-- no wonder it was so difficult for the
Clinton administration to get congressional approval for an \$18 billion
IMF quota increase. Consultation is often driven by headlines. Sometimes
administrations call Members to give them a \"heads-up\" on an issue
because it will be appearing in the newspapers the next day. These
heads-ups are self-serving; consultation on the eve of a press leak is
not consultation at all. Administrations sometimes authorize only a few
officials to discuss our policy. In several periods of crisis, I was
distressed to learn that only three or four officials were trusted by
the President to consult \-- at a time when administration spokespeople
should have been consulting all over Capitol Hill. During the months
leading up to the Gulf War, only the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of
State, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were authorized by
President Bush to discuss policy on Iraq with Members of Congress. The
executive branch often consults with only a limited number of Members.
To be effective, consultation must target different Members depending on
the issue - for instance, focusing on the ad hoc Caucus on Ireland when
dealing with a matter pertaining to Northern Ireland. Members with a
strong interest in a particular foreign policy issue are sometimes left
out of an administration\'s consultation on that issue. The
administration does not always do a good job of recognizing which
Members are concerned with which issues.

### Congress\-\--A2: Not Key

#### Congress needs to take back its powers now

columnist, writes across a broad range of topics. Edwards represented

MLC)

It's hard to remember anything from fifth-grade civics class, but a
couple of ideas stuck: separation of powers and the "power of the
purse." I remember that **[[Congress makes the laws, the president
executes the laws, and the Supreme Court interprets
them]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- we even had a song. I remember that
Congress decides how much to spend and what to spend it on, and the
president spends it**[. These were [straightforward concepts]{.mark}
right up until President [Trump declared a national emergency upon his
failure to get Congress to fund his border wall.]{.mark} [Today would be
a good day for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority; and it
has the tools to do it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This president is not the
first to stretch the limits of the Constitution by stepping into Article
I territory to expand executive authority. Some have argued that
beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, **[each successive
president has encroached further on the legislative branch, sidelining
the most directly elected representatives of the people on some of the
nation's most pressing issues]{.underline}** --- from wars to
immigration policy to building roads and bridges. Historian Michael
Beschloss documented the erosion of Congress's war powers in his recent
book, "Presidents of War." Harry S. Truman tried to nationalize the
steel industry during the Korea War, until the Supreme Court slapped him
back. Members of Ronald Reagan's administration famously waged wars in
Central America without congressional authorization, and funded them by
moving money around hidden accounts. Barack Obama avoided congressional
authorization in Libya by narrowly defining "hostilities" and facing
little challenge from Congress. Congressional Republicans lost their
lunch when they thought Obama acted with extra-constitutional authority
on behalf of undocumented minors --- the "dreamers." And here we are. A
recent report by the Brennan Center for Justice highlights that of 59
national emergencies declared since 1979 (until now), only two were
domestic --- one in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the other
concerning swine flu. Most deal with prohibitions on foreign assets and
investments. **[[Until now, no national emergency has involved the
president using congressionally appropriated funds for unauthorized
activities when Congress has expressly said no.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
This fight is not just about war powers and emergency declarations or
even immigration. It's a fight to restore the balance of power that has
been lost over generations. On a more pedestrian note, Congress would go
a long way toward retrieving its "power of the purse" by restoring its
role in identifying transportation and infrastructure projects worthy of
federal funding. Congress long ago ceded many of its spending decisions
on infrastructure to the executive branch. **[That means that virtually
every federal transportation project is decided by the president with a
bucket of tax dollars. How does any president know what highway to
repair in Kansas or rail project to fund in California?]{.underline}**
The word "earmark" may have negative connotations, but, handled
transparently, it's just shorthand for elected representatives properly
addressing the needs of their constituents. On environmental
stewardship, the executive branch decides what and when to mine on
public lands and then reports to Congress after the fact. The current
administration is systematically dismantling the Environmental
Protection Agency and changing decades of environmental policy using its
broad regulatory authority. **[[It's time for Congress to take back its
power.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As to this immediate outrage, the House
should pass a resolution to terminate Trump's declaration, despite
facing a steep climb in the Senate and the likelihood of a veto. The
veto is not important --- **[what's important is Congress standing up
for its status.]{.underline}** It should also press its case in court.
While others, from state attorneys general to border ranchers, will also
pursue in the courts, Congress has the responsibility to demonstrate
harm to its institutional authority and its role as guardian of the
nation's purse. Already under Speaker Nancy Pelosi's leadership, House
committee chairs have begun reclaiming oversight and demanding executive
accountability on the environment, national security, immigration and
health care. That's just the beginning. In the upcoming 2020
appropriations process**[, Congress should close the lid on pots of
money sprinkled throughout the budget that enable any president to
"find" funding Congress does not intend.]{.underline}** It should
examine the 123 statutory powers the Brennan Center has documented that
are at the president's disposal under a national emergency: Some have
not been reviewed in decades, and several "national emergencies" that
are technically still in effect have either lapsed or Congress has never
signed off on them. This is not good governance. **[[It is time for
Congress --- House and Senate --- to overturn every stone to reclaim its
authority and meet its constitutional
responsibility.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Congress\-\--A2: Not Zero Sum

#### Excessive presidential powers leaves little space for Congress

**Newell 17** (Terry Newell, director of Leadership for a Responsible
Society and author of three books, 10/22/2017, "Too Much Presidential
Power? - Too Little Congress,"

A **[[tyrannical George]{.underline}]{.mark}** III
**[still]{.underline}** fresh **[[on their minds]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the **[Constitution's [framers fashioned Congress as the dominant branch
of government]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[To make sure he knew his
place, it rejected kingly titles, so]{.underline}**]{.mark} George
**[[Washington became]{.underline}]{.mark}** just **[[the
"president]{.mark}."]{.underline}** **[He [initially respected
this]{.mark}]{.underline}**, believing for example that he should only
veto a bill if he deemed it unconstitutional, not just because he didn't
like it. **[That [didn't last]{.mark}.]{.underline}** With the help of
Alexander Hamilton and an increasingly liberal interpretation of the
Constitution, [**[Washington soon dominated foreign affairs, defense,
and created a national financial system]{.underline}**.]{.mark} The
course of American **[[history has led most presidents to want more
power than the framers intended]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Republican
anger at President Obama and Democratic anger at President Trump for
executive over-reach should be seen in this historical
context]{.underline}**. But how much presidential power is too much?
Those worried about an "imperial" presidency point to the use of
Executive Orders. Until the mid-nineteenth century, presidents averaged
just two a year. President Obama was criticized for over-use, at a rate
of 34.6 per year. President Trump, critical of Obama for this, has a
current rate of 68.7 per year, reversing many of Obama's with his own.
As a matter of history, neither comes close to FDR (307.8) and Herbert
Hoover (242). **[Presidential "[signing statements" are another
concern.]{.mark} [The first 39 presidents issued only 75.]{.mark} [The
next three (Reagan, Bush, Clinton) issued 247]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By
**[the start of his last year, George W. Bush]{.underline}** had
**[issued 157,]{.underline}** challenging over 1,100 provisions of law,
**[leading to accusations that he was selectively enforcing the will of
Congress]{.underline}**. **[Federal regulation is another marker of
executive power]{.underline}**, as regulations assume the force of law.
Between 1949 and 2005, the Federal Register grew seven-fold to over
134,000 pages. The executive branch has taken upon itself a large
measure of legislative authority. The near-constant state of heightened
national security since 9/11 can also strengthen a president's hand.
James Madison made that point in 1793, saying that war is "the true
nurse of executive aggrandizement." **[If modern presidents have more
power than we are comfortable with, the courts are one antidote, as we
have seen with President's Trump's attempted travel bans. But the courts
are slow and sometimes inconclusive. A Congress jealous of its
constitutional prerogatives is the other corrective. [Presidential power
becomes easier]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and, presidents argue, more
necessary) **[[when Congress falters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In recent
decades, this has been cause for concern. For example, Congress has let
**[Presidents take the lead on immigration]{.underline}**, health care,
and the environment. It has ceded much trade authority and has weakened
its treaty powers by enabling presidents to create "executive
agreements" and other vehicles that require less than a two-thirds
vote - and in some cases no vote at all. In 1973, it passed the War
Powers Act to limit a president's ability to go to war - but has failed
to enforce it when ignored. **[The current Congress has allowed itself
to be ridiculed via demeaning tweets.]{.underline}** Perhaps not
surprisingly, a 2015 Gallup Poll found **[only eight percent of
Americans]{.underline}** with "quite a lot" or "a great deal" of
confidence in Congress, the lowest of 15 major U.S. institutions and a
drop of 16 points from its historical average. A diminished Congress
weakens our republican government. For example, the rejection by the
current president of the executive actions of his predecessor, who also
overturned many of the actions of his predecessor, leads to incoherent
domestic policy. **[[An exceptionally deferential Congress leaves
foreign policy - and potentially war - to the whims of one person,
clearly not at all what the framers wanted in 1787. Congress must fix
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Increasing polarization and refusal to
compromise; gerrymandering that encourages extremism by assuring the
winner of a party primary wins an election; big money that comes with
big payback expectations; failure to forge social ties to mitigate
partisan tensions; public derision of those with opposing views; the use
of "no" as a policy strategy; and a willingness to defer to the
executive are some of its failures. With very few notable exceptions,
such as Senator John McCain, individual members have also lacked the
moral courage to confront the president of their own party and call both
to a higher purpose. **[The framers did understand human nature would
lead each branch of government to seek power at the expense of the
others.]{.underline}** Their solution, explained by Madison in
Federalist #51, was that "\[A\]mbition must be made to counteract
ambition." It "consists in giving those who administer each department
the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist
encroachments of the others." **[[Congress does the nation a disservice
when it fails to faithfully execute its constitutional role. Presidents
go too far when Congress does not go far enough. Fixing the latter is
the best way to constrain the former.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The **[[liberal world order]{.underline}]{.mark}** that was created in
the aftermath of the Second World War **[is]{.underline}** today
**[[being challenged]{.mark} by]{.underline}** a **[variety of
forces]{.underline}** --- by powerful **[authoritarian governments and
anti-liberal fundamentalist movements]{.underline}**, as well as by
long-term shifts in the global economy. **[[Great power competition has
returned]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [**[In]{.underline}**
**[Europe]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
**[[launched]{.mark} the first [cross-border invasion]{.mark}
of]{.underline}** a **[neighboring country]{.underline}** since World
War II. **[[In]{.underline}]{.mark}** East
**[[Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[China]{.mark} is [expanding]{.mark}
its reach as a [military power]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[seeking]{.underline}** both economic and strategic **[hegemony at the
risk of [destabilizing]{.mark} that critical
[region]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[In]{.mark} the [Middle East]{.mark},
[Iran]{.mark} is [expanding]{.mark} its [influence]{.mark} and Islamic
[jihadists]{.mark} have [gained control of]{.mark} more
[territory]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the face of this turmoil, many
Americans have come to doubt whether there is anything the United States
can do or should do in response. Many assume either that it doesn't
matter very much what happens beyond America's shores or that the United
States no longer has the wisdom or capacity to shape events and prevent
others from doing what they please. Only seven years ago, **[[pundits
were talking of]{.mark} a "[post-American world]{.mark}," [with]{.mark}
a [declining U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} a remarkable
"[rise of the rest]{.mark}."]{.underline}** These days, however, **[that
[prognosis appears to have been]{.mark} at best
[premature]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Only seven years ago, pundits were
talking of a "post-American world," with a declining United States and a
remarkable "rise of the rest." These days, however, that prognosis
appears to have been at best premature. **[[America]{.mark} has
[substantially recovered from]{.mark} the]{.underline}** Great
**[[Recession]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while **[the once-heralded "[rise
of the rest]{.mark}" has [stalled]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Many around
the world who once decried American overseas involvement as "hegemonic"
now seek greater American engagement in international
affairs.]{.underline}** Widespread Support for US Actions Against ISIS
Pew Research Center: Support for U.S. Actions against ISIS
**[[Among]{.mark} the]{.underline}** American
**[[public]{.underline}]{.mark}**, too, **[there [are]{.mark} signs of
[greater receptivity to]{.mark} a [more active American]{.mark} global
[role]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What is missing for most Americans,
however, is a sense of strategy and purpose in American foreign policy.
During the Cold War, fear of the Soviet Union and international
communism did not always produce agreement on policy but did provide an
answer, for most, as to why the United States needed to play an
international role and what that role should be. Today, our **[political
leaders need to remind Americans that our [fundamental interests
are]{.mark} still [best served by upholding the world order]{.mark} ---
economic, political, and strategic]{.underline}** --- that was
established at the end of the Second World War and that was further
strengthened and entrenched by the revolutions of 1989. **[Americans
need to recognize their nation's central role in maintaining the present
international order and muster the will to use their still formidable
power and influence to support that order against its inevitable
challengers]{.underline}**. Supporting Democracy is a Matter of National
Security What will this require? Above all, **[it means working to shore
up all]{.underline}** three pillars -- politics, economics,
**[security]{.underline}** --- of what has **[made the American-led
world order so remarkable]{.underline}**. There is a tendency to
separate politics, economics, and security --- "ideals" from
"interests," support for democracy from defense of security --- but in
the present world order they have all been related. Start with the
reality that a world order that supports freedom will only be supported
by free nations. **[Supporting democracy]{.underline}** is not just a
matter of keeping faith with our own values. It **[is a matter of
national security]{.underline}**. Americans and other free peoples who
benefit from and support the present world order therefore have an
interest in supporting democracy where it exists and in pressing for
greater democratic reforms in the world's authoritarian nations,
including the two great power autocracies. Supporting democracy is not
just a matter of keeping faith with our own values. It is a matter of
national security. In their economic policies,
**[[America]{.mark}ns]{.underline}** need to **[continue promoting and
[strengthen]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** the **[international [free
trade]{.mark} and free market regime]{.underline}**. This, of course,
means setting their own economy back on a course of sustainable growth.
It means doing a better job of educating and training Americans to
compete with others in an increasingly competitive international
economy. It means providing a healthy environment for technological
innovation. But it also **[[means resisting protectionist
temptations]{.mark} and [using American
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, along with other free-trading nations,
**[[to push back]{.mark} against some of the tendencies of state
capitalism in China and elsewhere]{.underline}**. Gaining congressional
approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, and then moving to
agreement on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with
Europe, are critical, and not only for their economic benefits. They
also are a critical step in knitting the democratic world more closely
together. But it also means resisting protectionist temptations and
using American influence, along with other free-trading nations, to push
back against some of the tendencies of state capitalism in China and
elsewhere. In Asia, especially, this is more much than a trade issue.
Although the United States stands to benefit from the agreement, it is,
above all, a strategic issue. **[The United States and China are locked
in a competition across the spectrum of power and
influence.]{.underline}** Militarily, **[the [Chinese seek to deny
American access to]{.mark} the [region]{.mark} and [hope]{.mark} thereby
[to divide]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [from]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Economically, China would like to turn
Asia into a region of Chinese hegemony, where every key trade
relationship is with Beijing. In such a world, the United States is a
net loser --- providing costly security to allies but not much else,
while China reaps the economic rewards and grabs the hearts and minds,
and pocketbooks, of regional players. **[Finally, there is the matter of
American hard power]{.underline}**. What has been true since the time of
Rome remains true today: **[[there can be no world order]{.mark}
[without power to]{.mark} preserve it, to shape its norms, uphold its
institutions, defend the sinews of its economic system, and [keep the
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Military power]{.mark} can be abused,
wielded unwisely and ineffectively]{.underline}**. It can be deployed to
answer problems that it cannot answer or that have no answer.
**[But]{.underline}** **[it [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[No nation]{.underline}** or
group of nations **[that renounced power could expect to maintain any
kind of world order. [If]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[begins to look]{.mark} like a [less reliable]{.mark} [defender]{.mark}
of the present order, that [order will]{.mark} begin to
[unravel]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It remains true today as it has since
the Second World War that **[[only]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} the [capacity and]{.mark} the unique
[geographical advantages to provide]{.mark} [global
security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[There can be no stable balance of
power in Europe or Asia without]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**. And while we can talk about
**[[soft]{.mark} power [and smart power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, they
**[have been and [always will be of limited value]{.mark} [when
confronting]{.mark} raw [military]{.mark} power]{.underline}**. Despite
all of the loose talk of American decline, **[it is in the military
realm where U.S. advantages remain clearest]{.underline}**. Even in
other great power's backyards, **[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[retains]{.mark} the [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, along with its
powerful allies, **[[to deter challenges to]{.mark} the
[security]{.mark} order]{.underline}**. But **[[without]{.mark} a [U.S.
willingness to]{.mark} play the role of providing [balance]{.mark} in
far-flung regions of the world, the [system will buckle under]{.mark}
the unrestrained [military]{.mark} [competition of regional
powers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Without a U.S. willingness to play the
role of providing balance in far-flung regions of the world, the system
will buckle under the unrestrained military competition of regional
powers. Today, as a result of the Budget Control Act and a general
unwillingness to spend adequately on defense, America's ability to play
this vital role is coming increasingly under question. Current defense
spending has created a readiness crisis within the armed forces. Only a
handful of Army brigades are available for use in a crisis. The army is
about to be forced to cut 40,000 soldiers from its active force. There
are too few ships to provide a U.S. presence in the multiple hotspots
that have sprouted up around the world. As the bipartisan,
congressionally-mandated National Defense Panel has argued, **[the [U.S.
military must be able to deter or stop aggression]{.mark} in multiple
theaters]{.underline}**, not just one, even when engaged in a
large-scale war. **[It [needs to]{.mark} be able to [fight ISIS]{.mark}
and [deter Iran]{.mark} in the Middle East, [deter Russia]{.mark} in
Europe and Syria, and in Asia deter [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and
maintain stability in]{.mark} the [face of]{.mark} a [rising
China]{.mark}. Consider the threat]{.underline}** now **[posed by
Iran]{.underline}**. Whatever one thinks about the recently-concluded
nuclear deal, **[any serious [strategy aimed at resisting Iranian
domination]{.mark} also [requires confronting Iran on]{.mark} the
several fronts of [the]{.mark} Middle East [battlefield]{.mark}. In
Syria, it requires a determined policy to remove Iran's close
ally]{.underline}**, Basher al-Assad, **[[using U.S. air power]{.mark}
to provide cover for civilians and creating a safe zone for Syrians
willing to fight]{.underline}**. **[In Iraq, it [requires]{.mark} using
[American forces to]{.mark} push back and [destroy]{.mark} the forces of
[the Islamic State]{.mark} so that we do not have to
rely]{.underline}**, de facto, **[on Iranian power]{.underline}** to do
the job. Overall, **[it requires a greater U.S. military
commitment]{.underline}** to the region, a reversal of both the
perceived and the real withdrawal of American power. And therefore it
requires a reversal of the downward trend in U.S. defense spending,
which has made it harder for the military even to think about addressing
these challenges, should it be called upon to do so. The challenge we
face today is to decide whether this liberal world order is worth
defending and whether the United States is still willing to play the
role of its principal champion. The answer to both questions ought to be
"yes," but **[[it will require]{.mark} a renewal of [American
leadership]{.mark} in the international system, economically,
politically, [and]{.mark} strategically]{.underline}**. **[It will also
require a [renewed understanding of how important]{.mark} and unique
[the]{.mark} present [liberal]{.mark} world [order is]{.mark}, both for
Americans and for peoples all across the globe]{.underline}**. The
simple fact is that for all the difficulties and suffering of the past
70 years, the period since the end of World War II has been unique in
the history of the human race. The period since the end of World War II
has been unique in the history of the human race. Democratic government,
once rare, has spread to over 100 nations around the world, on every
continent, for peoples of all races and religions. **[There has been an
unprecedented growth in prosperity]{.underline}**. **[Billions have been
lifted out of poverty]{.underline}**. Democratic government, once rare,
has spread to over 100 nations around the world, on every continent, for
peoples of all races and religions. Although the period has been marked
by war, peace among the great powers has been preserved. There has been
no recurrence of the two devastating world wars of the first half of the
20th century. This world order has been a boon for billions around the
world, but it has also served American interests. **[[Any]{.mark} [other
world order]{.mark}, one [in which the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[had to cede power]{.mark} and influence to China and
Russia]{.underline}**, or what **[[is]{.mark} more
likely]{.underline}**, **[[a descent into
disorder]{.underline}]{.mark}**, is unlikely to serve Americans'
interests as well.

The Argument

This paper views the international system with geographical and
geopolitical eyes. For this reason, it uses geographical facts as
factors in analyzing the current global system and its future prospects.
The argument this paper will promote is that the **[U.S. [physical
location]{.mark} and geopolitical position]{.underline}** are the
cornerstones of its foreign policy and **[[serve as a \"safety
net\"]{.mark} from foreign]{.underline}** powers\'
**[assaults]{.underline}** (not perfect, obviously, as became painfully
clear on September 11, 2001). The **[U.S., unlike any
other]{.underline}** great or **[superpower]{.underline}** -- now or
anytime -- **[can decide whether]{.underline}** or not and to what
extent **[will it be involved in international affairs]{.underline}**.
Isolationism was a practical policy (regardless of its success) for
approximately twenty years since the end of World War I until Pearl
Harbor (1941). Even though since the end of World War II the United
States is conducting an opposite strategy, theoretically and
hypothetically it can be resumed, perhaps not to the extent it was in
the 1920s-1930s, but a sort of isolationism is possible. No other
country can afford such a policy because all other powers are on the
same continent and cannot disregard one another.

Moreover, the **[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** is still -- and **[[will
remain]{.mark} in the foreseeable future -- [the naval
superpower]{.mark} with]{.underline}** the most powerful navy that has
the **[best power-projection capabilities]{.underline}**. It can afford
to leave the continent and become an offshore balancer. **[True, it will
lose some]{.underline}** of its **[influence, but it can
preserve]{.underline}** its **[power on the sea and project
it]{.underline}** restrictedly **[whenever needed]{.underline}**. So,
very briefly, the **[[U.S. has]{.mark} a much wider room for maneuver
than]{.underline}** is **[presumed, and with [the most powerful military
with no parallel]{.mark} in the foreseeable future]{.underline}**, the
U.S. still has a wide spectrum of policies it can use, **[[hence]{.mark}
it is in [the best position for]{.mark} the [coming]{.mark} hegemonic
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Literature Review

It is important to note that most of the literature is American, which
is expected and logical, but also somewhat problematic due to obvious
biases. One of these is the obsession with China, as it is the focus of
most studies but seems more frightening than in reality. The obsession
with China leaves out analyses of the rise of other great powers,
therefore the literature cannot really establish that the alternative to
unipolarity is multipolarity. The studies that focus on China seem to
implement that the next system will be bipolar. To its credit, though,
it seems that **[there is no power]{.underline}** that is **[emerging as
much as China]{.underline}** does, hence it is correct to focus on it.
But then, will other powers be entitled to be regarded as poles? This is
an extra-regional question with significant implications to East Asia in
a global context. The literature regarding the structure of the
international system can be divided into two major types:

A. By the source of threat to the U.S. primacy (future structure): 1.
The China alarmists (bipolarity); 2. The BRICS are emerging
(multipolarity); 3. Who cares? The American advance is too large to
catch up (unipolarity).

B. By the effect on U.S. behavior: 1. Fight to preserve primacy --
preemption or prevention; 2. Get used to it -- selective engagement or
offshore balancing.

Within the Realist paradigm there are two competing theories that
prescribe conflicting advice that is based on contradictory readings of
reality.12 Whereas offensive realism suggests securing material power
that will guarantee a given country\'s security, and securing regional
and global primacy even by force,13 defensive realism suggests
possessing sufficient material power and prefers some sort of power
sharing to enhance mutual trust among the great powers, which enhances
-- they believe -- the security of each power.14 In the American case,
defensive realism suggests offshore balancing or selective engagement,
while offensive realism would prefer domination and engagement with
potential rivals. This does not mean that there cannot be agreement
among all realists concerning American actions, such as the consensus
among many realists that the war against Iraq in 2003 was unnecessary
and even damaging.15 The disagreements grow and are much more acute
regarding other great powers. How should the U.S. treat China and other
emerging or reemerging powers? Should they be engaged? Should the U.S.
prevent the foreseen competition by striking first, or should the U.S.
allow them to emerge as regional hegemons and then divide the world into
spheres of influence with them?

The question everyone asks is whether or not American hegemony is over
or when will it happen. Ian Clark suggests that the term hegemony is
misused, and prefers questioning the future of American primacy.16 This
paper will follow Clark in terminology and substance.

Schweller and Pu say that \"If a great transformation is coming, it is
not one that heralds a radically altered world politics based on
legalism, constitutionalism, or global civic activism. Rather, it is a
structural transformation from unipolarity to multipolarity that most
realists believe promises a return to the familiar history of great
powers struggling for power and prestige.\"17 **[There definitely seems
to be [a transition]{.mark}, but is it [to multipolarity]{.mark} or
bipolarity]{.underline}**, and in any case -- will it resemble past
experiences? **[This [is highly uncertain]{.mark}. The power that the
U.S. had obtained]{.underline}** in the last several decades **[places
it in a different category than any other great power in the foreseeable
future, therefore [even if the U.S. is less dominant]{.mark} compared to
other great powers, [it is far fetching to argue]{.mark} for [similar
status]{.mark} as in any previous system]{.underline}**. This is not to
say that later in the future **[such a system]{.underline}** might
emerge, but **[in the near future it is unlikely]{.underline}**.18

Robert Art argued in 2010 that the **[[U.S. is]{.mark} the [most
powerful]{.mark} state [in]{.mark} the world in [economic and military
assets and will remain]{.mark} the most powerful military power [\"for
some time]{.mark} to come]{.underline}**,\" but inevitably its edge
relative to other great powers will diminish in the coming decades.
China is the greatest potential rival, provided that its economy will
continue to grow in the coming two decades as it did in the last two
decades (then it will surpass the U.S. in its GDP, but not in its GDP
per capita). For now, **[[China]{.mark} had]{.underline}** already
**[[changed the balance]{.mark} of power]{.underline}** in East Asia. It
is already the region\'s dominant military land power. Art assesses that
if China invests in its military forces for several decades, and is
determined to project naval and air power, it will be able to deploy a
naval force that \"could contest the American supremacy at sea in East
Asia.\"19 **[Some conflict seems inevitable]{.underline}**, including
arms race, **[[but there can be more cooperation than]{.mark} is
[assumed]{.mark} by most scholars]{.underline}**.

Art correctly argues that **[as long as China\'s]{.underline}** emerging
**[hegemony]{.underline}** in East Asia **[does not include Japan and
the U.S. maintains strongholds in]{.underline}** the region
(**[Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia), the]{.underline}**
geopolitical **[threat from China will not be of similar extent as that
of the Soviet Union. China cannot jeopardize the global balance of
power]{.underline}** as long as Europe, the Persian Gulf, India, Japan
and Russia are independent or under U.S. influence.20 China cannot
threaten the U.S. as the Soviet Union did due to its relative size. His
conclusion: be smart; let China grow but draw a line in the sand, accept
that it is growing but make sure China knows the U.S. is stronger.

This seems as good advice, but one need only to see China\'s increasing
defense budget to understand why apparently following it is a difficult
job. China had increased the defense budget by 11.2% in 2012, following
two decades of annual two-figure percents increases (since 1989, except
for 2009 -- only 7.5%).21 There are always questions on the purpose of
this steady increase: in preparation for a global conflict with the U.S.
over resources and political interests (i.e., preparing China to become
a rival pole); a regional conflict with any of its neighbors -- and
China indeed has issues with all of them, be it territorial, historical,
economic, etc.; or domestic, preparing to crush separatists or rebels.

In 2001, Mearsheimer wrote that \"American policy \[on China\] has
sought to integrate China into the world economy and facilitate its
rapid economic development, so that it becomes wealthy and, one would
hope, content with its present position in the international system.
This U.S. policy is misguided. A wealthy China would not be a status quo
power but an aggressive state determined to achieve regional
hegemony.... Although it is certainly in China\'s interest to be the
hegemon in Northeast Asia, it is clearly not in America\'s interest to
have that happen.... It is not too late for the United States to reverse
course and do what it can to slow the rise of China.\"22

A decade after Mearsheimer\'s warning, it seems that he was partly
correct and partly wrong. A steadily increasing share of China\'s wealth
is turned into military power, and recently, it is reported, Chinese
strategists apparently began calling their government to fit China\'s
foreign policy to its capabilities, which means replacing the \"peaceful
rise\" and the \"low profile policy\" with a much more ambitious
policy.23 But China\'s economic rise will first need to finance its
aging population. Nevertheless, China\'s goals are unclear to American
and western analysts and policymakers, although there are official
Chinese documents that allow assessing their true aims.24

It is interesting to follow China\'s rise to hegemony in East Asia and
the reaction of its neighbors. They were expected to act to balance
China, but according to Chan\'s study, they don\'t. The defense burden
is not rising and trade with China is increasing -- contrary to the
theoretical expectations.25 This can indicate either that China
succeeded in splitting among its regional rivals, or that the U.S. is no
longer functioning as a regional hegemon, therefore they have no one to
turn to against China.

Michael Beckley provides a detailed analysis of the rise of China and of
the U.S. decline or non-decline.26 Most declinists, as Beckley labels
them, argue that the U.S. is in economic decline, not in military
decline.27 This is an important point -- in military terms the U.S. is
still the sole superpower, and it is hard to see circumstances under
which the U.S. would lose this status. The **[American [spending on
defense is still higher than]{.mark}]{.underline}** that of
**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[potential [rivals
combined]{.mark}, and]{.underline}** even if the tipping point is coming
closer and China will surpass the U.S. in defense expenditure, **[it
will take many years for China to close the gap -- qualitative and
quantitative.]{.underline}** Unlike money, **[military assets do not
vanish]{.underline}** (it is hard to imagine an aircraft carrier simply
disappear or being given or sold to China). Therefore, **[[even
if]{.underline}]{.mark}** the U.S.
**[[expenditure]{.underline}]{.mark}** on defense **[[decreases, it does
not affect]{.underline}]{.mark}** American military
**[[primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at least **[in the short
run]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, the bond between economy and military
affairs is very strong. For instance, in April 2012 senior U.S.
officials admitted that there is no budget to strike Syria, therefore
the solution of the turmoil would have to be diplomatic.28

Mario Carranza mentions that those who argue that the U.S. **[[hegemony
is not in decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** claim that **[neither China nor
Europe can shape events]{.underline}** on the basis of their material
power, but he also argues that they underestimate China\'s (and to
lesser extent, Europe\'s) ability to take control over markets in the
Global South (South America and South Asia), and mentions that China
increased dramatically its economic relations with key South American
countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.29

Daniel Drezner presents the economic aspect of China\'s rise, and
focuses on its new status as the U.S.\'s greatest debt holder.30 This
issue is political no less and probably more than economic. But part of
being proof that in the age of globalization that the U.S. promoted so
powerfully it lost the economic primacy (and there are counterarguments
on this), does it make a real difference? After all, had the U.S. lost
any military asset due to its economic decline? Had any such asset been
sold to China? Of course not. Hence, the balance in hard power is quite
clear: China possesses the major part of American dollars in the world
and is America\'s largest creditor and debt holder, but the U.S. had not
lost any of its military power, and it is still superior to any other
power, especially China.

Hart and Jones assert that **[the U.S. [economy is]{.mark} still [three
times larger than]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline}** one.31 But
still, there is change in the degree of influence each power has in the
system. \"China, for instance, has long been a 'sovereignty hawk',
generally opposing the notion that interventions for humanitarian
purposes are legitimate. Its model of authoritarian capitalism has also
increasingly become an ideological export, challenging the United
States' liberal model.\"32 Russia is perhaps misplaced in the list of
emerging powers. Its economic data are not really improving and its
population is declining annually by 4%, and with this rate it might drop
to less than 120 million by 2050 compared to 140 million today.33

This sample of **[scholarly literature]{.underline}** of the last decade
**[demonstrates]{.underline}** the **[confusion regarding the current
situation]{.underline}**, although in recent years it is clearer that
there is a significant decline in American economic primacy. However,
**[[it seems clear to all]{.mark} that [the U.S.]{.mark} still [holds
military primacy and]{.mark}]{.underline}** in this aspect primacy
**[[does not seem]{.mark} to be [jeopardized for many years]{.mark} to
come]{.underline}**.34

[Copied](http://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/trump-has-foreign-policy-strategy)
For two weeks, the White House has unleashed a foreign-policy
blitzkrieg, and Washington's chattering classes are shocked and, if not
awed, at least perplexed. CNN calls Trump's actions [a
"u-turn."](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/politics/trump-russia-china-nato-syria/)
Bloomberg opts for the more mathematical "180 degree turn," while the
*Washington Post* [goes with
"flipflop."](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-27/trump-s-180-degree-turn-on-china-policy)
Meanwhile, pundits switched from decrying the president as an
isolationist [to lambasting
him](https://consortiumnews.com/2017/04/10/neocons-have-trump-on-his-knees/)
as a tool of the neocons. Amid all the relabeling, explanations of [an
"emerging Trump
Doctrine"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/us/politics/trump-doctrine-foreign-policy.html)
have proliferated faster than North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Here's my
take on what's going on: • Yes, [[there is a method to Trump's
"madness.]{.mark}"]{.underline} • No, there has been no big change in
Trump's strategy. [The [actions that flustered
those]{.mark}]{.underline} who thought they had pigeon-holed Donald
Trump [simply [reflect]{.mark} the [impulses **that have driven the
direction**]{.mark} **of this presidency [since before]{.mark} the
[convention]{.mark} in Cleveland**]{.underline}**. At the Center of the
Storm** [Where is the [head]{.mark} and heart [of]{.mark} the
president's national-[security team]{.mark}?]{.underline} Ask that
question a year ago, and the answer would have been simple: General Mike
Flynn, Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Senator Jeff Sessions. Today, Flynn is
gone. Giuliani never went in. Sessions is still a crucial voice in the
administration, but his duties as Attorney General deal only partially
with foreign policy and national-security matters. The new team centers
round Jim [[Mattis at]{.mark} the [Defense]{.mark}
Department]{.underline}, Rex [[Tillerson]{.underline}]{.mark} at the
State Department, John [[Kelly]{.underline}]{.mark} at the Department of
Homeland Security [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} H. R. [[McMaster]{.mark} in
the West Wing---ably assisted by Nikki Haley at the United
Nations.]{.underline} Trump barely knew these people before the
election. [**[There is little question]{.mark}** that the new
**[team's]{.mark}**]{.underline} character and [[**competence**
**affected**]{.mark} the **[White House response]{.mark}** to the recent
string of high profile events]{.underline} and activities---from
presidential meetings with Egypt and China and Tillerson's tête-à-tête
with Putin, to the ominous developments in Syria and North Korea. Though
on the job for only about dozen weeks, [the new administration handled a
lot of [action]{.mark} on multiple fronts quite deftly. Much of that
[can be credited to]{.mark} the **maturity and [experience of
Trump's]{.mark} senior national-security [team]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
But how the administration responded was purely Trumpian---reflecting an
impulse that transcends the makeup of his foreign team or other White
House advisors. **Decoding Trumpian Strategy** Since the early days of
the campaign, one thing has been clear: trying stitch together an
understanding of Trump's foreign and defense policy based on Trump's
tweets and other off-hand comments is a fool's errand. [That has not
changed](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/dont-fear-trumps-tweets-19398)
since the Donald took over the Oval Office. That is not to say that none
of Trump's rhetoric matters. He has given some serious speeches and
commentary. But pundits err when they give every presidential utterance
equal merit. [A joint address to
Congress](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/trump-will-make-good-his-promise-keep-the-country-free-safe-19634)
ought to carry a lot more weight than a 3 a.m. tweet about the
Terminator. But especially with this presidency, [one needs to **[focus
on]{.mark}** White House [**actions rather than words** to]{.mark} gain
a clearer [understandi]{.mark}ng of [where]{.mark} security and [foreign
policy is headed. Do that, and one sees emerging]{.mark} a foreign and
defense [policy]{.mark} **more conventional and [more
consistent]{.mark}**]{.underline} than what we got from Bush or Obama.
Still, a deeper dive is necessary to get at the root of Trump's take on
the world [and how it fits with recent
actions](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-most-shocking-thing-about-trump-so-far-how-boring-hes-19769)
like the tomahawk strikes in Syria and the armada steaming toward North
Korea. **[[I]{.mark} [briefed]{.mark}]{.underline}** Candidate
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** and his policy advisors
**[[during]{.mark} the [campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I organized
workshops for the ambassadorial corps during the Cleveland Convention
and worked with the presidential team through the inauguration. Those
experiences let me observe how the policies from the future fledgling
administration were unfolding. Here are some observations that might be
helpful in understanding the Trumpian way. **[At the core of Trump's
view of the world are his views on the global liberal
order]{.underline}**. Trump is no isolationist. **[[He
recognizes]{.mark} that [America]{.mark} is a global power with global
interests and that it [can't]{.mark} promote and [protect]{.mark} those
[interests by sitting at home]{.mark} on its hands]{.underline}**.
Freedom of the commons, engaging and cooperating with like-minded
nations, [[working to blunt problems "over there" before they
get]{.mark} over [here]{.mark}---these are things every modern president
has pursued. **Trump is no different.**]{.underline} What distinguishes
Trump---and what marks a particularly sharp departure from Obama---is
his perception of what enabled post--World War America and the rest of
the free world to rise above the chaos of a half century of global
depression and open war. Obama and his ilk chalked it all up to
international infrastructure---the UN, IMF, World Bank, EU, et al. For
Trump, it was the sovereign states rather than the global bureaucracies
that made things better. The international superstructure has to stand
on a firm foundation---and the foundation is the sovereign state.
Without strong, vibrant, free and wealthy states, the whole thing
collapses like a Ponzi scheme. Trump is an arch nationalist in the
positive sense of the term. [America will never be
safe](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-fight-over-nationalism-about-get-messy-19266)
in the world if the world doesn't have an America that is free, safe and
prosperous. That belief is at the heart of Trump's policies designed to
spark an economic revival, rollback the administrative state and rebuild
the military. It lies at the core of his mantra: make America great
again. Even the strongest [America]{.underline}, however, [can't be a
global power without the willingness to act globally. And **[that\'s
where Trump\'s]{.mark} declaration of "[America First" comes
in]{.mark}.** What it means for foreign policy is that the president
will put the vital interests of the United States above the maintenance
of global institutions]{.underline}. That is **[[not an
abandonment]{.mark} of universal values]{.underline}**. Every American
president deals with the challenge of protecting interests and promoting
values. [Trump]{.underline} will focus on American interests and
American values, and that [poses no threat to friends and
allies]{.underline}. In many cases[, we share the same
values.]{.underline} In many cases, what\'s in [America\'s vital
interest is also in their interest---and best achieved through joint
partnership]{.underline}. Here is how those animating ideas are
currently manifesting themselves in Trump\'s strategy: A strategy
includes ends (what you are trying to accomplish), means (the
capabilities you will use to do that) and ways (how you are going to do
it). [The ends of Trump's strategy are **pretty clear**]{.underline}. In
both talk and action in the Trump world, it boils down to three parts of
the world: Europe, Asia and the Middle East. That makes sense. [Peace
and stability in these regions are vital to U.S. interest]{.underline}s
and are under assault. The United States wants all three parts of the
world to settle. It is unrealistic to think all the problems can be made
to disappear, but it is not unrealistic to significantly reduce the
potential for region-wide conflict.

**[[The liberal]{.mark} world [order is under

about upholding the rules-based global system. Populists are besieging
governing elites in the West while Russia works strategically to
destabilize European and American governments through propaganda and
proxies. **[[A rising China wants to create a global system that is not
U.S.-centric]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one **[in which]{.underline}**
**[smaller powers defer to bigger ones]{.underline}** and norms of
democracy and rule of law do not prevail. Meanwhile, the U.S. alliance
system looks adrift while competitors in China and Russia appear to be
on the march. If it holds, [**[this trend could produce a
spheres-of-influence
world]{.underline}** --- **[which]{.underline}**]{.mark} many, including
the current presidents of the United States, **[China]{.underline}**,
**[and Russia]{.underline}**, **[find intuitively
attractive]{.underline}**. But were such an order to replace one based
on global integration and American leadership in the geopolitical
cockpits of Europe and Asia, **[it [would]{.mark} only [engender
insecurity and conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[In]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a [spheres]{.mark}-of-influence
world]{.underline}**, **[[great powers order their
regions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United States would go back to a
"Monroe Doctrine" version of grand strategy; **[[Russia]{.mark} would
dominate]{.underline}** the **[former Soviet space]{.underline}**;
**[[China]{.mark} would govern East Asia]{.underline}**, **[and
[India]{.mark} South Asia]{.underline}**. The problem with this kind of
order, however, is several-fold. Too many [**[spheres
overlap]{.underline}** **[in ways that would generate
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[rather than clean lines of
responsibility]{.underline}**. **[[Japan would oppose Chinese

**[[Russia and China would contest]{.mark} the [resources]{.mark} and
loyalties of Central Asia]{.underline}**; **[[Europe and Russia would

**[[The Middle East would be an]{.mark} even more likely [arena for hot
war between Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [and Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[and Turkey would contest regions]{.underline}** also **[claimed by
Russia]{.underline}**, **[Europe]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
possibly **[China]{.underline}**. **[Russia]{.underline}**, like the
Soviet Empire before it, **[would keep pushing west until it met enough

**[[sharpen great power competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[outside of

challenge the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [S]{.mark}tates
out-of-area if it had subdued strategic competition]{.underline}** in
its own region. **[Russia]{.underline}**, like the Soviet Empire before
it, **[would keep pushing west until it met enough hard power to stop
it]{.underline}**. (The fact that Russian troops marched through Paris
during the Napoleonic Wars demonstrates that the limits of Russian power
need not be confined to the former Warsaw Pact). American leaders have
long understood that a "Fortress America" approach is a source of
national insecurity. Franklin Roosevelt made this case in a series of
"fireside chats" in the run-up to America's participation in World War
II --- even before the advent of the far more sophisticated
power-projection technologies that exist today. Roosevelt and his
generals well understood that the United States could not be safe if
hostile powers controlled Europe and Asia, despite the wide oceans
separating North America from both theaters. [A
**[spheres]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[-of-influence [world
would]{.mark}]{.underline}** also [**[crack up]{.underline}** **[the
integrated]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[global

**[including an East Asia]{.underline}** "co-prosperity sphere,"
**[[seeding conflict]{.mark} and undercutting prosperity]{.underline}**.
A real-world and real-time example of what happens when American power
retreats in an effort to encourage regional powers to solve their own
problems is the mess in Syria. It has produced the greatest refugee
crisis since 1945 --- a stain on the consciousness of human
civilization --- and has led many to conclude that the Middle Eastern
order of states dating to the end of World War 1 is collapsing.
President Obama pursued an express policy of retracting American
military power from the Middle East, including withdrawing all troops
from Iraq and refusing to intervene militarily when President Assad used
chemical weapons against his own people, despite a red-line injunction
from the United States not to do so. Obama and his White House political
advisors believed that American withdrawal from the Arab Middle East (if
not from the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel) would lead a new
balance of power to form, one policed by regional powers rather than by
America. **[This flawed]{.underline}**, amoral, and **[un-strategic
approach has led to a series of hot wars ]{.underline}**--- in
**[Syria]{.underline}**, **[Iraq]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
**[Yemen]{.underline}** --- the **[collapse of Arab allies' confidence
in the United States as an ally]{.underline}**, **[as well
as]{.underline}** an **[intensified cold war with Iran]{.underline}**.
**[Despite the international agreement]{.underline}** freezing Iran's
nuclear program, **[Iran's support for terrorism and hostile
insurgencies targeting American allies across its region actually
intensified during this period]{.underline}**. A
**[[spheres]{.mark}-of-influence]{.underline}** world **[[leaves weaker
states to become the victims of stronger]{.underline}]{.mark}** or more
**[aggressive [ones]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and [**[it seeds insecurity
by]{.underline}** **[removing]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the reassuring
variable of [American military guarantees]{.mark} and
presence]{.underline}** This experience underlines a core problem with a
**[spheres-of-influence]{.underline}** world. It leaves weaker states to
become the victims of stronger or more aggressive ones, and it seeds
insecurity by removing the reassuring variable of American military
guarantees and presence. **[It emboldens American adversaries and leads
American allies to take self-help measures that themselves may undercut
American security interests]{.underline}**. A
**[[spheres]{.mark}-of-influence world]{.underline}** would also
**[[produce contestation of the]{.mark} open [global
commons]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[that are the basis for the
unprecedented prosperity]{.underline}** produced by the liberal
international economic order. **[Should [the]{.mark} Indian and Pacific

conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** (like the South China Sea already has
thanks to China's militarization and unilateral assertion of sovereignty
over it) **[as leading states seek to incorporate them into their

power.]{.underline}** **[[The U]{.mark}nited

power]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and since norms like **[freedom of the

**[underwritten by that power]{.underline}**. More broadly, **[such [a

likely **[[lead to]{.mark} the kind of [hot wars that reorder the
international balance of power]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[including]{.underline}** by **[incentivizing aggressive states to

it]{.underline}**. It would also be ironic if the United States were to
back away from its historic commitment to shaping a world that is an
idealized vision of America itself --- one ruled by laws, norms,
institutions, markets, and peaceful settlement of disputes.

#### Global nuclear war

Ultimately, however, we concluded that **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[has
a strong interest in precluding]{.mark} the emergence of [another
bipolar world]{.mark}]{.underline}**---as in the Cold
War---**[[or]{.mark} a world of [many]{.mark} great
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as existed before the two world wars.
**[[Multipolarity led to]{.mark} two [world wars]{.mark} and [bipolarity
resulted in]{.mark} a]{.underline}** protracted **[worldwide struggle
with the [risk of nuclear annihilation. To avoid a return]{.mark} such
circumstances]{.underline}**, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney
ultimately agreed that **[[our objective must be to prevent a hostile
power to dominate a "critical region]{.mark}," which
would]{.underline}** give it the resources, industrial capabilities and
population to **[pose a global challenge]{.underline}**. This insight
has guided U.S. defense policy throughout the post--Cold War era.

**[[Giving major powers the green light]{.mark} to establish spheres of
influence [would produce a multipolar world and
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}** the return of **[[war between]{.mark} the
[major powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Without a stabilizing U.S.
presence in the Persian Gulf and U.S. relationships with Jordan and the
Gulf States, Iran could shut down oil shipments in its supposed sphere
of influence. A similar scenario in fact played out during the 1987
"tanker war" of the Iran-Iraq war, which eventually escalated into a
direct military conflict between the United States and Iran. Iran's
nuclear program makes these scenarios even more dangerous.

**[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[can manage the rise]{.mark} and resurgence [of great powers like
China, Russia and Iran]{.mark} at an acceptable cost [without
ceding]{.mark} entire [spheres of influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
key is to focus on normalizing the geopolitics of the Middle East,
Europe and the Asia-Pacific, which the United States can do by
strengthening its transatlantic and transpacific alliances and adapting
them to the new, dangerous circumstances on the horizon. **[The
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should promote a
balance of power in key regions while seeking opportunities to reconcile
differences among major actors]{.underline}**.

### Polarization\-\--A2: No Heg Impact\-\--Fettweis

#### Fettweis is wrong

**Fempa 11** -- Francis P. Sempa, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania, Adjunct Professor of Political Science at
Wilkes University, and Contributing Editor to American Diplomacy,
October, Review of Dangerous Times? The International Politics of Great
Power Peace By Christopher J. Fettweis, Joint Force Quarterly, Issue 63,
p. 150

Forget Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and Machiavelli. Put aside Mackinder, Mahan,
and Spykman. Close the military academies and war colleges. Shut our
overseas bases. **[Bring our troops home. Make dramatic cuts in the
defense budget. The end of major war]{.underline}**, and perhaps the end
of war itself, **[is near, according to]{.underline}** Tulane assistant
professor Christopher **[Fettweis]{.underline}** in his recent book,
Dangerous Times? The International Politics of Great Power Peace.

Fettweis is not the first intellectual, nor will he be the last, to
proclaim the onset of perpetual peace. He is squarely in the tradition
of Immanuel Kant, Herbert Spencer, and Norman Angell, to name just
three. Indeed, in the book's introduction, Fettweis attempts to
rehabilitate Angell's reputation for prophecy, which suffered a
devastating blow when the Great War falsified his claim in The Great
Illusion that economic interdependence had rendered great power war
obsolete. Angell, Fettweis writes, was the first "prominent
constructivist thinker of the twentieth century," and was not
wrong---just ahead of his time (p. 5).

Fettweis bases his theory or vision of the obsolescence of major war on
the supposed linear progress of human nature, a major tenet of
20th-century liberalism that is rooted in the rationalist theories of
the Enlightenment. "History," according to Fettweis, "seems to be
unfolding as a line extending into the future---a halting, incomplete,
inconsistent line perhaps, one with frequent temporary reversals, but a
line nonetheless." The world is growing "more liberal and more reliant
upon reason, logic, and science" (p. 217).

**[We have heard this all before]{.underline}**. Human nature can be
perfected. Statesmen and **[leaders will be guided by
reason]{.underline}** and science. Such thinking influenced the
visionaries of the French Revolution and produced 25 years of war among
the great powers of Europe. Similar ideas influenced President Woodrow
Wilson and his intellectual supporters who endeavored at Versailles to
transform the horrors of World War I into a peace that would make that
conflict "the war to end all wars." What followed were disarmament
conferences, an international agreement to outlaw war, the rise of
expansionist powers, appeasement by the democracies, and the most
destructive war in human history. **[Ideas, which Fettweis claims will
bring about the proliferation of peace]{.underline}**, **[transformed
Russia, Germany, and Japan into expansionist, totalitarian
powers]{.underline}**. Those same ideas led to the Gulag, the Holocaust,
and the Rape of Nanking. So much for human progress.

**[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark}** knows all of this, but
**[[claims]{.mark} that since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}**,
the leaders and peoples of **[the [major powers]{.mark}, except the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[[have
accepted]{.mark} the idea [that major war is
unthinkable]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[His proof
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[that there has been [no major war
among]{.mark} the great powers [for 20
years]{.mark}]{.underline}**[---**[a]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[historical [period that coincides with the American "unipolar"
moment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This is very thin empirical evidence
upon which to base a predictive theory of international
relations.]{.underline}**

Fettweis criticizes the realist and neorealist schools of thought,
claiming that their adherents focus too narrowly on the past behavior of
states in the international system. In his view, realists place too
great an emphasis on power. Ideas and norms instead of power, he claims,
provide structure to the international system. Classical geopolitical
theorists such as Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Nicholas
Spykman, and Colin Gray are dismissed by Fettweis in less than two
pages, despite the fact that their analyses of great power politics and
conflict have long been considered sound and frequently prescient.

**[[Realists]{.mark} and classical geopoliticians
[have]{.mark}]{.underline}** more than **[[2,000 years of]{.mark}
empirical [evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to support their theories
of how states and empires behave and how the international system
works]{.underline}**. [**[Ideas are important, but]{.underline}**
**[power is the governing force]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in
international politics]{.underline}**, and geography is the most
permanent factor in the analysis of power.

**[Fettweis makes much of the fact that]{.underline}** the countries of
Western and Central **[Europe]{.underline}**, which waged war against
each other repeatedly for nearly 400 years, **[are at
peace]{.underline}**, and claims that there is little likelihood that
they will ever again wage war against each other. Even if the latter
assertion turns out to be true, **[that does not mean that the end of
major war is in sight]{.underline}**. Throughout history, some peoples
and empires that previously waged war for one reason or another became
pacific without producing worldwide perpetual peace: the Mongols,
Saracens, Ottomans, Dutch, Venetians, and the Spanish Empire come
immediately to mind. A Europe at peace does not translate to an Asia,
Africa, and Middle East at peace.

In a world in which major wars are obsolete, **[[Fettweis believes the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates

strategy]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[from vigorous internationalism
[to]{.mark} strategic [restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}**. His specific
recommendations include the removal of all U.S. military forces from
Europe; an end to our bilateral security guarantees to Japan and South
Korea; an end to our alliance with Israel; an indifference to the
balance of power on the Eurasian landmass; a law enforcement approach to
terrorism; a drastic cut in military spending; a much smaller Navy; and
the abolition of regional combatant commands.

What **[Fettweis is proposing]{.underline}** is effectively **[an end
to]{.underline}** what Walter Russell Mead calls "**[[the maritime world
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**" that was established by Great Britain and
maintained first by the British Empire and then by the United States.
**[It is a world order that [has]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[defeated]{.mark} repeated [challenges by potential hegemonic
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and resulted in an unprecedented spread
of prosperity and freedom]{.underline}**. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Fettweis needs]{.mark} a dose of [humility]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Sir Halford Mackinder, the greatest of all geopoliticians, was referring
to visionaries and liberal idealists like Fettweis when he cautioned,
"He would be a sanguine man . . . who would trust the future peace of
the world to a change in the mentality of any nation." Most profoundly,
General Douglas MacArthur, who knew a little bit more about war and
international conflict than Fettweis, reminded the cadets at West Point
in 1962 that "only the dead have seen the end of war."

#### It has no empirical backing

Fettweis is clear that he is writing to change (or begin to change) the
national conversation in the United States regarding foreign policy.
Thus, [Fettweis\'s target audience is]{.underline} policymakers and [the
general public. This]{.underline} fact [can make the book
frustrating]{.underline} reading for scholars. For example, [[Fettweis
**does not**]{.underline}]{.mark} always [**[back]{.mark} his [claims
with evidence]{.mark}** or citations. More problematic]{.underline},
however, [is Fettweis\'s call for]{.underline} a rational basis for
[policymaking based on]{.underline} the American [national interest.
What does that mean?]{.underline} Scott [Burchill goes so far as to call
the]{.underline} concept of the [national interest devoid of
**substantive content**]{.underline}.\[5\] Thus, [the
concept]{.underline} of the national interest, to say the least, [is
**rarely clear**]{.underline}---and [that means]{.underline} that [the
rational pursuit]{.underline} of the national interest [is at
best]{.underline} a [very difficult]{.underline} endeavor. Moreover,
[there are multiple modes of rationality. A policymaker
who]{.underline}, like most modern presidents, [obsessively monitors
polling]{.underline} as a basis of policymaking [is being
rational]{.underline} \-- [even if it is]{.underline} a
[different]{.underline} rationality than that which Fettweis calls for.
[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, largely [**leaves aside**
these issues. He never]{.underline} explicitly [explores the
sources]{.underline} or foundations [of rationality other
than]{.underline} to invoke [classical realism. He **[does not
address]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[substantial **scholarly
literature** wrestling with]{.underline}]{.mark} the concept of [[a
national interest]{.underline}]{.mark}. Going further, the growing
literature on securitization theory problematizes the idea that threats
are objective conditions that can be clearly identified by savvy or wise
policymakers.\[6\] [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn
[[undermines]{.underline}]{.mark} the objectivist ontology that
underlies [[Fettweis\'s thesis]{.underline}]{.mark}. If it is the case
that threats are intersubjective constructions rather than objective
conditions, Fettweis\' argument is robbed of its prescriptive force. To
be sure, Fettweis\'s critique of the flaws in U.S. foreign policy
remains trenchant. But [[the call]{.mark} to rational
assessment]{.underline} of objective foreign threats
[[becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[hollow]{.underline}]{.mark}** one.
In part [these issues arise because of the 'bridging the gap' agenda
within]{.underline} which Fettweis situates [the book]{.underline}. As
the existence of programs like American University\'s International
Policy Summer Institute and the resurgent debate over the
policy-academia gulf attest,\[7\] efforts like Fettweis\'s are both
badly needed and very welcome. But if bridging the gap were easy, there
would be little need to encourage scholars and policymakers to do it.
Fettweis\'s effort demonstrates just how difficult it can be to satisfy
both sides. [[Academics will be frustrated by Fettweis\'s refusal to
engage in]{.underline}]{.mark} explicit theory building or [[empirical
**verification**]{.mark}. Policymakers will]{.underline} no doubt [be
frustrated by Fettweis\'s **amorphous**]{.underline} policy
[**guidance** to be rational]{.underline} and focus on the national
interest.

#### Fettweis makes terrible assumptions

**Beede 11 --** Benjamin R. Beede, Rutgers, The State University of New
JerseyFettweis, Christopher J. 2008. Losing Hurts Twice as Bad: The Four
States to Moving Beyond Iraq. New York, NY

Fettweis' book might easily be dismissed as an intriguing analysis, but
one that has been superseded by the advent of the Obama Administration,
and the changes in direction that the Obama team has advocated and that
it may implement. **[[Fettweis made a number of assumptions]{.mark} that
[have]{.mark} now [been invalidated]{.mark}]{.underline}**, moreover,
including a continuation of prosperity. Despite its flaws, however, the
book is a provocative contribution to the literature that criticizes the
forcefulness of the U.S. foreign and military policy. Fettweis states
that his objective is to analyze the "likely consequences of disaster in
Iraq" (16), but he really has two purposes. One is to explain to people
in the United States how they can adjust to the loss of the Iraq war.
The second is to persuade readers that the United States can safely
reduce its activity in international affairs. Although the author's
discussion of Iraq must be addressed, this review emphasizes Fettweis'
contention that the United States can safely be less assertive in world
affairs because the world is not as dangerous a place as often claimed,
and his closely related point that the public needs to develop a more
discriminating approach to assessing threats from abroad, thereby
enabling it to hold its government to higher levels of competency and
accountability. Fettweis' book title comes from a remark by sports
figure Sparky Anderson that "losing hurts twice as bad as winning feels
good" (13). He believes that this observation is valid, and he comes
back to those words repeatedly. To support his contention concerning the
significance of Anderson's statement, Fettweis borrows from the
literature of psychology to explain how people experience losses,
ranging from having relatives or friends taken from them by death to
having their favorite sports teams lose games. In competitive
situations, the harmful psychological effects of losing are said to be
intensified significantly when one adversary or opponent was "supposed"
to win because of its strength. The number of instances where large
countries have lost to guerrilla movements demonstrates that perceptions
of the military advantages that the seemingly stronger side enjoys may
well be outweighed by other factors, however (see Arreguin-Toft 2005;
Record 2007). **[Fettweis recommends a rapid withdrawal]{.underline}**
of the U.S. forces from Iraq. He believes that the Iraq war has "been
the worst kind of defeat for the United States: an unnecessary one, in a
war that should never have been fought" (16, emphasis in the original).
Not only was the war a huge error, Iraq is in such bad OCTOBER BOOK
REVIEWS \| 865 shape that the United States cannot do much to assist its
reconstruction. A long-term occupation might eliminate many problems in
Iraq, but he doubts the United States will stay long enough to affect
major changes in that country. Little harm will come from the
withdrawal, despite predictions by many that there would be civil war in
Iraq and a security breakdown in the entire region. Fettweis is not a
specialist in Middle Eastern affairs, and his interest is in the effects
the Iraq war is having and will have on the United States, not so much
in the Iraq situation. Thus, his book is not comparable to studies like
that by O'Leary (2009). **[[There are at least two schools of
thought]{.mark} about]{.underline}** the **[Iraq]{.underline}** war,
**[[but Fettweis ignores this division]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
opinion. One school, which includes Fettweis, criticizes the Bush
Administration for having rashly invaded Iraq and for having failed to
plan and execute the operation properly. Fettweis writes that "\[w\]e
were led into the Iraq morass not by evil people lying on behalf of oil
companies but by poor strategists with a shallow, naive understanding of
international politics" (29). Another school of interpretation views the
Iraq (and Afghanistan) commitments simply as steps in a campaign
undertaken to give the United States a lasting hegemony in the world.
From the Bush Administration's perspective, Iraq might even be
considered a success. The executive branch demonstrated once again that
it can wage war with few checks on its actions, and gave the United
States a greater presence in the Middle East. The
**[Obama]{.underline}** Administration **[has altered Bush's
course]{.underline}** to some extent, but so far, there has not been a
radical shift. Indeed, there has been and remains the possibility of a
greater commitment in the region, especially into Pakistan. Iraq and the
United States have agreed to the removal of coalition forces by 2011,
but the continued violence in Iraq and the construction of substantial
military bases suggest that a U.S. military presence might continue past
2011. In February 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates reiterated the Obama
Administration's commitment to 2011, but in late May 2009, the army
chief of staff, George Casey, declared that his service branch, at
least, is planning for U.S. forces to remain in Iraq for another decade.
In any event, there is little prospect for a full disengagement from
southwest Asia any time soon. Given one of the purposes of his book, it
is hardly surprising that Fettweis focuses almost entirely on Iraq. He
ignores Afghanistan, except for repeatedly citing the Soviet persistence
in trying to hold that country as an example of a great power making the
error of invading a small country in the face of deep nationalism in the
latter. He might have been well advised to view the entire area of
southwestern Asia. Ahmed Rashid (2008) has described the U.S.
involvement in the region that has extended well beyond Iraq and
Afghanistan, and that suffers from the same kinds of misjudgments made
in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially an overreliance on military measures
and a reluctance to commit substantial resources to economic
development. **[Fettweis uses Iraq to argue for a]{.underline}**
strategy of **[restraint]{.underline}** based on his sanguine view that
"we \[the United States and, indeed, the entire world\] are living in a
golden age" (31, emphasis in the original), and that "\[g\]reat power
conflict today is all but unthinkable; therefore, calculations
surrounding the dangers posed by a united Eurasia should change, since
the threats it once posed no longer exist" (208). With the end of the
Cold War, the ability of the enemies of the United States to harm this
country is quite limited. Hostile acts can be perpetrated, but such
attacks cannot overthrow the United States (31). This strategy is hardly
new. Years ago, it was summarized in these words, "Instead of preserving
obsolete Cold War alliances and embarking on an expensive and dangerous
campaign for global stability, the United States should view the
collapse of Soviet power as an opportunity to adopt a less
interventionist policy" (Carpenter 1992, 167). **[[Despite the
optimistic picture painted]{.mark} by some national security theorists,
[the world does contain]{.mark} some [dangerous
elements]{.mark}]{.underline}**. David E.
**[[Sanger]{.underline}]{.mark}** (2009), for example, **[[presents a
chilling picture of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s in]{.mark} very possibly
[unsteady]{.mark} [hands]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Much is said in the
book concerning national "credibility," that is, the ability of a
country to maintain its prestige and its reputation for decisive action
based on its past performance. Fettweis argues that many governmental
leaders, academic commentators, and journalists have been obsessed with
this element of national power and have wanted the United States to deal
with virtually any political crisis that occurs (161-75). **[[Fettweis
states that]{.mark} "\[f\]or some reason, U.S. [policymakers seem to
be]{.mark} especially [prone to overestimate]{.mark} the
[threats]{.mark} they face"]{.underline}** (116). **[[There is no
explanation]{.mark} of [why this should be the case]{.mark}, nor is
there any comparison with the propensity of leaders in other countries
to make similar inaccurate projections.]{.underline}** Numerous
instances can be cited where governmental leaders and commentators have
argued heatedly for "action" on the ground that "inaction" will damage
the reputation of the United States. Early in the Carter Administration,
for example, National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski dedicated
himself for some time to instigating the dispatch of navy task force to
the Horn of Africa during a period of tension between Ethiopia and
Somalia. After failing to persuade the secretaries of state and defense
that such action was necessary, Brzezinski waged a covert effort through
the media to bring a decision in favor of his policy (Gardner 2008,
40-2). Two case histories cited in the book as examples of a disastrous
insistence on maintaining credibility are the Spanish and British
efforts to hold the Netherlands and the British colonies that became the
United States, respectively. More recent instances that could have been
cited are the controversies in the United States concerning the "loss"
of China in the late 1940s and the establishment of a communist regime
in Cuba in the late 1950s. Sensitivity concerning Cuba led in part to
the intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965, and other episodes
where the United States committed itself to fighting insurgencies in
Latin America. OCTOBER BOOK REVIEWS \| 867 Concerns about the political
impact of the "loss" of Vietnam played a significant role in decisions
to support the Republic of Vietnam. These episodes are largely omitted,
though. Fear is a potent political weapon, and foreign threats, whether
real or imaginary, are highly useful within the domestic political
arena. Claims of a "missile gap" helped John F. Kennedy win the
presidency, for example. The armed services and the various intelligence
agencies are rewarded because of fears of foreign threats. Although the
armed forces may be cautious about entering a given conflict or making
other violent moves, they are unlikely to stress the peaceful nature of
the world if they want to retain their budgets and their prestige.
Another element in strategy formulation in the United States has been
its experience with long-term threats. White (1997) asserts that the
long conflict with the Soviet Union fundamentally structured the
discussion and resolution of public policy issues in the United States,
and greatly strengthened the presidency at the expense of Congress and
the political parties. Although his book was written before 9/11, his
observation that political activists and the public have become
accustomed to protracted battles with foreign enemies makes it easy to
understand why they could readily accept a "long war" against terrorism.
Somewhat along the same line, Sherry (1995) maintains that this country
has been under emergency conditions from the Great Depression onward,
perhaps even before, permeating the United States with "militarism" in
its broadest sense. Going back even further, some writers have argued
that United States' assertiveness may be traced to the late nineteenth
and especially the early twentieth century. Lears (2009) points
critically to Theodore Roosevelt as a key player in this development,
and Ninkovich (1999) offers a more favorable view of the "crisis
internationalism" of Woodrow Wilson. **[[Fettweis]{.underline}]{.mark}**
touches on this history, but he **[[underestimates the extent to
which]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been conditioned
to react vigorously]{.mark} to a range of foreign policy issues, and
overestimates the differences in foreign and military policy brought
about by changes from one administration to another]{.underline}**.
Given this conditioning, changing the mind-sets of both elites and the
public may be an extremely difficult task. **[To a degree, Fettweis'
arguments resemble those of the "American empire"
theorists]{.underline}**, such as Bacevich (2008), Johnson (2006), and
Gardner and Young (2005). **[Critics of the "American empire" believe
that the United States produces much of the unrest]{.underline}** and
the tension in the world through its unilateral actions and its emphasis
on military power. Fettweis does not go that far, but **[his advocacy of
"strategic restraint" is certainly compatible with such
views.]{.underline}** He agrees that the United States'
involvements---especially military commitments---abroad may unsettle
conditions in countries as much as they may stabilize them, but his
purpose is primarily to reassure the people of the United States that
less assertive activity by their country will not result in world chaos.
Thus he does not have much to say about the motivations of elite figures
868 \| POLITICS & POLICY / October 2011 who advocate an active foreign
policy. His argument seems to be that the United States is vastly
overextended in its commitments as a result of a number of individual
mistakes stemming from an overconcern with credibility rather than a
flawed strategy. Despite his disclaimers, **[Fettweis' words sometimes
resemble the arguments of pre-World War II isolationists]{.underline}**.
Indeed, throughout the book, the word "internationalists," which
properly describes those concerned with international cooperation, is
used to refer to those who should be termed "interventionists," whether
their motivations are power political, economic, or humanitarian, or a
mixture of the three. **[Fettweis believes that there was little that
the United States could have done to prevent the outbreak of World War
II in Europe,]{.underline}** moreover. **[On the contrary, firmer U.S.
support of France and Great Britain might have encouraged those
countries to force Germany to evacuate the newly reoccupied Rhineland
and to render it much more cautious in its later actions.]{.underline}**
After he successfully implemented his plan to put troops into the
Rhineland in 1936, Hitler told his confidants that a French demand for a
withdrawal would have been successful owing to Germany's military
weakness. **[Fettweis even praises the United States because it "had the
wisdom to remain neutral for more than two years]{.underline}**" and
thus "escaped the worst of the suffering" (206). **[This is surely
wrong.]{.underline}** **[An earlier involvement in the war would
doubtless have reduced U.S. casualties]{.underline}** and other costs
because invasions of Europe would have been unnecessary if the French
and British had held at least part of the continent, and because Germany
might not have developed a cushion of occupied territories to protect it
from land attacks and from air assaults for a time. Whether a public
educated by books like this one would be able to make suitable threat
assessments, and thereby be better able to exercise control over
governmental actions abroad is another question. **[Fettweis' work may
be quite persuasive because he expresses his views clearly and avoids
highly charged language.]{.underline}** However, if elites agree about
dangers from abroad, then popular opinion may have little effect on
policy making and policy implementation. [**[Fettweis' thinking is
significantly flawed]{.underline}** **[by his assumption that "politics
is]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[and always will be, [the enemy of]{.mark}
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,"]{.mark} and reiterates his point
(26, 157). Fettweis adds that "it would be naive to suggest that it is
possible to keep politics completely separate from strategy, nor would
it be fully desirable to do so in a democracy" (26-7), but "for the sake
of this book, we will attempt to clarify the national interest by
keeping the two realms separate, to the extent possible" (27).
Determining national strategy is necessarily a highly political act, and
it cannot be established without considering the demands of major
internal stakeholders. What he terms "politics" may often be differing
opinions based on different data or interpretations of the same data.
Political survival is critical for a political leader, and such leaders
can understandably be hesitant in exercising restraint if they believe
their opponents will attack them, perhaps decisively, for being "soft"
on the enemies of the day. Fettweis is fond of the term "realist" to
OCTOBER BOOK REVIEWS \| 869 refer to some defense and foreign policy
analysts, but describing someone as a "realist" may simply mean that the
person agrees with the views of the individual applying that
description. In certain instances, "realism" can mean being restrained,
and, in other instances, being highly assertive. **[Appropriate policy
decisions are likely to be made on the basis of accurate intelligence
and careful assessments rather than adherence to a general
outlook.]{.underline}**

### Polarization\-\--A2: Not Key to Heg

#### Gridlock kills heg -- leadership and credibility collapse 

**Haass 15 --** Richard, president of the Council on Foreign Relations,
9/2/15, "The Biggest Threat to the U.S. Are Internal Divisions,"
<http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/09/02/whats-the-greatest-threat-to-us-national-security/the-biggest-threat-to-the-us-are-internal-divisions-11>

**[There are many candidates for]{.underline}** what constitutes **[[the
principal]{.mark} national [security threat]{.mark} to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Even an abbreviated list
would include the Islamic State and terrorism more broadly, a more
assertive China, a revisionist Russia, Iran, North Korea, climate change
and an Ebola-like pandemic.

All these threats should be taken seriously. My choice, though, for
**[what threatens America most [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** very
different: **[our [internal]{.mark} political
[divisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The divisions are **[[between the
White House]{.mark} and [Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}** but also
**[[within the parties]{.mark} and between citizens and]{.underline}**
their **[government]{.underline}**. One result is that **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[does
not have]{.mark} the [resources]{.mark} it needs [for]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- and **[what resources it does make
available are]{.underline}** often **[spent to satisfy political rather
than strategic needs]{.underline}**.

United States **[infrastructure is woefully inadequate, [leaving
us]{.mark}]{.underline}** less resilient in the face of natural and
artificial disasters and **[[less competitive in]{.mark} the face of
[global competition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Also making this country
less competitive is an outmoded immigration policy that does not do
enough to allow the most talented people to stay here --- and a K-12
education that does not do enough to prepare citizens for the world they
are to enter. Meanwhile, **[[nothing is being done to rein in
entitlement costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** that will soon cause the debt
to skyrocket. Standing in the way of needed reform in all these areas
are political disagreements.

**[[The result is]{.mark} a country weaker than it should be, [failing
to set an example others]{.mark} want to
[emulate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The same **[[divisions make us less
reliable, leading friends to take matters into their]{.mark} own [hands
and foes to challenge us]{.mark} in the belief they have little to fear.
[Add]{.mark}]{.underline}** to this a **[[lack of consensus over]{.mark}
U.S. [priorities around the globe]{.mark} and you end up with a far more
disorderly world because [the most powerful country is unable to
provide]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that no other country can.

international relations?,"
<http://www.cfr.org/united-states/effect-us-domestic-political-gridlock-international-relations/p30725>

There is a well-known adage that politics stops at the water\'s edge,
but this tends to be more hope than reality. **[American history is
filled with examples in which [political disagreement at home has made
it difficult for the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[to act, much less lead,
abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[Division within Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** or between the
legislative and executive branches **[can make it impossible for
individuals to be placed in senior positions]{.underline}**. Such
**[divisions [can]{.mark} also [make it impossible to conclude treaties,
appropriate funds]{.mark} for foreign assistance, [or pass]{.mark}
specific [reforms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as the current proposed
reform for immigration policy. A **[[lack of
consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[can undermine investment in
the foundations of]{.mark} American [power, from resources for defense
and diplomacy to]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[education and
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Gridlock]{.mark} at home [can]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[work
against the ability]{.mark} of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[[to set an example]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that other societies will want to emulate. And **[[it makes the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[less
predictable]{.mark}, something [that can unnerve
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** and others who depend on this country,
**[[and embolden adversaries]{.mark}. All this tends to contribute to
global disorder]{.underline}**---one reason I titled my new book Foreign

In the weeks preceding the midterm elections, a period in which news
coverage of a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the movement of

to U.S. national security.

Independents, making it nearly unique among the threats assessed in the
survey.]{.mark} On the danger partisanship poses to the United States,
at least, there is a bipartisan consensus.]{.underline}**

**[Yet there is a great deal of daylight between Republicans and
Democrats on other possible threats. For example, Republican opinion
leaders are much more likely than Democratic or Independent leaders to
consider Iran's nuclear program and the rise of China a critical threat.
Democrats are much more likely to view Russian influence in US elections
and the decline of democracy around the world as critical
threats.]{.underline}**

While several GOP political ads played up the dangers of immigrants
crossing US borders, relatively few among even GOP experts consider
immigration a critical threat.

North Korea's nuclear program is the only threat other than partisanship
to earn notable levels of concern across political affiliation.

**[[The]{.mark} leadership [survey was conducted between August 2 and
October 16, 2018 among 588 foreign policy opinion leaders from executive
branch agencies, Congress, think tanks, academia, the media, interest
groups, business leaders, religious groups, and
NGOs.]{.mark}]{.underline}** These particular groupings of opinion
leaders were weighted to match the weights applied to previous Chicago
Council opinion leader surveys going back to 1974.

**[[Some of President Trump's bold foreign policy actions, such as
withdrawing the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change
and the Iranian nuclear deal, also elicit polarized reactions across
party lines.]{.mark} Nearly all Democratic opinion leaders support U.S.
participation in both agreements (99 percent for the Paris agreement,
100 percent for the Iran deal) as do a majority of Independent leaders
(86 percent Paris agreement, 74 percent Iran deal).]{.underline}** By
contrast, only minorities of Republican opinion leaders favor these
accords (36 percent for the Paris agreement, 46 percent for the Iran
deal). That said, John Bolton, Trump's fiercely unilateralist national
security advisor, might recoil at the finding that more than a third of
Republican foreign policy elites support U.S. participation in these
agreements.

**[While [political polarization is a top threat for leaders]{.mark}, it
is a lesser, but still substantial, concern for the American
public.]{.underline}** A July 12-31, 2018 Chicago Council on Global
Affairs survey of the US public found that 50 percent of Americans
consider political polarization a critical threat, behind only
international terrorism (66 percent), and North Korean (59 percent) and
Iranian (52 percent) nuclear programs.

**[Americans' concern about polarization is more acute among
self-identified Democrats (57 percent) and Independents (50 percent)
than Republicans (41 percent).]{.underline}**

**[[The comparatively greater sense of alarm among foreign policy
leaders versus the public about the threat presented by polarization may
reflect leaders']{.mark} greater awareness of how polarization is
eroding America's international standing and weakening its ability to
address various global challenges.]{.underline}**

paid, however, to the impact that hyperpolarization could have on U.S.
foreign policy. Apart from an excellent essay by Ken Schultz of Stanford
University, this topic just hasn't received a lot of attention. But it
should.

### Prez Powers\-\--A2: Congress Fails

While the president and other executive agencies took action,
Republicans were left spluttering over Obama\'s power grabs. **[It is
easy to criticize the president for overreach]{.underline}**, but that
would fail to account for the more fundamental problem: **[[Congress has
not been the dominent branch for decades. The executive surpassed it
long ago.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[The executive branch\'s growth in]{.mark} size and [influence means
more]{.mark} concentrated [power and less]{.mark} democratic
[accountability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Each new exercise of executive
power creates precedent to justify its future use. Today, **[[the

the]{.mark} people\'s [representatives]{.mark}, and sometimes
[to]{.mark} spectacularly [bad effect.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Congress has been complicit in its own diminution, but **[[any path to

branch]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The most democratic of the three
branches, only **[[Congress has sufficient constitutional power to bring

Accessed 07-12-2019)

**[[Presidents can]{.mark} also [rely on a cornucopia of powers provided
by Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which has historically been the
principal source of emergency authority for the executive branch.
Throughout the late 18th and 19th centuries, **[[Congress passed laws to
give the president]{.mark} additional [leeway during military, economic,
and labor crises]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A more formalized approach
evolved in the early 20th century, when Congress legislated powers that
would lie dormant until the president activated them by declaring a
national emergency**[. [These statutory authorities began to pile
up]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and because presidents had little incentive
to terminate states of emergency once declared, these piled up too.
**[[By the]{.mark} 19[70s, hundreds of statutory]{.mark} emergency
[powers]{.mark}, and four clearly obsolete states of emergency, [were in
effect.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For instance, the national emergency that
Truman declared in 1950, during the Korean War, remained in place and
was being used to help prosecute the war in Vietnam.

**[[Aiming to rein in this]{.mark} proliferation[, Congress passed the
N]{.mark}ational [E]{.mark}mergencies [A]{.mark}ct in
1976.]{.underline}** Under this law, the president still has complete
discretion to issue an emergency declaration---but he must specify in
the declaration which powers he intends to use, issue public updates if
he decides to invoke additional powers, and report to Congress on the
government's emergency-related expenditures every six months. The state
of emergency expires after a year unless the president renews it, and
the Senate and the House must meet every six months while the emergency
is in effect "to consider a vote" on termination.

**[[By any]{.mark} objective [measure, the law]{.mark} has
[failed]{.mark}. [Thirty states of emergency are in effect
today]{.mark}---several times more than when the act was passed. Most
have been renewed for years on end.]{.underline}** And during the 40
years the law has been in place, Congress has not met even once, let
alone every six months, to vote on whether to end them.

As a result, **[[the president has access to emergency powers contained
in 123]{.mark} statutory [provisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as recently
calculated by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, where
I work. **[These laws address a broad range of matters, from military
composition to agricultural exports to public contracts.]{.underline}**
For the most part, the president is free to use any of them; the
National Emergencies Act doesn't require that the powers invoked relate
to the nature of the emergency. Even if the crisis at hand is, say, a
nationwide crop blight, the president may activate the law that allows
the secretary of transportation to requisition any privately owned
vessel at sea. Many other laws permit the executive branch to take
extraordinary action under specified conditions, such as war and
domestic upheaval, regardless of whether a national emergency has been
declared.

### Prez Powers\-\--A2: No Escalation

#### High tempo interventions [draw in]{.underline} outside powers

**Friedman 11** -- George Friedman, President of Stratfor Global
Forecasting, "What Happened to the American Declaration of War?",
Stratfor, 3-29,
http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110328-what-happened-american-declaration-war

An Increasing Tempo of Operations

All of this came just before **[the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[emerged as the]{.mark} world\'s
single [global power]{.mark}]{.underline}** \-- a global empire \-- that
by definition **[would be [waging war at an increased tempo, from
Kuwait, to Haiti]{.mark}, to [Kosovo]{.mark}, to [Afghanistan]{.mark},
to [Iraq]{.mark}, and so on [in]{.mark} an [ever-increasing]{.mark}
number of [operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And now in Libya, we have
reached the point that even resolutions are no longer needed.

It is said that **[there is no precedent for fighting al
Qaeda]{.underline}**, for example, because it is not a nation but a
subnational group. Therefore, Bush could not reasonably have been
expected to ask for a declaration of war. But there is precedent: Thomas
Jefferson asked for and received a declaration of war against the
Barbary pirates. This authorized Jefferson to wage war against a
subnational group of pirates as if they were a nation.

**[Had Bush requested a declaration of war on al Qaeda]{.underline}** on
Sept. 12, 2001, I suspect **[it would have been granted overwhelmingly,
and the public would have understood that the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[was now at war for as long as the president
thought wise]{.underline}**. The president would have been free to carry
out operations as he saw fit. Roosevelt did not have to ask for special
permission to invade Guadalcanal, send troops to India, or invade North
Africa. In the course of fighting Japan, Germany and Italy, it was
understood that he was free to wage war as he thought fit. In the same
sense, a declaration of war on Sept. 12 would have freed him to fight al
Qaeda wherever they were or to move to block them wherever the president
saw fit.

Leaving aside the military wisdom of Afghanistan or Iraq, **[the legal
and moral foundations would have been clear]{.underline}** \-- so long
as the president as commander in chief saw an action as needed to defeat
al Qaeda, it could be taken. Similarly, as commander in chief, Roosevelt
usurped constitutional rights for citizens in many ways, from censorship
to internment camps for Japanese-Americans. Prisoners of war not
adhering to the Geneva Conventions were shot by military tribunal \-- or
without. In a state of war, different laws and expectations exist than
during peace. Many of the arguments against Bush-era intrusions on
privacy also could have been made against Roosevelt. But Roosevelt had a
declaration of war and full authority as commander in chief during war.
Bush did not. He worked in twilight between war and peace.

One of the dilemmas that could have been avoided was the massive
confusion of whether the United States was engaged in hunting down a
criminal conspiracy or waging war on a foreign enemy. If the former,
then the goal is to punish the guilty. If the latter, then the goal is
to destroy the enemy. Imagine that after Pearl Harbor, FDR had promised
to hunt down every pilot who attacked Pearl Harbor and bring them to
justice, rather than calling for a declaration of war against a hostile
nation and all who bore arms on its behalf regardless of what they had
done. The goal in war is to prevent the other side from acting, not to
punish the actors.

The Importance of the Declaration

A declaration of war, I am arguing, is an essential aspect of war
fighting particularly for the republic when engaged in frequent wars. It
achieves a number of things. First, it holds both Congress and the
president equally responsible for the decision, and does so
unambiguously. Second, it affirms to the people that their lives have
now changed and that they will be bearing burdens. Third, it gives the
president the political and moral authority he needs to wage war on
their behalf and forces everyone to share in the moral responsibility of
war. And finally, by submitting it to a political process, many wars
might be avoided. When we look at some of our wars after World War II it
is not clear they had to be fought in the national interest, nor is it
clear that the presidents would not have been better remembered if they
had been restrained. A declaration of war both frees and restrains the
president, as it was meant to do.

I began by talking about the American empire. I won\'t make the argument
on that here, but simply assert it. What is most important is that the
republic not be overwhelmed in the course of pursuing imperial goals.
The declaration of war is precisely the point at which imperial
interests can overwhelm republican prerogatives.

There are enormous complexities here. **[[Nuclear war has not been
abolished]{.mark}. The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[has treaty obligations to]{.mark}
the U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations **[and [other
countries]{.mark}. Covert operations are essential, as is military
assistance, both of which can lead to war]{.underline}**. I am not
making the argument that constant accommodation to reality does not have
to be made. I am making the argument that the **[suspension of Section
8]{.underline}** of Article I as if it is possible to amend the
Constitution **[with a wink and nod represents a mortal
threat]{.underline}** to the republic. If this can be done, what can\'t
be done?

My readers will know that I am far from squeamish about war. I have
questions about Libya, for example, but I am open to the idea that it is
a low-cost, politically appropriate measure. But I am not open to the
possibility that quickly after the commencement of hostilities the
president need not receive authority to wage war from Congress. And I am
arguing that neither the Congress nor the president has the authority to
substitute resolutions for declarations of war. Nor should either want
to. Politically, this has too often led to disaster for presidents.
Morally, committing the lives of citizens to waging war requires
meticulous attention to the law and proprieties.

**[As]{.underline}** our **[international power and interests surge, it
would seem reasonable that]{.underline}** our **[commitment to
republican principles would surge]{.underline}**. These commitments
appear inconvenient. They are meant to be. **[War is a serious matter,
and presidents and]{.underline}** particularly **[Congresses should be
inconvenienced on the road to war]{.underline}**. Members of **[Congress
should not]{.underline}** be able to **[hide behind ambiguous
resolutions]{.underline}** only to turn on the president during
difficult times, claiming that they did not mean what they voted for.
**[A vote on [a declaration]{.mark} of war]{.underline}** ends that. It
also **[[prevents a president from acting as king]{.mark} by
default]{.underline}**. Above all, it prevents the public from
pretending to be victims when their leaders take them to war. **[The
[possibility of war will concentrate]{.mark} the mind of [a distracted
public like nothing else]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It turns voting into a
life-or-death matter, a tonic for our adolescent body politic.

And **[[if the president decides to unleash thermonuclear]{.mark} "fire
and [fury" on North Korea]{.mark}, [is there anything
Congress]{.mark}---or anyone else---[can do to stop
him?]{.mark}]{.underline}** At this juncture, the prospect that Trump's
erratic behavior might irreparably weaken the presidency seems like an
odd thing to worry about, yet some people do. "If Congress and the
courts diminish the power of the office to constrain him," Eric Posner
and Emily Bazelon wonder in the New York Times, "could they leave the
office too weak for future presidents to be able to govern effectively?"
Barack **[[Obama left]{.underline}]{.mark}** office **[[as the

### Prez Powers\-\--A2: No Groupthink

#### Executive decision making more likely to cause groupthink---distorts policy---cut off flow of info, downplay contrary views, no think long-term, underestimate risks, fail to develop contingency plans

**Streichler, 8** (Stuart -- Adjunct Faculty at Seattle University
School of Law and Ph.D. -- Johns Hopkins University and J.D. --
University of Michigan Law School, "Mad about Yoo, or, Why Worry about
the Next Unconstitutional War?", Journal of Law & Politics XXIV.93,
http://faculty.washington.edu/sstreich/documents/madaboutyoo.pdf)

**[Yoo expresses no doubt]{.underline}** that **[the president's
capacity to make decisions in foreign affairs]{.underline}** and
defense---to "consider policy choices" and to "evaluate threats"---**[is
"far superior" to Congress]{.underline}**'s.236 **[That overstates the
case]{.underline}**. Despite the imperfections of the legislative
process, it is hard to reach such an unqualified conclusion. Seemingly
**[for every [example]{.mark} where executive decision-making works
well]{.underline}**, **[another [can be cited]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[exposing]{.underline}**]{.mark} its
**[[deficiencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** President John F. Kennedy's
management of the Cuban missile crisis, though not without its critics,
is often cited as a classic model of decision-making in crisis. The same
president's handling of the Bay of Pigs invasion has been roundly
criticized.237

As Yoo presents his argument on executive decision-making, it does not
matter who occupies the office of the president. In fact, that can make
a good deal of difference. With **[the presidency structured around one
individual]{.underline}**, **[the [decision-making]{.mark} process [is
shaped by]{.mark} the chief [executive's]{.mark} native
[abilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[judgment, and
experience]{.underline}**]{.mark}.238 **[A whole range of personal
qualities may affect the president's decision]{.underline}** on whether
**[to take the nation to war]{.underline}**: how the president assesses
risk (especially with the uncertain conditions that prevail in foreign
affairs); whether he or she engages in wishful thinking; whether he or
she is practical, flexible, and openminded.239

**[While every president consults with advisers]{.underline}**,
[**[small group dynamics]{.underline}** **[add another
layer]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of difficulties in the executive
decision-making process]{.underline}**. **[Even
[talented]{.mark}]{.underline}** White House **[[staffers]{.mark} and
independent-minded cabinet secretaries]{.underline}** **[[succumb to
groupthink]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as it has been called---the overt and
subtle pressures driving group cohesiveness that can distort the
decisionmaking process.240 **[This effect can be pronounced in foreign
policy]{.underline}**, **[with stressful crises that]{.underline}**
often **[involve]{.underline}** morally **[difficult
choices]{.underline}**.241 **[[Members]{.mark} of the president's
team]{.underline}**, **[not]{.underline}** fully **[aware they are doing
so]{.underline}**, **[may [overrate]{.mark} their own
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}** or moral position, **[[cut off]{.mark} the
flow of [info]{.mark}]{.underline}**rmation, **[[downplay contrary
views]{.underline}]{.mark}** of outside experts, **[[limit consideration
of]{.mark} long-term [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[underestimate]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark} of a particular
policy]{.underline}**, **[[or fail to develop contingency
plans]{.underline}]{.mark}**.**[242 [Once the group coalesces]{.mark}
around a particular view]{.underline}**, **[[it becomes]{.mark}
increasingly [difficult]{.mark} for individual members [to press]{.mark}
the group to reassess]{.underline}** rejected
**[[alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**.243 The unique circumstances of
working for the president can make matters worse. **[[Members]{.mark} of
the administration]{.underline}** generally **[[share the
president's]{.mark} outlook]{.underline}**, **[[ideology]{.mark}, and
policy preferences]{.underline}**. **[Internal [decision-making may
get]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[skewed]{.underline}**
**[because]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[executive [officials give advice
based on what]{.mark} they think [the president wants]{.mark} to
hear]{.underline}**. Even if the president's subordinates differ with
the chief executive on particular questions, they can only go so far to
challenge the president.244

[**[what goes wrong with presidents]{.underline}**]{.mark} that
**[[there\'s a virtue of the]{.mark}]{.underline}** kind of
**[[deliberate or bargaining dynamic]{.underline}]{.mark}** that\'s
**[[required in Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And I think we\'re
seeing a little bit of that debate play out today. I think in the last
two years were in a situation where the Republican Congress until now
has handed the president, or I think Eric\'s right that he has the -
that Congress has given the president lots of leeway to do what the
president wants to do. And for me, I guess I see it in not dire terms,
but I do think the president not very competent and probably not getting
the most out of the kinds of actions he is doing is still moving in some
pretty aggressive ways. If you take his bully pulpit power, I don\'t
think it\'s insignificant the kind of language, he\'s just unleashed on
individuals and institutions without any kind of recourse. I do think
you know without getting support for almost anything on Capitol Hill
even when Republicans were in control he used his executive authority
pretty effectively on deregulatory matters including with climate
change. And I do think there\'s something different in terms of this
invocation of National Security a () and that the crisis it\'s not there
is no crisis and there\'s just not support for the idea. There\'s any
kind of Border crisis. So whereas other examples such as Bush after 9/11
or even Carter after the Iran hostage crisis. There\'s something real
there reacting to and you could dispute if emergency power was the best
way to go. This is a political campaign message. That\'s all of a sudden
turned into the basis of this use of power and. Added to that it\'s
using the power to spend money after Congress Republican Congress
didn\'t support it. Now a divided Congress doesn\'t support the use of
money that he wants and he\'s using the power to spend money that way
for me. That\'s a. Kind of National Emergency action by the president
then we\'ve seen and I think it could really set up a dangerous
precedent. And I think that\'s partly why some Republicans are just as
unsettled by this as Democrats are.

terrorists take American soldiers or travelers hostage and torture them
as some kind of sick retaliation for Abu Gharib. The greater issue
presented by the Defense department memo, however, is the threat posed
by unchecked executive power. Defense department lawyers essentially
argue that a president's powers as Commander-In-Chief override federal
laws prohibiting torture, and the Justice department appears to agree.
**[But the argument for extraordinary wartime executive powers has been
made time and time again, always with bad results and the loss of our
liberties. War has been used by presidents to excuse the imprisonment of
American citizens of Japanese descent, to silence speech, to suspend
habeas corpus, and even to control entire private
industries.]{.underline}** It is precisely during times of relative
crisis that we should adhere most closely to the Constitution, not
abandon it. War does not justify the suspension of torture laws any more
than it justifies the suspension of murder laws, the suspension of due
process, or the suspension of the Second amendment. We are fighting
undeclared wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and an open-ended war against
terrorism worldwide. If the president claims extraordinary wartime
powers, and we fight undeclared wars with no beginning and no end, when
if ever will those extraordinary powers lapse? Since terrorism will
never be eliminated completely, **[[should all future presidents be able
to act without regard to Congress or the Constitution simply by
asserting "We're at war"?]{.mark}]{.underline}** Conservatives should
understand that the power given the president today will pass to the
president's successors, who may be only too eager to abuse that
unbridled power domestically to destroy their political enemies.
Remember the anger directed at President Clinton for acting "above the
law" when it came to federal perjury charges? **[[An imperial presidency
threatens all of us who oppose unlimited state power over our
lives.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[A strong separation of powers is at the
heart of our constitutional liberties. [No branch of government should
be able to act unilaterally,]{.mark} no matter how cumbersome the
legislative process may be. The beauty of the Constitution is that it
encourages some degree of gridlock in government, making it harder for
any branch to act capriciously or secretly. [When we give any president
--- one man --- too much power, we build a foundation for future
tyranny.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[really, really know]{.underline}** **[we\'re in

\"**[it]{.underline}** already **[seems safe to conclude]{.underline}**
that **[we won't]{.underline}** be **[see]{.underline}**ing a monthly

rising sea levels, with scientists estimating that over 13 million
Americans might have to move by 2100. While 400 ppm is more of a
symbolic point than an actual tipping point (for example, there\'s not a
huge difference between 395 ppm and 405 ppm), the
**[findings]{.underline}** at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii **[are
troubling because September is typically]{.underline}** the **[lowest

explained, \"**[[By November, we will]{.mark} be marching]{.underline}**

highs and perhaps even **[[break]{.mark}ing the [410 ppm]{.mark}

only carbon dioxide monitoring station that hadn\'t reached a reading of
400 ppm, but they passed that mark in June---for the first time in

#### But, no impact

**Lehr 19 --** Jay Lehr, Ph.D. in Groundwater Hydrology from the
University of Arizona, and Tom Harris, Executive Director of the
International Climate Science Coalition, "Global Warming Myth Debunked:
Humans Have Minimal Impact on Atmosphere's Carbon Dioxide and Climate",

\[language modified\]

Global **[warming activists argue carbon-dioxide emissions are
destroying the planet, but the [climate impacts]{.mark} of carbon
dioxide [are minimal, at worst]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Activists would
also have you believe fossil-fuel emissions have driven carbon-dioxide
concentrations to their highest levels in history. The Obama-era
Environmental Protection Agency went so far as to classify carbon
dioxide as a toxic pollutant, and it established a radical goal of
closing all of America's coal-fired power plants.

**[Claims of unprecedented]{.underline}** carbon-dioxide **[levels
ignore most of Earth's 4.6-billion-year history. Relative to Earth's
entire record, carbon-dioxide [levels are at historic]{.mark}ally
[low]{.mark} levels; they only appear high when compared to the
dangerously low levels of carbon dioxide that occurred in Earth's very
recent history. The geologic record reveals [carbon]{.mark} dioxide [has
almost always been in]{.mark} Earths' atmosphere in much [greater
concentrations]{.mark} than it is today. For example, [600 million years
ago]{.mark}, when history's greatest birth of new animal species
occurred]{.underline}**, atmospheric carbon-dioxide **[concentrations
exceeded 6,500]{.underline}** parts per million **[(ppm) --- an amount
that's [17 times greater]{.mark} than it is today]{.underline}**.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently only 410 parts per million. That
means only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere is carbon dioxide (compared to
0.03 percent one century ago). Only one molecule in 2,500 is carbon
dioxide. Such levels certainly do not pose a health risk, as
carbon-dioxide levels in our naval submarines, which stay submerged for
months at a time, contain an average carbon-dioxide concentration of
5,000 ppm.

The geologic record is important because it reveals relationships
between carbon-dioxide levels, climate, and life on Earth. **[Over
billions of years, the [geologic record shows]{.mark} there is
[no]{.mark} long-term [correlation between]{.mark} atmospheric
[carbon]{.mark}-dioxide levels [and]{.mark} Earth's [climate. There are
periods]{.mark} in Earth's history [when]{.mark} carbon dioxide
[concentrations were many times higher]{.mark} than they are today, [yet
temperatures]{.mark} were identical to, or even [colder]{.mark} than,
modern times. [The claim]{.mark} that fossil-fuel [emissions
control]{.mark} atmospheric [carbon]{.mark}-dioxide concentrations
[is]{.mark} also [invalid, as]{.mark} atmospheric
[concentrations]{.mark} have [gone up]{.mark} and down in the geological
record, [even without human influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The absurdity of climate alarmism claims gets even stranger when you
consider there are 7.5 billion people on our planet who, together,
exhale 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year, which is almost 10
percent of total fossil-fuel emissions every year. However, we are but a
single species. Combined, people and all domesticated animals contribute
10 billion tons.

Further, **[9 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions from all living things
arise not from animals, but from anaerobic bacteria and
fungi]{.underline}**. These organisms metabolize dead plant and animal
matter in soil via decay processes that recycle carbon dioxide back into
the atmosphere. The grand total produced by all living things is
estimated to be 440 billion tons per year, or 13 times the amount of
carbon dioxide currently being produced by fossil-fuel emissions.
**[[Fossil-fuel]{.mark} emissions [are less than 10 percent of]{.mark}
biological [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Are you laughing yet?

**[Every [apocalyptic pronouncement]{.mark} you hear or read [is
\[totally wrong\]]{.mark}]{.underline}** ~~nothing short of insanity~~.
Their primary goal is not to save plants, humans, or animals, but rather
to use climate "dangers" as a justification for centralizing power in
the hands of a select few.

Jerusalem Institute for Market Studies, "There is Always Time for
Rational Skepticism: Reply to Hall et al," April, ScienceDirect

The uncertainty that encompasses current climate change assessments is
strengthened in light of the studies indicating that [[over]{.mark}
earth\'s [history there have been]{.mark} **distinct [warm
periods]{.mark}** [with tem]{.mark}perature[s **exceeding**]{.mark}
**the [current ones]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Esper et al., 2012, McIntyre
and McKittrick, 2003 and Soon and Baliunas, 2003). [Reviewing the
relevant scientific literature, Khandekar, Murty, and Chittibabu
(2005]{.underline}) [concluded that "in the context of the earth\'s
climate through the last 500 million years, the
[recent]{.mark}]{.underline} (1975--2000) [[increase]{.mark} in the
earth\'s mean temperature [does not appear]{.mark} to be **unusual** or
**[unprecedented]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as claimed by IPCC and many
supporters of the global warming hypothesis]{.underline}" (p. 1568).
Other studies challenged the mainstream climate change narrative,
according to which CO2 levels in the earth\'s atmosphere play a
prominent role in rising temperatures. One notable example is the
research by Shaviv and Veizer (2003), which demonstrates that the
earth\'s temperature correlates well with variations in cosmic ray flux,
rather than changes in atmospheric CO2. These findings and others stir
contentious debates within the climate scientific community, but are
nevertheless largely overlooked by the IPCC, which ignores alternative
explanations for climate change. Regrettably, Hall et al. scornfully
dismiss this evidence, presented in our research note, based on
cherry-picking of a few "non-peer-reviewed" references that were cited,
some vague claims about "misreading" and "selective citing," as well as
other semantic nitpicking. 4. Impacts of climate change [The
[IPCC]{.mark} warns that climate change is likely to have severe
consequences, particularly for poor countries, such as increased hunger,
water shortages, vulnerability to extreme weather events and
debilitating diseases. **However**, these [estimations]{.mark} have been
**heavily criticized** for [fail]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} properly
[account for]{.mark} **substantial improvements in [adaptive
capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., the capability of coping with the
impact of global warming) [that are likely to occur [due to]{.mark}
advances in [**economic development**, **technological change** and
**human capital**]{.mark} over the next century]{.underline} (Goklany,
2007). [Fostering economic growth and technological development, largely
achievable through the use of fossil fuels]{.underline}, [will
strengthen both industrialized and developing countries\' **adaptive
capacity** to deal not just with possible future climate change
consequences, but also with other environmental and public health
problems]{.underline}. [Such policy will **provide greater benefits** at
lower costs than drastic climate change mitigation efforts involving
substantially cutting greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} (Goklany,
2004 and Goklany, 2012). Furthermore, the analyses of Galiana and Green
(2009) exemplify that in the current state of energy technologies, the
suggested plans for ambitious emission reductions will likely severely
clobber the global economy, especially in view of present economic
conditions. In order to stabilize atmospheric CO2 at accepted levels,
there is a need for enormous advances in efficient energy technology,
which is currently missing (Pielke, Wigley & Green, 2008). In any case,
[**even if** every industrialized nation meets the most ambitious
emissions targets set by the Kyoto Protocol]{.underline}, [such efforts
are likely to have **little effect**]{.underline}, [particularly in the
light of the considerable increases in greenhouse gas emissions by
rising economic superpowers as **China** and **India**, as well as the
**remaining developing world**]{.underline} (Wigley, 1998). Hall et al.
criticized us for choosing "selective citations...that discuss natural
processes potentially affect climate in specific locations and times."
Yet the purpose of referring to such studies was to refute the claims
made by the IPCC and other climate change alarmists to the effect that
recent extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts and storms) are
the consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.
Moreover, data shows that despite claims that the number and intensity
of extreme weather has increased, between 1900 and 2010 the average
annual death and death rates from extreme weather events has declined by
93% and 98%, respectively (Goklany, 2009). This is mostly due to
economic and technological factors, such as improved global food
production, increase globalized food trade and better disaster
preparedness. IPCC\'s exaggerated estimations of climate change impacts
were also noted in an op-ed in Financial Times written by climate
economist Richard Tol (2014), a week following his demand that his name
as one of the leading authors be removed from the IPCC\'s AR5 due to its
over alarmist assessments of the impacts of AGW and underestimation of
humanity\'s adaptive capacity. As concluded by Tol, "[[Humans
are]{.mark} a **[tough]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[adaptable]{.mark}**
species]{.underline}. People live on the equator and in the Arctic, in
the desert and in the rainforest. [**[We survived ice ages]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[primitive
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**. [The idea that climate change poses
an existential threat to humankind is]{.underline}
**[laughable]{.underline}**" (2014, para 1).

#### [Long timeframe]{.underline} lets [adaptation]{.underline} solve most of the impact

Perspective", Social Research, Fall2015, Vol. 82 Issue 3, p727

The Benefits of Mitigation Are Modest and Delayed

The popular [literature on climate change]{.underline} is [rife with
claims that climate change is equivalent to an apocalypse. Whether
[climate]{.mark} change leads to an [apocalypse depends on]{.mark} many
factors, including]{.underline} [**[no mitigation]{.underline}**, **[no
adaptation]{.underline}**, **[and unlucky]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[uncertain [events]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Probably the three most
frightening images of climate change are tropical cyclones, floods, and
droughts. Although all these events are likely to occur in a future
climate, they are also an integral component of the current climate. We
already have droughts, floods, and tropical cyclones. The question is,
how will these things change?

According to economic models of fossil fuel consumption, [emissions of
greenhouse gases are expected to double the concentrations of greenhouse
gases]{.underline} from preindustrial levels of 275 part per million
equivalent (ppme) to 550 ppme [by 2040--2050. It will take more than
another 100 years to double concentrations]{.underline} again to 1,100
ppme [in the absence of mitigation. So despite the fact that fossil fuel
consumption is causing a vast quantity of annual emissions]{.underline},
**[[it takes a very long time for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[concentrations of greenhouse [gases]{.mark} in the atmosphere [to
double]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

According to climate models, a doubling of concentrations is expected to
increase long-run average global temperature by 3°C, with a range
between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees (IPCC 2014a). However, [[there is
a]{.underline} **[long lag]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[between]{.mark} an
[increase in concentrations and]{.mark} the resulting
[temperature]{.mark} increase. One must warm the ocean to warm the
climate. It takes several decades just to warm the upper layers of the
ocean]{.underline}. **[[It takes centuries]{.mark} for the long-run
temperature to be reached.]{.underline}**

The rising temperature is expected to increase the speed of the
hydrological cycle. This will lead to an increase in evaporation, an
increase in precipitation, and an increase in the amount of water in the
atmosphere. Water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas. It represents a
positive feedback mechanism and it contributes significantly to the
prediction of a 3°C increase from doubling greenhouse gases. So the
expectation of increased rainfall is part of the explanation why there
is such a large temperature increase. That does not mean there will be
increased rainfall everywhere. It simply means that average global
rainfall will increase.

The level of CO2 has a direct effect on ecosystems. All plants respond
to higher CO2 levels in a positive fashion. Grasses respond only
slightly to CO2 fertilization, whereas the yields of most crops respond
vigorously. Hundreds of laboratory studies reveal an average increase in
crop yields of 30 percent as CO2 concentrations double (Kimball 2007).

Climate change is expected to melt ice formations. Many glaciers on land
have already shrunk in response to warming, increasing flows in nearby
rivers. The Arctic ice covering the sea in the North Pole is shrinking
rapidly, exposing the Arctic air to the warm sea underneath and causing
the most rapid warming on the planet (IPCC 2014a). Large remaining
glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica might melt over the next thousand
years (IPCC 2014a). The melting of the large ice deposits in Greenland
and Antarctica would cause the oceans to rise to new levels never before
experienced by mankind.

Climate change is expected to have one final impact. In addition to the
mean temperature and precipitation levels rising, there may be a change
in the distribution of weather. Seasonal patterns may change with more
warming in winter than summer. Interannual variance might change.
Diurnal variance may drop as nights become warmer relative to days.
Tropical cyclones may become more powerful. The pattern of global winds
may change, shifting moisture from one place to another. More is known
about global mean changes than these other changes in the distribution.
It is more difficult to study variance and even more difficult to study
extreme events. But it is likely that the distribution of weather events
will change.

What then is the consequence of climate change if greenhouse gases cause
all these changes? What sectors of the economy are vulnerable? What
nonmarket goods and services are at risk?

The literature on impacts has long identified most of the sectors likely
to be affected by climate change (Pearce et al. 1996). The vulnerable
economic sectors include agriculture, coasts, forests, water, and
energy. Important sectors outside the economy that would be affected
include recreation, ecosystem change, human health, and aesthetics. The
controversy about impacts does not concern what will be affected. The
controversy is measuring the magnitude of the impact. Some studies
report damages to mankind equal to 20 percent of total income (Stern
2007). Other **[[studies suggest]{.mark} more [modest effects]{.mark}
[of less than 2 percent of income]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Pearce et al.
1996; Nordhaus 1991). [Yet other studies suggest impacts may be closer
to 0.2 percent of income]{.underline} (Mendelsohn et al. 2006). What
explains estimates that vary by orders of magnitude?

[Although some authors]{.underline} **[speculate about exponentially
increasing damage]{.underline}** (Stern 2007), **[[empirical analysis
suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}**s that **[most [sectors respond]{.mark} to
temperature [in a hill-shaped fashion]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Mendelsohn
and Schlesinger 1999; Tol 2002a). [For each sector, there is an ideal
temperature where the net value of that sector is highest]{.underline}.
If temperatures are either colder or warmer than this ideal, warming
will be either beneficial or harmful, respectively.

Three important insights follow from this result. First, [warming will
be beneficial to relatively cool countries and harmful to relatively
warm countries. Warming will not have the same universal effect on
everybody]{.underline}. Low-latitude countries may well suffer 60 to 80
percent of the global damage (Mendelsohn et al. 2006). This is
problematic because these low-latitude countries collectively contribute
only a small fraction of global emissions. A large fraction of the
damage from climate change is not suffered by the countries causing the
emissions. There is an inherent inequity in the distribution of the
costs and benefits of greenhouse gas emissions.

Second, the warmer the planet gets, the more damage that warming will
cause. More and more countries will be pushed beyond the ideal
temperature range, and the more local temperatures exceed that range,
the greater the damage will be. Third, because the most serious damage
requires relatively high temperatures, **[[a large fraction of]{.mark}
the [damage will not occur until]{.mark} [far into the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The present value of damage is
consequently quite small.

The literature also contains one other important insight. **[[Adaptation
is very effective]{.mark} at lowering climate damage]{.underline}**
(Mendelsohn and Neumann 1999; Mendelsohn and Dinar 2009). **[[Firms,
farms, and people will all change]{.mark} their [behavior]{.mark} as
climate changes.]{.underline}** [[They will]{.mark} subtly [adjust their
timing]{.mark}, their [choices]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} their [management
to take into account]{.mark} [the climate]{.mark} that [they]{.mark}
actually [live in]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} One can see this today
by comparing the behavior of people who happen to live in different
climates. Farmers in warmer places plant crops suitable for that
climate. People wear clothing appropriate to their climate and season.
Buildings have heating and cooling systems appropriate for each climate.
People and firms adapt to climate because it is in their interest to do
so. **[Adaptation makes them better off]{.underline}**. That does not
imply there are no damages. It simply points out that **[[assuming zero
adaptation is not realistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The damage is much
lower when people adjust. It may be more difficult to predict what will
happen with adaptation]{.underline}, **[but simply assuming it away
leads to overly pessimistic predictions of damage]{.underline}**.
[Predictions of impacts from climate change must take private adaptation
into account in order to provide accurate measures of future
damages]{.underline} (Mendelsohn 2000).

### Prez Powers\-\--A2: Turn\-\--Climate\-\--Ext\-\--Inevitable

#### It's irreversible

**Adler 15** -- Ben Adler, Grist Journalist on Environmental Policy and
Politics, 6/22/15, \"James Hansen's New Climate Study is Terrifying, but
He Still Has Hope,\"
<https://grist.org/climate-energy/james-hansens-new-climate-study-is-terrifying-but-he-still-has-hope/>

[Hansen and his colleagues]{.underline} combined analysis of the
historical record with modeling and current observation and [found that
the rate of oceanic ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica may exceed
our expectations.]{.underline} As InsideClimate News explains, the
scientists "analyzed how [an influx of cold freshwater from the planet's
[melting ice sheets will disrupt]{.mark} the [ocean]{.mark}'s
[circulation]{.mark} ... They concluded the influx of freshwater from
melting ice sheets in modern times would essentially shut down the
ocean's circulation, [causing]{.mark} cool water to stay in the
[Earth]{.mark}'s polar regions and equatorial water [to **warm**]{.mark}
**up even [faster]{.mark}**."]{.underline} "The cooling mechanism is cut
off, so it's melting ice shelves," Hansen explained in an interview with
Grist. ["It's a really dangerous situation where you get
**[melting]{.mark} that [causes more melting]{.mark}**."]{.underline}
Hansen also says that in the past, [temperature [increases of **1
degree**]{.mark} **Celsius** have [resulted in higher sea levels]{.mark}
than we have projected]{.underline} to accompany that temperature rise
in the future. The bottom line, as Slate's Eric Holthaus writes, is that
["glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than
previous consensus estimates, resulting in sea-level rise of at least 10
feet in as little as 50 years."]{.underline} A sea-level rise of [10
feet would inundate parts of major cities from New York to
Shanghai.]{.underline} These findings, if accurate, have major policy
implications. You're probably familiar with the the target of keeping
global average temperatures from increasing more than 2 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels. It's a widely cited goal for the climate
movement, based on a combination of the best we can realistically hope
to achieve and estimates of the threshold at which dangerous feedback
loops will begin to make global warming and its effects escalate
exponentially. So far, [**we've already warmed about
0.8C**,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} even if we turned off the
greenhouse gas spigot tomorrow, [[we've got a couple of decades of
warming ahead]{.mark} of us [from]{.mark} our [recent
emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Meanwhile, as global emissions keep
rising, some scientists argue that [**[2C is]{.mark} at this point
[already]{.mark} an [unrealistic]{.mark} goal** because the global
community simply isn't reducing emissions enough to get
there.]{.underline} But [Hansen's study suggests that even 2C is too
unambitious, [and]{.mark} that [the point]{.mark} at which
**[warming]{.mark} [becomes exponential]{.mark} instead of linear**
[is]{.mark} more like [1.5C.]{.mark}]{.underline} Other scientists have
reached similar conclusions recently, like those behind a U.N. report
issued in May that looked at the effect of sea-level rise on Pacific
island nations. And so Hansen frames his findings as a plea to world
leaders to pursue that new target.

[[Signs indicate we\'ve **reached the threshold**]{.mark} scientists
fear, [heralding **abrupt**]{.mark} **and [irreversible
change]{.mark}**.]{.underline} At 2C over the pre-industrial average,
[the [warming we]{.mark} have [already caused will trigger effects we
cannot control, including huge releases]{.mark} of carbon dioxide
[from]{.mark} the warming [oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}. Photo / AP If
you spend a lot of time talking to scientists about climate change,
there\'s one word you\'ll hear time and time again, and yet it\'s hardly
ever mentioned in the public discussion of climate change. The word is
\"non-linear\". Most people think of global warming as an incremental
thing. It may be inexorable, but it\'s also predictable. Alas, most
people are wrong. The climate is a very complex system, and complex
systems can change in non-linear ways. In other words, you [cannot count
on]{.underline} the [average global temp]{.underline}erature [rising
steadily but slowly]{.underline} as we pump more and more greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere. It may do that - but [[there may]{.mark} also
[be a sudden jump]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [average global
temp]{.underline}erature [that lands you in a world of hurt. That may be
happening now]{.underline}. \"[We are moving into uncharted territory
with frightening speed]{.underline},\" said Michel Jarraud,
secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organisation, last
November. He was [referring to the unprecedented way the warming is now
accelerating. The hottest year ever was 2014 - until 2015 beat it by a
wide margin; 2016 may beat it by an even wider margin.]{.underline} It
was the hottest January ever - and then the average global temperature
in February was a full fifth of a degree Celsius higher than January.
That was [a huge jump]{.underline}, since the \"average global
temperature\" is an average of all the temperatures over the seas and
the land in both the summer hemisphere and the winter hemisphere. [It is
normally a very stable figure, changing no more than a few hundredths of
a degree from year to year.]{.underline} But March was not only hotter
than February, it was hotter by an even wider margin than February was
over January. Indeed, each of the past 11 months has beaten the highest
previously recorded average temperature for that month. *It could be
some random short-term fluctuation \... \[but\]* [it feels a lot more
like part of a trend]{.underline}. Some people try to explain this all
away by blaming it on El Nino, a periodical rise in the ocean surface
temperature in the eastern Pacific that moves the rainfall patterns
around worldwide, causing droughts here and floods there. But El Nino is
a LOCAL rise in temperature, it does not normally affect the average
global temperature much. The frightening acceleration in the warming in
the past three months has no precedent in any El Nino year, or indeed in
any previous year. It could be some random short-term fluctuation in
average global temperature, but coming on top of the record warming of
2014 and 2015 it feels a lot more like part of a trend. [[Could this be
non-linear]{.mark} change, an [abrupt and **irreversible**]{.mark}
change? **[Yes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And if it is, how far will it go
before it stabilises again at some higher average global temperature?
Nobody knows. Last year the average global temperature hit 1C higher
than the pre-industrial average. That is halfway to the plus-two degree
level which all the world\'s Governments have agreed we must never
exceed, but at least we got to plus-one slowly, over a period of two
centuries. The plus-two threshold matters because that\'s when the
warming we have already caused triggers effects we cannot control: the
loss of the Arctic sea-ice, the melting of the permafrost, and immense
releases of CO2 from the warming oceans. After plus-two, we will no
longer be able to stop the warming by ending our own greenhouse gas
emissions. Even at the global climate summit in Paris in December, there
was still hope we might avoid triggering the effects, because the
historic rate of warming would still give us about 25 years to work on
cutting our emissions before we reach plus-two. But if the current
non-linear surge in warming persists, we could have covered half the
remaining distance and reached plus 1.5C by the end of this year.
Obviously most scientists will not go this far in public, but they are
very worried. [As Professor Stefan Rahmstorf]{.underline} of the Potsdam
Institute of Climate Impact Research [told]{.underline} the *Guardian*
recently: \"[[We are in a]{.mark} kind of climate [emergency]{.mark}
now]{.underline}.\" Ten years ago I spent almost a year interviewing the
world\'s leading climate scientists for a book I was writing. I learned
[[all]{.mark} our [calculations]{.mark} for dealing with climate change
c[ould be swept aside by a non-linear event]{.mark}. This could be
it.]{.underline}

"Empirical evidence for a celestial origin of the climate oscillations
and its implications," Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial

On secular, millenarian and larger time scales **[[astronomical
oscillations and solar changes drive climate
variations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Shaviv's]{.underline}
[theory]{.underline} \[2003\] [can explain]{.underline} the
[large]{.underline} 145 Myr [climate oscillations during]{.underline}
the last **[600 million years.]{.underline}** Milankovic's theory
\[1941\] can explain the multi-millennial climate oscillations¶ observed
during the last 1000 kyr. [Climate oscillations with]{.underline}¶
[periods of 2500, 1500, and 1000 years during the]{.underline} last
10,000¶ year (the [Holocene]{.underline}) [are correlated to equivalent
solar cycles]{.underline}¶ [that caused the Minoan, Roman, Medieval and
Modern warm]{.underline}¶ [periods]{.underline} \[Bond *et al.*, 2001;
Kerr, 2001\]. Finally, several other¶ authors found that multisecular
solar oscillations caused bisecular¶ little ice ages (for example: the
Sp¨orer, Maunder, Dalton¶ minima) during the last 1000 years \[for
example: Eddy,¶ 1976; Eichler *et al.*, 2009; Scafetta and West, 2007;
Scafetta, 2009, 2010\].

Herein, [we]{.underline} have [found [empirical evidences
that]{.mark}]{.underline} the climate¶
[[oscillations]{.underline}]{.mark} within the secular scale
[[are]{.mark} very likely [driven by¶ astronomical cycles]{.mark}, too.
Cycles]{.underline} with periods of 10-11, 12, 15,¶ 20-22, 30 and 60
years [are present **in all major surface temperature¶
records**]{.underline} [since 1850, and can be easily linked
to]{.underline} the [orbits]{.underline}¶ of Jupiter and Saturn. The 11
and 22-year cycles are the wellknown¶ Schwabe and Hale solar cycles.
Other faster cycles with¶ periods between 5 and 10 years are in common
between the¶ temperature records and the astronomical cycles. Long-term¶
lunar cycles induce a 9.1-year cycle in the temperature records¶ and
probably other cycles, including an 18.6-year cycle in some¶ regions
\[McKinnell and Crawford, 2007\]. [A quasi-60 year cycle]{.underline}¶
[has been found in numerous multi-secular climatic
records]{.underline},¶ and it is even present in the traditional
Chinese, Tibetan and¶ Tamil calendars, which are arranged in major
60-year cycles.¶ [The physical mechanisms that would explain this result
are]{.underline}¶ [still unknown. Perhaps]{.underline} the four jovian
[planets modulate solar]{.underline}¶ [activity via gravitational and
magnetic forces that cause tidal]{.underline}¶ [and angular momentum
stresses on the Sun and its heliosphere.]{.underline}

Then, [a [varying Sun]{.mark} modulates climate, which
[amplifies]{.mark} the effects¶ of the solar input through several
[feedback mechanisms]{.mark}.¶ This phenomenon is mostly regulated by
Jupiter]{.underline} and [Saturn]{.underline},¶ plus some important
contribution [from Neptune and Uranus]{.underline},¶ which modulate a
bi-secular cycle with their 172 year synodic¶ period. This
interpretation is supported by the fact that the [11-]{.underline}¶
[year solar cycles and the solar flare occurrence appear
synchronized]{.underline}¶ [to the tides generated on]{.underline} the
Sun by Venus, [Earth]{.underline} and¶ Jupiter \[Hung, 2007\]. Moreover,
[a 60-year cycle and other¶ planetary cycles have been found in
millennial solar records¶]{.underline} \[Ogurtsov *et al.*, 2002\]
[and]{.underline} in the number of [middle latitude¶
auroras]{.underline} \[Komitov, 2009\].

Alternatively, the planets are directly influencing the Earth's¶ climate
by modulating the orbital parameters of the Earth-Moon¶ system and of
the Earth. Orbital parameters can modulate the¶ Earth's angular momentum
via gravitational tides and magnetic¶ forces. Then, these orbital
oscillations are amplified by the climate¶ system through
synchronization of its natural oscillators.¶ This interpretation is
supported by the fact that the temperature¶ records contain a clear
9.1-year cycle, which is associated to¶ some long-term lunar tidal
cycles. However, the climatic influence¶ of theMoon may be more subtle
because several planetary¶ cycles are also found in the Earth-Moon
system.¶ The astronomical forcings may be modulating the length¶ of the
day (LOD). LOD presents a 60-year cycle that anticipates¶ the 60-year
temperature cycle \[Klyashtorin 2001; Klyashtorin¶ and Lyubushin, 2007,
2009; Mazzarella, 2007, 2008;¶ Sidorenkov and Wilson, 2009\]. A LOD
change can drive the¶ ocean oscillations by exerting some pressure on
the ocean floor¶ and by modifying the Coriolis' forces. In particular,
the large¶ ocean oscillations such as the AMO and PDO oscillations are¶
likely driven by astronomical oscillations.¶ The [results]{.underline}
herein found [show]{.underline} that [the climate
[oscillations]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ [are [driven by **multiple
astronomical mechanisms**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Indeed, the¶
[planets]{.underline} with their [movement cause the entire solar system
to]{.underline}¶ [vibrate]{.underline} with a set of frequencies that
are closely related to the¶ orbital periods of the planets. The
[wobbling of the Sun]{.underline} around¶ the center of mass of the
solar system [is]{.underline} just [the clearest
manifestation]{.underline}¶ [of these solar system
vibrations]{.underline} and has been used¶ herein just as a proxy for
studying those vibrations. The Sun,¶ the Earth-Moon system and the Earth
feel these oscillations,¶ and it is reasonable that the [internal
physical processes of the]{.underline}¶ [Earth and the Sun
synchronize]{.underline} to them.

It is evident that we can still infer, by means of a detailed data¶
analysis, that **[[the solar system]{.mark} likely
[induces]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[climate
[oscillations]{.mark}]{.underline}**,¶ although the actual mechanisms
that explain the observed¶ climate oscillations are still unknown. [If
the true climate mechanisms]{.underline}¶ [were already known and well
understood, the general]{.underline}¶ [circulation climate models would
properly reproduce]{.underline} the [cli-]{.underline}¶ [mate
oscillations.]{.underline} However, we found that [this is not the
case.]{.underline}¶ For example, we showed that [the GISS ModelE fails
to reproduce]{.underline}¶ the climate [oscillations at multiple time
scales, including]{.underline}¶ [the]{.underline} large 60[-year
cycle.]{.underline} This [[failure is common to all]{.mark} climate¶
[models adopted by the IPCC]{.mark}]{.underline} \[2007\] as it is
evident in their figures¶ 9.5 and SPM.5 that show the multi-model global
average¶ simulation of surface warming. This failure indicates that the¶
models on which the [[IPCC's claims]{.mark} are based are still
**incomplete¶ and possibly [flawed]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The existence of a 60-year natural cycle in the climate system,¶ which
is clearly proven in multiple studies and herein in¶ Figures 2, 6, 10
and 12, indicates that the AGWT promoted by¶ the IPCC \[2007\], which
claims that 100% of the global warming¶ observed since 1970 is
anthropogenic, is erroneous. In fact,¶ since 1970 a globalwarming of
about 0.5 *oC* has been observed.¶ However, from 1970 to 2000 the
60-year natural cycle was in¶ his warming phase and has contributed no
less than 0.3 *oC* of the¶ observed 0.5 *oC* warming, as Figure 10B
shows. Thus, [**at least¶ [60% of]{.mark} the observed [warming]{.mark}
since 1970 [has been naturally]{.mark}¶ [induced]{.mark}.** This leaves
less than 40%]{.underline} of the observed warming¶ [to human
emissions.]{.underline} Consequently, the current climate
[models]{.underline},¶ by failing to simulate the observed quasi-60 year
temperature¶ cycle, [have significantly overestimated]{.underline} the
[climate sensitivity]{.underline}¶ [to]{.underline} anthropogenic [GHG
emissions by]{.underline} likely [a factor of three.]{.underline}¶
Moreover, the upward trend observed in the temperature data¶ since
1900may be partially due to land change use, uncorrected¶ urban heat
island effects \[McKitrick andMichaels, 2007;McKitrick,¶ 2010\] and to
the bi-secular and millennial solar cycles¶ that reached their maxima
during the last decades \[Bond *et al.*,¶ 2001; Kerr, 2001; Eichler *et
al.*, 2009; Scafetta, 2010\].

As already noted, [the [IPCC]{.mark} scenarios]{.underline} themselves
**[[are wildly alarmist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not only on the basic
science but also [on the]{.underline} **[underlying]{.underline}**
economic **[assumptions]{.underline}**, which in turn drive the alarmist
impacts. [The result]{.underline} **[cannot withstand critical
analysis]{.underline}**. Economists Ian Castles and David Henderson, for
example, show the extent to which the analysis is driven by the desire
to reach predetermined outcomes.50 Other economists have similarly
wondered what purpose was served by pursuing such unrealistic scenarios.
It is hard to credit the defense put forward by Mike Hulme, one of the
creators of the scenarios, that the IPCC is not engaged in forecasting
the future but in creating "plausible" story lines of what might happen
under various scenarios.51 [[Each]{.underline} **[scare
scenario]{.underline}** [is based on]{.underline}]{.mark} [linear
[projections without]{.mark}]{.underline} **[any [reference to
tech]{.mark}nological developments [or
adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If, on a similar linear basis, our
Victorian ancestors in the UK, worried about rapid urbanization and
population growth in London, had made similar projections, they would
have pointed to the looming crisis arising from reliance on horse-drawn
carriages and omnibuses; they would have concluded that by the middle of
the 20th century, London would be knee-deep in horse manure, and all of
the southern counties would be required to grow the oats and hay to feed
and bed the required number of horses. Technology progressed and London
adapted. **[Why should the rest of humanity not be able to do
likewise]{.underline}** [in the face of a trivial rise in temperature
over the course of **more than a century**]{.underline}? [The work on
physical impacts is]{.underline} **[equally over the top]{.underline}**.
[[All]{.mark} the [scenarios assume]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[only
negative impacts]{.underline}**, [ignore]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
reality of]{.underline} [**[adaptation]{.underline}**, [and attribute
**any**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**and all things [bad]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Assuming the GHG
theory to be correct means that its impact would be most evident at
night and during the winter]{.underline} in reducing atmospheric heat
loss to outer space.52 It would have greater impact in increasing
minimum temperatures than in increasing maximum temperatures. Secondary
[studies]{.underline}, however, generally **[ignore this
facet]{.underline}** of the hypothesis. [The IPCC believes that a warmer
world will harm human health]{.underline} [due]{.underline}, for
example, [to increased disease, malnutrition, heat-waves, floods,
storms, and cardiovascular incidents]{.underline}. As already noted
**[[there is no basis for]{.mark} the claim about
severe-[weather]{.mark}-related [threats or
malnutrition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The claim about heat-related deaths
gained a boost during the summer of 2003 because of the tragedy of some
15,000 alleged heat-related deaths in France as elderly people stayed
behind in city apartments without air conditioning while their children
enjoyed the heat at the sea shore during the August vacation.
Epidemiological studies of so-called \"excess\" deaths resulting from
heat waves are abused to get the desired results. Similar studies of the
impact of cold spells show that they are far more lethal than heat waves
and that it is much easier to adapt to heat than to cold.53 More
fundamentally, this, like most of the alarmist literature, ignores the
basics of the AGW hypothesis: the world will not see an exponential
increase in summer, daytime heat (and thus more heat waves), but a
decrease in night-time and winter cooling, particularly at higher
latitudes and altitudes. Based on the AGW hypothesis, Canada, China,
Korea, Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, and
Argentina will see warmer winters and warmer nights. There are clear
benefits to such a development, even if there may also be problems, but
the AGW industry tends to ignore the positive aspects of their alarmist
scenarios. The feared [spread of [malaria]{.mark}]{.underline}, a much
repeated claim, [[is]{.mark} largely [unrelated]{.mark} to
climate]{.underline}. [Malaria's worst recorded outbreak]{.underline}
**[was in Siberia long before there was any discussion of
AGW]{.underline}**. Similarly, the building of the Rideau Canal in
Ottawa in the 1820s was severely hampered by outbreaks of malaria due to
the proximity of mosquito-infested wetlands in the area. Malaria remains
widespread in tropical countries today in part because of the UN's
lengthy embargo on the use of DDT, the legacy of an earlier alarmist
disaster. Temperature is but one factor, and a minor one at that, in the
multiple factors that affect the rise or decline in the presence of
disease-spreading mosquitoes. Wealthier western countries have pursued
public health strategies that have reduced the incidence of the dis-
ease in their countries. Entomologist Paul Reiter, widely recognized as
the leading specialist on malaria vectors and a contributor to some of
the early work of the IPCC, was aghast to learn how his careful and
systematic analysis of the potential impacts had been twisted in ways
that he could not endorse. In a recent paper, he concludes: "Simplistic
reasoning on the future prevalence of malaria is ill-founded; malaria is
not limited by climate in most temperate regions, nor in the tropics,
and in nearly all cases, 'new\' malaria at high altitudes is well below
the maximum altitudinal limits for transmission. Future changes in
climate may alter the prevalence and incidence of the disease, but
obsessive emphasis on 'global warming\' as a dominant parameter is
indefensible; the principal determinants are linked to ecological and
societal change, politics and economics."54 **[Catastrophic [species
loss]{.mark}]{.underline}** [similarly [has]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[little foundation in]{.mark} past
[experience]{.mark}]{.underline}**.55 [[Even if]{.mark} the GHG
hypothesis were to be [correct]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[its impact
would be slow]{.underline}**, **[providing]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[significant [scope]{.mark} and opportunity for
[adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [including by ﬂora and
fauna]{.underline}. One of the more irresponsible claims was made by a
group of UK [[modelers]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[fed]{.mark} wildly
[improbable scenarios]{.mark} and data into their computers and produced
the much-touted claim of massive species loss]{.underline} by the end of
the century. [There are literally]{.underline} **[thousands of websites
devoted to spreading alarm about species loss]{.underline}** and
biodiversity. [Global [warming is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[but one of
many]{.mark} claimed human [threats to]{.mark} the planet's
[biodiversity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The [claims]{.mark},]{.underline}
fortunately, [[are]{.mark} largely [hype]{.mark}]{.underline}, based on
computer models and the estimate by Harvard naturalist Edward O. Wilson
that 27,000 to 100,000 species are lost annually - a figure he advanced
purely hypothetically but which has become one of the most persistent of
environmental urban myths. The fact is that [scientists]{.underline}
**[have no idea of the extent of the world\'s ﬂora and
fauna]{.underline}**, with estimates ranging from five million to 100
million species, and that [there are no reliable data about the rate of
loss]{.underline}. By some estimates, [[95 per cent of]{.mark} the
[species]{.mark} that ever existed [have been lost]{.mark} over the
eons]{.underline}, most before humans became major players in altering
their environment. A much more credible estimate of recent species loss
comes from a surprising source, the UN Environmental Program. It reports
that known **[species [loss is slowing reaching its lowest level in 500
years]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the last three decades of the 20th
century, with some 20 reported extinctions despite increasing pressure
on the biosphere from growing human population and industrialization.57
The alarmist community has also introduced the scientifically unknown
concept of \"locally extinct," often meaning little more than that [a
species of plant or animal has responded to adverse conditions by moving
to more hospitable circumstances]{.underline}, e.g., birds or
butterflies becoming more numerous north of their range and disappearing
at its extreme southern extent. Idso et al. conclude: "Many [species
have shown the ability to]{.underline} **[adapt rapidly to changes in
climate]{.underline}**. [[Claims that]{.mark} global [warming
threatens]{.mark}]{.underline} large numbers of species with
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [typically [rest
on]{.mark}]{.underline} a false definition of extinction (the loss of a
particular population rather than en- tire species) and **[[speculation
rather than]{.mark} real-world [evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The
world's [species have proven]{.mark}]{.underline} **[very
[resilient]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [having survived
past]{.underline}]{.mark} [natural climate [cycles that involved]{.mark}
much [greater warming]{.mark} and higher C02 concentrations
[than]{.mark} exist today or are [likely]{.mark} to exist [in]{.mark}
the [coming centuries]{.mark}?"]{.underline}

#### Extinction requires 12 degrees\-\--that [won't happen]{.underline}

[The [**most likely** levels of]{.mark} global [warming are **very
unlikely to cause**]{.mark} **human
[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15 The [[existential risks]{.mark} of
climate change]{.underline} instead [[stem from tail
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} climate change -- [[the **low probability** of
extreme]{.mark} levels of [warming]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [and
interaction with other sources of risk]{.underline}. It is impossible to
say with confidence at what point global warming would become severe
enough to pose an existential threat. Research has suggested that
[**warming of 11-[12°C]{.mark}** [would render]{.mark} most of [the
planet uninhabitable]{.mark}]{.underline},16 and would completely
devastate agriculture.17 This would pose an extreme threat to human
civilisation as we know it.18 Warming of around 7°C or more could
potentially produce conflict and instability on such a scale that the
indirect effects could be an existential risk, although it is extremely
uncertain how likely such scenarios are.19 Moreover, [the
[timescales]{.mark} over which such changes might happen could
[mean]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[humanity is able to
adapt]{.underline}]{.mark}** enough [[to avoid extinction in
**even**]{.mark} **very [extreme scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The probability of these levels of warming depends on eventual
greenhouse gas concentrations. According to some experts, [unless strong
action is taken soon by major emitters]{.underline}, it is likely that
[we will pursue a medium-high emissions pathway]{.underline}.20 If we
do, the chance of extreme warming is highly uncertain but appears
non-negligible. Current concentrations of greenhouse gases are higher
than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years,21 which means
that there are significant unknown unknowns about how the climate system
will respond. Particularly concerning is the risk of positive feedback
loops, such as the release of vast amounts of methane from melting of
the arctic permafrost, which would cause rapid and disastrous warming.22
The economists Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman have used IPCC figures
(which do not include modelling of feedback loops such as those from
melting permafrost) to estimate that [if we continue to pursue a
medium-high emissions pathway]{.underline}, the [[probability of]{.mark}
eventual warming of [6°]{.mark}C [is]{.mark} around
**[10%]{.mark}**]{.underline},23 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} of
[[10°]{.mark}C [is]{.mark}]{.underline} around
**[[3%]{.underline}]{.mark}**.24 [[These]{.mark} estimates
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} of course **[[highly
uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[It is **likely**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the world will take
action]{.mark} against climate change [once it begins to impose]{.mark}
large [costs]{.mark}]{.underline} on human society, **[[long
before]{.mark} there is warming of [10°]{.mark}C]{.underline}**.
Unfortunately, there is significant inertia in the climate system: there
is a 25 to 50 year lag between CO2 emissions and eventual warming,25 and
it is expected that 40% of the peak concentration of CO2 will remain in
the atmosphere 1,000 years after the peak is reached.26 Consequently, it
is impossible to reduce temperatures quickly by reducing CO2 emissions.
If the world does start to face costly warming, the international
community will therefore face strong incentives to find other ways to
reduce global temperatures.

[The]{.underline} **[[impacts of]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.mark} generally [estimated
using]{.mark}]{.underline} [chains of linked [computer
models]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Each chain begins with a climate
model]{.underline}, [which itself is driven by a set of socioeconomic
scenarios based on assumptions for population]{.underline}, economic
development and technological change over the entire period of the
analysis (often 50-- 100 years or more). [The climate model is followed
by various biophysical, economic and other downstream models to estimate
changes in different aspects of human]{.underline} 23
[activity]{.underline} or welfare, for example agriculture, forestry,
health or biodiversity. [The **[uncertain outputs]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of each upstream model serve as the inputs of the subsequent downstream
model]{.underline}, [with the]{.underline} [uncertainties]{.underline}
**[[cascad]{.mark}ing [down]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the chain so that
the individual streams of uncertainty combine into a regular
torrent.]{.underline} For example, to estimate the impacts on
agriculture and food security, the outputs of the climate model are fed
into various crop models to estimate yields, which then are linked to
economic models to estimate supply and demand for the various crops.
Supply and demand are then reconciled via national, regional and global
scale trade models.142 Notably, despite the cascade of uncertainties,
[to date]{.underline} **[[no]{.mark} climate change impact
[assessment]{.mark}]{.underline}** [has [provided
an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[objective estimate]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[of the cumulative uncertainty]{.underline}, starting with the
socioeconomic scenarios through to the impact estimate. The ranges of
uncertainty presented in the IPCC impact reports are generally based on
the uncertainties only from using different climate scenarios. But these
are much narrower than the true uncertainties that would have been
estimated had the full cascade of uncertainties been considered. Models
have not been validated [[One reason]{.mark} that]{.underline}
**[[doom-laden predictions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [about human wellbeing
have]{.underline} [**[failed]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that [orthodox]{.mark} climate [scientists]{.mark} have neglected to
apply the scientific method]{.underline}: [specifically they [have not
checked]{.mark} their [hypotheses and biases]{.mark} embodied in their
models]{.underline} against empirical reality. As we have seen, simple
reality checks show that [environmental and human wellbeing is not
currently deteriorating]{.underline}. Validation of these models using
such reality checks would have limited their divergence from reality,
and also reduce the uncertainties that are inevitably compounded as one
progresses down the chain of models. [Climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[overstate]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}** Firstly, [the global [climate has not
been warming]{.mark} **as [rapidly]{.mark}** as projected
in]{.underline} the IPCC assessment reports. Figure 5 compares observed
global surface temperature data from 1986 through 2012 versus modelled
results. It confirms that models have been running hotter than reality.
But these are the projections that governments have relied on to justify
global warming policies, including subsidies for biofuels and renewable
energy while increasing the overall cost of energy to the general
consumer -- costs that disproportionately burden those that are poorer.
A comparison of performance of 117 simulations using 37 models versus
empirical data from the HadCRUT4 surface temperature data set indicates
that the vast majority of the simulations/models have overestimated
warming.143 The models indicated that the average global temperature
would increase by 0.30±0.02◦Cper decade during the period from 1993 to
2012 but empirical data show an increase of only 0.14±0.06◦C per
decade.144 Model performance was even worse for the more recent 15-year
period of 1998--2012. Here the average modelled trend was 0.21±0.03◦C
per decade, quadruple the observed trend of 0.05±0.08◦C. Considering the
confidence interval, the observed trend is indistinguishable from no
trend at all; that is, warming has, for practical purposes, halted. Even
the IPCC acknowledges the existence of this 'hiatus'.145 Moreover, the
HadCRUT4 temperature database indicates that the global warming rate
declined from 0.11◦C per decade from 1951--2012 to 0.04◦C per decade
from 1998--2012.146 This is despite the fact that, per the IPCC, the
anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing for 2010 (2.25 W/m2) exceeded what
was used in the models for 2010 (1.78--1.84 W/m2) by around 25%.147 Some
have argued that satellite temperature data should be preferred over
surface datasets. In fact, satellite coverage is more comprehensive and
more representative of the Earth's surface than is achievable using
surface stations, even if the latter were to number in the thousands. A
recent review paper notes that satellites can provide 'unparalleled
global- and fine-scale spatial coverage' presumably because of 'more
frequent and repetitive coverage over a larger area than other
observation means'.148 In addition, surface measurements are influenced
by the measuring stations' microenvironments, which will vary not only
from station to station at any given time, but also over time at the
very same station, as vegetation and man-made structures in their
vicinity spring up, evolve and change.149 Satellite temperature data
indicates that the globe has been warming at the rate of 0.12--0.14◦C
per decade since 1979;150 by contrast, the IPCC assessments over the
last 25 years have been projecting a warming trend of 0.2--0.4◦C per
decade.151,152 The 25 differences between modelled trends and those from
satellites and weather balloons are shown in Figures 6 and 7.153
Nevertheless, [based on these chains of]{.underline} **[unvalidated
computer models]{.underline}**, **[orthodox thinkers]{.underline}** [on
climate change claim that global warming will]{.underline}, among other
things, lower food production, increase hunger, cause more extreme
weather, increase disease, and threaten water supplies. The cumulative
impact will, they claim, [diminish living standards and threaten
species, and]{.underline} if carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
are not curbed soon, **[pose an existential threat to
humanity]{.underline}** and the rest of nature. Some claim it may
already be too late.154 [The group 350]{.underline}.org, for instance,
[agitates for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, currently at
400 ppm, to 350 ppm]{.underline}, a level the earth last experienced [in
1988]{.underline}.155 But **[since then, global GDP per capita has
increased 60%, infant mortality has declined 48%,]{.underline}** **[life
expectancy has increased by 5.5]{.underline}** years, **[and the poverty
headcount has dropped from 43% to 17%]{.underline}** despite a
population increase of 40%. [Nostalgia for a 350 ppm world
seems]{.underline} somewhat misplaced, if not **[downright
perverse]{.underline}**.156,157 Climate models don't do local well It is
not clear what logical process was used to arrive at these allegations.
It may stem from the fact that orthodox thinkers on climate, in the grip
of confirmation bias, are unable or unwilling to acknowledge that,
unless a climate or weather event is truly unprecedented then the
default assumption -- the 'null hypothesis' in scientific parlance --
should be that it is part of normal climate variability rather than
manmade global warming. Some have used the results of modelling
exercises that purport to assess the future impacts, usually in the
latter part of this century, and then 'interpolated' these results back
to the present day.158,159,160 The first step in such an exercise relies
on climate models to project the future climate. But we have seen that
these models have failed the reality test with respect to globally
averaged surface temperature over the past two decades or more. To
compound matters, the performance of climate models relative to reality
worsens as one attempts to project surface temperatures at smaller
geographical scales. 27 Climate models don't do precipitation well More
importantly, the wellbeing of human beings and the rest of nature is
probably more sensitive to changes in precipitation than to temperature,
and precipitation is highly variable from spot to spot. But climate
models perform even worse for precipitation than they do for
temperature, regardless of the geographic scale. In fact, for several
areas many models are unable to reliably hindcast past precipitation,
let alone forecast the future.161,162 Notsurprisingly, precipitation
projections using different models often contradict each other. For
example, a recent study of annual precipitation changes in California
using 25 model projections indicates that '12 projections show drier
annual conditions by the 2060s and 13 show wetter.'163 Thus impact
assessments that use as their starting point the outputs of these
climate models cannot and should not be relied upon to develop policies,
although they may have scientific diagnostic value for improving our
understanding of climate mechanisms and processes. [**Adaptation
methodology is flawed**]{.underline} Failure to properly account for
adaptation **[[Even if]{.underline}]{.mark}** [climate [models
represented]{.mark} reality [perfectly]{.mark}]{.underline} and were
able to foretell the future climate, **[impact [assessments would still
be suspect]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This is [because most]{.mark} global
warming impact assessments [assume]{.mark} little or
[no]{.mark}]{.underline} endogenous (or autonomous)
**[[adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, [the vast majority
of studies of global warming impacts on water resources do not
incorporate any allowance for adaptive measures that might be taken to
**reduce those impacts**]{.underline}, despite the fact that steps of
this nature have been taken since time immemorial.164,165 For instance,
the world's oldest functioning dam, at Lake Homs in Syria, dates back to
1319 BC,166 and qanats, underground canals to convey water for human
settlements and irrigation, were built in Persia as long ago as the
first millennium BC.167 Similarly, of the many studies used by the IPCC
to estimate future impacts on crop yields, 63% did not consider
improvements in the agricultural sector's adaptive capacity.168
Moreover, specific adaptive measures used in many global warming impact
studies are based on surveys of available technologies from the 1990s.
However, today [[suitable]{.mark} adaptation [measures are]{.mark} both
more **[numerous and cheap]{.mark}**]{.underline}er.169 And because we
are wealthier, [these options are even more affordable]{.underline}.170
Consequently, [our [ability to adapt]{.mark} has]{.underline}
**[[improved markedly]{.underline}]{.mark}** [just [in]{.mark} the
[past]{.mark} few [decades]{.mark} or so]{.underline}.171 As proof,
[consider the previously noted global [increases
in]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [crop
[yields]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [access to]{.underline}]{.mark} [safer
[water]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and life expectancy on one
hand]{.underline}, [[and reductions in]{.mark} poverty and [mortality
from]{.mark} vector-borne [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} and extreme
weather events on the other. [These examples [suggest]{.mark} that
[neglecting]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[adaptive capacity]{.underline}**
[and **tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[nological change
can]{.underline}**, [over the course of several decades]{.underline},
[[lead to estimates]{.mark} of impacts that are **[too
pessimistic]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by an **order of
magnitude**]{.underline}]{.mark} or more.172 28 [Another factor that is
ignored]{.underline} in impacts assessments [is the tremendous increase
in our interconnectedness]{.underline} due to the internet, e-mail, text
messages, and cell phones. As a result, [the dissemination of knowledge
is today far faster and wider than what was possible two or three
decades ago]{.underline}. [This increase in connectivity alone
has]{.underline} [**considerably enhanced** humanity's adaptive
capacity]{.underline}.173 [Also ignored is]{.underline} the array of
technologies that are collectively called '[precision
farming]{.underline}': [the growing ability to monitor plant growth,
nutrient deficiencies and the environmental conditions]{.underline} at
finer scales, combined with techniques that use GPS and drones to more
precisely deliver nutrients and water to crops. Today these technologies
can be afforded by wealthy farmers in rich countries. Over time, they
should, like all other technologies, also diffuse around the world as
their costs drop and as rising incomes make them more affordable. Such
techniques should reduce agriculture's demand for water. Because
agriculture is responsible for about 70% of global water consumption,
this ought to free up water for other human uses and substantially
reduce water stress.174 A 20% increase in global agricultural water-use
efficiency should, for example, translate into a global increase of 39%
in water available for nonagricultural use.

### Prez Powers\-\--A2: Turn\-\--Econ

#### Prez powers allow [abusive tariffs]{.underline} that [crush the economy]{.underline}

**Financial Times, 19** \-\-- ("Trump\'s abusive trade powers need
reining in: Congress should pursue plans to curb presidential tariff
discretion,"
<https://www.ft.com/content/2a081212-8dc7-11e9-a24d-b42f641eca37>,
accessed on 7/16/19, ZMS)

Investors exhaled last weekend when Donald Trump pulled back from an
escalatory tariff war with Mexico. But their relief is bound to be
shortlived. **[[When]{.mark}ever [the]{.mark}]{.underline}** US
**[[president finds fault with a]{.mark}nother [country, he
reaches]{.mark} first [for tariffs. His
grievances]{.mark}]{.underline}** need **[[have]{.mark} [nothing to do
with trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**: in Mexico\'s case, Mr Trump was
furious at the persistence of the migrant crisis on the US border.
**[[Nor does he try to link]{.mark} his actions [to statutory
cause]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Mr **[[Trump threatened Mexico under
a]{.mark} 1977 [act that authorises the president to impose penalties on
America\'s enemies, terrorist states]{.mark}]{.underline}** and other
pariahs. **[[Mexico does not resemble any]{.mark} such
[country.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The **[[same applies to]{.underline}]{.mark}** his **[[serial misuse of
section 232, intended to protect the US from strategic
threats,]{.underline}]{.mark}** to impose tariffs on America\'s friends.
**[[Under no]{.mark} sensible [assessment can Canadian metals, or
European cars, be defined as a threat to]{.mark} US national
[security.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Mr Trump shows every sign of
continuing to abuse his powers. It is long overdue for Congress to
reclaim its constitutional role on trade.

To be fair to the normally acquiescent Republicans, Mr Trump\'s party
has led the way in opposing his Mexico belligerence. Normally loyal
senators, such as Ted Cruz of Texas and Iowa\'s Chuck Grassley, attacked
Mr Trump\'s over-reach. Others, including Utah\'s Mike Lee and
Pennsylvania\'s Pat Toomey, are drafting a bill that would limit the
president\'s powers. Such a law is firmly in the US national interest.
For the past 70 years, US presidents have used their leeway to promote
intelligent global trade deals. Only sparingly did they use national
security or emergency powers to curb imports. Even then, their actions
were clearly telegraphed, mostly shortlived and widely debated.

Mr Trump has put a torch to that tradition. Even on China, which comes
closest among his targets to posing a national security threat, Mr Trump
has traduced his powers in both directions. More than once he has hinted
he would lift the ban on Huawei, the China telecoms company, in exchange
for concessions from Beijing. **[[Either an entity poses a]{.mark}
security [threat or it does not.]{.mark} Huawei arguably does. European
aluminium imports do not. Mr [Trump makes no
distinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The fact that Congress wants to rein him in on free trade grounds is no
small irony. The general rule of US politics has been that Congress is
too sectional to be entrusted with oversight of America\'s larger
commercial interests. The White House was always seen as protrade;
Congress as protectionist. That rule is now turning on its head. Not
only are free-trade Republicans digging in their heels. Democrats are
also taking a larger view of the US national interest. Nancy Pelosi, the
Democratic Speaker, is even willing to pass Mr Trump\'s modestly
renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement. This is in spite of
the fact that the minor changes Mr Trump struck were taken almost word
for word from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Barack Obama
negotiated and most Democrats opposed.

The thrust of the coming legislation is clear. The **[White House would
have to seek [congressional approval for emergency
tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[This would
remove]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a large element of [instability from
the global economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For that reason, Mr Trump
would almost certainly veto the bill --- in which case both houses of
Congress would need a two-thirds majority to override it. The odds
against that are high. But we live in fluid times. Three years ago no
one would have predicted Capitol Hill would be the wiser branch of
government on trade. Such a law would go some way towards rebuilding
faith in America\'s system.

#### Economy [resilient]{.underline} -- their impacts are epistemologically faulty and exaggerated -- durability of macro-economic trends, empirical examples of the policy/economic disconnect, offset uncertainty for households/businesses, and faith in intervening actors

The **[interplay between economics and politics was]{.underline}**
undoubtedly a **[dominant]{.underline}** feature of analyses **[during
2016]{.underline}**. As we know, it was difficult to foresee both
election results and their economic consequences. It was certainly not
strange that economists were unable to predict the Brexit referendum
outcome or Donald Trump's victory, when public opinion polling
organisations and betting firms failed to do so, but lessons might be
learned from the economic assessment impacts they made.
**[[Economists]{.underline}]{.mark}** probably **[tend to
[exaggerate]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[importance
of more general [political phenomena]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While in
the midst of elections that appear historically important, **[[it is
tempting to present alarmist]{.mark} [projections]{.mark}]{.underline}**
about election outcomes **[that seem improbable and/or]{.underline}**
**[unpleasant]{.underline}**. [**[But]{.underline}**
**[once]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the initial [shock]{.mark} effect [has
faded]{.mark}, more [ordinary]{.mark}]{.underline}** economic
**[[data]{.mark} such as]{.underline}** corporate reports and
**[macroeconomic figures]{.underline}** **[[take the upper
hand]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[Psychological effects often exaggerated]{.underline}**

**[One important observation is]{.underline}** that **[[it is difficult
to find any]{.mark} historical [correlation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[between]{.mark} heightened]{.underline}** security [**[policy
tensions]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**[economic
activity]{.underline}**. **[Households and businesses]{.underline}**
**[do not seem]{.underline}**]{.mark} to be **[especially
[sensitive]{.mark} in their consumption or capital]{.underline}**
**[spending]{.underline}** behaviour. This is perhaps because
[**[uncertainty]{.underline}** **[is offset]{.underline}** **[by
investments]{.underline}**]{.mark} in a defence build-up, for example.
Only when the conditions that directly determine profitability and
investments are affected, for example via rising oil prices or poorly
functioning financial markets, will the effects become clear.

**[[Markets]{.mark} also]{.underline}** seem to **[[have]{.mark} a
general [tendency to assume]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the **[economic
[policy makers]{.mark} can actually]{.underline}** **[[behave
rationally]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in crisis
situations,]{.underline}** until this has been disproved.
**[Both]{.underline}** **[[during]{.mark} the US
sub-prime]{.underline}** mortgage **[crisis of]{.underline}**
2007-**[20[08]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and]{.mark} the [euro
zone]{.mark}\'s]{.underline}** **[existential crisis]{.underline}** a
few years later, **[for a rather long time the [market
maintained]{.mark} its [faith]{.mark} that a response would
come]{.underline}**. **[Not [until]{.mark} after a [lengthy]{.mark}
period of [inept actions]{.mark}]{.underline}** by decision makers
**[did these crises become genuinely acute]{.underline}**, with large
secondary effects as a consequence. This **[market \"[patience\"
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** presumably **[[based]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a
long-time [pattern of]{.mark} recurring [bailout
measures]{.mark}]{.underline}** by governments and central banks,
**[which usually benefit risk-taking]{.underline}** at the expense of
caution or speculation that policy responses will not materialise.\\

political steps to manage the competition. [[Drawing on data from **109

[When the]{.underline} global [financial crisis struck]{.underline}
roughly a year ago, [the blogosphere was ablaze with]{.underline} all
sorts of [scary predictions of]{.underline}, and commentary regarding,
[ensuing]{.underline} conflict and [wars \-- a rerun of the Great
Depression leading to world war]{.underline}, as it were. Now, as global
economic news brightens and recovery \-- surprisingly led by China and
emerging markets \-- is the talk of the day, it\'s interesting to look
back over the past year and realize how globalization\'s first truly
[[worldwide recession has had **virtually no impact**]{.mark} whatsoever
[on]{.mark} the [international security]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}landscape. [[No]{.mark}ne of the]{.underline} more than
three-dozen [[ongoing conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} listed by
GlobalSecurity.org [[can be]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[attributed to
the]{.mark} global [recession]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [the last
new entry]{.underline} (civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah
[in]{.underline} the [Palestine)]{.underline} [**predates** the economic
crisis]{.underline} by a year, and three quarters of the chronic
struggles began in the last century. Ditto for the 15 low-intensity
conflicts listed by Wikipedia (where the latest entry is the Mexican
\"drug war\" begun in 2006). Certainly, the Russia-Georgia conflict last
August was specifically timed, but by most accounts the opening ceremony
of the Beijing Olympics was the most important external trigger
(followed by the U.S. presidential campaign) for that sudden spike in an
almost two-decade long struggle between Georgia and its two breakaway
regions. Looking over the various databases, then, we see a most
familiar picture: the usual mix of civil conflicts, insurgencies, and
liberation-themed terrorist movements. [Besides]{.underline} the recent
[Russia-Georgia]{.underline} dust-up, [[the only]{.underline}]{.mark}
two potential [state-on-state [wars]{.mark} (North v. South Korea,
Israel v. Iran) [are]{.mark}]{.underline} both tied to one side
acquiring a nuclear weapon capacity \-- a process [[**wholly unrelated**
to]{.mark} global [economic trends]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [with the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
effectively [tied down by]{.underline} its two ongoing major
interventions (Iraq and
[Afghanistan-]{.underline}bleeding-into-Pakistan), our
[[involvement]{.mark} elsewhere]{.underline} around the planet [[has
been]{.mark} quite **[modest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both leading up to
and following the onset of the economic crisis: e.g., the usual
counter-drug efforts in Latin America, the usual military exercises with
allies across Asia, mixing it up with pirates off Somalia\'s coast).
[[Everywhere]{.mark} else [we find]{.mark} serious [instability
we]{.mark}]{.underline} pretty much **[[let it
burn]{.underline}]{.mark}**, occasionally pressing the Chinese \--
unsuccessfully \-- to do something. Our new Africa Command, for example,
hasn\'t led us to anything beyond advising and training local forces.
So, [[to sum up]{.mark}: No significant uptick in]{.underline} mass
[violence or unrest]{.underline} (remember the smattering of urban riots
last year in places like Greece, Moldova and Latvia?); The usual
frequency maintained in civil conflicts (in all the usual places);
[[**Not a single state-on-state war directly caused** (and no
great-power]{.mark}-on-great-power [crises]{.mark} even
[triggered]{.mark}); No]{.underline} great improvement or [disruption
in]{.underline} great-power [cooperation regarding]{.underline} the
emergence of new [nuclear powers]{.underline} (despite all that
diplomacy); A modest scaling back of international policing efforts by
the system\'s acknowledged Leviathan power (inevitable given the
strain); and No serious efforts by any rising great power to challenge
that Leviathan or supplant its role. (The worst things we can cite are
Moscow\'s occasional deployments of strategic assets to the Western
hemisphere and its weak efforts to outbid the United States on basing
rights in Kyrgyzstan; but the best include China and India stepping up
their aid and investments in Afghanistan and Iraq.) Sure, we\'ve finally
seen global defense spending surpass the previous world record set in
the late 1980s, but even that\'s likely to wane given the stress on
public budgets created by all this unprecedented \"stimulus\" spending.
If anything, the friendly cooperation on such stimulus packaging was the
most notable great-power dynamic caused by the crisis. [Can we
say]{.underline} that [the world has suffered a]{.underline} distinct
[shift to]{.underline} political [radicalism]{.underline} as a result of
the economic crisis? Indeed, [no. The]{.underline} world\'s [major
economies remain]{.underline} governed by [center-left]{.underline} or
center-right political factions that remain decidedly friendly to both
markets and trade. [In the short run, there were]{.underline} attempts
across the board to insulate economies from immediate damage (in effect,
as much [protectionism]{.underline} as allowed under current trade
rules), [but]{.underline} there was [[no]{.mark} great [slide into

**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization [[is
functioning]{.underline}]{.mark} as it was designed to function, and
regional efforts toward free-trade agreements have not slowed. Can we
say [Islamic [radicalism]{.mark}]{.underline} was inflamed by the
economic crisis? If it was, that shift [[was clearly overwhelmed
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the Islamic world\'s growing [[disenchantment
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the brutality displayed by violent extremist
groups such as [[al-Qaida]{.underline}]{.mark}. And looking forward,
austere economic times are just as likely to breed connecting
evangelicalism as disconnecting fundamentalism. At the end of the day,
the economic crisis did not prove to be sufficiently frightening to
provoke major economies into establishing global regulatory schemes,
even as it has sparked a spirited \-- and much needed, as I argued last
week \-- discussion of the continuing viability of the U.S. dollar as
the world\'s primary reserve currency. Naturally, plenty of experts and
pundits have attached great significance to this debate, seeing in it
the beginning of \"economic warfare\" and the like between \"fading\"
America and \"rising\" China. And yet, in a world of globally integrated
production chains and interconnected financial markets, such \"diverging
interests\" hardly constitute signposts for wars up ahead. Frankly, I
don\'t welcome a world in which America\'s fiscal profligacy goes
undisciplined, so bring it on \-- please! Add it all up and it\'s fair
to say that this global financial crisis has proven the great resilience
of America\'s post-World War II international liberal trade order. Do I
expect to read any analyses along those lines in the blogosphere any
time soon? Absolutely not. I [[expect]{.mark} the [**fantastic
fear-mongering** to proceed]{.mark}]{.underline} apace. [[That\'s what
the Internet is for]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### No resources mean no war

**Bennett 2K** \-\-\-- D. Scott and Timothy Nordstrom, Professors of
Political Science (Penn State), "Foreign Policy Substitutability and
Internal Economic Problems in Enduring Rivalries," February, Journal of
Conflict Resolution

In this analysis**[,]{.underline}** **[we focus on using economic
conditions to understand when rivalries are likely to escalate or
end]{.underline}**. Rivalries are an appropriate set of cases to use
when examining substitutability both because leaders in rival states
have clearly substitutable choices and because rivalries are a set of
cases in which externalization is a particularly plausible policy
option.7 In particular, **[when confronted [with domestic problems,
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a rivalry **[[have]{.mark} the clear
[alternatives of escalating]{.mark} the conflict]{.underline}** with the
rival **[[to divert]{.underline}]{.mark}** attention
**[[or]{.mark}]{.underline}** to work to
**[[settle]{.mark}]{.underline}** the rivalry **[[as a means of freeing
up]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[substantial]{.underline}** amount of
**[[resources]{.mark} that can be directed [to]{.mark}ward solving
[internal problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} In the case of the
diversion option, rivals provide logical, believable actors for leaders
to target; the presence of a clear rival may offer unstable elites a
particularly inviting target for hostile statements or actual conflict
as necessary. The public and relevant elites already consider the rival
a threat or else the rivalry would not have continued for an extended
period; the presence of disputed issues also provides a casus belli with
the rival that is always present. Rivals also may provide a target where
the possible costs and risks of externalization are relatively
controlled. If the goal is diversion, leaders willwant to divert
attention without provoking an actual (and expensive)war. Over the
course of many confrontations, rival states may learn to anticipate
response patterns, leading to safer disputes or at least to leaders
believing that they can control the risks of conflict when they initiate
a new confrontation. In sum, rivals provide good targets for
domestically challenged political leaders. This leads to our first
hypothesis, which is as follows: *Hypothesis 1*: Poor economic
conditions lead to diversionary actions against the rival. **[Conflict
[settlement is]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[a distinct route]{.mark}
to dealing with internal problems that leaders in rivalries may pursue
[when faced with]{.mark} internal [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Military [competition]{.mark}]{.underline}** between states
**[[requires]{.mark} large amounts of [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
and rivals require even more attention. **[Leaders may choose to
negotiate a settlement that ends a rivalry to free up important
resources]{.underline}** that may be reallocated to the domestic
economy. **[[In]{.mark} a "guns versus butter" world of economic
[trade-offs, when a state can no longer]{.mark} afford to [pay]{.mark}
the expenses associated with competition in a rivalry, [it is]{.mark}
quite [rational]{.mark} for leaders [to]{.mark} reduce costs by
[end]{.mark}ing [a rivalry]{.mark}. This gain]{.underline}** (a peace
dividend) **[could be achieved at any time]{.underline}** by ending a
rivalry. **[However, [such]{.mark} a gain [is likely]{.mark} to be most
important and attractive to leaders [when internal conditions are
bad]{.mark} and the leader is seeking ways to alleviate active problems.
[Support]{.mark} for policy change away from continued rivalry
[is]{.mark} more [likely to develop when]{.mark} the [economic situation
sours]{.mark} and elites and masses are looking for ways to improve a
worsening situation. It is at these times that [the pressure to
cut]{.mark} military investment [will be grea]{.mark}test and that state
leaders will be forced to recognize the difficulty of continuing to pay
for a rivalry]{.underline}**. Among other things, this argument also
encompasses the view that the cold war ended because the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics could no longer compete economically with the United
States. *Hypothesis 2*: **[Poor economic conditions increase the
probability of rivalry termination.]{.underline}** Hypotheses 1 and 2
posit opposite behaviors in response to a single cause (internal
economic problems). As such, they demand a research design that can
account for substitutability between them.

#### Governments buffer damages, safety nets work, and empirics prove

**Zakaria 9** (Fareed, Ph.D. in Political Science -- Harvard University
and Editor -- Newsweek International, "The Secrets of Stability",
Newsweek, 12-21, Lexis)

One year ago, the world seemed as if it might be coming apart. The
global financial system, which had fueled a great expansion of
capitalism and trade across the world, was crumbling. All the
certainties of the age of -globalization\--about the virtues of free
markets, trade, and technology\--were being called into question. Faith
in the American model had collapsed. The financial industry had
crumbled. Once-roaring emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil
were sinking. Worldwide trade was shrinking to a degree not seen since
the 1930s. Pundits whose bearishness had been vindicated predicted we
were doomed to a long, painful bust, with cascading failures in sector
after sector, country after country. In a widely cited essay that
appeared in The Atlantic this May, Simon Johnson, former chief economist
of the International Monetary Fund, wrote: \"The conventional wisdom
among the elite is still that the current slump \'cannot be as bad as
the Great Depression.\' This view is wrong. What we face now could, in
fact, be worse than the Great Depression.\" Others predicted that these
economic shocks would lead to political instability and violence in the
worst-hit countries. At his confirmation hearing in February, the new
U.S. director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, cautioned the
Senate that \"the financial crisis and global recession are likely to
produce a wave of economic crises in emerging-market nations over the
next year.\" Hillary Clinton endorsed this grim view. And she was hardly
alone. Foreign Policy ran a cover story predicting serious unrest in
several emerging markets. Of one thing everyone was sure: nothing would
ever be the same again. Not the financial industry, not capitalism, not
globalization. One year later, how much has the world really changed?
Well, Wall Street is home to two fewer investment banks (three, if you
count Merrill Lynch). Some regional banks have gone bust. There was some
turmoil in Moldova and (entirely unrelated to the financial crisis) in
Iran. Severe problems remain, like high unemployment in the West, and we
face new problems caused by responses to the crisis\--soaring debt and
fears of inflation. But [overall, things look nothing like they did in
the]{.underline} 19[**30s**. The [predictions of economic]{.mark} and
political [collapse have **not materialized**]{.mark} at all. A key
measure]{.underline} of fear and fragility [is the ability of
poor]{.underline} and unstable [countries to borrow money]{.underline}
on the debt markets. [So consider this: the]{.underline} sovereign
[bonds of]{.underline} tottering [Pakistan have returned 168
percent]{.underline} so far [this year]{.underline}. All
[this]{.underline} doesn\'t add up to a recovery yet, but it [does
reflect a return to]{.underline} some level of [normalcy]{.underline}.
And [that rebound has been]{.underline} so [rapid]{.underline} that even
the shrewdest observers remain puzzled. \"The question I have at the
back of my head is \'Is that it?\' \" says Charles Kaye, the co-head of
Warburg Pincus. \"We had this huge crisis, and now we\'re back to
business as usual?\" This revival did not happen because markets managed
to stabilize themselves on their own. Rather, [[governments]{.mark},
having learned the lessons of the Great Depression, were determined not
to repeat the same mistakes]{.underline} once this crisis hit. [By
[massively expanding]{.mark} state [support]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
economy\--[through central banks and national treasuries\--they
[**buffered** the worst]{.mark} of the [damage]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Whether they made new mistakes in the process remains to be seen.) The
[extensive [social safety nets]{.mark}]{.underline} that have been
established across the industrialized world also [[cushioned]{.mark} the
pain]{.underline} felt by many. [Times are]{.underline} still [tough,
but things are nowhere near as bad as in the]{.underline}
19**[30s]{.underline}**, when governments played a tiny role in national
economies. It\'s true that the massive state interventions of the past
year may be fueling some new bubbles: the cheap cash and government
guarantees provided to banks, companies, and consumers have fueled some
irrational exuberance in stock and bond markets. Yet these
[rallies]{.underline} also [demonstrate the return of confidence, and
confidence is a very powerful economic force]{.underline}. When John
Maynard Keynes described his own prescriptions for economic growth, he
believed government action could provide only a temporary fix until the
real motor of the economy started cranking again\--the animal spirits of
investors, consumers, and companies seeking risk and profit. Beyond all
this, though, I believe [there\'s a fundamental reason why we have not
faced global collapse in the last year. It is the same reason that [we
weathered the]{.mark} stock-market [crash of]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[**[87]{.mark}**, the [recession of]{.mark}]{.underline}
19[**[92]{.mark}**, the [Asian crisis]{.mark} of]{.underline} 19[**97**,
the [Russian default]{.mark} of]{.underline} 19[**98**, [and]{.mark} the
[tech-bubble collapse]{.mark} of]{.underline} 20[**00**.
[The]{.mark}]{.underline} current [[global economic system is
**inherently**]{.mark} **more [resilient]{.mark}** than we think. The
world today is [characterized by]{.mark}]{.underline} three [[major
forces for stability]{.mark}, each [reinforcing the
other]{.mark}]{.underline} and each historical in nature.

#### 2008 crushes their impact

**Drezner, 12** (Professor International Politics Tufts University, '12
(Daniel, October, "The Irony of Global Economic Governance: The System
Worked" Council on Foreign Relations International Institutions and
Global Governance)

In looking at outcomes, **[the obvious question is [how well the]{.mark}
global [economy]{.mark} has recovered from the 20[08]{.mark}
crisis]{.underline}**. The current literature on economic downturns
suggests two factors that impose significant barriers to a strong
recovery from the Great Recession: **[it was triggered by a financial
crisis and it was global in scope]{.underline}**. Whether measuring
output, per capita income, or employment, **[financial crashes trigger
downturns that last longer]{.underline}** and have far weaker recoveries
than standard business cycle downturns.10 Furthermore, **[the global
nature of the crisis makes it extremely difficult for countries to
export their way out of the problem]{.underline}**. Countries that have
experienced severe banking crises since World War II have usually done
so when the global economy was largely unaffected. That was not the case
for the Great Recession. **[The global economy has rebounded much better
than during the Great Depression]{.underline}**. Economists Barry
Eichengreen and Kevin O'Rourke have compiled data to compare global
economic performance from the start of the crises (see Figures 1 and
2).11 Two facts stand out in their comparisons. First, **[the percentage
drop in global industrial output and world trade levels at the start of
the 2008 financial crisis was more precipitous than the falloffs
following the October 1929 stock market crash]{.underline}**. The drop
in industrial output was greater in 2008 nine months into the crisis
than it was eighty years earlier after the same amount of time. The drop
in trade flows was more than twice as large. Second, the post-2008
rebound has been far more robust. Four years after the onset of the
Great Recession, **[global industrial output is 10 percent higher than
when the recession began]{.underline}**. In contrast, **[four years
after the 1929 stock market crash, industrial output was at only
two-thirds of precrisis levels.]{.underline}** A similar story can be
told with aggregate economic growth. According to World Bank figures,
**[global economic output rebounded in 2010 with 2.3 percent
growth]{.underline}**, followed up in 2011 with 4.2 percent growth. The
global growth rate in 2011 was 44 percent higher than the average of the
previous decade. Even more intriguing, the growth continued to be
poverty reducing.12 The World Bank's latest figures suggest that despite
the 2008 financial crisis, extreme poverty continued to decline across
all the major regions of the globe. And the developing world achieved
its first Millennium Development Goal of halving the 1990 levels of
extreme poverty.13 An important reason for the quick return to positive
economic growth is that **[cross-border flows did not dry up after the
2008 crisis]{.underline}**. Again, compared to the Great Depression,
**[trade flows have rebounded extremely well]{.underline}**.14 Four
years after the 1929 stock market crash, trade flows were off by 25
percent compared to precrisis levels. Current trade flows, in contrast,
are more than 5 percent higher than in 2008. Even compared to other
postwar recessions, the current period has seen robust crossborder
exchange. Indeed, as a report from CFR's Maurice R. Greenberg Center for
Geoeconomic Studies concluded in May 2012, "**[The [growth]{.mark} in
world trade [since]{.mark} the start of [the]{.mark} \[current\]
[recovery]{.mark} [exceeds]{.mark} [even the best]{.mark} of the
[prior]{.mark} postwar [experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}**."15 Other
cross-border flows have also rebounded from 2008--2009 lows. Global
foreign direct investment (FDI) has returned to robust levels. FDI
inflows rose by 17 percent in 2011 alone. This put annual FDI levels at
\$1.5 trillion, surpassing the three-year precrisis average, though
still approximately 25 percent below the 2007 peak. More generally,
global foreign investment assets reached \$96 trillion, a 5 percent
increase from precrisis highs. Remittances from migrant workers have
become an increasingly important revenue stream to the developing
world---and the 2008 financial crisis did not dampen that income stream.
Cross-border remittances to developing countries quickly rebounded to
precrisis levels and then rose to an estimated all-time high of \$372
billion in 2011, with growth rates in 2011 that exceeded those in 2010.
Total cross-border remittances were more than \$501 billion last year,
and are estimated to reach \$615 billion by 2014.16 Another salient
outcome is mass public attitudes about the global economy. **[[A general
assumption]{.underline}]{.mark}** in public opinion research **[is that
[during a downturn]{.mark}, demand for greater economic closure should
spike, as [individuals scapegoat foreigners]{.mark} for domestic
woes]{.underline}**. **[The global nature of the 2008 crisis, combined
with anxiety about the shifting distribution of power, should have
triggered a fall in support for an open global economy]{.underline}**.
Somewhat surprisingly, **[[however]{.mark}, the reverse is
true]{.underline}**. Pew's Global Attitudes Project has surveyed a wide
spectrum of countries since 2002, asking people about their opinions on
both international trade and the free market more generally.17 **[The
[results show]{.mark} [resilient support]{.mark} [for]{.mark} expanding
[trade]{.mark} and business ties with other countries]{.underline}**.
Twenty-four countries were surveyed both in 2007 and at least one year
after 2008, including a majority of the G20 economies. Overall, eighteen
of those twenty-four countries showed equal or greater support for trade
in 2009 than two years earlier. By 2011, twenty of twenty-four countries
showed greater or equal support for trade compared to 2007. Indeed,
between 2007 and 2012, the unweighted average support for more trade in
these countries increased from 78.5 percent to 83.6 percent. Contrary to
expectation, there has been no mass public rejection of the open global
economy. Indeed, public support for the open trading system has
strengthened, despite softening public support for free-market economics
more generally.18 **[The final outcome addresses]{.underline}** a dog
that hasn't barked: **[[the effect of]{.mark} the Great [Recession
on]{.mark} crossborder [conflict]{.mark} and violence]{.underline}**.
During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple **[analysts asserted
that the financial crisis would lead states to increase their use of
force as a tool for staying in power]{.underline}**.19 **[Whether
through greater internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a
ratcheting up of great power conflict, there were genuine concerns that
the global economic downturn would lead to an increase in
conflict.]{.underline}** Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in
the South China Sea, and even the disruptions of the Occupy movement
fuel impressions of surge in global public disorder. **[[The aggregate
data suggests otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however. A fundamental
conclusion from a recent report by the Institute for Economics and Peace
is that "**[the average level of [peacefulness in]{.mark} 20[12]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} approximately [the same]{.mark} [as]{.mark} it was in
20[07]{.mark}."]{.underline}**20 **[Interstate [violence]{.mark} in
particular has [declined]{.mark} [since the]{.mark} start of the
[financial crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**---as have military expenditures
in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm that **[the Great
[Recession]{.mark} [has not triggered]{.mark} any increase in [violent
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the secular decline in violence that
started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed.21

imposed]{.underline}**. In contrast, **[other presidents have
held]{.underline}** to the view **[that the executive power is not

granted]{.underline}**. President Roosevelt\'s successor, William Howard
**[[Taft]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[was a famous proponent of this more

it, **[that the President can exercise no power which cannot be fairly

#### Constitutional violations are a side constraint -- even within a utilitarian framework

**Levinson 00** (Daryl, Professor of law -- University of Virginia, UC
Law Review, Spring, Lexis)

Extending a majority rule analysis of optimal deterrence to
constitutional torts requires some explanation, for we do not usually
think of violations of constitutional rights in terms of cost-benefit
analysis and efficiency. Quite the opposite, [[constitutional rights
are]{.underline}]{.mark} most commonly conceived as [[deontological
side-constraints that trump even utility-maximizing]{.mark} government
[action]{.mark}]{.underline}. Alternatively, [constitutional rights
might be understood as serving rule-utilitarian purposes]{.underline}.
If the disutility to victims of constitutional violations often exceeds
the social benefits derived from the rights-violating activity, or if
rights violations create long-term costs that outweigh short-term social
benefits, then [constitutional rights]{.underline} can be justified as
tending to [maximize global utility]{.underline}, even though this
requires local utility-decreasing steps. [[Both]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the [deontological and rule-utilitarian descriptions imply]{.mark} that
[the optimal level of constitutional violations is
zero]{.mark}]{.underline}; that is, society would be better off, by
whatever measure, if constitutional rights were never violated.

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Constitution\-\--A2: No Impact

[[Other misfortunes may be]{.mark} borne, or their effects
[overcome]{.mark}. If disastrous war should sweep our
commerce]{.underline} from the ocean, another generation may renew it;
if it exhaust our treasury, [future industry may replenish
it]{.underline}; if it desolate and lay waste our fields, still under a
new cultivation, they will grow green again, and ripen to future
harvests. [It were but a trifle even if the walls of yonder Capitol were

individual security, and public prosperity? No, [[if these columns fall,
they will be raised not again]{.underline}]{.mark}. Like the Coliseum
and the Parthenon, they will be destined to a mournful, a melancholy
immortality. Bitterer tears, however, will flow over them, than were
ever shed over the remnants of a more glorious edifice than Greece or
Rome ever saw, the edifice of constitutional American liberty. [[It is
possible]{.mark} that a constitutional convention could take place and
[no]{.mark}ne of these [drastic consequences would come to pass. It is
possible to play Russian roulette]{.mark} and emerge without a

odds of being shot are only one in six. [But [when the stakes

I just want to say --- I have only got about 40 seconds left.

I want to ask each of you in brief, I mean, **[[is
it]{.underline}]{.mark}** fair to say it\'s **[[good or bad for]{.mark}
our [democracy that presidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- our presidents
**[[have more power]{.mark},]{.underline}** or is --- you just have to
take a case-by-case basis**[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Doug Brinkley?

Douglas Brinkley:

I think you have to go case by case, but this is an overreach that
Donald Trump\'s doing, in my opinion, because it\'s --- he\'s
circumventing, doing an end-run round around both the Constitution and
Congress.

But we will see. He has a conservative Supreme Court. And it might go
--- if it gets there, it might end up being a 5-4 decision in his favor.

Judy Woodruff:

Andrew Rudalevige, what about that?

Andrew **[Rudalevige:]{.underline}**

[**[It\'s bad when Congress gives power away thoughtlessly.
Congress]{.underline}** **[has its own authority]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[under the Constitution]{.underline}**. [**[It should use
it]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

So, **[[if it hands it over]{.mark} to the president [without
thinking]{.mark} about it, [that\'s bad]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If it
thinks about it, if there\'s a case where it\'s relevant and useful,
then I\'m OK with that.

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Demo\-\--A2: DPT Wrong

#### Studies prove that liberal democracy solves both international and civil peace.

**Danilovic and Clare 7** (Vesna and Joe, associate professor of
political science at the University at Buffalo and visiting assistant
professor of political science at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, American Journal of Political Science, April,
InterScience Online)

In our study, we addressed theoretical and empirical gaps in the Kantian
tradition in international relations. Our focus was on domestic sources
of conflict in Kant\'s theory, and we showed that, **[although democracy
is consistent with Kantian thinking, [the most essential
elements]{.mark} of his \"republic\" concern [the protection of civil
liberties]{.mark}, the separation of powers, [and]{.mark} the [rule of
law]{.mark} as barriers to arbitrary rul]{.underline}**e. Our
interpretation of Kant\'s republicanism is in agreement with Kantian
political theorists (e.g., Ellis 2005; Rosen 1993), yet liberal
governance has routinely been subordinated to electoral democracy in the
democratic peace studies. The distinction we draw between procedural
democratic rule and liberal governance is relevant both theoretically
and empirically. Once we unpack Kant\'s republic in terms of
constitutional liberal governance, **[we can uncover several levels of
his reasoning behind the domestic sources for peace which were largely
obscured in the previous studies. Not only do we find that monadic and
dyadic views are consistent with Kant\'s theory, but also that both
normative and interest-based explanations for international peace can
equally draw on Kant as their theoretical precursor]{.underline}**. We
further demonstrate that, if we are to fully understand all constitutive
elements of his republicanism, **[we can additionally infer that the
Kantian legacy is related to a liberal civil peace as
well.]{.underline}** Though one of our primary goals was to provide a
theoretical contribution to the Kantian tradition in international
relations, we also examined its empirical validation. The results of our
empirical analysis strongly support all hypotheses inferred from our
reexamination of Kantian legacy. While the results are mixed for the
\"democratic peace\"---international and domestic alike---**[[the
findings are robust and consistent with our]{.mark} theoretical
[expectations]{.mark} [concerning the impact of constitutional
liberalism]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [both international and civil]{.mark}
\"liberal [peace]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** The compelling evidence in
this study validates Doyle\'s (2005) recent response to the critics of
democratic peace, especially those questioning its historical validity
(e.g., Farber and Gowa 1995; Rosato 2003), that the verdict is still out
as previous empirical studies have not incorporated \"the principles of
liberal individualism\"---the heart of Kant\'s republic. As Doyle points
out, while these might \"evolve\" with \"democratic institutions,\"\"we
cannot be sure of this\" (2005, 466), and thus the theory needs
additional testing that separately codes a liberal component. We
precisely provide such an analysis, casting doubt on the critics\'
rejection of liberal peace on the grounds of empirical invalidity,
though our analytical aim extends well beyond this empirical task.
Finally, **[our study is particularly relevant today. In the last
\"wave\" of democratization, [many states]{.mark} that are [commonly
categorized as democracies]{.mark} [continue to have questionable
records]{.mark}]{.underline}** concerning the protection of individual
freedoms, civil rights, and the rule of law against arbitrary rulings or
policy implementations. Indeed, as our descriptive analysis indicates,
**[there is a substantial group of states that fit into the category of
[semiliberal]{.mark} democracies]{.underline}**. As comparative politics
scholars point out, these are not transitional regimes, but rather
consolidated systems that elude previous classifications, which
typically conflate the liberal and democratic regime dimensions. Like
comparativists, but from a very different---that is, Kantian---angle, we
also caution against conflating liberal democracies and \"hybrid
regimes.\" At the same time, we have gone a step further to show the
implications of analyses for conflict behavior. **[Our empirical
[analysis]{.mark} [validates]{.mark} the [caution]{.mark}
[against]{.mark} quick conclusions about the [peaceful prospects for
these new regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As demonstrated in our study,
**[[if]{.mark} the spread of [democracy]{.mark} [is]{.mark} indeed
[going to lead to]{.mark} international and domestic [peace]{.mark}, [it
must be]{.mark} simultaneous with the full [development
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** what was at the heart of Kant\'s
republicanism, that is, **[constitutional [liberal
governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Democracy Peace Theory real -- empirics, norms, constraints

International Affairs, "Why the United States Should Spread Democracy",
3-1998,
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/why-united-states-should-spread-democracy//RSS>

1\. **[The [Evidence for]{.mark} the [Democratic
Peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Many [studies]{.mark} have [found]{.mark} that there are virtually
n[o historical cases of democracies going to war with one
another]{.mark}. In an important two-part article published in 1983,
Michael Doyle compares all international wars between 1816 and 1980 and
a list of liberal states.53 [Doyle concludes that \"constitutionally
secure liberal states have yet to engage in war with one
another.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**54 Subsequent statistical studies have
found that **[this [absence of war between democracies is statistically
significant]{.mark} and is not the result of random
chance]{.underline}**.55 **[Other analyses have concluded that the
influence of other variables, including geographical proximity and
wealth, do not detract from the significance of the finding that
democracies rarely, if ever, go to war with one
another]{.underline}**.56

Most studies of the democratic-peace proposition have argued that
democracies only enjoy a state of peace with other democracies; they are
just as likely as other states to go to war with nondemocracies.57 There
are, however, **[several [scholars]{.mark} who [argue]{.mark} that
[democracies are inherently less likely to go to war]{.mark} than other
types of states.]{.underline}**58 The evidence for this claim remains in
dispute, however, so it would be premature to claim that spreading
democracy will do more than to enlarge the democratic zone of peace.

2\. **[Why there is a Democratic Peace]{.underline}**: The Causal Logic

Two types of explanations have been offered for the absence of wars
between democracies. The first argues that shared norms prevent
democracies from fighting one another. The second claims that
institutional (or structural) constraints make it difficult or
impossible for a democracy to wage war on another democracy.

a\. Normative Explanations

**[The normative explanation of the democratic peace argues that norms
that democracies share preclude wars between democracies]{.underline}**.
One version of this argument contends that **[[liberal states do not
fight other liberal states because to do so would be to violate the
principles of liberalism. Liberal]{.mark} states only [wage war when it
advances]{.mark} the [liberal]{.mark} [ends]{.mark} of increased
individual freedom. [A liberal state cannot advance liberal ends by
fighting another liberal state]{.mark}, because that state already
upholds the principles of liberalism. In other words, democracies do not
fight because liberal ideology provides no justification for wars
between liberal democracies.59 A second version of the normative
explanation claims that [democracies share a norm of peaceful conflict
resolution]{.mark}. This norm applies between and within democratic
states. Democracies resolve their domestic conflicts without violence,
and they expect that other democracies will resolve inter-democratic
international disputes peacefully.60]{.underline}**

b\. Institutional/Structural Explanations

Institutional/structural explanations for the democratic peace contend
that democratic decision-making procedures and institutional constraints
prevent democracies from waging war on one another. At the most general
level, **[[democratic leaders]{.mark} are constrained by the public,
which is sometimes pacific and [generally slow to mobilize for
war]{.mark}. In most democracies, the legislative and executive branches
check the war-making power of each other. These [constraints may prevent
democracies from launching wars]{.mark}. When [two democracies]{.mark}
confront one another internationally, they are not likely to rush into
war. Their leaders [will]{.mark} have more time to [resolve disputes
peacefully]{.mark}]{.underline}**.61 A different sort of institutional
argument suggests that democratic processes and freedom of speech make
democracies better at avoiding myths and misperceptions that cause
wars.62

c\. Combining Normative and Structural Explanations

Some studies have attempted to test the relative power of the normative
and institutional/structural explanations of the democratic peace.63 It
might make more sense, however, to specify how the two work in
combination or separately under different conditions. For example,
**[[in]{.mark} liberal [democracies liberal norms and democratic
processes]{.mark} probably [work in tandem to]{.mark} synergistically
[produce]{.mark} the [democratic peace.]{.mark}64 Liberal states are
unlikely to even contemplate war with one another. They thus will have
few crises and wars.]{.underline}** In illiberal or semiliberal
democracies, norms play a lesser role and crises are more likely, but
democratic institutions and processes may still make wars between
illiberal democracies rare. Finally, **[state-level factors like [norms
and domestic structures]{.mark} may [interact with
international-systemic factors to prevent wars]{.mark} between
democracies. If democracies are better at information-processing, they
may be better than nondemocracies at recognizing international
situations where war would be foolish. Thus the logic of the democratic
peace may explain why democracies sometimes behave according to realist
(systemic) predictions.]{.underline}**

C. The Spread of Democracy is Good for the United States

The United States will have an interest in promoting democracy because
further democratization enhances the lives of citizens of other
countries and contributes to a more peaceful international system. To
the extent that Americans care about citizens of other countries and
international peace, they will see benefits from the continued spread of
democracy. Spreading democracy also will directly advance the national
interests of the United States, because democracies will not launch wars
or terrorist attacks against the United States, will not produce
refugees seeking asylum in the United States, and will tend to ally with
the United States.

1\. Democracies Will Not Go to War with the United States

First, **[democracies will not go to war against the United States,
provided, of course, that the United States remains a
democracy]{.underline}**. The logic of the democratic peace suggests
that the **[United States will have fewer enemies in a world of more
democracies]{.underline}**. If democracies virtually never go to war
with one another, no democracy will wage war against the United States.
Democracies are unlikely to get into crises or militarized disputes with
the United States. **[[Promoting democracy may usher in a more peaceful
world; it also will enhance the national security of the United States
by eliminating potential military threats.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
United States would be more secure if Russia, China, and at least some
countries in the Arab and Islamic worlds became stable democracies.

#### Global democracy is declining

[[It has become accepted]{.mark}, among most experts on democracy, and
among policymakers, [that democracy]{.mark} worldwide [is in]{.mark}
increasing [peril]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This year's Freedom in the
World]{.mark} annual [report]{.mark} on the state of democracy, produced
by Freedom House (for whom I have consulted on reports on Southeast
Asian states) [noted]{.mark} that [democracy had declined]{.mark}
globally [for thirteen years]{.mark} in a row.]{.underline} It further
[found
that](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat)
authoritarian states were "shed\[ding\] the thin façade of democratic
practice that they established in previous decades," while ["[countries
that democratized after]{.mark} the end of [the Cold War]{.mark} have
[regressed]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [the face of]{.mark} rampant
[corruption]{.mark}, [antiliberal populist movements]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} [breakdowns]{.mark} in the rule [of law]{.mark}" and that
[even]{.mark} consolidated [democracies]{.mark}, [in Europe and North
America]{.mark}, [face]{.mark}d severe [pressure]{.mark}, [backsliding,
and corrosion]{.mark} of democratic institutions and norms.]{.underline}
Its findings have been echoed by a range of other research, and although
autocratic-leaning populists had mixed results in elections in 2018,
they are not going away anytime soon. Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte is likely to consolidate his power in upcoming midterm
elections, and possibly create a dynasty, hoping to eventually hand
power to his daughter. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is
undermining Mexican democratic institutions, going around institutions
via referenda and other means, packing the courts, and taking other
measures, as Shannon O'Neil has noted. Meanwhile, [the most powerful
[authoritarian states]{.mark}, such as China, [are becoming]{.mark} more
repressive, and more [globally influential, while]{.mark} leading
[democracies]{.mark} [are]{.mark} far [less interested in]{.mark}
democracy [promotion outside their borders]{.mark}.]{.underline} With a
few exceptions, like Malaysia and possibly Ethiopia, countries that
recently have seemed ready to shed autocratic governments have backslid,
with repressive regimes crushing political change in places like
Cambodia and Egypt or newly elected leaders failing to support the
growth of democratic institutions, as in Myanmar. Amidst this gloom[, a
fascinating new article, based on groundbreaking new research, suggests
that [the]{.mark} global [retreat of democracy is]{.mark} actually
[worse than]{.mark} it [appears]{.mark}, [even to]{.mark} some of its
most [pessimistic observers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an article for
Democratization, Anna Luhrmann and Staffan Lindberg of the University of
Gothenburg, who base their conclusions on the V-Dem, or Varieties of
Democracy, Project's findings, argue that a "third wave of
autocratization" (following the world's two previous autocratic waves
last century), or [[a]{.mark} [move]{.mark} away [from democracy,
is]{.mark} actually [affecting]{.mark} [more democracies than
was]{.mark} commonly [thought]{.mark}, although [usually through gradual
reversals]{.mark}, with legal facades, rather than an abrupt democratic
reversal like a coup]{.underline}. (I was a contributor to the V-Dem
project briefly.) V-Dem is a project that uses a comprehensive,
multidimensional dataset of various indicators to measure democracy in a
broad range of countries. [[They]{.mark} further [find]{.mark} that this
[backsliding began earlier than]{.mark} [the]{.mark} mid- to
late-[2000s]{.mark}, which is when many democracy experts have traced
the start of the current regression]{.underline}. The authors argue, in
fact, that the current authoritarian resurgence actually began as early
as 1994---a theory that suggests this wave of autocratization is far
longer than previously imagined, and more difficult to stem, although
many of the states regressing today do not revert into as brutal
autocracies as in the past[. Yet b[ecause]{.mark} so much of
[this]{.mark} backsliding [was gradual]{.mark}, and not abrupt,
[it]{.mark} often has [escaped initial notice]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition, these types of gradual regressions, frequently cloaked in
legal shifts and happening while flawed elections continue to take
place---and lacking any Reichstag fire type catalytic event---have made
it harder for domestic opponents of autocratization to mobilize against
the growing repression. [[Even worse]{.mark}, they find that,
[while]{.mark} these gradual processes of [democratic erosion are
not]{.mark} as [abrupt]{.mark} and severe [as]{.mark} reversals like
[coups]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} still [almost always]{.mark} [result in
the death of democracy]{.mark}. Of the democratic erosions they studied,
the note, only 15 percent were halted before democracy broke down---in
Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, South Korea, and tiny Vanuatu. Grim,
indeed.]{.underline}

by]{.mark} **20[50]{.mark}**:]{.underline} all [**super connected** and
**interdependent**. In greater or lesser measure, humans [are]{.mark}
mutually [dependent]{.mark}]{.underline} on each other in the pursuit of
their most salient values, interests, needs, and preferences ---
[[concerns]{.underline} [about]{.underline}]{.mark} personal, community,
and national **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[sustainable]{.underline} economic **[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
protection of [the **[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [equitable
**[distribution]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the globe's material [wealth,
human **[rights]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} even the [validation
of]{.underline} their personal and social [identities]{.underline} by
others. Global [[**warming** is a metaphor]{.mark} of this morphological
social change]{.underline} in the human condition. [**[All]{.mark}**
humans [are **implicated** in]{.mark} this looming]{.underline}
Anthropogenic-induced **[[disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the
exhausts of billions of automobiles, the methane released in fracking
for natural gas, outdated U.S. coal-fired power plants and newly
constructed ones in China. Even the poor farmer burning charcoal to warm
his dinner is complicit.

Since [interdependence surrounds, ensnares, and binds us as a human
society]{.underline}, the dilemma confronting the world's diverse and
divided populations is evident: the [**expanding scope** as well
as]{.underline} the [**[deepening]{.mark}**, **accumulating**, and
**thickening** [interdependencies]{.mark} of globalization [urge global
government.]{.mark}]{.underline} [But]{.underline} the Kantian ideal of
universal governance is beyond the reach of the world's disparate
peoples. [They are **profoundly divided** by religion, culture,
language, tribal, ethnic and national loyalties as well as]{.underline}
by [class, social status, race, gender, and sexual orientation. How have
the]{.underline} [democracies responded]{.underline} to this dilemma?
How have they attempted to reconcile the growing interdependence of the
world's disputing peoples and need for global governance?

What do we mean by the governance of a human society?

[A working, **[legitimate government]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a human
society [[requires]{.mark} simultaneous responses to three]{.underline}
competing [imperatives: [Order, Welfare]{.mark}, and
[Legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the forms of these OWL
imperatives have differed radically over the course of human societal
evolution, [these]{.underline} constraints [remain predicable of all
human societies if they are to replicate]{.underline} themselves [and
flourish over time.]{.underline} The OWL imperatives are no less
applicable to a global society.

1\. [Order]{.underline} refers to a society's investment of awesome
[material power]{.underline} in an individual or body [to arbitrate and
resolve]{.underline} value, interest, and preference [conflicts, which
cannot be otherwise resolved by non-violent means]{.underline} --- the
Hobbesian problematic.

2\. The [Welfare]{.underline} imperative [refers to the
necessity]{.underline} of humans [to eat, drink, clothe, and
shelter]{.underline} themselves and to pursue the full-range of their
seemingly limitless acquisitive appetites. Responses to the Welfare
imperative, like that of Order, constitute a distinct form of governing
power and authority with its own decisional processes and actors
principally associated either with the Welfare or the Order imperative.
Hence we have the Marxian-Adam Smith problematic.

3\. [Legitimacy]{.underline} is no less a form of governing power and
authority, independent of the Order and Welfare imperatives. Either by
choice, socialization, or coerced acquiescence, [populations acknowledge
a regime's governing authority and]{.underline} their [obligation to
submit]{.underline} to its rule. Here arises the Rousseaunian
problematic.

The government of a human society emerges then as an evolving,
precarious balance and compromise of the ceaseless struggle of these
competing OWL power domains for ascendancy of one of these imperatives
over the others. It is against the backdrop of these OWL imperatives ---
Order, Welfare, and Legitimacy --- that we are brought to the democratic
project for global governance.

The Democratic Project

For Order, open societies constructed the global democratic state and,
in alliance, the democratic global-state system. Collectively these
initiatives led to the creation of the United Nations, the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the
European Union to implement the democratic project's system of global
governance.

The democratic global state assumed all of the functions of the
Hobbesian Westphalian security state --- but a lot more. The global
state became a Trading, Banking, Market, and Entrepreneurial state. To
these functions were added those of the Science, Technology and the
Economic Growth state. How else would we be able to enjoy [the
**[Internet]{.mark}**, **[cell phones]{.mark}** and iPhones, or
**[miracle cures]{.mark}**]{.underline}? These
[[are]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[products of the]{.mark} **iron
triangle** of the [global democratic state]{.mark}]{.underline},
academic and non-profit [research]{.underline} centers, [and
corporations. It is a **myth**]{.underline} that [the
Market]{.underline} System [did]{.underline} all [this **alone**. Fueled
by increasing material wealth, [the democratic]{.mark} global [state was
afforded]{.mark} the means to become [the **Safety Net**]{.mark} state,
[providing **ed**]{.mark}ucation, **[health]{.mark}**, **[social
security]{.mark}**, leisure and recreation]{.underline} for its
population. And as the global state's power expanded across this broad
and enlarging spectrum of functions and roles, the global state was also
constrained by the social compacts of the democracies to be bound by
popular rule. The ironic result of the expansion of the global state's
power and social functions and its obligation to accede to popular will
was a Security state and global state-system that vastly outperformed
its principal authoritarian rivals in the Cold War. So much briefly is
the democratic project's response to the Order imperative.

Now let's look at the democratic project's response to the Welfare
imperative. The democracies institutionalized Adam Smith's vision of a
global Market System. The Market System trucks and barters, Smith's
understanding of what it means to be human. But it does a lot more. The
Market System facilitates and fosters the free movement of people, goods
and services, capital, ideas, values, scientific discoveries, and best
technological practices. Created is a vibrant global civil society
oblivious to state boundaries. What we now experience is De
Tocqueville's Democracy in America on global steroids.

As for the imperative of Legitimacy, the social compacts of the
democracies affirmed Rousseau's conjecture that all humans are free and
therefore equal. Applied to elections each citizen has one vote.
[Democratic [regimes]{.mark}]{.underline} are also obliged to submit to
the rule of law, to conduct free and fair elections, to honor majority
rule while protecting minority rights, and to [**[promote]{.mark}**
human [rights]{.mark}]{.underline} at home and
[**[abroad]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The Authoritarian Threat to the Democratic Project

[The **democratic project** for **global [governance]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} now [at **risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Let's start with the
challenges posed by authoritarian regimes, with Russia and China in the
lead. Both [[Russia and China would]{.mark} **[rest global
governance]{.mark}** on Big Power spheres of influence.
Both]{.underline} would [[assume]{.underline} **[hegemonic
status]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in their]{.underline} respective
[regions, [asserting their]{.mark}]{.underline} [versions of the
**[Monroe Doctrine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Their [regional hegemony
would]{.underline} then **[leverage]{.underline}** [their claim to be
global **Big Powers**.]{.underline} Moscow and Beijing would then have
an equal say with the United States and the West in sharing and shaping
global governance. [[The]{.mark} Russo-Chinese global
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} of Order [[would
ascribe]{.underline}]{.mark} to Russia and China governing privileges
not accorded to the states both aspire to dominate. [[Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} would enjoy [**[unconditional]{.mark}**
recognition of]{.underline} their state
**[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}**, territorial integrity, and
non-interference in their domestic affairs, [but]{.underline} [[they
would]{.underline}]{.mark} reserve to themselves the right to
[**[intervene]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the domestic and foreign affairs
of the [states]{.underline} and peoples under their tutelage [in pursuit
of]{.underline} their [hegemonic interests.]{.underline} President
[Putin]{.underline} has [announced]{.underline} that [[Russia's
**imperialism** encompasses]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[millions]{.underline}** of Russians [living in
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[former]{.underline} republics of the
[Soviet [Union]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia contends that Ukraine and
Belarus also fall under Moscow's purported claim to historical
sovereignty over these states. [Forceful re-absorption of **Crimea** and
control over eastern **Ukraine**]{.underline} [are viewed
by]{.underline} President [Putin as Russia's historical
inheritances.]{.underline} Self-determination is not extended to these
states or to other states and peoples of the former Soviet Union. Moscow
rejects their right to freely align, say, with the European Union or,
god forbid, with NATO.

In contrast to the democratic project, universal in its reach, [the
[Russo-Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} conception of a stable [global
[order rests]{.mark} [on]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[[tenuous]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [**[conflict-prone]{.mark}**
**[ethno-national foundations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Russia's
proclaimed enemies are the United States and the European Union. Any
means that undermines the unity of these entities is viewed by Moscow as
a gain. [[The endgame]{.mark} is [a **poly-anarchical**]{.mark}
interstate system,]{.underline} potentially [[as]{.mark} [**war-prone**
as]{.mark} the Eurocentric system [**before**]{.mark} and **after [World
War I]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark}]{.underline} now [populated by states
[with **nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Global politics becomes]{.mark} a **[zero-sum]{.mark}
game**.]{.underline}

[Moscow has **no compunctions** about
**[corrupting]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [**[electoral
processes]{.mark}** of democratic states, conducting
[threaten]{.mark}ing **[military]{.mark}
[exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline} along NATO's east border, or
[[violating]{.mark} the]{.underline} more than 30-year old [[treaty to
ban]{.underline}]{.mark} the deployment of [Intermediate-Range
[**missile launchers**,]{.mark} capable of [**firing nuclear weapons**.
Nothing less than]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**dissolution** of the
democratic project is Moscow's]{.mark} solution for global
[Order.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} also [seeks]{.underline} a
[revision]{.underline} of the global Order. [It [declares sovereignty
over]{.mark} the **[S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea**.
Rejected is The Hague Tribunal's dismissal]{.underline} of this claim.
[Beijing continues to build artificial islands]{.underline} as military
bases in the region [to assert]{.underline} its [control]{.underline}
over these troubled waters. If it could have its way, China would decide
which states and their naval vessels, notably those of the United
States, would have access to the South China Sea.

Where Moscow and Beijing depart sharply are in their contrasting
responses to the Welfare imperative. [Moscow has **no solution** other
than to use]{.underline} its [oil and gas resources]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} instruments of **[coercive diplomacy]{.underline}** and
[to]{.underline} weaken or **[dismantle]{.underline}** existing [Western
**alliances** and international economic **institutions**.]{.underline}
China can ill-afford the dismantling of the global market system. In his
address to the Davos gathering in January of this year, Chinese
President Xi asserted that "any attempt to cut off the flow of capital,
technologies, products, industries and people between economies, and
channel the waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is
simply not possible." Adam Smith could not have said it better. Both
Moscow and Beijing have been particularly assiduous to legitimate their
regimes. President Putin's case for legitimacy is much broader and
deeper than a pure appeal to Russian nationalism. He stresses the
spiritual and cultural unity of Russianspeaking populations spread
across the states of the post-Soviet space. A central core of that unity
is the Russian Orthodox Church, a key prop of the regime. Reviled is
Western secularism, portrayed as corrupt and decadent, viewed by Putin
as an existential threat to the Russian World. The Chinese regime,
secular and atheistic, can hardly rely on religion to legitimate the
regime. Beijing principally rests its legitimacy on its record of
economic development and nationalism. The regime's success in raising
the economic standards of hundreds of millions of Chinese reinforces its
claim to legitimacy in two ways. On the one hand, the Communist Party
can rightly claim to have raised hundreds of millions of Chinese from
poverty within a generation. On the other hand, the Communist Party
insists that its model of economic growth, what critics scorn as crony
capitalism, is superior to the unfettered, market-driven model of the
West. Hence capitalism with Chinese characteristics is more effective
and legitimate than the Western alternative.

Where [[Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} do
**[converge]{.underline}** is in [fashioning]{.underline} [their
responses to the Legitimacy imperative. They **[repudiate]{.mark}
Western [liberal]{.mark} [democracy]{.mark}**[. Both reject criticisms
of]{.mark}]{.underline} their [human [rights abuses]{.mark} as
interventions]{.underline} into their domestic affairs.
[[Dissidents]{.mark} are harassed, incarcerated, or,]{.underline} in
some instances, [[assassinated]{.underline}]{.mark}. Journalists are
co-opted, selfcensored, silenced, or imprisoned. Social [[media]{.mark}
is [state controlled]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both the [Putin]{.underline}
regime [and the]{.underline} [Chinese]{.underline} [Communist
Party]{.underline} [monopolize]{.underline} the [public narratives
evaluating governmental policy.]{.underline} Transparency and
accountability are hostage to governmental secrecy. Civil society has
few effective avenues to criticize governmental actions. Moscow adds an
ironic twist to these controls in manipulating national elections to
produce an elected authoritarian regime.

[[Whether either]{.mark} of these [authoritarian responses]{.mark} to
the Legitimacy imperative [will survive **remains to be
seen**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Beijing's use of economic performance and
nationalism to underwrite its legitimacy is a double-edged sword. If
economic performance falters, then legitimacy suffers. Whether top-down
nationalism will always control nationalism from the bottom-up is also
problematic. In resting legitimacy on nationalism, dubious historical
claims, and crypto-religious beliefs, Moscow is spared Beijing's
economic performance test. That said, there is room for skepticism that
in the long-run Russians will exchange lower standards of living for
corrupt rule in pursuit of an elusive Russian mission antagonistic to
the West. The implosion of the Soviet Union, due in no small part to its
retarded economic and technological development, suggests that the
patience of the Russian people has limits. Demonstrations in March 2017
against state corruption in 82 Russian cities, led largely by Russian
youth, reveal these limits. They are an ominous omen for the future of
the Putin kleptocracy. Meanwhile, neither Russia nor China offers much
to solve the Legitimacy imperative of global governance.

**[We cannot "make America great again" unless America is
secure]{.underline}** **[both at home and in its global
position]{.underline}**. **[But what does this have to do with
democracy]{.underline}**? During the first decade after the 1991 fall of
the Soviet Union, President George H. W. **[Bush's goal of "a Europe
whole and free" and a wider world largely at peace seemed within
reach.]{.underline}** The deadly threats of the Cold War were gone,
**[and]{.underline}** the **[democratic revolutions that appeared to be
sweeping through eastern Europe and elsewhere created
optimism]{.underline}** as to the continuing progress of a liberal
international order. Now, **[two and a half decades later, that
promising trend is being reversed]{.underline}**. The **[[authoritarian
resurgence]{.mark} in Europe and elsewhere]{.underline}** over the past
decade **[has]{.underline}** **[shaken our confidence that liberal
democracy]{.underline}**, free markets and peaceful borders
**[[will]{.mark} continue to [dominate]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
post--Cold War international order. From our being the "sole superpower"
in the 1990s, **[[U.S.]{.mark} global [influence]{.mark} and effective
power [are]{.mark} now]{.underline}** **[[challenged by China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[weakening of the European Union
and the sharp domestic divisions]{.underline}** revealed by the U.S.
presidential campaign. **[The United States and Europe are threatened by
radical terrorists]{.underline}**, **[challenged by territorially
expansionist autocracies]{.underline}**, and **[targeted by covert
action]{.underline}**, massive disinformation and propaganda offensives.
**[Russia and China, the world's two principal autocratic powers, lead
the way in consolidating their model domestically]{.underline}**,
**[but]{.underline}** also in **[[advocating]{.mark} internationally for
an alternative authoritarian model based on strident nationalism,
[autocratic leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[and repression of
human rights and the rule of law]{.underline}**. Russia, through its
covert intervention in the U.S. election, military actions in Ukraine
and support of right-wing populist forces in Europe, is working to
undermine the system of liberal institutions, laws and behavioral norms
that have bound Europe and the United States. Sadly, this alternative
model is gaining ground in Europe and elsewhere. The list includes
formerly promising new democracies such as Hungary, Turkey, Thailand,
the Philippines---and now even Poland. **[What is the connection between
America's security and the state of democracy]{.underline}** in the
world? **[[Democratic countries rarely]{.mark}, if ever, [go to
war]{.mark} with each other or prey on their neighbors]{.underline}**.
**[[Democratic systems]{.mark} and free markets]{.underline}**
**[[support each other]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[sustain individual and group freedoms.]{.underline}** Also, **[the
[rule of law]{.mark}, which subsumes all, [is best guaranteed]{.mark} by
democratic systems]{.underline}**. **[Protection of the democratic
order, now under challenge, must]{.underline}** therefore **[be one of
the priorities]{.underline}** weighed in our strategic decisionmaking
analysis and policy process. And democracy promotion via a revised,
realistic and targeted approach must remain a fundamental
national-security objective for the United States and its allies. At a
recent conference at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars in Washington, DC on this subject, **[eleven experts of varying
political and operational perspectives all concluded that the
national-[security interests]{.mark} of the United States and its allies
not only permit, but [require, America to support
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** abroad. **[[Not to do so would ignore
an existential threat]{.mark} to democracies]{.underline}**, **[and to
the international order]{.underline}** **[that has allowed the United
States to remain secure and prosper.]{.underline}** The new
administration will need a democracy-promotion strategy. We suggest a
triage approach, which will concentrate on three categories of countries
where external support is most likely to succeed. Excluded from these
efforts will be countries like Russia and Uzbekistan, where the effort
would be futile and/or discredit democracy promotion by validating
regime propaganda that equates these programs with aggressive intrusion
into domestic affairs. The most promising cases are found in countries
where autocratic regimes have recently fallen or have agreed to a
negotiated transition (e.g., Tunisia, Ukraine, Myanmar and Indonesia) or
where semi-autocratic governments are visibly weak and opposed by
broad-based indigenous movements (Venezuela). The second group is made
up of countries undergoing democratic regression resulting from the
aggressive nature and partial success of the authoritarian
counteroffensive. Existing democracies such as Poland and Hungary must
be helped from falling backwards. Emerging democracies such as Ukraine,
Moldova and Georgia need assistance in fending off foreign attempts to
subvert them. The third group is comprised of nondemocratic countries
that fall in between regimes transitioning to democracy and consolidated
dictatorships. This category includes autocratic countries such as
Armenia, Thailand and Belarus, where the regimes have retained some
democratic trappings such as controlled elections to maintain a degree
of popular legitimacy. These openings may be used to lay the groundwork
for democratic transition through carefully calibrated democracy
promotion programs. Understandably, much of the focus of the new U.S.
administration will be on countering terrorist threats and dampening the
appeal of radical ideology to susceptible young people. Yet, **[we must
pay attention to prospects for democratic transition]{.underline}** and
meet the authoritarian counteroffensive. At the same time, **[Americans
must reaffirm their own democratic commitments and standards as they
manage their economic divisions]{.underline}** and challenges. **[[If
democracy is to]{.mark} continue to [flourish, nothing is more important
than]{.mark} being true to [American values]{.mark} and principles and
[protecting them globally]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Demo\-\--A2: No War

#### [Democracy]{.underline} solves WMD conflict

Senior Vice President of the Center for American Progress,
"Unconventional Wisdom -- Democracy is Still Worth Fighting For",
Foreign Policy, January / February,
<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/02/unconventional_wisdom?page=0,11>)

**[As the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[struggles to wind down two wars and recover
from a humbling financial crisis, realism is enjoying a
renaissance.]{.underline}** Afghanistan and Iraq bear scant resemblance
to the democracies we were promised. The Treasury is broke. And America
has a president, Barack Obama, who once compared his foreign-policy
philosophy to the realism of theologian Reinhold Niebuhr: \"There\'s
serious evil in the world, and hardship and pain,\" Obama said during
his 2008 campaign. \"And we should be humble and modest in our belief we
can eliminate those things.\" But one can take such words of wisdom to
the extreme-as realists like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
and writer Robert Kaplan sometimes do, arguing that the United States
can\'t afford the risks inherent in supporting democracy and human
rights around the world. Others, such as cultural historian Jacques
Barzun, go even further, saying that America can\'t export democracy at
all, \"because it is not an ideology but a wayward historical
development.\" Taken too far, such realist absolutism can be just as
dangerous, and wrong, as neoconservative hubris. For there is one thing
the neocons get right: As I argue in *The Democracy Advantage*,
**[[democratic governments are more likely]{.mark} than autocratic
regimes [to]{.mark} engage in conduct that advances U.S. interests and
[avoid]{.mark}s situations that pose [a threat to peace and
security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Democratic states are more likely to
[develop and]{.mark} to [avoid famines]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
economic collapse. **[[They are]{.mark} also [less likely to become
failed]{.mark} states [or suffer]{.mark} a]{.underline}** **[[civil
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Democratic states]{.mark} are also more
likely to [cooperate]{.mark} in dealing [with]{.mark} security issues,
such as [terror]{.mark}ism [and prolif]{.mark}eration of
w]{.underline}**eapons of **[m]{.underline}**ass
**[d]{.underline}**estruction. As the bloody aftermath of the Iraq
invasion painfully shows, **[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}** cannot be
imposed from the outside by force or coercion. It **[[must come
from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the people of a **[nation working to get on
the path of democracy and then]{.underline}** **[[adopting]{.mark} the
[policies necessary]{.mark} to remain on that path]{.underline}**. But
we should be careful about overlearning the lessons of Iraq. In fact,
**[[the outside world can make an enormous difference in]{.mark} whether
[such efforts]{.mark} succeed]{.underline}**. **[There are numerous
examples]{.underline}**-starting with Spain and Portugal and spreading
to Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia-in **[which the struggle to
establish democracy]{.underline}** and advance human rights
**[received]{.underline}** **[critical support]{.underline}**
**[from]{.underline}** multilateral bodies, including the United
Nations, as well as from regional organizations, **[democratic
governments]{.underline}**, and private groups. It is very much in
America\'s interest to provide such assistance now to new democracies,
such as Indonesia, Liberia, and Nepal, and to stand with those
advocating democracy in countries such as Belarus, Burma, and China. It
will still be true that the United States will sometimes need to work
with a nondemocratic regime to secure an immediate objective, such as
use of a military base to support the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, or in
the case of Russia, to sign an arms-control treaty. None of that,
however, should come at the expense of speaking out in support of those
struggling for their rights. Nor should we doubt that America would be
more secure if they succeed.

has meanwhile opened his arms of friendship to Russia and China, the
biggest global threats to democracy. His public excuse is the need to
work with Russia on terrorism, and with China on North Korea. That help
has not materialized, which will be a test of Trump's mettle. If he
fails to take action against North Korea, and leaves his many
concessions to China in place, he got played.

**[The North Korean [launches]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[are the
latest]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in decades of [events that show an
animosity of authoritarian rulers toward
democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Shortly after the Soviet Union
disintegrated in the 1990s, **[many U.S. analysts saw democracy and
liberalism as triumphant over autocracy]{.underline}**, and even
presaged the "end of history." Russia and China were proceeding toward
market liberalization and democratization. **[The democratic peace would
soon take hold and the world would evolve in a utopic
manner]{.underline}**, they thought.

**[But]{.underline}** **[that dream now seems far-flung]{.underline}**,
**[with low-grade]{.underline}** Russian and Chinese offensives **[in
Eastern Europe and Asia respectively]{.underline}**. **[These offensives
[are calibrated]{.mark} in such a manner as [to]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[make territorial gains]{.underline}**, **[while not provoking a

relatively [loose]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[alliance based on]{.mark}

and freedom of speech. But the alliance is divided by the strong
democratic desire for peace, and domestic elites with individual
incentives to value trade and investment over the defense of values like
democracy. It is subject to free riding, which President Trump has
successfully pushed, including at an upcoming meeting in Brussels on May
25.

To institutionalize its growing power and leadership of autocratic

global governance not through democratization that might help countries
like Japan, India, Brazil and Germany to positions of greater influence
in places like the U.N. Security Council, but to uniquely reflect and
accommodate China's own growing economic and military power.

#### Democracies prevent war, don't view war as tool of policy, use war as last resort, don't take on as many commitments, don't fight preventative wars, less likely to start crises, more likely to use bargaining strategies,

challenging the dyadic view that joint democracy is a prerequisite for

1\. **[[Democracy Leads to Liberty and Liberty is
Good]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The first way in which the spread of **[democracy enhances the lives of
those who live in democracies is by promoting individual liberty,
including freedom of expression, freedom of conscience, and freedom to
own private property.22 [Respect for]{.mark} the [liberty]{.mark} of
individuals [is an inherent feature of democratic politics.]{.mark} As
Samuel Huntington has written, liberty is \"the peculiar virtue of
democracy.\"]{.underline}**23 A democratic political process based on
electoral competition depends on freedom of expression of political
views and freedom to make electoral choices. Moreover, governments that
are accountable to the public are less likely to deprive their citizens
of human rights. The global spread of democracy is likely to bring
greater individual liberty to more and more people**[. Even imperfect
and illiberal democracies tend to offer more liberty than
autocracies]{.underline}**, and liberal democracies are very likely to
promote liberty. Freedom House\'s 1997 survey of \"Freedom in the
World\" found that **[[79 out of 118 democracies could be classified as
\"free\"]{.mark} and 39 were \"partly free\" and, [of]{.mark} those, 29
qualified as \"high partly free.\" In contrast, only 20 of [the
world\'s]{.mark} 73 [nondemocracies]{.mark} were \"partly free\" and [53
were \"not free]{.mark}.\"24]{.underline}**

The case for the maximum possible amount of individual freedom can be
made on the basis of utilitarian calculations or in terms of natural
rights. **[The utilitarian case for increasing the amount of individual
liberty rests on the belief that increased [liberty will enable more
people to realize their full human potential, which will benefit not
only themselves but all of humankind]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
This view holds that greater **[liberty will allow the human spirit to
flourish, thereby unleashing greater intellectual, artistic, and
productive energies]{.underline}** that will ultimately benefit all of
humankind. **[The [rights-based case]{.mark} for liberty]{.underline}**,
on the other hand, does not focus on the consequences of increased
liberty, but instead **[[argues]{.mark} that [all men and women, by
virtue of their common humanity, have a right to
freedom]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This argument is most memorably
expressed in the American Declaration of Independence: \"We hold these
Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are
endowed by their creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness \...\"

The virtues of greater individual liberty are not self-evident. Various
political ideologies argue against making liberty the paramount goal of
any political system. Some do not deny that individual liberty is an
important goal, but call for limiting it so that other goals may be
achieved. Others place greater emphasis on obligations to the community.
The British Fabian Socialist Sidney Webb, for example, articulated this
view clearly: \"The perfect and fitting development of each individual
is not necessarily the utmost and highest cultivation of his own
personality, but the filling, in the best possible way, of his humble
function in the great social machine.\"25 To debate these issues
thoroughly would require a paper far longer than this one.26 **[The
short response to most critiques of liberty is that there appears to be
a universal demand for liberty among human beings. Particularly as
socioeconomic development elevates societies above subsistence levels,
[individuals desire]{.mark} more [choice and autonomy]{.mark} in their
lives. More important, most [political systems]{.mark} that have been
[founded on principles]{.mark} explicitly [opposed to liberty]{.mark}
have tended to [devolve into tyrannies or]{.mark} to [suffer economic,
political, or social collapse.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

2\. **[[Liberal Democracies are Less Likely to Use Violence Against
Their Own People]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Second, America should spread liberal democracy because the citizens
of liberal democracies are less likely to suffer violent death in civil
unrest or at the hands of their governments.27 These two findings are
supported by many studies, but particularly by the work of R.J. Rummel.
Rummel finds that democracies-by which he means liberal
democracies-between 1900 and 1987 saw only 0.14% of their populations
(on average) die annually in internal violence. The corresponding figure
for authoritarian regimes was 0.59% and for totalitarian regimes
1.48%.28 [Rummel also finds that citizens of liberal democracies are far
less likely to die at the hands of their
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Totalitarian and authoritarian
regimes have been responsible for the overwhelming majority of genocides
and mass murders of civilians in the twentieth century. **[[The states
that have killed millions of their citizens all have been authoritarian
or totalitarian:]{.mark} the Soviet Union, the People\'s Republic of
China, Nazi Germany, Nationalist China, Imperial Japan, and Cambodia
under the Khmer Rouge]{.underline}**. Democracies have virtually never
massacred their own citizens on a large scale, although they have killed
foreign civilians during wartime. The American and British bombing
campaigns against Germany and Japan, U.S. atrocities in Vietnam,
massacres of Filipinos during the guerrilla war that followed U.S.
colonization of the Philippines after 1898, and French killings of
Algerians during the Algerian War are some prominent examples.29

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Demo\-\--A2: Prez Powers Not Key

#### Presidential Powers damage democracy through polarization and creation of the other.

Literature, and English at Vanderbilt University, former professor at
the University of Kentucky, Duke University, the University of
Washington, and Louisiana State University, B.A. from Indiana University

Accessed 03-08-2019)

When the Framers drafted the Constitution in 1787, they aimed to create
a strong executive to replace the weaker leadership structure that the
Articles of Confederation had provided, and to counter state governments
that deliberately devised weak governors. Nevertheless, they denominated
Congress as the "first" and most important branch of government. **[[The
Framers expected that the president would occasionally check]{.mark} the
democratic enthusiasm of [Congress]{.mark} as part of his mission to
uphold the Constitution and execute the law, but they attempted to
ensure that the work of democracy would happen mainly through the
legislative work]{.underline}** of that first branch. They gave us, in
other words, a congressional government.

Yet over time, as experts approvingly concede, **[[the president has
become the main agent within U.S. democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Presidential government replaced congressional government over the
course of the 20th century. This is no simple shift in the
Constitution's architecture --- it's an unbalancing of the Framers'
design and a hard one to stop. **[[The executive office accrues
unprecedented, unconstitutional powers]{.mark} with each new
president.]{.underline}** As individuals, they are hardly to blame. They
are doing their job, faithfully executing the growing powers of the
office.

Because observers mostly like it when the president takes command (he or
she looks like a leader; we feel protected), the ramifications of this
constitutional unbalancing have remained largely unexplored. **[[One
ramification --- polarization --- has]{.mark} long [been a feature
of]{.mark} U.S. [politics, but the increasing powers of the]{.mark}
unitary, unilateralist [president]{.mark} both with regard to national
security and domestic policy [have upped the ante]{.mark}: There's ever
more power at stake.]{.underline}**

**[[The president's increasing supremacy means
that]{.underline}]{.mark}** pundits and intellectuals, party officials
and citizens on both sides of the political divide now proceed as though
**[[politics is war]{.mark} by other means]{.underline}**, when the
reverse used to be a truism. Their effort to destroy the other side's
fighting ability and secure the presidency for their party contributes
to what historian Garry Wills described as the militarization of our
political culture, in which citizens are routinely asked to recognize
the elected president as "our" and not just the military's "commander in
chief," putting routine politics on a wartime basis. It is precisely
this ethos that encourages presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to
rank Republicans alongside Iranians as enemies she is proud to have made
--- and to draw the loudest applause of the evening at the first
Democratic presidential candidate debate in October 2015.

**[[Concluding that those who disagree with you is the enemy is bad for
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[A commitment to democracy means
pledging to the continued negotiation]{.underline}** --- and even the
cultivation --- **[of political disagreement]{.underline}**, which is
irrefutably good for democratic decision-making. Studies repeatedly
confirm that from strong differences of opinion come sounder and more
effective decisions than those made by people in agreement. Disagreement
is not democracy's problem: It is its strength. The big question is what
we do with and about our disagreements.

Democracy is not a winner-take-all game. Quite differently, it's an
ethic demanding that participation is not just for the people whose
views you like but also for ones whose views you despise. The downward
spiral of presidential unilateralism pulls us ever further away from
being able to remember that democratic power is what we the people
delegate to the president, not what he wins for us.

To the extent that we forget, we lose the radical promise of democratic
self-governance that mobilized this nation's revolutionary resistance to
the British monarchy. Instead, we comfort ourselves by electing the king
who makes us feel safest, letting him use the authority of our power for
his increasingly sovereign, secret and unchallengeable aims. **[[By
yielding to polarized unilateralism and]{.mark} taking this comfort[, we
dim the democratic experiment.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Abuses of prez power [kill democracy]{.underline}

Headaches." Harvard Gazette, Harvard Gazette, 20 July 2018,
news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/07/constitutions-wide-latitude-for-a-president-causing-major-legal-headaches/

GAZETTE: Our system of checks and balances has worked largely as planned
for the last 230 years. But now it appears that the
**[[president]{.mark} is [eager to test the limits of executive
power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Because past presidents largely abided by
not just the office's constitutionally mandated boundaries but by
generally accepted norms of conduct, did we perhaps overestimate the
framers' foresight to head off a leader apparently intent on challenging
the idea of co-equal branches of government? If yes, what did they get
wrong, and what could fix it? MARK TUSHNET ('67, WILLIAM NELSON CROMWELL
PROFESSOR OF LAW AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL): The Constitution was designed
to do a reasonably good job of filtering out demagogues and other
"unfit" characters from high office. But the [[Founders
knew]{.underline}]{.mark} that the filtering process would be imperfect
and that [sometimes [people of unfit character could rise]{.mark} to the
top]{.underline}. Their **[[remedy was the separation-of-powers
system]{.mark}, in which the [self-interest of people in each branch
would lead them to oppose overreaching by someone in the others.]{.mark}
They knew of the possibility that political parties would develop, but
they thought their design would discourage them]{.underline}**. (This
was especially true of the design of the Electoral College, which was
expected to generate local and regional "favorite sons," from among whom
the House would pick.) But nationally organized political parties
developed rather quickly after the national Constitution took effect.
Still, for a long while the parties were coalitions of locally based
parties, and cross-party alliances could occur. The novel development,
over the past generation or so, is of highly polarized and internally
unified parties, which leads party members to act in the service of
their party --- to defend an overreaching president of their party, for
example. There are few obvious structural "fixes" for this problem.
Electing the president by national popular majority vote might help, as
might various forms of shifting away from elections in which the winner
is the person with a plurality of the votes (single-transferable voting,
and other devices). But, mostly the remedy lies with political leaders
putting forth programs that will persuade voters that we should abandon
our current polarized positions. MICHAEL KLARMAN (KIRKLAND & ELLIS
PROFESSOR OF LAW AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL): As James Madison famously
explained in the Federalist No. 51, the practical efficacy of [the
Constitution's system of separated powers and checks and balances
depends on the assumption that the government's various institutional
actors will have personal incentives to constrain one another's power
(ambition counteracting ambition, as Madison put it). [That
assumption]{.mark}, however, was [grounded in a political context in
which political parties did not exist]{.mark}.]{.underline} The rapid
development of such parties in the 1790s ensured that the system would
not operate precisely as the Founders had anticipated. Specifically[,
[when the president and the majority of the House and Senate come from
the same political party]{.mark}, those branches of the national
[government]{.mark} are [more likely to act in tandem]{.mark} than in
opposition to one another]{.underline}. That said, throughout American
history, members of Congress hailing from the same party as the
president have proved at least occasionally willing to check executive
authority. Perhaps most famously, many Republicans (though not a
majority on the House Judiciary Committee) supported the impeachment of
Republican President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Today,
by contrast, Republican congressional representatives and senators have
been "utterly supine" (to quote retiring Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake) in
their stance toward President Trump's transgressions of constitutional
rules and norms. [[Three factors]{.mark} explain [why]{.mark} President
[Nixon could have been impeached]{.mark} in 1974, [while President
Trump]{.mark} probably [cannot]{.mark} be today. [First]{.mark},
[Democrats dominated both houses of Congress then]{.mark}, while
[Republicans control both houses today. Second]{.mark}, in the 1970s the
[two major political parties were ideologically diverse]{.mark}.
[Conservative Democrats]{.mark} [and liberal Republicans]{.mark},
plentiful in the early 1970s[, barely exist]{.mark} in Congress
[today]{.mark}. The most conservative congressional Democrat in 2018 is
more liberal than the most liberal Republican. [Third, there was
no]{.mark} analogue in 1974 to [today's Fox News, which has
become]{.mark} essentially a [propaganda arm of the Trump]{.mark}
administration, performing a function [similar]{.mark} [to]{.mark} that
of [gov]{.mark}ernment-[controlled media in increasingly authoritarian
Poland and Hungary]{.mark} --- stating untruths, spinning conspiracy
theories, and diverting attention from the administration's
malfeasances. In 1974, most Americans got their facts --- and they were
facts --- from Walter Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley, or Howard K.
Smith. But facts are increasingly out of fashion today.]{.underline}
According to opinion polls, a majority of Republicans believe (still)
that President Obama was not born in the U.S., that human-caused global
climate change is not real, and that Trump would have won the popular
vote in the 2016 presidential election had it not been for the illegal
ballots cast by 3 to 5 million undocumented immigrants. In the absence
of consensus about basic facts, impeachment is not a realistic
possibility because not enough Republicans will believe any facts
uncovered by Special Counsel Robert Mueller with regard to the Trump
campaign's collusion with Russia or the president's possible obstruction
of that investigation. [[Essentially unchecked by a
Republican-controlled Congress, Trump has proved willing to push the
limits of both constitutional rules and historically grounded norms of
the presidency. The president's]{.mark} continued ownership of the Trump
Organization amounts to an almost [daily violation of the Constitution's
Foreign Emoluments Clause]{.mark}. Trump's successful intimidation of
National Football League team owners to suppress their players' protests
against racial injustice by kneeling during the playing of the national
anthem quite possibly violates the [First Amendment's protection of
freedom of speech.]{.mark} So does Trump's repeated efforts to bully the
postmaster general into raising package-delivery rates for Amazon, which
is a brazen attempt to retaliate against its CEO, Jeff Bezos, for
negative coverage of the administration by The Washington Post, which
Bezos independently owns. A [Congress]{.mark} controlled by Republican
majorities [has done almost nothing to check the president's
transgressive behavior]{.mark}. Instead of defending the special
counsel's investigation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has
blocked a proposed bill to protect Mueller's independence in the face of
Trump's repeated threats to fire him. (McConnell's peculiar logic is
that Mueller doesn't require protection because the president hasn't
tried to fire him yet, though we now know that Trump twice sought to do
precisely that.)]{.underline}

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Demo\-\--New\-\--Disease

#### Democracy key to [improve health]{.underline} and [prevent disease]{.underline} 

**Templin 19** (Tara Templin, Stanford Grad, MAR 13 2019, "Democracy
linked to global health gains in low-, middle-income countries,"
<https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/03/democracy-linked-to-global-health-gains-in-low-middle-income-countries.html>,
MLC)

**[The role of [democracy in public health leads to dramatic decreases
in deaths from noncommunicable diseases, HIV, cardiovascular disease and
transportation injuries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to a new study
by researchers at Stanford and several other institutions. Most studies
that look at whether democracy improves global health rely on
measurements of life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rates. Yet
those measures disproportionately reflect progress on infectious
diseases --- such as malaria, diarrheal illnesses and pneumonia ---
which relies heavily on foreign aid**[. A new study led by [Stanford
Medicine and the Council on Foreign Relations suggests that a better way
to measure the role of democracy in public health is to examine the
causes of adult mortality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as
noncommunicable diseases, HIV, cardiovascular disease and transportation
injuries. Little international assistance targets these noncommunicable
diseases. When the researchers measured improvements in those particular
areas of public health, the results proved dramatic. "The results of
this study suggest that elections and the health of the people are
increasingly inseparable," the authors wrote. A paper describing the
findings were published March 13 in The Lancet. Tara Templin, a graduate
student in health research and policy at Stanford Health Policy, shares
lead authorship with Thomas Bollyky, JD, director of the Global Health
Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. "**[[Democratic
institutions]{.mark} and processes, and particularly free and fair
elections, can be [an important catalyst for improving population
health, with the largest health gains possible for cardiovascular and
other noncommunicable diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}**," the authors
wrote. Templin said the study brings new data to the question of how
governance and health inform global health policy debates, particularly
as global health funding stagnates. "**[As more cases of cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes and cancers occur in low- and middle-income
countries, there [will be a need for greater health care infrastructure
and resources to provide chronic care]{.mark} that weren't as critical
in providing childhood vaccines or acute care,"]{.underline}** Templin
said. Free and fair elections for better health In 2016, the four
mortality causes most ameliorated by democracy --- cardiovascular
disease, tuberculosis, transportation injuries and other noncommunicable
diseases --- were responsible for 25 percent of total death and
disability in people younger than 70 in low- and middle-income
countries. That same year, cardiovascular diseases accounted for 14
million deaths in those countries, 42 percent of which occurred in
individuals younger than 70**[. Over the past 20 years, [the increase in
democratic experience reduced mortality in these countries from
cardiovascular disease, other noncommunicable diseases and tuberculosis
between 8-10 percent, the authors wrote.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "Free
and fair elections appear important for improving adult health and
noncommunicable disease outcomes, most likely by increasing government
accountability and responsiveness," the study said. The researchers used
data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors
Study; V-Dem; and Financing Global Health databases. **[The data cover
170 countries from 1970 to 2015]{.underline}**. **[There is good reason
to believe that the role that democracy plays in child health and
infectious diseases may not be generalizable to the diseases that
disproportionately affect adults.]{.underline}** What Templin and her
co-authors found was democracy was associated with better
noncommunicable disease outcomes. They hypothesize that
**[democracies]{.underline}** may **[give higher priority to health care
investments.]{.underline}** HIV-free life expectancy at age 15, for
example, improved significantly --- on average by 3 percent every 10
years during the study period --- after countries transitioned to
democracy. **[[Democratic experience also explains significant
improvements in mortality from cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis,
transportation injuries, cancers, cirrhosis and other noncommunicable
diseases,]{.mark}]{.underline}** the study said. And yet, this
connection between fair elections and global health is little
understood. "Democratic government has not been a driving force in
global health," the researchers wrote. "Many of the countries that have
had the greatest improvements in life expectancy and child mortality
over the past 15 years are electoral autocracies that achieved their
health successes with the heavy contribution of foreign aid." They note
that Ethiopia, Myanmar, Rwanda and Uganda all extended their life
expectancy by 10 years or more between 1996 and 2016. The governments of
these countries were elected, however, in multiparty elections designed
so the opposition could only lose, making them among the least
democratic nations in the world. Yet these nations were among the top
two-dozen recipients of foreign assistance for health. Only 2 percent of
the total development assistance for health in 2016 was devoted to
noncommunicable diseases, which was the cause of 58 percent of the death
and disability in low-income and middle-income countries that same year,
the researchers found. "Although many bilateral aid agencies emphasize
the importance of democratic governance in their policy statements," the
authors wrote, "most studies of development assistance have found no
correlation between foreign aid and democratic governance and, in some
instance, a negative correlation." Why democracy may improve health
Autocracies such as Cuba and China, known for providing good health care
at low cost, have not always been as successful when their populations'
health needs shifted to treating and preventing noncommunicable
diseases. A 2017 assessment, for example, found that true life
expectancy in China was lower than its expected life expectancy at birth
from 1980 to 2000 and has only improved over the past decade with
increased government health spending. In Cuba, the degree to which its
observed life expectancy has exceeded expectations has decreased, from
four-to-seven years higher than expected in 1970 to three-to-five years
higher than expected in 2016. "There is good reason to believe that the
role that democracy plays in child health and infectious diseases may
not be generalizable to the diseases that disproportionately affect
adults," Bollyky said. Cardiovascular diseases, cancers and other
noncommunicable diseases, according to Bollyky, are largely chronic,
costlier to treat than most infectious diseases, and require more health
care infrastructure and skilled medical personnel. The researchers
hypothesize that democracy improves population health because: When
enforced through regular, free and fair elections, democracies should
have a greater incentive than autocracies to provide health-promoting
resources and services to a larger proportion of the population.
Democracies are more open to feedback from a broader range of interest
groups, more protective of media freedom and might be more willing to
use that feedback to improve their public health programs. Autocracies
reduce political competition and access to information, which might
deter constituent feedback and responsive governance. Various studies
have concluded that democratic rule is better for population health, but
almost all of them have focused on infant and child mortality or life
expectancy at birth. Over the past 20 years, the average country's
increase in democracy reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease by
roughly 10 percent, the authors wrote. [**[They estimate that more than
16 million cardiovascular deaths may have been averted due to an
increase in democracy globally from 1995 to 2015.]{.underline}**
T]{.mark}hey also found improvements in other health burdens in the
countries where democracy has taken hold: an 8.9 percent reduction in
deaths from tuberculosis, a 9.5 percent drop in deaths from
transportation injuries and a 9.1 percent mortality reduction in other
noncommunicable disease, such as congenital heart disease and congenital
birth defects. "This study suggests that democratic governance and its
promotion, along with other government accountability measures, might
further enhance efforts to improve population health," the study said.
"Pretending otherwise is akin to believing that the solution to a
nation's crumbling roads and infrastructure is just a technical
schematic and cheaper materials." Other researchers from the Council on
Foreign Relations, as well as researchers from the University of
Washington-Seattle and Bilkent University in Turkey, also contributed to
the study. Funding for the research came from Bloomberg Philanthropies
and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Stanford's Department of Health
Research and Policy also supported the work.

diseases have been one of the greatest causes of mortality in history.
Unlike many other global challenges pandemics have happened recently, as
we can see where reasonably good data exist. Plotting **[[historic
epidemic fatalities]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a log scale reveals that
these tend to follow a power law with a small exponent: many plagues
have been found to follow a power law with exponent 0.26.261
**[[These]{.mark} kinds of [power laws are
heavy-tailed]{.mark}]{.underline}**262 **[[to a significant
degree]{.mark}.]{.underline}**263 In consequence most of the fatalities
are accounted for by the top few events.264 If this law holds for future
pandemics as well,265 then the majority of people who will die from
epidemics will likely die from the single largest pandemic. Most
epidemic fatalities follow a power law, with some extreme events -- such
as the Black Death and Spanish Flu -- being even more deadly.267 There
are other grounds for suspecting that such **[[a high impact epidemic
will have a greater probability than]{.underline}]{.mark}** usually
**[[assumed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** All the **[features of an extremely
devastating disease]{.underline}** already **[exist in
nature:]{.underline}** essentially incurable (Ebola268), nearly always
**[fatal]{.underline}** (rabies269), extremely
**[infectious]{.underline}** (common cold270), **[and]{.underline}**
long **[incubation periods]{.underline}** (HIV271). **[If a pathogen
were to emerge that]{.underline}** somehow **[combine]{.underline}**d
**[these features (and]{.underline}** influenza has demonstrated
**[antigenic shift]{.underline}**, the ability to combine features from
different viruses272), its death toll would be extreme. Many relevant
features of the world have changed considerably, making past comparisons
problematic. The modern world has better sanitation and medical
research, as well as national and supra-national institutions dedicated
to combating diseases. Private insurers are also interested in modelling
pandemic risks.273 Set against this is the fact that **[[modern]{.mark}
[transport and dense]{.mark} human [population allow infections to
spread]{.mark} much]{.underline}** more rapidly274, and **[[there is the
potential for urban slums to serve as breeding
grounds]{.underline}]{.mark}** for disease.275 Unlike events such as
nuclear wars, pandemics would not damage the world's infrastructure, and
initial survivors would likely be resistant to the infection. And there
would probably be survivors, if only in isolated locations. Hence the
risk of a **[[civilisation collapse would come from the ripple
effect]{.mark} of the fatalities]{.underline}** and the policy
responses. These would include political and agricultural disruption as
well as economic dislocation and damage to the world's trade network
(including the food trade). **[[Extinction risk
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** only **[[possible]{.mark} if the
aftermath]{.underline}** of the epidemic fragments and diminishes human
society to the extent that recovery becomes impossible277 before
humanity succumbs to other risks (such as climate change or further
pandemics).

Historically, **[[disease events]{.mark} [have been responsible for the
greatest death tolls]{.mark} on humanity. The 1918 flu was responsible
for more than 50 million deaths]{.underline}**,1 while **[smallpox
killed perhaps 10 times that many in the 20th century
alone.]{.underline}**2 **[The Black Death was responsible for killing
over 25% of the European population]{.underline}**,3 while **[other
pandemics]{.underline}**, such as the plague of Justinian, **[are
thought to have killed 25 million]{.underline}** in the 6th
century---constituting over 10% of the world's population at the time.4
It is an open question whether **[a [future pandemic could]{.mark}
[result in]{.mark} outright [human extinction]{.mark} or the
irreversible collapse of civilization]{.underline}**.

**[[A skeptic would have]{.underline}]{.mark}** many good **[[reasons to
think]{.mark} that [existential risk]{.mark} from disease [is unlikely.
Such a disease would need to spread worldwide]{.mark} to remote
populations, overcome]{.underline}** rare **[genetic resistances, [and
evade detection]{.mark}]{.underline}**, cures, and countermeasures. Even
evolution itself may work in humanity's favor: **[[Virulence and
transmission is]{.mark} often [a trade-off]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
so evolutionary pressures could push against maximally lethal wild-type
pathogens.5,6

While **[[these arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}** point to a very small
risk of human extinction, **[they [do not rule the possibility
out]{.mark}]{.underline}** entirely. Although rare, **[[there are
recorded instances of species going extinct due to
disease]{.underline}]{.mark}**---primarily in amphibians, but also in 1
mammalian species of rat on Christmas Island.7,8 There **[are also
[historical examples of large human populations being]{.mark} almost
entirely [wiped out]{.mark} by disease, [especially when multiple
diseases were simultaneously introduced]{.mark} into a
population]{.underline}** without immunity. The most striking examples
of total population collapse include native American tribes exposed to
European diseases, such as the Massachusett (86% loss of population),
Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of population), and theWestern Abenaki
(which suffered a staggering 98% loss of population).

In the modern context, no single disease currently exists that combines
the worst-case levels of transmissibility, lethality, resistance to
countermeasures, and global reach. But **[many diseases are proof of
principle that each worst-case attribute can be realized
independently.]{.underline}** For example, **[[some diseases
exhibit]{.mark} nearly a [100%]{.mark} case [fatality]{.mark} ratio in
the absence of treatment]{.underline}**, such as rabies or septicemic
plague**[. [Other diseases have a track record of spreading to]{.mark}
virtually [every]{.mark} human [community
worldwide]{.mark},]{.underline}** such as the 1918 flu,10 and
**[seroprevalence studies indicate that other pathogens,]{.underline}**
such as chickenpox and HSV-1**[, can successfully reach over 95% of a
population]{.underline}**.11,12 **[Under optimal virulence theory,
natural evolution would be an unlikely source for pathogens with the
highest possible levels of transmissibility]{.underline}**, virulence,
and global reach. **[But [advances in biotech]{.mark}nology [might allow
the creation of diseases that combine]{.mark} such
[traits]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Recent controversy has already emerged
over a number of scientific experiments that resulted in viruses with
enhanced transmissibility, lethality, and/or the ability to overcome
therapeutics.13-17 Other experiments demonstrated that mousepox could be
modified to have a 100% case fatality rate and render a vaccine
ineffective.18 In addition to transmissibility and lethality, **[studies
have shown that other disease traits, such as incubation time,
environmental survival, and available vectors, could be
modifie]{.underline}**d as well.19-2

2\. **[Pandemic [diseases threaten humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}**

One possibility is the disgruntled individual who might create or steal
a virus and travel around the world releasing it

**[Natural and engineered pandemic disease is one of the most-studied
global risks. It is an area given new urgency by the controversy over
\"gain of function\" experiments. These involve taking a known pathogen
and adding extra, risky functionality]{.underline}**. For example, **[in
2011, virologists]{.underline}** Ron Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka
**[created a strain of the bird flu virus that could be transmitted
between ferrets]{.underline}**. This was done in order to better
understand the conditions in which the virus might develop
transmitability in the wild. Such experiments can head off certain risks
but create an arguably greater one, in that **[[the modified organism
might escape]{.mark} the lab [and cause a global
pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[The risk]{.mark} here [is]{.mark} particularly [great]{.mark}
because [it is self-replicating]{.mark}. Whereas a nuclear explosion is
localised, [in our highly connected world a synthetic, incurable virus
could spread around the planet in days]{.mark}. In the past, [natural
pandemics]{.mark} such as the black death [have killed millions]{.mark}

We fear **[[it is only a matter of time]{.mark} before]{.underline}**

**[[Pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}** now **[[occur with great]{.mark}er

to funding for U.S.]{.underline}** scientific **[research]{.underline}**
and foreign aid, including funding for the United Nations, **[stand to
[deepen our vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[We
also]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[face]{.mark} the specter of [novel and
mutated pathogens that could spread and kill faster than]{.mark}
diseases we have seen [before]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the advent of
genome-editing technologies, bioterrorists could artificially engineer
new plagues, a threat that Ashton Carter, the former U.S. secretary of
defense, thinks could **[[rival nuclear weapons in
deadliness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The two of us have advised the
president of Guinea on stopping Ebola. In addition, we have worked on
ways to contain the spread of Zika and have informally advised U.S. and
international organizations on the matter. **[Our experiences tell us
that the world is unprepared for these threats]{.underline}**. We
urgently need to change this trajectory. We can start by learning four
lessons from the gaps exposed by the Ebola and Zika pandemics. Faster
Vaccine Development The most effective way to stop pandemics is with
vaccines. However, with Ebola there was no vaccine, and only now, years
later, has one proven effective. This has been the case with Zika, too.
Though there has been rapid progress in developing and getting a vaccine
to market, it is not fast enough, and Zika has already spread worldwide.
Many other diseases do not have vaccines, and developing them takes too
long when a pandemic is already under way. We need faster pipelines,
such as the one that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
is trying to create, to preemptively develop vaccines for diseases
predicted to cause outbreaks in the near future. Point-of-Care
Diagnostics Even with such efforts, vaccines will not be ready for many
diseases and would not even be an option for novel or artificially
engineered pathogens. With no vaccine for Ebola, our next best strategy
was to identify who was infected as quickly as possible and isolate them
before they infected others. Because Ebola's symptoms were identical to
common illnesses like malaria, diagnosis required laboratory testing
that could not be easily scaled. As a result, many patients were only
tested after several days of being contagious and infecting others. Some
were never tested at all, and about 40% of patients in Ebola treatment
centers did not actually have Ebola. Many dangerous pathogens similarly
require laboratory testing that is difficult to scale. Florida, for
example, has not been able to expand testing for Zika, so pregnant women
wait weeks to know if their babies might be affected. What's needed are
point-of-care diagnostics that, like pregnancy tests, can be used by
frontline responders or patients themselves to detect infection right
away, where they live. These tests already exist for many diseases, and
the technology behind them is well-established. However, the process for
their validation is slow and messy. Point-of-care diagnostics for Ebola,
for example, were available but never used because of such bottlenecks.
Greater Global Coordination **[We need stronger global
coordination]{.underline}**. The **[[responsibility]{.mark} for
controlling pandemics [is fragmented,]{.mark} spread across too many
players [with no unifying authority]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In Guinea we
forged a response out of an amalgam of over 30 organizations, each of
which had its own priorities. **[In Ebola's aftermath, there have been
calls for a mechanism for responding to pandemics similar to the advance
planning and training that NATO has in place for its numerous members to
respond to military threats in a quick, coordinated
fashion]{.underline}**. This is the right thinking, but we are far from
seeing it happen. The errors that allowed Ebola to become a crisis
replayed with Zika, and the **[[WHO]{.mark}, which should anchor global
action, continues to [suffer from a lack of
credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Stronger Local Health Systems
**[[International actors]{.mark} are essential but [cannot]{.mark}
parachute into countries and [navigate local dynamics quickly
enough]{.mark} to contain outbreaks]{.underline}**. In Guinea it took
months to establish the ground game needed to stop the pandemic, with
Ebola continuing to spread in the meantime. We need to help developing
countries establish health systems that can provide routine care and,
when needed, coordinate with international responders to contain new
outbreaks. Local health systems could be established for about half of
the \$3.6 billion ultimately spent on creating an Ebola response from
scratch. **[Access to routine care is also essential]{.underline}** for
knowing when an outbreak is taking root and establishing trust. For
months, Ebola spread before anyone knew it was happening, and then
lingered because communities who had never had basic health care doubted
the intentions of foreigners flooding into their villages. The turning
point in the pandemic came when they began to trust what they were
hearing about Ebola and understood what they needed to do to halt its
spread: identify those exposed and safely bury the dead. **[With Ebola
and Zika, we lacked]{.underline}** these four things --- vaccines,
diagnostics, **[global coordination, and local health systems --- which
are still urgently needed]{.underline}**. However, prevailing political
headwinds in **[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**,
which **[has [played a key role in combatting pandemics]{.mark} around
the world]{.underline}**, threaten to make things worse. The Trump
administration is seeking drastic budget cuts in funding for foreign aid
and scientific research. The U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for
International Development may lose over one-third of their budgets,
including half of the funding the U.S. usually provides to the UN. The
National Institutes of Health, which has been on the vanguard of
vaccines and diagnostics research, may also face cuts. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, which has been at the forefront of
responding to outbreaks, remains without a director, and, if the
Affordable Care Act is repealed, would lose \$891 million, 12% of its
overall budget, provided to it for immunization programs, monitoring and
responding to outbreaks, and other public health initiatives.
**[Investing in our ability to prevent and contain pandemics through
revitalized national]{.underline}** and international
**[institutions]{.underline}** **[should be our]{.underline}** shared
**[goal]{.underline}**. However, if U.S. agencies become less able to
respond to pandemics, leading institutions from other nations, such as
Institut Pasteur and the National Institute of Health and Medical
Research in France, the Wellcome Trust and London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine in the UK, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs
have done instrumental research and response work in previous
pandemics), would need to step in to fill the void. There is no border
wall against disease. **[Pandemics are [an existential threat on par
with climate change and nuclear conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We are
at a critical crossroads, where we must either take the steps needed to
prepare for this threat or become even more vulnerable. It is only a
matter of time before we are hit by a deadlier, more contagious
pandemic. Will we be ready?

#### Extinction

**Bar-Yam 16 --** Yaneer Bar-Yam, Founding President of the New England
Complex Systems Institute, "Transition to Extinction: Pandemics in a
Connected World," NECSI (July 3, 2016),
<http://necsi.edu/research/social/pandemics/transition>

Watch as one of the more aggressive---brighter red --- strains rapidly
expands. After a time it goes extinct leaving a black region. Why does
it go extinct? The answer is that it spreads so rapidly that it kills
the hosts around it. Without new hosts to infect it then dies out
itself. **[That the rapidly spreading pathogens die out has important
implications for evolutionary research]{.underline}** which we have
talked about elsewhere \[1--7\].

In the research I want to discuss here, **[what we were interested in is
the effect of adding long range transportation]{.underline}** \[8**[\].
This includes natural means of dispersal as well as unintentional
dispersal by humans, like adding airplane routes, which is being done by
real world airlines]{.underline}** (Figure 2).

**[When we introduce long range transportation into the model, the
success of more [aggressive strains]{.mark} changes. They can use the
long range transportation to [find]{.mark} new [hosts and escape]{.mark}
local extinction.]{.underline}** Figure 3 shows that the more
transportation routes introduced into the model, the more higher
aggressive pathogens are able to survive and spread.

As we add more long range transportation, **[there is a critical point
at which [pathogens become so aggressive]{.mark} that [the entire host
population dies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The pathogens die at the same
time, but that is not exactly a consolation to the hosts**[. We call
this [the]{.mark} phase [transition to extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Figure 4). **[[With increasing]{.mark} levels of [global
transportation]{.mark}, human [civilization may be approaching]{.mark}
such [a critical threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In the paper we wrote in 2006 about the dangers of global transportation
for pathogen evolution and pandemics \[8\], we mentioned the risk from
Ebola. Ebola is a horrendous disease that was present only in isolated
villages in Africa. It was far away from the rest of the world only
because of that isolation. Since Africa was developing, it was only a
matter of time before it reached population centers and airports. While
the model is about evolution, it is really about which pathogens will be
found in a system that is highly connected, and Ebola can spread in a
highly connected world.

The traditional approach to public health uses historical evidence
analyzed statistically to assess the potential impacts of a disease. As
a result, many were surprised by the spread of Ebola through West Africa
in 2014. As the connectivity of the world increases, past experience is
not a good guide to future events.¶ **[A key point about the phase
transition to extinction is its suddenness. Even a system that seems
stable, can be destabilized by a few more long-range connections, and
connectivity is continuing to increase.]{.underline}**

**[So how close are we to the tipping point? We don't know but it would
be good to find out before it happens.¶]{.underline}** While Ebola
ravaged three countries in West Africa, it only resulted in a handful of
cases outside that region. One possible reason is that many of the
airlines that fly to west Africa stopped or reduced flights during the
epidemic \[9\]. In the absence of a clear connection, public health
authorities who downplayed the dangers of the epidemic spreading to the
West might seem to be vindicated.¶ As with the choice of airlines to
stop flying to west Africa, our analysis didn't take into consideration
how people respond to epidemics. It does tell us what the outcome will
be **[unless we respond fast enough and well enough to stop the spread
of future diseases]{.underline}**, which may not be the same as the ones
we saw in the past. **[As the world becomes more connected, the dangers
increase.¶]{.underline}** Are people in western countries safe because
of higher quality health systems? Countries like the U.S. have highly
skewed networks of social interactions with some very highly connected
individuals that can be "superspreaders." The chances of such an
individual becoming infected may be low but events like a mass outbreak
pose a much greater risk if they do happen. **[If a sick food service
worker in an airport infects 100 passengers, or [a contagion
event]{.mark} happens in mass transportation, an outbreak [could]{.mark}
very well [prove unstoppable]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[a]{.mark}**]{.underline}nti**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**iotic-**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**esistant
[bacterial infections. That is more deaths than breast and prostate
cancer]{.underline} combined. While [[MRSA]{.underline}]{.mark}
(methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is the most publicized of
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it [[is]{.mark} just **[one of
many]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, other bacteria that kill thousands
of people each year include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. [These]{.underline} bacteria
[are]{.underline} all resistant to at least some antibiotics, giving
them the name "[**[superbugs]{.mark}**", [and]{.mark} the
[number]{.mark} of infections resistant **even to antibiotics of last
resort** [is increasing]{.mark}. How did this happen? We did it to
ourselves. [Antibiotics are]{.mark} omnipresent]{.underline} in the
Western world, [[overprescribed]{.mark} for patients]{.underline} who
demand them [even when they have viral infections. Then these same
[patients fail]{.mark} to take the prescription to [completion]{.mark},
allowing]{.underline} some [bacteria to survive. As a
result,]{.underline} bacterial [[resistance]{.mark} can
**[develop]{.mark} by [mutations]{.mark}**]{.underline} of genes that
antibiotics target**[, [or]{.mark} even from
[transfer]{.mark}]{.underline}** of antibiotic-resistant genes between
bacteria. [This makes bacterial infections **difficult to treat**.
Resistant bacteria multiply and spread]{.underline}, since they are able
to survive the constant antibiotic onslaught. [When a serious bacterial
infection develops, it]{.underline} is likely that the infection is due
to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which [limits treatment options. This
is especially a problem in [hospitals]{.mark}, which [are **breeding
grounds**]{.mark} **for resistant organisms**]{.underline}. Hospitals
have a large number of susceptible people with compromised immune
systems, making a haven for sick people into a dangerous place.
Similarly, antibiotics are overused on cattle, often using them as
prophylaxis, preventative medicine, on animals that are not sick,
instead of only treating infected animals[. All of these situations
select for the bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. **[We've
reached]{.mark} a [tipping point]{.mark}**. For a while we had many
antibiotics in [our arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline} to treat bacterial
infections, [so even if treatment with one]{.underline} antibiotic
[failed, there were other options. **Unfortunately that [is]{.mark}
often [no longer true]{.mark}**[, with resistance]{.mark} emerging
[faster than]{.mark} new [therapies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem is
that drug companies prefer to make medication for chronic conditions,
such as cancer or heart disease, since their long-term treatment is much
more profitable. In fact, according to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), 21 new drugs have been approved for cancer treatment since the
beginning of last year. In the same time frame, just one new bacterial
treatment has been approved. As a result, [[we are left with]{.mark}
**too few antibiotic options** and patients have to be put on
[antibiotics of last resort]{.mark}.]{.underline} These have worse side
effects and require long-term treatments. And [[even these]{.mark} drugs
sometimes **[fail]{.mark}**. This leaves us unable [to]{.mark} [treat
infections]{.mark} we **once were able to cure**]{.underline}.

On Feb. 21, 2003, a 64-year-old Chinese physician named Dr. Liu Jianlun
traveled to Hong Kong to attend a wedding. He stayed in room 911 on the
ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Liu, who had been treating cases of
a mysterious respiratory disease in the neighboring Chinese province of
Guangdong, was already sick when he arrived in Hong Kong, and the next
day he checked into the city's Kwong Wah hospital. [[Liu]{.mark}
died]{.underline} on Mar. 4 [of]{.underline} the disease doctors soon
named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or [[SARS]{.mark}. But
before]{.underline} he died, he **[[inadvertently
infected]{.underline}]{.mark}** at least [16 people]{.underline} who
spent time on the ninth floor of that Hotel. It's [that chain of
events]{.underline} that [must have been on American officials'
minds]{.underline} last week [when news broke]{.underline} that [the
U.S. had its first case of]{.underline} Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
([[MERS]{.underline}]{.mark}). A male health care provider had been in
Saudi Arabia, the epicenter for the ongoing MERS outbreaks, before
flying to Chicago via London on Apr. 24. After arriving in Chicago, he
took a bus to the Indiana town of Munster, where on Apr. 28 he was
admitted to the hospital and was eventually diagnosed with MERS. [A
deadly respiratory disease that **has already [infected
hundreds]{.mark}**]{.underline}, almost all in Saudi Arabia, [and
killed]{.underline} over [100]{.underline} people had come to the U.S.
CDC officials played down the larger threat of the first U.S. MERS case.
"In this interconnected world we live in, we expected MERS to make its
way to the U.S.," Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on May
2. "We have been preparing for this." CDC officials will contact and
track individuals who might have been close to the patient --- including
health workers who treated him and fellow travelers on his international
flights and his bus ride to Munster --- just in case any developed MERS
symptoms. That's not likely. So far MERS hasn't shown much ability to
spread easily from person to person, so the threat to the larger U.S.
public is probably very small. But if that Indiana case remains isolated
--- and MERS itself never becomes the global health threat that SARS was
--- it only means we were lucky. [As Schuchat put it, [exotic]{.mark},
emerging [diseases are]{.mark} now "**just [a plane's ride
away]{.mark}**."]{.underline} In the past, [before international air
travel]{.underline} became common, emerging [pathogens could begin

diseases are widely cited as having the potential to [pose direct
threats to]{.mark} the [stability]{.mark} and security of
states]{.underline}**: HIV/AIDS and influenza. HIV/AIDS. Since it was
first identified in 1981, HIV is estimated to have killed more than 25
million people worldwide. According to the Joint UN Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), the percentage of the global population with HIV has
stabilized since 2000, but the overall number of people living with HIV
(33 million in 2007) has steadily increased. Sub-Saharan Africa
continues to bear a disproportionate share of the global burden of HIV
with 35 percent of new HIV infections, 75 percent of AIDS deaths, and 67
percent of all people living with HIV. 116 Scholars have identified four
ways that HIV/AIDS can affect security. 117 First, the
disproportionately high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the armed forces of
some nations, particularly in Southern Africa, may compromise the
ability of those states to defend themselves from internal or external
threats. Militaries with high rates of HIV infection may suffer losses
in combat readiness and effectiveness as infected troops are transferred
out of combat roles, units lose cohesion because of high turnover rates,
middle management is \"hollowed out\" by the early death or disability
of officers, and defense budgets are strained because of rising medical
costs and the need to recruit and train replacements for sick soldiers.
The second threat is that HIV/AIDS **[will [undermine]{.mark} the
[international peace-keeping]{.mark} system. Nations with
militaries]{.underline}** with high rates of HIV/AIDS will be **[unable
to provide troops for international peacekeeping missions; nations with
healthy militaries may be unwilling to commit troops to peacekeeping
operations]{.underline}** in nations with a high prevalence rate of
HIV/AIDS; **[and war-torn nations may be unwilling to accept
peacekeepers for fear they will spread the disease in their
country.]{.underline}** The third threat is that a \"second wave\" of
HIV/AIDS could **[[strike]{.mark} large, strategically important
countries such as [China, India, and Russia]{.mark}. These states,
[which possess nuclear weapons and]{.mark} are important players in
critical regions, also [suffer]{.mark} from [internal security
challenges]{.mark} that could be [aggravated by a]{.mark}]{.underline}**
severe AIDS **[[epidemic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its **[attendant
socioeconomic disruptions]{.underline}**. The fourth threat is that the
high prevalence of HIV in less developed countries will cause
**[[political instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[could
degenerate into internal conflict]{.mark} or spread into neighboring
countries]{.underline}**. Unlike most diseases, which affect primarily
the poor, young, and old, HIV/AIDS strikes young adults and members of
the middle and upper classes. By sickening and killing members of
society when they should be their most productive, HIV/AIDS has
inflicted the \"single greatest reversal in human development\" in
modern history. 118

3\. **[[Democracy Enhances Long-Run Economic
Performance]{.underline}]{.mark}**

A third reason for promoting democracy is that **[[democracies tend to
enjoy greater prosperity over long periods of time]{.mark}. As democracy
spreads, more individuals are likely to enjoy greater economic
benefits.]{.underline}** Democracy does not necessarily usher in
prosperity, although some observers claim that \"a close correlation
with prosperity\" is one of the \"overwhelming advantages\" of
democracy.32 Some democracies, including India and the Philippines, have
languished economically, at least until the last few years. Others are
among the most prosperous societies on earth. Nevertheless, **[[over the
long haul democracies generally prosper]{.mark}. As Mancur Olson points
out: \"It is no accident that the countries that have reached the
highest level of economic performance across generations are all stable
democracies.\"]{.underline}**33

**[[Authoritarian regimes often compile impressive short-run economic
records]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For several decades, the **[[Soviet
Union]{.mark}\'s annual growth in gross national product (GNP)
[exceeded]{.mark} that of the [United
States]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} leading Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev to pronounce \"we will bury you.\" **[[China]{.mark} has
[posted double-digit annual GNP]{.mark} increases in recent
years]{.underline}**. But autocratic countries rarely can sustain these
rates of growth for long. As Mancur Olson notes, \"experience shows that
relatively poor countries can grow extraordinarily rapidly when they
have a strong dictator who happens to have unusually good economic
policies, such growth lasts only for the ruling span of one or two
dictators.\"34 **[The [Soviet Union was unable to sustain its rapid
growth]{.mark}; its economic failings ultimately caused the country to
disintegrate in the throes of political and economic turmoil. Most
[experts doubt that China will continue its rapid economic
expansion]{.mark}. Economist Jagdish Bhagwati argues that \"no one can
maintain these growth rates in the long term. Sooner or later China will
have to rejoin the human race.\"]{.underline}**35 Some observers predict
that the stresses of high rates of economic growth will cause political
fragmentation in China.36

Why do democracies perform better than autocracies over the long run?
Two reasons are particularly persuasive explanations. First,
**[democracies-especially liberal [democracies-are more likely to have
market economies, and market economies tend to produce economic growth
over the long run.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Most of **[the world\'s
leading economies thus tend to be market economies]{.underline}**,
including the United States, Japan, the \"tiger\" economies of Southeast
Asia, and the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. [T**[wo recent studies suggest that there is a direct
connection between economic liberalization and economic
performance]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[. [Freedom House]{.mark} conducted
a World Survey of Economic Freedom for 1995-96, which evaluated 80
countries that account for 90% of the world\'s population and 99% of the
world\'s wealth on the basis of criteria such as the right to own
property, operate a business, or belong to a trade union. It
[found]{.mark} that the [countries rated \"free\" generated 81% of the
world\'s output even though they had only 17% of the world\'s
population]{.mark}.]{.underline}**37 A second recent study confirms the
connection between economic freedom and economic growth. **[The
[Heritage Foundation]{.mark} has constructed an Index of Economic
Freedom that looks at 10 key areas: trade policy, taxation, government
intervention, monetary policy, capital flows and foreign investment,
banking policy, wage and price controls, property rights, regulation,
and black market activity. It has [found that countries classified as
\"free\" had annual]{.mark} 1980-1993 real per capita Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) (expressed in terms of purchasing power parities) [growth
rates of 2.88%. In \"mostly free\" countries the rate was 0.97%, in
\"mostly not free\" ones -0.32%, and in \"repressed\" countries
-1.44%]{.mark}.]{.underline}**38 Of course, some democracies do not
adopt market economies and some autocracies do, but liberal democracies
generally are more likely to pursue liberal economic policies.

Second, **[[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}** that embrace liberal
principles of government **[are [likely to create a stable
foundation]{.mark} for long-term economic growth. Individuals will only
make long-term investments when they are confident that their
investments will not be expropriated. These and other economic
[decisions require assurances that private property will be
respected]{.mark} and that contracts will be enforced]{.underline}**.
These conditions are likely to be met when an impartial court system
exists and can require individuals to enforce contracts. **[Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has argued that: \"The guiding mechanism
of a free market economy \... is a bill of rights, enforced by an
impartial judiciary.\"39 These conditions also happen to be those that
are necessary to maintain a stable system of free and fair elections and
to uphold liberal principles of individual rights. Mancur Olson thus
points out that \"the [conditions]{.mark} that are [needed to have the
individual rights needed for maximum economic development]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} exactly the same conditions that are [needed to have a
lasting democracy]{.mark}. \... the same court system, independent
judiciary, and respect for law and individual rights that are needed for
a lasting democracy are also required for security of property and
contract rights.\"40 Thus [liberal democracy is the basis for long-term
economic growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The conclusions reached in this thesis demonstrate how **[[economic

into]{.mark} the calculus for [future conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The findings also suggest that **[security issues with economic or
financial underpinnings will transcend classical determinants of war and
conflict, and change the manner by which rival states engage in hostile
acts toward one another]{.underline}**. The research shows that
**[security concerns emanating from [economic uncertainty]{.mark} and
the inherent vulnerabilities within global financial markets [will
present new challenges for national security]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
provide developing [states new asymmetric options for balancing]{.mark}
[against stronger states]{.mark}.]{.underline}**¶ **[The security
areas]{.underline}**, identified in the proceeding chapters, **[are
[likely to mature into global security threats]{.mark} in the immediate
future]{.underline}**. As the case study on South Korea suggest, **[the
overlapping security issues associated with economic decline and reduced
military spending by the United States will affect allied confidence in
America's security guarantees]{.underline}**. The study shows that
**[this outcome could cause regional instability or realignments of
strategic partnerships in the Asia-pacific region with ramifications for
U.S. national security]{.underline}**. **[[Rival states]{.mark} and
non-state groups [may]{.mark} also [become emboldened to challenge
America]{.mark}'s status]{.underline}** in the unipolar international
system.¶ **[The potential risks associated with stolen or [loose
WMD]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[resulting from poor security,
[can]{.mark} also [pose a threat to]{.mark} U.S. national
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The case study on Pakistan, Syria and
North Korea show how **[financial constraints affect weapons security
making weapons vulnerable to theft, and how [financial factors can
influence WMD proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}** by contributing to
the motivating factors behind a trusted insider's decision to sell
weapons technology. The **[inherent [vulnerabilities within]{.mark} the
global financial [markets will provide terrorists']{.mark} organizations
and other non-state groups]{.underline}**, who object to the current
international system or distribution of power, **[with [opportunities

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Demo\-\--New\-\--Econ\-\--A2: Not Key

#### Democracy indispensable in economic success

**Making Africa Work 19** (Making Africa Work, 5/19/17, "Democracy is
key to economic success,"
https://mg.co.za/article/2017-05-19-00-democracy-is-key-to-economic-success)
//MLC

The first reason for supporting democracy in Africa is that the
continent's **[[democracies have]{.mark} typically [posted economic
growth rate]{.mark}s that are one-third [faster than]{.mark} its
[autocracies.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[They
are]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, **[[better equipped]{.mark} [to
create]{.mark} the]{.underline}** numbers of **[[jobs required
as]{.mark} their [populations expand]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
matches what has been seen globally and over a longer time frame. For
example, as the work by the Africa Center's Joseph Siegle and his
colleagues illustrates, since the end of the Cold War, **[only [nine out
of 85 autocracies worldwide have]{.mark}]{.underline}** realised
**[[sustained economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover**[, [48
of these autocracies had]{.mark} at least one episode of [disastrous
economic experience]{.mark} (defined as an annual contraction in per
capita gross domestic product of at least 10%) during this
period.]{.underline}** There is a link between democratic and economic
performance in this regard. **[Of [the top 47 countries in the United
Nation's human development index --- that is, those classified as having
"very high human development" --- 41 are deemed as
"free";]{.mark}]{.underline}** two (Singapore and Seychelles) as "partly
free'; and just four (Brunei, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and
Qatar) as "not free". Analysis by Nicolas van de Walle and Takaaki
Masaki substantiates further the link between democracy and growth. In
scrutinising 43 (out of 49) countries in sub-Saharan Africa for the
period 1982 to 2012, the **[authors found "strong evidence that
democracy is positively associated with economic growth", and that this
"democratic advantage"]{.underline}** is more pronounced for those
African countries that have been democratic for longer periods of time.
A calculation on the basis of the Freedom House classifications shows
that GDP growth in those **[[countries classified as "free" is
substantially higher than growth in the "partly" and "not free"
categories]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As can be seen, **[the performance of
the "not free" group is considerably worse]{.underline}** if the
oil-producing states (Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Gabon and the
Democratic Republic of Congo) are omitted. Although, in the short term,
commodity endowments can push up growth rates, over the medium to long
term, the quality of governance becomes more important because commodity
prices are cyclical and good governance is necessary to garner
investment. **[[Not only do democratic regimes improve]{.mark}
accountability [but also the great asset of democracy is that it enables
a test of philosophies in the marketplace of the political
consumer]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[One of the inherent strengths of
democratic systems is their flexibility and
pragmatism.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[They enable consensus --- that aid
is no longer a panacea, that regional integration needs to be promoted,
that investing in education and skills is essential --- to be
implemented and institutions to work. [Democracy makes politics and
policies more competitive, something particularly lacking under
autocratic regimes]{.mark} and, to be successful, businesses and
economies need a competitive edge. T[hus, a "benevolent dictatorship"
comes with a cost to potential economic growth.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As we get closer to the centenary of Gavrilo Princip's act of terrorism
in Sarajevo, there is an ever more vivid fear: **[[it could happen
again]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The approach of **[[the]{.mark} hundredth
[anniversary of 1914]{.mark} has [put a]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[spotlight on]{.mark} the [fragility of the
world's]{.mark}]{.underline}** political and **[[economic]{.mark}
security [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the beginning of 2013,
Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker was widely ridiculed for
evoking the shades of 1913. By now he is looking like a prophet. By
2014, as **[the security situation in the South China Sea
deteriorated]{.underline}**, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cast
China as the equivalent to Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany; and the **[fighting
in Ukraine and in Iraq is a sharp reminder of the dangers of
escalation]{.underline}**. Lessons of 1914 are about more than simply
the dangers of national and sectarian animosities. **[[The main
story]{.mark} of today as then [is the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[precariousness of]{.mark} financial
[globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and the consequences that
political leaders draw from it. In the influential view of Norman Angell
in his 1910 book The Great Illusion, **[the interdependency of the
increasingly complex global economy made war impossible.
But]{.underline}** **[a quite opposite conclusion was possible and
equally plausible]{.underline}** -- **[and]{.underline}** **[proved to
be the case]{.underline}**. **[Given the extent of fragility, a clever
twist to the control levers might make war easily winnable by the
economic hegemon]{.underline}**. [**[In the wake of an]{.underline}**
**[epochal]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[financial [crisis]{.mark} that
almost brought a complete global collapse,]{.underline}** **[in
1907]{.underline}**, **[several [countries started to think of finance
as]{.mark} primarily [an instrument of]{.mark} raw
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, one that could and should be turned to
national advantage. The 1907 panic emanated from the United States but
affected the rest of the world and demonstrated the fragility of the
whole international financial order. The aftermath of the 1907 crash
drove the then hegemonic power -- Great Britain - to reflect on how it
could use its financial power. Between 1905 and 1908, the British
Admiralty evolved the broad outlines of a plan for financial and
economic warfare that would wreck the financial system of its major
European rival, Germany, and destroy its fighting capacity. Britain used
its extensive networks to gather information about opponents. London
banks financed most of the world's trade. Lloyds provided insurance for
the shipping not just of Britain, but of the world. Financial networks
provided the information that allowed the British government to find the
sensitive strategic vulnerabilities of the opposing alliance. What
pre-1914 Britain did anticipated the private-public partnership that
today links technology giants such as Google, Apple or Verizon to U.S.
intelligence gathering. Since last year, the Edward Snowden leaks about
the NSA have shed a light on the way that global networks are used as a
source of intelligence and power. For Britain's rivals, the financial
panic of 1907 showed the necessity of mobilizing financial powers
themselves. The United States realized that it needed a central bank
analogous to the Bank of England. American financiers thought that New
York needed to develop its own commercial trading system that could
handle bills of exchange in the same way as the London market. Some of
**[[the dynamics of]{.mark} the pre-[1914]{.mark} financial world
[are]{.mark} now [re-emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Then an
economically declining power, Britain, wanted to use finance as a
weapon]{.underline}** against its larger and faster growing competitors,
Germany and the United States. **[Now [America is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in turn **[[obsessed by]{.mark} being overtaken by
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- according to some calculations, set to
become the world's largest economy in 2014. **[In the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis, [financial institutions
appear]{.mark}]{.underline}** both **[as [dangerous]{.mark} weapons of
mass destruction]{.underline}**, but also as potential instruments for
the application of national power. In managing the 2008 crisis, the
dependence of foreign banks on U.S. dollar funding constituted a major
weakness, and required the provision of large swap lines by the Federal
Reserve. The United States provided that support to some countries, but
not others, on the basis of an explicitly political logic, as Eswar
Prasad demonstrates in his new book on the "Dollar Trap." Geo-politics
is intruding into banking practice elsewhere. Before the Ukraine crisis,
Russian banks were trying to acquire assets in Central and Eastern
Europe. European and U.S. banks are playing a much reduced role in Asian
trade finance. Chinese banks are being pushed to expand their role in
global commerce. After the financial crisis, China started to build up
the renminbi as a major international currency. Russia and China have
just proposed to create a new credit rating agency to avoid what they
regard as the political bias of the existing (American-based) agencies.
The next stage in this logic is to think about how financial power can
be directed to national advantage in the case of a diplomatic tussle.
Sanctions are a routine (and not terribly successful) part of the
pressure applied to rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. But
financial pressure can be much more powerfully applied to countries that
are deeply embedded in the world economy. The test is in the Western
imposition of sanctions after the Russian annexation of Crimea.
President Vladimir Putin's calculation in response is that the European
Union and the United States cannot possibly be serious about the
financial war. It would turn into a boomerang: Russia would be less
affected than the more developed and complex financial markets of Europe
and America. **[The [threat of]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[systemic
disruption]{.underline}** **[generates]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a new
sort of [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}**, one **[that mirrors the
decisive feature of the crisis of the summer of 1914]{.underline}**.
**[At that time, no one could really know whether clashes would escalate
or not]{.underline}**. That feature contrasts remarkably with almost the
entirety of the Cold War, especially since the 1960s, when **[the
strategic doctrine of [M]{.mark}utually [A]{.mark}ssured
[D]{.mark}estruction]{.underline}** **[[left no doubt]{.mark} that
[any]{.mark} superpower [conflict would]{.mark} inevitably
[escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The idea of network disruption relies
on the ability to achieve advantage by surprise, and to win at no or low
cost. But it is inevitably a gamble, and raises prospect that others
might, but also might not be able to, mount the same sort of operation.
Just as in 1914, **[there is an enhanced temptation to roll the
dice]{.underline}**, **[even though [the game may be
fatal]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[We are]{.underline}** now
**[witnessing the]{.underline}** **[frightening political
manifestation]{.underline}** **[of economic stagnation]{.underline}**.

The first event was the fourth quarter GDP release for the United
States. Gross Domestic Product---the broadest measure of economic
production---only grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the last
quarter of 2015. In the past year, GDP has only grown 1.8 percent, down
from 2.1 percent since the end of the recession in 2009. And this is
lower than the historical growth rate of 3 percent. Furthermore, since
2008, the U.S. economy has been producing less than its potential,
averaging \$652 billion per year, costing every American over \$16,000
in lost income.

The second event was a radical policy change from the Bank of Japan, who
lowered interest rates to -0.1 percent on central bank deposits to
stimulate lending and growth. In other words, the Bank of Japan now
charges banks to hold their money, making it the fourth economy after
the Eurozone, Denmark, and Sweden to dip below the zero lower bound. The
logic is that banks will pass on interest rate savings to consumers and
businesses in the form of cheaper loans.

The United States, the Eurozone, and Japan---three of the world's four
largest economies---have engaged in unprecedented monetary stimulus
since 2008 by slashing interest rates, and flooding their economies with
credit. And yet growth in each of these economies is anemic. Why hasn't
the multi-trillion dollar monetary stimulus boosted growth?

The answer is that the current stagnation needs both monetary stimulus,
which has mainly boosted the prices of assets disproportionately owned
by the wealthy, and, more importantly, fiscal stimulus. But due to
political opposition from the right, government spending, and thus
economic growth, has been crippled by economic austerity. Austerity is
argued to reduce budget deficits, which will lower interest rates and
inspire business and consumer confidence. But austerity has a
demonstrably weak track record, as the world's largest economies
continue to stagnate even after cuts to government spending.

Without spending on programs that directly create jobs, there will be no
demand for the loans incentivized by central banks. With weak demand and
still-damaged business and consumer balance sheets, flooding the economy
with credit will have minimal effects on growth. What needs to happen to
stimulate a worldwide recovery is increased government spending on a
scale similar to that provided by the world's central banks. Industrial
policy that targets strategic investments such as infrastructure, green
energy, and public transportation can boost growth by directly providing
funds for investment and hiring.

Governments could also guarantee employment to unemployed workers.
Instead of paying workers not to work through unemployment insurance,
governments could directly hire workers in economically and socially
productive sectors. If this sounds infeasible, consider that during the
Great Depression, the U.S. government largely solved the unemployment
problem while improving the country's infrastructure by funding programs
such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress
Administration. In addition, the government became a de facto employer
of last resort during World War II, lowering unemployment under 2
percent and generating massive growth, not only during the war, but in
subsequent years as well. By lowering unemployment and increasing
incomes, fiscal policy could generate massive increases in spending and
growth.

Governments could also costlessly change laws that would boost growth,
such as making it easier for workers to unionize. Higher union
membership would increase wages, allowing for greater consumption and
growth. Currently, 1 out of every 8 workers belong to a union, and most
of these are concentrated in the public sector. But in the 1950s and
1960s, 1 out of every 3 workers belonged to a union. During this period,
economic growth exceeded 4 percent, compared to the 2.6 percent growth
since 1980.

But why do politicians continue to insist on more austerity and
anti-worker policies? These policies would tilt the balance of power
from the wealthy to workers. And since the wealthy dominate the campaign
finance landscape, essentially buying politicians to implement their
will, politicians will only support policies that will increase their
chances of receiving more money and getting re-elected.

Although pro-wealthy policies increase capital gains, dividends, and
profits in the short-term, they ultimately destroy broad-based
purchasing power, which will lower growth for everyone else in the
long-term. The elite are only concerned with their own gains and their
wealth under business- and finance-friendly policies would be greater
than otherwise.

This **[greed]{.underline}** has **[set the stage for a]{.underline}**
**[protracted period]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}**
**[[below-normal growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** and secular stagnation.
**[Such [policies are inimical to]{.mark} not only a sustainable

A key question in economics today is: Does technological advancement,
and the improvement in average people's material conditions that it
creates, continue upward at a steady rate? Or has it already peaked?
It's no small question. **[If we have learned anything, it is that

#### Economic decline causes global nuclear war

Institute Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace Program, Uppsala University,
2015, "Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International
Area Studies Review, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311

Several **[recent works]{.underline}** on China and Sino--US relations
**[have made]{.underline}** substantial **[contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline}** a
combination of **[nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}**. At least
four conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who
say that **[interdependence may both inhibit and drive
conflict]{.underline}** are right. **[[Interdependence raises the cost
of conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** for all sides **[but]{.underline}**
**[asymmetrical or unbalanced dependencies and [negative trade
expectations]{.mark}]{.underline}** may **[generate tensions leading to
trade wars among inter-dependent states that]{.underline}** in turn
**[[increase]{.mark} the risk of [military
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach,
2014). The risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is
governed by an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015);
second, the risk of war between China and the US should not just be
analysed bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party
countries could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this
context it is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in
Northeast Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated
economically through production networks within a global system of trade
and finance (Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth,
**[decisions for war]{.underline}** and peace **[are taken by very few
people, who act on the basis of their future
expectations]{.underline}**. International relations theory must be
supplemented by foreign policy analysis in order to assess the value
attributed by national decision-makers to economic development and their
assessments of risks and opportunities. **[[If
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}** on either side of the Atlantic **[begin
to seriously fear or [anticipate]{.mark} their own nation's
[decline]{.mark}]{.underline}** then **[[they]{.mark} may
[blame]{.mark}]{.underline}** this on **[[external dependence]{.mark},
appeal to anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the use of force to
gain]{.underline}** respect or **[credibility, adopt protectionist
policies, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** ultimately **[[refuse to be
deterred by]{.underline}]{.mark}** either **[[nuclear arms]{.mark} or
prospects of socioeconomic calamities. Such a dangerous [shift could
happen abruptly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, i.e. under the instigation of
actions by a third party -- or against a third party.

Yet as long as there is both nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the
tensions **[in East Asia]{.underline}** are unlikely to escalate to war.
As Chan (2013) says, all states in the region are aware that they cannot
count on support from either China or the US if they make provocative
moves. **[[The greatest risk is]{.mark} not]{.underline}** that **[a
territorial dispute]{.underline}** leads to war under present
circumstances **[but that [changes in the world economy]{.mark} alter
those circumstances in ways that render inter-state peace more
precarious]{.underline}**. If China and the US fail to rebalance their
financial and trading relations (Roach, 2014) then a trade war could
result, interrupting transnational production networks, provoking social
distress, and exacerbating nationalist emotions. **[This could have
unforeseen consequences in the field of security, [with nuclear
deterrence]{.mark} remaining [the only factor to protect]{.mark} the
world [from Armageddon]{.mark}, and unreliably so]{.underline}**.
**[[Deterrence could lose]{.mark} its
[credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**: one of the two **[[great powers
might gamble]{.mark} that the other yield in a cyber-war or
conventional]{.underline}** limited **[war]{.underline}**, or third
party countries might engage in conflict with each other, with a view to
obliging Washington or Beijing to intervene.

CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we applied arguments about substitutability to the
problem of how economic conditions influence state behavior in
international rivalries. We first developed a general argument about how
substitutability might be handled theoretically and statistically and
then explored how states respond to internal economic problems by
substituting between diversionary behavior and seeking rivalry
termination. **[[After conducting]{.underline}]{.mark}** a multinomial
logit **[[analysis, we found significant support for the application of
the diversionary conflict]{.mark} hypothesis within rivalries; we found
that states experiencing [slower rates of growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in their per capita GDP **[[appear to be more likely to initiate a
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** against a rival than do states with
higher growth rates. We also found no support for the Blainey targeting
hypothesis; rivals initiated with higher probability against states
without economic problems (consistent with the strategic application of
diversionary conflict theory). We also found that **[[diversionary
conflict was a more likely reaction to internal problems than was
rivalry termination]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[rivalry termination
actually appeared most likely in the context of good economic
conditions]{.underline}** within the rivals. **[[The relatively larger
support for externalization in our analysis compared to previous studies
may have been revealed by our more sophisticated
model]{.mark},]{.underline}** which allows for the possibility of
another policy choice, namely, rivalry termination; by our focus on
rival states; and by our analysis of economic growth as a precursor to
manifest conflict behavior within states.

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Demo\-\--New\-\--Econ\-\--A2: No War\-\--Clary

#### Clary relies on "rare events regression", which [biases against]{.underline} wars 

**Allison 12** (Paul, Ph.D., is Professor of Sociology at the University
of Pennsylvania where he teaches graduate courses in methods and
statistics, "Logistic Regression for Rare Events",
<http://statisticalhorizons.com/logistic-regression-for-rare-events>)

Prompted by a 2001 article by King and Zeng, many researchers worry
about whether they can legitimately use conventional logistic regression
for data in which events are rare. **[Although King and Zeng accurately
described the problem and proposed an appropriate solution, [there are
still a lot of misconceptions]{.mark} about this issue.]{.underline}**

**[[The problem is not]{.underline}]{.mark}** specifically **[[the
rarity of events,]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}**
rather **[[the possibility of a small number of cases on the rarer of
the two outcomes.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[If you have a sample size of
1000 but only 20 events, you have a problem. If you have a sample size
of 10,000 with 200 events, you may be OK. If your sample has 100,000
cases with 2000 events, you're golden.]{.underline}**

There's nothing wrong with the logistic model in such cases. The problem
is that maximum likelihood estimation of the logistic model is
well-known to suffer from small-sample bias. And the degree of bias is
strongly dependent on the number of cases in the less frequent of the
two categories. So **[[even with a sample size of 100,000, if there are
only 20 events in the sample, you may have substantial
bias]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Comprehensive analysis [including]{.underline} Rare Events Regression, finds econ decline increases the [worst]{.underline} conflicts

**Tir 10** (Jaroslav, PhD, professor of political science at University
of Colorado at Boulder, "Territorial Diversion: Diversionary Theory of
War and Territorial Conflict," The Journal of Politics, Vol. 72, No. 2,
April 2010, pp. 413--425)

Hypothesis 1 thus receives strong support via the unpopularity variable
but only weak support via the economic growth variable. These
**[[results suggest]{.mark} that embattled leaders are much more likely
to respond with territorial diversions to direct signs of their
unpopularity]{.underline}** (e.g., strikes, protests, riots) **[than to
general background conditions such as economic malaise.]{.underline}**
Presumably, protesters can be distracted via territorial diversions
while ﬁxing the economy would take a more concerted and prolonged policy
effort. **[[Bad economic conditions]{.mark} seem to [motivate]{.mark}
only [the most serious, fatal]{.mark} territorial
[confrontations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This implies that leaders may be
reserving the most high-proﬁle and risky diversions for the times when
they are the most desperate, that is **[[when]{.mark} their [power is
threatened]{.mark} both [by]{.mark} signs of [discontent]{.mark} with
their rule [and]{.mark} by more [systemic]{.mark} problems plaguing the
country [(i.e., an underperforming economy).]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Next, I conduct a series of [follow-up tests]{.mark}]{.underline}**
suggested by an anonymous Reviewer; results based on the reanalysis of
Model 1 are presented in the online appendix. **[Evaluating the
implication that territorial diversions]{.underline}** are indeed
**[more likely to result from diversionary conditions than
nonterritorial diversions]{.underline}**, I set up a multinomial logit
model that contrasts the initiation of territorial MIDs versus
nonterritorial MIDs (base outcome). The results show a positive and
statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for the government unpopularity
variable (ﬁrst column of Table 3), meaning that higher levels of
government unpopularity are more likely to produce territorial rather
than nonterritorial MIDs. **[Further checks]{.underline}**
**[[include]{.mark} performing [rare events logit]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(King and Zeng 2001) **[[and population-averaged logit analyses to
verify whether]{.mark} the rare events nature of [the dependent
variable]{.mark} or cross-sectional characteristics of the data [alter
the ﬁndings]{.mark}, respectively]{.underline}**. **[[The
ﬁndings]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[for the two independent
variables]{.underline}** **[[remain unchanged]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(see Table 3, columns two and three). Finally, protesting behavior in
more populous countries could be considered more ''normal'' and less
threatening to the government, potentially lowering the incentive to
divert. Dividing the government unpopularity variable by the log of
country's population (from the Correlates of War National Capabilities
data set, Singer 1987) reveals that the population size-standardized
government unpopularity variable remains positive and signiﬁcant; see
Table 3, ﬁnal column.

Concerning the control variables, the effects of power and distance are
consistent with expectations and across the Models in Table 1.
Democracy, alliance ties, and trade coefﬁcients have mostly the expected
dampening inﬂuence on territorial conﬂict initiation; but only trade
exhibits a signiﬁcant impact and only when the dependent variable is the
fatal territorial MID (i.e., in Models 3--4). 16 These results are
somewhat surprising, but the reader is reminded that the effects of
alliance are highly contested (see Maoz 2000), while the impact of trade
has not been established in the domain of territorial conﬂict.
Similarly, recent research shows that the **[democratic peace weakens
considerably in the context of territorial conﬂict]{.underline}**
(James, Park, and Choi 2006) **[and that the democratic peace may be
epiphenomenal to territorial peace]{.underline}** (Gibler 2007). **[17
Importantly, the control variable results imply that some of the related
interests]{.underline}** (e.g., security, regime ties) **[may indeed be
subordinated to the territorial diversion impetus.]{.underline}**

**[Revisiting the link between regime type and diversion, some scholars
argue that democratic leaders have a greater
motivation]{.underline}**---due to the need for popular support---**[for
diversion]{.underline}** (e.g., Gelpi 1997; Russett 1990; Smith 1996).
**[Yet, others]{.underline}** (e.g., Downs and Rocke 1994; Miller 1995;
Pickering and Kisangani 2005) [**assert that authoritarian leaders need
popular support in order to appear legitimate**.]{.underline} Because
they cannot derive legitimacy from democratic institutions and
elections, they look to diversions to help them achieve this goal.
Autocrats can also divert with greater impunity due to the lack of
institutional checks and balances. In follow-up tests available from the
online appendix, Table 4, I restrict the set of initiator countries in
Model 1 to democracies only, autocracies only, all nondemocracies, and
all nonautocracies. That [**the [ﬁndings]{.mark} hold [suggest]{.mark}s
that [both democratic and autocratic leaders value territorial
diversions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Nevertheless, resolving the broader
debate is beyond the scope of this study.

Fourth**[, the United States should spread democracy because the
citizens of democracies do not suffer from famines]{.underline}**. The
economist Amartya Sen concludes that \"one of the remarkable facts in
the terrible history of famine is that **[[no substantial famine has
ever occurred in a country with a democratic form of government]{.mark}
and a relatively free press]{.underline}**.\"43 This striking empirical
regularity has been overshadowed by the apparent existence of a
\"democratic peace\" (see below), but it provides a powerful argument
for promoting democracy. Although this claim has been most closely
identified with Sen**[, [other scholars who have studied famines and
hunger reach similar conclusions]{.mark}. Joseph Collins, for example,
argues that: \"Wherever political rights for all citizens truly
flourish, people will see to it that, in due course, they share in
control over economic resources vital to their survival. Lasting food
security thus requires real and sustained democracy]{.underline}**.\"44

Soviet Union (Ukraine in the early 1930s), China, Ethiopia, Somalia,

occurred in many different types of countries, but never in a democracy.

Democracies do not experience famines for two reasons. First, **[in

The need to be reelected impels politicians to ensure that their people
do not starve.]{.underline}** As Sen points out, \"the plight of famine
victims is easy to politicize\" and \"the effectiveness of democracy in
the prevention of famine has tended to depend on the politicization of
the plight of famine victims, through the process of public discussion,
which generates political solidarity.\"45 **[On the other hand,
[authoritarian and totalitarian regimes are not accountable to the
public]{.mark}; they are less likely to pay a political price for
failing to prevent famines. Moreover, authoritarian and totalitarian
rulers often have political incentives to use famine as a means of
exterminating their domestic opponents.]{.underline}**

Second, the existence of a **[[free press and the free flow of
information in democracies prevents famine]{.mark} by serving as an
early warning system on the effects of natural catastrophes such as
floods and droughts that may cause food scarcities. A free press that
criticizes government policies also can publicize the true level of food
stocks and reveal problems of distribution that might cause famines even
when food is plentiful]{.underline}**.46 **[[Inadequate information has
contributed to several famines]{.underline}]{.mark}**. During the
1958-61 famine in China that killed 20-30 million people, the Chinese
authorities overestimated the country\'s grain reserves by 100 million
metric tons. **[This disaster later led Mao Zedong to concede that
\"Without democracy, you have no understanding of what is happening down
below.\"]{.underline}**47 **[[The 1974 Bangladesh famine also could have
been avoided if the government had had better information.]{.mark} The
food supply was high, but floods, unemployment, and panic made it harder
for those in need to obtain food.48]{.underline}**

The two factors that prevent famines in democracies-electoral incentives
and the free flow of information-are likely to be present even in
democracies that do not have a liberal political culture. These factors
exist when leaders face periodic elections and when the press is free to
report information that might embarrass the government. A full-fledged
liberal democracy with guarantees of civil liberties, a relatively free
economic market, and an independent judiciary might be even less likely
to suffer famines, but it appears that the rudiments of electoral
democracy will suffice to prevent famines.

**[The ability of democracies to avoid famines cannot be attributed to
any tendency of democracies to fare better economically. [Poor
democracies as well as rich ones have not had famines.]{.mark} India,
Botswana, and Zimbabwe have avoided famines, even when they have
suffered large crop shortfalls. In fact, the evidence suggests that
democracies can avoid famines in the face of large crop failures,
whereas nondemocracies plunge into famine after smaller
shortfalls.]{.underline}** Botswana\'s food production fell by 17% and
Zimbabwe\'s by 38% between 1979-81 and 1983-84, whereas Sudan and
Ethiopia saw a decline in food production of 11-12% during the same
period. Sudan and Ethiopia, which were nondemocracies, suffered major
famines, whereas the democracies of Botswana and Zimbabwe did not.49
**[If, as I have argued, democracies enjoy better long-run economic
performance than nondemocracies, higher levels of economic development
may help democracies to avoid famines. But [the absence of famines in
new, poor democracies suggests that democratic governance itself is
sufficient to prevent famines.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[There is a high correlation between a country\'s involvement in
conflict]{.mark} and [its]{.mark} classification]{.underline}** by FAO
**[as a "low-income [food deficit]{.mark}" country]{.underline}**. Such
countries have high proportions of food-insecure households. And, as
already noted, conflict is also highly correlated with high rates of
child mortality (see Figure 2), which is a common index for food
insecurity. Nevertheless, a number of analysts have challenged the
notion that food insecurity is a causal factor in conflict. Paarlberg,
for instance, argues that environmental scarcities such as land
shortage, land degradation, and rapid population growth---what he refers
to as "eco-Malthusian emiseration"---are not generally a factor in
African conflicts. Rather, Paarlberg notes, the level of conflict in
Africa has been relatively stable since the end of the colonial era. In
his view, "\[a\] far more convincing explanation for violent conflict in
sub-Saharan Africa starts with the serious geographical mismatch, long
noticed on the continent, between post-colonial national boundaries and
ethnic boundaries." (Paarlberg, 1999, page 1). More generally, Gleditsch
(1998) has pointed out that most conflicts can be sufficiently explained
as a result of political, economic, and cultural factors, without
reference to environmental scarcities. In fact, neither viewpoint
precludes a food-security connection. Even **[Homer-Dixon]{.underline}**
(1999), a leading figure in the environmental security field,
**[concedes that environmental scarcity alone does not inevitably result
in conflict. Instead, he stresses that [resource constraints]{.mark} can
[have a profound influence on the social factors that]{.mark} eventually
[lead to conflict]{.mark}---as when [elites monopolize]{.mark} [control
over scarce resources]{.mark}]{.underline}** (such as water, cropland,

Rwanda over the preceding decade. The collapse of the world price of

and sapped rural households\' purchasing power, even as urban job
opportunities grew scarce and food prices rose.

**[[The biggest threat to global stability is]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
potential for **[[food crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** in poor countries
to **[cause government collapse]{.underline}**. Those **[crises are
brought on by ever worsening environmental degradation]{.underline}**¶
**[One of the toughest things for people to do is to anticipate sudden
change]{.underline}**. Typically we project the future by extrapolating
from trends in the past. Much of the time this approach works well. But
**[sometimes]{.underline}** it fails spectacularly, and **[people are
simply blindsided by events]{.underline}** such as today\'s economic
crisis.¶ For most of us, the idea that civilization itself could
disintegrate probably seems preposterous. Who would not find it hard to
think seriously about such a complete departure from what we expect of
ordinary life? What evidence could make us heed a warning so dire\--and
how would we go about responding to it? We are so inured to a long list
of highly unlikely catastrophes that we are virtually programmed to
dismiss them all with a wave of the hand: Sure, our civilization might
devolve into chaos\--and Earth might collide with an asteroid, too! For
many years I have studied global agricultural, population, environmental
and economic trends and their interactions. The combined effects of
those trends and the political tensions they generate point to the
breakdown of governments and societies. Yet I, too, have resisted the
idea that food shortages could bring down not only individual
governments but also our global civilization.¶ I can no longer ignore
that risk. Our continuing failure to deal with the environmental
declines that are undermining the world food economy\--most important,
falling water tables, eroding soils and rising temperatures\--forces me
to conclude that such **[a collapse is possible]{.underline}**. The
Problem of Failed States Even a cursory look at the vital signs of our
current world order lends unwelcome support to my conclusion. And those
of us in the environmental field are well into our third decade of
charting trends of environmental decline without seeing any significant
effort to reverse a single one. In six of the past nine years world
grain production has fallen short of consumption, forcing a steady
drawdown in stocks. When the 2008 harvest began, world carryover stocks
of grain (the amount in the bin when the new harvest begins) were at 62
days of consumption, a near record low. In response, world grain prices
in the spring and summer of last year climbed to the highest level
ever**[. [As demand]{.mark} for food [rises faster than supplies]{.mark}
are growing, the resulting food-price [inflation puts severe stress
on]{.mark} the [governments]{.mark} of countries [already]{.mark}
teetering [on the edge of chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Unable to buy
grain or grow their own, **[hungry people take to the
streets]{.underline}**. Indeed, even before the steep climb in grain
prices in 2008, the number of failing states was expanding \[see sidebar
at left\]. Many of their problem\'s stem from a failure to slow the
growth of their populations. But if the food situation continues to
deteriorate, **[entire [nations will break down]{.mark} at an ever
increasing rate]{.underline}**. We have entered a new era in
geopolitics**[. In the 20th century the main threat to international
security was superpower conflict; today it is failing
state]{.underline}**s. It is not the concentration of power but its
absence that puts us at risk**[. States fail when national governments
can no longer provide]{.underline}** personal security, **[food
security]{.underline}** and basic social services such as education and
health care. They often lose control of part or all of their territory.
When governments lose their monopoly on power**[, law and order begin to
disintegrate]{.underline}**. After a point, countries can become so
dangerous that food relief workers are no longer safe and their programs
are halted; in Somalia and Afghanistan, deteriorating conditions have
already put such programs in jeopardy. **[[Failing
states]{.underline}]{.mark}** are of international concern because they
**[[are a source of terrorists, drugs, weapons and refugees, threatening
political stability]{.mark} everywhere.]{.underline}** Somalia, number
one on the 2008 list of failing states, has become a base for piracy.
Iraq, number five, is a hotbed for terrorist training. Afghanistan,
number seven, is the world\'s leading supplier of heroin. Following the
massive genocide of 1994 in Rwanda, refugees from that troubled state,
thousands of armed soldiers among them, helped to destabilize
neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (number six). **[Our global

\"**[[As famine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, disease, and weather-related

the minimum requirements for human survival. [**[This \"will
create]{.underline}**]{.mark} a sense of **[desperation, which is likely
to lead to offensive [aggression]{.mark}\" against
countries]{.underline}** with a greater stock of vital resources.
\"**[[Imagine]{.underline}]{.mark}** eastern
**[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**an countries, struggling to feed their
populations with a falling supply of food, water, and energy, **[[eyeing
Russia]{.mark},]{.underline}** whose population is already in decline,
for access to its grain, minerals, and energy supply.\" **[[Similar
scenarios will be replicated all across the
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as those without the means to survival
invade or migrate to those with greater abundance \-- producing endless
struggles between resource \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\" It is this
prospect, more than anything, that worries John Reid. In particular, he
expressed concern over the inadequate capacity of poor and unstable
countries to cope with the effects of climate change, and the
**[[resulting]{.underline}]{.mark}** risk of **[[state collapse]{.mark},
[civil war and mass migration]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \"More than 300
million people in Africa currently lack access to safe water,\" he
observed, and \"climate change will worsen this dire situation\" \--
provoking more wars like Darfur. And even if these social disasters will
occur primarily in the developing world, the wealthier countries will
also be caught up in them, whether by participating in peacekeeping and
humanitarian aid operations, by fending off unwanted migrants or by
fighting for access to overseas supplies of food, oil, and minerals.
When reading of these nightmarish scenarios, it is easy to conjure up
images of desperate, starving people killing one another with knives,
staves and clubs \-- as was certainly often the case in the past, and
could easily prove to be so again. But these scenarios also envision the
use of more deadly weapons. \"**[In this world of warring
states]{.underline}**,\" the 2003 Pentagon report predicted,
\"**[nuclear arms proliferation is inevitable]{.underline}**.\" As oil
and natural gas disappears, more and more countries will rely on nuclear
power to meet their energy needs \-- and this \"will accelerate nuclear
proliferation as countries develop enrichment and reprocessing
capabilities to ensure their national security.\" Although speculative,
these reports make one thing clear: when thinking about the calamitous
effects of global climate change, we must emphasize its social and
political consequences as much as its purely environmental effects.
Drought, flooding and storms can kill us, and surely will \-- but so
will wars among the survivors of these catastrophes over what remains of
food, water and shelter. As Reid\'s comments indicate, **[[no
society]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however affluent, **[[will
escape]{.underline}]{.mark}** involvement in **[[these forms of
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

And **[what standards of international order and law would still

[lash out militarily]{.mark}]{.underline}** at whatever countries it
thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A terrifying
description of the kinds of discussions that might occur appeared in
Brian Jenkins' book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) **[[With the nuclear

that have since cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of
dollars, while plunging a region into chaos. **[Would the reaction after
a far more devastating nuclear attack be any less?]{.underline}**

In particular, the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
**[Powerful states would likely demand]{.underline}** that **[others
surrender their nuclear material or accept foreign troops]{.underline}**
(or other imposed security measures) to guard it.

**[That could well be the first step toward a more profound
transformation of the international system]{.underline}**. After such a
catastrophe, **[[major powers may feel compelled to]{.mark} more freely
[engage in preventive war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, seizing territories
they worry might otherwise be terrorist safe havens, and taking other
steps they see as brutal but necessary to preserve their security. For
this reason, **[foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has
argued]{.underline}** that **["conventional [rules of sovereignty would

as]{.underline}** the **[International Atomic Energy Agency and the
U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations, which had so manifestly
failed to prevent the devastation, **[might
[erode]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The effect on nuclear weapons policies is
hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror driving a new push
for nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine states feeling more
certain than ever before that they needed nuclear weapons.

[[War involving]{.mark} significant fractions of the [U.S. and
Russian]{.mark} nuclear [arsenals,]{.mark}]{.underline} which are by far
[the largest of any nations]{.underline}, [[could have globally
catastrophic effects]{.underline}]{.mark} such as severely reducing food
production for years,1 potentially [[leading to]{.mark} collapse of
modern civilization worldwide and even the **[extinction of
humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2 Nuclear war between the United States
and Russia could occur by various routes, including accidental or
unauthorized launch; deliberate first attack by one nation; and
inadvertent attack. In an accidental or unauthorized launch or
detonation, system safeguards or procedures to maintain control over
nuclear weapons fail in such a way that a nuclear weapon or missile
launches or explodes without direction from leaders. In a deliberate
first attack, the attacking nation decides to attack based on accurate
information about the state of affairs. In an inadvertent attack, the
attacking nation mistakenly concludes that it is under attack and
launches nuclear weapons in what it believes is a counterattack.3
(Brinkmanship strategies incorporate elements of all of the above, in
that they involve intentional manipulation of risks from otherwise
accidental or inadvertent launches.4 ) ¶ Over the years, nuclear
strategy was aimed primarily at minimizing risks of intentional attack
through development of deterrence capabilities, though numerous measures
were also taken to reduce probabilities of accidents, unauthorized
attack, and inadvertent war. For purposes of deterrence, both U.S. and
Soviet/Russian forces have maintained significant capabilities to have
some forces survive a first attack by the other side and to launch a
subsequent counterattack. However, concerns about the extreme
disruptions that a first attack would cause in the other side's forces
and command-and-control capabilities led to both sides' development of
capabilities to detect a first attack and launch a counter-attack before
suffering damage from the first attack.5¶ Many people believe that with
the end of the Cold War and with improved relations between the United
States and Russia, the risk of East-West nuclear war was significantly
reduced.6 However, it has also been argued that [**[inadvertent nuclear
war]{.mark}** between the United States and Russia has
[continue]{.mark}]{.underline}d [[to present]{.mark} a **[substantial
risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}.7 While the United States and Russia are not
actively threatening each other with war, they have remained ready to
launch nuclear missiles in response to indications of attack.8¶ [False
indicators of nuclear attack could be caused in several
ways]{.underline}. First, a wide range of events have already been
mistakenly interpreted as indicators of attack, including weather
phenomena, a faulty computer chip, wild animal activity, and
control-room training tapes loaded at the wrong time.9 Second,
[[terrorist groups]{.mark} or other actors [might cause attacks
on]{.mark} either [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [or Russia

#### Detonation causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--even [without]{.underline} retaliation

Sciences at CU-Boulder, et al. Owen B., April 19, 2007, "Atmospheric
Effects and Societal Consequences of Regional Scale Nuclear Conflicts
and Acts of Individual Nuclear Terrorism," online:

To an increasing extent, **[people are congregating in the world's great
urban centers, creating megacities with populations exceeding 10 million
individuals]{.underline}**. At the same time, **[advanced technology has
designed nuclear [explosives of]{.mark} such [small size]{.mark} they
can be easily transported in a car]{.underline}**, small plane or boat
**[to the heart of a city]{.underline}**. We demonstrate here that **[a
single detonation in the 15 kiloton range [can produce]{.mark} urban
fatalities approaching one million]{.underline}** in some cases, **[and
[casualties exceeding one million]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thousands of
small weapons still exist in the arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, and
there are at least six other countries with substantial nuclear weapons
inventories. In all, thirty-three countries control sufficient amounts
of highly enriched uranium or plutonium to assemble nuclear explosives.
A conflict between any of these countries involving 50-100 weapons with
yields of 15 kt has the potential to create fatalities rivaling those of
the Second World War. Moreover, **[even [a single]{.mark} surface
nuclear [explosion]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or an air burst in rainy
conditions, **[in a city center [is likely to cause the]{.mark} entire
metropolitan [area to be abandoned]{.mark} at least [for
decades]{.mark}]{.underline}** owing to infrastructure damage and
radioactive contamination. As the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in
Louisiana suggests, **[the [economic consequences of even a localized
nuclear catastrophe would]{.mark} most likely [have severe]{.mark}
national and [international]{.mark} economic
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Striking effects result even from
relatively small nuclear attacks because low yield detonations are most
effective against city centers where business and social activity as
well as population are concentrated. Rogue nations and **[[terrorists
would]{.mark} be most likely to [strike there]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Accordingly, **[[an]{.underline}]{.mark}** organized **[[attack]{.mark}
on the U.S. by a small nuclear state, or terrorists]{.underline}**
supported by such a state, **[[could generate casualties comparable
to]{.mark} those]{.underline}** once **[predicted for [a full-scale
nuclear]{.mark} "counterforce" [exchange in a superpower
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Remarkably, the **[estimated quantities
of [smoke generated]{.mark} by attacks totaling about one megaton of
nuclear explosives [could lead to significant global climate
perturbations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Robock et al., 2007). While we did
not extend our casualty and damage predictions to include potential
medical, social or economic impacts following the initial explosions,
such analyses have been performed in the past for large-scale nuclear
war scenarios (Harwell and Hutchinson, 1985). Such a study should be
carried out as well for the present scenarios and physical outcomes.

#### Global nuclear war 

**Ayson 10** (Robert, professor of strategic studies and director of the
Centre for Strategic Studies, "After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack:
Envisaging Catalytic Effects," June 21,
<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1057610X.2010.483756>)

[A **Catalytic Response**: **Dragging in the Major Nuclear
Powers**]{.underline} A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of
nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place,
would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds
imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether [[nuclear
terrorism should]{.underline}]{.mark} ever [[be regarded
as]{.underline}]{.mark} belonging in the category of truly
**[[existential threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A contrast can be drawn
here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear
exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these
weapons in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the
twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance
alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have
wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as
the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of
nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a
truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state
possessors themselves. But these two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor
nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not
necessarily separable. It is just possible that some sort of terrorist
attack, and especially an act of [nuclear [terrorism, could precipitate
a **chain of events** leading to a **massive exchange of nuclear
weapons** between]{.mark} two or more of the [states]{.mark} that
possess them]{.underline}. In this context, today\'s and tomorrow\'s
terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold
War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were
seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between the
superpowers started by third parties. These risks were considered in the
late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation,
the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a considerable amount of
imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act [of
nuclear terrorism could lead to]{.underline} such [a **massive
inter-state nuclear war**]{.underline}. For example, in the event of a
terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered
just how [[Russia and]{.mark}/or [China could]{.mark}]{.underline}
plausibly [[be brought in]{.mark}to the picture]{.underline}, not least
because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state
sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too
responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior
that could just as easily threaten them as well. [Some
possibilities]{.underline}, however remote, do [suggest
themselves]{.underline}. For example, [how might the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [react if
it]{.underline} was [thought]{.underline} or discovered that the
[fissile material]{.underline} used in the act of nuclear terrorism [had
come from Russian stocks]{.underline}, 40 and if for some reason Moscow
denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? The [**[correct
attribution]{.mark}** of]{.underline} that [nuclear material to
a]{.underline} particular [country [might not be]{.mark} a case of
[science fiction]{.mark}]{.underline} given the observation by Michael
May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion
would be "spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity
makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of
information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the
explosion, the materials used and, most important ... some indication of
where the nuclear material came from." 41 [[**Alternatively**,
if]{.underline}]{.mark} the act of [nuclear [terrorism came as
a]{.mark}]{.underline} complete [[surprise]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully
responsible (or responsible at all) [[suspicion would shift]{.mark}
immediately [to state possessors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ruling out
Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably
Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a
very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program
continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and
China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear
Cluedo? In particular, if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against
a backdrop of existing tension in Washington\'s relations with Russia
and/or China, and at a time when threats had already been traded between
these major powers, would officials and political leaders not be tempted
to assume the worst? Of course, the chances of this occurring would only
seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort
of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were
confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as
these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well
apply too: should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China
during a period of heightened tension or even limited conflict with the
United States, could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might
rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible
perpetrator or encourager of the attack?
[[Washington\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} early
[[response]{.underline}]{.mark} to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own
soil [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[raise the possibility of
a]{.underline}]{.mark}n unwanted (and [**[nuclear]{.mark} aided)
[confrontation with Russia and]{.mark}/or [China]{.mark}**. For example,
[in]{.mark} the]{.underline} noise and [[confusion]{.underline}]{.mark}
during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, [the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} president [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} be
expected to [[place the]{.underline}]{.mark} country\'s armed forces,
including its [nuclear [arsenal, on]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[higher]{.underline}]{.mark} stage of [[alert]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the
friction of reality, it is just possible that [[Moscow and]{.mark}/or
[China might]{.mark} mistakenly [read this as a sign of U.S.
intentions]{.mark} to use]{.underline} force (and possibly [nuclear
force) against them]{.underline}. In that situation, the [[temptations
to **preempt**]{.underline}]{.mark} such actions [[might
grow]{.underline}]{.mark}, although it must be admitted that [any
preemption would]{.underline} probably still [meet with a devastating
response]{.underline}.

<https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/05/deadliest-terrorist-groups-in-the-world/#4809af7b2b3e>

[Of the [18,814 deaths]{.mark} caused [by terrorists]{.mark} around the
world [last year]{.mark}, well over half were due to the actions of just
four groups: Islamic State, the Taliban, Al-Shabaab and Boko
Haram]{.underline}. According to Global Terrorism Index 2018, compiled
by the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP), [these four organizations
were responsible for 10,632 deaths in 2017]{.underline}. Their [[actions
contribute to the instability]{.underline}]{.mark} of what are [some [of
the most dangerous countries in the world]{.mark}, including
Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia and Syria]{.underline}. [Over the
past decade they have accounted for 44% of all terrorist
deaths]{.underline}. [Islamic State -- 4,350 deaths in 2017]{.underline}
Also known in the Arab world as Daesh and by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL,
[[Islamic State]{.mark} has been [the deadliest terrorist group]{.mark}
in the world [for]{.mark} the [past three years]{.mark}.]{.underline} It
remains capable of launching attacks in those countries and has also
inspired individuals and affiliated groups to stage attacks in other
parts of the Middle East as well as Europe and Asia. [ISIS tends to
prefer bombings or explosions -- these accounted for 69% of its attacks
last year. However, it also carries out hostage takings and
assassinations]{.underline}. [[The Taliban]{.mark} -- 3,571 deaths in
2017]{.underline} The Afghan group has been [waging a war of attrition
with the U.S.-backed coalition since 2001 and has proven remarkably
resilient]{.underline}. As of mid-2017, [it controlled an estimated 11%
of the country and was contesting a further 29% of Afghanistan's 398
districts. It [is active in 70% of Afghanistan's
provinces]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In 2017, Taliban forces were
responsible for 699 attacks, causing 3,571 deaths, with armed assaults
and bombings the most common form of attack]{.underline}. In addition,
its affiliate in neighbouring Pakistan, [Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, was
responsible for a further 56 attacks and 233 deaths]{.underline}. [The
[Taliban\'s actions have become more deadly in the past year, killing an
average of 5.1 people per attack in 2017]{.mark} (up from 4.2 people the
year before).]{.underline} The group has adjusted its tactics in recent
years, [switching its focus away from attacks on civilian targets and
towards police and military personnel.]{.underline} [The [Taliban killed
2,419 police and military personnel in 2017, up from 1,782 the year
before]{.mark}]{.underline}. The number of attacks on such targets also
[increased from 369 in 2016 to 386 in 2017.[Al-Shabaab]{.mark} -- 1,457
deaths in 2017]{.underline} The extremist militant group Al-Shabaab
[emerged in 2006]{.underline}. It [[is an]{.underline} [affiliate of
Al-Qaida]{.underline}]{.mark} [and while its main area of operations is
Somalia, it has also carried out attacks in Ethiopia, Kenya and
Uganda]{.underline}. Al-Shabaab was the [[deadliest terror group in
sub-Saharan Africa in 2017]{.mark}, being [responsible for 1,457
deaths]{.mark}, a [rise of 93% on the year before]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Two-thirds of the deaths were in the Somali capital Mogadishu. The
[[worst incident]{.mark} was [in]{.mark} October 20[17, when 588 people
were killed]{.mark} and 316 injured in an explosion outside the Safari
Hotel in the Hodan area of the city.]{.underline} Somalia, however, has
been an unfortunate exception to that trend, due to the actions of
Al-Shabaab. [There have been almost 6,000 deaths from terrorism in the
country since 2001. Boko Haram -- 1,254 deaths in 2017]{.underline} The
[[Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram]{.underline}]{.mark} (also known
by the far longer name Jama'tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad). Since
it emerged in the northeast of the country in 2002 it has [spread out to
other nearby countries including Chad, Cameroon and Niger and the group
has sworn allegiance to Islamic State.]{.underline} [Boko Haram [carried
out 40% more attacks and]{.mark} was [responsible for 15% more deaths in
2017 than in the year before]{.mark}.]{.underline} Most of the group\'s
attacks last year were carried out in Nigeria -- particularly in Borno
State -- with smaller numbers in Cameroon and Niger. [The [group]{.mark}
has [gained notoriety]{.mark} [for]{.mark} mass hostage takings and the
[extensive use of children and women as suicide
bombers]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### On the brink -- terrorist groups are already building nuclear weapons

**NTI No Date \-\--** Nuclear Threat Initiative, "WORKING TO KEEP
NUCLEAR WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS",
<https://www.nti.org/about/nuclear-terrorism/>

Preventing nuclear terrorism has been at the heart of NTI's work since
our founding. Early on, we supported field projects to secure vulnerable
weapons-usable materials---plutonium and highly enriched uranium. For
example, Project Vinca helped spur the creation of a U.S. government
threat-reduction program that has invested more than \$3 billion over
the last decade to secure and remove at-risk nuclear materials from
sites around the globe. The good news is that the number of countries
storing these dangerous materials has dropped from a high of 52 in 1992.
[The bad news is that [increasingly well-organized and well-funded
terrorist organizations]{.mark}---which [now have easy access to]{.mark}
the know-how needed to [build a bomb]{.mark}--- [have declared their
intent to seek the materials necessary for weapons of mass
destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline} Today, [we work with governments to
define, assess and improve nuclear materials security.]{.underline} A

tool for governments.

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Demo\-\--New\-\--Terror\-\--A2: No Terror\-\--Means

#### Recent studies prove that terrorists can acquire nukes through theft or construction.

**Union of Concerned Scientists 19** --- Union of Concerned Scientists,
a nonprofit science advocacy organization made up of scientists and
experts in different fields, 2019 ("Nuclear Terrorism Overview," *Union
of Concerned Scientists,* April 15^th^, Available Online at
<https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/nuclear-terrorism/overview>,
Accessed 07-11-2019)

**[[Of all the terrorist threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** facing the
United States and the world, perhaps **[[the gravest is]{.mark} the
possibility of [terrorists constructing or obtaining a nuclear
weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}** and detonating it in a city. If a
terrorist group exploded just one nuclear weapon, hundreds of thousands
of people could die. Because there is no effective protection against a
nuclear blast, one viable solution is to prevent terrorists from
obtaining nuclear bomb materials or weapons in the first place.

The United States and other **[[countries are paying insufficient
attention to this problem and]{.mark}, in some cases, [pursuing policies
that increase the risk of terrorists acquiring nuclear
weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

A nuclear weapon requires either highly enriched uranium (HEU) or
plutonium. Fortunately, these materials are not found in nature and are
difficult to produce. This means **[there are only two plausible ways
for [terrorists]{.mark} to acquire nuclear weapons]{.underline}**.
First, they **[[could steal an intact nuclear
weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}** from existing arsenals **[[or]{.mark}
purchase a stolen weapon]{.underline}**. More likely**[, [terrorists
could acquire the material needed to build a nuclear
weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the expertise to construct a workable
bomb from this material.

Because **[only a relatively small amount of HEU or plutonium is needed
to build a bomb]{.underline}**, **[[terrorists could feasibly steal
enough material to build one or more nuclear
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A crude nuclear weapon would use 40-50
kilograms (88-110 pounds) of HEU; a more sophisticated design would
require 12 kilograms (26 pounds) of HEU or 4 kilograms (9 pounds) of
plutonium. The theft of HEU would be especially worrisome, because
**[[it is relatively straightforward to make a
bomb]{.underline}]{.mark}** using this material.

Unfortunately, **[[there are numerous]{.underline}]{.mark}** potential
**[[sources of]{.mark} nuclear [weapons and]{.mark}]{.underline}**
weapons **[[materials worldwide and several]{.underline}]{.mark}** types
of **[[shortcomings in]{.mark} current [security]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and accounting measures, some of which we list below.

Several countries possess large stockpiles of civil plutonium for use in
nuclear power reactors. Civil stockpiles stored in Belgium, France,
Germany, India, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom comprise more than
230 metric tons of plutonium. Despite these enormous stockpiles, France,
India, Japan, Russia, and the UK continue reprocessing in order to
produce more civil plutonium. While civil plutonium is not
\"weapon-grade,\" it can still be used to make nuclear weapons.

The United States has a relatively small amount of civil plutonium
compared with these other countries because it decided in the 1970s to
suspend the separation of plutonium from civil spent nuclear fuel.

Russia and the United States possess enormous stockpiles of military
plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons. Russia\'s stockpile comprises
some 150 metric tons and the U.S. stockpile comprises 100 metric tons.
Each country has pledged to dispose of 34 metric tons, but neither
effort has gotten off the ground. Moreover, the method they have
chosen---**[[turning the plutonium into fuel fo]{.mark}r nuclear
[reactors]{.mark}---[could]{.mark} actually [increase the risk
of]{.mark} plutonium [theft]{.mark} unless stringent security measures
are applied]{.underline}**.

HEU is used to fuel well over 100 research reactors worldwide in dozens
of countries. Many of these facilities are in academic or industrial
settings with inadequate security---making them even more attractive
targets for terrorists seeking nuclear weapons materials.

In 2005, the U.S. Congress eliminated long-standing restrictions on
exporting HEU to other countries for the purpose of making medical
isotopes.

Russia and the United States possess enormous stockpiles of military
HEU. Russia has more than 1,000 metric tons, half of which it now
considers \"excess\" to its security needs and is being converted to
low-enriched uranium that cannot be used for weapons. The United States
has more than 700 metric tons, of which it has declared 174 metric tons
as excess. The HEU conversion and disposal programs in both countries
are proceeding slowly, and even after their completion, each country
will be left with more than 500 metric tons of HEU---enough for 10,000
simple nuclear weapons.

**[[Thousands of]{.mark} so-called tactical nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}---[many of which]{.mark} are quite small and [do not
have electronic locks to prevent their unauthorized use---are stored in
Russia]{.mark}, some [in poorly secured
locations.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In addition, the United States
maintains some 150 tactical nuclear weapons in Europe as part of NATO
forces, and stores roughly 1,000 such weapons within its own borders.

**[[Tons of]{.mark} Russian [nuclear materials are stored under
inadequate security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. During the Soviet era, the
state limited access to cities in which these materials were stored, but
did not keep strict account of the material or worry about theft by
citizens who did have access. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
that is no longer a viable strategy. Security upgrades (such as fences
and controlled access) have been made to many sites, but not all.

**[[Even in countries such as France, Japan, and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates[, security measures for protecting weapon]{.mark}-usable
[materials from theft are]{.mark} probably [inadequate to protect
against]{.mark} contemporary [terrorist threats.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### The risk has never been higher -- a single-attack kills millions and escalates global conflict -- goes nuclear 

**Arguello 18** (Irma, founder and chair of the NPSGlobal Foundation,
and head of the secretariat of the Latin American and Caribbean
Leadership Network, degree in physics, a Master's in business
administration, and completed graduate studies in defense and security,
"The global impacts of a terrorist nuclear attack: What would happen?
What should we do?," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 2-21,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2018.1436812>)

Though hard to accept, **[the detonation of a nuclear device --
by]{.underline}** states or **[non-state actors -- is today a plausible
scenario.]{.underline}** And while much of the world's focus has been on
the current nuclear weapons arsenals possessed by states -- about 14,550
warheads, all of which carry the risk of intentional or unintentional
use -- [**[the threat of nuclear terrorism is here and
increasing]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[For more than a decade, [Al Qaeda,
Aum Shinrikyo, and other terrorist groups have expressed]{.mark} their
[desire]{.mark} to acquire fissile material [to build and
detonate]{.mark} an improvised nuclear bomb.]{.underline}** None of them
could fulfill that goal -- so far. But that does not mean that they will
not succeed in the future. Making matters worse, **[[there is evidence
of an illicit market for]{.mark} nuclear weapons-usable
[materials]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[There are [sellers in search
of]{.mark} potential [buyers, as shown by]{.mark} the dismantlement of a
nuclear smuggling network in [Moldova]{.mark} in 2015]{.underline}**.
**[There]{.underline}** certainly **[are plenty of sites from which to
obtain nuclear material]{.underline}**. According to the 2016 Nuclear
Security Index by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, **[[24 countries still
host]{.mark} inventories of [nuclear]{.mark} weapons-usable
[materials]{.mark}]{.underline}**, stored in facilities with different
degrees of security. And in terms of risk, it is not necessary for a
given country to possess nuclear weapons, weapons-usable materials, or
nuclear facilities for it to be useful to nuclear terrorists:
**[Structural and institutional weaknesses in a country may make it
favorable for the illicit trade of materials]{.underline}**. Permeable
boundaries, high levels of corruption, weaknesses in judicial systems,
and consequent impunity may give rise to a series of transactions and
other events, which could end in a nuclear attack. The truth is that, at
**[this stage, no country in possession of nuclear weapons or
weapons-usable materials can guarantee their full protection against
nuclear terrorism or nuclear smuggling.]{.underline}** Because we live
in a world of growing insecurity, where explicit and tacit agreements
between the relevant powers -- which upheld global stability during the
post- Cold War -- are giving way to increasing mistrust and hostility, a
question arises: How would our lives be affected if a current terrorist
group such as the Islamic State (ISIS), or new terrorist groups in the
future, succeed in evolving from today's Manchester style "low-tech"
attacks to a "high-tech" one, involving a nuclear bomb, detonated in a
capital city, anywhere in the world? We attempted to answer this
question in a report developed by a high-level multidisciplinary expert
group convened by the NPSGlobal Foundation for the Latin American and
Caribbean Leadership Network. We found that there would be multiple
harmful effects that would spread promptly around the globe (Arguello
and Buis 2016); a more detailed analysis is below, which highlights the
need for the creation of a comprehensive nuclear security system. The
consequences of a terrorist nuclear attack **[[A small and
primitive]{.mark} 1-kiloton fission [bomb]{.mark}]{.underline}** (with a
yield of about one-fifteenth of the one dropped on Hiroshima, and
certainly much less sophisticated; cf. Figure 1), **[detonated in any
large capital city of the developed world, [would cause an unprecedented
catastrophic scenario]{.mark}. An estimate of direct
effects]{.underline}** in the attack's location **[includes [a death
toll of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
7,300-to-**[[23,000]{.underline}]{.mark}** people and 12,600-to-57,000
people injured, depending on the target's geography and population
density. Total physical destruction of the city's infrastructure, due to
the blast (shock wave) and thermal radiation, would cover a radius of
about 500 meters from the point of detonation (also known as ground
zero), while ionizing radiation greater than 5 Sieverts -- compatible
with the deadly acute radiation syndrome -- would expand within an
850-meter radius. From the environmental point of view, such an area
would be unusable for years. In addition, radioactive fallout would
expand in an area of about 300 square kilometers, depending on
meteorological conditions (cf. Figure 2). But the consequences would go
far beyond the effects in the target country, however, and promptly
propagate worldwide. **[Global and national security]{.underline}**,
economy and finance, **[international governance and its framework,
national political systems, and the behavior of governments and
individuals would all be put under severe trial.]{.underline}** The
severity of the effects at a national level, however, would depend on
the countries' level of development, geopolitical location, and
resilience. **[[Global security]{.mark} and regional/national defense
schemes [would be strongly affected]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[An
increase in [global distrust would spark rising tensions]{.mark} among
countries and blocs, [that could even lead to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
brink of **[[nuclear]{.mark} weapons [use]{.mark}]{.underline}** by
states (if, for instance, a sponsor country is identified). **[[The
consequences]{.mark} of such a shocking scenario [would include]{.mark}
a decrease in states' self-control, an [escalation of present conflicts
and]{.mark} the emergence of [new ones]{.mark}, accompanied by an
increase in military unilateralism and military
expenditures.]{.underline}** Regarding the economic and financial
impacts, a **[severe global economic depression would rise from the
attack]{.underline}**, likely **[lasting for years. Its]{.underline}**
duration would be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. **[The
main results of such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth
in global]{.underline}** **[G]{.underline}**ross
**[D]{.underline}**omestic **[P]{.underline}**roduct, and a 4 percent
decline of international trade in the two years following the attack
(cf. Figure 3). In the case of developing and less-developed countries,
**[the [economic impacts would]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[include a
shortage of]{.mark} high-tech]{.underline}**nology **[products such as
[medicines]{.mark}, as well as a]{.underline}** fall in foreign direct
investment and a **[severe decline of international [humanitarian
aid]{.mark} toward low-income countries.]{.underline}** We expect an
increase of unemployment and poverty in all countries. **[[Global
poverty would raise about 4 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}** after the
attack, which implies that at least **[[30 million more]{.mark} people
would be [living in extreme poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in addition
to the current estimated 767 million. In the area of international
relations, we would **[expect a breakdown of key doctrines involving
politics, security, and relations among states]{.underline}**. **[[These
international tensions could lead to a collapse of the nuclear
order]{.mark}]{.underline}** as we know it today, **[[with]{.mark} a
consequent [setback of]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}nuclear
disarmament and **[[nonprolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration
**[commitments]{.underline}**. In other words, the whole system based on
the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty would be put under severe trial.
After the attack, there would be a reassessment of existing security
doctrines, and a deep review of concepts such as nuclear deterrence,
no-first use, proportionality, and negative security assurances.
Finally, the behavior of governments and individuals would also change
radically. **[Internal chaos]{.underline}** fueled by the media and
social networks **[would threaten governance at all
levels]{.underline}**, with greater impact on those countries with weak
institutional frameworks. **[Social [turbulence would emerge]{.mark} in
most countries, with [consequent attempts by governments to impose
restrictions on personal freedoms]{.mark} to preserve
order]{.underline}** -- possibly **[by declaring a state
of]{.underline}** siege or state of **[emergency]{.underline}** -- and
legislation would surely become tougher on human rights. **[There
would]{.underline}** also **[be a significant increase in social
fragmentation]{.underline}** -- with a deepening of antagonistic views,
mistrust, and intolerance, both within countries and towards others --
and a resurgence of large-scale social movements fostered by ideological
interests and easily mobilized through social media.

#### Threat is high. Nuclear terrorists have multiple means of acquisition and will detonate in the U.S.

Terrorism Is Most Urgent Threat", CNN, 4-8,

But I did not lose my belief that **[the danger of [nuclear
terror]{.mark}ism [was the most urgent threat]{.mark} we
face]{.underline}**. Nor did I lose my passion for working, albeit in a
new way, to address that threat. I am working on this issue now as part
of the international Global Zero movement, in which political, military
and faith leaders, experts and activists strive for the worldwide
elimination of all nuclear weapons.

We know that **[terrorist [groups have been trying]{.mark} to buy, build
or steal a bomb]{.underline}**.

**[In the past two decades, [there have been]{.mark}]{.underline}** at
least **[25 [instances of]{.mark} nuclear]{.underline}** explosive
**[[materials]{.mark} being [lost or stolen]{.mark}. There is
[enough]{.mark}]{.underline}** highly enriched uranium, or HEU, in the
world today **[[to build]{.underline}]{.mark}** more than **[[100,000
bombs]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[Terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}** looking to buy or steal HEU
**[[could look to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the approximately **[[40
countries]{.mark} [with]{.mark} nuclear]{.underline}** weapons
**[[materials. And]{.underline}]{.mark}** then there are
**[[rogue]{.mark} [individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}** out there who
**[are running black markets]{.underline}** selling nuclear materials
and technology.

Pakistan\'s Dr. **[A. Q. Khan did it for years]{.underline}** before my
group at the CIA brought him down in December 2003 after catching him
red-handed selling a full-scale nuclear bomb to Moammar Gadhafi\'s
regime in Libya.

If **[[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}** manage to get their hands on
enough HEU, they **[[could smuggle]{.mark} it into a]{.underline}**
target **[city, build a bomb [and explode it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A
hundred pounds of highly enriched uranium could fit in a shoebox, and
**[[100,000 shipping containers come in]{.mark}to the

There are two major dimensions of the nuclear terrorist threat: the
"supply" side of nuclear proliferation and the "demand" side of violent
Islamist extremism. Over the past decade, longstanding
**[[concerns]{.mark} over proliferation [have become increasingly
acute]{.mark} in light of]{.underline}** a number of worrisome
developments, including the status of **[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and **[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}** as overt nuclear weapon states,
**[[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s two nuclear weapons tests, the
international community's failure to restrain Iran's nuclear ambitions,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the fear that an
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**ian nuclear weapons program could spark
further proliferation throughout the Middle East. Ultimately, while
existing nuclear arsenals and stockpiles of fissile material represent
the most immediate concern, **[the [spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
and [material]{.mark} has increased the probability that
[terrorists]{.mark} might]{.underline}** be able to **[[acquire]{.mark}
or construct a nuclear device]{.underline}**. At the same time that
nuclear proliferation has become a growing concern, **[[terrorism
has]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[been [elevated]{.mark}]{.underline}**
from a secondary **[[to a primary threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** to US
security **[because of the emergence of groups that have few inhibitions
on inflicting mass casualties by means of]{.underline}** chemical,
biological, and even **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Today, for
example, the threat of nuclear

#### Threat's high 

**Defence Journal 12** (Ashfaq Ahmed and Saima Kausar, Defence Journal,
9/30, lexis)

International community is aware of the **[[terrorists\'
intent]{.mark}ions [to acquire nuclear material]{.mark}. We
are]{.underline}** thus **[living with the]{.underline}** modern day
**[nightmare]{.underline}** of the **[possibility of nuclear
terrorism]{.underline}**. Among **[[non- state
actors]{.underline}]{.mark}** Al Qaeda is considered to be the most
aspirant organization which **[has used resources and
[made]{.mark}]{.underline}** foiled **[[attempts]{.mark}]{.underline}**
to acquire nuclear weapon/material and use it. Analysts fears that
**[hostile states]{.underline}** namely **[[Iran and North Korea would
provide]{.underline}]{.mark}** nuclear **[[material to
terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}** to use it against their enemies.
Despite the fact international community realized the threat of nuclear
terrorism in 1990s, **[[IAEA has registered 800
cases]{.underline}]{.mark}**, since end of the Cold War to 2010,
**[[where]{.mark}in [radioactive material was]{.mark}]{.underline}**
either **[missing or]{.underline}** it was **[[taken]{.mark} into
possession [by smugglers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As all roads of
terrorist activities are linked with Pakistan, this country can face
serious problems if terrorists succeeds in their attempts.
**[[Several]{.mark} terrorist [organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
non- state actors across the globe have
[e**[xpressed]{.underline}**]{.mark} their **[[resolve to
acquire]{.underline}]{.mark}** Chemical, Biological, Radiological and
Nuclear (**[[CBRN]{.mark}) material]{.underline}**. Among these
terrorists organizations Al Qaeda has made multiple attempts and
expressed its determination to obtain nuclear material. Prosecution
witness Jamal Ahmad Al Fadl quit Al Qaeda in 1996 and assisted Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Fadl while recording his statement in court claimed that in late 1993 or
early 1994 Al Qaeda made an attempt to acquire uranium worth \$ 1.5
million. Amount was paid to former Sudanese president Saleh Mobruk. In
post 9/11 era many feared that terrorists would acquire WMD and use it
against their enemies and enemy allies. In 1998 Al Qaeda Chief Osama bin
Laden declared, \"it is his duty to obtain WMD.\"Al Qaeda senior
leadership in pre 9/11 era pursued strategy to acquire nuclear and
biological weapons. **[Non-state actors]{.underline}** particularly Bin
Laden and his followers **[pursued first use policy]{.underline}** and
to use these weapons after getting their hold on these weapons against
their enemies or their allies anywhere in the world. Bin Laden initiated
his fight against US believing it a holy war between Muslims and
Christen-Jews Crusaders, to change the status quo in international
system. He thought once the status quo is changed overall conditions
would be conducive for the organizations to overthrow the apostate
regimes/governments in Islamic states and Islamic Caliphate would be
restored. In order to inflict massive harm to its enemies Al Qaeda\'s
strategy is focused on acquiring \"strategic weapons.\" \"Documents
seized in Afghan training camps in late 2001 also indicate a rudimentary
understanding of nuclear fission devices.\" Khalid Sheikh Muhammad,
mastermind of 9/11 attacks, was interviewed by Al Jazeera in, 2002. Al
Qaeda leader stated that \"Al Qaeda initially planned to include a
nuclear plant in its 2001 attack sites, intensified concern about
aircraft crashes.\" Acquisition of poisonous material had remained of
little interest for Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda operatives were experimenting on
\"crude chemical agents\" before 9/11 in its training camps in
Afghanistan. However, their use was left on the individuals outside Al
Qaeda core leadership command. Abu Khabab planned small scale chemical
and biological activity, in 2002 and 2003 Abu Masab al Zarqawi planned
attacks using ricin and cyanide in Europe and Bahrain based terror group
also devised a plan to carryout attack using crude cyanide gas device in
New York City subway. Al Qaeda top leadership was kept uniformed of
these attacks. Later, Al Zawahiri comes to know about New York subway
planned attack he cancelled it \"for something better.\" After reading
the preceding paragraphs it is understood that unlike state actors, who
are determined to acquire nuclear weapons to boost their security and
deter enemies, **[[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[have three
routes]{.mark} to get hold on these weapons. [First acquire WMD. Second,
develop]{.mark}]{.underline}** nuclear device or **[[dirty bomb.
Thirdly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, terrorist can carry-out
**[[attack]{.mark} on [nuclear]{.mark} programme
[sites]{.mark}/]{.underline}**complexes. Cont.... According to IAEA, 433
power plants and 240 operational nuclear research reactors are operating
internationally. Despite the fact that measures are taken to deny the
right of terrorists/non state actors to acquire nuclear material,
**[[fissile material is produced in great quantity - around the
globe]{.underline}]{.mark}** both for military purposes and civilian
needs. Such material is **[dispersed at various sites]{.underline}**
worldwide. **[It is more difficult to maintain strict
control]{.underline}** over fissile material than over nuclear weapons.
States posed with security threats are attempting to develop clandestine
nuclear weapons programme in violation of the Non Proliferation Treaty
(NPT). Iran is suspected by the US that it is violating the clauses of
the NPT and developing nuclear programme for military purposes.
Proliferators want to get nuclear weapons in order to employ them to
deter their enemies both potential and declared rather than use it.
However, **[presence of huge stockpile of nuclear fissile
material,]{.underline}** spread of nuclear weapons and existing nuclear
arsenals have created fear that **[terrorists may either acquire or
construct a nuclear device]{.underline}**. Legacy of the **[[risk of
nuclear attack will persist]{.underline}]{.mark}** as long as fissile
material exists.

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Internet

#### Presidential powers allow Trump to [hijack the internet]{.underline}

**[[One power poses a singular threat to democracy in the digital
era.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In 1942, **[[Congress amended Section 706 of
the Communications Act]{.mark} of 1934 [to allow the president
to]{.mark} shut down or take [control]{.mark} of "[any facility]{.mark}
or station [for wire communication]{.mark}" upon his proclamation "that
there exists a state or threat of war involving the United
States]{.underline}**," resurrecting a similar power Congress had
briefly provided Woodrow Wilson during World War I. At the time, "wire
communication" meant telephone calls or telegrams. Given the relatively
modest role that electronic communications played in most Americans'
lives, the government's assertion of this power during World War II (no
president has used it since) likely created inconvenience but not havoc.

We live in a different universe today. Although interpreting a 1942 law
to cover the internet might seem far-fetched, some government officials
recently endorsed this reading during debates about cybersecurity
legislation. Under this interpretation, **[[Section 706 could]{.mark}
effectively [function as a "kill switch]{.mark}" in the U.S.---one [that
would be available]{.mark} to the president [the moment he proclaimed a
mere threat]{.mark} of war. [It]{.mark} could also [give the president
power to assume control over]{.mark} U.S. [internet
traffic.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The potential impact of such a move can hardly be overstated. In August,
in an early-morning tweet, **[[Trump lamented that search engines were
"RIGGED"]{.mark} to serve up negative articles about him]{.underline}**.
Later that day **[the administration said it was looking into regulating
the big internet companies.]{.underline}** "I think that Google and
Twitter and Facebook, they're really treading on very, very troubled
territory. And they have to be careful," Trump warned. If the government
were to take control of U.S. internet infrastructure, **[[Trump could
accomplish]{.mark} directly [what he threatened]{.mark} to do by
regulation[: ensure that internet searches always return pro-Trump
content]{.mark} as the top results.]{.underline}** The government also
would have the ability to impede domestic access to particular websites,
including social-media platforms. **[[It could monitor emails or]{.mark}
prevent them from reaching their destination. It could [exert control
over computer systems]{.mark} ([such as]{.mark} states' [voter
databases) and physical devices]{.mark} (such as Amazon's Echo speakers)
that are connected to the internet.]{.underline}**

#### Internet repression dooms innovation -- that's key to solve all collective problems

**Genachowski 13** (Chair-FCC, 4/16, \"The Plot to Block Internet
Freedom\",
http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/16/plot_block_internet_freedom?page=full)

The Internet has created an extraordinary new democratic forum for
people around the world to express their opinions. It is revolutionizing
global access to information: Today, more than 1 billion people
worldwide have access to the Internet, and at current growth rates, 5
billion people \-- about 70 percent of the world\'s population \-- will
be connected in five years. But this growth trajectory is not
inevitable, and [**threats are mounting to the global spread of an open
and truly \"worldwide\" web. The [expansion of the open Internet]{.mark}
must be allowed to continue: The mobile and social media revolutions
[are critical]{.mark} not only for democratic institutions\' ability
[to]{.mark}** **[solve]{.mark} the [collective problems of a shrinking
world]{.mark}, but also to a dynamic and innovative global economy that
depends on financial transparency and the free flow of
information.**]{.underline} The threats to the open Internet were on
stark display at last December\'s World Conference on International
Telecommunications in Dubai, where the United States fought attempts by
a number of countries \-- including Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia \--
to give a U.N. organization, the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU), new regulatory authority over the Internet. Ultimately, over the
objection of the United States and many others, 89 countries voted to
approve a treaty that could strengthen the power of governments to
control online content and deter broadband deployment. In Dubai, two
deeply worrisome trends came to a head. First, we see that the Arab
Spring and similar events have **[awakened nondemocratic governments to
the danger that the Internet poses to their regimes. In Dubai, they
pushed for a treaty that would give the ITU\'s imprimatur to
governments\' blocking or favoring of online content under the guise of
preventing spam and increasing network security. [Authoritarian
countries\']{.mark} real [goal is to legitimize content
regulation,]{.mark} opening the door for governments to block any
content they do not like, such as political speech. Second, [the
basic]{.mark} commercial [model underlying the open Internet is]{.mark}
also [under threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In particular, some
proposals, like the one made last year by major European network
operators, would change the ground rules for payments for transferring
Internet content. One species of these proposals is called \"sender
pays\" or \"sending party pays.\" Since the beginning of the Internet,
content creators \-- individuals, news outlets, search engines, social
media sites \-- have been able to make their content available to
Internet users without paying a fee to Internet service providers. A
sender-pays rule would change that, empowering governments to require
Internet content creators to pay a fee to connect with an end user in
that country. Sender pays may look merely like a commercial issue, a
different way to divide the pie. And proponents of sender pays and
similar changes claim they would benefit Internet deployment and
Internet users. But the opposite is true: If a country imposed a payment
requirement, content creators would be less likely to serve that
country. The loss of content would make the Internet less attractive and
would lessen demand for the deployment of Internet infrastructure in
that country. Repeat the process in a few more countries, [**and the
growth of global connectivity \-- as well as its attendant benefits for
democracy \-- would slow dramatically. So too would the benefits
accruing** **to the global economy**]{.underline}. Without continuing
improvements in transparency and information sharing, the **[[innovation
that springs from new commercial ideas and creative breakthroughs is
sure to be severely inhibited.]{.mark} To their credit, American
Internet service providers have joined with the broader U.S. technology
industry, civil society, and others in opposing these changes. Together,
we were able to win the battle in Dubai over sender pays, but we have
not yet won the war. Issues affecting global Internet openness,
broadband deployment, and free speech will return in upcoming
international forums]{.underline}**, including an important meeting in
Geneva in May, the World Telecommunication/ICT Policy Forum. The massive
investment in wired and wireless broadband infrastructure in the United
States demonstrates that preserving an open Internet is completely
compatible with broadband deployment. According to a recent UBS report,
annual wireless capital investment in the United States increased 40
percent from 2009 to 2012, while investment in the rest of the world has
barely inched upward. And according to the Information Technology and
Innovation Foundation, more fiber-optic cable was laid in the United
States in 2011 and 2012 than in any year since 2000, and 15 percent more
than in Europe. All Internet users lose something when some countries
are cut off from the World Wide Web. Each person who is unable to
connect to the Internet diminishes our own access to information. We
become less able to understand the world and formulate policies to
respond to our shrinking planet. Conversely, we gain a richer
understanding of global events as more people connect around the world,
and those societies nurturing nascent democracy movements become more
familiar with America\'s traditions of free speech and pluralism.
That\'s why we believe that the Internet should remain free of
gatekeepers and that no entity \-- public or private \-- should be able
to pick and choose the information web users can receive. That is a
principle the United States adopted in the Federal Communications
Commission\'s 2010 Open Internet Order. And it\'s why we are deeply
concerned about arguments by some in the United States that broadband
providers should be able to block, edit, or favor Internet traffic that
travels over their networks, or adopt economic models similar to
international sender pays. We must preserve the Internet as the most
open and robust platform for the free exchange of information ever
devised. Keeping the Internet open is perhaps the most important free
speech issue of our time.

Many **[great [civilisations have fallen]{.mark}]{.underline}**, leaving
nothing but cracked ruins and scattered genetics. Usually this results
**[[from: natural disasters, resource depletion, economic meltdown,
disease, poor information flow and corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
But we're luckier than our predecessors because **[we command a
technology that no one else possessed: a rapid communication network
that finds its highest expression in the internet]{.underline}**. I
propose that there are six ways in which **[[the net]{.mark} has [vastly
reduced]{.mark} the [threat of societal collapse. Epidemics can be
deflected]{.mark} by telepresence]{.underline}** One of our more dire
prospects for collapse is an infectious-disease epidemic[**. Viral and
bacterial epidemics precipitated the fall of t**he Golden Age of
**Athens,**]{.underline} the Roman Empire and most of the empires of the
Native Americans. **[The internet can be our key to survival because the
[ability to work telepresently can inhibit microbial
transmission]{.mark} by reducing human-to-human contact]{.underline}**.
In the face of an otherwise devastating epidemic, businesses can keep
supply chains running with the maximum number of employees working from
home. This can reduce host density below the tipping point required for
an epidemic. **[If we are well prepared when an epidemic arrives, [we
can fluidly shift into a self-quarantined society]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in which microbes fail due to host scarcity. Whatever the social ills of
isolation, they are worse for the microbes than for us. **[[The internet
will predict natural disasters]{.mark} We are witnessing the downfall of
slow central control in the media]{.underline}**: news stories are
increasingly becoming user-generated nets of up-to-the-minute
information. **[During the recent California wildfires,]{.underline}**
locals went to the TV stations to learn whether their neighbourhoods
were in danger. But the news stations appeared most concerned with the
fate of celebrity mansions, so Californians changed their tack: they
uploaded geotagged mobile-phone pictures, updated Facebook statuses and
tweeted. The balance tipped: **[the internet carried news about the fire
more quickly and accurately than any news station could.]{.underline}**
In this grass-roots, decentralised scheme, there were embedded reporters
on every block, and the news shockwave kept ahead of the fire. This head
start could provide the extra hours that save us. If the Pompeiians had
had the internet in 79AD, they could have easily marched 10km to safety,
well ahead of the pyroclastic flow from Mount Vesuvius. **[If the Indian
Ocean had the Pacific's networked tsunami-warning system, South-East
Asia would look quite different today]{.underline}. [Discoveries are
retained and shared]{.underline}** Historically, **[critical information
has required constant rediscovery]{.underline}**. Collections of
learning \-- from the library at Alexandria to the entire Minoan
civilisation \-- have fallen to the bonfires of invaders or the wrecking
ball of natural disaster. Knowledge is hard won but easily lost. And
information that survives often does not spread. **[Consider smallpox
inoculation]{.underline}**: this was under way in India, China and
Africa centuries before it made its way to Europe**[. By the time the
idea reached North America, native civilisations who needed it had
already collapsed]{.underline}. [The net solved the problem. New
discoveries catch on immediately;]{.underline}** information spreads
widely. In this way, societies can optimally ratchet up, using the
latest bricks of knowledge in their fortification against risk.
**[Tyranny is mitigated]{.underline} [Censorship of ideas]{.underline}**
was a familiar spectre in the last century, with state-approved news
outlets ruling the press, airwaves and copying machines **[in the
USSR]{.underline}**, Romania, Cuba, China, Iraq **[and
elsewhere]{.underline}**. In many cases, such as Lysenko's agricultural
despotism in the USSR, it **[directly contributed to the collapse of the
nation]{.underline}**. Historically**[, a more successful strategy has
been to confront free speech with free speech \-- and the internet
allows this in a natural way.]{.underline}** It democratises the flow of
information by offering access to the newspapers of the world, the
photographers of every nation, the bloggers of every political stripe.
Some posts are full of doctoring and dishonesty whereas others strive
for independence and impartiality \-- but all are available to us to
sift through. Given the attempts by some governments to build firewalls,
it's clear that this benefit of the net requires constant vigilance.
**[[Human capital is vastly increased]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Crowdsourcing brings people together to solve problems.]{.underline}**
Yet far fewer than one per cent of the world's population is involved.
We need expand human capital. Most of the world not have access to the
education afforded a small minority. For every Albert Einstein, Yo-Yo Ma
or Barack Obama who has educational opportunities, uncountable others do
not. This squandering of talent translates into reduced economic output
and a smaller pool of problem solvers. **[[The net opens]{.mark} the
gates [education to anyone with a computer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A
motivated teen anywhere on the planet can walk through the world's
knowledge \-- from the webs of Wikipedia to the curriculum of MIT's
OpenCourseWare**[. The new [human capital will serve us well when we
confront existential threats we've never imagined]{.mark} before. Energy
expenditure is reduced]{.underline}** Societal collapse can often be
understood in terms of an energy budget: **[when energy spend outweighs
energy return, collapse ensues]{.underline}**. This has taken the form
of deforestation or soil erosion; **[currently, the worry involves
fossil-fuel depletion. The internet addresses the energy problem with a
natural ease]{.underline}**. Consider the massive energy savings
inherent in the shift from paper to electrons \-- as seen in the
transition from the post to email. **[Ecommerce reduces the need to
drive long distances to purchase products]{.underline}. [Delivery trucks
are more eco-friendly]{.underline}** than individuals driving around,
not least because of tight packaging and optimisation algorithms for
driving routes. Of course, there are energy costs to the banks of
computers that underpin the internet \-- but these costs are less than
the wood, coal and oil that would be expended for the same quantity of
information flow. **[[The tangle of events that triggers societal
collapse can be complex]{.mark},]{.underline}** and there are several
threats the net does not address. **[But [vast, networked communication
can be an antidote to]{.mark} several of the most [deadly diseases
threatening civilisation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The next time your
coworker laments internet addiction, the banality of tweeting or the
decline of face-to-face conversation, you may want to suggest that the

#### Executive power risks [Iran war]{.underline}

**Niles and Reich 12** -- Niles, Emma, and Robert Reich. "War Power
Abuse Makes Iran Conflict More Likely." Truthdig, 1 Oct. 2012,
[www.truthdig.com/articles/war-power-abuse-makes-iran-conflict-more-likely/](http://www.truthdig.com/articles/war-power-abuse-makes-iran-conflict-more-likely/)

Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., along with retired military officers Col.
Lawrence Wilkerson and Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer as well as former
Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Fein denounced President Barack
Obama at a news conference Sept. 21 for overstepping his authority in
wartime and warned that unless war powers are restored to Congress, the
country could soon be involved in a battle with Iran. The resolution
comes at a time when tensions among Iran, the United States and Israel
have intensified and could lead to what Col. Wilkerson described as an
eruption of catastrophic violence in the Middle East. Resolution HRC107,
written by Jones and supported by 13 House members, is the latest
attempt to restore one of the fundamental constitutional powers to
Congress. The retired military officers and congressman told a small
gathering of reporters **[that the [unchecked power of the imperial
presidency]{.mark}, which began in earnest under the Truman
administration, [has expanded its authority under Obama to order the
assassination of U.S. citizens and wage proxy wars in Libya, Pakistan,
Yemen and Somalia without seeking congressional approval]{.mark}. They
said they fear that [unless this power is restored to Congress the
country could find itself in a conflict with Iran.]{.mark} "The most
recent disclosures in The New York Times, not at all refuted by the
Obama administration, show that [the president claims and exercises
authority to surveil every ... individual on the planet,"]{.mark} Fein
said. "If he says, '[You're an imminent danger to the United States,'
you get vaporized. Predator drone. Any judicial review? No. Any
congressional review? No. Any disclosure of the profile of the
intelligence that justifies the finding you're one of the terrorists
we're going to vaporize? No."]{.mark}]{.underline}** This is "a
combination of legislative, executive, judicial power, plus being
executioner, all in one man!" Fein described the pursuit of ceaseless
military expansion and conquest as a "macho thrill." The British, he
pointed out, also expanded their empire beyond its ability to sustain
itself, a pattern the United States was now repeating[. He said that
[empires eventually grow beyond the control of the public or
politicians.]{.mark} The congressman and former officials argued [that
the power to declare and wage war must be]{.mark} wrested from the hands
of the president and [restored to Congress. "This is a natural evolution
of power]{.mark}]{.underline}," Wilkerson said. "This is what was going
to happen as soon as Harry Truman, on the 26th of July, put his
signature to the 1947 National Security Act. George Marshall looked at
the president, perhaps the most iconic military figure other than George
Washington in American history ... and said, 'Mr. President, I fear we
have militarized the decision-making process.' " Wilkerson was Colin
Powell's chief of staff when Powell, then secretary of state, delivered
his Iraq address to the United Nations in 2003. He helped Powell with
the presentation, making the case for war. He now says that the speech
was "the lowest point in my life." He has become one of the nation's
harshest critics of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and says that a
system that permits an imperial presidency to declare war is "tantamount
to tyranny." He said that in the last decade, the United States has
killed well over 300,000 people, although the country faces "no
existential threat." "Those 300,000 killings," Fein said, "are murder.
Because legal war makes what's customarily murder, legal. But if you're
not at war legally, those are homicides." The retired military officers
said they estimated that a war with Iran would plunge the United States
into a conflict that would last at least a decade and cost about \$3
trillion. Wilkerson, who spent 31 years in the military, warned that a
war with Iran could spread beyond the Middle East: "I could paint you a
scenario where we start a NATO no-fly zone over Syria, and wind up, in a
year or two, with a general regional war, and then, within a year or two
of that, possibly lots of big players fighting each other, first through
surrogates, and then their own troops. "I wouldn't be surprised to see
the Russians ... begin to sell their most sophisticated air defense
missiles to Syria. Then they're going to start shooting down NATO
airplanes; not one or two, but lots of them." Wilkerson likened the
current era to the years before World War I, adding grimly that the
primary difference is that today countries have nuclear arsenals.
["[Every empire in human history is gone,"]{.mark} he said. "Whether
it's the empire of the Khans, or the Thousand-Year Reich of Adolf
Hitler. They're gone. [Nowhere in the world is it written in stone that
the American empire is an exception.]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark}
Wilkerson said the implosion of the American empire would create chaos
and anarchy. "We're doing our level best to create that chaos and
anarchy right now," he said.

#### Escalates to WW3 -- draws in China

**PressTV 11** (Iranian publication, "China must protect Iran even with
WWIII," 12-4-11, <http://www.presstv.ir/detail/213760.html>)

**[[A professor from the Chinese National Defense University says if

program may consist of a covert military agenda. Iran has refuted the
allegations, saying that as a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation

nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. **[Over the past weeks,

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Iran\-\--A2: No Escalation

#### Iran lashout in response to war [triggers nuclear war]{.underline} 

**Ben-Meir 7**(Alon, commentator for the UPI, "Ending Iranian Defiance,"
February 6,
<http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Ending_Iranian_Defiance_999.html>)

**[That [Iran stands]{.mark}]{.underline}** today **[able [to
challenge]{.mark} or]{.underline}** even **[defy [the United
States]{.mark} in]{.underline}** every sphere of American influence in
**[the Middle East]{.underline}** attests to the dismal failure of the
Bush administration\'s policy toward it during the last six years.
**[[Feeling emboldened]{.mark} and unrestrained, [Tehran
may]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, **[[miscalculate]{.mark} the
consequences of its own actions, [which could precipitate a catastrophic
regional war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Bush administration has less
than a year to rein in Iran\'s reckless behavior if it hopes to prevent
such an ominous outcome and achieve, at least, a modicum of regional
stability. By all assessments, Iran has reaped the greatest benefits
from the Iraq war. The **[[war\'s consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and the American preoccupation with it have **[[provided Iran]{.mark}
with]{.underline}** an historic **[[opportunity to
establish]{.underline}]{.mark}** Shiite **[[dominance]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}** while aggressively pursuing a nuclear weapon
program to deter any challenge to its strategy. **[[Tehran is fully
cognizant]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the successful pursuit **[[of
its]{.mark} regional [hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}** has now become
intertwined with the clout that a nuclear program bestows. Therefore, it
is most unlikely that Iran will give up its nuclear ambitions at this
juncture, unless it concludes that the price will be too high to bear.
That is, whereas before the Iraq war Washington could deal with Iran\'s
nuclear program by itself, now the Bush administration must also
disabuse Iran of the belief that it can achieve its regional objectives
with impunity. Thus, while the administration attempts to stem the
Sunni-Shiite violence in Iraq to prevent it from engulfing other states
in the region, **[[Washington must also take a clear stand]{.mark} in
Lebanon]{.underline}**. Under no circumstances **[should Iranian-backed
Hezbollah]{.underline}** be allowed to **[topple the]{.underline}**
secular Lebanese **[government]{.underline}**. If this were to occur**[,
[it would trigger]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only a **[devastating civil
war]{.underline}** in Lebanon but **[a [wider
Sunni-Shiite]{.mark}]{.underline}** bloody
**[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Arab Sunni states, especially,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, are terrified of this possible outcome.
For them Lebanon may well provide the litmus test of the
administration\'s resolve to inhibit Tehran\'s adventurism but they must
be prepared to directly support U.S. efforts. In this regard, the Bush
administration must wean Syria from Iran. This move is of paramount
importance because not only could Syria end its political and logistical
support for Hezbollah, but it could return Syria, which is predominantly
Sunni, to the Arab-Sunni fold. President Bush must realize that
Damascus\' strategic interests are not compatible with Tehran\'s and the
Assad regime knows only too well its future political stability and
economic prosperity depends on peace with Israel and normal relations
with the United States. President Bashar Assad may talk tough and
embrace militancy as a policy tool; he is, however, the same president
who called, more than once, for unconditional resumption of peace
negotiation with Israel and was rebuffed. The stakes for the United
States and its allies in the region are too high to preclude testing
Syria\'s real intentions which can be ascertained only through direct
talks. It is high time for the administration to reassess its policy
toward Syria and begin by abandoning its schemes of regime change in
Damascus. Syria simply matters; the administration must end its efforts
to marginalize a country that can play such a pivotal role in changing
the political dynamic for the better throughout the region. Although
ideally direct negotiations between the United States and Iran should be
the first resort to resolve the nuclear issue, as long as Tehran does
not feel seriously threatened, it seems unlikely that the clergy will at
this stage end the nuclear program. In possession of nuclear weapons
**[[Iran will]{.underline}]{.mark}** intimidate the larger Sunni Arab
states in the region, **[bully smaller states into submission, [threaten
Israel]{.mark}\'s very existence, [use oil as a]{.mark} political
[weapon]{.mark} to blackmail the West [and instigate]{.mark} regional
[proliferation]{.mark} of nuclear weapons\' programs]{.underline}**. In
short, if unchecked, **[[Iran could plunge the Middle East into
a]{.mark} deliberate or [inadvertent nuclear
conflagration]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If we take the administration at
its word that it would not tolerate a nuclear Iran and considering these
regional implications, Washington is left with no choice but to warn
Iran of the severe consequences of not halting its nuclear program.

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Korea

#### Groupthink causes Korean war

**Gregg 13** -- Donald P. Gregg, Chair of the Pacific Century Institute,
Former National Security Advisor for Bush I, Former Ambassador to South
Korea, 4/12/13 (Korea Times, "President Obama\'s Edsel problem" Lexis)

How did that come about? Apparently in those days Detroit\'s engineers
were vulnerable to a virulent form of
**[[groupthink]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[produced
failure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not success. I fear that today President
**[Obama has a]{.underline}** sort of **[\'Edsel problem\' as far as his
North Korean policy is concerned.]{.underline}** Many **[Washington
policymakers focused on Korea have]{.underline}**, since the advent of
the George W. Bush administration, fallen victim to **[the [collective
belief]{.mark} that talking to North Korea would be a
form]{.underline}** of rewarding **[bad behavior on Pyongyang\'s part,
and]{.underline}** **[that [pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in terms of
sanctions and military threats **[[can wean North Korea away]{.mark}
from]{.underline}** its belief that **[developing nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** is the surest way to protect itself from U.S.
attacks. **[This policy has [failed]{.mark} totally, [but no one]{.mark}
in Washington [wants to say that]{.mark},]{.underline}** as such would
be a personal admission of past error, something fatal to future career
advancement. Secretary of State John **[Kerry]{.underline}**, powerfully
qualified for his new position, **[wants to bring fresh thinking to key
positions]{.underline}** such as Assistant Secretary of State for East
Asia and Pacific Affairs, **[but]{.underline}** this **[is being
resisted by the White]{.underline}** **[House]{.underline}**,
**[which]{.underline}** **[seems to believe that]{.underline}** perhaps
**[if we lean harder on China, Beijing will convince Pyongyang to accede
to our wishes. China]{.underline}** may be somewhat helpful in this way,
but **[will never push Pyongyang toward collapse, or regime
change,]{.underline}** which some in Washington still seek. **[In North
Korea, we are dealing with a new leadership convened by Kim Jong-un that
is prepared to change]{.underline}** the rules of a game that has led
nowhere for the past 60 years. To those viewing this dramatic change of
course from the outside, **[the [current]{.mark} North [Korean
leadership appears oblivious of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the selective
**[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}** shown at times by Kim Jong-un\'s
grandfather and father. These pundits, government officials and assorted
experts assert that **[Kim Jong-un is [taking]{.mark} his [country
rapidly into extremely dangerous waters]{.mark} with a degree of bluster
and threat that outstrips anything his forebears have produced. Defining
North Korea\'s change]{.underline}** of course **[in this partial
way]{.underline}** ­ that is solely in terms of Kim Jong-un\'s bizarre
performance - **[makes it easy for Washington
\'Edselians\']{.underline}** (to coin a phrase) **[to say \'We can\'t
talk to that guy]{.underline}**, he sends us messages carried by Dennis
Rodman.\' I think that the key player in this very fluid scene may be
President Park Geun-hye. I knew both her parents, and believe that she
has inherited her father\'s steely resolve and her mother\'s compassion.
She is now preparing to meet John Kerry, who plans a visit to Seoul
within a week. I have no idea what they will say to each other, but I
believe that they are both astute enough to recognize that more of the
same, i.e. more pressure and more sanctions, will not do the trick. For
those willing to listen, **[North Korea has made it clear that what it
wants to talk about is a peace process]{.underline}**, **[leading to a
peace treaty]{.underline}**. **[A [peace process needs]{.mark} a
foundation of [mutual trust]{.mark} upon which it can be constructed,
and [there is no trust]{.mark}]{.underline}** at all **[between
Washington and Pyongyang [at the moment]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
President Park calls her yet-to-be-designed North Korean policy
\'trustpolitik.\' That in itself is a step in the right direction. I
hope that the meeting in Seoul with Secretary Kerry can produce some
small forward steps, confidence building measures perhaps, that can be
discussed and fleshed out in May, when Presidents Park and Obama meet in
Washington. President **[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}** demonstrated the
powers of his personal involvement during his recent trip to the Middle
East. He has been wisely restrained in what he has said about the
current situation on the Korean peninsula. He
**[[needs]{.underline}]{.mark}** to become involved directly, with some
[**[fresh thinking.]{.underline}** **[More policy Edsels lead nowhere
but]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to]{.underline}** the potential tragedy of
a **[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[whose eternal epitaph would be
\'Why did we fight them when what they wanted was a peace
treaty?\']{.underline}**

#### Korea war goes nuclear -- US deterrence [failing now]{.underline} -- defense doesn't assume miscalc/accidents/inadvertent conflict, poor lines of communication, and destabilizing force postures

**Walsh 17** \-\-\-- Jim, Senior Research Associate (MIT's Security
Studies Program), former executive director of the Managing the Atom
project (Harvard University's JFK School of Government), Ph.D. from MIT,
"Is War Coming to North Korea?" Al Jazeera, 4/26,
http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/04/war-coming-north-korea-170426081658495.html

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** North [**[Korea are]{.underline}**
**[hurling threats]{.underline}**]{.mark} at one another. In Japan, the
sale of bomb shelters is booming. And in South Korea, a country that has
seen this all before and is typically nonplussed about a test or two,
citizens are feeling a bit anxious.

**[Could war]{.underline}** really **[break out]{.underline}** on the
Korean Peninsula? **[Could]{.underline}** a **[conventional war lead
to]{.underline}** the first use of **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**
since 1945? Is this actually for real?

Well, there is some good news and some bad news. But it has to be said,
the good news isn\'t that great and the bad news is potentially
horrific.

First, the good news. On average, big, ugly wars between major countries
don\'t happen very often. On any given day, the chance of a major war,
let alone a war involving nuclear weapons, is exceedingly small. On the
Korean Peninsula, that probability is reinforced by the fact that none
of the key players wants a war. North Korea doesn\'t want a war, because
it knows it will lose and lose decisively. That would mean the end of
the Kim dynasty, and if there\'s one thing Chairman Kim Jong-un wants,
it\'s to stay in power.

Most South Koreans are similarly allergic to the idea of a large-scale
conflict. Yes, **[North Korea would lose, but]{.underline}** along the
way, a sizeable chunk of **[Seoul]{.underline}**, the South Korean
capital and its most important economic centre, **[would
be]{.underline}** **[devastated]{.underline}** **[by]{.underline}**
North Korean **[artillery. [Even]{.mark} if the conflict ended
[without]{.mark}]{.underline}** the North getting **[a
conventional/[nuclear]{.mark}/chemical shot off, [it would]{.mark} still
be [ruinous]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[[South would face]{.mark}
a]{.underline}** human **[tidal wave]{.underline}** **[of
[refugees]{.mark}]{.underline}**, economic **[dislocation, [and
an]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[anxious]{.underline}**]{.mark}, defensive
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** worried about its border. And that\'s
if it went \"well\".

China doesn\'t want a war - not on its border, not with nuclear weapons
in play, not when its number one vital interest is political stability
and sufficient economic growth to keep a poor and potentially restive
population focused on dreams of a middle-class life. Japan?

There is nothing in it for Tokyo, except possibly stirring up
anti-Japanese feelings that have persisted since the end of World War
II. And the last thing Mr Donald Trump needs is a war, not with tens of
thousands of US troops in South Korea and Japan. His presidency would be
over before it had barely started.

**[So, no war, right?]{.underline}**

**[Not so fast.]{.underline}**

**[Unfortunately, [wars]{.mark} can [break out]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[even [when none]{.mark} of the parties [wants]{.mark} a
war]{.underline}**. **[[Leaders]{.mark} may be rational,]{.underline}**
yes **[even Kim]{.underline}** Jong-un, **[but]{.underline}**
**[that]{.underline}** **[doesn\'t mean they are perfect]{.underline}**.
**[They can]{.underline}** **[[miscalculate]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[likely response]{.underline}** of an adversary; they can **[misread
the situation; they can find themselves backed]{.underline}** into a
corner **[where the only \"rational\" choice]{.underline}** **[is to
fight]{.underline}**.

Those **[inadvertent or [accidental wars]{.mark} are]{.underline}** also
**[rare]{.underline}**, even less likely than wars fought on purpose,
**[but they can [happen]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And the
**[[Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**n Peninsula **[happens to be a place
where]{.underline}** many of the **[[conditions]{.mark}
for]{.underline}** such a **[conflict [are]{.mark}]{.underline}**
already [**[present]{.underline}**. **[Poor]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[lines of]{.underline}** **[[communication]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
little understanding of the adversary\'s intentions?
**[Check]{.underline}**. **[Lots of [bluster]{.mark} and
bluffing]{.underline}** by the parties? **[Double check]{.underline}**.
**[Military [doctrines and force postures]{.mark} that]{.underline}**
can **[[push]{.mark} small [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[up]{.mark} the ladder [to]{.mark} a [major
confrontation]{.mark}?]{.underline}** Again, **[check]{.underline}**.

North **[[Korea is]{.mark} the most isolated]{.underline}**, **[[least
understood]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[country]{.underline}** in the
world. The [**[US repeatedly misread]{.underline}** **[Soviet
intentions]{.underline}**]{.mark} during the Cold War, despite an
enormous effort that lasted for decades, **[and]{.underline}** my
**[conversations]{.underline}** with government officials in Washington,
Seoul, Beijing, and Tokyo **[give]{.underline}** me **[no reason to
believe]{.underline}** that **[we are doing]{.underline}** any **[better
with]{.underline}** North **[Korea]{.underline}**.

Of course, the **[North Koreans could tell]{.underline}** the **[US what
they want. They could communicate]{.underline}** their **[red
lines]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** the **[[US has no]{.mark}
formal]{.underline}** diplomatic **[[relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with the North Koreans **[and]{.underline}** **[rarely
talks]{.underline}** to them. And if the North Koreans told Washington
where those red lines are, would it believe them? How are we to
distinguish the over-the-top threats from the serious warnings?

And unfortunately, **[the [new]{.mark} US
[admin]{.mark}]{.underline}**istration **[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[its own [issues]{.mark}]{.underline}** in this regard.
**[[Between]{.underline}]{.mark}** late-night **[[tweets]{.mark},
contradictory statements]{.underline}** by the highest officials in the
US government, **[[and threats]{.mark} that are]{.underline}** clearly
**[bluffs]{.underline}**, **[[how should Pyongyang interpret US
\"signals\"?]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[Will]{.underline}** the
**[Kim]{.underline}** clan **[be able to discern when]{.underline}** the
**[Trump is serious]{.underline}** and when he is posturing? China can
act as a go-between, but one has to wonder what gets lost in
translation, especially when Beijing has its own interests and the
Chinese-North Korean relationship (never great to begin with) further
erodes in response to Chinese pressure.

**[Less well-understood but]{.underline}** perhaps [**[more
important]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[are doctrines and force
postures]{.underline}**. The **[[North is
outgunned]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and they know it. South Korean and US
forces are far more capable and have worked assiduously to be able to
hit every military asset in North Korea. If you are an American or South
Korean, that sounds like a good thing, until you realise how that looks
from Pyongyang.

**[If I were]{.underline}** Mr **[[Kim]{.mark} and I knew]{.underline}**
my **[enemies can take out what I have early]{.underline}** in a
conflict, **[I [would have]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[an itchy]{.mark}
trigger [finger]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Let\'s **[say]{.underline}**
**[there is an incident]{.underline}** or a murky report of an incident.
Is it nothing or is it the beginning of a much-discussed decapitation
strike? If he thinks it is the latter, Mr **[Kim may conclude
[he\'d]{.mark} better]{.underline}** **[go big]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[go fast]{.underline}**. **[He
w]{.underline}**ill, as they say, have to **[\"[use]{.mark} them [or
lose them\".]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Or **[what if Kim]{.underline}** waits, **[fights]{.underline}** a
**[conventional]{.underline}** war **[and]{.underline}** then
**[inevitably begins to lose]{.underline}**. **[[Popping]{.mark} a
[nuclear]{.mark} weapon off [to stave off]{.mark} regime [collapse will
be a powerful temptation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Perhaps he will think
that by just using one nuclear weapon in a limited way, he can force the
US and South Korea to halt their advance or perhaps force a Chinese
intervention that would freeze the situation in place. But
**[maybe]{.underline}** the **[[Americans]{.mark} and South
Koreans]{.underline}** don\'t get the message. Maybe they think they\'d
better [**[escalate in response]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

So **[yes, [it is possible]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[no government
wants]{.mark} a [war]{.mark},]{.underline}**
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[they
chose]{.underline}]{.mark}** war, even **[[nuclear]{.mark}
war]{.underline}**, **[[because it is]{.mark} the \"[rational]{.mark}\"
option]{.underline}** under extreme circumstances.

The good news is that this is unlikely. The bad news is that it is
possible, and the result will be far worse than anyone can possibly
imagine.

\*\*\*modified for ableist language

The entire episode shows just how **[precarious the situation remains
between the Koreas. In the event of a war, [North]{.mark} Korea
[would]{.mark}]{.underline}** most **[likely [be overthrown]{.mark}
by]{.underline}** the **[combined forces of South Korea and the US, [but
not before Kim]{.mark}]{.underline}** Jong Un and his military
**[[would]{.mark} be able to [do]{.mark} some [serious
damage]{.mark}]{.underline}** to North Korea\'s southern neighbor. Harry
J. Kazianis, writing for The National Interest, notes that the
**[[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark}** regime **[has five [weapons]{.mark} that
could [cause mass fatalities and]{.mark} sow [extreme panic]{.mark}
throughout South Korea and]{.underline}** even possibly in **[the
US.]{.underline}** Firstly, **[Kazianis notes]{.underline}** that
**[[Pyongyang could use dirty bombs]{.underline}]{.mark}** against South
Korea. **[North Korea is known to have dug tunnels]{.underline}**
beneath the demilitarized zone that divides the peninsula. North Korean
**[operatives could sneak [through]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[tunnels]{.mark} carrying the materials necessary to plant dirty
bombs in major cities throughout the South. Additionally]{.underline}**,
Kazianis writes, **[[North]{.mark} Korea [could]{.mark} simply [place
raw]{.mark} nuclear [material on a]{.mark} short-range [rocket]{.mark}
bound [for Seoul]{.mark}. [Even if
inaccurate]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} **[the [weapon]{.mark} would
still [cause mass panic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Secondly,
**[[North]{.mark} Korea [could bring]{.mark}]{.underline}** to bear
**[[chemical and biological weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[against
South Korea.]{.underline}** The **[Nuclear Threat Initiative
notes]{.underline}** that **[[Pyongyang]{.underline}]{.mark}** most
**[likely [has]{.mark} the [third-largest
stockpile]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[of chemical weapons]{.mark} on the
planet, including various nerve agents]{.underline}**. Additionally,
**[a North Korean [defector]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Finland **[brought
15 gigabytes of data]{.underline}** **[that [showed Pyongyang
tested]{.mark} chemical and biological [agents]{.mark}]{.underline}** on
its own citizens. **[North Korea]{.underline}** has **[also released
images in which [Kim]{.mark} is]{.underline}** seen
**[touring]{.underline}** **[the Pyongyang Bio-technical Institute,
which is]{.underline}** intended to produce fertilizer. Numerous weapons
experts, however, have said the facility is probably **[a cover and
[can]{.mark} instead [produce anthrax]{.mark} on a military
level]{.underline}**. **[The third extremely dangerous tool
[North]{.mark} Korea [could]{.mark} use]{.underline}** in a war **[would
be a [nuclear strike]{.mark} against Alaska or
[Hawaii]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[success]{.underline}** of any
strike **[is a definite long shot]{.underline}**, Kazianis says, **[but
[it could be increasingly plausible]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the coming
decades. **[[North]{.mark} Korea has [spent tremendous capital]{.mark}
on]{.underline}** both **[its nuclear- and ballistic-missile
programs]{.underline}** and, in the event of a nuclear strike, the
success would not be measured by the number of casualties as much as by
the mayhem it could cause. In April, Adm. Bill
**[Gortney]{.underline}**, the general in charge of North American
Aerospace Defense Command (Norad), **[said]{.underline}** at a Pentagon
news conference that **[North Korea had \"the ability to put a nuclear
weapon on a KN-08 and shoot it at the homeland]{.underline}**.\"
Gortney, however, did qualify his statement by saying he was confident
that US missile defense would be able to down any incoming North Korean
missile before it struck. Fourthly, **[[North]{.mark} Korea could [cause
extreme damage]{.mark}]{.underline}** against South Korea simply
**[[with]{.mark} conventional artillery]{.underline}**. The
**[Kim]{.underline}** regime **[has the [world\'s largest artillery
force]{.mark}, with]{.underline}** about **[10,000 active pieces, all of
which are aimed directly at Seoul]{.underline}**. **[Though a vast
majority]{.underline}** of these weapons **[may not
function]{.underline}** properly or may be incapable of hitting Seoul
because of a lack of maintenance and their old age, **[the barrage is
still enough to spread mass panic and cause a huge number of civilian
casualties. [North]{.mark} Korea\'s last major lethal
weapon]{.underline}**, according to Kazianis, **[is its

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Testing

#### Unchecked prez powers allow [military testing on human subjects]{.underline}

Law, former counsel to Senator Russell Feingold, J.D. from Yale Law
School, 2019 ("The Alarming Scope of the President\'s Emergency Powers,"

Like all emergency powers**[, [the laws governing]{.mark} the conduct of
[war allow the president to engage in conduct that would be
illegal]{.mark} during ordinary times. [This]{.mark} conduct [includes
familiar incidents of war, such as]{.mark} the [killing or indefinite
detention of]{.mark} enemy [soldiers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But the
president can also take a host of other actions, both abroad and inside
the United States.

These laws vary dramatically in content and scope. **[[Several of them
authorize the president to make decisions]{.mark} about the size and
composition of the armed forces [that are usually left to
Congress.]{.mark} Although [such measures]{.mark} can offer needed
flexibility at crucial moments, they [are subject to
misuse]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, George W. **[[Bush
leveraged]{.mark} the state of emergency after [9/11 to call hundreds of
thousands of reservists]{.mark} and members of the National Guard
[into]{.mark} activ[e duty]{.mark} in Iraq[, for a war that had nothing
to do with the]{.mark} 9/11 [attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Other
powers are chilling under any circumstances: Take a moment to consider
that during a declared war or national emergency, **[[the president
can]{.mark} unilaterally [suspend the law that bars]{.mark} government
[testing of biological and chemical agents on]{.mark} [unwitting human
subjects.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### The status quo causes [international pandemics]{.underline} -- the international link is not just the effect of experimentation but the societal collapse of trust in doctors

Finally, banning the practice of **[[human research]{.mark} without
consent is of mutual concern to states, as these [regulations play a
major role]{.mark} in [reducing]{.mark} the [cross-border]{.mark} spread
of [disease]{.mark}, and [countries]{.mark} have [faced]{.mark} public
health [emergencies when public trust with the medical community has
broken down]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Second Circuit in Pfizer
recounted the effects of the community distrust that existed after the
medical experimentation that the case itself was addressing. After the
nonconsensual medical trials by Pfizer, there was such distrust of the
medical establishment in the local population in Nigeria that there was
a local boycott of a polio vaccination campaign in 2004, leading to an
international health crises. The polio originating in Nigeria triggered
a major international outbreak, spreading across west, central, and
southern Africa and the Middle East, re-infecting twenty previously
polio-free countries. **[The requirement of [consent]{.mark} in medical
practices [is]{.mark} clearly [of universal
concern]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### [Diseases]{.underline} cause [extinction]{.underline}\-\--novel pathogens create [anti-genic]{.underline} mutations that undermine [exogenous]{.underline} shocks

**Pamlin 15** --- Dennis Pamlin, Stuart Armstrong, February 2015,

Here only worldwide events are included. A widespread endemic disease
that is stable in terms of how many people become sick from it is not
**[a pandemic]{.underline}**. 260 3.1.4.1 Expected impact Infectious
diseases have been one of the greatest causes of mortality in history.
Unlike many other global challenges pandemics have happened recently, as
we can see where reasonably good data exist. Plotting **[[historic
epidemic fatalities]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a log scale reveals that
these tend to follow a power law with a small exponent: many plagues
have been found to follow a power law with exponent 0.26.261
**[[These]{.mark} kinds of [power laws are
heavy-tailed]{.mark}]{.underline}**262 **[[to a significant
degree]{.mark}.]{.underline}**263 In consequence most of the fatalities
are accounted for by the top few events.264 If this law holds for future
pandemics as well,265 then the majority of people who will die from
epidemics will likely die from the single largest pandemic. Most
epidemic fatalities follow a power law, with some extreme events -- such
as the Black Death and Spanish Flu -- being even more deadly.267 There
are other grounds for suspecting that such **[[a high impact epidemic
will have a greater probability than]{.underline}]{.mark}** usually
**[[assumed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** All the **[features of an extremely
devastating disease]{.underline}** already **[exist in
nature:]{.underline}** essentially incurable (Ebola268), nearly always
**[fatal]{.underline}** (rabies269), extremely
**[infectious]{.underline}** (common cold270), **[and]{.underline}**
long **[incubation periods]{.underline}** (HIV271). **[If a pathogen
were to emerge that]{.underline}** somehow **[combine]{.underline}**d
**[these features (and]{.underline}** influenza has demonstrated
**[antigenic shift]{.underline}**, the ability to combine features from
different viruses272), its death toll would be extreme. Many relevant
features of the world have changed considerably, making past comparisons
problematic. The modern world has better sanitation and medical
research, as well as national and supra-national institutions dedicated
to combating diseases. Private insurers are also interested in modelling
pandemic risks.273 Set against this is the fact that **[[modern]{.mark}
[transport and dense]{.mark} human [population allow infections to
spread]{.mark} much]{.underline}** more rapidly274, and **[[there is the
potential for urban slums to serve as breeding
grounds]{.underline}]{.mark}** for disease.275 Unlike events such as
nuclear wars, pandemics would not damage the world's infrastructure, and
initial survivors would likely be resistant to the infection. And there
would probably be survivors, if only in isolated locations. Hence the
risk of a **[[civilisation collapse would come from the ripple
effect]{.mark} of the fatalities]{.underline}** and the policy
responses. These would include political and agricultural disruption as
well as economic dislocation and damage to the world's trade network
(including the food trade). **[[Extinction risk
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** only **[[possible]{.mark} if the
aftermath]{.underline}** of the epidemic fragments and diminishes human
society to the extent that recovery becomes impossible277 before
humanity succumbs to other risks (such as climate change or further
pandemics).

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Testing\-\--A2: No Extinction

#### Extinction\-\--defense is wrong 

Piers **Millett 17**, Consultant for the World Health Organization, PhD

Snyder-Beattie, "Existential Risk and Cost-Effective Biosecurity",
Health Security, Vol 15(4),
<http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/hs.2017.0028>

Historically, **[[disease events]{.mark} [have been responsible for the
greatest death tolls]{.mark} on humanity. The 1918 flu was responsible
for more than 50 million deaths]{.underline}**,1 while **[smallpox
killed perhaps 10 times that many in the 20th century
alone.]{.underline}**2 **[The Black Death was responsible for killing
over 25% of the European population]{.underline}**,3 while **[other
pandemics]{.underline}**, such as the plague of Justinian, **[are
thought to have killed 25 million]{.underline}** in the 6th
century---constituting over 10% of the world's population at the time.4
It is an open question whether **[a [future pandemic could]{.mark}
[result in]{.mark} outright [human extinction]{.mark} or the
irreversible collapse of civilization]{.underline}**.

**[[A skeptic would have]{.underline}]{.mark}** many good **[[reasons to
think]{.mark} that [existential risk]{.mark} from disease [is unlikely.
Such a disease would need to spread worldwide]{.mark} to remote
populations, overcome]{.underline}** rare **[genetic resistances, [and
evade detection]{.mark}]{.underline}**, cures, and countermeasures. Even
evolution itself may work in humanity's favor: **[[Virulence and
transmission is]{.mark} often [a trade-off]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
so evolutionary pressures could push against maximally lethal wild-type
pathogens.5,6

While **[[these arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}** point to a very small
risk of human extinction, **[they [do not rule the possibility
out]{.mark}]{.underline}** entirely. Although rare, **[[there are
recorded instances of species going extinct due to
disease]{.underline}]{.mark}**---primarily in amphibians, but also in 1
mammalian species of rat on Christmas Island.7,8 There **[are also
[historical examples of large human populations being]{.mark} almost
entirely [wiped out]{.mark} by disease, [especially when multiple
diseases were simultaneously introduced]{.mark} into a
population]{.underline}** without immunity. The most striking examples
of total population collapse include native American tribes exposed to
European diseases, such as the Massachusett (86% loss of population),
Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of population), and theWestern Abenaki
(which suffered a staggering 98% loss of population).

In the modern context, no single disease currently exists that combines
the worst-case levels of transmissibility, lethality, resistance to
countermeasures, and global reach. But **[many diseases are proof of
principle that each worst-case attribute can be realized
independently.]{.underline}** For example, **[[some diseases
exhibit]{.mark} nearly a [100%]{.mark} case [fatality]{.mark} ratio in
the absence of treatment]{.underline}**, such as rabies or septicemic
plague**[. [Other diseases have a track record of spreading to]{.mark}
virtually [every]{.mark} human [community
worldwide]{.mark},]{.underline}** such as the 1918 flu,10 and
**[seroprevalence studies indicate that other pathogens,]{.underline}**
such as chickenpox and HSV-1**[, can successfully reach over 95% of a
population]{.underline}**.11,12 **[Under optimal virulence theory,
natural evolution would be an unlikely source for pathogens with the
highest possible levels of transmissibility]{.underline}**, virulence,
and global reach. **[But [advances in biotech]{.mark}nology [might allow
the creation of diseases that combine]{.mark} such
[traits]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Recent controversy has already emerged
over a number of scientific experiments that resulted in viruses with
enhanced transmissibility, lethality, and/or the ability to overcome
therapeutics.13-17 Other experiments demonstrated that mousepox could be
modified to have a 100% case fatality rate and render a vaccine
ineffective.18 In addition to transmissibility and lethality, **[studies
have shown that other disease traits, such as incubation time,
environmental survival, and available vectors, could be
modifie]{.underline}**d as well.19-2

2\. **[Pandemic [diseases threaten humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}**

One possibility is the disgruntled individual who might create or steal
a virus and travel around the world releasing it

**[Natural and engineered pandemic disease is one of the most-studied
global risks. It is an area given new urgency by the controversy over
\"gain of function\" experiments. These involve taking a known pathogen
and adding extra, risky functionality]{.underline}**. For example, **[in
2011, virologists]{.underline}** Ron Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka
**[created a strain of the bird flu virus that could be transmitted
between ferrets]{.underline}**. This was done in order to better
understand the conditions in which the virus might develop
transmitability in the wild. Such experiments can head off certain risks
but create an arguably greater one, in that **[[the modified organism
might escape]{.mark} the lab [and cause a global
pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[The risk]{.mark} here [is]{.mark} particularly [great]{.mark}
because [it is self-replicating]{.mark}. Whereas a nuclear explosion is
localised, [in our highly connected world a synthetic, incurable virus
could spread around the planet in days]{.mark}. In the past, [natural
pandemics]{.mark} such as the black death [have killed millions]{.mark}
and effected wholesale social changes. In the 21st century[, advanced

We fear **[[it is only a matter of time]{.mark} before]{.underline}**
**[we face a deadlier and more contagious pathogen, yet the threat of a
deadly pandemic remains dangerously overlooked]{.underline}**.
**[[Pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}** now **[[occur with great]{.mark}er

**[[H]{.underline}]{.mark}**ealth
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization **[and potentially massive cuts
to funding for U.S.]{.underline}** scientific **[research]{.underline}**
and foreign aid, including funding for the United Nations, **[stand to
[deepen our vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[We
also]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[face]{.mark} the specter of [novel and
mutated pathogens that could spread and kill faster than]{.mark}
diseases we have seen [before]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the advent of
genome-editing technologies, bioterrorists could artificially engineer
new plagues, a threat that Ashton Carter, the former U.S. secretary of
defense, thinks could **[[rival nuclear weapons in
deadliness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The two of us have advised the
president of Guinea on stopping Ebola. In addition, we have worked on
ways to contain the spread of Zika and have informally advised U.S. and
international organizations on the matter. **[Our experiences tell us
that the world is unprepared for these threats]{.underline}**. We
urgently need to change this trajectory. We can start by learning four
lessons from the gaps exposed by the Ebola and Zika pandemics. Faster
Vaccine Development The most effective way to stop pandemics is with
vaccines. However, with Ebola there was no vaccine, and only now, years
later, has one proven effective. This has been the case with Zika, too.
Though there has been rapid progress in developing and getting a vaccine
to market, it is not fast enough, and Zika has already spread worldwide.
Many other diseases do not have vaccines, and developing them takes too
long when a pandemic is already under way. We need faster pipelines,
such as the one that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
is trying to create, to preemptively develop vaccines for diseases
predicted to cause outbreaks in the near future. Point-of-Care
Diagnostics Even with such efforts, vaccines will not be ready for many
diseases and would not even be an option for novel or artificially
engineered pathogens. With no vaccine for Ebola, our next best strategy
was to identify who was infected as quickly as possible and isolate them
before they infected others. Because Ebola's symptoms were identical to
common illnesses like malaria, diagnosis required laboratory testing
that could not be easily scaled. As a result, many patients were only
tested after several days of being contagious and infecting others. Some
were never tested at all, and about 40% of patients in Ebola treatment
centers did not actually have Ebola. Many dangerous pathogens similarly
require laboratory testing that is difficult to scale. Florida, for
example, has not been able to expand testing for Zika, so pregnant women
wait weeks to know if their babies might be affected. What's needed are
point-of-care diagnostics that, like pregnancy tests, can be used by
frontline responders or patients themselves to detect infection right
away, where they live. These tests already exist for many diseases, and
the technology behind them is well-established. However, the process for
their validation is slow and messy. Point-of-care diagnostics for Ebola,
for example, were available but never used because of such bottlenecks.
Greater Global Coordination **[We need stronger global
coordination]{.underline}**. The **[[responsibility]{.mark} for
controlling pandemics [is fragmented,]{.mark} spread across too many
players [with no unifying authority]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In Guinea we
forged a response out of an amalgam of over 30 organizations, each of
which had its own priorities. **[In Ebola's aftermath, there have been
calls for a mechanism for responding to pandemics similar to the advance
planning and training that NATO has in place for its numerous members to
respond to military threats in a quick, coordinated
fashion]{.underline}**. This is the right thinking, but we are far from
seeing it happen. The errors that allowed Ebola to become a crisis
replayed with Zika, and the **[[WHO]{.mark}, which should anchor global
action, continues to [suffer from a lack of
credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Stronger Local Health Systems
**[[International actors]{.mark} are essential but [cannot]{.mark}
parachute into countries and [navigate local dynamics quickly
enough]{.mark} to contain outbreaks]{.underline}**. In Guinea it took
months to establish the ground game needed to stop the pandemic, with
Ebola continuing to spread in the meantime. We need to help developing
countries establish health systems that can provide routine care and,
when needed, coordinate with international responders to contain new
outbreaks. Local health systems could be established for about half of
the \$3.6 billion ultimately spent on creating an Ebola response from
scratch. **[Access to routine care is also essential]{.underline}** for
knowing when an outbreak is taking root and establishing trust. For
months, Ebola spread before anyone knew it was happening, and then
lingered because communities who had never had basic health care doubted
the intentions of foreigners flooding into their villages. The turning
point in the pandemic came when they began to trust what they were
hearing about Ebola and understood what they needed to do to halt its
spread: identify those exposed and safely bury the dead. **[With Ebola
and Zika, we lacked]{.underline}** these four things --- vaccines,
diagnostics, **[global coordination, and local health systems --- which
are still urgently needed]{.underline}**. However, prevailing political
headwinds in **[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**,
which **[has [played a key role in combatting pandemics]{.mark} around
the world]{.underline}**, threaten to make things worse. The Trump
administration is seeking drastic budget cuts in funding for foreign aid
and scientific research. The U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for
International Development may lose over one-third of their budgets,
including half of the funding the U.S. usually provides to the UN. The
National Institutes of Health, which has been on the vanguard of
vaccines and diagnostics research, may also face cuts. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, which has been at the forefront of
responding to outbreaks, remains without a director, and, if the
Affordable Care Act is repealed, would lose \$891 million, 12% of its
overall budget, provided to it for immunization programs, monitoring and
responding to outbreaks, and other public health initiatives.
**[Investing in our ability to prevent and contain pandemics through
revitalized national]{.underline}** and international
**[institutions]{.underline}** **[should be our]{.underline}** shared
**[goal]{.underline}**. However, if U.S. agencies become less able to
respond to pandemics, leading institutions from other nations, such as
Institut Pasteur and the National Institute of Health and Medical
Research in France, the Wellcome Trust and London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine in the UK, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs
have done instrumental research and response work in previous
pandemics), would need to step in to fill the void. There is no border
wall against disease. **[Pandemics are [an existential threat on par
with climate change and nuclear conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We are
at a critical crossroads, where we must either take the steps needed to
prepare for this threat or become even more vulnerable. It is only a
matter of time before we are hit by a deadlier, more contagious
pandemic. Will we be ready?

#### Extinction

**Bar-Yam 16 --** Yaneer Bar-Yam, Founding President of the New England
Complex Systems Institute, "Transition to Extinction: Pandemics in a
Connected World," NECSI (July 3, 2016),
<http://necsi.edu/research/social/pandemics/transition>

Watch as one of the more aggressive---brighter red --- strains rapidly
expands. After a time it goes extinct leaving a black region. Why does
it go extinct? The answer is that it spreads so rapidly that it kills
the hosts around it. Without new hosts to infect it then dies out
itself. **[That the rapidly spreading pathogens die out has important
implications for evolutionary research]{.underline}** which we have
talked about elsewhere \[1--7\].

In the research I want to discuss here, **[what we were interested in is
the effect of adding long range transportation]{.underline}** \[8**[\].
This includes natural means of dispersal as well as unintentional
dispersal by humans, like adding airplane routes, which is being done by
real world airlines]{.underline}** (Figure 2).

**[When we introduce long range transportation into the model, the
success of more [aggressive strains]{.mark} changes. They can use the
long range transportation to [find]{.mark} new [hosts and escape]{.mark}
local extinction.]{.underline}** Figure 3 shows that the more
transportation routes introduced into the model, the more higher
aggressive pathogens are able to survive and spread.

As we add more long range transportation, **[there is a critical point
at which [pathogens become so aggressive]{.mark} that [the entire host
population dies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The pathogens die at the same
time, but that is not exactly a consolation to the hosts**[. We call
this [the]{.mark} phase [transition to extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Figure 4). **[[With increasing]{.mark} levels of [global
transportation]{.mark}, human [civilization may be approaching]{.mark}
such [a critical threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In the paper we wrote in 2006 about the dangers of global transportation
for pathogen evolution and pandemics \[8\], we mentioned the risk from
Ebola. Ebola is a horrendous disease that was present only in isolated
villages in Africa. It was far away from the rest of the world only
because of that isolation. Since Africa was developing, it was only a
matter of time before it reached population centers and airports. While
the model is about evolution, it is really about which pathogens will be
found in a system that is highly connected, and Ebola can spread in a
highly connected world.

The traditional approach to public health uses historical evidence
analyzed statistically to assess the potential impacts of a disease. As
a result, many were surprised by the spread of Ebola through West Africa
in 2014. As the connectivity of the world increases, past experience is
not a good guide to future events.¶ **[A key point about the phase
transition to extinction is its suddenness. Even a system that seems
stable, can be destabilized by a few more long-range connections, and
connectivity is continuing to increase.]{.underline}**

**[So how close are we to the tipping point? We don't know but it would
be good to find out before it happens.¶]{.underline}** While Ebola
ravaged three countries in West Africa, it only resulted in a handful of
cases outside that region. One possible reason is that many of the
airlines that fly to west Africa stopped or reduced flights during the
epidemic \[9\]. In the absence of a clear connection, public health
authorities who downplayed the dangers of the epidemic spreading to the
West might seem to be vindicated.¶ As with the choice of airlines to
stop flying to west Africa, our analysis didn't take into consideration
how people respond to epidemics. It does tell us what the outcome will
be **[unless we respond fast enough and well enough to stop the spread
of future diseases]{.underline}**, which may not be the same as the ones
we saw in the past. **[As the world becomes more connected, the dangers
increase.¶]{.underline}** Are people in western countries safe because
of higher quality health systems? Countries like the U.S. have highly
skewed networks of social interactions with some very highly connected
individuals that can be "superspreaders." The chances of such an
individual becoming infected may be low but events like a mass outbreak
pose a much greater risk if they do happen. **[If a sick food service
worker in an airport infects 100 passengers, or [a contagion
event]{.mark} happens in mass transportation, an outbreak [could]{.mark}
very well [prove unstoppable]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Testing\-\--A2: No Extinction\-\--Burnout

#### Burnout wrong because of [mutations]{.underline} and [transfer]{.underline} -- independent, huge [ABR crisis]{.underline} looming

microbiology (Northwestern), "Tipping Point: The Threat of Antibiotic
Resistance," Helix, 8/17,
<http://helix.northwestern.edu/article/tipping-point-threat-antibiotic-resistance>

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
nearly **[[90,000]{.mark} people [die each year]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in the United States [[from]{.mark}
**[a]{.mark}**]{.underline}nti**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**iotic-**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**esistant
[bacterial infections. That is more deaths than breast and prostate
cancer]{.underline} combined. While [[MRSA]{.underline}]{.mark}
(methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is the most publicized of
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it [[is]{.mark} just **[one of
many]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, other bacteria that kill thousands
of people each year include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. [These]{.underline} bacteria
[are]{.underline} all resistant to at least some antibiotics, giving
them the name "[**[superbugs]{.mark}**", [and]{.mark} the
[number]{.mark} of infections resistant **even to antibiotics of last
resort** [is increasing]{.mark}. How did this happen? We did it to
ourselves. [Antibiotics are]{.mark} omnipresent]{.underline} in the
Western world, [[overprescribed]{.mark} for patients]{.underline} who
demand them [even when they have viral infections. Then these same
[patients fail]{.mark} to take the prescription to [completion]{.mark},
allowing]{.underline} some [bacteria to survive. As a
result,]{.underline} bacterial [[resistance]{.mark} can
**[develop]{.mark} by [mutations]{.mark}**]{.underline} of genes that
antibiotics target**[, [or]{.mark} even from
[transfer]{.mark}]{.underline}** of antibiotic-resistant genes between
bacteria. [This makes bacterial infections **difficult to treat**.
Resistant bacteria multiply and spread]{.underline}, since they are able
to survive the constant antibiotic onslaught. [When a serious bacterial
infection develops, it]{.underline} is likely that the infection is due
to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which [limits treatment options. This
is especially a problem in [hospitals]{.mark}, which [are **breeding
grounds**]{.mark} **for resistant organisms**]{.underline}. Hospitals
have a large number of susceptible people with compromised immune
systems, making a haven for sick people into a dangerous place.
Similarly, antibiotics are overused on cattle, often using them as
prophylaxis, preventative medicine, on animals that are not sick,
instead of only treating infected animals[. All of these situations
select for the bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. **[We've
reached]{.mark} a [tipping point]{.mark}**. For a while we had many
antibiotics in [our arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline} to treat bacterial
infections, [so even if treatment with one]{.underline} antibiotic
[failed, there were other options. **Unfortunately that [is]{.mark}
often [no longer true]{.mark}**[, with resistance]{.mark} emerging
[faster than]{.mark} new [therapies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem is
that drug companies prefer to make medication for chronic conditions,
such as cancer or heart disease, since their long-term treatment is much
more profitable. In fact, according to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), 21 new drugs have been approved for cancer treatment since the
beginning of last year. In the same time frame, just one new bacterial

### Prez Powers\-\--New Mod\-\--Testing\-\--A2: No Extinction\-\--Containment

#### Disease spread guaranteed -- globalization, population density

**Walsh 14** \-\-\-- Bryan, syndicated columnist on environmental
affairs, "MERS Shows That the Next Pandemic Is Only a Plane Flight
Away," Time, 5/5,

On Feb. 21, 2003, a 64-year-old Chinese physician named Dr. Liu Jianlun
traveled to Hong Kong to attend a wedding. He stayed in room 911 on the
ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Liu, who had been treating cases of
a mysterious respiratory disease in the neighboring Chinese province of
Guangdong, was already sick when he arrived in Hong Kong, and the next
day he checked into the city's Kwong Wah hospital. [[Liu]{.mark}
died]{.underline} on Mar. 4 [of]{.underline} the disease doctors soon
named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or [[SARS]{.mark}. But
before]{.underline} he died, he **[[inadvertently
infected]{.underline}]{.mark}** at least [16 people]{.underline} who
spent time on the ninth floor of that Hotel. It's [that chain of
events]{.underline} that [must have been on American officials'
minds]{.underline} last week [when news broke]{.underline} that [the
U.S. had its first case of]{.underline} Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
([[MERS]{.underline}]{.mark}). A male health care provider had been in
Saudi Arabia, the epicenter for the ongoing MERS outbreaks, before
flying to Chicago via London on Apr. 24. After arriving in Chicago, he
took a bus to the Indiana town of Munster, where on Apr. 28 he was
admitted to the hospital and was eventually diagnosed with MERS. [A
deadly respiratory disease that **has already [infected
hundreds]{.mark}**]{.underline}, almost all in Saudi Arabia, [and
killed]{.underline} over [100]{.underline} people had come to the U.S.
CDC officials played down the larger threat of the first U.S. MERS case.
"In this interconnected world we live in, we expected MERS to make its
way to the U.S.," Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on May
2. "We have been preparing for this." CDC officials will contact and
track individuals who might have been close to the patient --- including
health workers who treated him and fellow travelers on his international
flights and his bus ride to Munster --- just in case any developed MERS
symptoms. That's not likely. So far MERS hasn't shown much ability to
spread easily from person to person, so the threat to the larger U.S.
public is probably very small. But if that Indiana case remains isolated
--- and MERS itself never becomes the global health threat that SARS was
--- it only means we were lucky. [As Schuchat put it, [exotic]{.mark},
emerging [diseases are]{.mark} now "**just [a plane's ride
away]{.mark}**."]{.underline} In the past, [before international air
travel]{.underline} became common, emerging [pathogens could begin
infecting]{.underline} people [but remain geographically isolated for
decades]{.underline}. Scientists now think that [[HIV]{.mark} was active
among people in Central Africa for decades before it]{.underline} really
[began [spread]{.mark}ing [globally]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1970s,
[again [thanks]{.mark} largely [to]{.mark} international air
[travel]{.mark}. Today [there's]{.mark} **almost [no spot]{.mark} on the
planet** --- from the rainforests]{.underline} of Cameroon [to the
hinterland]{.underline} of China --- [[so remote]{.mark} that [someone
couldn't make it to]{.mark} a heavily populated city like [New
York]{.mark}]{.underline} or Hong Kong [**[in]{.mark} less than [24
hours]{.mark}**, potentially [carrying]{.mark} **a new infectious
[disease]{.mark}** with them.]{.underline}

**[[Pandemics]{.mark} are disease outbreaks that occur over a wide
geographic area, such as a region, continent, or the entire world, and
infect an unusually high proportion of the population. Two pandemic
diseases are widely cited as having the potential to [pose direct
threats to]{.mark} the [stability]{.mark} and security of
states]{.underline}**: HIV/AIDS and influenza. HIV/AIDS. Since it was
first identified in 1981, HIV is estimated to have killed more than 25
million people worldwide. According to the Joint UN Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), the percentage of the global population with HIV has
stabilized since 2000, but the overall number of people living with HIV
(33 million in 2007) has steadily increased. Sub-Saharan Africa
continues to bear a disproportionate share of the global burden of HIV
with 35 percent of new HIV infections, 75 percent of AIDS deaths, and 67
percent of all people living with HIV. 116 Scholars have identified four
ways that HIV/AIDS can affect security. 117 First, the
disproportionately high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the armed forces of
some nations, particularly in Southern Africa, may compromise the
ability of those states to defend themselves from internal or external
threats. Militaries with high rates of HIV infection may suffer losses
in combat readiness and effectiveness as infected troops are transferred
out of combat roles, units lose cohesion because of high turnover rates,
middle management is \"hollowed out\" by the early death or disability
of officers, and defense budgets are strained because of rising medical
costs and the need to recruit and train replacements for sick soldiers.
The second threat is that HIV/AIDS **[will [undermine]{.mark} the
[international peace-keeping]{.mark} system. Nations with
militaries]{.underline}** with high rates of HIV/AIDS will be **[unable
to provide troops for international peacekeeping missions; nations with
healthy militaries may be unwilling to commit troops to peacekeeping
operations]{.underline}** in nations with a high prevalence rate of
HIV/AIDS; **[and war-torn nations may be unwilling to accept
peacekeepers for fear they will spread the disease in their
country.]{.underline}** The third threat is that a \"second wave\" of
HIV/AIDS could **[[strike]{.mark} large, strategically important
countries such as [China, India, and Russia]{.mark}. These states,
[which possess nuclear weapons and]{.mark} are important players in
critical regions, also [suffer]{.mark} from [internal security
challenges]{.mark} that could be [aggravated by a]{.mark}]{.underline}**
severe AIDS **[[epidemic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its **[attendant
socioeconomic disruptions]{.underline}**. The fourth threat is that the
high prevalence of HIV in less developed countries will cause
**[[political instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[could
degenerate into internal conflict]{.mark} or spread into neighboring
countries]{.underline}**. Unlike most diseases, which affect primarily
the poor, young, and old, HIV/AIDS strikes young adults and members of
the middle and upper classes. By sickening and killing members of
society when they should be their most productive, HIV/AIDS has
inflicted the \"single greatest reversal in human development\" in
modern history. 118

[**[On paper]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[appears to have a robust procedure]{.mark} in place [to assess arms
sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Since 1976, **[the]{.underline}**
**[A]{.underline}**rms **[E]{.underline}**xport
**[C]{.underline}**ontrol **[A]{.underline}**ct **[has
required]{.underline}** that **[the executive]{.underline}** branch
**[conduct a risk assessment for]{.underline}** large
government-to-government **[sales of]{.underline}** major conventional
**[weapons]{.underline}** (commercial sales of many small and light
weapons are covered by different rules). Once a foreign government
decides it would like to buy an American system, it submits a letter of
request. The request kicks off an extensive process that runs through a
variety of offices at the Departments of Defense and State, as well as
other agencies. The Country Team Assessment is the American government's
official risk assessment and is intended to determine:

how the \[weapon\] will be used, how it contributes to the defense and
security goals of the partner nation and of the US, how it will change
the partner country's military capabilities, how the partner country
will protect and safeguard sensitive technology, and the partner
nation's human rights record.

**[Once approved, the matter is turned over to Congress, which serves as
an emergency brake]{.underline}** for this process. **[Absent sufficient
congressional opposition in the form of a veto-proof resolution of
disapproval, the sale is made.]{.underline}**

[**[In reality]{.underline}**, **[the outcome]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[of this process [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** almost
**[[inevitably]{.mark} the same: [approval]{.mark}. Though

things]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** **[just about
anyone]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Although a full explanation of this is
beyond the scope of our work, three possible reasons are worth noting.
First, the benefits of arms sales are obvious and immediate, while the
negative consequences are often less obvious, tend to emerge much later,
and often receive little media coverage. Second, there is no
constituency in Washington opposing arms sales. Presidents see them as a
foreign policy tool, Congress sees them as economically beneficial
benefiting its constituents economically, and the defense industry
provides financial encouragement all around through campaign donations.
Finally, the United States has been the world's leading arms exporter
for so long that the presumption that arms sales work seems to have
become ingrained in the national security bureaucracy.

On May 23, 2019, multiple news outlets reported that the White House was
considering **[an emergency declaration to permit arms shipments to
Saudi Arabia without Congressional approval]{.underline}**. These
reports were met with sharp criticism by multiple legislators. These
recent developments **[shine a spotlight on the contours of the
Congressional notice and approval]{.underline}** mechanisms **[set forth
in the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).]{.underline}**

AECA (22 U.S.C. § 2751 et seq.) is the authorizing statute for the
Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. AECA and the implementing guidance
from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) set forth the
procedures for the development of a transaction under the FMS program,
referred to as an FMS case.

**[Once an FMS case has been negotiated between the U.S.]{.underline}**
Government **[and]{.underline}** the foreign government **[purchaser,
the White House is required submit a formal notification]{.underline}**
to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs, and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (although
this requirement is subject to country- and defense article-specific
dollar value thresholds). **[Congress then has]{.underline}** 30 days
(or 15 days for certain proposed sales to a NATO county, Australia,
Japan, South Korea, Israel, or New Zealand) **[to enact a joint
resolution opposing the sale. Unless a joint resolution is passed within
the time period, Congress is considered to have consented]{.underline}**
to the sale.

**[For major weapons sales, formal notification is often preceded by
informal communications]{.underline}** between the Executive Branch and
Congress. Relevant here, Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on
the Foreign Relations Committee, has exercised an informal hold on sales
of munitions to Saudi Arabia for the past year based on concerns
regarding the loss of civilian life during Saudi Arabia's military
operations in Yemen. These concerns have bi-partisan support, which
signals that a joint resolution opposing any formal notification may be
possible if the White House chooses to force the issue.

**[The [AECA]{.mark} statute [provides]{.mark} the
President]{.underline}** [**[two avenues]{.underline}**
**[for]{.underline}** **[short-circuiting]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the
[Congressional review]{.mark} process]{.underline}**. **[[First,]{.mark}
AECA provides that [the President need not wait]{.mark}]{.underline}**
for the 30-day notice period to expire **[[when "an emergency
exists]{.underline}]{.mark}** which requires that consent to the
proposed transfer become effective immediately in the national security
interests of the United States..." 22 U.S.C. § 2753(d)(2)(A).
**[[Second, the President has the power to veto any]{.mark} joint
[resolution blocking an FMS transaction]{.mark}. Prior to 1986, AECA
provided Congress the right to exercise a Congressional veto over a sale
through a concurrent resolution without presentment to the
President]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** **[the statute was
amended to remove this procedure after the Supreme Court ruled that a
comparable procedure in the immigration context was unconstitutional.
See]{.underline}** INS v. **[Chadha]{.underline}**, 462 U.S. 919 (1983).

**[[Given]{.mark} the]{.underline}** [**[practical
challenges]{.underline}** **[of overcoming a]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[Presidential [veto, the power of Congress to block an arms
sale]{.mark} through a joint resolution [under AECA has historically
been limited]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} and **[according to
a]{.underline}** **[C]{.underline}**ongressional
**[R]{.underline}**esearch **[S]{.underline}**ervice
**[report]{.underline}** issued in April 2019, **[[Congress has never
successfully blocked a proposed arms sales by]{.mark} use of a [joint
resolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, **[[the specter
of]{.mark} Congressional [oversight does influence the]{.mark} FMS
[process]{.mark}]{.underline}** in many situations, including in these
recent proposed sales to Saudi Arabia.

Recent **[media reports]{.underline}** have **[stated]{.underline}**
that **[[the White House may rely on]{.mark} the "[national
security]{.mark} interests of the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates"
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** justify the contemplated arms sales
**[[bypass]{.mark} the 30-day waiting period for Congressional [review,
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[immediately effectuate a sale]{.mark} of
arms]{.underline}** to Saudi Arabia. [**[How the White House and

## \*\*\* SOFT LAW

### 2AC\-\--Possible Frontline

#### [Soft law fails]{.underline} -- no formal consequences for violation

**Weeks 18** -- Greg, Associate Professor of Law at ANU ("Proliferation
and International Crisis Behavior", 2018, Adelaide Law Review Vol. 39,
Issue 2, Available online at
<https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/adelrev39&i=317>, Accessed
on 7/24/19)

Much of what causes **[[soft law]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be
**[problematic is intrinsically linked to its effectiveness as a
regulatory tool]{.underline}**. It **[[does not rely on formal
consequences]{.mark} of breach for its effectiveness [but]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} the general [belief]{.mark} [that]{.mark} soft law
[represents]{.mark} [an officially-sanctioned
norm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A useful hypothetical example is to ask
people to **[[imagine]{.mark} [someone standing in]{.mark} the middle of
a [road directing]{.mark} the [traffic]{.mark} to turn off and enter a
one-way street from the wrong end. [Would you obey]{.mark}?
[Does]{.mark} your [answer change]{.mark} [if]{.mark} we suppose that
the [person]{.mark} [is]{.mark} wearing the uniform of a [police
officer]{.mark}?]{.underline}**7 The fact is that, just like the person
wearing the police uniform, soft law tends to **[come cloaked in the
ostensible authority of the state and owes much of its effectiveness to
that fact]{.underline}**.8 Two worrying points flow from that
conclusion. The first is that **[[people]{.mark} are apt to
[treat]{.mark} certain [instruments]{.mark} [as
\'law]{.mark}]{.underline}**[\',]{.mark} in reliance on the authority
with which those instruments are issued, **[[whether or not]{.mark} they
[have formal consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The second is that,
because **[soft law instruments have no formal consequences, their
[effect is asymmetrical]{.mark}]{.underline}**. An **[[aggrieved]{.mark}
individual who has suffered loss by relying on the continued operation
of soft law [has]{.mark} [far]{.mark} [fewer]{.mark} [remedial
options]{.mark} with which to addres]{.underline}**s its breach,
alteration or withdrawal by its issuing authority. The authority, by
contrast, generally has the benefit of its soft law being obeyed. Soft
law therefore remains remedially \'soft\'. Another way of making this
point is by reference to Australia\'s strict separation of powers
doctrine, particularly as it applies to judicial functions. **[[Soft
law]{.underline}]{.mark}** is at best an imperfect fit to that doctrine.
**[It [represents]{.mark} a [reality]{.mark} that is [not]{.mark}
reflected in [\'legal reality\']{.mark}.]{.underline}**

2.  **[Perm do both]{.underline} --- ensures no circumvention which
    outweighs the small risk of a net-benefit**

#### [Perm do the counterplan]{.underline} --- the aff could be soft law --- prefer arms sales specific evidence

**[[Arms control efforts embrace]{.underline}]{.mark}** a wide variety
of measures. These include \"hard law\" norms contained in treaties,
which are binding international law,2 **[nonbinding instruments commonly
referred to as \"[soft law]{.mark},]{.underline}**\" and measures that
meet no conceivable definition of international law, such as a
**[[unilateral]{.mark} or mutual [restraint from obtaining certain
weapons where there is no agreement]{.mark} to do so]{.underline}**. 3
Trying to understand the role of law in arms control requires one to
take these distinctions into account.

**[Much of the interest in these categories stems from an appreciation
of the growing importance of soft law]{.underline}** in other branches
of international law, **[including international environmental law and
human rights]{.underline}**. As the term is commonly used, **[[soft law
consists of instruments that are not binding but are nevertheless
declaratory]{.mark} of aspirational norms of international
behavior.]{.underline}**

**[One year [into the Trump presidency]{.mark}, [it's clear]{.mark} that
the [norms and boundaries]{.mark} traditionally guiding American
political behavior [have]{.mark} deeply [eroded]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
That matters greatly. A workable democracy can thrive only when there
are basic rules, often unwritten, that curb abuse and guide
policymakers. Though the two of us are from different political parties,
we both believe that **[[now is the time to ensure the president]{.mark}
and all our public officials [adhere to basic rules]{.mark} of the road.
It's time [to turn soft norms into hard law.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[So far,]{.underline}** President **[[Trump has refused to divorce
himself from]{.mark} his [business interests]{.mark}, despite decades of
tradition. He has repeatedly [tried to influence]{.mark} federal
[criminal investigations]{.mark}. [Policymaking]{.mark} processes [have
become haphazard]{.mark}. And [we]{.mark} now [see]{.mark} worrisome
[attacks on the]{.mark} independent [press]{.mark}. All [this
shows]{.mark} just [how easily a chief executive can ignore]{.mark} the
[unwritten rules]{.mark} that typically constrain
presidents.]{.underline}** We see similar erosion elsewhere in
government, too. For example, a major tax bill, affecting the whole
economy, enacted with no committee hearings.

Trump is extreme, but he is not the first president to breach core
constitutional norms. Our system relies on checks and balances,
constitutional commands that are implicit in our founding document but
often not spelled out with specificity. Everyone in the political
process must act as if limited by invisible guardrails to avoid abuse of
power. But at moments of stress or executive impudence, what was assumed
to be a solid restriction on improper conduct turns out to be flimsy,
relying too much on goodwill or unspoken understandings. When that
happens, reform often follows scandal and controversy.

It is an additional point of difficulty that **[[soft]{.mark}
[law]{.mark} comprises instruments which [require]{.mark} the
[imposition of accountability]{.mark},]{.underline}** whereas most
challenges to the **[[s]{.mark}eparation [o]{.mark}f [p]{.mark}owers
[come]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [statutory bodies]{.mark} which are
themselves [designed to bring accountability]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
John McMillan has noted that the '**[[growth]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[non-judicial account]{.mark}ability bodies has [not]{.mark} been
[constrained]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the doctrine of the [s]{.mark}eparation
[o]{.mark}f [p]{.mark}owers]{.underline}**, but equally this new system
of government accountability does not fit easily within that
doctrine.'95 It is every bit as true that **[[soft law]{.mark} [does not
fit]{.mark} [within]{.mark} the [s]{.mark}eparation [o]{.mark}f
[p]{.mark}owers doctrine as that the separation of powers doctrine has
[not constrained soft law's growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However,
where statutory bodies like the Ombudsman have continued to thrive
despite fitting comfortably within none of the constitutional branches
of government,96 the satisfaction that accompanies such achievements is
tempered by the fact that **[soft law is neither organised nor wholly
benign]{.underline}**.

If regulation imposes, by its nature, a certain order, **[[soft
law]{.mark} is more likely to [emerge]{.mark}
[opportunistically]{.mark}]{.underline}**, simply because it operates
effectively **[in the [absence of structure]{.mark} or even official
approbation]{.underline}**. Soft law **[does not require a place within
the separation of powers doctrine for validation or the better to
reflect reality]{.underline}**. It needs neither of these things to be
effective. We, however, **[[need accountability
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like those inherent to the separation
of powers doctrine, to control the use of soft law as a tool of
government. As things stand, the effectiveness of soft law means that
governments can use legislation in such a spartan fashion that the
accountability measures to which it is subject are rendered all but
otiose.97 However, as with anything connected with the Australian
Constitution, formal change is hard to achieve and will happen slowly if
it happens at all.

<http://www.thenation.com/blog/174824/congress-checks-and-balances-afghanistan-will-it-do-so-syria#axzz2euLcvFce>)

**[The]{.underline}** US **[[House]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
Representatives **[[took an important step]{.underline}]{.mark}** last
week **[[toward]{.mark} the [restoration of]{.mark} the [separation of
power]{.mark}s that was established [so that Congress would]{.mark}
check and [balance presidential war-making]{.mark}. [But Congress has
not hit its stride]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[The
House]{.underline}**]{.mark} voted overwhelming for a measure supporting
a full and accelerated end to the war in Afghanistan and **[[expressing
the sense of Congress that any]{.mark} post-2014 US military [force in
Afghanistan requires new]{.mark} and explicit
[authorization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. After twelve years of failing to
check and balance the war-making of successive administrations, the
House voted 305-121 for an amendment to the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which \[requires\] the President
to complete the accelerated transition of combat operations from U.S.
Armed Forces to the Government of Afghanistan no later than by the end
of 2013; the accelerated transition of military and security operations
by the end of 2014, including the redeployment of U.S. troops; and to
pursue robust negotiations to address Afghanistan's and the region's
security and stability. "Today is the first time in twelve years of war
that a majority of the House of Representatives has voted to end the war
in Afghanistan," Stephen Miles of the Win Without War coalition said
after last Thursday's vote. Because the Senate endorsed a similar
measure in 2012---by a 62-33 vote---veteran antiwar activist Tom Hayden
notes that "politically, the development means that the Obama
administration effectively lacks any congressional authorization for a
permanent military occupation of Afghanistan." **[The
amendment]{.underline}**, sponsored by Congressman Jim McGovern, the
Massachusetts Democrat who has long been allied with antiwar groups such
as Progressive Democrats of America, also "**[establishes the sense of
Congress that should the President determine the necessity for post 2014
deployment of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, the Congress should vote to
authorize such a presence and mission by no later than June
2014]{.underline}**." In urging his colleagues to support the amendment,
McGovern (who worked on the measure with Representatives Walter Jones,
R-North Carolina; Barbara Lee, D-California, and John Garamendi,
D-California) explained before the vote: "It is time to end the war in
Afghanistan, bring our troops home and take seriously our duty as a
Congress." That stance, which once would have been considered radical,
drew broad bipartisan support. The amendment secured widespread backing
from Democrats: 185 were in favor of the proposal (including Democratic
leaders such as Nancy Pelosi of California, and Steny Hoyer of Maryland)
while just nine Democrats opposed it. The amendment also won among
Republicans, with 120 in favor to 112 opposed. But the Republican
support came with a caveat: Speaker John Boehner, of Ohio, did not vote.
Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and Majority Whip Kevin
McCarthy, R-California, voted "no," as did many prominent Republicans
who chair House committees, including Oversight and Government Reform's
Darrell Issa, R-California, and Homeland Security's Michael McCaul,
R-Texas. The position of the Republican leaders does not bode well for a
broad shift in the approach of Congress to questions about military
adventures abroad. **[That's especially unfortunate at a time
when]{.underline}** the **[Obama]{.underline}** administration **[is
ramping up US support for Syrian rebels---a move that should be checked
and balanced by Congress.]{.underline}** And its not just a leadership
challenge. When two members of the House---New York Republican Chris
Gibson and California Democrat John Garamendi---submitted a bipartisan
amendment that would have eliminated Sense of Congress language calling
for a US military intervention in Syria, it failed with just 123 "yes"
votes to 301 "no" votes. So where does this leave us? **[It is
significant that the House has laid a marker down with regard to the
Afghanistan occupation]{.underline}**---with an appropriate signal about
the need for the president to seek congressional approval for further
action in the country. Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the California
Democrat who cast the lone vote in opposition to the 2001 resolution
that the Bush and Obama administrations cited as justification for an
open-ended "war of terror" that has sent tens of thousands of US troops
to Afghanistan, was pleased by the show of backbone. Please support our

called for a responsible and immediate end to the war in Afghanistan and
\[last week's\] congressional action is long overdue," said Lee. "With
the passage of this amendment, it's clear that we are turning a corner
on the war in Afghanistan. It's long past time for the longest war in
America's history to come to an end." She's right. **[But [that should
not be the end of it]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[It
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[long [past]{.mark} [time for Congress to
fully and unapologetically reassert its role as the branch]{.mark} of
the federal government [that is supposed to declare wars and to check
and balance the administrations]{.mark} that pursue them]{.underline}**.
That's true with regard to Afghanistan. But **[it is]{.underline}**
equally **[true with regard to conflicts that are now drawing
more]{.underline}** and more US **[attention]{.underline}**, including
the Syria imbroglio. So **[while Congress may be starting to "get

There\'s no doubt. Bush is the worst president in US history. That\'s a
done deal, off the table, at this point. Now, **[we need to talk about

currently doing all they can to impede and stop Bush]{.underline}** and
the incompetents and extremists who misguide him. **[We\'ve reached a
point where we have to draw a line]{.underline}**. DOes your legislator
continue to support Bush? Does your legislator continue to equivocate on
his or her ability to challenge and block Bush from furthering his war?
**[Is your legislator doing all he or she can do to stop Bush from
creating any further laws or policies? Bush must be stopped \"dead in

Bush, who is already brain dead) unable to do any more damage to America
or the planet. Any republican candidate who continues to support Bush,
like McCain, is virtually disqualifying himself form being a viable
candidate. **[[The only acceptable legislation]{.mark} our legislators
should be putting forward is legislation that [is BINDING upon the
president]{.mark}, that stops Bush from escalating the war by bringing
in more troops, [that forbids]{.mark} Bush from [starting]{.mark} any
[new wars]{.mark} with new targets, like Iran or Syria. [Congress should

planning, with the help of the useless Condi Rice, Bush is turning his
destructive, vast powers of incompetence upon domestic issues. We know
from experience, that whatever he touches will turn to the opposite of
gold, making Bush a kind of rectal King Midas. It is not enough and no
longer acceptable to call Bush names, or to label his policy bad.

#### Hard law is key to clarity

**Shaffer 11** -- Gregory Shaffer, Professor of Law, University of
Minnesota Law School, and Mark Pollack, Professor of Political Science
and Jean Monnet Chair, Temple University., Sept 2011, ARTICLE: HARD
VERSUS SOFT LAW IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, 52 B.C. L. Rev 1147

**[To effect specific policy goals, state]{.underline}** and private
**[actors]{.underline}** increasingly **[turn to legal
instruments]{.underline}** that are harder or softer in manners that
best align with such proposals. n79 These variations in precision,
obligation, and third-party delegation can be used strategically to
advance both international and domestic policy goals. Much of the
existing literature examines the relative strengths and weaknesses of
hard and soft law for the states that make it. It is important, for our
purposes, to address these purported advantages in order to assess the
implications of the interaction of hard and soft law on each other.

**[[Hard law]{.underline}]{.mark}** as an institutional form
**[[features a number of advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}**. n80 **[Hard
law]{.underline}** **[[instruments]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example,
**[[allow states to commit themselves]{.mark} more [credibly to
international agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}** by **[increasing the
costs of reneging]{.underline}**. They do so by **[[imposing legal
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** or by **[raising the costs to a
state\'s reputation where the state has acted in violation of its legal
commitments]{.underline}**. n81 In addition, **[hard law]{.underline}**
treaties **[may have the advantage of [creating direct legal
effects]{.mark} in national jurisdictions, again [increasing]{.mark} the
[incentives for compliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. n82
**[They]{.underline}** may **[solve problems]{.underline}** of
incomplete contracting by **[creating mechanisms for the interpretation
and elaboration of legal commitments over time]{.underline}**, n83
including through the use of dispute settlement bodies such as courts.
n84 In different ways, **[[they]{.mark} thus [permit states to]{.mark}
monitor, [clarify, and]{.mark} enforce their commitments. Hard law, as a
result]{.underline}**, **[can [create]{.mark} more [legal
certainty]{.mark}]{.underline}**. States, as well as private actors
working with and through state representatives, \[\*1163\] should use
hard law where \"the benefits of cooperation are great but the potential
for opportunism and its costs are high.\" n85

#### Soft law wrecks the signal

**Shaffer 11** -- Gregory Shaffer, Professor of Law, University of
Minnesota Law School, and Mark Pollack, Professor of Political Science
and Jean Monnet Chair, Temple University., Sept 2011, ARTICLE: HARD
VERSUS SOFT LAW IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, 52 B.C. L. Rev 1147

As we have observed in our previous scholarship, the existing analyses
of hard and soft law tend to begin by assuming that mutual gains from
cooperation among states are achievable. n109 These analyses then
proceed to explore the advantages and disadvantages, the choice, and the
effectiveness of hardand softlaw approaches to achieve these gains. Some
of this literature certainly recognizes that **[soft law can be used in
an antagonistic fashion]{.underline}**. n110 For example, in an early
article on soft law, Christine Chinkin acknowledges that **[[soft law
\"has both a]{.mark} legitimising and [delegitimising direct
effect]{.mark}]{.underline}**. . . . While there is no doctrine of
desuetude in international law, **[the [legitimacy of
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** previously existing
**[[norm]{.underline}]{.mark}** of international law **[[may be
undermined by]{.underline}]{.mark}** emerging principles of **[[soft
law]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" n111 Similarly, Michael Reisman of the New
Haven School early noted **[[the challenge of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
rise of **[[soft law]{.mark} in terms of [generating]{.mark} [an
\"inconsistent normativity]{.mark} [to the point where]{.mark}, in
critical matters]{.underline}**, international **[[law has become like a
camera]{.mark} [whose every shot is a double
exposure]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" n112

Yet the literature has yet to assess systematically the conditions under
which actors are likely to deploy hard and soft law as antagonists
\[\*1167\] instead of complements. What we need, in this respect, is to
build a conditional theory of international law. n113

The perception of mutual gain is certainly an important prerequisite for
international cooperation. Yet **[[the]{.mark} harmonious, complementary
[interaction of hardand soft-law]{.mark} approaches]{.underline}** to
international cooperation **[[relies on a]{.underline}]{.mark}**
hitherto **[[unspecified set of scope conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
By scope conditions, we refer to the conditions under which a particular
event or class of events is likely to occur. n114 In the case of the
interaction of hard and soft law as complements, the primary scope
condition is a low level of distributive conflict among states, and in
particular among powerful states. Second, the proliferation of
international organizations in distinct functional areas of
international law gives rise to legal fragmentation and \"regime
complexes.\" n115 Existing accounts of complementary interaction of hard
and soft law appear to implicitly assume that distributive conflict
among states, and hence the incentive to engage in forum shopping and
strategic inconsistency, are low. n116 These **[conditions may hold in
certain areas]{.underline}**, but variation in distributive conflict and
the **[opportunities offered by regimes and fora with overlapping
jurisdiction should result in actors using hardand soft-law instruments
in different ways]{.underline}**, including sometimes **[as
antagonists]{.underline}**. **[[Under conditions
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** high distributive **[[conflict]{.mark}
and]{.underline}** high regime **[complexity, [we are likely to see hard
and soft law]{.mark}]{.underline}** often **[[interacting as
antagonists]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

By contrast, chapter 2 argues that [[all]{.mark}]{.underline} of these
[[actions]{.underline}]{.mark}, both [[formal **and
informal**]{.underline},]{.mark} [hold the potential to influence
military policy by shaping]{.underline} the [cost-benefit
calculations]{.underline} of both the president and the leader of the
target state. [Vocal congressional]{.underline} support for or
[opposition to the president's military policies may]{.underline}
**[[significantly raise]{.underline}]{.mark}** or lower [the [political
costs]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [president stands to incur]{.mark}
by pursuing his preferred]{.underline} policy [course.]{.underline}
**[[Even if such initiatives hold little promise of]{.mark} ever

much]{.underline} **[p]{.underline}**]{.mark}olitical
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**apital [[the president must spend]{.mark} to

Moreover, through these same actions Congress can also affect the
military costs the president must pay to pursue his chosen course of
action through the signals it sends to foreign actors, who may
incorporate information about unity or discontent in Washington into
their own strategic calculations. Finally, because both the president
and the target state's leader anticipate Congress's reaction to various
options when crafting their policy choices (anticipations that are based
in large part on Congress's partisan composition), the legislature may
exert considerable influence over policy outcomes even when it does not
actively engage in the process at all. Thus, by affecting the
cost-benefit calculations of both the president and the leader of the
target state at both the conflict initiation and conduct phases,
[Congress may exert]{.underline} **[considerable
influence]{.underline}** [through indirect means]{.underline}.

from several nations in Latin America.59 He called up the Army reserves
and made ready to launch Operation Uphold Democracy. **[Clinton did not
seek congressional approval, and Congress did not try to stop
him]{.underline}**. Once again the president turned to the Office of
Legal Counsel for legal justification. OLC argued that Congress had
essentially authorized the action provided the president gave certain
information to the legislature. He had done so, which suggested the
invasion was constitutional. In regard to the War Powers Resolution
(WPR), the OLC concluded that the law sought "to prevent the United
States from being engaged, without express congressional authorization,
in major, prolonged conflicts such as the wars in Vietnam and Korea,
rather than to prohibit the President from using or threatening to use
troops to achieve important diplomatic objectives where the risk of
sustained military conflict was negligible." Since the conflict in Haiti
was not expected to be either long or bloody, the WPR did not apply.
Finally, the OLC argued the Haiti invasion was not "war" in a
constitutional sense: "'war' does not exist where United States troops
are deployed at the invitation of a fully legitimate government in
circumstances in which the nature, scope, and duration of the deployment
are such that the use of force involved does not rise to the level of
'war.'" 60 In sum, **[an armed conflict involving the]{.underline}**
(likely successful) **[invasion of another nation did
not]{.underline}**, according to the OLC, **[constitute a

[resolutions]{.mark} condemning presidential actions [are legally
meaningless and politically cowardly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They amount
to condemnations of the president for taking the initiative of policy
making, without any indication of congressional willingness to accept
the same burden. **[[They]{.mark} ultimately serve only to [further the
perception]{.mark}, in Congress and the public alike, [that the branches
are not]{.mark} legally [coequal]{.mark} in foreign affairs. The power
of the purse should be more coherently and intentionally applied as a
tool of control of foreign military policy.]{.underline}** The use of
lump sum budget items for the military should be limited by statute, and
**[significant uses of force should be required to be funded through
specific congressional appropriations, without which they cannot be
initiated]{.underline}** or continued. **[The use of financial
restrictions to limit military actions entails political risks which
most legislators rightly view as very serious]{.underline}**; as Senator
Jacob Javits noted, **[many in Congress feel that they "can hardly cut
off appropriations when]{.underline}** 500,000 American **[troops are
fighting for their lives,]{.underline}** as in Vietnam."123 But this
perspective is both simplistic and irresponsible because elected
representatives have not only the power to make the case to their own
constituents about why they disagree with the president but also the
duty to assert their constitutional opposition to policies they view as
misguided. They are not serving their own interests, the nation's, or
its soldiers' by standing by while lives are lost in ill-chosen wars.
The courage of American men and women in uniform ought to be matched by
the courage of lawmakers to ensure that they are not placed in harm's
way in vain. For all its difficulties, **[there is evidence that
Congress can stop presidential war making with the power of the purse if
it chooses to]{.underline}**. The Vietnam War ended in 1973 in part
because Congress eventually refused to continue funding it. Three years
later Congress restricted CIA operations in Angola using the same
mechanism. In the mid 1980s, it disallowed funding for the Reagan
administration's backing of insurgents in Nicaragua---a policy that,
while it did not halt support, did force the administration to go to
extraordinary lengths and ultimately to endure a scandal to continue
it.124 Attempts at statutory change should occur at moments when crisis
is absent, and late in a president's term---thus decreasing the
perception that either party is restricting "its" president. In a
crisis, the political costs to legislators of appearing to hamstring the
president are typically too high to bear. These are exactly the moments
when war powers issues become most salient, of course, but this only
means that forethought will be critical if Congress wishes to oblige the
president by statute to seek specific line-item appropriations for uses
of force, for example. **[[Stronger abstract restraints]{.mark}---rules
that will apply to any use of force, like the WPR---will [raise]{.mark}
the [political risks]{.mark} in ignoring Congress, just as the WPR has
done, even for presidents who criticize and ostensibly ignore them. [But
such limits will not likely restrain the president as effectively as a
direct congressional challenge]{.mark} to a particular presidential use
of force]{.underline}**. In such an instance, **[the courts may well be
more sympathetic than they recently have been, since congressional suits
against the president in recent decades have usually been dismissed on
the grounds that the plaintiffs were not speaking for the majority of
Congress]{.underline}**.

[The [U.S. remains the world\'s largest weapons exporter]{.mark}, a
position it has held [since the late 1990s. Our biggest customer? Saudi
Arabia]{.mark}.]{.underline} That business reality came to the forefront
this week in [President Donald Trump\'s refusal to crack down on the
kingdom whose royal rulers have been accused of murdering a Saudi-born,
U.S.-based dissident journalist who disappeared after entering the Saudi
consulate in Istanbul.]{.underline} [The U.S. sold a total of \$55.6
billion of weapons worldwide in the fiscal [Mr. Trump]{.mark} has
[dismissed the idea of suspending weapons sales to Saudi Arabia to
punish]{.mark} its crown prince, [Mohammad bin Salman]{.mark}, for any
involvement [in the alleged murder of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi]{.mark}. \"I don\'t like the concept of stopping an investment
of \$110 billion into the United States,\" Mr. Trump]{.underline} said
this week. Year that ended Sept. 30 --- up 33 percent from the previous
fiscal year, and a near record[. In 2017, the U.S. cleared some \$18
billion in new Saudi arms deals. Last year [in May, President Trump used
his first foreign trip]{.mark} as an occasion to visit the kingdom [and
sign an arms deal advertised as \$110 billion]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a
figure experts have since disputed as inflated, since it was not based
on actual, signed contracts and included at least \$23 billion
previously approved by the Obama administration, according to Defense
One. But even before that announcement, Saudi Arabia was by far the
U.S.\' largest arms client, according to the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute. The current White House has shifted the type
of weapons exports the U.S. favors. Prior to this year, aircraft was the
largest component of U.S. arms sales, according to the Security
Assistance Monitor. Under the first year of the Trump administration,
sales of bombs and missiles dominated. That year, the [U.S. sold Saudi
Arabia \$298 million worth of Paveway laser-guided missiles, \$98
million in ammunition for various types of firearms and \$95 million
worth of programmable bomb systems. [A recent attack]{.mark} on a school
bus [in Yemen]{.mark} that [killed dozens of children was carried out
with a bomb the U.S. sold to Saudi Arabia,]{.mark} CNN has
reported.]{.underline} Just this year, the [State Department has
approved sales to Saudi Arabia of \$670 million worth of BGM-71 TOWs, a
type of anti-tank missile, \$1.3 billion worth of medium self-propelled
Howitzers and at least \$600 million in \"maintenance support
services.\"]{.underline} The Trump administration has taken steps this
year to further boost arms sales abroad. This spring, the National
Security Council put forth a policy that cuts regulations and diminishes
the long wait times usually associated with weapons sales --- all in the
name of economic growth. [The policy, called an \"Arms Transfer
Initiative,\" is explicitly meant to \"expand opportunities for American
industry \[and\] create American jobs,\"]{.underline} Tina Kaidanow, a
longtime State Department diplomat who recently moved to the Pentagon,
said at a conference in August. Some economists question the
effectiveness of the military jobs approach, however, noting that
federal spending on education, health care or infrastructure creates
many more jobs than defense spending does[. Meanwhile, the U.S. remains
the world\'s No. 1 arms seller, with one-third of the globe\'s
international arms exports originating here, according to a report by
SIPRI.]{.underline} Russia, the next-largest exporter, is responsible
for just over one-fifth of the global market. As for where the dollars
from those transactions are flowing, here are the U.S. corporations that
contract with the Department of Defense, along with the money committed
to them last year.

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., expressed hope Wednesday the president's
action would spur House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-N.Y., to pursue a court
challenge of Trump's veto of a measure to end U.S. military aid to Saudi
Arabia in Yemen. (Vox reported Tuesday that Khanna was among lawmakers
and legal scholars who want Pelosi to sue Trump in the Supreme Court
over U.S. involvement in Yemen.) "I'm confident these new arms sales
provides new momentum for pursuing legal action and legislation that
would end U.S. involvement in the war," Khanna tweeted Wednesday. "With

additional troops to the Mideast to counter Iran and [bypassed Congress
on the sales to Riyadh and its allies. The Senate in May failed to
override Trump's veto.]{.underline} On Friday, the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency announced seven sales to the region, in part
including two aircraft follow-on support and services to Saudi Arabia
worth more than \$2 billion, as well as RQ-21A Blackjack drones and
Javelin missiles to the UAE. Further sales are expected to be announced
in the Federal Register this week. The Arms Export Control Act contains
an exemption to sell weapons to partners in case of an emergency,
something designed to speed up the process amid a crisis. In this case,
[Trump appears to be using the tense situation with Iran]{.underline}
--- based on intelligence reports that have been widely questioned by
Democrats, but supported by the Pentagon --- [as a reason to push
through the weapons.]{.underline} Even some Republicans are vexed. "I
understand the administration's frustration that key members of Congress
held these arms sales for an extended period of time, in some cases for
over a year," Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the House Foreign Affairs
Committee's ranking member, said in a statement after the notification.
"However, [the [president's]{.mark} [decision to use]{.mark} an

Congress and sell arms to Saudi Arabia is a misapplication of this

Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act, which bars certain U.S. weapons
sales to Riyadh. (Menendez is one of the co-sponsors of that
legislation.) ["[I don't support the arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline}
now, but I do support American troops going into the Mideast in larger

"Regrettably, Secretary Pompeo's abuse of this emergency authority has

method would be unprecedented in the case of an arms sale conducted to
address a declared national emergency, its likely proponents will be
able to push it to the Senate floor without needing 60 votes. The
parliamentary question is not resolved, though advocates appear to be
confident that the rules of the Senate and the eventual interpretation
of the Arms Export Control Act rules would ultimately favor the ability
to move the resolutions through with simple majorities. If the Foreign
Relations Committee does not act on the resolutions, they go to the
floor automatically after 10 days. A U.S. Department of State official
told CQ Roll Call that "delaying these shipments could cause degraded
systems and a lack of necessary parts and maintenance concerns for our
key partners, during a time of increasing regional volatility." [**The

"While I understand that Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior
of \[Crown Prince\] Mohammed bin Salman cannot be ignored. Now is not
the time to do business as usual with Saudi Arabia," Graham said in a
statement. "I am also very concerned about the precedent these arms
sales would set by having the administration go around legitimate
concerns of the Congress. **[[I]{.mark} expect and [look forward to

Vermont Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, the lead Democrat on both Graham's

co-sponsor. "This [admin]{.mark}istration's [credibility when it comes

disapproval, Republicans and Democrats are standing together in support
of a process of consultation that has worked well for decades,
regardless of which party controls the White House," Leahy said in a
statement. The procedural maneuvering could wreak some havoc on the
Senate schedule, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky
potentially having to dedicate long stretches of floor time to the
disapproval measures if time agreements or a deal with the Trump
administration cannot be reached. If the Senate does pass the bill,
House Democrats appear ready to act on it. Every Democrat on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee issued a joint statement promising new

**Widener, 1** -- Judge for US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
(CARRINGTON GARDENS ASSOCIATES, I, A VIRGINIA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,
Plaintiff-Appellant, v. HENRY G. CISNEROS, SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND
URBAN DEVELOPMENT, Defendant-Appellee, 1 Fed. Appx. 239; 2001 U.S. App.
LEXIS 634, 1/17, lexis)

Under the regulation, 24 C.F.R. § 886.123, the payments to Carrington
could have been stopped for good, the contract terms aside. For
construction of the contract terms, we adopt the wording of the opinion
of the district court for the next three paragraphs of this opinion
which follow:

The plain meaning of the word \"withhold\" is \"to retain in one\'s
possession that which belongs to or is claimed or sought by another. . .
. To refrain from paying that which is due.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary
1602 (6th ed. 1990). Using this common meaning of \"withhold,\" HUD
clearly has the authority to retain housing assistance payments. But,
the HAP Contract\'s withhold remedy also limits how long \[\*\*7\]  the
funds may be retained. The housing assistance payments may be retained
only \"until the default under this Contract has been cured.\" Tr. Ex.
8, § 26. Once the default is cured, HUD may no longer keep the retained
funds. This remedy, therefore, creates a trust type relationship where
HUD has the authority to keep the withheld funds on the owner\'s account
only while the owner is in default and thereafter must pay out the
withheld funds when the default is cured.

In contrast, the reduce-or-suspend remedy suggests a more permanent
forfeiture of funds. **[[The word \"suspend\" means
\"]{.underline}]{.mark}**to interrupt; to cause **[[to cease for a
time;]{.underline}]{.mark}** to post pone; to stay, delay, or hinder; to
discontinue temporarily, **[[but with an expectation]{.mark} or purpose
[of resumption]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" Black\'s Law Dictionary 1446
(6th ed. 1990). \"**[[Reduce\" means \"to diminish]{.mark} in
size]{.underline}**, amount, extent, or number.\" Webster\'s Third New
International Dictionary 1905 (1981). \<3\> **[Based on these
definitions, [\"reduce\" is merely a less radical form of
\"suspend.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Under the common meanings of \"reduce\" and \"suspend,\" HUD has the
authority to discontinue housing assistance payments entirely or
diminish the size of the payments while Carrington Gardens \[\*\*8\]  is
in default. Like the withhold remedy, this remedy limits how long
payments may be discontinued or diminished \-- only \"until the default
under this Contract has been cured.\" Tr. Ex. 8, § 26. After the default
has been cured, therefore, HUD must resume full housing assistance
payments. Unlike the withhold remedy, however, under the plain language
of the reduce-or-suspend remedy, HUD is under no obligation to pay out
any discontinued or diminished funds. The words \"suspend\" or
\"reduce\" furnish no inference or suggestion that HUD is obligated to
retain suspended or reduced funds on the owner\'s account until a
default is cured. This language in the HAP Contract speaks  \[\*243\] 
only to HUD\'s obligation to begin full payments after the default is
cured. JA 546-548.
