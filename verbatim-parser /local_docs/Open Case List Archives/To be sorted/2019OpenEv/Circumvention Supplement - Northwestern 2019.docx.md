Checks on the President's Power to Order a Nuclear Strike." National

[As it is, the president possesses the **exclusive legal authority** to
order a nuclear attack]{.underline}. No general can decide to use our
most deadly weapons, even if the forces under his command face complete
destruction and only a nuclear strike can save his troops. A general
facing a crumbling front and an imminent military disaster has only
conventional weapons at his command. At the same time, the president
doesn't have to consult with Congress before using our nation's ultimate
weapons. It's one reason why the American commander-in-chief is rightly
described as the most powerful man in the world. [**But [it's not
unchecked power]{.mark}**. [Every]{.mark} American [president is
subjected to]{.mark} important constitutional and military
[restraints.]{.mark} The most important constitutional safeguard against
the kind of man who'd launch a truly rogue strike --- initiate genocidal
war on impulse --- is **[the 25th Amendment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
man so unhinged is incapable of serving as president, and the
Constitution provides for his emergency removal if the vice president
and a "majority of the principal officers of the executive departments"
determine that the president is "unable to discharge the powers and
duties of his office." Moreover, a proper reading of the Constitution
also limits the president's authority to initiate any kind of war,
including nuclear war. [The Constitution reserves the power to declare
war to Congress]{.underline}. The commander-in-chief, by contrast, is
responsible for waging war. When our constitutional system is
functioning, [the only time the president should be able to act without
Congress is when he's **responding immediately** to an actual or
imminent attack on the United States, on Americans abroad, or to an
attack on American allies when we're under a Senate-ratified defense
obligation]{.underline}. Even then, he should turn to Congress as soon
as possible to ratify his defensive response and authorize offensive
military action. As we know, however, a number of American presidents
have disagreed with this constitutional formulation and have taken it
upon themselves to wage war without congressional approval. And they've
done so without facing any constitutional consequence. In other words,
one of our constitutional safeguards has already failed --- at least in
the face of lower-stakes conflicts. Thus, we have to consider a
nightmare scenario. [What [if a president snaps]{.mark} --- acting
before his cabinet can remove him --- [and orders a]{.mark}n
indefensible, rogue [nuclear strike]{.mark}? The answer is simple.
**[The military wouldn't comply]{.mark}.**]{.underline} It's officers
are bound by law to refuse lawless commands, and the modern American
military has profound cultural and moral restraints against the kind of
world-changing mass murder that would result from a rogue strike. It
won't happen. In fact, it's doubtful that it would happen even in the
face of more defensible temptations to launch a first strike. Our nation
has suffered conventional military disasters (for example, deep in North
Korea during the first year of the Korean War) without resorting to
nuclear weapons, and [[it's hard to imagine a]{.mark} single [general
recommending]{.mark} [a nuclear strike]{.mark} in the absence of actual
or imminent opposition use of **w**eapons of **m**ass
**d**estruction]{.underline}. Our military is built to fight and win
wars through the use of conventional weapons . . . and conventional
weapons alone. Of course one can always imagine a different, dystopian
future where our current safeguards would be inadequate. But as much as
I've critiqued [Trump on other grounds, I have no fear that he'll
attempt a rogue strike. In fact, [his]{.mark} actual [military
policies]{.mark} since assuming office [have been quite
**moderate**]{.mark}, and [his military operations]{.mark} have not just
been successful, they've been [conducted **squarely in compliance with
the laws of armed conflict**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### He won't try\-\--AND, Mueller thumps.

Donald Trump Distract from His Troubles with Foreign Policy?" Washington
Post -- Blogs; Washington. ProQuest.

No day during President Trump\'s 19 months in office could prove as
dangerous or debilitating as Tuesday. Everything that happened in a pair
of courtrooms hundreds of miles apart strengthened the hand of special
counsel Robert S. **[[Mueller]{.underline}]{.mark}** III and weakened
that of the president of the United States. ... What took place Tuesday
[[will]{.underline} **[ratchet up the pressure]{.underline}**]{.mark} on
the president, will [[embolden his **critics**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
will no doubt inflame and rally his supporters. [If the past months have
seemed increasingly hot, t[he coming months could be **hotter**]{.mark}
**still**]{.underline} --- there\'s little doubt that the Trump
presidency has now entered more treacherous territory, and no one can
know where it will end. ... [Mueller will continue to move
forward]{.underline}, at a pace of his own choosing. Justice Department
guidelines probably will inhibit him from doing anything dramatic in the
early fall, ahead of the midterm elections. Whether more shoes will drop
before Labor Day, only he knows. [One way or another, the president
faces many more months of uncertainty]{.underline}. So how\'s the mood
in the White House? Not good, according to the New York Times\'s Mark
Landler, Michael Shear and Maggie Haberman: Inside the West Wing, aides
to Mr. Trump --- numbed and desensitized by breathless news cycles
blaring headlines about the president\'s behavior --- said privately on
Tuesday afternoon that they were having trouble assessing how
devastating the day\'s legal events might be. Mr. Trump\'s advisers
spent hours working on a statement that was attributed to his lawyer,
Rudolph W. Giuliani, but privately, several said that they could not
come up with something to explain away Mr. Cohen\'s admissions beyond
calling him a liar.... People close to Mr. Trump privately acknowledged
that the declarations from Mr. Cohen, made under oath in open court,
could have significant political ramifications. And as Haberman tweeted:
[Trump folks are]{.underline} **[worried about
impeachment]{.underline}** more than before. [The thinking goes like
this: this is something tangible, **not a theoretical**]{.underline}.
And it didn\'t come from Mueller. [Does not mean it will happen, but
this has moved to a **different stage** in their minds.]{.underline} ---
Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) August 21, 2018 [So [the president is
in]{.mark} a spot of [trouble]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Post has many,
many, many commentators more connected than I to comment on Tuesday\'s
political implications. But I do know a little something about the
politics of foreign policy. [Which leads me to ask: **[Will Trump try
anything]{.mark} in the foreign policy realm [to distract]{.mark} from
his legal woes?** Your]{.underline} **[prior]{.underline}** [on this
question should be [\"**no**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} **[International
relations [scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
pretty [**[dubious]{.underline}** [about \"Wag the
Dog]{.underline}]{.mark}[\" scenarios, and for good reason: [There is
**very little evidence that they**]{.mark} **[happen]{.mark} all that
often.** Could Trump be an **exception**?]{.underline} There\'s some
data to support that claim. For one thing, he clearly thinks that this
is what politicians do. Remember this from 2011? In order to get
elected, \@BarackObamawill start a war with Iran. --- Donald J. Trump
(@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2011 There is also the fact that [this
White House has already been reported to have actions planned to
distract from negative news cycles]{.underline}. My Post colleagues
Karen DeYoung and Josh Dawsey reported last week that Trump\'s White
House had \"drafted documents revoking the security clearances of
current and former officials whom President Trump has demanded be
punished for criticizing him.\" Furthermore, \"[communications
aides]{.underline}, including press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and
Bill Shine, the newly named deputy chief of staff, have
[discussed]{.underline} the [optimum times to **release**]{.underline}
them [as a]{.underline} **[distraction during unfavorable news
cycles]{.underline}**.\" So, if both Trump and his staff think that
foreign policy/national security distractions are a valid political
strategy, will they go that route now? This is where [Trump being an
anomalous type of leader would probably mean more anomalous types of
diversionary foreign policy. Traditionally, the \"Wag the Dog\" scenario
is that a war will crowd out other news stories. [Trump]{.mark},
however, [has demonstrated]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} best [way to suck
up]{.mark} news [coverage]{.mark} ordinarily devoted to scandal is [to
**buck**]{.mark} **the [conventional wisdom]{.mark}**. Schedule [a
**summit**]{.mark} **to meet with Kim Jong Un!** **[Crap all over NATO
and the G-7!]{.mark}** [Going **against the foreign policy
grain**]{.mark} [has been Trump\'s **go-to** ]{.mark}**move**. I would
therefore predict a ratcheting up of the **trade wars**]{.underline}
with our European allies, [more **summitry**]{.underline} with enduring
rival heads of state [and a further pushing of foreign policies that
**polarize at home**]{.underline}. [These are all policies that, with
Trump at the head of government, will accomplish nothing but
**discord**. Given his current state of legal and political peril,
however, it is also Trump\'s **likeliest move**]{.underline}.

### AT: Lashout Impact\-\--Won't Try

#### Stats corroborate this\-\--political gains from war are fake.

One of the most frequently quoted articles in the abundant literature is
the one by Ostrom and Job (1986). Their statistical analysis concludes
that American presidents resort to military intervention more often to
increase their popularity when the level of support is already quite
high than when it is low. This surprising result does not fit the
original hypothesis of diversion strategy. [We]{.underline} would
[expect diversion to be used as a **last resort**]{.underline}, when the
chances of reelection are slim and low enough to justify a risky
strategy. [After all, the rally effect can be **modest**, it is
**temporary in all cases**]{.underline} [and the strategy can **easily
turn against its initiator**]{.underline} [if the conflict drags on or
if **defeat** seems imminent.]{.underline} Ostrom and Job do not
invalidate the hypothesis of resorting to foreign policy as a diversion
strategy. They simply reformulate it. According to them, a government
leader who wishes to engage in military conflict to boost his popularity
needs to have a minimum amount of support to start with. This cushion is
necessary to avoid a disaster in the event of military defeat. The
rallying strategy is primarily aimed at members of the government
leader's party or those in his coalition. Some studies actually identify
a relationship between recourse to military force and conclude that a
tacit norm might exist in several countries, which prohibits the use of
military force on the international stage as a way of conducting
political battles on the national stage (Meernik 1994, 2000, 2001;
Meernick and Waterman 1996; Yoon 1997; Gaubatz 1999; Leeds and Davis
1997; Gowa 1998; Foster and Palmer 2006). These groups of statistical
studies reach diametrically opposed conclusions because they do not use
the same data. Some studies define resorting to force dichotomously,
while others introduce a sliding scale to take into account the degree
of force deployed. Some are limited to the post-- Second World War
period, and others go back as far as the FrancoGerman war in 1870. Some
focus on support for the government leader, while some take into account
the position and preferences of the other actors involved in the
decision-making process. Some studies adopt a unilateral model, while
others consider the fact that variations in levels of support may also
affect the behavior of other governments. Some studies break down the
data on a term basis and consider that the opportunity to mobilize
foreign policy is constant, while others take each crisis as a unit of
analysis that provides government leaders with the chance to intervene.
Some studies ignore the nature of the enemy, while others distinguish
the enemy according to the nature of their political regime.
Methodological controversies always cause disputes, and analysts use
statistical models that are increasingly complex. As yet, it is not
possible to establish a definitive verdict. To be sure, some [government
leaders]{.underline} **[refrain from using military force]{.underline}**
[even though it **could**]{.underline} [be used **to their advantage**.
This may be because they use]{.underline} **[substitutes]{.underline}**
[instead. In particular, they can replace military force with a **trade
dispute**]{.underline}. In [this]{.underline} way, they [can generate a
**similar rallying effect**]{.underline} [and join forces with the
economic stakeholders that stand to gain from the dispute. Thus, when
the **unemployment rate**]{.underline} [rises]{.underline} in the United
States, [the probability that the American president will provoke a
**trade dispute**]{.underline} [increases]{.underline} significantly
(DeRouen 1995; Clark 2001; Whang 2011). [Government leaders can also
substitute a conflict with]{.underline} the **[rhetoric]{.underline}**
of opposition. According to Sophie Meunier (2007), President Jacques
Chirac tinted his speeches with anti-Americanism to create a rally
around the flag that was inexpensive and involved little risk. [Over 40
years ago, **Mueller himself**]{.underline} [insisted that the rally
around the flag is not **solely**]{.underline} [generated by military
conflicts. Curiously, the literature on foreign policy as a diversion
strategy focuses on **war** and rarely **considers** other
possibilities.]{.underline}

#### Rally around the flag only works for real attacks.

A close [examination of existing work on domestic politics and war
provides reason to think that]{.underline} these
**[constraints]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[quite
active]{.underline}**. **[Quantitative studies]{.underline}** [have
found]{.underline} far more **[limited evidence]{.underline}** [for
diversionary war]{.underline} than early work expected. 95 In
particular, [while domestic political factors]{.underline} [often are
**related**]{.underline} [to the use of force, the relationships
typically are **not what the diversionary hypothesis would
predict**]{.underline}. 96 Thus in contrast to the expectation that
presidents facing reelection would be more likely to start a foreign
confl ict to secure their hold on power, [presidents have in fact been
substantially **less likely**]{.underline} [to begin foreign adventures
as elections approach]{.underline}. 97 Indeed, in a more general study,
Chiozza and Goemans fi nd that [conflict initiation is substantially
higher when leaders have a **secure hold**]{.underline} [on
power]{.underline}, precisely the opposite of what one would expect from
the diversionary hypothesis. 98 Similarly, the [tremendous boosts in
popularity that leaders sometimes gain from crises such as the September
11 attacks]{.underline} on the United States [turn out to be **less
manipulable**]{.underline} [than initially]{.underline} might have been
[thought. On average, these gains are]{.underline} quite [**small**,
while the big gains in popularity]{.underline}---the conventional "rally
'round the fl ag" effect---[occur only in cases in which the country was
subject to an **unambiguous external attack**]{.underline} [of the sort
that **leaders simply cannot engineer**]{.underline} whenever it would
be convenient. 99 One could of course argue that the constraints that
appear to limit the ability of leaders to resort to diversionary war are
lifted once war begins; after all, it has long been a truism that the
nation rallies behind the leader once war has begun, and hawks opposed
to settlement repeatedly have used this expectation to accuse moderates
of treason. 100 Yet a closer examination reveals reasons for caution
here, too. To the extent that the public rallies behind the executive,
they often do so because society generally accepts (without substantial
misrepresentation by the leadership) that war is in the national
interest. Thus, for example, while there existed a substantial
isolationist sentiment prior to Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attack
genuinely convinced a broad range of Americans that Japan and Germany
represented serious threats, and therefore that fi ghting a long, diffi
cult war to remove those threats was a worthwhile task. 101 Just as
large rallies in popular support for the president may occur in response
to genuine external threats, we may observe the coincidence of a free
executive and a long war in a case in which the people are willing to
grant the leader freedom to act precisely because the threat is so
obvious that there need be no fear that the executive is extending the
war unnecessarily. [More important, the common argument that society
inevitably rallies behind the government in war is **simply historically
incorrect**]{.underline}. Indeed, [in]{.underline} **[no recent American
war]{.underline}** [has the US government been free from
criticism]{.underline}. Eisenhower won election in 1952 in part by
criticizing the Truman administration's policy in the Korean War, while
Vietnam of course grew tremendously contentious over time. In the 1991
Persian Gulf War, the congressional resolution to use force passed by
only a narrow 52--47 margin, and absent the quick and decisive victory
that coalition forces achieved the Democrats undoubtedly would have
returned to public criticism quite quickly. 102 Republicans repeatedly
insinuated that the 1999 Kosovo War was undertaken to defl ect attention
from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Clinton's subsequent impeachment.
103 More recently, the 2003 Iraq War was consistently divisive, with
John Kerry heavily criticizing Bush administration policy in the 2004
election and a quite public debate over the wisdom of Bush's proposed
"surge" in 2007. When presidents hearken back to the bipartisan accord
of the World War II period, therefore, they are skipping over half a
century in which the occurrence of war hardly guaranteed domestic
agreement. 104 Nor is public opposition restricted to the United States.
[While there almost always are **majorities**]{.underline} [supporting
the leader's policies, especially **early** in wars, minorities in
opposition are frequently **vocal**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
sometimes **[surprisingly effective]{.underline}**. Even the paragon of
totalitarian control over his country---Adolf Hitler---faced an
assassination attempt, which came remarkably close to success, by an
opposition that hoped to negotiate a separate peace with the Western
powers.

### AT: Iran Strikes Impact

#### [No impact]{.underline} to attacking Iran, we'd [decisively win]{.underline}, AND, [good diplomacy solves draw-in]{.underline} and broader conflict

Matthew **Kroenig 12**, PhD in political science from the University of
California at Berkeley, Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Council
on Foreign Relations, "Time to Attack Iran Why a Strike Is the Least Bad
Option",
<http://www.matthewkroenig.com/Kroenig_Time%20to%20Attack%20Iran.pdf>

To begin with, [critics note]{.underline}, [U.S. military action could
easily spark a]{.underline} full-blown [war]{.underline}. Iran might
retaliate against U.S. troops or allies, launching missiles at military
installations or civilian populations in the Gulf or perhaps even
Europe. It could activate its proxies abroad, stirring sectarian
tensions in Iraq, disrupting the Arab Spring, and ordering terrorist
attacks against Israel and the United States. This could draw Israel or
other states into the fighting and compel the United States to escalate
the conflict in response. Powerful allies of Iran, including China and
Russia, may attempt to economically and diplomatically isolate the
United States. In the midst of such spiraling violence, neither side may
see a clear path out of the battle, resulting in a long-lasting,
devastating war, whose impact may critically damage the United States'
standing in the Muslim world. Those wary of a U.S. strike also point out
that Iran could retaliate by attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz,
the narrow access point to the Persian Gulf through which roughly 20
percent of the world's oil supply travels. And even if Iran did not
threaten the strait, speculators, fearing possible supply disruptions,
would bid up the price of oil, possibly triggering a wider economic
crisis at an already fragile moment. **[[None of these outcomes is
predetermined]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [however; indeed, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could]{.mark} **do much to
[mitigate]{.mark} them**]{.underline}. [[Tehran would]{.mark} certainly
feel like it needed to respond to a U.S. attack]{.underline}, in order
to reestablish deterrence and save face domestically. [But it would also
likely seek to calibrate its actions to **[avoid starting a
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that could **lead to the destruction
of**]{.mark} **its military or [the regime]{.mark}
itself**]{.underline}. In all likelihood, the Iranian leadership would
resort to its worst forms of retaliation, such as closing the Strait of
Hormuz or launching missiles at southern Europe, only if it felt that
its very existence was threatened. [[A **targeted U.S.
operation**]{.mark} need not threaten Tehran in such a
fundamental]{.underline} [way]{.underline}. To make sure it doesn't and
to reassure the Iranian regime, [the United States [could]{.mark} first
[make clear]{.mark} that [it is interested]{.mark} only [in destroying
Iran's nuclear program]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in [overthrowing the
government]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [It could then
identify]{.underline} certain forms of [retaliation to which it would
respond with devastating military action]{.underline}, such as
attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz, conducting massive and
sustained attacks on Gulf states [and]{.underline} U.S. troops or ships,
or launching terrorist attacks in the United States itself. Washington
would then need to clearly [[articulate]{.mark} these
"[redlines]{.mark}" to Tehran during and after the attack to ensure that
the message was not lost in battle.]{.underline} And it would need to
accept the fact that it would have to absorb [[Iranian
responses]{.underline}]{.mark} that fell short of these redlines without
escalating the conflict. This [[might include]{.mark}
accepting]{.underline} **[[token missile strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[against U.S. bases and ships in the region]{.underline}---**[several
salvos]{.underline}** over the course of a few days [[that]{.mark}
**soon [taper off]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[or the harassment of
commercial and U.S. naval vessels]{.underline}. To avoid the kind of
casualties that could compel the White House to escalate the struggle,
the United States would need to evacuate nonessential personnel from
U.S. bases within range of Iranian missiles and ensure that its troops
were safely in bunkers before Iran launched its response.
[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} might also need to allow for
stepped-up support to Iran's proxies in Afghanistan and Iraq and missile
and terrorist attacks against Israel. In doing so, it [[could **induce
Iran to follow the path of Iraq and Syria**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
[both of [which **refrained from starting a war after Israel struck
their nuclear reactors**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in 1981 and 2007,
respectively]{.underline}. [**[Even if Tehran did cross Washington's
redlines]{.underline}**, [the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited
[S]{.mark}tates **[could]{.mark} still [manage the
confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the outset of any such
violation, [[it could target]{.mark} the Iranian [weapons]{.mark} that
it finds most threatening [to **prevent Tehran from deploying
them**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [To de-escalate the situation quickly and
prevent a wider regional war]{.underline}, **[the United States could
also [secure the agreement of]{.mark}]{.underline}** its
[**[allies]{.underline}** [to **avoid responding**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[to an Iranian attack]{.underline}. [[This would **keep other
armies**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly the Israel Defense Forces,
**[[out of the fray]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Israel should prove willing
to accept such an arrangement in exchange for a U.S. promise to
eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat. Indeed, it struck a similar
agreement with the United States during the Gulf War, when it refrained
from responding to the launching of Scud missiles by Saddam Hussein

### 2NC -- T/C -- Iran

#### Trump can manifest lies about Iran\-\--"wag the dog" scenario for Iran war

**Kiriakou 18** (John Kiriakou, former CIA counterterrorism officer and
a former senior investigator with the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, 5-4-2018, "The Coming Us War Against Iran", Reader Supported
News,
https://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/49897-rsn-the-coming-us-war-against-iran,
accessed 7-19-2019) wl

[I spent nearly 15 years in the CIA]{.underline}. I like to think that I
learned something there. [I learned how the federal bureaucracy
works]{.underline}. I learned that [cowboys in government -- in the
CIA]{.underline} [and elsewhere around government]{.underline} -- can
[have incredible power over the creation of policy]{.underline}. I
learned that the CIA will push the envelope of legality until somebody
in a position of authority pushes back. [I learned that [the CIA can
wage war without any thought whatsoever]{.mark}]{.underline} [as to how
things will work out in the end. **[There's never an exit
strategy.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[I learned all of that firsthand in the run-up to the invasion of
Iraq.]{.underline} In the spring of 2002, I was in Pakistan working
against al-Qaeda. I returned to CIA headquarters in May of that year and
was told that several months earlier a decision had been made at the
White House to invade Iraq. I was dumbfounded, and when told of the war
plans could only muster, "But we haven't caught bin Laden yet." "The
decision has already been made," my supervisor told me. He continued,
"Next year, in February, we're going to invade Iraq, overthrow Saddam
Hussein, and open the world's largest air force base in southern Iraq."
He went on, "We're going to go to the United Nations and pretend that we
want a Security Council Resolution. But the truth is that the decision
has already been made."

Soon after, Secretary of State Colin Powell began traveling around
Europe and the Middle East to cultivate support for the invasion. Sure
enough, he also went to the United Nations and argued that Iraq had
weapons of mass destruction, necessitating an invasion and overthrow
because that country posed an imminent threat to the United States.

But [the whole case was built on a lie]{.underline}. A decision was made
and then the "[[facts" were created around the decision]{.mark} to
support it. I think the same thing is happening now.]{.underline}

First, Donald [Trump said repeatedly]{.underline} during the 2016
campaign that [he would pull out of]{.underline} the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action ([JCPOA]{.underline}), also [known as the Iran sanctions
deal.]{.underline} The JCPOA allows for international inspectors to
examine all of Iran's nuclear sites to ensure that the country is not
enriching uranium and is not building a weapons program. In exchange,
Western countries have lifted sanctions on Iran, allowing them to buy
spare parts, medicines, and other things that they had been unable to
acquire. Despite the protestations of conservatives in Congress and
elsewhere, the JCPOA works. Indeed, the [inspection regime is exactly
the same one that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations [imposed on Iraq]{.underline} in the last two
decades.

[[Trump has kept up his anti-Iran rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark} since
becoming president. More importantly, [he has appointed Iran hawks to
the two most important positions in foreign policy]{.underline}: former
CIA Director Mike [[Pompeo]{.underline}]{.mark} as Secretary of State
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} former US ambassador to the UN John
[Bolton]{.underline} as National Security Advisor. **[The two [have made
clear]{.mark} that [their preferred policy toward Iran is "regime
change,"]{.mark} a policy that is actually prohibited by international
law.]{.underline}**

Perhaps the most troubling development, however, is [the]{.underline}
apparent [de facto alliance against Iran by **Israel, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.**]{.underline} Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's recent "presentation" on what he called a
clandestine Iranian nuclear weapons program was embarrassingly similar
to Powell's heavily scripted speech before the UN Security Council 15
years earlier telling the world that Iraq had a program. That, too, was
a lie.

Saudi crown prince **[M]{.underline}**uhammad **[b]{.underline}**in
**[S]{.underline}**alman, [the godfather of the Saudi war in
Yemen]{.underline}, [which in turn is a proxy war against Iran, recently
made a grand tour of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and France talking about "the Iranian
threat]{.underline}" at every turn. The rhetoric coming out of the UAE
and Bahrain is at least as hostile as what has been spewed by the
Saudis.

Meanwhile, there's silence on Capitol Hill. Just like there was in 2002.

I can tell you from firsthand experience that I've seen this before.
[[Our government is laying **the** **groundwork**]{.mark}
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} yet **[[another war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Be
on the lookout for several things. First, Trump is going to begin
shouting about the "threat" from Iran. It will become a daily mantra.

His [threats against]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [expose the many dangers of the White House\'s
post-9/11 powers]{.underline}. Here\'s what Congress must do.

President Donald **[Trump's domestic agenda is a
shambles]{.underline}**, [and **his administration is besieged by
scandal**]{.underline}. [He has been badgering]{.underline} Senate
Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell all week for failing to repeal and
replace Obamacare]{.underline}, a futile exercise in browbeating. The
good news is that, as Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer
noted recently, [**[institutions have proven willing to stand up to
Trump]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [ranging from the military]{.underline}
(which won't carry out his ban on transgender people serving) to the
Senate (which defended Attorney General Jeff Sessions from Trump's
attempt to elbow him out of office) to the Boy Scouts (which criticized
the president for politicizing his appearance at their annual jamboree).
"The institutions of both political and civil society are holding up
well," Krauthammer wrote. "[Trump is a systemic stress
test]{.underline}. The results are good, thus far."

But **[[the more ineffectual Trump is in domestic
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[the]{.mark} louder and [scarier he
is on the international stage]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Even [if we accept
Krauthammer's contention that the "guardrails" of political and civil
society are preventing Trump from fundamentally damaging American
society]{.underline}, [**Trump still enjoys enormous unchecked** **power
abroad**]{.underline}. Perhaps precisely [[because he is thwarted at
home]{.underline},]{.mark} [[Trump is]{.underline}]{.mark} now **[[more
prone than ever to lash out against foreign foes]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This week, [[he]{.underline}]{.mark} used the incongruous setting of a
photo op at Trump National Golf Course in New Jersey to
[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [[with nuclear
annihilation]{.underline}]{.mark}. "**[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [best not make any more threats to
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates," he
warned. "[They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never
seen]{.underline}." He doubled down on those remarks on Friday tweeting:

What makes these words terrifying, even if we make every allowance for
[Trump]{.underline}'s bluster, is that he [has the power to make them
true.]{.underline} [America's nuclear chain of command grants a
president absolute authority to launch preventive nuclear
strikes]{.underline} whenever desired. In 1974, as his presidency was
capsizing, Richard Nixon reflected that, "I can go into my office and
pick up the telephone, and in 25 minutes 70 million people will be
dead." Trump enjoys that same power.

#### Circumvention\-\--Trump's imperial presidency enables him to start wars

Much has been made of [Trump's]{.underline} manifest authoritarian
tendencies: that he [sees **politics only in terms of
domination**]{.underline}, [his habit of praising extrajudicial
violence]{.underline}, [and his proclivity for breaking
norms]{.underline}. Yet [[Trump's]{.mark} authoritarian
tendencies]{.underline} [would not get him very far without a mechanism
for enacting his wishes]{.underline}, [and his **nuclear threats make
clear what that mechanism is:** **the Imperial
Presidency**]{.underline}. [The powers of the office]{.underline} are
not just those enumerated in the Constitution, but [the
**[extra-constitutional powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} the presidency
[has]{.underline} [[acquired]{.underline}]{.mark} over the
decades---especially [**[the ability to start wars at
whim]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It's taken someone as frightening as Trump
to make plain that [Congress]{.underline} [must]{.underline} act to
[restrain not just the sitting president, but the office
itself.]{.underline}

Historians and political scientists often use the term "Imperial
Presidency" to refer to the fact that the American president, at least
since the dawn of the Cold War in the 1940s, has war-making powers
closer to that of an absolute monarch than an officeholder in a republic
who is bound by the rules of law. If we are worried about Trump
inflicting great harm on the world, it's [the powers of the Imperial
Presidency that enable him to do the most damage.]{.underline}

[The Imperial Presidency rests on]{.underline} an
[ambiguity]{.underline} in the Constitution. In theory, the president is
coequal to Congress and to be held in check by it. But in times of war,
the requirement of national unity almost always leads Congress to defer
to the president. As Alexander Hamilton noted in "The Federalist 8," "It
is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the
legislative authority." Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth
century, the American political system seesawed: in times of war, the
presidency was dominant; in times of peace, Congress was.

The permanent emergency of the Cold War created an unrelieved wartime
footing in which presidents entered America into large conflicts, like
the Korean War and the Vietnam War, without a formal congressional
declaration. The emergence of nuclear weapons further centralized power
in the hands of the president. Under the nuclear deterrence theory that
America adopted in the 1950s, a president had to be prepared to launch
an attack immediately, which meant no time to consult Congress.

The consequence, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. wrote in his
classic study The Imperial Presidency (1973), was "the all-purpose
invocation of 'national security,' the insistence on executive secrecy,
the withholding of information from Congress, the refusal to spend funds
appropriated by Congress, the attempted intimidation of the press, the
use of the White House as a base for espionage and sabotage directed
against the political opposition---all signified the extension of the
imperial presidency from foreign to domestic affairs." The end result
was "by the early 1970s the American President had become on issues of
war and peace the most absolute monarch (with the possible exception of
Mao Tse-tung of China) among the great powers of the world."

Schlesinger was writing during the Watergate scandal. The Nixon
presidency was both the height of the Imperial Presidency and also the
beginning of its decline, at least for a few years. In the wake of
Nixon's abuses, Congress pushed back. In 1973, over Nixon's veto,
Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which limited a president's
war-making ability, requiring the White House to notify Congress about
the use of force and forbidding deployment beyond 90 days without a
congressional authorization for use of military force. Other measures of
the period include The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act
(1974) which reasserted congressional control of spending.

Writing in The Wilson Quarterly in 2002, Donald R. Wolfensberger, then
director of the Congress Project at the Wilson Center, listed other
examples of Congress rolling back the Imperial Presidency:

The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 was supposed to eliminate the
taint of big money from presidential politics. Subsequent years
witnessed a spate of other statutes designed to right the balance
between the branches. The National Emergencies Act (1976) abolished
scores of existing presidential emergency powers. The Ethics in
Government Act (1978) authorized, among other things, the appointment of
special prosecutors to investigate high-ranking executive branch
officials. The Senate, in 1976, and the House, in 1977, established
intelligence committees in the wake of hearings in 1975 revealing
widespread abuses; and in 1980 the Intelligence Oversight Act increased
Congress's monitoring demands on intelligence agencies and their covert
operations.

As Wolfensberger noted, these [[restraints]{.mark} on the Imperial
Presidency **[were only partial]{.mark}**]{.underline} and often
ineffectual, as [[post-Nixon presidents found **ways to work around
them**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [Reagan]{.underline} administration,
with the pretext of a renewed Cold War, [tried to undermine
congressional limits on aid]{.underline} to the Contras by using funds
from secret arms sales to Iran. President George H. W. Bush tried to
finesse the issue by getting congressional authorization for the Gulf
War, but also saying that it wasn't necessary. President Bill Clinton
bombed Kosovo with support from a Senate resolution that failed in the
House of Representatives.

[Whatever [limits]{.mark} there might have been [on **presidential power
ended with 9/11**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [After]{.underline} President
George W. [Bush delivered a stirring speech in the weeks after the
attack]{.underline}, presidential historian Michael Beschloss cheered on
television that "[the imperial presidency is back. We just saw
it]{.underline}." Under the auspices of the unitary executive theory
promulgated by Vice President Dick Cheney, [the U.S. entered **the era
of warrantless wireless searches, the kidnapping**]{.underline} and
torture [of **terrorist suspects**]{.underline} held indefinitely in
secret prisons, [and]{.underline} [an undefined]{.underline} and
undeclared global **[war on terror]{.underline}**.

[While]{.underline} President Barack [Obama might have tried to bring
some semblance of legality]{.underline} to Bush's expansion of
presidential power, [there was no real curtailment]{.underline} of it.
Instead, with [his use of drones]{.underline} and assassination of Osama
Bin Laden, [Obama's]{.underline} goal [was to act as a more
efficient]{.underline} and focused [Imperial President]{.underline}. As
Alex Emmons noted earlier this year in The Intercept, [[Obama
left]{.mark} behind [a presidency with]{.mark}]{.underline} [**vast,
[unchecked powers]{.mark}** [that could]{.mark} easily [be **abused by
Trump**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "President Obama has spent much of his
time as commander in chief expanding his own military power, while
convincing courts not to limit his detention, surveillance, and
assassination capabilities," Emmons wrote. "[Most of the new
**[constraints on the security state]{.mark}** during the Obama years
[were **self-imposed**, and could easily be
**revoked**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Trump is not]{.underline} just [the heir to the Imperial
Presidency]{.underline}; [he represents a new crisis of]{.underline}
[it]{.underline}. [His blatant incompetence and instability demonstrates
the dangers of investing so much power in the hands of one
person.]{.underline} At the heart of the Imperial Presidency is the
"thermonuclear monarchy" enjoyed by the president, who has the ability
to launch a nuclear war at will. Writing in Politico Magazine on Friday,
Garrett Graff outlined how it works: "[That the president has almost
unlimited and instantaneous authority to push the \[nuclear\]
button]{.underline}. It's undoubtedly the most powerful unilateral
action that a commander in chief can take. Whereas there are careful
multi-branch checks on most presidential powers, over [many decades [the
U.S.]{.mark} carefully [honed its **nuclear launch procedures** to strip
away any **check** ]{.mark}**or balance** that could **delay or stymie a
launch**."]{.underline}

The journal Scientific American has just published an editorial in its
August issue, calling for an end to the the president having sole power
over nuclear weapons:

With the exception of the president, every link in the U.S. nuclear
decision chain has protections against poor judgments, [**deliberate
misuse or accidental deployment**.]{.underline} The "two-person rule,"
in place since World War II, requires that the actual order to launch be
sent to two separate people. Each one has to decode and authenticate the
message before taking action. In addition, anyone with nuclear weapons
duties, in any branch of service, must routinely pass a
Pentagon-mandated evaluation called the Personnel Reliability
Program---a battery of tests that assess several areas, including mental
fitness, financial history, and physical and emotional well-being.

[[There is **no** **comparable restraint on the
president**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [He or she can decide to trigger a
thermonuclear Armageddon without consulting anyone]{.underline} at all
and never has to demonstrate mental fitness. This must change. We need
to ensure at least some deliberation before the chief executive can act.

### 2NC -- M -- Military Lashout

#### [Soft-power restrictions]{.underline} on presidential interpretation justifies [military intervention]{.underline}

**Koh 17** (Harold Hongju Koh, Sterling Professor of International Law
at Yale Law School, 1-17-17, "Triptych's End: A Better Framework To
Evaluate 21st Century International Lawmaking", No Publication,
https://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/triptychs-end, accessed 7-16-2019)

All of this reminds us that---as with the Paris Agreement---[**deals are
sticky, regimes are path-dependent**, and in complex political
equations]{.underline}, **[the locus of domestic legal
authority]{.underline}** often [plays a subsidiary role]{.underline}.
Twenty-first century [**[international legal engagement]{.underline}**
[has]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[expanded]{.mark}
[beyond]{.mark} the traditional tools of [treaties]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and executive agreements [to nonlegal
understandings]{.mark}]{.underline}, layered cooperation, and diplomatic
law talk---[fluid conversations about evolving norms]{.underline} that
[memorialize existing understandings on paper **without creating binding
legal agreements**]{.underline}. These **[soft law tools]{.underline}**
in turn [enhance what international-relations theorists call
**regime-building**]{.underline}.87 Both the [Paris]{.underline} Climate
Change Agreement [and]{.underline} [the JCPOA show how we]{.underline}
now [develop international law]{.underline} and institutions: [less
through formal devices]{.underline}, and [more through repeated
dialogues]{.underline} within epistemic communities of international
lawyers working for diverse governments and nongovernmental
institutions. This regime-building process repeatedly brings together
international lawyers from many countries to talk about these issues
bilaterally, plurilaterally, and multilaterally.88 And as these regimes
develop, they breed a life of their own---building consensus about what
set of norms, rules, principles, and decision-making procedures should
apply in a particular issue area. The
[[stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[seek to define **new soft
norms**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which]{.mark},]{.underline} through an
iterative process, [[gradually]{.mark} [harden]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Intricate patterns of layered public and private cooperation develop,
and formal lawmaking and institutions eventually emerge. [[These
patterns create stiff paths of least resistance]{.mark} from
[which]{.mark} new [political leaders can deviate only at **considerable
cost**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

At bottom[, both deals exemplify high-stakes gambles that repeated
participation in the transnational legal process]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} ultimately [transform national
identity]{.underline}.89 The Paris Agreement bet that developed and
developing nations would all agree to provide progressive, cooperative
national plans that would give each nation incentives to develop clean
energy and enable the world collectively to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. The Iran Deal bet that Iran would become a more open society,
enmeshed with the world, by shifting from a default of confrontation to
cooperation. [To make these grand gambles]{.underline}, like gelatin,
[both arrangements necessarily **started soft and nonlegal**,
**yet**]{.underline} arguably [**became harder and more legal over
time**.]{.underline}

[As this international lawmaking process becomes]{.underline} [more
fluid]{.underline}, our constitutional analysis should not become more
rigid. [Given]{.underline} that [international law and institutions
evolve organically]{.underline}, [we need to develop constitutional
understandings that do not operate mechanically]{.underline}. As we move
from diplomatic dialogue to political commitments to soft regimes to
shared norms to legal rules to international institutions, we should not
impose a formal triptych on novel ways of negotiating international
arrangements, because such rules make such arrangements nearly
impossible to achieve.

Even [in a Trump presidency]{.underline}, [it is a mistake to
conclude]{.underline} that [the goal of constitutional interpretation
should be to raise the costs of presidential action in foreign
affairs,]{.underline} without regard to issue area. After all,
[[if]{.mark} our constitutional [readings **make it harder for the
President to make international deals**]{.mark} than to go to
war]{.underline}, [that [legal rigidity will]{.mark} **inevitably**
[**shift presidential incentives** to rely
upon]{.mark}]{.underline}---and overextend---**[[lethal tools of
American hard power]{.underline}]{.mark}** [instead of deploying our
diplomatic, smart power resources]{.underline}.In the twenty-first
century, we should instead pursue more nuanced conceptual understandings
of the Constitution that promote what Justice Jackson once wisely called
"a workable government."90 As Justice Stephen Breyer has recently
argued, the role of constitutional interpretation must be "maintaining a
workable constitutional system of government": not simply declaring a
set of formal rules, but pragmatically evaluating an existing
architecture of cooperation that allows each branch of government to
"build the necessary productive working relationships with other
institutions . . . ."91

Most fundamentally, these case studies remind us that today, [America's
observance of law]{.underline}---both international and
constitutional---[is preserved not just by the federal political
branches]{.underline} and those officials who lead them at any
particular time, but by an ongoing transnational legal process whose
diverse stakeholders are not controlled by elected officials.92 As the
Paris and Iran examples illustrate, these [stakeholders are
full**-fledged, energetic actors within the transnational legal
process**]{.underline}. [As]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
Administration [unfolds]{.underline}, [these stakeholders
will]{.underline} surely [strive to use all available
tools]{.underline}---[the courts, subnational entities, media, civil
society, transnational alliances and institutions, and bureaucratic
stickiness---to **hold** **America's leaders accountable for their
commitments.**]{.underline}

III\. Multilateral Treaties, Agreements, & Partnerships

[At the end of World War II,]{.underline} [a consensus formed amongst
world leaders]{.underline} about the optimal approach [for preventing
future wars]{.underline}. They believed that the best strategy to
confront anarchy and other threats in international politics, [would be
to form alliances, make treaties, and establish international
institutions]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} tactical change [led to
the emergence of]{.underline} the norm of **[multilateralism in
international relations]{.underline}**. [Multilateralism refers to
"coordinating relations]{.underline} [among three or more
states]{.underline} in accordance with certain principles" (Ruggie,
1992). [The concept of multilateral agreements]{.underline} and
alliances [was not to encroach on an individual nation's
sovereignty]{.underline}, [but to provide the constructs by which to
prevent future world wars]{.underline}. [Within this framework, **the
norm of multilateralism has been successful**]{.underline}. The post
WWII era has witnessed a flourishing of multilateral agreements,
alliances, and partnerships. Examples of multilateral institutions and
agreements range from the United Nations, the World Trade Organization,
the World Health Organization, World Bank, and UNICEF to the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Treaty of Rome. While this is
not to claim that all multilateral efforts have surpassed or even met
their goals, the global network of institutions, agreements, etc., have
proven successful in the fundamental goal of stemming world war.

[[A critical part]{.mark} of the success [of multilateral agreements is
the role]{.mark} that [the **hegemonic** power has in]{.mark} diffusing
and [supporting them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the end of WWII,
[America]{.underline} and its leaders [have embraced this role and
reinforced the norm]{.underline}. As George Sørenson details:

> ...[liberal scholars overwhelmingly tend to agree]{.underline} with
> realists and Marxists as concerns [the relationship between power and
> international institutions]{.underline}; **[it requires a
> hegemon]{.underline}**, a dominant military and economic power, [to
> create and develop an international order,]{.underline} 20 because in
> the absence of such a power, **[liberal rules cannot be enforced
> around the world... without hegemonic power]{.underline}**, conflict
> is the order of the day. (2017)

[The U.S. has immensely benefitted from the role of the hegemonic
power]{.underline}. [[The hegemonic platform enabled
the]{.underline}]{.mark} past thirteen [U.S.]{.underline} presidents
[[to promote American national interests]{.underline}]{.mark} throughout
the world and diffuse its norms, laws, and values globally.

President [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} rhetoric throughout his
campaign and during his first six months in office[, [has sought to
undermine]{.underline}]{.mark} [the norm of
[multilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [He has]{.underline} frequently
**[attacked multilateralism, as he views the world through a
transactional, nationalist lens]{.underline}**. Trump prefers to view
the world economy as a zero-sum game, in which negotiations will result
in a "winner" and "loser". His belief in zero-sum negotiations derives
from his previous experience in the real estate business. Unfortunately,
this outlook does not work in the multiparty international system, in
which the ideals of community and cooperation, to burden-share and
confront the world's problems in partnership, such as climate change,
have become the norm.

The concept of a zero-sum game in regard to climate change is especially
perilous. In negotiations to reduce emissions and protect the
environment, there are no singular winners or losers. [The failure to
protect the environment]{.underline} will result in consequences and
disasters for every country, [regardless of which country made
the]{.underline} most or least amount of concessions during treaty and
agreement negotiations. [Trump's insistence on conducting
negotiations]{.underline} and reviewing previous agreements and treaties
for areas in which to "win," [suffers from a profound lack of
understanding]{.underline} of the benefits of
[multilateralism]{.underline} and will prove highly unproductive, if not
disastrous.

[It is critical to challenge]{.underline} [[the conservative
theory]{.underline}]{.mark} that [multilateralism negatively impacts
sovereignty]{.underline} [and threatens democracy]{.underline}. This is
important in the Trump Administration as many of 21 his advisors
subscribe to conservative and other right-wing values. [This
belief]{.underline} among conservatives [derives from the notion that
multilateral treaties impede domestic law and American
democracy]{.underline} by permitting foreigners to create binding laws
(Kaye, 2013). [The perceived adverse impact on American democracy
**[fails to recognize the hegemonic power that America enjoys and its
ability to frame treaties]{.mark}**]{.underline} and agreements towards
its interests. Furthermore, as Robert Keohane, Stephen Macedo, and
Andrew Moravscik discuss, multilateralism enables a pooling of democracy
which permits:

> ...Democratic polities to achieve policy goals together that none
> could realize alone. Without reciprocal cooperation, governments
> cannot reach domestic goals such as slowing global warming,
> liberalizing the international economy, integrating communication
> systems, combating terrorism, and regulating multinational
> corporations (2009).

With regard to multilateralism, Trump has hurled his harshest attacks at
the United Nations and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Trump has
compared the U.N. to a political game and called it an underperformer
(Parker, 2016) & (Nelson, 2017). Beyond his verbal attacks, Trump has
proposed slashing American contributions to the U.N., with specific cuts
designated for peacekeeping missions. These cuts would severely limit
the U.N.'s and its agencies' abilities to fulfill their missions.
Trump's recommendations came in the form of his budget proposal to
Congress. In subsequent explanations, Trump stated that he believed the
amount of funding that the U.S. contributes to the U.N. is "unfair", as
U.S. contributions compose twenty-two percent of the U.N.'s core budget
(Nichols, 2017). Despite the high percentage of overall funding, the
number is based upon agreements in the U.N. General Assembly and are
reflective of the U.S. economy. The U.N. is perhaps one of the most
effective 22 venues that the U.S. has had in diffusing its norms and
values. The notion of reducing staggering amounts of funding would
severely limit the U.N.'s functional capacity and have the potential to
wreak internal havoc, as budgetary measures would likely have to be
renegotiated and the viability of the organization would be questioned.
In the end, an organization that has served for decades as a proponent
of numerous U.S. values and interests would be severely crippled, which
could result in a highly unstable international order.

The TPP was a multilateral free trade agreement negotiated by the Obama
Administration. Its principle aim was to "reduce trade and investment
barriers among 12 Pacific Rim countries, including the United States"
(Ikenson, 2016). By pushing for the TPP, the U.S. sought to reassert its
presence in the Pacific. Indeed, the TPP would have overwhelmingly
aligned with American norms and practices, especially with regard to
trade. This was evidenced by some of the protections and restrictions
that the TPP included, such as, intellectual property protections for
American technologies, labor protections, protections for endangered
wildlife, support for trade unions, and the elimination of harmful child
labor practices (USTR.gov, 2016).

In addition, TPP would have provided a counter-balance to the rise of
China's influence in political and economic arenas, especially within
China's regional sphere. China's rise threatens the international
liberal order as the PRC often does not follow established norms and
practices. The TPP had enormous potential, as it would have forced China
to loosen the protectionist measures it has on its markets and lead to
further opening (Naughton, Kroeber, De Jonquieres, & Webster, 2015)
Furthermore, the twelve-nation bloc would have had greater negotiating
power in trade negotiations with China and the potential to force China
to conform with additional trade norms. 23

The decision of Trump to walk away from the TPP is exceptionally
ill-conceived. As Trump spoke of TPP throughout his campaign, he was
unable to identify if China was even part of the TPP (Friedman, 2017).
Trump's misinformed belief that he can negotiate a "better" trade deal
with China bilaterally, than in aligning the U.S. under TPP, will likely
lead to a lessened position of the U.S. vis-à-vis Asia, generally and
with China specifically. The bargaining power of a single actor will
rarely outweigh a twelve-bloc alliance, such as TPP. Trump's misbegotten
calculus on TPP could prove a tragic retrenchment stemming from his
woeful lack of understanding of the international liberal order, its
norms, or value the necessity for the hegemonic power.

The norm of multilateralism has always held a critical role in the
international liberal order. The threat that President Trump poses to
that norm, could result in severe degradations of international
institutions and organizations and established multilateral treaties,
agreements, and partnerships. Trump's beliefs about the impacts of
multilateralism on America are demonstrably facile and unfounded.
America, especially as the hegemonic power that guarantees most
international institutions and partnerships, often experiences the most
gains from multilateralism.

Furthermore, [[Trump's departure from viewing the global order
through]{.mark} lenses of [cooperation]{.mark} and
community]{.underline} to ones of transactional and nationalist stances,
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the end, likely [[harm
America]{.underline}]{.mark} and Americans most. [[The global loss of
the hegemonic guarantor]{.underline} [will result in a
creation]{.underline} ]{.mark}[of space for [a new hegemonic power to
rise]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[potentially an American
adversary]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Finally[, a rejection of
multilateralism]{.underline} [will]{.underline} likely [result in lost
opportunities and intentional avoidances of America]{.underline}.
[Allies and adversaries]{.underline} alike, [will strive to create new
multilateral agreements]{.underline} and alliances. [They will seek
