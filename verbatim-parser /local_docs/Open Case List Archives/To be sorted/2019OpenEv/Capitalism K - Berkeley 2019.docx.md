#### The logic of arms sales is rooted in neoliberalism and cold war policy -- only capitalism can explain US militarism and arms sales

[In January 1994, the North Atlantic Council agreed to expand NATO to
include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic,]{.underline} whilst
other candidates were invited to join a Partnership for Peace. [This was
a unilateral choice made by the US without consulting its
partners]{.underline}. As Thomas Schreiber writes, the selection was due
to 'powerful Polish and Hungarian lobbies in the US and Albright's Czech
origins, but the countries also represented attractive markets for US
arms sales, given the imminent replacement of obsolete Soviet equipment'
(Schreiber 2004). **[The need for arms sales arose from the fact that
after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the victorious conclusion of
the First Gulf War, the companies identified by Nitzan and Bichler as
prime defence contractors in anticipation of an adverse procurement
conjuncture had embarked on a process of reorganisation]{.underline}**.
**[The US aerospace industry in particular was extremely receptive to
the assumption of 'new responsibilities']{.underline}** by Washington.
As I have shown elsewhere (2006: 261-2, 273-4), it was going through a
series of mega-mergers (Lockheed and Martin, Boeing-Rockwell-McDonnell
Douglas, Raytheon and Hughes) which brought it in close touch with Wall
Street bankers assisting in the process. Clinton already in June 1991
had been invited for what the New York Times later called 'a job
interview' on Wall Street (International Herald Tribune, 16 February
1999). The appointment of Robert Rubin (then from Goldman Sachs) and
Richard Holbrooke (Lehman Bros, Credit Suisse First Boston) to his
cabinet, along with the continuation of Alan Greenspan at the Federal
Reserve (J.P. Morgan), gave Wall Street the whip hand in the Clinton
Administration. Not only did the Clinton administration in 1999 suspend
the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that separated (international and
risk-seeking) investment banking from (national and risk-avoiding)
deposit banking. [Its neoliberal activism also duly included opening up
financial markets across the globe. Certainly the 1999 G 7 meeting in
Cologne agreed that the financial system required strengthening in light
of the Asian crisis and the collapse of the LCTM hedge
fund]{.underline}. But countries the world over were also expected to
pursue, as cited by Christopher Rude, 'capital account liberalization...
in a careful and wellsequenced manner, accompanied by a sound and
well-regulated financial sector and by a consistent macroeconomic policy
framework' (Rude 2008: 214). Thus they would be able to stick to tight
monetary and fiscal policies keeping wage and social security costs at a
minimum. **[The alliance of Wall Street finance and US/NATO militarism
was cemented when Holbrooke supervised NATO intervention in Yugoslavia
between 1994 and '99]{.underline}**. Unlike the First Gulf War, the
collapse of the USSR in the meantime had removed the need to consult
with Russia. However, the weight of the two components varied over time.
As De Graaff and Van Apeldoorn write, [foreign policy under Clinton was
'oriented towards the promotion of globalization as a programme of
global marketization and commodification']{.underline} (de Graaff and
Van Apeldoorn 2011: 408, emphasis deleted); under Bush Jr., it was
exchanged for a policy focusing on 'external dangers, imagined or real'
(Ibid.: 410). Compared to Clinton's two terms, the links of the Bush Jr
administration with Wall Street were not as prominent as its
predecessor's; those with oil companies were more pronounced even if the
largest and closest, Enron, collapsed under the weight of creative
bookkeeping soon after Bush took office. With key figures in the
administration such as vice-president Cheney and national security
adviser Condoleezza Rice having spent the Democratic interval on the
boards of oil (equipment) companies, the switch from neoliberal
globalisation to a renewed focus on the Middle East becomes plausible.
[The militarist line was again articulated is by the Neo-Con 'Project
for a New American Century' launched in 1997]{.underline}. It
reactivated the network that originated in the Jackson/Nitze group and
transformed itself into the Committee on the Present Danger (the single
most important network represented in the Reagan administration,
Brownstein and Easton 1983: 500, 533-4). The Defence Planning Guidance
1994- 1999 cited earlier was a product of the same set of people. [The
relatively close links of the Bush Jr. administration with defence
companies observed by De Graaff and Van Apeldoorn need not surprise, but
then, the authors emphasise the continued representation of finance also
under Democratic governments]{.underline} (de Graaff and Van Apeldoorn
2011: 420). This underscores that we are looking at an integral grand
strategy in which the entire spectrum of US and allied transnational
capital has its part to play. [The key difference, then, between the
post-war corporate liberal concept of control that assumed legitimate
'corporate' representation]{.underline} (i.e. in international
relations, bloc formation) [and neoliberalism, is global governance by
the West]{.underline}. Against it no valid opposition can be upheld. The
Defence Planning Guidance 1994-1999 already warns against a
're-nationalization of security policy' (of other states, DPG 1992: 2)
and urges the US to focus on 'precluding the emergence of any potential
future global competitor' and never allow a situation of mutually
assured destruction to arise again[. 'It is not in our interest or those
of the other democracies to return to earlier periods in which multiple
military powers balanced one another off in what passed for security
structures']{.underline} (DPG 1992: 5, 15, 46). [Within this broad
concept, the Bush Jr. merely emphasised the military/Middle East axis,
but this coincided with a drastic decline of its civilian economic
involvement.]{.underline} Claude Serfati interprets the Bush Jr turn
towards military solutions---nominally in response to 9/11, but in fact
going back to the mid-80s plans for a War on Terror---as a continuation
of globalisation by other means. '"**[New wars",' he writes, 'should be
considered not only a consequence, but also an active component of
economic and financial globalisation]{.underline}**, as they are
integrated into global financial and trade systems' (Serfati 2004: 195).
Throughout the neoliberal epoch (so from the 1980s on) **[the US has
relied on military outlays, exports, and actual intervention; from 2001
its nonmilitary involvement was reduced drastically]{.underline}**.
Exports from the US have declined by roughly 20 percent over the last
decade, beginning in 2001 (del Gatto et al., 2011: 12). US arms exports
on the other hand rose steadily and in 2011 totalled \$66.3 billion,
more than three-quarters of the global arms market. Russia was a distant
second, with \$4.8 billion in deals. **[The American weapons sales total
was the largest single-year sales total in the history of United States
arms exports, according to the New York Times]{.underline}** (26 August
2012). [The wars of the neoliberal epoch are about dispossessing state
classes that keep countries of various sizes closed to Western political
influence and transnational capital]{.underline}. Serfati refers to a
September 2002 report supposedly authored by Condoleezza Rice which
argues that [the struggle against the Axis of Evil (rogue) states is
about free markets and free trade which according to this report 'arose
as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of
economics']{.underline} (cited in Serfati 2004: 198). Indeed as the
author concludes, Some European countries are frustrated with the Bush
administration's use of military might as a tool for gaining a
competitive economic edge over its military allies (i.e. by
marginalising French interests in Iraq). What if the "prime enforcer of
global-economic liberalism" abandons the rules adopted within the
multilateral global governance framework for a set of rules of its own?
(Serfati 2004: 200, citing Robert Cox). The advantage that the United
States enjoys by adding its overwhelming military might to its overall
competitive profile (including, notably, the IT sector in which US
capital holds the cards, Microsoft, Google/Facebook, etc. which
increasingly is being integrated into state surveillance and
intelligence structures) has been consolidated under Obama. Military and
financial assets, the neoliberal package that restored US competitive
advantage from the Reagan presidency on and was thrown into high gear by
Clinton, then ran into trouble as one component, footloose international
finance, imploded in the crisis of 2007-8.

#### Capitalism causes extinction through ecosystem, techno, and financial system collapse---propertisation bias precludes possibility of reform

Ecosystems processes Early on in Silent Spring, Rachel Carson asks what
has silenced the voices of spring. The first large-scale study of this
and many other environmental questions is not her book, but the 1972
report by Meadows et al. entitled The Limits to Growth (LG). This study
of the world's future relied on what is, by today's standards, ancient
computing technology. Around that time, Intel's first processor was
capable of processing about 60,000 instructions per minute. Today's
processors operate in hundreds of millions of instructions per minute.
Despite its age, the [LG's analysis of the trajectory of world
population, industrialisation, pollution, food production and resource
depletion has proved to be much more robust]{.underline} than one might
have anticipated, especially since its formal world model plots these
trajectories to 2100. In 2008, Graham Turner published a paper in which
he compared three key LG scenarios with independently obtained
historical data from 1970 to 2000. Of the three scenarios, the scenario
described by LG as the standard run (where the world system follows a
business-as-usual path) lined up well with the actual historical data.
In the standard-run model, [food production, industrial output and
population grow exponentially, consuming nonrenewable resources to the
point where resource extraction consumes too much investment and the
industrialised food system collapses, **bringing about eventual
population decline**]{.underline}. Since LG, we have much more
understanding and evidence concerning processes of ecological change.
The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is well
known. Equally important, but less well known, is an initiative known as
the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment that was launched in 2001.2
Involving more than 1,360 scientists from 95 countries, it produced a
series of technical studies and reports on changes in ecosystems and the
likely consequences for human wellbeing. [Economic growth has impacted
on these ecosystems to the point where some **15 out of 24 major systems
are in global decline**]{.underline} (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
2005: 1). Obviously, ecosystems processes can be described in scientific
terms in many different ways, but, for our purposes, we will say that
these are [nonlinear processes containing feedback loops and exponential
growth patterns.]{.underline} Exponential functions played a critical
role in the systems modelling done in LG. [Techno-processes collapse
**Large-scale extinction of humans through a technological process may
be an accident or intentional.**]{.underline} The world became much more
conscious of intentional extinction after 'Little Boy' and 'Fat Man'
exploded over Japan in 1945. Some of the scientists who had built these
atomic bombs formed an organisation called the Atomic Scientists of
Chicago. Through a publication called the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists of Chicago, they began to inform the public of the dangers of
nuclear energy. In 1947, the bulletin showed on its front cover a clock
set at seven minutes to midnight, with midnight being the moment of
apocalypse.3 Since 1947, the bulletin has warned of two other riders of
the apocalypse: [**carbon technologies leading to climate change and
biological developments that threaten biosecurity**. Technological
developments continue to open up new scenarios.]{.underline} The cheap
printing of millions of [war robots would enable aggressors to launch
wave after wave of attack against carefully chosen key economic
centres]{.underline}---something both difficult and costly to defend
against. How might one characterise the processes of techno-collapse?
One obvious feature of these processes is to say that they are examples
of innovation. Clearly, this raises the rather large issue of how best
to characterise innovation. Over the past few decades there has been
within economics a shift towards analysing innovation using various
kinds of evolutionary models (Foster and Metcalfe 2001). The
evolutionary economics literature on innovation is large. For present
purposes, we draw on the idea advanced by Richard Nelson (2001) that
technology and institutions are characterised by a coevolutionary
relationship. 3 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists of Chicago is

of destruction Technologies]{.underline} do not arrive courtesy of
Promethean delivery, but rather are endogenous, [their future path
dependent on institutional responses to them. Financial processes
collapse]{.underline} The GFC of 2007--08 [was a reminder that
capitalism's markets of financial intermediation bust]{.underline} as
well as boom. How do we characterise the processes that lead to
financial crises? Marx believed that crisis was a structural property of
capitalism, linked to the tendency of profit to fall and ultimately to a
contradiction between the forces of labour and capital. One can label
this a dialectical process, but, ultimately, there is not much
specificity in the idea, especially when compared with the models of
financial behaviour being developed within economics. Much more
sophisticated models have emerged within economics to explain the
instability of capitalism's financial systems. An early example of this
is Minsky's financial instability hypothesis, which is based on the idea
that instability is linked to expectations generated during euphoric
phases of the economy (for a formal model, see Keen 1995). For present
purposes, the processes behind capitalism's fluctuations or
instabilities can be roughly characterised as belonging to the family of
nonlinear dynamics in which system chaos plays a prominent role. Summing
up[, **the governance systems of regulatory capitalism face three
distinct existential challenges: ecosystems collapse, techno-collapse
and financial systems collapse**.]{.underline} These challenges are best
thought of as ongoing processes of change to which regulatory capitalism
is currently responding and to which it will have to continue to respond
adaptively if it is to survive in the long term[. In the case of
ecosystems, capitalism has to confront nonlinear dynamics containing
exponential functions; in the case of techno-collapse, there are
processes of coevolution in which institutions play a crucial role; and,
in the case of financial collapse, we have nonlinear dynamics
characterised by chaotic behaviour.]{.underline} Section 2 suggested
that regulatory capitalism, through its many networks of regulatory
intervention and governance, has increased rather than decreased its
adaptive capacities. Section 5 discusses in more detail the question of
how these improved adaptive capacities fare in the face of the processes
of change described in this section. Before moving to this, the next
section identifies a **[core feature of capitalism that will shape its
systemic responsiveness to these processes:
commodification]{.underline}** Regulatory Theory: Foundations and
Applications 770 4. The tragedy of [commodification **Ever higher levels
of commodity production and exchange are a fundamental characteristic of
capitalism**]{.underline}. Marx, in explaining capitalism as a
distinctive system of commodity production, borrows a distinction from
Adam Smith between use value and exchange value (Fine 1984: 20--3). Some
things, such as ecosystems, have a use value without necessarily having
an exchange value[. Capitalism, as a system of commodity production,
relies on property rights in the process of converting things that have
use values into commodities]{.underline}---that is, things with exchange
values. It is through new property rights that capitalism expands the
horizons of its commodification possibilities (Drahos 1996). For
example, mathematical algorithms have use values (think of the algorithm
of addition that underpins your checking of the restaurant bill), but
they do not have an exchange value until property rights are defined in
ways that allow for their appropriation (for example, by allowing the
patentability of algorithms). Piketty (2014), in his recent treatment of
capitalism, draws from Marx the 'principle of infinite
accumulation'---the idea that capital necessarily accumulates and
concentrates in fewer hands. For our purposes, it is important to
emphasise that [continued capital accumulation is only possible **if
capitalism keeps on generating new commodification
possibilities**]{.underline}. The generation of these possibilities
depends most deeply on the institution of property. New forms of
property rights such as intellectual property rights create new asset
classes and these assets become part of financial capitalism,
underpinning, for example, the price values of new financial instruments
such as different types of derivatives. [Property along with contracts
constitute processes of **propertisation that are fundamental to
capitalism's method of change and expansion**]{.underline}. While one
can identify many different types of capitalism, the one thing that
unites them is the expansion of their commodity horizons through
propertisation. One can think of [the propertisation process of
capitalism **as a bias or weight**]{.underline} in the system, meaning
[it will tend to land on a commodity rather than commons
solution]{.underline} more often than not. This bias manifests itself in
various ways, including in the influential idea associated with Hardin
(1968) that the [commons leads to a 'tragedy' of destructive
overuse]{.underline}---a tragedy that the propertisation of the commons
can prevent. The problems of this propertisation bias are too great to
explore here, but, among other things, it ignores the role of the
intellectual commons in serving multiple generations of creators
Solutions based on the blind application of property rights risk another
kind of tragedy: the tragedy of commodification

#### The alternative is to engage in anticapitalism, an act of radical resistance grounded in grassroots movements. Anticapitalism does not represent an unattainable utopia but challenges common myths about capitalism as a whole.

*A note on terminology* The book will draw on four core concepts. The
first of these is capitalism. The term capitalism is used throughout the
book to refer to the prevailing form of social organization. While
acknowledging that the ways in which capitalism operates and the
implications of these operations are contested, this book defines
capital­ ism in terms of one commonly accepted distinguishing feature:
that capitalism is a system that organizes the production, distribution
and exchange of goods, on the basis of private property, with a view to
realizing profit and therefore increasing wealth. The second term is
alternative capitalism, which is used to describe a system where the
capitalistic relationship between state and market is re-regulated, but
not fundamentally reformed, in order to try to produce optimal social
and economic outcomes. The aim of an alternative capitalism is to
maximize wealth and profit by introducing a different structure of rules
to govern capitalism. The third concept is that of an alternative to
capitalism. [[An alternative to capitalism]{.mark} is distinct from
capitalism because it [places an emphasis on social and civic
goals]{.mark}, rather than purely focusing on pecuniary gain. In
contrast to capitalism, an alternative to capitalism is founded on
collective or community property rights, rather than individual property
rights, although the form and extent of collective or community property
rights may vary.]{.underline} Where the book is referring to either an
alternative capitalism or an alternative to capitalism, it uses the form
'alternative (to) capitalism'. [The final concept the book uses is
anti-capitalism. It uses the term [anti-capitalism]{.mark} to [refer to
the act of resisting capitalism, whether this occurs by attempting to
influence the state, taking control of the state, or actions taken
independently or outside of the state.]{.mark} An individual who pursues
or wishes to pursue an alternative to capitalism can therefore be
described as an anti-capitalist.]{.underline}

Traditions of Resistance\
In its consideration of capitalism and its alternatives, this book
accepts that it is possible to perceive capitalism and its con­ sequences
in different ways. Furthermore, it acknowledges that the way in which
capitalism and its consequences are perceived will have a fundamental
impact on whether people deem capitalism to be desirable, whether they
would prefer an alternative capitalism or an alternative to capitalism,
and therefore whether they believe that it is important and worthwhile
engaging in resistance to capitalism through the social act of
anti-capitalism. However, [the central argument]{.underline} of this
book [is that **[capitalism displays intrinsic tendencies towards crisis
that make an alternative to capitalism desirable, and]{.mark} so
[justifies anti-capitalist action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In doing so,
it argues that [[capitalism is a product of social interaction between
people, and]{.mark} that it [is remade or resisted through our social
action. This ­emphasis on social constitution challenges common
assertions about the inevitability of capitalist logic,]{.mark} and in
the process shows that the prospect of realizing an alternative to
capitalism is more than wishful thinking]{.underline}. In its
discussions of alternatives to capitalism, however, [this book guards
against thinking of alternative forms of social organization as outcomes
or utopias. Rather, it shows how various forms of alternative social and
economic organization have shown a tendency to degenerate over time, or
to reproduce injustices of capitalist social relations. It therefore
suggests that **[alternatives to capitalism should be thought of as
processes that need to be continually]{.mark} made and [remade]{.mark}
if they are [not to degenerate or reproduce the injustices of capitalist
social relations, and if desirable outcomes are to be
realized]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Reflecting the book's emphasis on the
social constitution of economy and society, [it rejects 'top-down'
attempts to impose an alternative to capitalism by political means, and
argues that anticapitalist action should take a 'bottom-up'
form]{.mark}, which requires democratic and pluralistic experimentation
with different models of social and economic organization to expand the
space in which non-capitalist activity takes place.]{.underline}

[The arguments of the book therefore fit with a long tradition of
anti-capitalist resistance]{.underline}. One of the most well-known
instances of this kind of resistance was the insurrections of 1968,
typified by the student revolts in Paris in May of that year. However,
as Michael Watts (2001: 167) noted, the events of 1968 were far more
than a local phenomenon; over seventy countries 'had major student ­
actions during that year \[and between\] October 1967 and July 1968
there were over 2000 incidents worldwide of student protest alone'.
Furthermore, it was not just students engaged in the act of protest, the
act of anti-capitalism. According to Watts' (ibid.: 167) study, 'if one
were to add the related worker and other nonstudent demonstrations each
country in the world would, on average, have had over 20 "incidents"
over the nine-month period'. Nor was the substance of the protest
uniform; 1968 had what Watts (ibid.: 171-- 2) has described as its
Eastern, Western and Southern moments. In the first, typified by the
Prague Spring and the Cultural Revolution in China, the focus of
protests was anti-bureaucratic, and directed against the 'Old Left' and
the corruption people perceived in it. In the second, typified by
student protests in Paris and Berkeley, the focus of protests was
opposition to consumerism and the pursuit of civil and social rights. In
the third, the focus was the rejection of authority in the first
generation of independent states in Africa and Latin America, where
military dictatorship had displaced democratic rule.

Luc Boltanski (2002: 6) also highlights the diversity of the 1968
movement by distinguishing between its social and artistic critiques,
where the former focused on inequality and poverty stemming from
capitalism, and the latter on liberation, individual autonomy and
authenticity. Michael Löwy (2002: 95) links this distinction between the
social and artistic critique of capitalism to romanticism, which he
defines as 'rebellion against modern capitalist society, in the name of
past or premodern social and cultural values, as a protest against the
modern disenchantment of the world'. Therefore, [the significance of
1968 can be seen not just across space, but also as a reflection of
long-established traditions of resistance to prevailing social,
political and economic forms or organization. On such readings, [the
events of 1968 can be interpreted as a demonstration of long-standing
anti-capitalist feeling that rested on a critique of the world we live
in and the injustices it creates, and in turn motivated action in order
to try to address them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Calls to human rights are used to claim change but fail to make change, upholding the global order

**[A brief, and therefore necessarily superficial, survey of the
shortcomings of human rights norms and movements with the structural
transformations of the era of market fundamentalism in mind must start
with a basic and rarely made point: In their legalized forms, human
rights do not purport to provide an egalitarian agenda]{.underline}**.
It is perfectly possible to imagine a fully achieved local and global
regime of human rights protection that simultaneously features the worst
hierarchy of wealth and other primary goods known to history. Indeed, in
some ways, grasping the paradoxical relationship of human rights and
so-called neoliberalism amounts to seeing how thorough a disjuncture
there is between an agenda of economic and social rights protection and
a more ambitious egalitarian agenda.45 When it comes to the sorts of
goals envisioned by the International Covenant for Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights, it is not how much they promise but how little that
needs to receive more emphasis, since the covenant strives for a minimum
floor of protection in domains like housing, health, and food, rather
than a fuller bodied egalitarianism. [It is popular, and understandable,
to focus on those episodes]{.underline} (Pinochet's Chile, for example)
[where neoliberal policies have gone along with state
repression]{.underline}---which Klein's indictment of the shock doctrine
dramatizes (or sensationalizes). But, in certain ways, **[it seems much
more disturbing to observe that neoliberal victories are perfectly
compatible with full respect for not just civil and political liberties,
but also for economic and social rights]{.underline}**. If one
extrapolates the most extreme possible illustration of this point, **[it
is perfectly possible to imagine an alternate reality in which one man
personally owns everything, but with all the provisions of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights nonetheless honored]{.underline}** (through
his subsistence spending). Even the much-ridiculed promise in the
Universal Declaration's Article 27 of paid vacations is completely
harmonious with a world controlled by a galloping hierarchy of means.46
[Society has indeed headed towards a scenario in the last thirty years
where a formerly egalitarian impulse has sometimes successfully been
displaced, as inequality has spiked, by an agenda in which a set of
protections alleviates the most abject destitution.]{.underline}
Generalizing drastically, it is fair to say that [the present era of
world history is one in which a floor has been partially built to save
the wretched of the earth from the worst suffering, even as the ceiling
for hierarchical wealth concentration has been
obliterated]{.underline}.47 The conceptual point, in other words, is
that an economic and social rights agenda is different---and much more
minimalist---than an egalitarian agenda. It is perfectly possible for
one to succeed as the other fails. [The historical point is that the
ends of the first agenda have often been prioritized---and sometimes
achieved---across an era during which the ends of the second agenda have
been forsaken]{.underline}. But two crucial qualifications are necessary
to understand the historically juxtaposed trajectories of the two
agendas. For one thing, [for all the progress made in saving humanity
from the most extreme sorts of immiseration]{.underline}, much remains
to be done even to provide a floor of basic protection. [No one wants to
trivialize social and economic rights protection, even in the name of a
plausible indictment of aphasia concerning broader patterns of wealth
and income distribution and rising inequality]{.underline}. **[Second,
even successes in the socioeconomic domain have hardly been due to the
application of a normative framework of human rights]{.underline}**, the
birth of a formal regime of human rights law, or the mobilizational
activism of any human rights movement. In fact, [the lion's share of
poverty reduction in the last few decades]{.underline} (indeed, given
the population numbers involved, in world history by far) [is due to a
single factor: the policies of the Chinese state]{.underline}.48 And
although a wide range of factors account for the remainder of poverty
reduction---food and water access, health improvement, and so on---it
does not seem as if human rights protection or promotion as frameworks
or projects rank high among them, if they figure on the list at all.
[Now consider this deflationary perspective about the value of economic
and social rights agendas]{.underline} (set off from the protection of
those rights achieved through other frameworks or thanks to other means)
[by starting with domestic or national protection and then turning to
more transnational and global protection]{.underline}. There is no doubt
that, after the first phase of human rights history in the 1970s and
1980s, during which a global dialogue concerning economic and social
rights was largely absent, such discourse has surged. But, sadly, this
rhetorical and framing (or, more generously, standard-setting) work has
caused no shifts in real-world outcomes independently. [This is most
graphically clear when it comes to the highly prestigious model of
judicial enforcement of socioeconomic rights, especially when national
judiciaries interpret constitutional norms in the spirit of
international human rights law]{.underline} (including by relying on its
notion of a minimum core of protection). For many years, South Africa
was credited as the laboratory where these developments were pioneered,
especially after the landmark Grootboom case.49 In particular, for
several years, some leading American academics praised the
"democracy-forcing" manner in which South African courts both advanced
socioeconomic rights and respected democratic legitimacy when it came to
policy choices.50 [On this interpretation, courts could invalidate
policies that failed to respect a designated minimum core of
socioeconomic rights protection while refusing to craft enforcement
remedies of their own, thereby prompting democratic branches of
government to do so]{.underline}.51 But, especially on this minimalist
and noninterventionist model, [the final results have been
disappointing: it turns out that the South African
judiciary]{.underline}, instead of encouraging legislative or political
action, [forced the democratic branches into a nonresponse]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, it is plausible to conclude that judicial enforcement has
failed to make a great deal of difference, both in South Africa and
beyond.52 In particular, as David Landau has shown, enforcement of
economic rights by courts tend to favor the well-off (such as pensioners
defending entitlements against state rollback under budgetary pressure)
rather than the weakest and most vulnerable.53 Of course, [the failure
of judicial enforcement of socioeconomic rights does not mean that other
attempts to protect socioeconomic rights have necessarily
failed]{.underline}. But, so far, **[there is no powerful evidence
confirming the value that a human rights framework brings to the
reformulation of citizenship in a welfarist direction thanks to other
forces]{.underline}** (for example, partisan mobilization, which Simmons
has credited for improvement when it comes to political and civil
rights).54

#### Neoliberalism has corrupted truth and moral obligation, which in turn destroys political agency and denies effective governance. The elimination of these core tenets of freedom justifies racism and structural inequality \-\-- turns the aff.

Politics of Neoliberal Fascism,

-TB

**[The Crisis of Reason and Fantasies of Freedom]{.underline}** As more
and more power is concentrated in the hands of a corporate and financial
elite, [freedom is defined exclusively in market terms, inequality is
cast as a virtue, and the logic of privatization heaps contempt upon
civic compassion and the welfare state. **The fatal after-effect is that
neoliberalism has emerged as the new face of fascism.**]{.underline}
\[14\] With the fifty-year advance of neoliberalism, freedom has become
its opposite. And [democracy once the arc of civic freedom now becomes
its enemy since democratic governance no longer takes priority over the
unchecked workings of the market.]{.underline} **[Neoliberalism
undermines both the social and the public and in doing so weakens the
idea of shared responsibilities and moral obligations.]{.underline}** As
Zygmunt Bauman argues "ethical tranquilization" is now normalized under
the assumption that freedom is limited to the right to only advance
one's own interests and the interests of the markets.\[15\] **[Freedom
in the neoliberal playbook disavows any notion of responsibility outside
of the responsibility to oneself.]{.underline}** As Wendy Brown argues,
politics and democracy are now viewed as the enemy of markets and
"politics is cast as the enemy to freedom, to order and to
progress."\[16\] [**Politics now becomes a mix of regressive notions of
freedom and authority whose purpose is to protect market-driven
principles and practices.** What disappears in this all-encompassing
reach of capital is the notion of civic freedom, which is replaced by
securitization organized to protect the lawless workings of the profit
motive and the savagery of neoliberal austerity policies.]{.underline}
Moreover, as freedom becomes privatized, it feeds a lack of interest in
politics and breeds moral indifference. Democratic passions are directed
towards private pleasures, the demands of citizenship are undermined,
and the public sphere withers, as self-interest becomes the primary
organizing principle of society. **[As the terrain of politics, agency,
and social relations loses its moral bearings, the passions of a fascist
past are unleashed and society increasingly begins to resemble a war
culture, blood sport and form of cage fighting. In this instance the
oppressed are not only cheated out of history, they are led to believe
that under neoliberal fascism there are no alternatives and that the
future can only imitate the present.]{.underline}** Not only does this
position suppress any sense of responsibility and resistance, it
produces what Timothy Snyder calls "a kind of sleepwalking, and has to
end with a crash."\[17\] [The latter is reinforced by a government that
believes that the truth is dangerous and that reality begins with a
tweet that signals both the legitimation of endless lies and forms of
power that infantilize and depoliticize because they leave no room for
standards of language capable of holding power accountable.]{.underline}
Even worse, **[Trump's war on language and truth does more than limit
freedom to competing fictions; it also erases the distinction between
moral depravity and justice, good and evil.]{.underline}** As I have
said elsewhere, "Trump's Ministry of Fake News works incessantly to set
limits on what is thinkable claiming that reason, evidence, consistency,
and logic no longer serve the truth, because the latter are crooked
ideological devices used by enemies of the state. 'Thought crimes,' are
now labeled as 'fake news'."\[18\] Timothy Snyder is right in arguing,
**["To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no
one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so.
If nothing is true, then all is spectacle."]{.underline}** \[19\] The
post-truth society is a state-sponsored diversion and spectacle. Its
purpose is to camouflage a moral and political crisis that has put into
play a set of brutal neoliberal arrangements. Rather than view truth as
the currency of democracy, Trump and his acolytes view it and democracy
as the enemy of power. Such arrangements put both democracy at risk and
create an educational and political project receptive to the political
currency of white supremacy. As a master of schlock performance, [Trump
tweets and speaks largely to his angry resentful base often using crude
language in which the threat of violence and repression appears to
function for his audience as a source of "romance, pleasure, and
fantasy.]{.underline}"\[20\] These core supporters represent, at best,
what Philip Roth once generously called the "uneducated and
overburdened." But they also cultivate what Erin Aubry Kaplan calls
**["the very worst American impulses, from xenophobia to know-nothingism
to disdain for social necessities such as public education and clean
water \[and their\] signature quality is racism."]{.underline}**\[21\]

Industrialist and philanthropist, lobbyist and cultural leader: [Samuel
Galton Jr. was in 1795 a prominent member of Birmingham's
bourgeoisie]{.underline}. [He was also a pacifist]{.underline} Quaker,
from a family that had long been prominent in the Society of Friends,
and likely the leading gun manufacturer for Britain's massive war
machine. [In 1795 the Society of Friends Meeting in Birmingham finally
called Galton's gun manufacturing into question and ultimately expelled
him]{.underline}. But Galton rejected the arguments of his inquisitors.
[He defended himself by insisting that it was arbitrary to single out a
weapons manufacturer]{.underline}. **[All merchants and industrialists,
he suggested, fed the enormous appetite of the British war-making
state.]{.underline}** Bankers and merchants floated loans, and British
capital markets grew primarily to finance the ceaseless wars of the 18th
century. **[Not just gun makers but also iron, leather, textile, and
food manufacturers all grew and profited through lucrative, large-scale
contracting with the war-making state. The whole economy was a war
economy]{.underline}**, Galton concluded, and it was arbitrary to
narrowly condemn his business. Galton's defense of his pacifist faith
and bellicose occupation is the hook for Priya Satia's Empire of Guns.
From local Quaker mercantile and financial networks in Birmingham to
global demand for guns and gun making in Britain's empire, [we see the
origins of capitalism soaked in the bloody circuits of the gun trade and
warfare]{.underline}. [The war-making state of the 18th century provided
industrialists with a unique kind of demand. It purchased food,
uniforms, weapons, and other supplies on a scale that made mass
production attractive and necessary.]{.underline} Empire of Guns offers
a history of the 18th-century economy that validates Galton's belief
that military contracting and demand permeated virtually every aspect of
production, exchange, and finance. **[This history of guns underlines a
deeper affinity among the state, violence, and
capitalism]{.underline}**. [The rise of capitalism was marked not by the
retreat of a rule-bound liberal state but by the expansion of a massive
fiscal and military apparatus that extracted revenue, swept up
production, shaped demand, and projected power across
empires.]{.underline} Satia offers an account of the flows of resources
and influences that stitched together guns, empire, and industrial
capitalism. Eighteenth-century Britain was a "military-industrial
society," built out of diffuse and overlapping networks among
arms-making contractors, the Board of Ordnance, and imperial chartered
companies such as the East India Company[. The line between public and
private, government work and private enterprise was not yet formalized
in this world of gentlemen's agreements. Satia's networked conception of
a military-industrial society contrasts with the formalized,
concentrated, and bureaucratic apparatus of the military-industrial
complex of the 20th century]{.underline}. In both, the state was
central, but the networks of trust, credit, and finance of the 18th
century were very different from the integrated research bureaucracies
that bridged the academy, the military, and Fordist firms in the 20th.
[This entangled network of relationships among the Board of Ordnance,
arms-making contractors, and semi-state, semi-corporate chartered
companies]{.underline} (foremost the East India Company) [channeled
flows of resources into the gun-making industry, and, for Satia, created
a structure of demand that was central to the industrial revolution
itself]{.underline}. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, although the
specific processes of gun making remained in the hands of artisanal
ironworkers, government officials commanded proofhouses and planned gun
production, so that the state ran "a kind of virtual factory: a highly
subdivided and efficient system of mass production, but too inclusive to
house under a single roof." Satia makes a compelling case that "[state
institutions drove Britain's industrial revolution," and she highlights
the centrality of empire in British state capacity.]{.underline} [The
East India Company, a major purchaser of arms, provided crucial guidance
on weapon designs that "an expanded and reorganized military-industrial
society could produce in mass quantities on a new order of
magnitude]{.underline}." [The company also stifled arms manufacture in
its colonial territory, despite expert inspectors finding the guns made
in India to be superior in some cases.]{.underline} East India Company
demand for weapons from England was critical in driving gun-making
innovation, while at the same time the company carefully reoriented
Indian economic development to serve the colonizers' interests. Thus
**[it was the state, and its semi-state imperial vanguard, the East
India Company, that brought "revolution ... to the gun
industry]{.underline}**." State-led experiments with machinery,
coordination through a contractors' cartel, new apprenticeship
regulations, and bounties transformed the "internal structures of the
artisanal system so that it could produce on a mass scale," boosting
production from 3,000 guns per week in 1790 to 14,000 per week after
1803. Deeply rooted in the archives of the mercantile families of
Birmingham, the craft workshops of the gun trade, and the intricacies of
the imperial state's contracting system, Empire of Guns offers a
sweeping revision of the history of the origins of the industrial
revolution and the nature of capitalism itself. [Satia forces us to
reconsider some of our foundational assumptions about political economy.
Much like Sven Beckert's Empire of Cotton, Satia's Empire of Guns puts
state power and violence at the center of the emergence and growth of
capitalism]{.underline}. Her account shares important interpretative
terrain with Beckert's book, which argued [for "war capitalism"---a
historically specific conjuncture of state power, merchants, and
violence as the foundation for the first industrial revolution, in
cotton textiles]{.underline}. This move to center state power marks a
departure in recent histories of capitalism. Certainly, outstanding
recent work on securities, public debt, and financial risk has been
closely attuned to politics and public policy. In addition, since Peter
Evans, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, and Theda Skocpol issued their call to
"bring the state back in," many [scholars in the fields of American
political development, legal history, and political economy have focused
on the role of public policy in constituting, shaping, and directing
capitalism. But if this work has successfully chipped away at the
liberal core underpinning most conceptions of political
economy]{.underline} (even Marxist ones), [a liberal pillar still stands
that sees politics and state power as reacting to and regulating the
primary drivers of the capitalist economy]{.underline}. [Satia pushes us
toward a more radical recasting of our understanding of the state in the
history of capitalism]{.underline}. What if we need to flip the script?
What if expansive state power should come first in our understanding of
what is distinctive about capitalism? Satia suggests that [it was
uniquely powerful states with extensive infrastructural, fiscal, and
war-making capacity that created the foundation for modern
capitalism]{.underline}. Indeed, it seems that compared to all other
political economies throughout history, capitalist political economies
have been uniquely characterized by ever more powerful states. A sign of
an enduring liberal dichotomy of state and economy is a preoccupation
with regulation (state vs. markets) as a measure of state capacity.
Satia's work stresses [instead the flows of resources that integrate the
state into the heart of the political economy through extraction
(taxation) and, in Empire of Guns, allocation (spending]{.underline}).
**[Because governments require resources to make war, purchase guns,
and, after the 18th century, finance infrastructure, fund schools,
provide social insurance, and incarcerate the poor, the share of the
economy that governments capture through taxation is an essential
indicator of the scale of state capacity over time.]{.underline}**
Fiscal history is decidedly unsexy, but taxes, budgets, and spending are
the sinews of state power. And taxes just keep going up. During the
imperial climacteric at the end of the 18th century, Britain, as one of
the most successful fiscal-military states in Europe, was able to
extract 10 to 15 percent of GDP in taxation, tripling the single-digit
rates for early modern states and more than doubling the state capacity
of the Roman Empire at its height.1 [Despite Third Way pronouncements
from centrist politicians like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair that the "era
of big government is over," governments have never been
larger]{.underline}. From 1965 to 2015, the OECD average for total
taxation as a percentage of GDP rose from 25 percent to nearly 35
percent. [Thatcher and Reagan prevailed on the terrain of ideology but
failed to slow the growth of the state. In an era of neoliberal
political hegemony, it's not surprising that the durable growth of state
power across the history of capitalism has been largely
invisible]{.underline}. From guns in the 18th century to pensions and
prisons in the 21st century, the state has continued to expand. Ignored
by most but a small niche of econometricians, this durable trajectory
carries the tag "Wagner's Law," named after the German economist who
first observed the statist tendency of capitalism in the late 19th
century. [Liberalism has been a powerful political project for
capitalist elites, providing a universalistic language with which to
first denounce aristocratic privilege and later reject the
redistributive claims of working-class parties. But liberal conceptions
of political economy have never offered an accurate guide to
understanding the movements of capitalism itself]{.underline}. Satia
might have helped her account by not overstating the novelty of her
approach. [While it may be that "the myth of pacific British
industrialism" still dominates many textbooks, it is not quite fair to
introduce the project by claiming that "no one has explained how
constant war impinged on the grand economic narrative of the time, the
industrial revolution."]{.underline} Charles Tilly, for instance,
devoted much of his prolific scholarship to the intertwined development
of states, war making, and modern capitalism. Researchers across the
social sciences continue to engage with and expand on Tilly's
"bellicist" tradition of historical sociology. Within the field of
British and global economic history, Patrick K. O'Brien has also written
extensively on how **[British empire and war making proved crucial for
driving forward the industrial revolution]{.underline}**. Nevertheless,
Satia's work does mark a new moment of clarity in a long tradition.
**[Empire of Guns calls on us to recast our understanding of capitalist
political economies, foregrounding the violent and state-led origins of
capitalism]{.underline}**. **[Satia urges us to put the "political" back
into "political economy," with a full view of the imperial, coercive,
coordinating, and contracting capacity of the state]{.underline}**. But
there is also need for caution and reflection. [Economic historians have
approached recent histories of capitalism with considerable
skepticism]{.underline}.2 A rapprochement between the rigidly
quantitative approaches of economic history and the more
institutionalist, cultural, and political approach of historians might
be welcome, but Satia closes the door on such an engagement at the
outset, stating that any "quantitative assessment of the state's role in
the industrial revolution is both methodologically impossible and
inappropriate." Even the best, most eclectic, and wide-ranging economic
historians have astonishingly thin conceptions of politics, cultural
power, and the social history of collective action. Historians, on the
other hand, have developed a debilitating refusal (and in many cases
inability) to engage with quantitative approaches and remain more
comfortable studying the policies and procedures of regulation. But if
we want to trace the historical development of fiscal flows through
taxation, budgets, and spending, quantitative assessment of the scope
and scale of these tides, not just narrative descriptions of their
embankments, seems essential. [Engaging with quantitative arguments and
approaches does not necessarily mean getting trapped in the flattening
assumptions of liberalism and methodological individualism]{.underline}.
**[To rewrite the history of capitalism with state power at the center,
cultural, institutional, and quantitative approaches will all be
necessary. Quantification seems essential if we aim to study the state
not simply as an apparatus of regulation but as a coercive site for the
extraction and allocation of resources, whether that spending is on
guns, canals, pensions, or prisons]{.underline}**. Classical liberalism
and its 20th-century rebirth in functionalist modernization theory have
provided the central pillar around which even critical political
economies have circled. Satia shows us an opening toward rebuilding the
study of capitalism as political economy. Reconstructing the
relationships and flows of resources that tied the Birmingham gun
district to the imperial state, she situates Britain's war capitalism
within an 18th-century "military-industrial society" that transcended
entrenched boundaries between nation and empire, firms and bureaucrats,
and economy and state. **[To confront capitalism today, to reckon with
its potential and limits, we must also fundamentally confront the state
in its full coercive, extractive, and (potentially) redistributive
capacity]{.underline}**. From the 18th century to the present,
ever-expanding state power has never been exterior or ancillary, but
constitutive of capitalist political economy itself.

1.[The dynamic forces of capitalist development are]{.underline} both
[global in their reach]{.underline} and uneven in their outcomes.
Furthermore [the capital accumulation process engages both the
geo-economics of capital]{.underline}---the advance of capital in time
and place---[and the agency of the imperial state in facilitating this
advance]{.underline}: the geopolitics of capital. 2. **[Class analysis
provides an essential tool for grasping the changing economic and
political dynamics of imperial power in the various conjunctures of
capitalist development]{.underline}**. It allows us to trace out
different stages in the development of the forces of production and the
corresponding relations of production and dynamics of class struggle.
These dynamics, which we have traced out in the Latin American context,
are both internal and international, implicating both the capital-labour
relation and a north-south divide in the world capitalist system. 3.
Whereas in the 1980s [imperialism]{.underline} was called upon to remove
the obstacles to the advance of capital and to facilitate the flow of
productive investment into the region in the new millennium it [has been
called upon to assist capital in its relation of conflict with the
communities directly affected by the operations of extractive
capital]{.underline}, as well as cope with the broader resistance
movement. 4. The shift in world economic power in the new millennium,
and the new geoeconomics of capital in the region, have significant
implications for US imperialism and US-Latin American relations,
reducing both the scope of US state power and the capacity of Washington
to dictate policy or dominate economic and political relations. This is
reflected inter alia in the formation of CELAC, a new political
organisation of states that explicitly excludes the United States and
Canada, the two imperial states on the continent. 5. The new millennium,
in conditions of a heightened global demand for natural resources, the
demise of neoliberalism as an economic model and a number of popular
upheavals and mass mobilizations, released new forces of resistance and
a dynamic process of regime change. 6. The centre-left regimes that came
to power under these conditions called for public ownership of society's
wealth of natural resources, the stratification and renationalization of
privatized firms, the regulation of extractive capital in regard to its
negative impact on livelihoods and the environment (mother nature), and
the inclusionary activism of the state in securing a progressive
redistribution of wealth and income. As in the 1990s, the fundamental
agency of this political development process were the social movements
with their social base in the indigenous communities of peasant farmers
and a rural proletariat of landless or near-landless workers. These
[movements mobilized the forces of resistance against both the
neoliberal agenda of "structural reform" in macroeconomic
policy]{.underline}, the negative socio-environmental impact of
extractive capitalism, and the projection of imperial power in the
region. 7. [**These forces of change and resistance did not lead to a
break with capitalism**.]{.underline} Instead some of "[centre-left"
regimes took power and]{.underline}, benefitting from high commodity
prices, [proceeded to stimulate an economic recovery and with it an
improvement in the social condition of the population]{.underline}
(extreme poverty). [But the policies of these regimes led to the
demobilization of the social movements and a normalization of relations
with Washington]{.underline}, albeit with greater state autonomy. In
this context Washington in this period lost allies and collaborator
clients in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Bolivia, Venezuela and
Ecuador---and, subsequently faced strong opposition throughout the
region. However, Washington retained or regained clients in Panama,
Costa Rica, Honduras, Colombia, Peru, Mexico and Chile. Of equal
importance the centre-left regimes that emerged in the region stabilized
capitalism, holding the line or blocking any move to reverse the
privatization policy of earlier regimes or to move substantively towards
what President Hugo Chávez termed "the socialism of the 21st century."
8. The fluidity of US power relations with Latin America is a product of
the continuities and changes that have unfolded in Latin America. Past
hegemony continues to weigh heavily but the future augurs a continued
decline. Barring major regime breakdowns in Latin America, [the
probability is of greater divergences in policy and a sharpening of
existing contradictions between the spouting of rhetoric and political
practice on the political left.]{.underline} 9. In the sphere of
military influence and political intervention, collaborators of the US
suffered major setbacks in their attempted coups in Venezuela (2002,
2003) and Bolivia (2008), and in Ecuador with the closing of the
military base in Manta; but they were successful in Honduras (2009). The
US secured a military base agreement with Colombia, a major potential
military ally against Venezuela, in 2009. However, with a change in the
presidency in Colombia, Washington suffered a partial setback with the
reconciliation between President Chávez and Santos. A lucrative 8
billion US dollars trade agreements with Venezuela trumped Colombia's
military-base agreements with Washington. 10.It is unlikely that the
Latin American countries that are pursuing an extractivist strategy of
national development based on the extraction of natural resources and
the export of primary commodities will be able to sustain the rapid
growth in the context of contradictions that are endemic to capitalism
but that are sharper and have assumed particularly destructive form with
extractive capitalism. 11. [The destructive operations of extractive
capital, facilitated and supported by the imperial state has generated
powerful forces of resistance.]{.underline} These forces are changing
the contours of the class struggle, which today is focused less on the
land and the labour struggle than on the negative socio-environmental
impacts of extractive capital and the dynamics of imperialist plunder
and natural resource-grabbing. 12. The correlation of forces in the
anti-imperialist struggle is unclear and changing, but it is evident
that the United States has lost both power and influence. Taken together
these historical continuities argue for greater caution in assuming a
permanent shift in imperial power relations with Latin America.
Nevertheless, there are powerful reasons to consider the decline in US
power as a long-term and irreversible trend.

Rudolf Hilferding was the first Marxist scholar to draw attention to the
emergence of finance capital as the dominant form of capital in the era
of monopolies, considered to be a new stage of capitalism. At this
point, [the separation between industrial capital and finance capital
that characterised the period of competitive capitalism
disappears]{.underline}. In the classic Finance Capital of 1910,
regarded as the greatest contribution to Marxist economics of its time
(Bottomore 1985: 1), [Hilferding considered the possibility that
capitalism could achieve a degree of organisation in which it was no
longer subject to production anarchy, thereby eliminating economic
crises]{.underline}. According to Hilferding, capitalism tended to
create cartels at all economic levels. **[Ultimately, a world cartel
would arise in which all capitalist production would be rigorously
planned by a superior body that would perfectly dictate the total amount
of goods to be produced and distributed in all fields]{.underline}**.
Economic planning would even reach a point where money2 would no longer
be necessary3 (Hilferding \[1910\] 1985: 226-7). **[By restricting
production, cartels could eliminate crises deriving from the
overproduction of commodities, but not the crises derived from the
overproduction of capital]{.underline}** (Hilferding \[1910\] 1985:
278). Hence, while cartels could change the character of economic
crises, they could not eliminate them entirely. Comparing the struggle
of industrial capital for more freedom with the mercantilist period,
Hilferding (\[1910\] 1985: 314) concluded that **[finance capital in the
imperialist stage hated the anarchy of competition]{.underline}**.
[Given its interconnected interests, it preferred organisation, only to
resume competition at a higher level]{.underline}.4 Nikolai Bukharin
(\[1915\] 1986) also argued that the global economy tended to become
highly organised at the stage of monopoly capitalism. In Imperialism and
World Economy, he stated: '[Imperialism is the policy of finance
capitalism, that is, of highly developed capitalism, which presupposes a
certain maturity -- very important in this case -- of the productive
organisation']{.underline} (Bukharin \[1915\] 1986: 128). According to
Bukharin, competition and conflict between capitalists would be
eliminated at the national level and transferred to the international
arena. Therefore, [there is a double movement in Bukharin's analysis in
which capital tends to internationalise on the one hand while
penetrating the state]{.underline} (state capitalism) [on the
other]{.underline}. **[In this view, this double movement is the main
contradiction of modern capitalism, and the cause of hostilities among
the great powers]{.underline}**: the central problem for Bukharin is not
economics, but war (Callinicos 2009: 57; Brewer 1990: 111). The
capitalist system tends to overcome production anarchy, and achieve
economic planning. It is not reaching its full organisational potential
only because the world is divided into national units (Howard and King
1989: 247). As Bukharin (\[1915\] 1986: 112) noted: [Competition reaches
its maximum development: the competition of national capitalist trusts
in the world market]{.underline}. Within the limits of national
economies, competition is minimised, to outgrow, beyond these limits, to
fantastic proportions, unknown in previous historical epochs. However,
as noted by Callinicos (2009: 62), **[if capitalism has become as highly
organised as Hilferding and Bukharin expected, why believe that this
would cease within national borders]{.underline}**? According to
Bukharin (\[1915\] 1986: 129) himself[, if national trusts could reach
an agreement, imperialism would indeed cease to exist. But this would
not be possible, for political and social reasons]{.underline}. The
necessary condition for such an agreement would include an equality
among trusts in the world market. Since this was not the case, the
trusts that held a more advantageous position -- at the strictly
economic level as well as the economic-political level (the association
of capital with the state) -- would have no interest in reaching such
agreements (Bukharin \[1915\] 1986: 130-131). Within the Marxist
tradition, [the notion that capitalism could organise itself to the
point of even eliminating inter-imperialist wars was proposed by Karl
Kautsky]{.underline}. Kautsky (1914, \[1913-1914\] 2002) argued that the
fundamental thrust of imperialism lay in the distortion between industry
and agriculture in capitalist economies. This was because [the impetus
towards capital accumulation and increased production was much stronger
in industry than in agriculture]{.underline}. [This greater investment
capacity of industry would cause tension in both sectors, since for
industry to continue growing, the agricultural sector needed to continue
supplying raw materials and food]{.underline}. Therefore, imperialism
was the consequence of highly developed industrial capitalism. But this
would not be a new stage of capitalist development, as Hilferding had
argued, but the preferred policy of finance capital.5 [States would be
forced to build large national industries in order to maintain their
independence, while largely agricultural economies would
decay]{.underline} (Kautsky \[1913-1914\] 2002: 457). In this
perspective, [there is a trend towards the occupation and subordination
of agrarian countries which causes a strong rivalry between industrial
countries, and consequently an arms race]{.underline}. Kautsky
(\[1913-1914\] 2002: 459) also argued that [advanced capitalist states
tended to block the industrialisation of agrarian countries in order to
prevent the emergence of competition]{.underline}.6 However, according
to Kautsky, the conflicts among the great powers over the exploitation
of agricultural regions could not continue. [The arms race and the costs
of colonial expansion would reach a level that would impede the very
process of accumulation, and ultimately capitalist
development]{.underline}. **[Therefore, there was no need to remain in a
state of war, as this would only contribute to a single capitalist
economic sector, namely the arms industry.]{.underline}** The domination
of large monopolies over the economies of imperialist nations led to the
renunciation of the arms race in favour of an alliance for peace. That
was why ['Every far-sighted capitalist must call out to his associates:
capitalists of all lands, unite']{.underline} (Kautsky \[1913-1914\]
2002: 460).7 [This implies that capitalism reaches a certain point of
development and organisation that attenuates its contradictions until
war becomes unnecessary]{.underline}. Kautsky referred to this level of
development in which there is a transfer of the cartelisation of the
economy of developed countries to the international arena as
'ultra-imperialism'.8 Thus, in relation to Hilferding and Bukharin,
[Kautsky maximised the organisational capacity of the system by
concluding that capitalist powers would reach an agreement allowing the
reproduction of capital in a peaceful manner throughout the
world]{.underline}. From the purely economic standpoint, however,
**[there is nothing further to prevent this violent explosion from
finally replacing imperialism by a holy alliance of the imperialists.
The longer the War lasts, the more it exhausts all tile]{.underline}**
\[sic\] parti[cipants and makes them recoil from an early repetition of
armed conflict, the nearer we come to this last solution, however
unlikely it may seem at the moment]{.underline} (Kautsky 1914). The
post-World War Two golden age of capitalism under US hegemony revived
the Kautskyan idea of an ultra-imperialism (Callinicos 2009: 63).
However, in Kautsky's terms, the conditions that would prevent a new
conflagration between the powers were not met. [There was never a
reduction in military expenses, and armed conflicts did occur in several
parts of the world, even after the Cold War, when the idea of the
organisation of capitalism reached its peak under the aegis of
'globalisation']{.underline}.

#### The alt is a reorientation of our conceptions of international relations through the lens of historical materialism through denaturalizing critique of state interest to unveil the entanglement of class motivated social forces as the basis for interstate actions.

Departments of international relations should be the inevitable homes of
those who think that we cannot understand the social world without an
understanding of global processes. [Those who seek to understand the
dynamics of global social change]{.underline}, inequalities between the
many parts of the world, social injustices and the potential for
progressive social change [have often found that a global perspective is
needed]{.underline}. The message in this work has been that [these
processes need to be understood in a world historical social
context]{.underline}. In approaching the contribution of historical
materialism to contemporary international debates, my starting point was
therefore one of dual critique. We cannot take the categories of
international relations as givens, searching for instance for more
materialist explanations of traditional international realities. This is
not to deny the importance of grasping the continuities, in accounting
for the present, it is however, to argue that [we acknowledge the
radical disjuncture's of the present]{.underline}, that [we investigate
the nature of the contemporary historical change and make the evaluation
of its significance a central historical tas]{.underline}k. By the same
token however, we cannot simply take over the given tradition of Marxism
as the basis for contemporary global understanding. **[Historical
materialism has greatly enriched our grasp of the international
processes]{.underline}** but most important work has been located in a
period in which the national-international realms were first entrenched,
thus not in the present in which that duality is being transformed.
Marxists and indeed other approaches will have contributions to make.
Marx's central contribution to critical historicist thought is the
principle of historical specificity.84 My argument for example has been
that [the value of Marx's approach is enhanced if we understand it in
ways more complex]{.underline} than his own, [periodising in terms of
political, as well as production relations]{.underline} for instance.
The emancipatory thrust of Marx's social theory too, remains a powerful
impetus. Similarly the idea that social groups may become collective
actors in their own emancipation is a fundamental insight even if the
contribution of the social movements is now partially de-linked from the
role of the working class. It is true that the most fruitful
contributions to critical thought have come in recent decades from
writers, as mentioned in this work, whose main reference point have been
other than Marx. These contributions have incorporated however some of
these insight of Marx even as they have transcended a Marxist
position.85 The lessons of Marx that i have instanced may be useful
correctives to any tendency towards transhistorical categories or
generalisations, towards abstract structuralism, or towards neglect of
the emancipatory questions which are central to understanding
contemporary world changes. In the first part of this work, therefore,
our discussion has been directed to concerns how and why mainstream IR
has been reconstructed since the start of the Cold War along ahistorical
and asociological lines, given the interdisciplinary in the field of the
international before the first department of IR was established in 1919.
To the extent that [contemporary mainstream theorists have made use of
history, they have employed an instrumentalist view of it and not as a
means of rethinking the present but rather in order to confirm theories
of the present]{.underline}.86 By contrast [our argument is for the
employment of a constitutive reading of history]{.underline}, meaning
not merely an examination of history for its own sake or just so we can
delve into the past, nor basically as a means of confirming
theorisations of the present, but rather [for the purposes of rethinking
theories and problematise present views and ideas, so a reconfiguration
of the IR research agenda can be met.]{.underline} Neglecting or
bypassing history is not only a cause of injustice to the history of the
international system but it also leads to a misinterpretation of the
present.[87 Our task therefore was to reveal the **illusions of
ahistoricism** that have duped us for too long]{.underline}.
**[Reintroducing historical materialist enquiry is thus necessary to
bring into focus continuity]{.underline}**, discontinuity and
contingency that actually constitutes past and present international
debates[. The extreme claim that Marxism and IR are
incompatible]{.underline}, no less than the extreme claim that
international history and IR are incompatible,88 [is usually justified
on epistemologically bogus ground.]{.underline} It is bogus because
historians always implicitly make theoretically loaded assumptions about
the world based on their own experience in a particular time and space.
To acknowledge this should be the first task of the historian not just
of the IR theoriticians.89 [The ultimate connection between Marxism and
IR is the study of time and historical specificity]{.underline}. Social
relations do not exist apart from time and all life form is affected by
what has gone before thus for the understanding of the actual reality
one cannot ignore the past as a matter of choice.90 Accordingly, it must
be made very clear that we are not only reallocating an unproblematised
Marxist approach into the study of IR. Instead we have sought to
reformulate some lessons from historical materialism in order to
historicise IR; ironically, this leads to an approach that is no less
critical of conventional Marxism. This provides one of the most
compelling reasons why we believe the next generation of scholars should
engage in the project discussed in this work, if they are to enhance
their perspectives in IR and at the same time Marxism. [Our remedy for
the ahistorical illusions with which international relations are
understood within the mainstream, rests on the theme of a dialectical
process that constitutes international relations]{.underline}, [which is
intimately connected with re-conceiving international relations as
praxis]{.underline}. In outlining our preferred critical historical
materialist approach we have ultimately rejected vulgar materialism
which implies the traditional base/superstructure model outlined and
weightily theorised far beyond its limited capacity by a certain current
of Marxism. In turn because our prime objective is that of restoring the
role of international relations [by enhancing its research agenda to one
of giving voice to actors which harness potentially emancipatory and
liberating practices that do not simply reflect class imperatives but
also constitute the social relations of production, we have necessarily
sought to find a critical alternative to the traditional
base/superstructure]{.underline}. Hence, the solution was to go beyond
the approach of the French structuralist school and effectively
neutralise the distinction altogether, t[hereby in effect positing
international relations as constitutive of the base.]{.underline} An
overall conclusion to this work would be that [all versions
of]{.underline} critical theory generally and [**critical historical
materialism particularly are especially strong in their ability to
overcome** homo economicus reasoning and images of societies that are
atomistic, **by revealing the radical breaks between past and present,**
and in their ability to overcome the ahistorical and asociological
mainstream by denaturalising existing structures and institutions, and
thereby **revealing the present as an imminent order of change**.
Reconceptualising and re-theorising the sovereign state has been central
to the development of historical materialism of international
relations]{.underline}. [The conventional view of the state constituted
only by the competitive dynamics of the international
system]{.underline}, has been condemned as theoretically impoverished
and empirically unhelpful. [This understanding of the
state]{.underline}, which denies connections between the domestic and
the international and which attributes all casual significance to the
balance of military power between states, **[obscures the complex
interconnections between states and social forces]{.underline}**, the
mutually constitutive relationship between the domestic and the
international and the multiple factors that shape state structure and
interests. The challenge, I think for historical materialist proponents,
is to re-engage or reconceive the state and to problematise, not occlude
these complexities. This work suggests that such a reengagement is not a
novel undertaking but that [Marxism has provided a foundation for the
study of global relations]{.underline}, prior to and since the
establishment of the discipline in the early twentieth century,
particularly until the late 1980s and early 1990s. Our call for a
historicist turn in IR finds an echo in an analogous call made by
Hoffman in mid-twentieth century for a serious critique towards
approaches in pursuit for law-like understandings developed by the
behaviourist school.91 That such a critical mass should emerge at the
current time is not at all surprising. Our world is undergoing an
immense transformation, which cannot be understood with existing
theoretical means and insights needed for explaining the character of
the changes around us. **[An approach rooted in Marxist historicism can
provide an understanding of the global transformations that are taking
place]{.underline}**. This, indeed, has been the purpose of this work,
to lay out a critical historical approach in international relations on
the menu for choice; to assess the contribution of the sociological
understanding of global politics from historical materialism; to
evaluate the current work being undertaken by IR scholars that has an
historical and Marxist perspective; and to consider the future for such
an approach within the discipline. [Work done by Marxists provides a
rich framework for thinking about international politics]{.underline}
and the future for an historical materialist approach to the study of IR
is full of possibilities; even though this argument is not new, and nor
is Marxism to the study of IR. The argument has been that it was there
from the initiation of the discipline and has always remained part of
the study of the global processes, even if at times a somewhat
marginalised. I would argue that this work is, therefore not seeking a
radical reorienting of the discipline, but is suggesting a return to the
discipline's core commitment to multi-disciplinarity. In this way we are
not asking the discipline to deny its raison d'être but that it should
allow historical materialism back in.

## Framework

### FW -- Envisioning 

#### Envisioning an alternative world in which humanity prioritizes sustainability influences real choices we make that encourage reform 

- this could be a fw arg that says envisioning an alt is good even if it
  won't actually be implemented

**Giri '19** (Ananta Kumar - Madras Institute of Development Studies
Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, Beyond Cosmopolitanism Towards Planetary
Transformations)/ly

The GTI judges that global coping capacity can only greatly increase if
a powerful global citizens movement emerges. (More precisely, and as
more probable, we may think of a 'movement of movements'; Hintjens
2006.) The project's more detailed analyses show contingent pathways,
marking different possible directions beyond each phase of crisis,
according to the presence in those phases of either a weak or a strong
global citizens movement (Raskin 2006a, Figs. 9 and 10). But the
presence and strength of a movement are not sufficient. The key question
is: what type of movement? Required for a favourable transition in face
of the likely crises are elements of shared vision, a shared identity of
global citizen, and a realistic change strategy. [Only with a powerful
and well-oriented global citizens movement can even the modest Policy
Reform scenario become plausible]{.underline}, as opposed to the
observed reality during the last generation of recurrent fine-sounding
global commitments which then remain hardly implemented. [The
premise]{.underline} of a scenarios exercise, such as the GTI, [is that
people and societies have choices and that their decisions can be
**influenced by** reflection and **debate**]{.underline}. [History shows
that people's and sometimes even societies' choices can be **influenced
through envisioning alternative stories** about the future **and
responding to the perceived threats** and opportunities]{.underline}.
[Using a conceptual frame of co-evolving human-environmental systems, we
can see human values and the resulting social movements as key sets of
variables that have influence]{.underline} and that are themselves
influenced and influenceable (Raskin 2006a: 21). [Scenarios]{.underline}
themselves [can influence human attitudes]{.underline}: when we see a
storyline that offers an encouraging and plausible way forward, we are
more likely to respond, and if we see none, more likely to despond.
Exercises such as the Great Transition project aim to contribute to
processes of building helpful and widely accepted storylines. For major
societal reform, [people must perceive that they face real choices and
must feel deeply motivated to take the reform]{.underline} choice.
[Processes of societal reform thus require values as
drivers]{.underline} that help to motivate and reconfigure patterns of
action. [Humankind]{.underline}, especially its high-impact consumers
clustered mostly in high-income countries, [must be motivated towards
choices which are compatible with global sustainability.
The]{.underline} Great Transition [work posits three major]{.underline}
required [types of value change]{.underline} in order to respond to the
emerging and foreseeable crises and to move to a path of a sustainable
global society[: **1**. from consumerism, and an ideology of
life-fulfilment through buying, to a **focus** instead **on quality of
living;** **2**. from **individualism to human solidarity**, including
concern for the 'external effects' one imposes on others; **3**. from
domination of nature to **ecological sensitivity.**]{.underline} This
formulation is inspired by the work that led to the Earth Charter
(Raskin 2006a: 3). [The three value changes are presented as the inner
drivers]{.underline}, the required core content, of 'The Great
Transition'.

### FW -- Cost Benefit Analysis Bad

#### Reject their cost-benefit analysis -- it's entrenched in the neoliberal structures of arms sales

Institute of Technology Security Studies Program (Jennifer, Dangerous
Trade: Arms Exports, Human Rights, and International Reputation, p.39-40
)//SShaf

NEOLIBERALISM: ARMS TRANSFERS AND ECONOMIC GAIN [In order to commit to
and comply with international regimes, states, from a neo-liberal
perspective, must derive some mutual economic gain from cooperation or
solve a costly collective-action problem]{.underline} (Simmons 1998). In
short, self[-interested states must deem cooperation to be in their
material interest.]{.underline} Without the promise of such benefits,
regime formation is difficult to explain. [If the material benefits from
trading arms outweigh the benefits of restricting arms sales, states
will be more likely to oppose a restrictive regime]{.underline}.
Supportive [states may therefore be those that have already adopted
unilateral restrictions and wish to \"level the playing field\" to their
economic advantage]{.underline} (never mind explaining the prior
adoption of unilateral standards). Yet **[if those rare arms exporters
with existing national humanitarian standards]{.underline}**---**[such
as the United States]{.underline}** or Germany---**[were initially
reluctant to agree to similar standards on a larger scale, then the
\"level playing field\" argument loses traction]{.underline}**. Once a
regime is established, **[compliance hinges primarily on states\' desire
to receive the resulting benefits now and in the future]{.underline}**
(Keohane 1984; Simmons 1998) and secondarily [on the form of the
agreement]{.underline}. [Without compliance, the benefits from
present-day cooperation---and potential economic payoffs from related
future agreements---will not materialize.]{.underline} In this sense,
[compliance should reflect the material motivations that should be
behind states\' willingness to cooperate; compliance should again follow
commitment]{.underline}. Some neoliberals nevertheless point out that,
absent strong enforcement and monitoring mechanisms, a regime will have
trouble inducing compliance (Fortna 2003; Hafner-Burton 2005;
Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui zoos). Arms export controls have become
institutionalized in most regions, and their numbers are growing
internationally. However, because most are not subject to any costly
enforcement, their effect on state activity may be minima1.57

### FW -- Debate Key

#### We must push anti-neoliberal pedagogy into the debate space -- it is the only way to produce new ideas and escape the military-industrial-academic-cultural complex 

**Giroux 14**---(Henry A. Giroux, Chair for Scholarship in the Public
Interest​, The Paulo Freire Distinguished Scholar in Critical Pedagogy,

Such [movements are not simply about reclaiming space but
also]{.underline} about **[producing new ideas, generating new
conversations, and introducing a new political language.]{.underline}**
While there [has been considerable coverage in the progressive media
since 2001 given to the violence being waged against the movement
protesters in Brazil, the United States, Greece and
elsewher]{.underline}e, it is important to [situate]{.underline} [such
violence]{.underline} [within a broader set of categories that enables a
critical understanding of not only the underlying]{.underline} social,
economic and [political forces]{.underline} at work in such assaults,
[but also makes it possible]{.underline} to reflect critically on the
distinctiveness of the current historical period in which they are
taking place. For example, it is difficult to address such
state-sponsored violence against young people without analyzing the
devolution of the social state, emergence of a politics of
disposability, and the corresponding rise of the warfare and punishing
state. [The merging of the military-industrial-academic-cultural
complex]{.underline} an[d unbridled corporate power points to the need
for strategies that address what is specific about the current warfare
state and the neoliberal project and how different interests, modes of
power, social relations, **public pedagogies**]{.underline}, and
economic configurations [come together to shape its
politics]{.underline} of domestic terrorism, [cruelty, and zones of
disposability]{.underline}. Such a conjuncture is invaluable politically
in that it provides a theoretical opening for making the practices of
[the neoliberal revolution visible to organize resistance to its
ideologies, policies and modes of governance. It also points to the
conceptual power of making clear that history remains an open horizon
that cannot be dismissed through appeals to the end of history or end of
ideology]{.underline}.\[20\] It is precisely through the indeterminate
nature of history that resistance becomes possible and politics refuses
any guarantees and remains open. A number of neoliberal societies,
including **[the United States, have become addicted to
violence]{.underline}**. [War provides jobs, profits, political payoffs,
research funds, and forms of political and economic power that reach
into every aspect of society.]{.underline} [As war becomes a mode of
sovereignty and rule, it erodes the distinction between war and peace.
Increasingly fed by a moral and political frenzy, warlike values produce
and endorse shared fears as the primary register of social
relations]{.underline}. Shared fears and the media-induced panics that
feed them produce more than a culture of fear. Such
[hysteria]{.underline} also **[feeds the growing militarization of the
police]{.underline}**, who increasingly use their high-tech scanners,
surveillance cameras and toxic chemicals on anyone who engages in
peaceful protests against the warfare and corporate state. **[Images
abound in the mainstream media of such abuses.]{.underline}** As a mode
of public pedagogy, [a state of permanent war needs willing subjects to
abide by its values]{.underline}, ideology and [narratives of fear and
violence.]{.underline} Such [legitimation is largely provided through a
market-driven culture addicted to production of consumerism, militarism,
and organized violence,]{.underline} largely circulated through various
registers of popular culture that extend from high fashion and Hollywood
movies to the creation of violent video games and music concerts
sponsored by the Pentagon. [The market-driven spectacle of war demands a
culture of conformity]{.underline}, quiet intellectuals and a largely
passive republic of consumers. But [it also needs subjects who find
intense pleasure in the spectacle of violence.]{.underline}

#### We must recognize that we have a choice in order to dismantle neoliberalism---public debate is a critical arena

**Hay**, Professor of [Political
Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_Science) at the
[University of
Sheffield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sheffield)**04**
(Colin, "The normalizing role of rationalist assumptions in the
institutional embedding of neoliberalism", Economy and Society 33:4,
2004, Taylor and Francis)

Accordingly, [however depoliticized and normalized neoliberalism has
become, it remains a political and economic choice, not a simple
necessity.]{.underline} This brings us naturally to the question of
alternatives. A number of points might here be made which follow fairly
directly from the above analysis. First, [our ability to offer
alternatives to neoliberalism rests now on our ability to identify that
there is a choic]{.underline}e in such matters [and]{.underline}, in so
doing, [to demystify and deconstruct the rationalist premises upon which
its public legitimation has been predicated]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline}, it would seem, [is a condition of the return of a
more normative and engaging form of politics]{.underline} in which more
is at stake than the personnel to administer a largely agreed and
ostensibly technical neoliberal reform agenda. Second, the present
custodians of neoliberalism are, in many cases, reluctant converts,
whose accommodation to neoliberalism is essentially borne of perceived
pragmatism and necessity rather than out of any deep 522 Economy and
Society Downloaded by \[Emory University\] at 12:12 28 June 2013
normative commitment to the sanctity of the market. Thus, rather than
defend neoliberalism publicly and in its own terms, they have sought
instead to appeal to the absence of a choice which might be defended in
such terms. Consequently, [political discourse is technocratic rather
than political]{.underline}. Furthermore, as Peter Burnham has recently
noted, [neoliberalism is itself a deeply depoliticizing
paradigm]{.underline} (2001), [whose effect is to subordinate social and
political prioritie]{.underline}s, such as might arise from a more
dialogic, responsive and democratic politics, [to perceived economic
imperatives and to the ruthless efficiency of the market.]{.underline}
As I have sought to demonstrate, this antipathy to 'politics' is a
direct correlate of public choice theory's projection of its most
cherished assumption of instrumental rationality onto public officials.
[This]{.underline} is an important point, for it [suggests the crucial
role played by stylized rationalist assumptions]{.underline},
particularly (as in the overload thesis, public choice theory more
generally and even the time-inconsistency thesis) those which relate to
the rational conduct of public officials, in contributing to the
depoliticizing dynamics now reflected in political disaffection and
disengagement. As this perhaps serves to indicate, [seemingly innocent
assumptions may have alarmingly cumulative consequences]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the internalization of a neoliberalism predicated on
rationalist assumptions may well serve to render the so-called 'rational
voter paradox' something of a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}.12
The rational voter paradox \_/ that in a democratic polity in which
parties behave in a 'rational' manner it is irrational for citizens to
vote (since the chances of the vote they cast proving decisive are
negligible) \_/ has always been seen as the central weakness of rational
choice theory as a set of analytical techniques for exploring electoral
competition. Yet, as the above analysis suggests, in a world constructed
in the image of rationalist assumptions, it may become depressingly
accurate. Political parties behaving in a narrowly 'rational' manner,
assuming others (electors and market participants) to behave in a
similarly 'rational' fashion will contribute to a dynamic which sees
real electors (rational or otherwise) disengage in increasing numbers
from the facade of electoral competition. That this is so is only
reinforced by a final factor. [The institutionalization and
normalization of neoliberalism in many advanced liberal democracies in
recent years have been defended in largely technical and rationalist
terms and in a manner almost entirely inaccessible to public political
scrutiny, contestation and debate]{.underline}. [The electorate, in
recent years, has not been invited to choose between competing
programmatic mandates]{.underline} to be delivered in office, but to
pass a judgement on the credibility and competence of the respective
candidates for high office to behave in the appropriate (technical)
manner in response to contingent external stimuli. Is it any wonder that
they have chosen, in increa increasing numbers, not to exercise any such
judgement at all at the ballot box?

### FW -- Epistemology

#### Reject their evidence -- neoliberalism means narratives for human rights are funded through war crimes. That means all of it is suspect.

[Media Propaganda The corporate media, which constitutes the propaganda
arm of the New World Order, has a long history whereby intelligence ops
oversee the news chain]{.underline}. In turn, [the corporate media
serves the useful purpose of obfuscating war crimes]{.underline}, [of
presenting a humanitarian narrative]{.underline} which upholds the
legitimacy of politicians in high office. [Acts of war and economic
destabilization are granted legitimacy]{.underline}. **[War is presented
as a peace-keeping undertaking.]{.underline}** Both [the global economy
as well as the political fabric of Western capitalism have become
criminalized]{.underline}. The judicial apparatus at a national level as
well [the various international human rights tribunals]{.underline} and

course significant divisions and capitalist rivalry within the corporate
establishment. In the post Cold War era, [the US hegemonic project

Brazil and Argentina.]{.underline} In recent developments, [the US has
also exerted pressure on the capitalist structures of the member states

election of heads of State including Germany and France, which are
increasingly aligned with Washington. **[The monetary dimensions are

trade has become an instrument of enrichment at the expense of the real

earnings]{.underline} (deposited in tax free corporate charities) [are
also recycled towards the corporate control of politicians, civil
society organizations, not to mention scientists and intellectuals. It's
called corruption, co-optation, fraud.]{.underline}

### FW -- Process

#### Neoliberalism must be examined as a process -- no interpretation of neoliberalism exists independently.

**Springer**, Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography at the
University of Victoria, Canada, **2012** (Simon, "Neoliberalism as
discourse: between Foucauldian political economy and

Marxian poststructuralism," Critical Discourse Studies, Vol. 9, No. 2,
May 2012, 133--147, 2012,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17405904.2012.656375)

Nonetheless, following Ward and England (2007) within the existing
literature, [we can identify four different understandings of
neoliberalism: (1) Neoliberalism as an ideological hegemonic
project]{.underline}. This understanding maintains thatelite actors and
dominant groups organized around transnational class-based allianceshave
the capacity to project and circulate a coherent program of
interpretations andimages of the world onto others. This is not merely
subordination to particular coerciveimpositions, but also involves a
degree of willing consent. Attention is focused on thepeople and ideas
behind the conceptual origin of neoliberalism, as well as those whoare
at the forefront of its adoption in a range of geographical settings
(see Cox, 2002;Dume´nil&Le´vy, 2004; Harvey, 2005; Peet, 2002; Plehwe et
al., 2006).([2) Neoliberalism as policy and program]{.underline}. This
frame of reference focuses on the transfer ofownership from the state or
public holdings to the private sector or corporate interests,which
necessarily involves a conceptual reworking of the meaning these
categories hold.The understanding itself is premised on the idea that
opening collectively held resourcesto market mediation engenders greater
efficiency. The usual motifs under which suchpolicy and program are
advanced include privatization, deregulation,
liberalization,depoliticization, and monetarism (see Brenner & Theodore,
2002; Klepeis& Vance,2003; Martinez & Garcia, 2000).[3) Neoliberalism as
state form.]{.underline}In this understanding, neoliberalism is
considered as aprocess of transformation that states purposefully engage
in to remain economicallycompetitive within a transnational playing
field of similarly minded states. This isthought to involve both a
quantitative axis of destruction and discreditation wherebystate
capacities and potentialities are 'rolled back', and a qualitative axis
of constructionand consolidation, wherein reconfigured institutional
mediations, economic managementsystems, and invasive social agendas
centered on urban order, surveillance, immigrationissues, and policing
are 'rolled out' (see Peck, 2001; Peck &Tickell, 2002).([4)
Neoliberalism as governmentality]{.underline}. This interpretation of
neoliberalism centers onacknowledging a processual character where
neoliberalism's articulation with existingcircumstances comes through
endlessly unfolding failures and successes in the relationsbetween
peoples and their socially constructed realities as they are
(re)imagined, (re)interpreted,and (re)assembled to influence forms of
knowledge through 'the conduct ofconduct' (Barry, Osborne, & Rose, 1996;
Brown, 2003; Ferguson & Gupta, 2002;Larner, 2003; Lemke, 2002). This
understanding implies power as a complex, yetvery specific form
centering on knowledge production through the ensemble of
rationalities,strategies, technologies, and techniques concerning the
mentality of rule thatallow for the de-centering of government through
the active role of auto-regulated orauto-correcting selves who
facilitate 'governance at a distance' (Foucault, 1991a).Thus, the
internal dynamics of neoliberalism in this understanding are underpinned
byan unquestioned 'commonsense', meaning quite literally, a sense held
in common.Given that scholars of neoliberalism typically amalgamate two
or more of these views on neoliberalism,my alignment of the studies
cited in each understanding of neoliberalism remainsopen to reader
interpretation. Potential misgivings over the associations I have made
withregard to particular scholar's views on neoliberalism actually
reinforces my argument that[each interpretation of neoliberalism does
not exist in isolation, but is actually connected to and recursive of
the alternative views]{.underline}. Recent contributions demonstrate a
growing readinessto sift through the methodological, epistemological,
and ontological differences between thesefour definitions (see Larner,
2003; Peck, 2004; Peet, 2007), even if particular views on
neoliberalismneoliberalismstill come through. Nonetheless, important
'middle ground' inquires are emerging, whereGilbert (2005), Raco (2005),
and McCarthy (2006) all develop more amalgamated interpretations.Yet
truly hybridized approaches that attempt to synthesize or at least
reconcile thesedivergent conceptions in any sustained sense are much
less common. A series of progressreports by Sparke (2004, 2006, 2008)
offers a notably rare exception. [Concatenating such divergent
theorizations is clearly no small task, as it is one that necessarily
involves reconciling the Marxian political economy perspective of
hegemonic ideology with poststructuralist conceptualizations of
governmentality, where policy and program along with state form
approaches fall somewhere in between]{.underline}. For Barnett (2005)
the potential of such an exercise is entirely unconvincingas the two
intellectual projects imply different models of the nature of
explanatory concepts,of causality and determination, of social relations
and agency, and different normative understandingsof political power.
Thus, he argues, '[We should not finesse these differences away by
presuming that the two approaches converge around a common real-world
referent']{.underline}(Barnett, 2005, p. 8). Similarly, Castree (2006,
p. 3) disavows what he calls the 'both/andagenda' for its 'intractable
inability to "fix" \[neoliberalism's\] meanings with real-world
referents'stemming from the use of multiple definitions where '"the real
world" can only partly functionas a "court of appeal" to resolve
competing claims as to what is (or is not) neoliberal indegree or kind'.
Castree (2006, p. 3) uses the peculiar analogy of water to illustrate
his point,taking its meaning from positivist scientism as having liquid,
gas, and solid forms, yet alwaysremaining water 'wherever and whenever
it is'. This comparison, however, belies a faux realismas it fails to
consider how different languages, cultures, and individuals may have
very differentmeanings for and understandings of 'water in general'. The
idea that Inuit peoples have hundredsof words for the English language
equivalent of 'snow' is an anthropological myth (Martin,1986), but it is
nonetheless instructive of how 'the real world' can be viewed as little
morethan a semiotic construction, where even something as seemingly
universal as water may bereduced to competing claims as to what it is
(or is not) in degree or kind. In other words, Castree (2006) engages a
very narrowly and privately defined understanding of the 'real',which is
mobilized as a cipher for his own idealism.

#### Neoliberalism must be understood as a process and a hybrid. -- it should be understood as the means not the ends.

**Springer**, Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography at the
University of Victoria, Canada, **2012** (Simon, "Neoliberalism as
discourse: between Foucauldian political economy and

Marxian poststructuralism," Critical Discourse Studies, Vol. 9, No. 2,

http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17405904.2012.656375)

On the other hand, some have called for a moment of pause, suggesting
that we should be wary of overly concrete or introspective analyses of
the local, as such accounts inadequately attend to the principal
attributes and meaningful bonds of neoliberalism as a global
project(Brenner & Theodore, 2002; Peck &Tickell, 2002). [The 'larger
conversation' that neoliberalism provokes is regarded as imperative in
connecting similar patterns of experiences across space, which may serve
as a potential basis for building solidarities]{.underline} (see Brand
&Wissen, 2005;Escobar, 2001; Featherstone, 2005; Kohl, 2006; Routledge,
2003; Springer, 2008, 2011b;Willis, Smith, &Stenning, 2008). Thus
neoliberalism as a concept allows poverty and inequalityexperienced
across multiple sites to find a point of similitude, whereas
disarticulation underminesefforts to build and sustain shared aims of
resistance beyond the micro-politics of thelocal. Accordingly,
[conceptualizing neoliberalism requires an appreciation of the elaborate
and fluctuating interchange between the local and extralocal forces at
work within the global political economy]{.underline} (Brenner &
Theodore, 2002; Ferguson & Gupta, 2002; Peck, 2001). Ong (2007,p. 3)
corroborates this notion by conceptualizing 'big N Neoliberalism' as 'a
fixed set of attributeswith predetermined outcomes', while 'small n
neoliberalism' operates in practice 'as alogic of governing that
mitigates and is selectively taken up in diverse political contexts'.
Inthis light, Peck and Tickell (2002, p. 383) propose 'a processual
conception of neoliberalizationas both an "out there" and "in here"
phenomenon whose effects are necessarily variegated anduneven, but the
incidence and diffusion of which may present clues to a pervasive
"metalogic".[Like globalization, neoliberalization should be understood
as a process, not an end-state'. Thus,
neoliberalism-cum-neoliberalization can be viewed as a plural set of
ideas emanating from both everywhere and nowhere within diffused loci of
power]{.underline} (Plehwe&Walpen, 2006). [The inability to
straightforwardly align neoliberalism to particular individuals,
organizations, or states, and the further recognition that there is no
'pure' or 'paradigmatic' version of neoliberalism, but rather a series
of geopolitically distinct and institutionally effected
hybrids]{.underline} (Peck, 2004),[plays a significant role in the
difficulty of realizing consensus on a conceptual definition of
'neoliberalism in general']{.underline}. Neoliberalism, it would seem is
simply too nebulous to isolate or determine (McCarthy &Prudham, 2004).

### FW -- Discourse 

#### Neoliberalism has invaded every level of discourse and society 

**Pauliny 16** (Tara Pauliny, Assistant Professor John Jay college of
criminal justice, 2016, Neoliberal Rhetorics and Body Politics:
Plastinate Exhibits as Infiltration, Lexington books, pg. 19-22)///PSC

[While the term neoliberalism has been taken up by scholars and
economists, "neoliberal" or "neoliberalism" is not just economic but
cultural]{.underline} (see Duggan). Despite this seeming invisibility,
BODIES...The Exhibition and BODY WORLDS is a reflection of the fact
that, within the last thirty years, [neoliberalism has become a
pervasive force in everyday life]{.underline}. [Its vocabulary of
"self-control," "personal responsibility," and "individual freedom" has
infiltrated cultures across the globe]{.underline} and can be seen in
such varied places as economic policy discussions where politicians call
for market deregulation,5 [commercials for prescription drugs where
consumers are told it is their "right" to be treated for any number of
ailments,]{.underline}6 [and World Bank films that link the potential
improvement in the lives of people with disabilities to their "personal
tenacity" rather than external forces]{.underline}.7 As well, scholars
have shown that neoliberal discourse has penetrated the 2004 US
presidential campaign (Angelique Haugerud), contemporary discussions
about GLBT and immigrant bodies (Jennifer Wingard), understandings of
Harlem's recent transformation into a middle class neighborhood (Sandhya
Shukla), public policy writing (Rebecca Dingo), and even within the
performance of wealth in religious television programs (Marla
Frederick).8 [While this work varies in its approach, argument, and
application, it all echoes Susan Braedley and Meg Luxton's claim that
neoliberalism is a "political force with which most people in the world
must reckon,]{.underline}" ("Competing Philosophies" 3)9 [and Henry
Giroux' claim that neoliberalism is a "political project of governing
and persuasion intent on producing new forms of subjectivity and
particular modes of conduct]{.underline}" (Against Terror 1). Based on
this scholarship, it is clear that, **[while neoliberalism in its most
formal sense is defined as a set of economic theories and practices that
seek to free the market from governmental constraints, it has greatly
exceeded these boundaries]{.underline}**.10 **[Neoliberalism is now
understood simultaneously as an economic policy, a system of
governmentality, and an ideological force]{.underline}**. It influences
and is influenced by cultural practices, gender ideology, public policy,
and---as I argue later in the book---the relationship between
nation-states, pedagogical consumerism, and the formation of
contemporary subjectivity. To situate and contextualize the reading of
neoliberalism that I offer in the subsequent chapters, and to clarify my
own use of the term and its shifting influences, I offer here a brief
overview of the definition and development of neoliberalism. The turn
toward neoliberalism globally began in the 1970s as a set of
"political-economic practices and thinking" (Harvey 2). Since then,
**[it has proliferated into a "hegemonic mode of discourse" that has so
invaded our consciousness that it has become part of the "common-sense"
way many people "interpret, live in, and understand the
world]{.underline}**" (3). Prior to this late twentieth-century shift,
embedded liberalism was the driving economic approach in the West. This
approach gained hold in the early to middle of the twentieth century,
when it came in reaction to the aftermath of the first and second World
Wars. Amid this chaos and reconstruction, [there was a general desire to
construct a system of governmentality that would be both democratic and
able to "guarantee peace, inclusion, well-being, and
stability"]{.underline} (Harvey quoting Dahl and Lindblom 10).
[Internationally, liberalism took hold]{.underline} through the Bretton
Woods agreements (which fixed exchange rates that were backed by gold
reserves), [and the creation of institutions such as the UN, the World
Bank, the IMF, and the Bank of International Settlements.]{.underline}
In the West this resulted in the market and other private activities
being regulated by social and political restraints and the creation of a
system of public welfare.11 [Neoliberalism is often defined as a
response to liberalism's failures---namely high inflation and
stagnation---and its goal to uncouple the market from constraints has
engendered a move away from a system of protections by the nation-state
and toward a system of individual reliance and personal
responsibility.]{.underline} So, whereas liberal governmentality was
marked by an ethic of care for its citizens through publically funded
social welfare programs and public institutions, neoliberal
governmentality expects the private sector to fill these needs.
Historically, the rise of neoliberalism is often traced back to the Mont
Perelin Society (MPS). This group emerged as a global force in the early
1970s and was named for the Swiss spa where historians, academic
economists, and philosophers gathered around the Austrian political
philosopher Friedrich von Hayek. It opposed embedded liberalism (also
knows as Keynesian theory) and was backed by a variety of wealthy and
corporate leaders, many of them US citizens. [The MPS fostered a number
of related organizations, including the Heritage Foundation in
Washington and the Institute of Economic Affairs in London]{.underline}.
Another important proponent of neoliberalism was Milton Friedman, an
economist who taught at the University of Chicago for over thirty years,
and who served as an advisor to President Nixon. Under the control of
Sweden's banking leaders, Hayek won the Nobel Prize for economics in
1974 followed by Friedman who was then bestowed with the honor in 1976.
These events, among others, confirmed that neoliberalism was a driving
force within economic circles whose power coalesced in 1979 with the
election of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party in the United
Kingdom.12 During this time, both the United States and the United
Kingdom moved away from Keynesian fiscal principles in favor of
neoliberal-influenced policies. In the United States, Paul Volker, the
chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank, initiated a system of
deregulation, interest rate increases, and tax cuts to manage inflation;
these policies were further ingrained into US policy, and Volker was
reappointed to the Federal Reserve. Ultimately, in the 1990s, the
Washington Consensus signaled the near achievement of neoliberalism's
goal of free markets, privatization, and fiscal austerity and set
neoliberalism on its course to becoming the ubiquitous force it is
today. And this influence can be measured both fiscally and culturally.
Wealth inequality, for example, increased exponentially: in 1978, the
top 0.01 percent of income earners in the US held two percent of the
country's wealth, but by 1999 that number climbed to over six percent.
Likewise, the ratio of the median compensation of workers to the
salaries of CEOs increased from just over 30--1 in 1970 to 500--1 by
2000 (Harvey 15--16). **[Neoliberalism's influence did not stop at the
economic level, however]{.underline}**. **[From the 1970s through today,
this ideology has radiated into almost all facets of life. Cultural
manifestations have normalized this fiscal phenomena and neoliberalism's
lexicon has become a mainstay of public discourse as it has been
transfigured from economic philosophy to a common place.]{.underline}**
As Aihwa Ong maintains, neoliberal policies are "accompanied by a
proliferation of techniques to remake the social and citizen-subjects,"
and it is through these subjects that neoliberalism is enacted
(Neoliberalism as Exception 14). [Reflecting the other side of the
political spectrum, Margaret Thatcher also claimed that, according to
neoliberal philosophy, there is "no society," only "individual men and
women"---and it is through these individuals, these
citizen-subjects---that neoliberalism's cultural campaign has been
waged.]{.underline}

#### Restricting the arms trade [legitimizes]{.underline} capitalistic ventures and fosters [profit-driven]{.underline} wars---the plan props up the defense industry with public fear and support 

**Sandhu '16** (Kam, Journalist, Writer, and Editor for Real Media, "The
Borders of Capitalism: Nazis, Refugees and the Arms Trade," Real Media,
2016,

JLin)

At the minute, what's happening [in Yemen, the hypocrisy of the
government's support for the arms trade is so clear]{.underline} because
you've got the department for international development giving a few
millions worth of aid to Yemen, and you sit on the underground with
posters saying we need to send blankets to people in a conflict zone,
and then you've got the UK government selling weapons to our biggest
customer Saudi Arabia, who is currently bombing Yemen. You've got the
British government sending military advisers to work alongside Saudi
Arabia which is directly fuelling this conflict. Three days after the
events in Dover, on 2nd February, another protest took place. This time,
at the Hilton Hotel, Park Lane as guests arrived in black tie for an
annual dinner. [The UK government is complicit in that war.]{.underline}
British bombs are being dropped and it's causing a really severe
humanitarian crisis. Whereas at first it was campaigns and rights groups
talking about this, last week the UN Security Council put out a report
saying that there is evidence of repeated and systematic abuses of
International Humanitarian Law which means Saudi Arabia has been
targeting civilians and civilian objects which is illegal. So Mosques,
schools, weddings, MSF hospitals are being bombed kind of
indiscriminately -- the UN said that last week. And just this week, the
UK Parliament International Development Select Committee has called for
the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia on the same day these arms
dealers are wining and dining MPs. The event was the ADS dinner -- ADS
is the arms industry trades body, who host several events throughout the
year. This dinner was their \"big annual extravaganza\" says Sarah
Reader, an anti-arms trade activist. Tickets were £250-a-head for ADS
members and £450 for those not. I think it's really important to take
action at these dinners because **[it's very easy for the people there
to insulate themselves from the impact of these weapons]{.underline}**,
so when you're inside the Hilton off Mayfair and everyone's dressed in
bow-tie and drinking champagne, I feel like it's easy for them to
pretend this is just another business with a luxury dinner. The second
reason for targeting these dinners is finding out who the government
ministers and MPs in attendance are. Last year a list of 40 were present
and exposed by Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT). **[While arms
companies are private sector, \"they can't function without UK
government support]{.underline}**\" says Sarah -- through government
subsidies, civil servants tasked with export sales and the furnishing of
political legitimacy for the trade, that comes with government
endorsement. In 2011, [David Cameron toured the Middle East in order to
'promote democracy']{.underline} by becoming the first foreign leader to
visit Cairo. Cameron even spoke of being 'inspired' by protestors during
the uprisings of the Arab Spring. However, this was overshadowed when it
was revealed that [Cameron was to make several stop-offs in a scheduled
defence tour in undemocratic Gulf States, and that his delegation would
include 8 large British arms manufacturers]{.underline} such as BAE
Systems, in a bid to boost British arms sales. \"It's not wrong to sell
arms,\" he said in response to criticisms. [Since Cameron came to power,
Britain has sold £5.6bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia. Cameron claims:
**We have probably the toughest set of export rules probably anywhere in
the world.** It is obviously difficult to get it right on every
occasion. **Selling the legitimacy of the arms trade to the British
public is a case of binding it to emotive issues**,]{.underline}
explains Sarah: [It's largely based on this false narrative around the
economy and jobs.]{.underline} Just last week we published a new report
laying out how a transition from weapons productions to renewable energy
is really possible and actually wouldn't take that much financial
investment, so factually, [**arguments around jobs and the economy are
not true but they are really emotive issues and they play on people's
fears**,]{.underline} like loss of jobs, [especially when the economic
climate is a bit unstable]{.underline}. So a big part of our role is to
debunk those myths. Many trident and [arms industry workers are 'having
those conversations about what a transition to socially useful
technology would look like.]{.underline} The nature of the UK [Arms
trade is that we do specialise in very technical, complex weapons
systems]{.underline} and the technology is transferable to the systems
that are needed for wind and wave.' [So there's this whole false
narrative around jobs and exports.]{.underline} And if you look at, on
an anecdotal level, graduate recruitment, you go to universities,
engineering or science fairs, and [it's arms companies or oil who have
the best graduate schemes.]{.underline} Or you look at the science fair
and it's sponsored by all the big arms companies and it's all about
selling this 'it's a really exciting industry where you get work with
very cool technology' image. That's the way it tends to play out --
through jobs, economy and us being like the US. CAAT's next target is
Security and Policing -- a three day conference and ExPo held in
Farnborough on March 8-10 -- an event which brings together arms,
security and surveillance companies; \"last year tear gas manufacturers
were there..it's all those who supply the systems needed for borders,
detention, policing and military -- from security cameras, finger
printing machines, to fences, to alarm systems, to hacking, to IT based
infiltration,\" says Sarah. The event is hosted by the ADS industry
trade group, the Home Office and the UKTI DSO -- [the government
department responsible for export arms sales, also tasked with the role
of inviting international delegations.]{.underline} It's not just
something relevant to national policy and national institutions but also
governments like [Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are invited to come and
browse technology and also be trained in police tactics]{.underline} and
systems that we use here. So at the meeting we had two weeks ago we had
Bahrain activists who talked about being tortured and exiled from
Bahrain, arriving in the UK and being put in detention, and then living
here and watching what the government is doing, because Bahrain is
another country that the UK government has a kind of privileged
relationship with. In 2011, Bahrain was subject to a an official
commission of inquiry after protests against the Sunni-led government
gained ground. The report revealed that various forms of illegal torture
were regularly used on dissenters, detainees and prisoners during
interrogation. Bahrain is a close ally of Britain, and following the
report, the relationship was defended under the assurance that the
Bahrain government was working on reforms to police, prisons, judicial
systems and security in line with the recommendations of the Bahrain
independent investigation commission. The UK Foreign Office said UK
policy is \"to support Bahrain in its return to a stable and reformist
state with a good human rights record." In August 2013, Bahrain's King
Hamed visited David Cameron at 10 Downing Street to thank him for his
\"supportive stances\" and also to initiate talks on buying Eurofighter
Typhoon jets. At the end of last year, Human Rights Watch released a
report documenting the same sorts of abuses and torture in interrogation
as found in the 2011 inquiry including beatings, strip downs, cold and
sexual abuse, electric shocks and forced standing. It was also
documented that guards and Bahraini personnel bragged about their
abuses. The report came three weeks after foreign secretary Phillip
Hammond 'inaugurated' a new British naval base near Manama, the capital.
The arms trade intersects at so many different issues; borders, racist
policing, detention, climate change, all-sorts. So a big part of what
we're working towards is to try and build a movement where people can
plug in on the issues that they're working on, and Security and Policing
is a really good moment for that in which it provides a concrete
target... And it's important for us to mobilise in a cross cutting
inter-sectional way. One of those groups is Movement For Justice By Any
Means Necessary who have been leading the growing and powerful
demonstrations to 'Shut Down Yarl's Wood' -- a detention centre run by
private security firm Serco since 2007. There have been a raft of
complaints of violence and sexual abuse meted out on inmates by guards,
forcing an investigation. Firms like Serco will be in attendance at the
Security and Policing Conference. The reason I got into [arms
trade]{.underline} campaigning was because it [represents so clearly
what is wrong with our economic and political system. **It's the epitome
of how messed up capitalism is**]{.underline}...It's definitely a
**[manifestation of bigger problems which draws in a history of
imperialism and plays on people's fears]{.underline}** of the other. [If
you look at the government's response to terrorist attacks in Paris, or
the migrant crisis, the response is militarised policing,]{.underline}
stronger borders, armoured police on the streets but then what you also
see is while all that is happening through the government and through
the media, you've got big exhibitions happening like Security and
Policing in March, [**these big commercial ventures that bring it all
together -- none of this is conducive to more securit**y.]{.underline}
On 3rd February, RAPAR (Refugee and Asylum seeker Participatory Action
Research), a human rights organisation based in Manchester, sent out a
press release with news and photos from the Calais camp. It's not new.
Historically, the [othering of somebody who comes from a different place
is a very tried and tested manoeuvre on the part of people who are
controlling the dominant ideas]{.underline} that are circulating at any
given time in a society. Ironically, the 1905 Aliens act, which was the
first formal legal tool, instrument, that came into existence to control
migration into Britain was actually created specifically to stop Jewish
refugees who were fleeing from Pogroms in the East. It's contested but I
would locate the 1905 Aliens Act as the beginning of border control in
the UK. Despite the perpetuation of these stereotypes for refugees, Dr
Moran points to the [economy within our borders, for the greatest threat
to security]{.underline} -- which continues unimpeded; [**It's the drive
to war which is an inevitable part of the maintenance and perpetuation
of global capital**.]{.underline} The warring brothers, which is the
rich, they fall out. And [in a global marketplace the tendency
of]{.underline} the rate of [profit to fall means]{.underline} a
shrinking marketplace, which means [shrinking profits, **so war is a
very convenient manoeuvre to inflate the potential for profit
again.**]{.underline}

#### The affirmative uses the US restriction of arms sales to maintain the capitalist Empire that only benefits the transnational elites and leads to more US imperialism

**Fernandes 18** (Marcelo Fernandes, Ph.D. - Université Libre de
Bruxelles, Research Areas: Econometrics Empirical Finance, Jan-April
2018, \"Imperialism and the Question of System Stability,\" ScieElo,

[After the collapse of real socialism]{.underline} in Eastern Europe and
the end of the USSR [in the early 1990s]{.underline}, [new questions
were raised about the role of the nation-state, based on the neoliberal
concept of market supremacy]{.underline}. The view that nations were
interdependent and that financial and commercial openness would be
beneficial to all nations was widespread. In the context of Marxism,
some authors began to argue that capitalism had come to be dominated by
large corporations with no remaining ties with their home states.
[Capitalism had reached a degree of organisation that was preventing
conflicts among states]{.underline}. This was argued by Hardt and Negri
(2001) in a widely cited study that, rather curiously, became known as
the 'anti-globalisation manifesto'. [According to the authors,
imperialism no longer existed, and no country was able to play the
leading roles European nations had played in the past]{.underline}
(Hardt and Negri 2001: 14). **[Power was decentralised, and not bound to
particular territories. Instead of imperialism, 'Empire' had emerged,
defined as global power without borders and transcending
nations]{.underline}**.9 A new form of sovereignty had emerged,
comprising national and supranational bodies united by a single logic in
which national states were no longer able to regulate economic and
cultural exchanges. In a context of decaying sovereignty, no state was
able to act as an imperialist nation (Hardt and Negri 2001: 12). In this
way, **[Empire had been born after a transitional period following the
end of World War Two, in a world defined by and organised around three
mechanisms: i) decolonisation, or the gradual and hierarchical recovery
of world markets under the leadership of the USA; ii) the gradual
decentralisation of production; and iii) the development of a system of
international relations that spread the disciplinary productive regime
and the disciplinary society in successive worldwide
evolutions]{.underline}**. These were the three mechanisms that
contributed to the evolution from imperialism to Empire (Hardt and Negri
2001: 266). In Empire, [the new productive forces would not occupy a
definitive place because they would be everywhere, producing not only
commodities 'but also rich and powerful social
relationships']{.underline},10 in a world where national borders would
tend to disappear (Hardt and Negri 2001: 230). Now, transnational
corporations would be responsible for the economic and political
transformations of post-colonial countries and subordinate regions
(Hardt and Negri 2001: 268). [They would also dictate the pace of
production at each moment]{.underline}. As these authors put it, '**[The
state has been defeated, and corporations now rule the
earth]{.underline}**!' (Hardt and Negri 2001: 328). [Imperialist wars
would be replaced by 'just wars', which would actually be a form of
police action, because if borders no longer existed in practice, then
there would be no reason for wars]{.underline}. Rivalries among
countries would be eliminated. Therefore: **[The history of imperialist,
inter-imperialist and anti-imperialist wars is over]{.underline}**. The
end of such history has introduced a kingdom of peace. Or more exactly,
we have entered the era of minor and internal conflicts. [Every imperial
war is a civil war, a police action --]{.underline} from Los Angeles and
Granada to Mogadishu and Sarajevo (Hardt and Negri 2001: 209). [Armies
would wither away]{.underline}. **[The USA would have a world police
force that would not act on behalf of imperialist interests, but for
imperial interest in the name of peace and order]{.underline}** (Hardt
and Negri 2001: 209). The stability of capitalism would reach its
climax. Like Hardt and Negri, Robinson (2005, 2007, 2008) and Harris
(2012) believe that capitalism is being organised by transnational
institutions at the service of transnational capital, in a world where
borders are dissolving. In several works, Robinson emphasises that
[capitalism has undergone great changes since the classical period of
imperialism analysed by Hilferding and Lenin,11 and will find itself in
a new stage known as globalisation, which will be a product of
transnational capital]{.underline}. The dynamics of the contemporary
capitalist system cannot be understood in terms of the nation-state as
the centre. Therefore, [the term globalisation (the latest stage of
capitalism) is consistent with the current moment]{.underline} (Robinson
2002; Harris 2012). Harris (2012: 2) asserts that the fundamental logic
of capitalism, namely to accumulate and exploit labour, will not change.
However, it will adopt new methods for doing so. In turn, Robinson
(2007, 2008) argues that **[the contemporary capitalist system has four
new features: i) the rise of a truly transnational capital and the
integration of all countries into a new global productive and financial
system]{.underline}**, in which national or regional capital still
exist, but transnational capital is dominant; **[ii) the emergence of a
new transnational capitalist class; iii) the rise of transnational state
apparatuses; and iv) the emergence of new relations of power and
inequality in the global society.]{.underline}** However, he argues that
his theory shares little or nothing with Kautsky's thesis of
ultra-imperialism, since the latter assumed that capital would remain
national and unite itself internationally. In Robinson's view, the
conflict between capitals is endemic to the system, but presents itself
in new forms in the era of globalisation, not as wars among states. For
this reason, in the era of globalisation, competition no longer takes
place among nation-states, but only among companies. ['As national
states are captured by transnational capitalist forces, they tend to
serve the interests of global over local accumulation
processes']{.underline} (Robinson 2007: 17). Echoing Hardt and Negri,
Robinson (2007) concludes that [the world is experiencing an 'Empire of
global capital']{.underline}, based in Washington only for historical
reasons. [This Empire no longer serves the interests of a national
bourgeoisie, but of a transnational capitalist class]{.underline}: We
are witness to new forms of global capitalist domination, whereby
intervention is intended to create conditions favourable to the
penetration of transnational capital and the renewed integration of the
intervened region into the global system. [US intervention facilitates a
shift in power from locally and regionally oriented elites to new groups
more favourable to the transnational project]{.underline}. The result of
US military conquest is not the creation of exclusive zones for 'US'
exploitation, as was the result of the Spanish conquest of Latin
America, the British of South Africa and India, the Dutch of Indonesia,
and so forth, in earlier moments of the world capitalist system. [The
enhanced class power of capital brought about by these changes is felt
around the world]{.underline} \[...\]. In sum, **[the US state has
attempted to play a leadership role on behalf of transnational
capitalist interests]{.underline}** (Robinson 2007: 19-20). According to
Robinson (2008: 9), **[the US state is a key instrument for the
reproduction of the global capitalist system, since it acts as a
defender of the interests of big capital, repressing the sectors that
oppose it]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[the growth in US militarisation
after 11/09 has not been related to a quest for hegemony, or the
resurgence of the inter-imperialist rivalries at the end of the 19th
century, but to a contradictory response to the deep crisis of global
capitalism that started in the late 1990s]{.underline}**. In Robinson's
view, the worldwide social polarisation brought about by globalisation
has restricted the ability of the world market to absorb production,
reducing the system's capacity for expansion.12 [The invasion of
Iraq]{.underline}, for example, ha[s created favourable conditions for
the penetration of transactional capital, and helped to integrate the
region into global capitalism]{.underline}. Although this has directly
benefited some US companies (US capital), these firms are in fact
transnational conglomerates with interests that are not tied to US
capital but to global capital (Robinson 2007: 22). Hardt and Negri
(2001), Robinson (2007, 2008), Robinson and Harris (2000) and Harris
(2012) argue that [capitalism had been organised to the point where wars
will no longer be necessary]{.underline}. However, Hardt and Negri were
more emphatic about the role of the state when they argued that, **[in
practice, there would be no armies, but rather a type of transnational
police called upon from time to time to maintain order anywhere in the
world]{.underline}**. Panitch and Gindin (2005, 2012) also argue that
globalisation will not stimulate inter-imperialist rivalries in the
future, but will instead encourage a form of co-operation that will lead
to a period of stability. According to these authors, [to understand
this new stage of imperialism one needs to understand the role of US
imperialism after World War Two]{.underline}. At that moment, stable
conditions for the global accumulation of capital were established by an
'informal Empire,' the American Empire, which was able to integrate
other capitalist powers into a system under its rule. Therefore, [to
understand contemporary imperialism and globalisation, one needs to
theorise about the capitalist state along three dimensions: economic,
political and territorial]{.underline}. In the economic dimension, [the
state is no longer part of the organisation of production, investment,
and the appropriation of surplus, but is still indispensable for
maintaining legal regulation]{.underline}, the administration of
macroeconomic policy, and a 'lender of last resort'. **[Without these
prerogatives of the state, capitalism cannot survive]{.underline}**
(Panitch and Gindin 2005: 102). As regards the political dimension,
following the end of the Cold War, liberal democracy became a model for
all capitalist states. Lastly, [the territorial dimension is implicit in
the first two. Capitalism has evolved by deepening economic ties,
especially within territorial spaces, marked by national borders and
identities]{.underline} (Panitch and Gindin 2005: 103). States remain
subordinated to capital accumulation and capitalist logic, but this does
not eliminate their importance. However, the end of the Cold War
revealed a new hierarchy among the advanced nations. [The separation of
economics and politics in the international sphere facilitated global
integration, and competition no longer had to be expressed in an
imperialist rivalry, as understood by some Marxist theorists in the
early 20th century.]{.underline} Panitch argues that the term
imperialism itself could be obsolete, since inter-imperialist rivalries
no longer exist (Gowan, Panitch and Shaw 2001: 17). That is, [the
informal American Empire has replaced geopolitical
conflicts]{.underline}. According to Panitch and Gindin (2005: 104), [it
is necessary to investigate the separation of economics and politics at
the international level over the past two centuries]{.underline}: This
involves not only an understanding of the progressive marketization and
commodification of social life, but also of the processes by which the
national-territorial capitalist state, in its modal liberal-democratic
form, was universalised and inscribed into the constitution of
international institutions and international law by the mid-20th century
(Panitch and Gindin 2005: 104). [It is the separation between economics
and politics in the international sphere that enables the existence of
informal Empires. This separation was incomplete]{.underline} in the
period of globalisation [between 1870 and 1920]{.underline} (Panitch and
Gindin 2012: 13). [This is why the expansion of
colonialism]{.underline}, [the resistance to adopting liberal democracy,
and the particularism of each state in relation to capital accumulation
generated severe contradictions in the three]{.underline} [dimensions of
the capitalist state]{.underline}, leading, in turn, to
inter-imperialist rivalries. At that point, Marxist theory understood
that the contradictions generated by these factors could not be
resolved. Panitch and Gindin (2005: 106) argue that [the definition of
imperialism as a stage of capitalism avoids the pitfalls of an
a-historical theory of imperialism]{.underline}. However, they criticise
what they describe as 'theoretical fundamentalism', since [if
imperialism is regarded as the last stage of capitalism, no further
changes could take place]{.underline}.13 According to the authors, this
would be wrong: after World War Two, the agreement forged by the USA
subordinated rivalries among the capitalist powers to collaborationism.
**[US democracy brought the credibility of the USA to the rest of the
world, even when its militarism was explicit]{.underline}**. However,
[the other powers have not become passive actors of American
imperialism; they continue to operate with relative autonomy in relation
to the internationalisation of the state, and their actions reflect the
balance of social forces and internal political initiatives in each
state]{.underline}. This allows them to pressure the USA into carrying
out its responsibilities in managing global capitalism in a more
autonomous way of pressures emanating from within the American social
formation itself. But in doing so, [the capitalist powers recognise that
the USA has the capacity to play a leading role in the expansion,
protection and reproduction of capitalism]{.underline} (Panitch and
Gindin 2012: 18). Thus, the country would be more than a mere agent of
the particular interests of American capital, as it also assumes
responsibility for the making and management of global capitalism
(Panitch and Gindin 2005: 112). Hence, **[the European bourgeoisie and
states have no interest in defying US imperialism, as it ultimately
serves the interests of a global capitalist class]{.underline}**.
Panitch and Gindin (2012) recognise that, even with such accumulated
power, the USA has failed to bring the capitalist economy to a new level
of stability. However, [global financial volatility and the ensuing
crises have made the peripheral countries of Asia, Africa and Latin
America more dependent on interventions by the American Empire. Thus,
the success of the USA lies in its ability to create a sphere of
influence that makes the use of military force unnecessary]{.underline}.
So, for these authors, there are no more inter-imperialist rivalries.
Panitch and Gindin present some relevant insights into the international
system and the conduct of the USA as an imperialist power. However,
[they overestimate the capacity of the American state as the organiser
of the system and the driving force of global development, while
neglecting the role of the class struggle in capitalist development
inside each nation-state]{.underline} (Milios and Sotiropoulos 2009:
82). When class struggle is mentioned, it is subordinated to the will of
the dominant state. Consequently, Panitch and Gindin's observations are
closer to a super-imperialism,14 in which one superpower has a degree of
control over other powers.

[Although the sharpest critique of contemporary human rights as nothing
but capitalist system values derives from Marxists]{.underline},
**[Marxists are not the only ones to lay that charge]{.underline}**.
[Kenneth Anderson, former head of Human Rights Watch]{.underline},
[connects the spread of human rights discourse to neo-colonialist
invasion of the Global South by capital from the Global
North]{.underline}: As the global market economy pulverized traditional
societies and moralities and drew every corner of the planet into a
single economic machine, human rights emerged as the secular creed that
the new global middle class needed in order to justify their domination.
(Quoted in Schwab and Polis 2000, 213) He focuses his critique on
arguments such as those of World Bank economist Jean-Pierre Chauffour
who maintains, in an essay entitled "Pro-human Rights Growth Policies,"
**[that human rights are necessary legal frames for a market
economy]{.underline}**. [He sees poverty as a result of various market
failures, notably in markets for credit, insurance, land, and human
capital, that may simply result from state regulations or institutional
imperfections. Instead of expanding the scope of the state to deal with
these imperfections, it would be preferable to deal with them at their
source \[by ending\] any entitlement/income support
programs]{.underline}. (Chauffour 2006, 13) Chauffour simply extends the
logic of the standard interpretation to its economic conclusion:
self-interest is good, the state is a threat to self-interest, so,
wherever possible, minimize the state and maximize market relations.
**[Human rights are amenable to this sort of conflation because they
assume a liberal conception of human beings according to which
individuals are pre-given atomic centres of desire, unencumbered by
definite cultural histories and independent of nature and relations to
other people for their essential interests]{.underline}**. The problem
with this conception is not that it asserts moral equality between
individuals, but that **[it abstracts them from their dependent
relationships to nature and interdependent connections to others within
society.]{.underline}** Natural dependence and social interdependence
are both material conditions of individuals even being alive. [Any
conception of individuality that abstracts from these conditions is thus
incoherent: it cannot account for the existence of the discrete entity
it posits as fundamental.]{.underline} Hence, any conception of rights
that derives from such an incoherent foundation will itself prove
morally and politically incoherent: it will fail to protect that which
they must protect if they are to protect individuals from harm. [On the
environmental front]{.underline}, Laura Westra charges that [the
standard interpretation ignores the "biological integrity" of the
natural world upon which we all depend, justifying irreparable harm to
the biosphere by appeal to the supposed democracy of "consumer
choice]{.underline}" (Westra 2011, 23). Marxist critics ground Westra's
critique of liberal conceptions of the person in the social history of
capitalism. [Capitalism emerged through a process of alienation of the
producers from the means of production]{.underline}. **[Nature is the
ultimate means of production;]{.underline}** the ultimate source of the
material that labour transforms and upon which human life depends.
**[Alienation of labour is at the same time alienation from each other,
in class conflict, patriarchal family relations and cultures, and racist
hierarchies that derive from colonial expansion]{.underline}**. If,
therefore, [h]{.underline}uman [r]{.underline}ights [are regulating
values of global capitalism, and if global capitalism undermines the
material conditions of human dignity, then human rights cannot do the
job they are supposed to do: protect human dignity]{.underline}. These
varying strands of criticism are synthesized in arguably the most
comprehensive Marxist critique of human rights as nothing but system
values, Gary Teeple's The Riddle of Human Rights. Teeple argues that
human rights are "the evolving ethical code of modern capitalism"
(Teeple 2004, 17). As evidence, Teeple points to the way in which civil
and political rights are prioritized in law and in practice over
economic and cultural rights. [Articles 22--27 of the UD, which spell
out social and economic rights, are compromised]{.underline}, according
to Teeple, [by the important qualification that they be satisfied
"relative to the resources of each state]{.underline}." **[Since
existing h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights **[accept the
global political economic structure, as well as the rights of states to
dispose of their resources as they choose, and fail to examine and
critique the class structure of capitalism, this qualification gives any
state that wants to use it a ready-made excuse to not challenge the
accumulation of money-capital in corporate hands as the overriding
economic and social value]{.underline}** (216). Furthermore, the world's
largest economy and watchdog of global capitalism, the United States,
has refused to ratify the Covenant on Social and Economic and Cultural
Rights (ES). By contrast, [the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ation['s Declaration of Civil]{.underline} and Political
Rights ([PC]{.underline}), which [spells out the familiar liberties
associated with classical liberalism, was deemed "immediately
enforceable" upon agreement]{.underline} (18). When egalitarian liberal
and cosmopolitan defenders of the standard interpretation invoke the
satisfaction of human life-requirements as human rights, they
simultaneously invoke, as we saw in section one, the capitalist market
as the default socioeconomic mechanism to attain that goal. If Teeple's
critique is correct, [this decision is selfundermining: the primary
value served by the market is the growth and accumulation of money
capital in private hands]{.underline}. Need satisfaction is at best a
by-product of that drive, and the drive will never be compromised merely
for the sake of satisfying unmet needs, as growing global and national
inequality proves. [Once that drive and the competitive social relations
have become globalized, market forces become properly tyrannical: all
nations must compete for investment, all public policy must be tailored
to attract investment, whether people agree democratically or
not]{.underline}. Democratic decisions will either be re-defined as
whatever choice seems most likely to serve economic growth, or
overridden entirely (as with the case of Greece under Syrizia, where the
overwhelming desire of the citizens to cast off the yoke of austerity
was simply ignored by the European Central Bank).
**[Globalization]{.underline}**, according to Teeple, **[is "the
assertion of the pre-eminence of corporate civil rights over all other
rights]{.underline}**" (Teeple 2004, 8). This assertion of corporate
right pre-eminence imposes social costs on human beings made more
dependent upon market forces by their triumph. [The rights belonging to
the incorporated form of capital constitute the raison d'etre of the
system; and modern liberal democracy protects the rights of corporations
as individual rights in the very constitution of the state, through the
courts, and in the institution of the rule of law]{.underline}. (Teeple
2004, 36--37) **[The individual rights granted corporations at the
national level have become the model for corporate rights at the
international level]{.underline}**. As B.S. Chimni explains, the changes
which have been introduced in international economic law have been
accompanied by an emerging international political law which . . . seeks
to legitimate a system of global apartheid in a bid to preserve
unbelievable privilege for a section of citizens in the advanced
capitalist countries and . . . promote "low-intensity democracies" in
the third world to sustain favourable conditions of foreign investment.
(Chimni 1999, 341) [Since foreign capital has been able to secure
control over increasing proportions of the life supportive resources of
all countries, the political rights that individuals retain are
constrained by the deeper social and economic forces that impose
dependence on labour and commodity markets as socially constructed
conditions of survival. The state is thus either legally stalemated or
forced "to defend corporate rights against . . . subordinate
classes]{.underline}" (Teeple 2004, 39). That human rights include
social, political, and economic rights has not made a practical
difference in the struggle against corporate control over the planet's
life-support systems. Hence, for Teeple, [the standard interpretation of
h]{.underline}uman [r]{.underline}ights [not only fails to act as a
check on the expansion of corporate rights of exclusive control over
universally required resources, they are actually the framework that
legitimates the process]{.underline}. The entire national political
system can find itself hostage to international capital, and the hostage
taking is legal and not contrary to established human rights doctrine or
international law. For example, [**Chapter 11 of**]{.underline} the
North American Free Trade Agreement (**[NAFTA]{.underline}**) "**[gives
a corporation the right to challenge a host of national,
provincial/state and municipal laws and policies. A 'regulatory takings'
clause allows a corporation to sue governments before 'a special
tribunal' . . . not accountable to duly elected
governments]{.underline}**" (Teeple 2004, 43). Freedom for corporate
capital thus comes at the expense of the ability of people to
collectively determine how they will develop and use their resources and
wealth. [The fact that this social structure undermines the natural and
social conditions of the freedom and dignity of human beings cannot be
coherently criticised by the standard interpretation, because, as we
saw, it treats liberal capitalist institutions as
normative.]{.underline} So long as social struggles against injustice
define themselves as struggles to secure human rights, Teeple believes
that those struggles will fail to confront the underlying structure of
power that causes injustice in the first place. [A social formation with
irreconcilable divisions cannot be the final goal of the struggles of
subordinate classes, groups, and peoples. Although civil, political, and
social rights were fought for over many decades . . . the resulting
victories merely completed the formation of modern liberal
democracy.]{.underline} (Teeple 2004, 145) Human rights, therefore, at
least in the standard interpretation, are ultimately the regulating
system values of capitalist globalization. I pose this question: Is the
standard interpretation of human rights the only possible
interpretation, or is there a way of reading the life-valuable content
of human rights against their liberal-capitalist form? I agree with
Marxist and allied critics that **[the standard interpretation of
h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights **[enables their use as
system values that legitimise liberal capitalist
institutions]{.underline}**. At the same time, **[a straightforward
reading of the content of h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights
**[cannot but disclose the repeated assertion of values that are
essential to human life and development, and which are manifestly
threatened by capitalism.]{.underline}** Thus, there is potentially a
different side to human rights. Read from the standpoint of their
content and not their liberal form, they assert life values, anchored in
shared human life-interests, which expose the political, economic, and
moral failings of the dynamics and value system of global capitalism.
The Marxist critique captures the problems of capitalism and the
standard interpretation of human rights that it has generated, but tends
to overlook the critical potential of this counter-reading of human
rights as life-values and hinge principles useful to mobilize and
legitimate struggles against global capitalism.

#### The call to Human Rights produces a neoliberal subject constrained by market ideologies

[The article examined liberalism as a distinct technology of government
and]{.underline} [human rights as an integral part of the ontogenesis of
self-governing subjects]{.underline}. Taking inspiration from Foucault's
discussion of homo oeconomicus, [this]{.underline} article [provided an
internal critique of his cursory dismissal of the affinities between
homo juridicus and neoliberalism]{.underline}. Using Foucault's
analysis, but expanding its purview, the article discussed how [human
rights call homo juridicus into being by detailing four related forms of
liberal ontogenesis]{.underline}. Taken together, they illustrate how it
too acts as a partner, indeed as a predicate, for the liberal technology
of government, thereby recasting the very meaning of freedom and the
possibility of 'agonism'. [While studies acknowledge that human rights
entail numerous transformations in the political and legal landscape,
the article focused on how this occurs through
subjectification]{.underline}, [which is not an 'individual' or
solipsistic activity but has discursive, epistemic, legal and structural
components and effects]{.underline}. **[Human rights assist in the
evolution of a technology of government in line with the principle of
economy and cost--benefit considerations]{.underline}**. In so doing,
**[they belong firmly and fully within the many techniques of neoliberal
rule.]{.underline}** With respect to freedom, in particular, the article
suggested that [the liberal ontogenesis of homo juridicus by human
rights]{.underline} creates and manages the conditions of freedom of
this subject, directing it to take up its freedom within certain paths
of action. At the same time, it also **[limits freedom through its
concretisation of the rule of maximum economy.]{.underline}** Freedom,
therefore, becomes the relationship between the governors and the
governed, where the governed are constituted as free (i.e.
self-governing). Coming into being as capable of, and open to,
self-government, subjects have 'ethical' potential to care for
themselves,133 by taking up their freedom and transforming themselves
within structured fields of action.

#### The US' claims of human rights law is coopted by hegemonic power struggles

The concept of human rights and the international law of human rights
con- stitutes an indispensable tool with which to expose the
inconsistencies, lies, and hypocrisy of an imperial project that
continues to act in conjunction with its other adjunct features in the
form of a capitalist-driven globalization, the networks of transnational
capitalism, the economic model of neoliberalism, and the dynamics of an
ever-expanding global corporate/capitalist order.18 Insofar as [the
American Hegemon has preached the value of human rights as a universal
value that deserves protection and enforcement**, it is time to
juxtapose these pronouncements with its actual policies**]{.underline}.
In general terms, it can be established that "[hegemonic powers
throughout history have sought to set the rules, not necessarily to
abide by them. They have attempted to create the institutions and
enforce the rules that govern the global political economy and that
regulate relations among states and peoples]{.underline}. This means
that they generally act differently from the rest of the world. For
example, hegemonic powers typically protect their citizens from the
judicial proceed- ings of other powers."19 When the United States
exempted itself from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), it offered the excuse that it may result in "frivolous"
proceedings against U.S. soldiers or policy makers who may find
themselves charged with war crimes. Despite the fact that most nations
have endorsed The Rome Statute that created the ICC, the American
Hegemon has placed itself outside of its legal jurisdiction. In much the
same manner, U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and special legal
counsel to the U.S. Department of Justice, Professor John Yoo, both
called the Geneva Conventions "quaint" and therefore not binding on the
Imperialism, Empire, Global Capitalism 37 Bush administration's use of
torture on captured "enemy combatants" in its prosecution of the "war on
terror." According to Richard Falk, this history demonstrates "it is
clear that this American hostility to the ICC is not a matter of
principled opposition to international criminal law based on the primacy
of sovereign rights\...This manner of conduct can be understood either
as 'empire's law' or as simple hypocrisy."20 A similar conclusion has
been offered by Professor Michael Mann about the burden of hegemony on
the hegemon to follow established international law principles: "We must
remain skeptical of American claims that the New Empire would be
completely benevolent. Imperialists always say this but never are. But
[an Empire to which the ruled routinely consent is not unusual. This is
what we call 'hegemony]{.underline},[' a word which indicates that the
imperial power establishes 'the rules of the game' by which others
routinely play]{.underline}\...Hegemony should be an invisible hand,
lying behind the accepted rules of the game. The catch is that to be
hegemonic, the U.S. might have to play by the rules. An Empire based on
highly visible militarism abandons the rules and so risks losing
hegemony."21 By virtue of its fear of losing hegemony, "the United
States preaches uni- versalism, but it practices national particularity
and cultural relativism."22 Therefore, "because of American
exceptionalism, a view deeply embedded in American culture, the United
States has manifested persistent difficulty in adjusting to almost all
contemporary multilateral arrangements it does not control or heavily
influence."23 The myth of American exceptionalism has worked to define
the character, nature, and practice of American multilat- eralism. In
this respect, American contempt for, and opposition to, joining the
International Criminal Court (ICC) is connected to its contempt for the
potential of the United Nations to circumscribe, challenge, or place
limits on the exercise of American power. In reality, there was no
contradiction between the establishment of interna- tional institutions
like the IMF, World Bank, NATO and SEATO, the GATT (and its successor,
the WTO), and the bold assertion of U.S. hegemony. The paradox is
overcome with the realization that American priorities and influ- ence
would have the last word on what these post-1945 institutions would seek
to accomplish (or prevent from being accomplished) on the world stage.
With this realization, the true character of American multilateralism
becomes clear through the prism of America's hegemonic predominance.
[Whatever gloss that certain academics and U.S. policy makers would wish
to bestow on NATO, SEATO, the IMF, the World Bank, GATT (and later, the
WTO), the fact remains that these international institutions undertook
the task of creating a global regulatory framework that excluded the
global South from having a definitive voice or a vote on matters of
trade and finance]{.underline}. Hence, "the point to be stressed here is
that this form of multilateralism reflected few constraints on U.S.
independence."24 When viewed from this perspec- tive, we begin to
realize that **[a truly effective international law has not yet been
created, for if an effective and democratic form of international law
did exist, it would be one that protected the weak and the
strong]{.underline}**---and would 38 The Future of Global Relations
embody a form and practice of international law principles and
mechanisms that would constrain the exercise of U.S. power.25 Instead,
we have in its place the de facto global dominance of an American
Hegemon that "gener- ally opposes the creation of international law and
organization that might seriously restrain the independent or unilateral
exercise of US power."26 The lack of a viable legal and rule-making
capacity to effectively oppose or to even constrain the American Hegemon
reveals the fact [that there has been an underlying pattern of hegemony
and domination that has held sway through- out the international
system]{.underline} from 1945 to the present. Acknowledging these
patterns is critical to both understanding the com- plex relationship
between the regional and global aspects of governance. On the one hand,
regional actors have resented being forced to conform to a set of rules
and regulations established by the American Hegemon and its global
institutional network of financial forces. Yet, on the other hand,
regional actors have also lived in fear of being excluded or completely
left out of that hegemonic system. In light of this dialectic, the
nations of the global South have been forced to live with a persistent
conceptual and political duality. The regions of the global South have
been caught between the two poles of America's hegemonic
power---marginalization, on the one hand, and domi- nation, on the
other. [In striving to meet their developmental requirements the nations
of the global South **have been forced to participate in U.S.-dominated
trading and financial structures and rules**]{.underline}. [To ignore
this reality is to risk a path of marginalization that could lead to
ruin]{.underline}. However, the other side of the coin is that
participation carries with it the dangers associated with vulnerability,
the surrender of sovereignty, and the loss of bargaining power. Under
these conditions, the choice between domination and marginalization is
not much of a choice. To awaken to this reality is to come to observe
that "contrary to a rigorous or expansive understanding of hegemonic
stability theory, great powers do not make great multilateralists."27
What hegemonic stability theory actually stands for is the proposition
that, up until this most recent historical moment, the American Hegemon
has effectively been able to either control or manage global relations
largely unimpeded. Given these facts, [it is clear that the exercise of
global power by the Ameri- can Hegemon follows a double standard with
regard to human rights]{.underline}. On the one hand, [**the hegemon
preaches respect for human rights at home and abroad while often
violating this standard in practice**. U.S. corporations, the World
Bank, the IMF, and the WTO have often intruded on the sovereignty and
rights of nations throughout the global South.]{.underline} Hence, I
will argue that **[the enterprise of America's hegemony has made the
central tenets and prac- tice of human rights law incompatible with the
universal claims of human rights]{.underline}**. Further, I will argue
that the pursuit of America's global hegemony has led to a situation in
which the United States has engaged in "state ter- rorism" vis-à-vis the
criminal nature of America's military tactics.28 The U.S. reliance on
the ethic of power, in isolation from the power of ethics, creates not
only a crisis for human rights per se; it has also created a crisis the
entire construct of international law. Nowhere is this more evident than
with respect Imperialism, Empire, Global Capitalism 39 to the notion and
concept of sovereign equality. Under the auspices of the American
Hegemon, we find that "the predominant position of the United States
puts sovereign equality under significant pressure\...it affects not
only the traditional, formal elements of the legal concept of sovereign
quality, but also keeps the United States outside the universal legal
order created in recent decades, either through U.S. insistence on
exceptional treatment, or through its abstention from treaties that
otherwise find almost universal sup- port---wherever possible[, the
United States seeks to evade international law's pull toward
equality]{.underline}."29 The tragedy of the American hegemonic project
is that through its mili- tary and economic interventions, the sovereign
rights of independent states and the peoples within their boundaries
have become enslaved to the dic- tates of the American Empire and its
priorities, often to the detriment of their own interests, development,
and rights. Yet, America's global lawless- ness during the Bush-II years
has continued unabated. On this matter, let us just take a small

and World Order: Structural, Institutional and Normative Challenges,34
(6) Strategies of Dominance: The Misdirection of US Foreign Policy,35
and (7) The Constitution's Text in Foreign Affairs.36 What these texts
have in common is a deep concern with how U.S. strategists during the
Bush-II presidency have combined their ideological vision with America's
economic expansionism and their attempt to guide America's hegemonic
role in the international system. Historically, it represents an
American for- eign policy approach that began with Woodrow Wilson. It
has often held out the promise of peace for the United States. This
peace, however, has turned out to be a peace of illusions. It did not
make the world "safe for democracy" and, [in the first decade of the
twenty-first century, it has produced neither peace nor security for the
United States or the world at large.]{.underline} My purpose for citing
the above-referenced select bibliography in the body of this chapter is
to underscore the presence of a widespread recogni- tion of some of the
central problems associated with the exercise hegemony. While the
historical roots of this problem may be traced back to the early years
of the twentieth century, there is little question but that the
presidency of George W. Bush has taken American lawlessness to a whole
new level. Having started down this path, we are left to wonder how many
successive U.S. administrations will continue down this same path or, in
the alternative, will have difficulty in reversing the direction.

#### Human rights rhetoric is used to justify military intervention in the third world -- props up capital by opening new markets.

Throughout this book, I have referred to the [**U.S. primacy
coalition**. It is made up of **national security state bureaucrats**,
**political leaders**, and **members of the military-industrial
complex**]{.underline}. [Yet, it **also includes intellectuals**,
**professors**, and **journalists** who have been **unapologetically
committed** to the **idea of** U.S. **heg**emony, of endless United
States primacy, and the illusion of America's capacity to exercise
global domination.]{.underline} The advocates of the American hegemonic
doctrine may be placed into three categories: (1)
[**neocons**ervatives]{.underline}, (2) **[democratic
hegemonists]{.underline}**, and (3) **[liberal
imperialists]{.underline}**. The neoconservative advocates, such as
Michael Ledeen, Francis Fukuyama, Norman Podhoretz, and Charles
Krauthammer all share the same positions: [an **undying** adherence to
unipolarity, the **endless drive for U.S. hegemony**, the need to ignore
international law, their **rejection of multilat**eralism, and their
contempt for the UN.]{.underline} Many of them participated in authoring
the infamous Project for the New American Century (PNAC). The democratic
hegemonists count among there advocates Ivo Daalder, James Lindsay,
Anne-Marie Slaughter, and John Ikenberry. Their arguments [overlap with
those of the liberal imperialists who **want to replace sovereignty with
human rights** because both groups **endorse** the **invasion of
sovereign states**. The try to justify this position by arguing that the
United States and its allies have a duty to invade, occupy, and govern
failed states. So, they endorse a **doctrine of preemption** and **hide
behind** the fig leaf of **humanitarian intervention**.]{.underline}
This is what is shared in common [between the democratic hegemonists and
the liberal imperialists]{.underline}, whose advocates include Niall
Ferguson, Michael Ignatieff, Peter Beinhart, and Paul Berman. What all
three groups have in common are [shared values that favor U.S. primacy
and hegemony, a **concern with power and not peace**]{.underline}.
Finally, [they **all invoke** the **protection of human rights** as a
pretext **to achieve** strategic or **commercial goals**.]{.underline}25
These are the [exceptions they wish to see written into international
law.]{.underline} Falk's response to this claim is prescient when he
notes, "so long as the power of exception is a matter of decision by
hegemonic government, the limitations associated with the constraining
guidelines are not likely to inhibit discretionary wars."26 It is for
this reason that I have proposed the Principle of Hegemonic State
Accountability (PHSA) and argue for its indefinite use into the future
of global relations. Hence, my proposed PHSA is designed to [**expose**
the **hypocrisy** of those members of the U.S. primacy coalition who
seek to use the notion of **humanitarian intervention** and **human
rights** as a **fig leaf** for **continued** U.S.
**heg**emony]{.underline}--- as exemplified in [the call for
**interventionism**, **preemptive wars**, and an **aggressive foreign
policy**]{.underline} that was condemned at Nuremberg and prohibited by
the principles enumerated in the Nuremberg Charter. Further, the UN
Charter provides for a principled and effective path of accountability
for all nations vis-à-vis the UN Security Council. While the Security
Council stands in need of some basic reforms---such as the fact that the
composition of the council should be changed to reflect current
realities and that the veto power enjoyed by the Security Councils
Permanent Five Members could be eliminated--- I would argue that it is
still a better place to oversee this transitional period historical
period of the crumbling walls of the American Hegemon. However, foreign
policy heavyweights on both the Left and Right are now calling for a new
"League of Democracies." One day, they say, it could replace the UN. But
such a plan rests on the false assumption that democracies inherently
work well together---or that anyone else besides the United States
thinks it is a good idea. As Thomas Carothers notes, "[by **proposing**
yet **another U.S.-led**, **democracy** focused global initiative
reflects an almost willful obliviousness to how such an idea would be
perceived and received outside the United States]{.underline}."27 Such
an idea is just [**another extension** of the **imperial mind-set** that
has dominated the U.S. primacy coalition]{.underline} in order to
[**continue** the **pursuit of heg**emony]{.underline} even as it
crumbles around them. At the other extreme, there is Richard Haas,
President of the Council on Foreign Relations. In addressing the
question of what will follow U.S. dominance, he argues that "the
principal characteristic of 21st century international relations is
turning out to be non-polarity: a world dominated not by one or two or
even several states but rather by dozens of actors possessing and
exercising various kinds of power."28 In this regard, he lumps together
not only the six major world powers but also a good many international
organizations and NGOs. This is an approach that stands in stark
contrast to my depiction of a multipolar or multicentric world of
regional orders that are coming into being under the ideological rubric
of regionalism and being birthed into existence by the practices and
processes associated with the growing phenomenon of "regionalization."
So, where Haas finds an emerging era of "nonpolarity," I have
articulated the evolution of a multicentric world of regions that will
replace and surpass the drive for U.S. hegemony by building what I call
a "Posthegemonic Era." Where Haas describes the development of
"non-polar disorder" and argues that "the increasing non-polar world
will have mostly negative consequences for the U.S.---and for much of
the rest of the world as well,"29 I argue the opposite. I argue that a
[**multicentric** world of regional orders will be premised on
**greater** levels of **cooperation** and, at the same time, will
**effectively accommodate** a **postimperial America** into its scheme
and ordering]{.underline}. There are many historical trends that are
leading both the United States and regional organizations in a
multicentric world of regional orders into a Posthegemonic Era. Among
these trends are [the **rejection of** the **neoliberal economic model**
and the political agenda of neoconservatives. This rejection has led to
the **growth of regional** alliances **and international alliances**.
China and India are emerging as the great powers]{.underline} of the
twenty-first century.30 [Latin America is a regional center for
international investment]{.underline}.31 [The European Union is a
regional model for the rest of the world]{.underline}.32 [Rising levels
of prosperity in Asia are accompanied by a rejection of U.S.
interventionism]{.underline}.33 [The growth rate of emerging economies
has surged to around 7 percent.]{.underline} Emerging economies have
large foreign exchange reserves---not less than three-quarters of the
global total. During the Bush-II years, [China and India added more to
global GDP than America. In fact, **America's importance** as an
**engine of global growth** has been **exaggerated**.]{.underline} Since
2000, its share of world imports has dropped from 19 percent to 14
percent. America's current account deficit has started to shrink,
meaning that it is no longer pulling the rest of the world along. Since
2006, throughout the Global South, moves have been made to tighten
existing investment rules to regulate foreign investments and protect
"strategic sectors" from foreign investors. Unlike the 1990s, today the
costs and benefits of foreign direct investment (FDI) are being
evaluated in a more balanced manner that includes social, political, and
strategic factors---not just economic ones.34 Further evidence of an
emerging Posthegemonic Era is found in the reality that the EU can
shoulder greater defense burdens, even as China and India emerge as
great powers. [Regional organizations fill the power gap as **U.S.
heg**]{.underline}emony [**declines** and its primacy comes to a close.
The era of U.S. domination is ending as the Asian Century is beginning
to emerge]{.underline}.35 The growing strength of regional organizations
is creating a world order of enhanced mutual cooperation for common
purposes. For example, China, the United States, and the Middle East
have a triangular relationship so that if any one of the three sides of
this triangular relationship is unhappy, it has the power to make the
other two unhappy as well.36 In [this new geopolitical environment,
diplomacy and dialogue must of necessity begin the task of replacing
unilateralism]{.underline}. 37 Consensual governance among regional and
international actors in alliance structures that increase trade and
investment for the sake of genuine national and regional development are
the pragmatic antidotes to neoconservative and neoliberal economic
models.38 Latin American nations are rejecting U.S.-backed Free Trade
Agreements (FTAs) more frequently.39 [The U.S. will continue to push for
FTAs but will face growing opposition because of their negative impact
in **effectuating higher levels of domestic inequality** across all of
Latin America.]{.underline} The Andean countries (Ecuador and Peru) will
be forced to democratize their respective participatory frameworks for
decision making. In turn, the United States will be forced to
accommodate radical changes to FTAs that have left millions of citizens
out of the participatory framework. As Professor Timothy Canova has
observed on the effects of the U.S.-dominated system of global finance
in general: "the global monetary system, and the IMF in particular,
systematically subordinates entire nations of color. Such systematic
subordination generates literally millions of unheard stories of
oppression, but these stories are often marginalized, ignored, or
pathologized by the way that dominant discourse blames the victim."40
Appropriately, Canova recognizes that "the IMF's structural adjustment
punishment should be seen as a direct threat to Latin America's cultural
values. The IMF's one-size-fits-all solution of downward adjustment has
a leveling effect on local political cultures and social progress."41 To
counter these debilitating policies associated with the project of U.S.
hegemony, Latin America embraces Mercosur and the Andean Community free
trade organizations, which can easily promote greater regional
integration. Guaranteeing fairness and inclusiveness to sectors of the
populace not favored by past FTAs shows that these regions have learned
that equitable development and democratization must accompany all
approaches to economic liberalization. It is in both U.S. and Latin
American interests to promote poverty reduction and long-term stability
through greater inclusiveness of previously excluded sectors.
Additionally, the Bank of the South (Banco del Sur) is becoming the
primary development bank for South America. It is designed to advance
regional integration in the spirit of the more regional-centric
Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). Due to these advances,
the IMF and World Bank will continue diminish in importance throughout
Latin America and the rest of the Global South. This trend is already
evident in Southeast Asia thanks to the vision of an ASEAN Economic
Community. The ten-member Association of South East Asian Nations
(ASEAN) has brought forward the planned deadline for the establishment
of an ASEAN Economic Community from its original date of 2020 to 2015.42
In light of these trends it seems certain that the crumbling walls of
American hegemony will be forced to accommodate a rising multicentric
world of regional orders. Yet, given the historical record, I am
compelled to conclude that the [**U.S. Empire** will **not go quietly**
into the night of its imperial sunset. Rather, its political and
military **elites still seem dedicated** to their conception of American
primacy and its continuation into the twenty-first century. Associated
with them is a class of **transnational capitalist elites** composed of
**banking, corporate, and financial interests** that want to continue
their global reign under the military auspices of the U.S.
Empire.]{.underline} To both sets of elites, I would offer the following
warning, taken from the writing of Petras and Veltmeyer: "Empire
building is the result of deliberate, calculated acts and improvised
interventions in circumstances and contingencies, which are out of the
control of imperial elites. [**Imperial policymakers** utilize a **vast
array of policy tools** in **destroying adversaries** and **supporting
clients**, **but** they **neither control all political resources** nor
dominate the conditions or social forces which act against
them]{.underline}."43 To this observation we may also [note that the
2008 domestic economy of the United States has been placed in the throes
of a serious meltdown, largely due to years of unrestrained financial
deregulation.]{.underline} The U.S. citizenry and its elites are in the
process of being forced to confront the following reality: "[Even those
who favor the prevailing **free-market dogma** may well **remember**
that a **democracy that lacks effective and informed public debate**
during times of crisis is no longer master of its own fate, but an
organism at the mercy of outside forces]{.underline}."44 [For the future
of American hegemony, it appears that these lessons are being learned
too late.]{.underline}

#### The affirmative creates their arms reduction as a humanitarian exhibit that is inherently neoliberal 

**Pauliny 16** (Tara Pauliny, Assistant Professor John Jay college of
criminal justice, 2016, Neoliberal Rhetorics and Body Politics:
Plastinate Exhibits as Infiltration, Lexington books, pg. 25-27)///PSC

[Neoliberal Rhetorics and Body Politics filters transnational feminist
rhetorical analyses through the lenses of necropolitical, biopolitical,
and affect theories to understand how the global force of neoliberalism
infiltrates all parts of life from nation-state relationships to
individual subject formation.]{.underline} Through rhetorical analyses
of plastinate exhibits' political and cultural contexts, their marketing
literature and showcased artifacts, and their connection to historical
displays of bodies, the project articulates how neoliberalism creates a
grand narrative while simultaneously permeating daily living. [Focusing
on the hugely popular and profitable exhibits of preserved, dissected,
and posed human bodies and body parts offered by the German anatomist
Gunther von Hagens and Premier Exhibitions, the book sees these exhibits
as both examples of neoliberalism's ideological reach and as a critical
lens through which to understand the scope of that reach]{.underline}.
In The Megarhetorics of Global Development, Dingo and Scott call for the
mobilization of rhetoric's "interpretive and productive toolbox \[. .
.\] to highlight, critique, and intervene in the hegemonic functions of
neoliberal global development" ("Introduction" 16). This book follows
their logic and, as such, is guided by the following questions: How do
these exhibits illustrate neoliberalism's rhetorical force and cultural
infiltration?; Within these contexts, how does neoliberalism contribute
to the historical, public, profitable, and pedagogical display of human
cadavers?; How do these exhibits showcase neoliberalism's impact on the
transnational relationships of states---especially the United States and
China?; How do the ideas forwarded in these exhibits showcase
neoliberalism's emphasis on health and well-being both within and
outside the United States; How do the exhibits showcase the
corporatization and privatization of health and the connections being
made here among health, national interest, personal responsibility, and
profit?; and finally, How do these exhibits illustrate neoliberalism's
impact on subjectivity and how might subjects intervene in this process?
The first chapter, "Plastination and a History of Bodily Display,"
begins to investigate the world of plastinated corpses by looking back
toward its conception[. Illustrating how the very process of
plastination serves as a metaphor for neoliberalism's rhetorical
infiltration and explaining why these exhibits serve as particularly
fruitful analytical sites, I review the history, purpose, and relevant
particulars of BODY WORLDS and BODIES...The Exhibition]{.underline}. The
chapter then [reveals the exhibits' connection to historical bodily
displays such as freak shows, public autopsies, and human museum
curiosities, and closes by positing why these exhibits might best be
understood as a postmodern expansion of colonialist
eugenics]{.underline}. The next chapter, "Neoliberal Necropolitics:
Rhetorics of the Living Dead," evidences [neoliberalism's turn toward
the "commodification of everything]{.underline}," while also revealing
its hidden costs. It documents a transnational system that
discriminately values life: one that recognizes some humans (the
exhibits' customers) as inherently worthwhile, while measuring others
(the population it exploits) by the labor that can be extracted from
their corpses. And**[, by identifying and connecting the international
trade agreements, policies, and commodity classifications that work in
support of these exhibits, it demonstrates how the regime of
neoliberalism subjugates human rights, political ideology, and even
nationalism to the pursuit of economic gains.]{.underline}** Ultimately,
[the chapter examines the necropolitical force of these exhibits and
their place within the wider transnational arena where organ harvesting,
surrogacy, and blood procurement is constructed as a neoliberal
right]{.underline}. Chapter three, "For-Profit Pedagogies: Neoliberalism
and the Plastinate Marketplace," examines how BODIES...The Exhibition
and BODY WORLDS offer particular examples of how neoliberal discourses
of self-reliance and self-control get translated and bought---both
literally and figuratively---by Western consumers. [It analyzes what I
call the exhibits' "rhetorics of validity and value," their "rhetorics
of self-reliance and control," and finally, their "rhetorics of
souvenirs]{.underline}." By illustrating how the exhibits' discourse and
objects for purchase allow neoliberalism to be materialized, [the
chapter elucidates how the design and marketing of the exhibits, and
their related paraphernalia, moves the discourse of neoliberalism from
the public view and into private spaces]{.underline}. It extrapolates
from these aspects and maps their rhetorical functions---that is, it
delineates and analyzes the arguments about neoliberalism that are being
advanced by these exhibits. In the final chapter, "Rhetorics of Affect
and Intimacy: Plastinate Exhibits and the Construction of the Neoliberal
Citizen-Subject[," I argue that the plastinate exhibits' persuasive
effects are predicated, in part, on the rhetorical deployment of
intimacy and affect]{.underline}. The chapter posits that the [exhibits
foster a relationship among audience, text, and author that is built on
the possibility of personal transformation and material effect, where
viewers are constructed as recipients of authorial]{.underline} (albeit
anonymous and disembodied) [knowledge and benevolence]{.underline}.
Drawing on the Foucauldian concepts of biopower and governmentality, the
chapter focuses on this intimate and affective rhetorical relationship
and asks how such appeals construct a particular version of the
neoliberal citizen-subject. In doing so, [the chapter also remains
attuned to the exhibits' continued employment of the neoliberal
rhetorics of freedom, personal responsibility, self-reliance, and choice
as it illustrates how these discourses have come to penetrate the very
notion of the self.]{.underline} Ultimately, [Neoliberal Rhetorics and
Body Politics locates the necropolitical, biopolitical, and affective
aspects of discourse as it investigates the rhetorical palimpsest
created when neoliberal ideology is filtered through public
pseudo-pedagogical exhibits. It demonstrates how persuasive, insidious,
and pervasive a seemingly innocuous exhibit can be---especially when it
engages and exploits such mainstream and commonplace associations as the
Boy and Girls Scout of America and heavily weighted markers of
individualism.]{.underline}

### L -- Regulation 

#### Arms-Industry profitability is built into the very fabric of government regulations of arms. Arms corporations directly influence policies, help determine where to wage wars, and continue uneeded production in the name of profit.

**Kirk and Okazawa-Rey 2000** Gwyn Kirk and Margo Okazawa-Rey,
"Neoliberalism, Militarism, and Armed Conflict", Social Justice, Vol.
27, No. 4 (82), Neoliberalism, Militarism, And Armed Conflict ( Winter
2000), pp. 1-17, <http://www.jstor.org/stable/29768029>, /MegLak

The [articles]{.underline} in Part 1 [focus on connection among
nation-states, militaries, and corporations]{.underline}. Staples uses
[the term "**corporate-military complex,"**]{.underline} as more
accurate for contemporary times. In the early draft of speech on leaving
office in 1961, Eisenhower used the phrase
"military-industrial-congressional" complex but dropped the reference to
Congress in the public version (Nelson, 2000:6). Lockheed Martin, the
largest weapons maker in the world, [provides current examples of these
connections]{.underline}. The company received over \$18 billion in U.S.
government contracts in 1999, \$12.6 billion from the Pentagon and over
\$2 billion from the Department of Energy for nuclear-weapons activities
(Fischer, Sredanovic, and Massen 2000). When Lockheed merged with Martin
Marietta in 1995, U.S. taxpayers payed \$1.2 billion for merge related
costs such as employee relocation and plant closures. [Lockheed Martin
has given over \$1.6 billion in]{.underline} Political Action Committee
[(PAC) contributions since 1997, plus another \$500 thousand in soft
money to Democratic and Republican Party committees]{.underline}; is
also spent \$10.2 million lobbying in 1997 and 1998. Key [Lockheed
Martin company associates are involved at top levels of the Republican
and Democratic presidential campaigns and in foreign-policy decision
making.]{.underline} Many commentators have noted the weakening of the
nation-state as a corollary of increased corporate power. Despite some
significant changes, we argue that [**nation-states continue to fulfill
their major function: maintaining conditions for capital accumulation**.
Financing the military and, where necessary, generating strong
ideological support for it,]{.underline} whether by invoking patriotism,
ethnocentrism, or national security, is a crucial state role.

**[The military is both a state agency and a highly profitable sector
within industrialized economies due to weapons manufacturing and the
international trade in arms]{.underline}**. Governments of countries
with arms industries pay for weapons production twice over. Public funds
underwrite the often decades-long development process for complex
weapons systems, and governments are the sole customers for the. Steven
Staples argues that [the large U.S. military budget "is for all
practical purposes a corporate subsidy" siphoning public money into
private hands]{.underline}, and protected under Article XXI of the
general Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), [which allows
"governments free reign for actions taken for national security
interests."]{.underline} Staples argues that with global economic
integration the "weakened state no longer has the ability to reign in
weapons corporations, and is trapped increasingly by corporate
interests: greater military spending, state subsidies, and a
liberalization of the arms trade."

Tamar Gabelnick and Anna Rich take up the issue of the arms trade in the
fifth article. They emphasize potential contradictions between security
policy and international arms sales, nothing that ["U.S. arms export
policy was established to protect national security, but has become
increasingly focused on commercial interests]{.underline}" such that
"proposed export reforms will lead to further loss of control over
conventional arms proliferation." And [outcome of international sales is
that militaries can find themselves up against enemies armed with
weapons provided by their own governments if political and military
alliances shift.]{.underline} This happened to Britain in the
Falklands/Malvinas war and to the United States in the Persian Gulf War.
In an attempt to reduce arms sales, U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney
has proposed a Code of Conduct that would restrict the sale of arms to
countries that are \"nondemocratic, aggressors, human rights abusers, or
not open about their military spending.\" This is a step in the right
direction, but as Gabelnick and Rich suggest, it will need to be applied
consistently to have much impact. The definitions of nondemocratic,
aggression, or human rights abuse are open to interpretation. Russia\'s
assurance, for example, \"that it will not sell offensive weapons to
Iran despite \[its\]decision...to resume arms sales to Teheran\"
(Reuters, December 7, 2000: A16) suggests a clear-cut distinction
between offensive and defensive weapons that may be meaningless in
practice.

[Many countries are involved in arms trading]{.underline}. Most people
are killed by small arms that are cheap and easily available worldwide,
rather than by highly sophisticated weaponry. A good deal of the
cross-border trade in small arms is illegal but highly profitable for
manufacturers, dealers, brokers, shippers, and financiers (Lumpe, 2000).
[This trade is an important way for poorer countries to earn hard
currency to repay foreign debt. Staples notes that "foreign embassies
and trade missions abroad are used to aid arms sales]{.underline}," a
point reiterated by Karen Talbot, who [argues that "bombing and missile
strikes, are, more than ever, giant bazaars for selling wares of the
armaments manufacturers.]{.underline}" The Persian Gulf War and the
bombing of Kosovo allowed stocks to be displayed, tested, and reduced
somewhat. William Greider (1998) argues [**that there is no technical
reason to update U.S. weapons -- the most sophisticated in the world --
except for the need for continued profit**s.]{.underline} He notes that
the biggest enemy of the future U.S. weapons production is the copious
supply of weapons already in existence; **[hence, the need to use them
so as to justify continued production.]{.underline}**

#### Industrial management of the Department of Defense is a form of neoliberal control over American military power and is used to expand imperialism using economic and military influence.

**Melman 97** Seymour Melman, "From Private to State Capitalism: How the
Permanent War Economy Transformed the Institutions of American
Capitalism", *Journal of Economic Issues*, 1997, 31:2, 311-332, DOI:
10.1080/00213624.1997.11505920, /MegLak

This new institution of [state-managerial control has been]{.underline}
the result of actions [undertaken for]{.underline} the declared purpose
of **[adding to military power and economic efficiency and of
reinforcing]{.underline}** civilian, rather than professional,
[**military rule**.]{.underline} Its main characteristics are
institutionally specific and therefore substantially independent of its
chief of the moment. The effects of its operations are independent of
the intention of its architects and may even have been unforeseen by
them.

[The creation of state-management marked the transformation
of]{.underline} President Dwight Eisenhower\'s [\"military-industrial
complex]{.underline},\" a loose collaboration [formed]{.underline}
mainly [through market relations, of senior military officers,
industrial managers, and legislators]{.underline}. Robert McNamara,
under the direction of President John Kennedy, organized a formal
central-management office to administer the military-industrial empire.
In place of the M-I complex, [there is now a defined
managerial-hierarchical control center that regulates tens of thousands
of subordinate managers.]{.underline}

The state management has also become the most powerful decision-making
unit in the U.S. government. Thereby, [the federal government does
not]{.underline} \"serve\" business or \"[regulate\"
business]{.underline}, since the [new management is the largest of them
all. **Government is business**]{.underline}. That is state capitalism.

[The]{.underline} normal [operation]{.underline}, including expansion,
[of]{.underline} the new [state-management has been based upon the
pre-emption of a lion\'s share of federal tax revenue and of the
nation\'s finite supply of technical manpower]{.underline}. [This use of
capital]{.underline} and skill [has produced growth of parasitic
economic activity-products that]{.underline} are not part of the level
of living and that [cannot be used for further production; they often
have dubious military value as well.]{.underline}

By the 1960s, [sustained concentration of technical manpower and capital
on military technology and in military industry has caused visible
industrial-technological depletion]{.underline} (even as the GNP
increased). For example: 1. By 1968, U.S. industry operated the world\'s
oldest stock of metal-working machinery; 64 percent was 10 years old or
more. 2. No U.S. railroad has anything in motion that compares with the
Japanese and French fast trains. 3. By 1966, the U.S. merchant fleet
ranked 23rd in age of vessels. In 1966, world average of vessels was 17
years, United States 21, Japan 9. 4. While the United States uses the
largest number of research scientists and engineers in the world, key
U.S. industries, such as steel and ma- chine tools, are in trouble in
domestic markets; by 1967, for the first time, the United States
imported more machine tools than it exported. 1

**[As civilian industrial technology deteriorates or fails to advance,
productive employment opportunities for Americans
diminish.]{.underline}** (Reports on decline in U.S. manufacturing
industries during the Cold War appear in my books that are cited here.
Impacts on employment-number of jobs lost and associated import
dependence-are cited in Melman \[1996\].)

[All of this only begins to reckon the true cost to America of operating
the state military machine]{.underline}. Clearly, no mere ideology or
desire for individual power can ac- count for the colossal costs of the
military machine. A lust for power has been at work here, but it is not
explicable in terms of an individual\'s drive for power. Rather, the
state-management represents an institutionalized power lust. [A normal
thirst for more managerial power within the largest management in the
United States **gives the new state-management an unprecedented ability
and opportunity for building a military-industry empire at home
and**]{.underline} for [using this as an **instrument for building
empire abroad**.]{.underline} This is a new imperialism.

The operating rules of the older imperialism invited the use of armed
force to as- sure control over important investments or trade (actual or
potential). Virtually none of this could be found in Vietnam.
Nevertheless, \". . . In the eyes of the managers of America\'s state
capitalism, Vietnam was the great testing ground for direct application
of the new tools available to them. The [methods of]{.underline} the
[new imperialism included direct wielding of military, political and
economic power to]{.underline} checkmate leftist nationalism and to take
[direct political control of entire nations-**without relying
on**]{.underline}, and even in the absence of, **[economic mechanisms of
trade and investment that were basic to the older
imperialism]{.underline}**.\" Accordingly, \". . . The expenditure of
over \$150 billion of U.S. government funds and the operations of a
major war that took more than fifty thousand American lives and an
immense toll in Indochinese lives and property is best explained in
terms of the requirements for enlarging the decision power of America\'s
state managers\" \[Melman 1974,264-266\].

[The economic cost to American society of the U.S. war in and around
Vietnam entails far more than the Pentagon\'s direct outlays of some
\$150 billion]{.underline}. The full social cost includes interest on
the war-related debt, the value of production foregone, veterans\'
benefits, etc., etc. These are estimated at \$676 billion \[Riddell
1973\]. [The human cost in the United States and in Vietnam is
incalculable.]{.underline}

T[he magnitude of the decision-power of the Pentagon management has
reached that of a state]{.underline}. After all, the fiscal 1997 budget
plan of the Department of Defense- \$265 billion-exceeds the economic
product of entire nations. The **[state-management has become
a]{.underline}** para-state, **[a state within a state.]{.underline}**

At its beginning, the U.S. government was primarily a political entity.
The detailed managing of economic and industrial activity was to be the
province of private persons. This division of function was the grand
design for American government and society, within which personal and
political freedom (apart from slavery) could flourish alongside of rapid
economic growth and technological progress. [After 1960]{.underline},
this design was transformed. [In the name of ensuring civilian control
over the Department of Defense and of obtaining efficiencies of modern
management, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara redesigned the
organization of his department to include]{.underline}, within the
office of the Secretary, [a central administrative office]{.underline}.
This was designed to control operations in thousands of subsidiary
industrial enterprises undertaken on behalf of the Department of
Defense. [Modeled after the central administrative offices of
multi-division industrial firms-such as the Ford Motor
Company]{.underline} (which McNamara led before the Pentagon post), the
General Motors Corporation, and the General Electric Company-[the new
management in the Department of Defense was designed to control the
activities of subsidiary managements of firms producing]{.underline}, in
1994, \$110 billion of [goods and services for the Department of
Defense]{.underline}.

By the measure of industrial activity governed from one central office,
[this new management]{.underline} in the Department of Defense
[is]{.underline} beyond compare **[the largest industrial management in
the United States-perhaps in the world]{.underline}**. Never before in
American experience has there been such a combination of economic,
political, and military decision power in the same hands. [The senior
officers of the new state-management are also senior political officers
of the U.S. government]{.underline}. Thus, [one consequence of the
establishment of the new state-management has been the
installation]{.underline}, within American society, **[of an
institutional feature of a totalitarian system.]{.underline}**

The new organization is also significant for its effects in pre-empting
resources and committing the nation to the military operations that the
new organization is de- signed to serve. Finally, [the new management
center is important because of the drive toward power expansion that is
built into the normal operation of an industrial
management.]{.underline}

### L -- Democracy 

#### Neoliberalism turns democracy and creates an environment of misinformation that promotes fascism in the political sphere

**Giroux, 18** \[Distinguished Scholar in Critical Pedagogy, The
Politics of Neoliberal Fascism,
<https://www.tikkun.org/the-politics-of-neoliberal-fascism>, 8/21/18\]
-TB

**[Democracy is the scourge of neoliberalism and its ultimate
humiliation.]{.underline}** [As the ideas, values, and institutions
crucial to a democracy have withered under a savage neoliberalism, which
has been fifty years in the making, **fascistic notions of racial
superiority, social cleansing, apocalyptic populism, hyper-militarism,
and ultra-nationalism have gained in intensity** moving from the
repressed recesses of US history to the centers of state and corporate
power. \[]{.underline}7\] Decades of mass inequality, wage slavery, the
collapse of the manufacturing sector, tax giveaways to the financial
elite, and savage austerity policies that drove a frontal attack on the
welfare state have further strengthened fascistic discourses and
redirected populist anger against vulnerable populations and
undocumented immigrants, Muslims, the racially oppressed, women, LGBTQ
people, public servants, critical intellectuals, and workers. [Not only
has neoliberalism undermined the basic elements of democracy by
escalating the mutually reinforcing dynamics of economic inequality and
political inequality-- accentuating the downhill spiral of social and
economic mobility**--it has also created conditions that make fascist
ideas and principles more attractive.**]{.underline} Under these
accelerated circumstances, [**neoliberalism and fascism conjoin and
advance in a comfortable and mutually compatible movement that connects
the worst excesses of capitalism with authoritarian "strong man"
ideals**---the veneration of war, a hatred of reason and truth; a
celebration of ultra-nationalism and racial purity;]{.underline} the
suppression of freedom and dissent; [a culture which promotes lies,
spectacles, scapegoating the other, a discourse of deterioration, brutal
violence, and ultimately erupting in state violence in heterogeneous
forms.]{.underline} In the Trump administration, neoliberal fascism is
on steroids and represents a fusion of the worse dimensions and excesses
of gangster capitalism with the fascist ideals of white nationalism and
racial supremacy associated with the horrors of the past.\[8\]
**[Neoliberal structural transformation has both undermined and
refigured "the principles, practices, cultures, subjects and institution
of democracy understood as rule by the people]{.underline}**."\[9\]
Since the earlier seventies, [the neoliberal project has mutated into a
revolt against human rights, democracy, and created a powerful narrative
that refigures freedom and authority so as to legitimate and produce
massive inequities in wealth and power]{.underline}.\[10\] Its practices
of offshoring, restructuring everything according to the dictates of
profit margins, slashing progressive taxation, eliminating corporate
regulations, unchecked privatization, and the ongoing commercializing of
all social interactions "inflicts alienating misery" on a polity newly
vulnerable to fascist ideals, rhetoric, and politically extremist
movements.\[11\] Furthermore, **[the merging of neoliberalism and
fascism has accelerated as civic culture is eroded, notions of shared
citizenship and responsibility disappear, and reason and informed
judgment are replaced by the forces of civic illiteracy.]{.underline}**
[State sanctioned attacks on the truth, facts, and scientific reason in
Trump's America are camouflaged as one expect of the first Reality TV
president-- by a corporate controlled culture of vulgarity that merges
celebrity culture with a non-stop spectacle of violence.]{.underline}
Neoliberalism strips democracy of any substance by promoting an
irrational belief in the ability of the market to solve all social
problems and shape all aspects of society. [This shift from a market
economy to a market-driven society has been accompanied by a savage
attack on equality, the social contract, and social provisions as wages
have been gutted, pensions destroyed, health care put out of reach for
millions, job security undermined, and access to crucial public goods
such as public and higher education considerably weakened for the lower
and middle classes.]{.underline} In the current historical moment,
neoliberalism represents more than a form of hyper capitalism, it also
denotes the death of democracy if not politics itself. Anis Shivani's
articulation of the threat neoliberalism poses to democracy is worth
quoting at length: [Neoliberalism believes that markets are
self-sufficient unto themselves, that they do not need regulation, and
that they are the best guarantors of human welfare.]{.underline}
Everything that promotes the market, i.e., privatization, deregulation,
mobility of finance and capital, abandonment of government-provided
social welfare, and the reconception of human beings as human capital,
needs to be encouraged, while everything that supposedly diminishes the
market, i.e., government services, regulation, restrictions on finance
and capital, and conceptualization of human beings in transcendent
terms, is to be discouraged....One way to sum up neoliberalism is to say
that everything---**[everything---is to be made over in the image of the
market, including the state, civil society, and of course human
beings.]{.underline}** [Democracy becomes reinterpreted as the market,
and politics succumbs to neoliberal economic theory]{.underline}, so we
are speaking of the end of democratic politics as we have known it for
two and a half centuries.\[12\] What is particularly distinctive about
the conjuncture of neoliberalism and fascism is how the full-fledged
liberation of capital now merges with an out-and-out attack on the
racially oppressed and vulnerable populations considered disposable.
**[Not only do the oppressive political, economic and financial
structures of casino capitalism bear down on people's lives, but there
is also a frontal attack on the shared understandings and beliefs that
hold a people together.]{.underline}** One crucial and distinctive place
where neoliberalism and fascism converge is in the undermining of social
bonds and moral boundaries. **[Displacement, disintegration,
atomization, social isolation, and deracination have a long history in
the United States, which has been aggressively exploited by Trump,
taking on a distinctive right-wing twenty-first century
register.]{.underline}** There is more at work here than the heavy
neoliberal toll of social abandonment. There is also, under the
incessant pedagogical propaganda of right-wing and corporate controlled
media, a culture that has become cruel and cultivates an appetite for
maliciousness that undermines the capacity for empathy, making people
indifferent to the suffering of others or, even worse, willing
participants in their violent exclusion. Irish journalist, Fintan
O'Toole, warns that fascism unravels the ethical imagination through a
process in which individuals eventually "learn to think the
unthinkable...followed, he writes, "by a crucial next step, usually the
trickiest of all.": **[You have to undermine moral boundaries, inure
people to the acceptance of acts of extreme cruelty.]{.underline}** Like
hounds, people have to be blooded. They have to be given the taste for
savagery. **[Fascism does this by building up the sense of threat from a
despised out-group. This allows the members of that group to be
dehumanised.]{.underline}** Once that has been achieved, you can
gradually up the ante, working through the stages from breaking windows
to extermination.\[13\] What is often labeled as an economic crisis in
American society is also a crisis of morality, of sociality, and of
community. Since the 1970s, increasing unregulated capitalism has
hardened into a form of market fundamentalism that has accelerated the
hollowing out of democracy through its capacity to reshape the
commanding political, social, and economic institutions of American
society, making it vulnerable to the fascist solutions proposed by
Trump. As an integrated system of structures, ideologies, and values,
neoliberalism economizes every aspect of life, separates economic
activity from social costs, and depoliticizes the public through
corporate controlled disimagination machines that trade in post-truth
narratives, enshrine the spectacle of violence, debase language, and
distort history. [Neoliberalism now wages a battle against any viable
notion of the social, solidarity, the collective imagination, the public
good, and the institutions that support them. As the realm of the
political is defined in strictly economic terms, the institutions,
public goods, formative cultures, and modes of identity essential to a
democracy disappear along with the informed citizens necessary to
sustain them.]{.underline}

#### Rhetoric of US heg promoting democracy/freedom bolsters its ability to structure the global economy in self-fulfilling neoliberal tactics 

**Shariati '08** (Mehdi, PhD Professor of Economics at Kansas City
Kansas, "Socializing the Cost of Globalization, Imperialism, and
Militarism: The Case of U.S. National Debt,"
https://www.kckcc.edu/files/docs/ejournal/volume-two/number-one-march-2008/socializing-the-cost-of-globalization-imperialism-and-militarism-the-case-of-u-s-national-debt.pdf?origin_team=TKG0WGK4J)/ly

The mapping of a truly hegemonic global capitalist system began in
earnest in the period immediately after World War II-the beginning of
the era of what Ernst Mandel called \"late capitalism.\" The concerted
efforts toward a strong bloc of capitalist states with overwhelming
political, economic and military power involved the incorporation of
colonial and post-colonial social formations as reproducible capitalist
entities into the system. In this regard the creation of an
international capitalist class alliance equipped with modernization
theory anchored on Social Darwinism was indispensable. [As the
leader]{.underline} of the \"free World\" [the United States assumed the
greatest role in the implementation of the **hegemonic strategy** for
the purpose of **capital accumulation** through its military, economic
and political might.]{.underline} Attempting to understand and to
address the new World Order and all of its contradictions, forced many
to revisit classical theories of imperialism and introduced various
theories on capitalist states and state in capitalist societies . In
both cases an analysis of systemic contradictions took the center stage.
Systemic contradictions as they relate to accumulation have been
addressed by classic and most recent theories of imperialism,
dependency/world system argument, internationalization of capital,
global capitalist class alliance, and the transnational \"historical
bloc.\" A very useful angle of revisiting imperialism and global class
conflict is the \"transnational historical materialism\" (Murphy, 1994;
Augelli and Murphy, 1998; Cox, 1981, 1983, 1993; Gil 1990, 1993, 1995,
Rupert, 1995; Robinson, 1998, 2001). The proponents posit a world in
which [the global]{.underline} or transnational [class supported by
a]{.underline} transnational political apparatus and [military power
expands its interest on a global scale]{.underline} and [at the expense
of the international proletariat\'s interests]{.underline}. Therefore,
[the class conflict on a national level is transformed into an
international class conflict.]{.underline} Embedded in this analysis is
a touch of Gramsci (1999) and his concept of hegemony, where [the new
alliance is sustained and its interests expanded through the production
and reproduction of ideology of the dominant class and their cultural
leadership]{.underline} (hegemonic ideas). Gramsci pointed out that the
Western ruling classes ensure the consolidation of their dominant
position by manipulating institutions such as the media, schools,
churches, and so on. The \"historical bloc\" composed of the
capitalists, state apparatus and the \"organic intellectuals\"
negotiates as a bloc with subordinate classes to ensure the structure of
domination and its reproduction. Although the bloc seeks to maintain
total hegemony, occasionally it is confronted by challenges from the
subordinates (the struggling masses). To confront these challenges, the
bloc attempts at cooption of the anger and opposition by changing
slightly the social and economic arrangements. Although not referred to
by name, [social imperialism has been historically the \"bloc\'s\"
strategy of dealing with challenges to its domination]{.underline}. The
strength of the bloc in this contemporary period is immense and enjoys
the assistance of a new breed of organic intellectuals well versed in
theorizing and structuring a transnational hegemonic order.
[Ideologically loaded words such as \"freedom and democracy,\" \"free
trade,]{.underline}\" \"free enterprise system,\" \"free market,\" (and
host of other free this and free that) [are embedded in a language which
aims at structuring the world in the image of the hegemon.]{.underline}
The new bloc as Eagan (2003:3) argues seeks the \"institutionalization\"
of the concept of \"new constitutionalism\" as proposed by Gill (1995).
New constitutionalism has three components: \"disciplinary
neo-liberalism,\" \"panopticism,\" and \"market civilization\"
(commodification) of everyday life. But it is essential that the process
of \"internationalization of the state\" -the conversion of the state
into a \"transmission belt,\" (Robinson, 1996) and an \"agency\" for the
adjustment of the internal structure of the state to policy
implementation needs of the global order (Cox, 1987: 254) is in place
and reproducible. Cox (1987:109) identifies three [distinct world
orders]{.underline}, each having its own hegemonic strategy, beginning
with the liberal international economy (1789-1873); the era of
imperialist rivalries (1873-1945) and that of the post World War II or
the era of internationalization of capital and production led by the
United States-the \"Pax Americana\" period . [Contemporary debate
surrounds]{.underline} [the concept of globalization in its historical
and structural context]{.underline} and impact. In fact [the two main
opposing camps regarding globalization have used the concept to
mean]{.underline} any one or various combination of
[internationalization, westernization,]{.underline} democratization,
trans-nationalization, civilization, [humanization,]{.underline}
enculturation, universalization, polarization, modernization and [as the
\"triumph of human liberty]{.underline}\" among others. But the
connotations of these terms vary and on the one end the apologists for
the globalizing empires and their agents regard globalization as any of
above as an improvement and others see them as synonymous with
subjugation and exploitation. A somewhat reminiscent of the
modernization/developmental theories of the 1940s and 1950s in the
Western particularly American Social and political Sciences projected a
postcolonial world as happy family of nations pursuing prosperity
through modernization (capitalist development). By reading the old
imperialist theories based on Marx (i.e., Lenin, Luxumberg, Hilferding,
and Bukharine) many have drawn a parallel between globalization of today
and imperialism of yesteryear (Harvey among others). [If globalization
is viewed as imperialism, it inevitably involves militarism and
militarism in most cases requires a form of nationalism]{.underline}.
[If globalization is viewed as an agent of change bent on reshaping the
World in the image of what capitalism requires]{.underline}, [then it
ought to involve suggestions for challenging its overwhelming
power]{.underline} while resisting the impossible attempt at stopping it
all together. The scope of this paper does not allow an exhaustive
treatment of conceptual convergence and divergence. But its implications
as they relate to the national debt are incorporated. The U.S. national
debt has been discussed on various occasions from many political
persuasions. Yet the [links to structural dynamics]{.underline} and
contradictions [rarely have been made.]{.underline}

### L -- Techno-Cap 

#### Technologically advanced weaponry is specifically central to capitalism -- allows for social control and accumulation

**Robinson PhD '18** (William, American professor of sociology at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, "Accumulation Crisis and Global
Police State")/ly

Marx and Engels (1978/1848) famously declared in The Communist Manifesto
that "all that is solid melts into air" under the dizzying pace of
change wrought by capitalism. Now the world economy stands at the brink
of another period of massive restructuring. [At the heart
of]{.underline} this [restructuring is the digital economy]{.underline}
based on more advanced information technology, on the collection,
processing, and analysis of data, and on the application of
digitalization to every aspect of global society, including war and
repression. [CIT has revolutionized warfare and the modalities of
stateorganized militarized accumulation, including the military
application of vast new technologies and the further fusion of private
accumulation with state militarization.]{.underline} The [new systems of
warfare and repression made possible by more advanced digitalization
include AI-powered automated weaponry such as]{.underline} unmanned
attack and transportation vehicles, robot soldiers, a new generation of
"[superdrones]{.underline}," microwave guns that immobilize, cyber
attack and info-warfare, biometric identification, bio weapons, state
data mining, and global electronic surveillance that allows for the
tracking and control of every movement (see, e.g., Graham, 2010).
[Militarized accumulation]{.underline} and accumulation [by repression
--]{.underline} already **[a centerpiece of global
capitalism]{.underline}** -- [may become]{.underline} ever [more
important]{.underline} as it fuses with new fourth industrial revolution
technologies, not just as a means of maintaining control but [as
expanding outlets for accumulated surplus]{.underline} [that stave off
economic collapse]{.underline}. [Digitalization makes possible the
creation of a global police state]{.underline}. The TCC and state
apparatuses at its disposal attempt to resolve both the economic crisis
of overaccumulation and to manage the political conditions of that
crisis, that is, the spread of global revolt and the potential -- not
yet realized -- of that global revolt to overthrow the system. [The dual
functions of accumulation and social control are played out in the
militarization of civil society and the crossover between the military
and the civilian application of advanced weapons, tracking, security and
surveillance systems]{.underline} (Graham, 2010). [The result is
permanent low-intensity warfare against communities in rebellion as
theaters of conflict]{.underline} spread from active war zones to urban
and rural localities around the world. The restructuring of space
facilitated by digitalization is captured by the notion of global green
zoning.

#### Techno-capitalism relies on the control of economies through global transnational capital and monopolization

**Langman and ryan '9** (Lauren Langman, Loyola University Chicago,
Illinois. Maureen Ryan, Northwestern University, Illinois. "Capitalism
and the Carnival Character: The Escape from Reality". Critical
sociology, 2009. <http://crs.sagepub.com)> kb

[Fromm began writing in the late 1920s when national corporations were
coming to dom- inate the economies of industrial nations, displacing
small producers and lower middle-class merchants.]{.underline} After the
war, he became more concerned with the marketing orientation typ- ical
of the growing, bureaucratically organized consumer economy. [Fromm's
analyses of modernity and its consumption-based identities took place as
that society was beginning to undergo major technological and
organizational transformations]{.underline}. [**National economies**
were being **transformed into** what is now **a vast globalized system
of transnational corporations, owned and controlled by an elite
transnational class (TNC) in which the production of consumer goods,
services and experiences** (mass culture, leisure and tourism)
**provides the bulk of vast profits.**]{.underline} The magnitude of the
changes that were about to take place could not yet be completely
envisioned. This new form of late modernity, often described as 'post-
modernity', is largely a society of consumption, particularly of signs
and spectacles.3 But how did American society arrive at such a point?
Historians such as Lizabeth Cohen (2003) outline the ways in which [the
years since the end of the Second World War have been marked by a shift
from a producer's republic -- that is, one that is characterized by
their mate- rial output and production practices -- to a consumer's
republic, predicated on the promise of consumption to better individual
lives and raise national prestige]{.underline}. The booming postwar
economy, which had rapidly converted from military to consumer
production, found a ready outlet for goods in the swelling American
populace. Not only did consumers enjoy a rise in their standard of
living from their newfound consuming power, but they also widely
espoused the notion that consumerism would create jobs, give American
businesses stability, and launch American cultural and economic
dominance in the global market, particularly in the face of looming
Soviet power. The shift to a consumer's republic has not been with- out
its costs; its benefits have not been evenly distributed among races,
classes, and genders (and in some cases it has created seemingly
intractable social problems), and indeed as we shall see, our economic
structures have had to radically realign to support the ever-growing
desire for goods and services. [**Since the postwar era, capitalist
production has been restruc- tured into a post-Fordist globalized
system** in which more and more products are more effi- ciently or
cheaply made either by robots or third world workers.4 More and more of
the economy is based on information and information processing. **And
lastly, many of these technological changes are devoted to the
production of a plethora of consumer goods, the universalization of the
mass-mediated products of the culture industry and a variety of con-
sumable experiences** -- the travel industry being the largest industry
in the world. These three moments of what Kellner has called
'techno-capital']{.underline} (1989) has also had two major
consequences. 1) For the majority of the population, incomes have
stagnated at best, while for a large number income and relative wealth
has gradually declined. The conditions of the bottom fifth of the
population have deteriorated significantly in the last few decades, in
terms of income stagnation, purchasing power, and the reduction of
benefits and entitlements. 2) At the same time, even for the privileged
classes, the nature of modern corporate life, buyouts and
conglomerations, flexible management, frequent job changes, outsourcing,
and downsizing have led to a waning of values such as commitment,
obligation or loyalty in the business sector. [The frequent changes have
transformed the linear, sequential nature of life from a con- tinuous
narrative to a series of unconnected, contradictory fragments and short
term superficial ties and relationships that have led to what Sennett
has called a 'corrosion of character' (1998). **But the real thrust of
conservatism has been the control of national economies by transnational
capital** and the domination of a neo-liberal agenda and race to the
bottom]{.underline} (of labor costs).

### L -- Militarism 

#### Militarized accumulation makes conflict inevitable and justifies expanding control in the name of economic security

- this has links specific to all ME scenarios

- as well as war on drugs/terrorism, drones (surveillance),

**Robinson PhD '18** (William, American professor of sociology at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, "Accumulation Crisis and Global
Police State")/ly

Yet [there is another mechanism that has sustained the global
economy]{.underline} and that pushes the system towards a global police
state: [militarized accumulation]{.underline}. While it is true that
unprecedented global inequalities can only be sustained by ever more
repressive and ubiquitous systems of social control and repression, it
is equally evident that quite apart from political considerations, [the
TCC has acquired a vested interest in war, conflict, and repression as a
means of accumulation]{.underline}. [As war]{.underline} and
state-sponsored [repression become increasingly privatized]{.underline},
**[the interests]{.underline}** of a broad array [**of capitalist groups
shift the** political, social, and ideological **climate towards
generating and sustaining social conflict**]{.underline} -- **[such as
in the Middle East]{.underline}** -- [and in expanding systems of
warfare, repression, surveillance, and social control.]{.underline} The
so-called **[wars on drugs and terrorism]{.underline}**, the undeclared
[wars on immigrants]{.underline}, refugees, and gangs (and poor,
dark-skinned, and working class youth more generally), the construction
of border walls, immigrant detention centers, [prison-industrial
complexes]{.underline}, systems of mass surveillance, [and the spread of
private security]{.underline} guard and mercenary companies, [**have**
all **become** major **sources of profit-**making]{.underline}. A
cursory glance at U.S. news headlines in the first few months of the
Trump government illustrated this militarized accumulation. The day
after Donald Trump's electoral victory, the stock price of Corrections
Corporation of America, the largest for-profit immigrant detention and
prison company in the United States, soared 40 percent, given Trump's
promise to deport millions of immigrants. The stock price of another
leading private prison and immigrant detention company, Geo Group, saw
its stock prices triple in the first few months of the Trump regime (the
company had contributed \$250,000 to Trump's inauguration and was then
awarded with a \$110 million contract to build a new immigrant detention
center in California; Le, 2017). [Military contractors such as
Raytheon]{.underline} and Lockheed Martin [report spikes each
time]{.underline} [there is a new flare-up in the Middle
East]{.underline} conflict. [Within hours]{.underline} of the April 6,
2017 U.S. tomahawk missile bombardment of Syria, [the
company]{.underline} that builds those missiles, Raytheon, [reported an
increase in its stock value by \$1 billion]{.underline}. Hundreds of
private firms from around the world put in bids to construct Trump's
infamous U.S.-- Mexico border wall (Robinson, 2017a). The attacks of
September 11, 2001 were a turning point in the construction of a global
police state. [The U.S. state **took advantage** of]{.underline} those
[attacks **to militarize the global economy** while it]{.underline} and
other states around the world [passed]{.underline} draconian
"[anti-terrorist]{.underline}" security [legislation and escalated
military ("defense") spending]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} Pentagon
[budget increased 91 percent]{.underline} in real terms between 1998 and
2011, and even apart from special war appropriations, it increased by
nearly 50 percent in real terms during this period. In the decade from
2001 to 2011 military industry profits nearly quadrupled. Worldwide,
total defense outlays (military, intelligence agencies, Homeland
Security/ Defense) grew by 50 percent from 2006 to 2015, from \$1.4
trillion to \$2.03 trillion (Robinson, 2017a). [The "war on
terrorism]{.underline}," with its escalation of military spending and
repression alongside social austerity, has collateral political and
ideological functions. It [legitimates the new transnational social
control systems and the creation of the global police state in the name
of security]{.underline}. It allows states to criminalize social
movements, resistance struggles, and "undesirable" populations. [The
circuits of militarized accumulation]{.underline} coercively [open up
**opportunities for capital accumulation worldwide**]{.underline},
[either on the heels of military force or]{.underline} [through states'
contracting out to transnational corporate capital]{.underline} the
production and execution of social control and warfare. Hence the
generation of conflicts and the repression of social movements and
vulnerable populations around the world becomes an accumulation strategy
independent of any political objectives. This type of permanent global
warfare involves both low and high-intensity wars, "humanitarian
missions," "drug interdiction operations," "anti-crime sweeps,"
undocumented immigrant roundups, and so on.

### L -- Governance Structure 

#### The US and other Western powers use forms of regulatory governance to exert neoliberal economic influence over East Asia

**Jayasuriya 6** Kanishka Jayasuriya, "Beyond New Imperialism: State and
transnational regulatory governance in East Asia", in *Empire and
Neoliberalism in Asia*, chapter 2, pg. 38-40, /MegLak

[The last decade in East Asia has been characterized by]{.underline} two
key pivotal moments. One is [a **neoliberal moment that unravelled the
policies, coali- tions and state structures that underpinned the Asian
economic miracle**]{.underline}; the other is the post-9/11 War on
Terror that led to a much more assertive and coercive role for the USA
in East Asia. [In]{.underline} each of [these moments, of course, the
role of the USA has been of central importance in pushing for more
neoliberal economic reform]{.underline} and in seeking to reconfigure
regional relations under the rubric of September 11. Most [explanations
of the role of the USA in East Asia are, however, resolutely focused on
a 'realist' understanding of this relationship]{.underline} between the
USA and East Asia[. It is this realist 'state-centric' view of the
USA]{.underline} in East Asia [that can be framed]{.underline} either,
in benevolent terms, as the country's exercise of a balancing and a
restraining influence on an otherwise potentially dangerous region, or,
more in terms of dependency, [as the unequal relationship between a
state with a preponderant economic and military capability and more
marginal and peripheral states.]{.underline} In contrast to this
'outside-in' perspective, I argue in this chapter that we need to adopt
an 'inside-out' analysis that focuses on the way the structures and
modalities of governance are exercised within the state rather than on
how they are imposed from the outside. In this context, I argue [that
**the relationship between the USA and East Asia be analysed in terms of
a new space of regulatory governance that**]{.underline} -- and this is
really the nub of the argument -- **[domesticates US influence within
the very structures of East Asian states.]{.underline}**

This inside-out approach needs to be clearly distinguished from those
which suggest that recent US foreign policy marks a shift from a
so-called 'benevolent' hegemony, typified by its posture in the post-war
period, to a more militaristic and coercive stance. For Perry Anderson
(2002), the end of the Cold War and the advance of economic
globalization changed the equlibrium between the force and consent that
drove US policy in the period after the Second World War. Instead, in
the aftermath of the Cold War, the balance tilted towards a more
coercive hegemony, as: [**with the erasure of the USSR, there was no**
longer any countervailing **force capable of withstanding US** military
might]{.underline}. The days when it could be checkmated in Vietnam, or
suffer proxy defeat in Southern Africa were over.
**[These]{.underline}** interrelated [**changes were eventually bound to
alter the role of the United States in the World**. The chemical formula
of power was in solution.]{.underline}

This is not an isolated example. The recently fashionable terms of
'empire' or 'new imperialism' are replete with the assumption that
hegemony is, in some sense, exercised in direct fashion over a
subordinate state (Ignatieff 2003; Harvey 2003a).1 The problem with this
line of reasoning is that it elides the significant transformation in
the nature of the state as well as the broader global environment in
which it operates. Most accounts of hegemony seem to have missed the
decisive way in which [recent changes in the global order reflect a far
deeper mutation in the modes and mechanisms of political rule that are
embodied in the arrangement of transnational regulatory
governance.]{.underline} In fact, as Woods (2003) has persuasively
argued, **[the USA in the post-war period has mostly exercised control
through indirect]{.underline}** rather than direct
**[means]{.underline}**. As Woods notes: a [distinctive and essential
characteristic of capitalist imperialism \[is\] that its economic reach
far exceeds its direct political and military grasp.]{.underline} It can
only rely on the economic imperatives of 'the market' to do much of its
imperial work. [This]{.underline} sharply [differentiates it from
earlier forms of economic imperialism, which depended directly on such
extra economic powers]{.underline} -- whether territorial empires which
could reach only as far as the capacity of their direct coercive powers
to impose their rule, or commercial empires whose advantage depended on
domination of the seas or other trade routes.

Persuasive as Woods is in emphasizing the fact that the state is as
crucial as ever in ensuring the maintenance and stability of markets,
her account leaves out the way in which **[the state is being
transformed through the operation of global economic
imperatives]{.underline}**. It is this transformation that we have tried
to grasp through the notion of transnational regulatory governance.
Further, [it is **this transnational regulatory
governance**]{.underline} -- and here I part company with writers such
as Woods (2003) and Harvey (2003a) -- [that has **enmeshed** all the
**major capitalist economies in a manner**]{.underline} that Kautsky
(1970) **[described as 'ultra imperialism']{.underline}**. Ultra impe-
rialism [refers to]{.underline} what Kautsky thought to be [the
deepening engagement among core capitalist countries, an engagement
driven by the imperatives of global as opposed to national
capitalism.]{.underline} Tempting as it may be in the aftermath of 9/11
to resuscitate various notions of hegemony or new imperialism, the fact
remains that these notions of hegemony or new imperialism are trapped
within the Westphalian framework. In contrast, my argument is that
[**the intensification of global capitalism creates the conditions for
the emergence of new webs of regulatory governance**, which link
capitalist states together in what may be called a globalized form of
ultra imperialism]{.underline}.

[The idea of globality]{.underline}2 proposed by Shaw (2000) [is useful
in this context.]{.underline} Shaw suggests that [**globality may be
found 'in the dominance of a single set of new norms and institutions,
which more or less governs the various state centres**']{.underline}. In
turn, Shaw's notion of globality bears resemblance to the early work of
Keohane and Nye (1977) on complex interdependence, and presents a very
different perspective to Kautsky's (1970) notion of ultra imperialism.
Working within a similar transnational state framework, Robinson (2004)
has used the notion of transnational state apparatus, which is defined
as 'an emerging network that comprises transformed and externally
integrated national states, together with the supranational economic and
political forums, and has not yet acquired any centralised institutional
form' (Robinson 2004: 88). Supplementing Robinson's claim for a
transnational state is the claim that [**economic globalization has
produced a new transna- tional capitalist class whose political
counterpart is the emergence of a new transnational state
apparatus**.]{.underline} Rather than construing this entity as a new
form of globality or as a transnational state apparatus, however, [it
is]{.underline} much more [useful to see the emergence of this new ultra
imperialism as the creation of often multiple regulatory spaces that cut
across the boundaries of the national and the
transnational]{.underline}.3 This chapter is a first cut at seeking

#### The aff's attempt to maintain the liberal international order reifies imperial notions and material inequality

[The foundational values]{.underline}, interests and institutions [of
the]{.underline} (Anglo-)[US liberal international orde]{.underline}r,
with due respect for important but not fundamental recalibrations and
corrections along the way, [are the sources of its current crises or at
least challenges]{.underline}. **[The mentalities and power structures
of the LIO's leaders are constructed by hierarchical, imperial and
racial--civilizational ways of thinking]{.underline}**, albeit in most
cases subliminally embedded to the point of being unconscious deep
structures themselves.117 The American white Anglo-Saxon Protestant
([Wasp]{.underline}) establishment [built and maintained the liberal
order in a 'competitively cooperative' alliance with their British
counterparts, whose own **imperial and racial mentalities** were hardly
in conflict with those of their American cousins]{.underline}.119
Whatever changes occurred or were forced on US elites over time,
**[those underlying and mainly subliminal values have remained
significant in decision-making]{.underline}**, **[including when
nurturing new states and powers]{.underline}** such as South Korea and
China. As a result, [liberal internationalism as a 'theory' or approach
to world order]{.underline}, eliding and skirting matters of hierarchy,
race and class just as it does in its outline understandings of American
democracy, [misses a critical part of the picture---of the dynamics of
international power as well as the dynamics of domestic
power]{.underline}. Because of that elision, that failure to see, I
suggest it is a legitimating ideology of the American ruling elite. I
have argued above that [the LIO is better understood as a system of
hierarchy and inequality]{.underline}, and as what Persaud calls a
'racio-civilizational' phenomenon. What does that mean? It means that
[this system and its leaders cannot yet **comprehend an order that
encompasses on the basis of something approaching equality** the broad
mass of people]{.underline}---citizens---at home, let alone the
non-western peoples of the global South, or even their elites. The tweet
from Donald Tusk quoted above is revealing and instructive because it
was addressed to President Trump in simple and stark terms, worth
repeating here: 'Euro-Atlanticism means the free world cooperating to
prevent post-West world order'---so, please 'do not touch'.
[**International alliances** of elites, including those of the emerging
powers such as China, **are in large part attempts to manage and channel
change to prevent radical power shifts**]{.underline}, **[to sustain a
world order that serves elites and masses,]{.underline}** in West and
East, in starkly unequal ways. A Gramscian--Kautskyian synthesis
combines consideration of domestic and international class-based
imperial hegemonies and offers a good explanation of the existing order.
However, it also offers a way out, in theory, and provides ways to
assess the likelihood of avenues towards egalitarianism being taken by
ruling elites. The prognosis is not positive at present, although the
bases of ways forward appear to be coming into view as political strife
and electoral shocks challenge the status quo.12

1.[The dynamic forces of capitalist development are]{.underline} both
[global in their reach]{.underline} and uneven in their outcomes.
Furthermore [the capital accumulation process engages both the
geo-economics of capital]{.underline}---the advance of capital in time
and place---[and the agency of the imperial state in facilitating this
advance]{.underline}: the geopolitics of capital. 2. **[Class analysis
provides an essential tool for grasping the changing economic and
political dynamics of imperial power in the various conjunctures of
capitalist development]{.underline}**. It allows us to trace out
different stages in the development of the forces of production and the
corresponding relations of production and dynamics of class struggle.
These dynamics, which we have traced out in the Latin American context,
are both internal and international, implicating both the capital-labour
relation and a north-south divide in the world capitalist system. 3.
Whereas in the 1980s [imperialism]{.underline} was called upon to remove
the obstacles to the advance of capital and to facilitate the flow of
productive investment into the region in the new millennium it [has been
called upon to assist capital in its relation of conflict with the
communities directly affected by the operations of extractive
capital]{.underline}, as well as cope with the broader resistance
movement. 4. The shift in world economic power in the new millennium,
and the new geoeconomics of capital in the region, have significant
implications for US imperialism and US-Latin American relations,
reducing both the scope of US state power and the capacity of Washington
to dictate policy or dominate economic and political relations. This is
reflected inter alia in the formation of CELAC, a new political
organisation of states that explicitly excludes the United States and
Canada, the two imperial states on the continent. 5. The new millennium,
in conditions of a heightened global demand for natural resources, the
demise of neoliberalism as an economic model and a number of popular
upheavals and mass mobilizations, released new forces of resistance and
a dynamic process of regime change. 6. The centre-left regimes that came
to power under these conditions called for public ownership of society's
wealth of natural resources, the stratification and renationalization of
privatized firms, the regulation of extractive capital in regard to its
negative impact on livelihoods and the environment (mother nature), and
the inclusionary activism of the state in securing a progressive
redistribution of wealth and income. As in the 1990s, the fundamental
agency of this political development process were the social movements
with their social base in the indigenous communities of peasant farmers
and a rural proletariat of landless or near-landless workers. These
[movements mobilized the forces of resistance against both the
neoliberal agenda of "structural reform" in macroeconomic
policy]{.underline}, the negative socio-environmental impact of
extractive capitalism, and the projection of imperial power in the
region. 7. [**These forces of change and resistance did not lead to a
break with capitalism**.]{.underline} Instead some of "[centre-left"
regimes took power and]{.underline}, benefitting from high commodity
prices, [proceeded to stimulate an economic recovery and with it an
improvement in the social condition of the population]{.underline}
(extreme poverty). [But the policies of these regimes led to the
demobilization of the social movements and a normalization of relations
with Washington]{.underline}, albeit with greater state autonomy. In
this context Washington in this period lost allies and collaborator
clients in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Bolivia, Venezuela and
Ecuador---and, subsequently faced strong opposition throughout the
region. However, Washington retained or regained clients in Panama,
Costa Rica, Honduras, Colombia, Peru, Mexico and Chile. Of equal
importance the centre-left regimes that emerged in the region stabilized
capitalism, holding the line or blocking any move to reverse the
privatization policy of earlier regimes or to move substantively towards
what President Hugo Chávez termed "the socialism of the 21st century."
8. The fluidity of US power relations with Latin America is a product of
the continuities and changes that have unfolded in Latin America. Past
hegemony continues to weigh heavily but the future augurs a continued
decline. Barring major regime breakdowns in Latin America, [the
probability is of greater divergences in policy and a sharpening of
existing contradictions between the spouting of rhetoric and political
practice on the political left.]{.underline} 9. In the sphere of
military influence and political intervention, collaborators of the US
suffered major setbacks in their attempted coups in Venezuela (2002,
2003) and Bolivia (2008), and in Ecuador with the closing of the
military base in Manta; but they were successful in Honduras (2009). The
US secured a military base agreement with Colombia, a major potential
military ally against Venezuela, in 2009. However, with a change in the
presidency in Colombia, Washington suffered a partial setback with the
reconciliation between President Chávez and Santos. A lucrative 8
billion US dollars trade agreements with Venezuela trumped Colombia's
military-base agreements with Washington. 10.It is unlikely that the
Latin American countries that are pursuing an extractivist strategy of
national development based on the extraction of natural resources and
the export of primary commodities will be able to sustain the rapid
growth in the context of contradictions that are endemic to capitalism
but that are sharper and have assumed particularly destructive form with
extractive capitalism. 11. [The destructive operations of extractive
capital, facilitated and supported by the imperial state has generated
powerful forces of resistance.]{.underline} These forces are changing
the contours of the class struggle, which today is focused less on the
land and the labour struggle than on the negative socio-environmental
impacts of extractive capital and the dynamics of imperialist plunder
and natural resource-grabbing. 12. The correlation of forces in the
anti-imperialist struggle is unclear and changing, but it is evident
that the United States has lost both power and influence. Taken together
these historical continuities argue for greater caution in assuming a
permanent shift in imperial power relations with Latin America.
Nevertheless, there are powerful reasons to consider the decline in US
power as a long-term and irreversible trend.

### L -- Gun Culture

#### The affirmative is complicit in a violent, hyper masculine, and militaristic culture that is focused on the violence of weaponry, which perpetuates logic of elimination where our own ethical paradigms are sacrificed for the interest of the military state.

**Giroux, 18** \[Distinguished Scholar in Critical Pedagogy, GUN CULTURE
AND THE AMERICAN NIGHTMARE OF VIOLENCE,
<https://riseuptimes.org/2018/02/20/henry-a-giroux-gun-culture-and-the-american-nightmare-of-violence/>,
2/20/18\] -TB

**[The rise of violence]{.underline}** and the gun culture **[in the
United States cannot be separated from a transformation in governance in
the United States.]{.underline}** [Political sovereignty has been
replaced by economic sovereignty as corporate power takes over the reins
of governance. The more money influences politics, the more corrupt the
political culture becomes.]{.underline} Under such circumstances,
holding office is largely dependent on having huge amounts of capital at
one's disposal, while laws and policies at all levels of government are
mostly fashioned by lobbyists representing big business corporations and
financial institutions. Moreover, such lobbying, as corrupt and
unethical as it may be, is now carried out in the open by the National
Rifle Association (NRA) and other individuals, groups and institutions
invested in the militarization of US society. This lobbying is then
displayed as a badge of honor -- a kind of open testimonial to the
lobbyists' disrespect for democratic governance. **[But money in
politics is not the only major institutional factor in which everyday
and state violence are nourished by a growing militarism.]{.underline}**
As David Theo Goldberg has argued in his essay "Mission Accomplished:
Militarizing Social Logic," the military has also assumed a central role
in shaping all aspects of society. **[Militarization is about more than
the use of repressive power; it also represents a powerful social logic
that is constitutive of values, modes of rationality and ways of
thinking.]{.underline}** According to Goldberg, [The
military]{.underline} is not just a fighting machine.... It [serves and
socializes. It hands down to the society, as big brother might, its more
or less perfected goods, from gunpowder to guns, computing to
information management ... In short, while militarily produced
instruments might be retooled to other, broader social
purpose]{.underline} -- **[the military shapes pretty much the entire
range of social production from commodities to culture, social goods to
social theory.]{.underline}** The militarization and corporatization of
social logic permeates US society. The general public in the United
States is largely depoliticized through the influence of corporations
over schools, higher education and other cultural apparatuses. [The
deadening of public values, civic consciousness and critical citizenship
are also the result of the work of anti-public intellectuals
representing right-wing ideological and financial interests, a powerful
set of corporate-controlled media agencies that are largely center-right
and a market-driven public pedagogy that reduces the obligations of
citizenship to the endless consumption and discarding of commodities.
**Military ideals permeate every aspect of popular culture, policy and
social relations. In addition, a pedagogy of historical, social and
racial amnesia is constructed and circulated through celebrity and
consumer culture. A war culture now shapes every aspect of society as
warlike values, a hypermasculinity and an aggressive militarism seep
into every major institution in the United States, including schools,
the corporate media and local police forces.**]{.underline} The criminal
legal system has become the default structure for dealing with social
problems. More and more people are considered disposable because they
offend the sensibilities of the financial elite, who are rapidly
consolidating class power. Under such circumstances, violence occupies
an honored place. Militarism provides ideological support for policies
that protect gun owners and sellers rather than children. [**It is
impossible to understand the rise of gun culture and violence in the
United States without thinking about the maturation of the military
state.** Since the end of the Cold War the United States has built
**"the most expensive and lethal military force in the
world."**]{.underline} [The defense budget for 2015 totaled \$598.5
billion and accounted for 54 percent of all federal discretionary
spending. The US defense budget is both larger than the combined G-20
and "more than the combined military spending of China, Russia, the
United Kingdom, Japan, France, Saudi Arabia, India, Germany, Italy and
Brazil,"]{.underline} according to an NBC report**[. Since 9/11, the
United States has intensified both the range of its military power
abroad while increasing the ongoing militarization of US
society.]{.underline}** The United States circles the globe with around
800 military bases, producing a massive worldwide landscape of military
force, at an "annual cost of \$156 billion," according to a report by
David Vine in The Nation. Moreover, Vine adds, "there are US troops or
other military personnel in about 160 foreign countries and territories,
including small numbers of Marines guarding embassies and larger
deployments of trainers and advisers like the roughly 3,500 now working
with the Iraqi army." [**Not only is the Pentagon in an unprecedented
position of power, but also it thrives on a morally bankrupt vision of
domestic and foreign policy dependent upon a world defined by terrorism,
enemies and perpetual fear**. Military arms are now transferred to local
police departments, drone bases proliferate, and secret bases around the
world support special operations, Navy SEALs, CIA personnel, Army
Rangers and other clandestine groups]{.underline}, as Nick Turse has
shown in Tomorrow's Battlefield. Under such circumstances, it is not
surprising, as Andrew Bacevich points out, that [**"war has become a
normal condition \[and the\] use of violence has become the preferred
"instrument of statecraft."** Violence feeds on corporate-controlled
disimagination machines that celebrate it as a sport while upping the
pleasure quotient for the public. **Americans do not merely engage in
violence; they are also entertained by it. This kind of toxic
irrationality and lure of violence is mimicked in the United States'
aggressive foreign policy, in the sanctioning of state torture and in
the gruesome killings of civilians by drones.**]{.underline} As my
colleague David L. Clark pointed out to me in an email, voters' support
for " bombing make-believe countries \[with Arab-sounding names\] is not
a symptom of muddled confusion but, quite to the contrary, a sign of
unerring precision. It describes the desire to militarize nothing less
than the imagination and to target the minutiae of our dreams." S**[tate
repression, unbridled self-interest, an empty consumerist ethos and an
expansive militarism have furthered the conditions for society to flirt
with forms of irrationality that are at the heart of everyday
aggression, violence and the withering of public life.]{.underline}**

[increasingly dire as their conjunctions become ever tighter within
economies of permanent violence]{.underline}. The image on the cover of
this issue tells this story. It captures a mural that greets visitors at
the entrance of the Daechuri Art and Peace Village in Pyeongtaek, South
Korea, just outside of US Army Garrison Humphreys. In 2001, when the US
Department of Defense (DOD) announced plans to expand the army base,
Daechuri villagers launched a protracted struggle to save their homes
and communities from destruction. They held candlelit vigils, squatted
in evicted buildings, confronted the riot police, and demonstrated
outside the base gates. The protests sparked international attention and
drew antimilitary activists from South Korea and throughout the world.
In May 2006, 11,500 South Korean police officers and troops descended on
Daechuri and violently ended the uprising, using clubs and water cannons
to disperse the protest- ers. Although the South Korean government
destroyed the original Daechuri vil- lage, the local residents erected
the Art and Peace Village in its place to preserve the memory of the
struggle with photography exhibits, sculptures, and other art- making
projects. Next to the mural at the village's entrance, a wooden sign
announ- ces in Korean and English that this is "a war and brutality free
zone."

**[The classical Marxist theory of imperialism remains the best way to
explain the persistence and growth of interimperial
rivalry]{.underline}**. Lenin and Nikolai Bukharin, along with Leon
Trotsky and Rosa Luxemburg, developed the basic outlines of the theory
at the beginning of the twentieth century and an array of others have
built on it since. To summarize their case briefly, they argue that
[capitalism drives the great state powers to compete over the division
and redivision of the world system]{.underline}. Bukharin is perhaps the
most systematic of the classical Marxists. He shows that capitalism has
two tendencies. First, it produces a tendency toward
internationalization that drives capitals to seek new investments,
markets, resources, and cheap labor throughout the world. Second, it
produces a tendency toward the "statification" of national economies.
Thus [capitals, even multinational ones, turn to their home states and
in some cases fuse with them to become state-capitalist firms to project
and protect their claims against their competitors and their
states]{.underline}. As a result**[, capitalism produces both economic
interconnection and interstate, interimperial rivalry, a struggle over
which is to be the dominant world power]{.underline}**. **[To enforce
their position in the world, capitalist states develop massive military
arsenals.]{.underline}** In some periods, [imperial rivalry detonates
enormous wars for dominance in the system.]{.underline} Imperialism has
produced wars of various sorts---imperial conquest, interimperial
combat, and struggle for national liberation. Such [conflicts result in
either the reinforcement of the existing international hierarchy of
states or its recomposition into another one, a new order of
imperialism]{.underline}.11 But no order is permanent. Capitalism's law
of uneven and combined development upsets the international economic
equilibrium of the system and thereby the relationship between state
powers. New centers of capitalist accumulation emerge, and their states
challenge old powers and the structure of the world order. The result
has been titanic struggles between rival imperial powers like World War
I, World War II, and the Cold War. The relative decline of American
imperialism The United States emerged as the victor of the Cold War
after the Russian empire collapsed at the beginning of the 1990s. That
brought an end to the bipolar world order that had divided the world's
states mostly into two camps, one dominated by Washington and the other
by Moscow. In its place, [Washington attempted to establish a unipolar
world order, subordinating the world's states to its dominion and
enforcing free trade globalization on the world's
economies]{.underline}. During this brief and exceptional period in the
history of imperialism, most commentators from the right to the left
announced that great power rivalries were a thing of the past.
Neoconservative Francis Fukuyama went so far as to proclaim that the
triumph of American imperialism's model of bourgeois democracy and
free-market capitalism marked "the end of history."12 Such liberal
fantasies were not borne out in the real world. [The long neoliberal
boom from 1982 to 2007 fundamentally changed the structure of the world
economy]{.underline}, creating new centers of capital accumulation, most
importantly in China that transformed itself from an isolated economic
backwater into the new workshop of the world. Inevitably, Beijing began
to challenge the political and military balance of power in Asia and
indeed in the entire system. Aware of the growing threat, [the United
States hoped to subordinate China through incorporating it into its
neoliberal world order.]{.underline} [Things turned out differently:
foreign policy disasters, combined with economic crisis, **have brought
an end to Washington's unipolar order**]{.underline} and opened space
for China's self-assertion as a rising imperial power. First, the US
suffered humiliating setbacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. The George W.
Bush administration had hoped, by exploiting the 9/11 attacks on the
Twin Towers, to lock in American hegemony and prevent the rise of any
peer competitor by imposing American dominion over the Middle East and
its strategic energy reserves. Bush knew that whoever controlled that
resource could blackmail any power dependent on it, especially China,
which receives most of its oil from the region. After invading and
occupying Afghanistan, the United States aimed to overthrow and replace
Saddam Hussein in Iraq and then conduct similar regime changes in Syria
and, most importantly, Iran. Bush's plans backfired, bogging the United
States down in endless counterinsurgency warfare in both Afghanistan and
Iraq, and giving Iran space to increasingly flex its muscle in the
region. It is hard now to recall the hubris with which the Bush
administration, with its emphasis on preemptive strikes and unilateral
military action, declared its intention to use the invasion and
occupation of Iraq as a stepping-stone toward reshaping the entire
Middle East region. Indeed, Iran was the real victor of Bush's war in
Iraq. All of this led General William Odom to call the Iraq War "the
greatest strategic disaster in American history."13 Instead of
consolidating its hold on the world system, the war dramatically
weakened its grip, reducing American imperial policy ever since to
crisis management. [The Great Recession brought an end to the neoliberal
boom]{.underline}, opening a new epoch variously characterized as one of
secular stagnation, a global slump, or a long depression. The world
economy, even amidst the current synchronized global recovery, remains
plagued by underlying problems of overproduction; state, corporate, and
private debt; and speculative bubbles. This explains why recoveries
everywhere remain at lower growth rates compared to previous expansions
after economic contractions.14 The Great Recession hit the United
States, the European Union (EU), and their subsidiaries particularly
hard. While the American state managed to stave off economic collapse,
none of its policies have overcome the problems that led to the crisis
in the first place. As a result, while there has been a recovery, it has
been until recently an anemic one. By contrast, China hyperstimulated
its economy to fend off a recession and sustain its boom. More recently
that seemed to peter out, sending some of its tributaries like Brazil
into sharp recessions. China engaged in yet another round of stimulus to
reverse its slowdown, restoring growth to its raw-materials suppliers in
Africa, Latin America, and Australia. But in doing so, China has
exacerbated the problem of overproduction and overcapacity within its
own economy and indeed the entire world economy. [The United States is
trapped in a strategic contradiction. It has suffered relative
geopolitical decline within the neoliberal order of free trade
globalization.]{.underline} It has also suffered relative economic
decline with its share of global GDP shrinking from 40 percent in 1960
to 22 percent today.15 China by contrast has seen its political,
economic, and military power all increase---according to IMF
projections, China's 2016 GDP, at 14.9 percent of the global share, will
surpass the United States in ten years.16 But US capital remains
integrated with the world system and committed to free trade
globalization. Thus, the American state can neither continue
globalization as usual, nor opt out through protectionism as the Trump
administration seems to prefer.

During the long postwar boom, [the vast bulk of [US military
expenditures]{.mark} were [designed to foster private capital
accumulation]{.mark} within the US economy [and]{.mark} to [stabilize
the economy during business cycles]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words,
[they were designed mainly to prime the Keynesian pump of capital
accumulation and to stimulate the circulation of commodities during
business cycles]{.underline}. Military forces did intervene throughout
the Third World in the 1940s, \'50s and \'60s, but the [[size of]{.mark}
the [US military]{.mark} apparatus [cannot be explained]{.mark} by the
need to project power into these regions, or by a \"Soviet
threat.\"]{.underline} The [postwar US military buildup occurred at the
precise time (1948-53) when the USSR was economically, demographically
and militarily decimated. Into the 1970s, the constant theme in military
contracting was one of cost overruns, weapons that frequently failed to
meet specifications, the failure to deliver contract- specified numbers
of weapons (while the total sum of the contract was paid), the
construction of weapons systems that were then declared obsolete and
never used, and wanton profiteering]{.underline}. Moreover, [[military
spending fluctuated almost precisely]{.mark} and in a counteracting way
[with the business cycle]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Pentagon had enough
equipment to fight two and one-half wars, but no opponents.]{.underline}
The chief purpose of all of this was capitalist planning in a nation so
ideologically beholden to the free market that no other form of
Keynesianism would work. The Marshall Plan and subsequent plans to prime
the pump of accumulation on a global scale (e.g., foreign aid, support
for the World Bank), had to be wrapped in the trappings of the Soviet
threat to gain support from the Congress, the media and the voting
populace. Other forms of the welfare state were developed grudgingly, if
at all, in small increments. [Military Keynesianism became the uniquely
US way to attempt to 16 extend and stabilize the growth of the economy
in the postwar period.]{.underline}20 Since the 1970s, US militarism has
been going through a process of transformation. [[Policymakers]{.mark}
continue to [use military expenditures to counter and]{.mark} to
[control]{.mark} the velocity and depth of the [economic
downturn]{.mark}]{.underline}, but unlike the Keynesians they are not
concerned with using military expenditures to create a high-wage economy
operating at near full-employment. Rather, they seek a low-wage, highly
productive economy to enhance the competitive position of the US in the
world market. Yet the state planners also seek a particular advantage
they long enjoyed in the Keynesian era privileged access to Third World
resources and markets. Partly this access is secured through the US
ability to dominate the capital lending process to debtor nations. But
monetary violence can only assure access to those caught in the web of
the debt trap. For the rest, [the [US]{.mark} has [placed]{.mark} a
heightened [emphasis on]{.mark} functional [militarism]{.mark}. Military
spending today has become secondarily Keynesian and primarily
functional: to intervene in the Third World. [Functional
militarism]{.mark}, still enveloped in the rhetoric of the \"Soviet
threat,\" [is designed to address]{.mark} what the Committee on the
Present Danger-new right factions see as [a dangerous drift toward Third
World autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Renewed base construction
(especially in the Middle East and Central America), the creation of the
Rapid Deployment Force (now known as the Central Command), and the
emphasis on the conventional weapons buildup especially the Navy are the
major components of this program. [[Militarism]{.mark} is [one means by
which the US seeks to attain a prime niche in the evolving international
system]{.mark}. It aims at lowering costs of production via secure
long-term access to Third World raw materials, markets, and investment
opportunities.]{.underline} Here, in the military arena, the US has a
\"comparative advantage\" vis a vis the rival capitalist powers, with
its established military forces and bases and core of support at home
for intervention in the Third World. But the extent to which the Reagan
administration has been able to displace the \"Vietnam syndrome\" is
unclear. There does not seem to be a broad popular base in the US for
any prolonged and costly intervention. Another limiting factor is that
US allies/rivals like France and Britain have demonstrated a readiness
to intervene for their own purposes and to withold support for US
interventions. With the completion of the Siberian gas pipeline, the
Europeans are less dependent on US domination in the Middle East for
their oil supplies and may increasingly decline to follow the US lead in
the Third World.

3.4. International Law and Global Capitalism Bhupinder Chimni's role in
TWAIL scholarship is interesting. Although his writing is clearly
situated within the corpus of contemporary TWAIL, 587 it actually
stretches back far before that. For instance, in 1982 he authored the
piece 'Law of the Sea: Imperialism All the Way', 588 in which -- as no
doubt the title indicates -- he alleged that the Draft Convention on the
Law of the Sea 'legitimises the loot of the seabed through a legal
instrument'.589 In temporal terms, then, Chimni is much closer to the
original wave of Third World jurists. This is more striking when we
consider that his most systematic work, International Law and World
Order590 was published in 1993. This means it appeared 14 years after
Bedjaoui's Towards a New International Economic Order but 10 years
before Rajagopal's International Law From Below. We might say,
therefore, that Chimni is something of an intermediary figure, standing
between the older and newer generations of Third Worldist theorists. Of
course, one cannot directly read theory from temporality. But this
intermediary position is also borne out in Chimni's theoretical
positions. In 2010, he authored an article in which he stated the ten
authors that had most inspired his work. The authors he 585 Ibid., 29.
586 Sundhya Pajhuja makes a very similar argument with respect to the
central role of a universal Eurocentric narrative of 'development' in
international law, see Pahuja 2011. 587 Anghie and Chimni 2003; Chimni
2011. 588 Chimni 1982. 589 Ibid., 407. 590 Chimni 1993. 127 named were:
Marx and Engels, Lenin, Gramsci, Poulantzas, Habermas, Alexandrowitz,
Wittgenstein, Gandhi, Aurobindo, and Camus.591 Several things stand out
from this list. The first is its syncretism. The particular combination
of European radicals and Third World thinkers marks Chimni out as very
much belonging to the Third World radical tradition. 592 More important
are the absences. Notably, Chimni does not cite any postcolonial
theorists as influences.593 Finally, the list highlights the degree to
which Chimni considers himself part of the Marxist tradition. In this
respect, Chimni is much closer to the first wave of Third World jurists
than many contemporary TWAIL scholars. [Chimni's Marxism is
distinctively Third Worldist insofar as he attempts to analyse the
question of imperialism from a peripheral
subject-position.]{.underline}594 Given this Marxism, Chimni explicitly
outlines his understanding of imperialism. His starting point is that
there is an **['internal relationship between structures of capitalism
and imperialism'.]{.underline}**595 In his account, [capitalism has
always had a tendency towards expanding spatially]{.underline}, and so
assumed a global form. This means that, for Chimni, 'capitalism has
always been imperialist',596 [or rather capitalism has always existed as
a 'global social formation']{.underline}.597 This has wider implications
for the way in which the global economy functions. Chimni argues [that
because of this intimate interconnection between the 'domestic' and
'international' under capitalism, Marxists understand international
relations as flowing from the internal organisation of
states.]{.underline}598 Since every state sits atop a mode of
production, with a given ruling class, ['\[t\]he foreign policy of a
state is integrally linked to its domestic policy'.]{.underline} 599
However, because the capitalist mode of production is always and already
global, it is not the case that the international economy is simply an
agglomeration of various national economies[. **Rather capitalism
produces a world market which 'functions on the basis of an
international division of labour**]{.underline} which 591 Chimni 2010a.
592 Young 2001, 10. 593 It is telling that when Chimni deploys the term
post-colonial, it is with a hyphen, in the tradition represented by the
scholarship of Alavi (see Chapter 1, Section 5.5.1), see Chimni 2010b.

67. 598 Chimni 1999, 337. 599 Ibid. 128 defines the relations of the
parts (domestic economies/states) to the whole (the world economy)'. 600
At the same time, Chimni holds to a classical Marxist account of law in
which '[law and legal relations are reflective of the social relations
which constitute a particular society'.]{.underline} 601 Chimni argues
that [these observations lead to 'a perception of **international law
and institutions as a device which serves sectional global
interests'**]{.underline}.602 [The dominant classes in the dominant
parts of the international division of labour **seek to realise their
interests through international law**.]{.underline}603 For Chimni, [the
international division of labour]{.underline} has gone through a number
of distinct configurations, each of which [gave rise to specific
international legal orders]{.underline}.604 Each of these legal orders
did not simply mechanically express 'economic' content. Rather, each
'possesses its own internal structure and dynamics' which shape 'its
content and discourse'; they only allow certain 'sources' to count as
'law' and in so doing, 'define its boundaries'.605 In this way, **[it is
possible to police the content of international law and prevent its
transformation into a weapon used against the status quo]{.underline}**.
The first legal order was from 1600-1760, the period of 'old
colonialism'. This was characterised by a mercantilist form of
expansion, and the consolidation of states in the 'Westphalian' model.
Legally, it was characterised by a transition from feudal international
law to bourgeois international law. Whereas old colonialism was based on
the backwardness of European manufacture, and hence the need to
accumulate materials and goods, new colonialism (of 1760-1875) reversed
this. [A greater stress was placed upon colonies as markets for European
commodities]{.underline}. In this period, [international law emerged on
a firmer basis, more strongly structured around
sovereignty]{.underline}. However, with the growing importance of
colonies for European development, '\[b\]ourgeois international law
shrank from a universal law of 600 Chimni 1993, 221. 601 Ibid., 218. 602
Chimni 1999, 338. 603 Of course, the process is actually a complicated
one, with class interest not being directly translated into
international law, because foreign policy is a 'compound expression of
several factors: dominant class interests, the compromise with other
social classes, national security concerns, cultural anxieties,
resistance movements, and the distinctiveness of the international
law-making process', Chimni 2010c, 68. 604 Chimni 1993, 223. 605 Chimni
1999, 338. 129 nations to \... a Christian law of nations'.606 A whole
series of developments on the issue of state responsibility sprung up in
order to disadvantage the non-European world. These tendencies were
exacerbated in the period of 'imperialism' (1875-1945), corresponding to
that of monopoly capitalism. [There was a strong push to acquire new
colonial territory, particularly in Africa, and **international law was
key in enabling this.**]{.underline} This period was also marked by the
[transformation of international law into one of 'civilised
nations']{.underline}, a secular and purportedly 'universal' model that
'was inspired partly by the need to accommodate the rise of non-European
great powers some of which were not Christian'.607 Equally, [this law
served the purpose of **legitimising the domination of the colonies by
the European powers.**]{.underline} For Chimni, decolonisation was a
contradictory phenomenon. He characterises the beginning of the period
as a progressive phase, marked by the granting of independence and the
adoption of texts like the NIEO. However, from 1975 it entered into a
more regressive phase, in which these developments were rolled back.608
Chimni is keen to stress that, even though there was a progressive
phase, this did not mark the end of imperialism, but instead 'the
beginning of a new phase: imperialism without colonies'.609 1945-1980
was marked by the rise of neo-colonialism. This is reflected in the
character of international law. On the one hand, international law did
posit the sovereign equality of all states. This was coupled with a
formal universalism. A [fundamental plank of the legitimacy of this
order was that there was one international law, governing both the
powerful and the weak.]{.underline} Any suggestion of a 'dual
structure', as had characterised 'colonial and imperialist international
law', was 'no longer acceptable'.[610 However, this was matched by an
unequal distribution of power and wealth.]{.underline} Importantly, the
new states acceded to a law which had been written in the colonial era.
This was a 'geometrical expression of the hegemony bourgeois doctrine
exercises even today'.611 The international law of the neo-colonial
period, then,

1993, 235. 610 Chimni 1999, 338. 611 Chimni 1993, 255. 130 can be
characterised as 'bourgeois democratic' because under it -- as in a
liberal democracy -- '\[f\]ormal equality goes hand in hand with
material inequality'.612 This leads to the present period. In a series
of recent works, Chimni has attempted to chart the economic and legal
changes that have occurred under globalisation. Following a number of
theorists,613 Chimni maintains that from the 1980s, [capitalism has
witnessed the birth of a 'global imperialism'.]{.underline} What is
distinctive about this new configuration is it [that is driven by the
**interests of an emergent transnational capitalist
class**.]{.underline}614 This class is a truly global one, with no
particular ties to any national economy. It is [composed of the owners
and managers of transnational corporations and financial institutions,
whose **productive and investment activities take place across national
borders.615**]{.underline} In order to facilitate this, [it was
necessary to constitute the world economy as a 'functional unified
global economic space']{.underline}.616 [This involved guaranteeing the
provision of free movement of capital, the proliferation of global
standards and the creation of a climate conducive to the spread of
intensified capitalist accumulation]{.underline}.617 For Chimni,
international institutions have been vital in this process. In a role
analogous to the state in the earlier stages of capitalism,
**[international institutions have served to remove 'local impediments
to the process of capital accumulation'.]{.underline}**618 [The WTO, IMF
and World Bank have remodelled the economies of peripheral societies
along lines that make them much more attractive for transnational
capital]{.underline}. Similarly, these institutions have -- through the
agendas of 'good governance' -- reshaped political life. For Chimni, the
sum total of these developments has been a fundamental transformation in
state sovereignty.619 He sees them as giving rise to an 'emerging global
state'. The function of this state 'is to realize the interests of
transnational capital and powerful states in the international system to
the disadvantage of third world states and 612 Chimni 1999, 339. 613
Robinson 2004; Sklair 2002. 614 Chimni 2010c, 67. 615 Chimni 2004a, 8.

2006, 14. 131 peoples'.620 For this reason, Chimni argues, one can say
that this is a global imperial state. [The global imperial state is not
a state in a traditional sense]{.underline} of a centralised body with a
monopoly on legitimate violence. [Rather, the combination of
international institutions and their interventions into formally
sovereign states leads to an international network performing the
functions of a global state]{.underline}.621 This marks a [transition
from **bourgeois democratic international law -- with its location of
some elements of sovereignty within Third World states -- to a bourgeois
imperialist law**]{.underline}.622 Accordingly, Chimni speaks of the
'threat of recolonisation'.623 Immediately, then, we can note several
important differences between Chimni's work and that of the other
scholars thus far analysed. Firstly, Chimni does not generally use the
optic of 'civilisation' or 'development' in his account of the
relationship between imperialism and international law. Insofar as he
does invoke it, it is as a subsidiary concern, tied to the larger
project of the accumulation of capital. Secondly, he does not locate a
particular 'moment' at which international law's confrontation with
imperialism fundamentally shapes its content. Rather, his argument is
that, [on a material level, international legal institutions mediate
relationships of imperialism]{.underline}, and so embed their particular
contents. In this respect, Chimni is much closer intellectually to the
radical wing of the old Third Worldist movement. In fact, his particular
schema of the development of international law shows a degree of
similarity to that outlined by Bedjaoui. The difference, however, lies
in Chimni's greater insistence on the [structural interconnectedness of
law and imperialism.]{.underline} For Bedjaoui, the fact of the
anti-colonial movement as a social phenomenon had immediate legal
consequences. Chimni is more cautious. He understands that a given legal
order has a certain internal structure, meaning that it will not be
equally useful for all purposes. This was reinforced by the fact that
the developments Bedjaoui was celebrating were occurring under an
overall system of neocolonialism. It is perhaps for this reason that,
whilst Chimni is willing to grant that there was a progressive phase
under neo-colonialism, and that formal equality was a real advance, he
is unwilling to fully endorse the possibility of the NIEO breaking with
neocolonialism. 620 Chimni 2004a, 1--2. 621 Ibid., 5. 622 Chimni 2010c.
623 Chimni 2006, 3. 132 If so far, to simplify, we have encountered
Third Worldist scholarship influenced by postcolonialism on the one
hand, and Marxism on the other, it is worth briefly examining the work
of James Gathii. Gathii explicitly positions himself between these two
tendencies, stating that whilst he does not 'subscribe to the idea that
cultural and nonmaterial forms of oppression underplay the real dynamics
of oppression in economic structures and relations', it is also
important to unpack 'homogeneous or universal categories of
representation'.624 However, he thinks that these two approaches
'invariably contradict each other'.625 Gathii argues that the
international legal discipline is structured by a 'Euro-American
hegemony', which conditions its theory and practice.626 This hegemony
results from the fact that 'law does not stand outside the raw interest
of states', but exists in a constant mutual interaction with these
interests, shaping and being shaped by them. For Gathii, these interests
are not simply 'political', instead they are deeply intertwined with the
world economic system.627 Gathii, then, 'foregrounds the existing
reality of economic hierarchy and subordination between nations'.628 In
other words, Gathii's work can be situated in the trajectory of radical
and Marxist understandings of imperialism. Gathii explicitly defines
imperialism 'as the spread and expansion of industrial and commercial
capitalism',629 whereas colonialism is 'the territorial annexation and
occupation of non-European territories by European states'.630 These two
processes were associated with different legal regimes, the former,
property, contract and tort; the latter, the laws of territorial
acquisition. Gathii examines these social processes through the prism of
the East African Protectorate in 1895. He argues that the 'the project
of territorial conquest and that of the expanding capitalist economy
built on the extraction of surplus capital went hand in hand'.631
International law enabled and legitimated the process of territorial
expansion 624 Gathii 2000a, 1998. 625 Ibid., 2000. 626 Ibid., 1997. 627
Gathii 2000b, 2070. 628 Ibid., 2069. 629 Gathii 2006b, 1013. 630 Ibid.,
1014. 631 Ibid., 1066. 133 in order to create the preconditions for the
creation and consolidation of capitalist property relations. This was a
complex process that involved co-opting and transforming native
hierarchies and practices.632 It was this process which guaranteed the
emergence of 'contemporary Kenya' as a capitalist state. The internal
life of the state had been so restructured that by the time of
independence capitalism could be protected not 'so much through force,
but through "rights of property in the means of production and in the
product and by the impersonal operation of the market"'.633
Consequently, for Gathii, [the modern African state was created by
international law, as part of a project to embed and entrench capitalist
social relations. **This close inter-relationship between international
law and imperialism means that the former tends to reproduce Eurocentric
ideas**.]{.underline} This is particularly evident in the law on the
title for territory, where the legacy of the colonial period continues
to frame judicial accounts of the colonial past.634 Essentially, in
these accounts non-European territories are treated 'as mere
geographical and economic sphere in respect of which colonial states
entered into transactions, such as treaties, with each other'.635
Non-European nomadic practices are not treated as capable of generating
territory, and so their experience is erased from history

#### US international leveraging of I-Law serves to extend the systemic logics of capitalism

Economics, "A Critical Examination of the Concept of Imperialism in
Marxist and Third World Approaches to International Law," p.188-191,

It is in this more general sense that [Marxists have used the concept of
ideology to understand the relationship between international law and
imperialism]{.underline}. Particularly important in this respect has
been Susan Marks. [Marks]{.underline} explicitly disavows the Engels-
inflected account of ideology as misrecognition. Instead, she operates
with a critical notion of ideology.940 Drawing on John Thompson, she
[defines ideology as referring to the 'ways in which meaning serves to
establish and sustain relations of domination]{.underline}'.941 For
Marks, 'meaning' does not simply refer to 'ideas' but the 'broad range
of forms' through which ideas are communicated. This specifically
includes 'utterances, texts, actions, and images'.942 There are manifold
ways in which meaning can serve to establish and sustain relations of
domination and exploitation. But [Marks pinpoints a number of manoeuvres
which are typical of ideology, each of which possesses its own
particular 'discursive strategies'.]{.underline} The moves that Marks
identifies are 'legtimation', which is 'the process by which authority
comes to seem valid and appropriate'; 'dissimulation' whereby 'relations
of domination are obscured, masked or denied'; 'unification' through
which social relations are made to seem harmonious and coherent;945
'reification' which makes social relations seem as if they are not the
product of human relations and therefore appear Eternal and, finally,
'naturalisation' which makes 'existing social arrangements come to seem
obvious and self-evident'.947 Crucially for Marks, these strategies do
not reflect ignorance or illusion. Although illusion may be involved in
any of these, 'it is not a simple case of error or ignorance of social
reality'.948 Instead, ideology is concerned with the way in which we
act, in spite of our consciously held beliefs or awareness. Marks cites
Terry Eagleton on racism, where he notes that in sitting on a 'whites
only' bench, even if one is consciously 'opposed' to racism, one
supports and perpetuates racist ideology.949 In this way, then,
[ideology is less about people believing in the justice or immutability
of relations of domination and exploitation and more about the impact of
acting 'as if' they believe this]{.underline}. Mystification enters in
terms of 'unawareness of the extent to which actions \... and the ideas
expressed through them serve to shape social reality'.950 Although the
critique of ideology has generally been applied to cultural or textual
forms, it has an obvious resonance for international law. [International
law is a medium through which 'meaning is made and power is
shaped']{.underline}, it too is a form of ideology.951 **[Since
international law operates on the international plane, the 'relations of
domination' that it establishes and sustains are those of
imperialism]{.underline}**. For Marks, this occurs across and throughout
international law, but she focuses specifically on 'democratic
governance'. [Marks describes capitalist (imperialist) globalisation as
a system of extremely uneven development, in which an advanced
capitalist core exploits a periphery and semi- periphery]{.underline}.
Following Gill and Robinson, [she views the 'promotion of democracy' in
this context]{.underline}. When one examines post-communist and
'developing states' one can observe that the democracy which is promoted
for them is a 'low intensity' model, in which almost all the stress is
placed upon the form of elections.952 Marks notes that [we might best
view this **democracy promotion**]{.underline} -- as led by the US --
**[as a form of intervention into peripheral societies, designed to
influence their behaviour and to contain any popular radicalism
associated with social breakdown]{.underline}**. In particular, she
argues, low intensity democracy: \[M\]eets the immediate needs of
anti-authoritarian crisis, easing tensions, and restoring order. Yet it
does so in a manner that forestalls far-reaching structural change in
peripheral and semi-peripheral regions. Thus, the concentration in these
regions of relatively low wage, low profit, less monopolized economic
activities is not endangered. On the other hand, low intensity democracy
is linked as well to the project of expanding the reach of global
markets and eliminating the remaining barriers to the
transnationalization of capital. [It facilitates the penetration and
consolidation of capitalist relations]{.underline} \... Policies of
economic liberalization \... have greater legitimacy when pursued by
elected governments than when imposed by unelected regimes.953
International law's 'democratic norm thesis' is an important ideological
battleground for these developments. Essentially, [the democratic norm
thesis rationalises low intensity democracy.]{.underline} It does this
because, [for international law, 'the crucial factor is said to be that
elections can be monitored by international observers']{.underline}.954
Furthermore, it presents low intensity democracy as the 'general rule'
of democracy, and therefore implicitly posits democracy as a 'event'
which one reaches, placing it outside the space of political
contestation. The ultimate result of this is that [international law
ideologically represents low intensity democracy as a self-evident
definition of democracy, to which the only alternative is
tyranny]{.underline}.955 Thus, In Marks' account, **[the expansion of
advanced capitalist social formations into peripheral countries is
ideologically facilitated by international law]{.underline}**. [It helps
legitimate the breaking down of barriers to capitalist accumulation and
contains resistance to these processes within forms compatible with
imperialism]{.underline}. Although in theory there are manifold
ideological manoeuvres, in practice scholars of international law have
stressed the particular role [that international law has played in
separating the effects of imperialism]{.underline} from their causes.
Tor Krever, for example, has argued that international criminal law
'abstracts individuals from a concrete context in which they act' and so
tends to 'portray the incidents at its centre as resulting from "rotten
apples" and their bad behaviour, or "monsters" and their demagogic
thirst for power'.956 In so doing, international law obscures the way in
which the international institutions (and their interventions) have
contributed to the problems that international law purports to
address.957 As Marks has shown, [where international law does focus on
causes, it tends to recast these causes in distinct ways]{.underline}.
In particular, 'the investigation of causes is halted too soon',
['effects are treated as though they were causes' and 'causes are
identified only to be set aside']{.underline}.958 [The effect of this is
to divorce the poverty and violence that result from imperialism from
imperialism's logic]{.underline}. Instead, these symptoms are treated as
aberrations, which are pathological from the imperialism's normal
function.959 In so doing, this obscures the fact that some groups of
people benefit from imperialism,960 this means that '\[t\]hose who \...
live off the practices and processes that victimise others have been
allowed to remain comfortably out of sight'.961 **[International law's
silence about 'systemic logics' is thus a 'silence about
capitalism']{.underline}**.962 Thus[, a vitally important aspect of
international law as an ideological form is its tendency towards 'false
contingency']{.underline}.963 Such false contingency involves acting as
if things are 'random, accidental or arbitrary'.964. This 'help\[s\] to
sustain'965 the social relations of imperialism, because it occludes
'awareness of what it will take to effect change'.966 In treating these
effects as essentially 'isolated problems, unrelated to wider processes,
tendencies and dynamics at work in the world'967 [international law's
ideological function obscures imperialism's structural logic, and so
naturalises it. In this way, international law structures resistance to
imperialism,]{.underline} channelling this resistance into avenues which
fail to challenge its broader systemic logic.

#### Capital accumulation structures I-Law and imperialist logics.

This chapter has sought to show the way in which a particular
understanding of imperialism has shaped Marxist engagements with
international law. [It began by]{.underline} examining the classical
Marxist understanding of [imperialism as being rooted in the capitalist
compulsion towards endless accumulation]{.underline}. This acc[umulation
must necessarily transcend the boundaries of the nation state in order
to realise greater profits and stave off crises]{.underline}. Advanced
[capitalist states expand into 'backward' social formations, transform
them, and attempt to guarantee the continued conditions for the greater
accumulation of capita]{.underline}l. This gives rise to an
international division of labour characterised by a core of advanced
capitalist countries which export capital to the less developed
periphery. [The 'super profits' accrued in this division of labour also
transform the class structure of the advanced countries, with
substantial sections of their working classes having a material stake in
the imperialist system]{.underline}. At the same time, because
capitalism involves competition between capitalists, imperialism is also
characterised by rivalry. In this materialist vision, **[imperialism is
understood as a historically specific phenomenon, rooted in certain
inherent tendencies within capitalism.]{.underline}** Formal colonial
domination is just one form that imperialism may take. Such an
understanding has implications for international law. The classical
Marxist theorists only touched briefly on international legal issues,
but generally claimed that in the face of the economic imperatives of
imperialism, international law is powerless. By contrast, Marxist
international legal scholars argue that international law and
imperialism have a deep interconnection. This interconnection in
understood in several (sometimes conflicting) ways: as a structural
connection at the level of the legal form; [as an ideological
relationship in which international law serves to establish and
stabilise imperialist social relations]{.underline}; and because
international law mediates the (class) conflict thrown up by imperialist
social relations. At the same time, all insist that **[international law
is crucial for the establishment and working of imperialism. If
imperialism is a system driven by the endless accumulation of capital,
and international law has to be understood as embedded within
imperialism, then one needs to understand international legal doctrines
with reference to the logic of capital accumulation.]{.underline}** It
is this process which accounts for the continuity between colonial and
post-colonial international law and conditions the imperial
articulations of contemporary international law. As with the Third
Worldist scholars described in the previous chapter, Marxist scholarship
is not simply an attempt to neutrally 'describe' the world. The early
theorists of imperialism were revolutionaries, leading parties and
movements that were actively contesting capitalism. Bukharin and Lenin
were leaders of a party that was to take state-power and both played
roles in the Soviet state and government. One can say the same of
Pashukanis. By claiming an intimate link between capitalism (and
imperialism) and law, he was consciously making claims as to what role
law could serve in a post-capitalist society. The practical importance
of this is confirmed by the fact that when the Stalin regime turned to a
vision of 'socialist legality' Pashukanis was executed.1076

### L -- Clowning 

#### Romanticized visions of the carnival character sustain capitalism through universalizing a consumer society that embraces hedonism

- \* hedonism = self-indulgence, excess, overaccumulation

**Langman and Ryan '09** (Lauren- PhD Professor of Sociology at Loyola
University, Professor at Northwester, "Capitalism and the Carnival
Character: The Escape from Reality")/ly

As we have argued, [the radical reorganization of
capitalism]{.underline} -- from the outsourcing of industrial production
by advanced nations to a restructured form of globalized capital -- [has
led to the rebirth of the medieval carnival as a mass mediated
simulation]{.underline}: first as farce, then as tragedy. And [with this
commodified 're-enchantment of the world']{.underline},
[and]{.underline} universal mediation of [a carnivalesque mass culture
and consumption]{.underline}, [we see transformations of
society]{.underline}, culture and character that in many ways remind us
of the medieval social order (Berman, 2006). Fromm's [insights on
advertising and consumption clearly anticipated the changes in 'social
character' as consumerism was becoming the dominant cultural
paradigm]{.underline}. In this way, just as feudal/traditional society
provided honorific recognition and status based on family, religious
observation, military bravery and personal loyalty, [modern capitalist
societies grant recognition to the rich,]{.underline} the famous, and
the infamous -- indeed, today, most pop stars and icons embody blatant
transgressions, such as public nudity, flagrant sexuality, and
revelations of private life, as essential moments of self. As such, we
argue that [we are witnessing the rebirth of the carnival,]{.underline}
albeit [as commodity]{.underline}, [and with it, the emergence of a new
social type, the 'carnival character']{.underline}, although in some
ways s/he shares certain features with the 'receptive character' of the
medieval era. [This]{.underline} increasingly [typical 'carnival
character' represents the **intersection of subjectivity with global
capitalism** that **universalizes the consumer society** with its
obsessive concerns for **privatized** hedonism and
amusement]{.underline}. This has been leading to an enfeeblement of the
self and a loss of agency that is hidden by a plurality of masks and
commodified identities provided by popular culture (Langman, l992). [If
the 'marketing character' sold him/her self as a commodity, 'carnival
character' is articulated in fantastic forms of
consumption]{.underline}. 6 On the one hand, carnivalization as critique
of elites through reversals and inversions of norms has a very long
tradition. Indeed, such forms of normative inversion as protest have
long been a part of labor history, political protest and of late, many
anti-war demonstrations. 7 But [the carnivalesque as political protest
has largely waned in the face of the production]{.underline} of a
transgressive popular culture-mediated product, marketed by the culture
industries. However much it may reproach dominant norms and values, like
the medieval carnival and its many contemporary Caribbean and Latin
American forms -- even Mardi Gras in New Orleans -- [carnivalization as
a cultural form **serves a hegemonic function**]{.underline},
**[sustaining late capitalism]{.underline}** in its now-global moment.
This is especially so at times like the current crisis of the meltdown
of global capital.

#### Hedonism is a tool of global capitalism that naturalizes the idea of militarism and a consumer society -- encourages privatization

**Langman and Ryan '09** (Lauren- PhD Professor of Sociology at Loyola
University, Professor at Northwester, "Capitalism and the Carnival
Character: The Escape from Reality")/ly

[The]{.underline} other [distinguishing feature of the carnival
character is]{.underline} his/her **[hedonism]{.underline}**. For the
classical businessman, a product of ascetic Puritanism, [the
conservation of capital]{.underline} and sperm [served to **insure long
term 'economic success'**]{.underline} and salvation. For Weber, [the
rise of capitalism as a rational economy depended on the systematic
repression]{.underline} [of]{.underline} traditional and/or [affective
action.]{.underline} The rationalization of society, the domination of
drives by the ego/superego, and the 'civilizing process' were all part
of the same cultural moment. And surely [it was this constellation in
which the carnival culture]{.underline} of medieval society [began to
wane until it was stigmatized]{.underline}, marginalized and all but
disappeared. But crucially for our purposes, [it has now returned -- as
a]{.underline} [commodity.]{.underline} Whereas repression among the
bourgeois class was a critical element in the transition from feudalism
to modernity, once industrialization and mass production reached a
certain point in which there were likely to be crises of overproduction,
capital needed to invent or colonize new realms. It was in this context
that [capitalism began to move]{.underline} from the production and
transportation of basic goods and raw materials [to the mass production
of consumer goods]{.underline} ranging from home appliances and cars to
prepared foods, fashions, cosmetics and entertainment. It is at this
point that [the 'captains of consciousness' begin to insinuate the
desire to spend (on consumer goods) into the psyche and colonize
desire]{.underline} (Ewen, l976). But the critical thrust of advertising
and marketing was 'buy now' -- meaning erode the Protestant ethic's
internalized sense of restraint and thrift. While this process began in
the 1920s, perhaps the emblematic shift in consciousness took place, as
we mentioned, in the postwar era with the proliferation of consumer
culture. 9 While it encouraged occupational success, [the sign of that
success was consumer sophistication]{.underline}. Knowing which wine
went best with Ramsey Lewis and Oysters Rockefeller got the aspiring
young (male) executive laid. (Answer: a Riesling or Chablis.) For
Gramsci, informed by Bourdieu, everyday life and its embedded practices
can be seen as the point where ideologies colonize the life world and
insinuate character to secure particular historic blocs.
[Ideologies]{.underline}, then, [are not just cognitive frameworks, but
**norms of thought**]{.underline} and action [that have an affinity with
a person's character structure and **become internalized**]{.underline}.
As Reich put it, [once an internalized part of character, **ideology
acts as a material force**.]{.underline} Thus, as we have seen, for
Fromm, attempts to overcome feelings of anxiety and powerlessness
originating in social conditions led to certain 'mechanisms of escape',
authoritarian submission, destructiveness and conformity. Fascism and
now consumer society can both be seen as historically specific,
collective ways that people could overcome feelings of anxiety,
alienation and powerlessness; [in these]{.underline} historical
[moments,]{.underline} [people would accept the **valorization of a
militaristic nation-state** or the notion that shopping brings eternal
bliss]{.underline}. [**Privatized hedonism** can be thought of as an
**ideological justification** for a complex pattern of global
consumption]{.underline} in which consumers pursue a variety of themed
or simulated experiences provided by the culture industries. These
include mass mediated carnival cultures, theme parks and resorts, and
the rapidly growing travel industry that provides guided tours or ocean
cruises which provide simulated, themed environments (cf. Gottdiener,
2001).

#### The "carnival character" is rooted in a consumer society and reinforces the internalization of economic manipulation

**Langman and Ryan '09** (Lauren- PhD Professor of Sociology at Loyola
University, Professor at Northwester, "Capitalism and the Carnival
Character: The Escape from Reality")/ly

Since the pioneering work of Wilhelm Reich (1946 \[1933\]) and the
Frankfurt School of Critical Theory, [the critique of
domination]{.underline} [has created a space]{.underline} for
considering the role of psycho-dynamics within class society [to
understand the **internalization** of the authority relationships that
**sustained economic** and political systems]{.underline}. [This was
evident in Fromm's concept of 'social character' as a]{.underline}
historically [specific instantiation of selfhood]{.underline},
consciousness, [underlying **desires** and defense]{.underline}. While
his understanding of 'social character' was nascent in his analysis of
thelure of fascism as an authoritarian/destructiveresponseto anxiety and
powerlessness, he expanded this understanding to include receptive,
exploitative, hoarding and marketing manifestations. But does this
framework yet have any explanatory value in the present age in which
globalized transnational capitalism is triumphant, [the mass mediated
**carnivals** of its **consumer culture** are
**universal**]{.underline}, and the au courant tropes of social theory
range from the bland affirmations of the status quo to the postmodern
escapes into hyper-reality? We would like to argue that in fact [these
trends indicate the growing prevalence of a 'carnival character' in
which the dominant mechanism of escape is **privatized**
hedonism.]{.underline} [This 'carnival character' is the **consequence
of** technologically advanced **consumer society**]{.underline} and its
amusement culture which has colonized childhood to establish the
psychosocial foundations for privatized hedonism realized in
consumer-based lifestyles and identities. This has in turn led to an
enfeeblement of the self that is hidden behind a plurality of masks
drawn from popular culture. [If the 'marketing character' sold him/her
self as a commodity]{.underline}, [the **carnival character creates**
his/her **identity through** seemingly transgressive **consumption** in
an ever changing plurality of fusions and/or contradictory
appearances]{.underline}.

#### Carnivalization is a tool of late-stage capitalism to keep the populous strategically ignorant about the exploitation they're facing and stop proletariat organizing.

Thurow (1997) has noted the similarity of this new economic reality to
the Middle Ages. [The transnational capitalist class has radically
transformed late capitalism]{.underline} in much the same ways that the
rise of bourgeois capitalism led to the implosion of the feudal world.
Thus [we see growing income gaps]{.underline} as the new 'aristocrats'
of information [and masters of the financial universe gain greater
wealth and new 'serfs' of lower echelon services]{.underline} and
deskilled production [find it harder and harder to survive]{.underline}
with the various McJobs available in the market. But while the
traditions of the Enlightenment and capitalist contradictions would
suggest revolution, [there is little concerted protest or critique in
the USA.]{.underline} Berman (2006) has suggested that with the
privileging of faith over reason, the disdain of science and
acceptability of torture[, we have entered a new
medievalism]{.underline}. Thus **[we see a re-emergence of the medieval
carnival]{.underline}** as described by Bakhtin (1968). But that
carnival, as licensed transgression, as a time and place where dominant
norms were inverted and transgressed was a popular festival, was created
by and for the peasant populations. The nobles had their feast and
jousts. The peasant carnival typically critiqued the elites through
parody, mocking and most of all, laughter. And much [as the medieval
carnival sustained feudal society, **carnivalization today, as
commodity, as an essential moment of consumerism, now sustains global
capita**l]{.underline}. Why?

As we have argued, [the radical reorganization of
capitalism]{.underline} -- from the outsourcing of industrial production
by advanced nations to a restructured form of globalized capital --
**[has led to the rebirth of the medieval carnival as a mass mediated
simulation]{.underline}**: first as farce, then as tragedy. And [with
this commodified 're-enchantment of the world']{.underline}, and
universal mediation of a carnivalesque mass culture and consumption, [we
see transformations of society]{.underline}, culture and character that
[in]{.underline} many [ways remind us of the medieval social
order]{.underline} (Berman, 2006). Fromm's insights on advertising and
consumption clearly anticipated the changes in 'social character' as
consumerism was becoming the dominant cultural paradigm. In this way,
just as feudal/traditional society provided honorific recognition and
status based on family, religious observation, military bravery and
personal loyalty, [modern capitalist societies grant recognition to the

[most]{.underline} pop stars and [icons embody blatant
transgressions]{.underline}, such as public nudity, flagrant sexuality,
and revelations of private life, as essential moments of self. As such,
we argue that [**we are witnessing the rebirth of the carnival**, albeit
**as commodity**, and **with** it, the emergence of a new social type,
**the 'carnival character'**]{.underline}, although in some ways s/he
shares certain features with the 'receptive character' of the medieval
era. [This]{.underline} increasingly [typical 'carnival character'
represents the intersection of subjectivity with global capitalism that
universalizes the consumer society with its obsessive concerns for
privatized hedonism and amusement]{.underline}. This has been leading to
an enfeeblement of the self and a loss of agency that is hidden by a
plurality of masks and commodified identities provided by popular
culture (Langman, l992). If the 'marketing character' sold him/her self
as a commodity, 'carnival character' is articulated in fantastic forms
of consumption.6

On the one hand, carnivalization as critique of elites through reversals
and inversions of norms has a very long tradition. Indeed, such forms of
normative inversion as protest have long been a part of labor history,
political protest and of late, many anti-war demonstrations.7 But [the
**carnivalesque as political protest has**]{.underline} largely [**waned
in the face of the production of a transgressive popular
culture-mediated product**, marketed by the culture
industries]{.underline}. However much it may reproach dominant norms and
values, like the medieval carnival and its many contemporary Caribbean
and Latin American forms -- even Mardi Gras in New Orleans --
[**carnivalization** as a cultural form **serves a hegemonic function**,
**sustaining late capitalism** in its now-global moment]{.underline}.
This is especially so at times like the current crisis of the meltdown
of global capital.

Carnival Character

[T**he concept of the 'carnival character' as the 'social character'**
of our age **brings** together a number of **perspectives** **on** the
nature of contemporary **selfhood**]{.underline}. While we do not wish
to dwell on the clinical aspects of psychopathology in terms of etiology
or symptomatology, we might only recall Freud's observation that
pathology and normalcy were positioned along a continuum. Psychoanalytic
theory, having now moved away from instinct theory -- about 50 years
after Fromm had done so -- has shifted from a focus on neuroses,
compulsions and phobias, to concerns with the fragility of selfhood as
seen in narcissistic character disorders, false selfhood, borderline
personalities, and impulse-ridden characters. For more modern
psychoanalytic thought, the fundamental problems of today focus around a
weakened sense of self, an inner emptiness and meaninglessness, and
quests for recognition that belie outer manifestations of 'success' and
esteem that represent defensive strategies of compensation for what is
lacking. If the 'marketing orientation' was the social expression of the
phallic aggressive character, [the 'carnival character' is underpinned
by narcissistic pathologies. Such people, often charming and well liked,
though manipulative, generally have shallow, attenuated social ties and
bonds]{.underline}. For them, other people exist primarily to grant the
person recognition or, if the 'Others' are seen as powerful people,
attachments to them bring a sense of empowerment.8 They tend to be
highly manipulative, using other people primarily to gratify their own
needs. In the terms of Kohut (1977), [people become 'self objects',
existing only to serve the needs of a deformed self.]{.underline}

[The most typical expressions of the carnival character as the 'social
character' of our age are an **intertwining of self-esteem with a
self-indulgent privatized hedonism**]{.underline} located **[in the
realms of consumerism]{.underline}**, often using leisure as a means to
glean recognition and/or establish relationships. We are suggesting that
this character represents the intersections of culture and subjectivity
-- as a major segment of transgressive consumer culture writ large. That
is to say, [within the larger sphere of consumer culture, its
carnivalized moment has become a dominant segment and indeed, the
context that disposes the formation and embrace of the 'carnival
character']{.underline}. We would however note major class variations.
In the contemporary workplace, [those at the lower
echelons]{.underline}, who suffer the 'hidden injuries' of subordinate
status, **[are less likely to]{.underline}** locate their sense of self
in work and/**[or find their community of meaning among fellow
workers]{.underline}**, as has been the case historically (cf. Sennett,
1998). But do note that while some segments of the elite yet find
meaningful identities, dignity, and recognition in their work,
especially educated professionals, increasing numbers of upper level
managers and executives, technical elites, and a variety of upper
echelon service workers do not find work as satisfying as it has been in
the past. Many corporations, Google most notably, have attempted to
're-enchant' workers with their workplace by providing a substitute
'community' with everything from corporate yoga to child care to free
cafeterias. Of course, this is as much an attempt to keep workers for
longer periods as it is a gesture of community-building. As was
previously noted, 'flexible' corporations, rapid reorganization, and
short term commitments have undermined the centrality of work and
commitment to an organization in favor of 'success' in that work. And in
this world, success is more often based on images and appearances of
success -- which may be transitory and erode in a moment.

#### Suffocating capitalist structures kill the potential for effective carnivalesque movements -- there's no way to create spaces of radical joy in the constant grind of capitalist worldmaking.

**Robison 11** Andrew Robison, "In Theory Bakhtin: Carnival against
Capital, Carnival against Power", in Ceasefire Magazine, 9/9/11,
https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-bakhtin-2/

Abby [Peterson's studies of]{.underline} the ethnography of [militant
social movements emphasise]{.underline} an [affective structure similar
to Bakhtin's carnival]{.underline}. The experience of lived immediacy
and joy is constructed through a movement orientation to the enacted
event with no separation between actor and audience. [This serves as a
means to integrate movements without reference to standard techniques of
master-signification, though it does require 'action spaces' and in many
cases adversaries]{.underline}. Peterson echoes Bakhtin's idea of the
immediacy of activist 'rituals' as something distinct from theatre or
spectacle. David Graeber makes similar reference to puppetry and
creativity in protets movements. Figures of carnivalesque immediacy can
also be found in authors such as Hakim Bey and Feral Faun. One can also
liken Bakhtin's view of creating new combinations with Situationist
practices of derive and detournement.

Similar strategies can also be seen in social movements such as La Ruta
Pacifica, who use [techniques of 'social weaving' to recompose a sense
of empowerment against the fear caused by civil war and state
terror]{.underline}. Much of the state's power is based on anxiety. The
Bakhtinian hypothesis is that anxiety can be neutralised through joyous
experiences of collective festivity.

These occasions strip power of its performed mystification, breaking
into its ideological reproduction. They show its contingency by exposing
it to ridicule and distortion. And [they create a sense of counter-power
through the permanence of the creative force of becoming, counterposed
to the fixed order of being]{.underline}. It doesn't so much confront
state power as render it irrelevant and ineffectual.

[Whether this is effective may depend on the tools the two sides have
available]{.underline} to actualise their ideologies in spaces and
practices. State tactics such as kettling are specifically designed to
instil terror, as an antidote to joy. [The popular culture which
provided the basis for carnival is]{.underline}, in the most harshly
capitalist countries, [being destroyed by the penetration of the state
into everyday life.]{.underline}

[It persists]{.underline}, of course, [in many marginal
settings]{.underline}. We should remember here that [the Europe Bakhtin
discusses was itself a periphery in a world-economy focused on the
Mediterranean.]{.underline} [It is]{.underline} perhaps
[unsurprising]{.underline}, therefore, [that its modes of resistance
look like those of marginal sites today.]{.underline}

[Reclaiming]{.underline} contingency and [carnival in the dead
heartlands of the core]{.underline}, where people are strongly invested
in their official identities and the preservation of an order which they
believe protects them, [is a]{.underline} more [difficult
task.]{.underline} Traditional carnivals continue to exist in places
ranging from Germany and Notting Hill, London to the Caribbean and
Brazil. Other related phenomena, such as holi in India, also persist.
While state regulation is a problem, such events still provide platforms
for alternative visions and for political critique.One can also point to
carnivalesque aspects in practices such as graffiti, which may bring
'down to earth' such contemporary sacred as police cars, banks, or
corporate logos. And why do children so often add giant willies,
sex-acts, or swear-words to street-signs?The grotesque, exaggerated body
and the bringing down-to-earth of systemic abstractions are present even
in such small, apparently apolitical gestures. They signify what is
missing in the official picture -- much as those who perform such acts
are often excluded from the official world. They create a full reality
in which the world is restored to its fullness and creativity.

Overall, therefore, [carnivalesque]{.underline} remains a potential
counter-power in everyday life and activism, but [is 'cramped' in its
potential by the repressive construction of spaces of
monologue.]{.underline} [Medieval carnival was possible because the
spaces it inhabited could be carved-out and defended through the 'arts
of resistance' and the power of the weak]{.underline}. There is a need
to recompose such powers to resist, in order to recreate spaces where
alternatives can proliferate.

### L -- US Conflict Resolution

#### US attempts to resolve international conflicts are all a guise for deterring rivals from expanding their international role -- it ensures military supremacy and the ability control the global economy

The relationship between globalization and militarism should be seen as
two sides of the same coin. On one side, [globalization promotes the
conditions that lead to unrest, inequality,]{.underline} conflict[,
and,]{.underline} ultimately, [war.]{.underline} [On the other
side]{.underline}, [globalization fuels the means to wage war by
protecting]{.underline} and promoting [the military industries needed to
produce sophisticated weaponry]{.underline}. [This
weaponry,]{.underline} and the military in turn, [is used]{.underline}
or is threatened to be used [to protect the investments of transnational
corporations]{.underline}, [the agents of neo-liberalism, and their
accumulation]{.underline} and privatization drive (Staple, 2007). The
military is employed to crush any resistance to neo-liberal economic
policies. An example of this grotesque imperial arrogance is the IRAQ
OIL LAW. Iraq Oil Law is a wholesale privatization of Iraq oil pushed
for by foreign oil companies and private (mostly American) contractors
such as Bearing Point. Since the occupation, Iraq has become one of only
three nations in the world that give corporations all the rights
entitled to a human being (i.e. \"corporate personhood\"). Journalist
Naomi Klein describes Iraq as a \"modern laboratory for neo-liberal
experimentation\" (Buckly, 2005). As observed by Duménil, and Lévy
(2005), \"[Neo-liberalism is the ideological expression of the return to
hegemony of the financial fraction of ruling classes]{.underline}.\" [As
globalization continues]{.underline} to take effect, [large powers
will]{.underline} often [use their armada in support of the globalizing
agents]{.underline} enabling them to Cohen\'s admission of the role of
the United States military [in guarding the interests of the dominant
class is]{.underline} by no means new. On November 11, 2000, Richard
Haas stated that the American global hegemony requires an imperial power
capable of extending its control formally and informally. Implicitly
Haas is calling for greater social imperialism by claiming that
\--\"Imperialism Begins at Home.\" To Haas, the concern ought to be with
\"imperial understretch, not overstretch.\" [Full scale military
intervention]{.underline}, according to Haas, can lead to massive
destruction, but it [could]{.underline} be [rebuild]{.underline}, and of
course the task of rebuilding is always left to [global
corporations]{.underline} invariably from the imperialist countries and
their \'rogue\" allies. (cited in John Bellamy Foster, 2003).General
Smedley D. Butler (1935, cited in Pearce, 1982:20) boasting of his
achievements in 33 years as a Marine officer serving in all commissioned
ranks spending most of his time \"being a high-class muscle man for Big
Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer
for capitalism\" And bluntly put: The de facto role of the US armed
forces will be to keep the world safe for our economy and open to our
cultural assault. To those ends, we will do a fair amount of killings
(Major Ralph Peters, Constant Conflict, Parameters, Summer 1997, pp. 4-
14,). The forerunners to the modern day transnational corporations-the
East India Companies -used their navies alongside their merchant ships
to penetrate faraway land to grab their riches. Contemporary,
transnational corporations have continued with this tradition of relying
on the political and military power of their national state for
successful globalization and control of production, resources and
markets. \"Today, [the Pentagon is realigning and expanding its vast
international network of bases along the frontiers of the global
economy]{.underline}, such as in central Asia. And in places like
Colombia, U.S. troops and weapons are being deployed where uprisings
threaten corporate investments.\" In a recent public statement, U.S.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates, using Korea as an analogy, revealed that
the United States has no intention of leaving Iraq anytime soon. [Iraq
remains and will continue to present itself as a challenge to an
uninterrupted globalization]{.underline} and accumulation process [and
will remain as one of the greatest examples of military power coming to
the aid of globalization]{.underline} and accumulation. [U.S. political
structure has been promoting a]{.underline} radical and
[vengeful]{.underline} nationalism and [military
patriotism]{.underline}. Nationalism expressed in military terms ([the
militarization of nationalism) began with the emergence of \"national
security state\"]{.underline} culminating in the \"project for the new
American century.\" The plan for the American imperial domination of the
planet envisioned a \"new imperialism that would not \'hesitate to use
force if, when and where necessary, and... unilaterally .....\" It
anticipated what would later be asserted by Kohl and Feldstien: \'W e
must discourage the other industrialized nations from challenging
American leadership and from bringing into question the economic and
political established order. [We must keep such a military supremacy
that potential rivals will be dissuaded from]{.underline}, [aspiring to
a larger regional or global role\']{.underline}\" (Veltmeyer, 2005:9).
Wolfowitz (along with Ricrad Perle, and Dick Cheney among others) was
also the lead author of \"Project for the new American Century\"-the how
to of unilateral projection of the American military and political power
in the service of the empire (Veltmeyer, 2005:14). Not too long after
the script was written, the Bush administration \"used the last and only
refuge of truly unchallenged American global hegemony - its possession
of a sheer preponderance of military force - precisely as a tool for
shoring up its long-declining world-economic power by putting Uncle
Sam\'s boot on that great strategic economic (and military) prize in an
age of global petro-capitalism: the Middle Eastern oil spigot\" (Harvey,
2003). The neo-lib/neo-con fusion is personified by Wolfowitz, as deputy
Pentagon leader, architect of and apologist for imperial theft and US
corporate patronage associated with the illegal Iraq War (Bond, 2006).
They were cheered by the \"Israel firsters\" such as Irving Kristol,
Norman Podhoretz, and William Kristol among many others in the neo-cons
camp advocating \"Pre-emptive\" strikes (particularly against countries
like Iran) and similar suggestions advanced by the \"Program for the New
American Century.\" Invariably, the implementation of all of these
policy components \--[the accumulation strategy]{.underline} and process
[relies]{.underline} heavily [on the military power]{.underline} and
military Keynesianism [which in turn feeds the Military Industrial
Complex]{.underline} and creates massive indebtedness. Are there policy
makers who do not see the consequences of militarism and imperialism
abroad and the social imperialism inside? Few are willing to defend over
\$9 trillion in national debt, other than to acknowledge it as a
necessary evil that needs to be addressed. Ignoring it has become a norm
and even when it reaches \$14 trillion or more in 2013, it will continue
to be too \"abstract\" to understand by the masses.

### L -- Gay Bombs

#### Neoliberalism thrives on difference -- the aff's embodiment of a rhizome exacerbates that

**Wallin '10** (Jason J- Professor at the University of Alberta, Canada,
"Rhizomania: Five Provocations on a Concept")/ly

[Conjoined to the mobilization of the rhizome as an image
of]{.underline} complication and [plurality persists a more insidious
fidelity to the logic of neo-liberalism]{.underline}. That is, [the
potential of the rhizome to desediment and send territories into flight
bears marked similarity to the deterritorializing powers of
neo-liberalism]{.underline}, the machinery of [which functions precisely
by decoding and capturing social flows.]{.underline} For example[,
the]{.underline} contemporary [commoditization of sex first requires
that codes surrounding courtship become decoded]{.underline}, hence
removing those social mores and local rituals that would block the
circulation of sex as a diffuse and ambient commodity, available
anywhere at any time. [While the rhizome has been conceptualized as a
corollary of difference]{.underline} in much curriculum and arts-based
research[, difference itself is insufficient for thinking
liberation.]{.underline} [The **neo-liberal** capitalist **apparatus**
does not fear difference, but rather, **fears its
cessation.**]{.underline} It is in this vein that [the mobilization of
rhizomatics for the multiplication of subjectivity becomes equally
problematic]{.underline}, [since]{.underline} contemporary
[neo-liberalism requires the kind of pliable]{.underline}, dynamic, and
itinerant [subject]{.underline} celebrated by many contemporary
curricularists and arts-based researchers. In this vein, such [pluralist
subjectivities]{.underline} as the artist-teacher-researcher are not as
much radical as they [are]{.underline} perfectly [optimized for a
socio-economic vehicle that requires]{.underline} such
[post-structural]{.underline}, self-styling
schizo-[identities.]{.underline} As an operation of "variation,
expansion, conquest, capture, offshoots" [the rhizome must be
politically reconnected to the desires of neo-liberalism]{.underline} in
an effort [to mobilize becomings capable of]{.underline} (temporarily)
[escaping]{.underline} or infecting forces of [neo-liberal
capture.]{.underline} Toward this, curricularists and artsbased
[researchers must begin to link the rhizome alongside i]{.underline}ts
Deleuzeguattarian counterpart: [the war-machine]{.underline}. As Deleuze
and Guattari aver, [the war-machine operates as a]{.underline}
subterranean [counterforce to the stratifying powers of the
State]{.underline}, emerging contemporarily in the figure of the
computer hacker, urban guerilla, and terrorist.

#### The aff's technocratic use of the Gay Bomb reifies capitalist strucutres through commodifying the body as transplantable

**Vandenberghe, 2008** (Frederic, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,
*Philosophy Social Criticism* 2008,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0191453708095696>, SHD)

Having colonized the life-world, [capitalism turns its attention to
nature and invades life itself to modify and commodify it.]{.underline}
Since the late 1970s, the large multinational corporations, which had
closely observed the developments in molecular biology and genetic
engineering, began to invest substantially in biotechnology. Dependent
on the universities for their expertise and on oil, [chemical and
pharmaceutical corporations for capital, the biotech industry rapidly
enrolled the biosciences to redesign, patent and re-engineer life itself
for commercial purposes]{.underline}. The first transgenic organisms
appeared in the 1980s and, by 1988, OncomouseTM, a transgenic mouse,
designed for research in cancer and marketed by Du Pont at \$50 to \$75
per piece, became the first patented animal in the world (Haraway, 1997:
49--118). Since then, the bio- sciences have made great progress and,
using viruses as vectors for transmitting DNA between different species,
they have fabricated and patented some of the most monstrous creatures
for the sake of profit: tobacco plants with firefly genes; fish and
tomatoes with anti-freeze genes; headless embryos of mice and frogs,
dispensing with their super- fluous heads so that that they can harvest
their organs; monkeys with jellyfish genes and human embryo cells merged
with enucleated cows' eggs; cloned calves and sheep carrying human
genes, cows producing lactoferrin, a human protein useful for treating
infections; and not to forget, Dollies, sheep that are cloned, and
Pollies, sheep that are both cloned and genetically engineered (Best and
Kellner, 2001: 171--5).∂ Involved in a highly competitive race for the
human race, the private corporation Celera Genomics and the publicly
funded Human Genome Project announced in 2000 that they had completed a
rough draft of the entire human genome. While the atlas of the genome
can be consulted against payment, the question about the ownership of
the human genome remains unsolved: does the human genome belong to the
individual person with a particular genome, to the scientist or the
company that has identified particular genes or nucleotide sequences, or
is it the common heritage of humankind? The question is momentous: if
the human genome is the collective property of humanity, deliberative
intervention should never occur without collective deliberation. If it
is not, then the genome can be patented, privatized and subjected to
monopolistic control.17 Observing the 'gene rush', [NGOs predict that in
less than 25 years, much of the 'genetic commons' -- the legacy of
millions of years of biological and cultural evolution -- will have been
isolated, identified and enclosed in the form of intellectual property,
controlled, for the most part, by a handful of biotechnological
corporations without frontiers]{.underline} (or scruples) like Monsanto,
Novartis, Du Pont or Aventis. What is seen as intellec- tual property is
often, as Vandana Shiva says in her critical analysis of property
rights, TRIPs and patents, 'information "pirated" from non- western
societies and indigenous communities' (Shiva, 2001: 33).∂ [Moving from
the molecular to the molar body, we can now pro- ceed with our analysis
of the colonization of life and further inspect the commodification of
the body and its parts.]{.underline}18 Enslavement, exploitation,
prostitution, body trafficking and other practices that reduce human
bodies to a pair of hands, a pair of breasts, or a vagina are only some
examples of the commodification of the body that precede the systematic
objectification, fragmentation, modification and commodification of the
body by modern medicine. **[Driven by a highly technocratic ethos, the
medical sciences drive out the common sense conceptions of the body as a
unitary object, as something that we 'are' rather than as something that
we 'have'.]{.underline}** [Abstracting the body from the human being
that is embodied]{.underline} (dualism of body and mind), [as well as
from the other human beings]{.underline} (individualism) [and the cosmos
to which it was once intimately tied through a cascade of
homologies]{.underline} (disenchantment of the world), **[the medical
sciences consider the body as something that exists in itself and
functions like a machine]{.underline}**, or, to quote Descartes, like a
'watch composed of wheels and counterweights' (Le Breton, 1990: 61--82,
see also Leder, 1992). Objectivating the body by means of sophisticated
visual techniques (such as X-rays, sonography, endoscopy, magnetic
resonance imaging) that render the body transparent and thus also
permeable, [the medical sciences increasingly conceive the body as an
array of parts, organs and tissues that can be repaired or, if needed,
replaced by other parts, organs and tissues. **Like the global economy,
the body is now an open, complex, flexible machine, with spares and
parts available from the 'body shop'**]{.underline} (Kimbrell, 1993).∂
The market of transplants (organs, tissues, or fluids from other bodies,
living or dead) and implants (artificial organs or body parts made of
plastic, metal, nylon, or other synthetic materials) has led to the
frag- mentation of the body and the breaching of its boundaries. In an
inter- esting article on 'spare part surgery', Cecil Helman notes that
the body has been reconceptualized as a 'machine' (and machines
reconceptual- ized as 'people'): '[The body is now a collection of
"parts" or "pieces", for which "spares" are available when they finally
wear out']{.underline} (Helman, 1988: 15). **[Through transplants and
implants, the individual is permanently linked to the world of the
market, industry and science and trans- formed into a 'potential
prosthesis' for another individual]{.underline}** (Le Breton, 1990: 234;
1993: 296). Whereas the implants and prostheses are mass- produced by
the industry, the transplants and organs are available on the world
market19 -- or on the black market, as the bodies of innocents and poor
people are now raided once again by organized body snatchers with links
to the underworld.20∂ Through the implants of mass-produced heart
valves, pace-makers, artificial hip joints, prosthetic arms and legs,
and synthetic lenses, the patient becomes effectively a 'cyborg';
through the transplantation of mass-marketed hearts, kidneys, lungs,
lymph nodes, nerves, bone marrow and the infusion of blood and plasma,
she or he becomes -- like Franken- stein -- a living patchwork of
foreign bodies. [Through implants and transplants, the cybernetic
organisms become a living node in the medical network of commercial
relations between producers, suppliers, doctors and nurses.
']{.underline}Overall, it is the older members of this society who, as
they emerge from the workforce, will be reincorporated into the world of
industry through the ageing of the bodies' (Helman, 1988: 15). Ageing,
they become consumers of implants and transplants; sick, they become
cyborgs, attached to a complex array of machines that keep them alive;
dying, they become potential donors of organs. In all cases, [the bodies
have been invaded by the medical industry and linked to a complex,
evolving transnational network of corporate actors and commodified
actants]{.underline}.∂ **[The commodification of the human body
transforms the body into capital.]{.underline}** When the medical
industry proposes the patient a transplant or an implant, it modifies
and commodifies the body and transforms it into human capital. When the
bio-industry proposes genetic tests and promises genetic cures, it
speculates on life itself and accumulates capital within us. [While
posthumanists enthusiastically welcome the new bio-, cyber- and
nano-technologies that could modify our inherited genetics, physiology,
neurophysiology and neurochemistry, they forget the social relations in
which those technologies are embedded and avoid the problem of capital
in their grandiose projections of humanity]{.underline}. 'Capital R us.'
Capital is within us and we are within capital. In this very specific
sense, we can indeed say with Rikowski (2003: 143) that 'we are already
transhuman as a life-form within the social universe of capital: We are
capital, human capital, humanity capitalized'.∂ Although capitalism
tends to invade the totality of existence, one should not conclude all
too fast, however, that reification has become total, that everything is
commodified, and that there is no way out. If capital is already in us,
then the class struggle can be waged in us and the body becomes the site
of resistance and struggle. Even if our body has been objectivated as a
material anatomo-physiological body (Körper) among bodies, the fact
remains that for the time being, we still experi- ence our body as a
living body (Leib), that is, to use the phenomeno- logical terms of
Marcel, Plessner and Merleau-Ponty, as something that we are and not
only a something that we have. [Although we are always already caught in
the tentacles of an integrated and integrating machinic capitalism, the
omnipresence of commodification does not mean that in our everyday life,
we have become mere appendices of the capitalist megamachine and thus,
so to say, executors of our own life.]{.underline} In spite of
everything and for the time being, we remain human. We communicate,
empathize, rationalize, moralize and criticize. To avoid the totalizing
closure of its critical analysis of the processes of reification,
commodi- fication and alienation, a critical theory of contemporary
society has to take those anthropological constants into account. Having
presented elsewhere a metacritical analysis of critical theory
(Vandenberghe, 1997--8), I am only too aware that a critique of
domination presupposes a theory of emancipation to be effective. Yet, if
I have insisted in this article on the colonizing and totalizing logic
of capitalism, it is to flag the danger involved and in the hope of
contributing thereby to an active critique of and a passive resistance
to the imperial tendencies of the neo-capitalist system. There is hope.
While capital goes transnational, resistance is globalizing as well.
From Chiappas to Seattle and Bombay to Porto Allegre, the resistance
against universal commodification is gathering momentum. All over the
place, people are resisting the new world order that is emerging and are
screaming for global justice. Naomi Klein (2001: 82), the Canadian
activist and spokesperson of the anti-globalization movement, bears
testimony to the dispersed actions of the multitude:∂ Thousands of
groups today are all working against forces whose common threat is what
might broadly be described as the privatization of every aspect of life,
and the transformation of every activity and value into a commodity. . .
. American students are kicking ads out of the classroom. European
environmentalists and ravers are throwing parties at busy inter-
sections. Landless Thai peasants are planting organic vegetables on
over- irrigated golf courses. Bolivian workers are reversing the
privatization of water supply. . . . Typically these anti-privatization
campaigns get under way on their own. But they also periodically
converge -- that's what happened in Seattle, Prague, Washington, Davos,
Porto Allegre and Quebec.∂ In all its extraordinary and contradictory
diversity, the anti-globalization movement unifies the different new
social movements of the last century (anti-capitalist, anarchist,
ecopax, feminist, gay and lesbian, etc.) into a single social movement
that counterfactually represents humanity and defends the general
interest through advocacy. As such, it can be considered as the
legitimate heir of the working-class movement of the 19th century. When
activists and citizens manifest in the streets to protest and contest
the hegemonic project of the leaders of the world, the spirit of the
world manifests itself once again. Another world is possible . . .

#### Global capitalism neutralizes queer demands in order to absorb and neutralize the identity category -- attempts to call for rights within this system of capitalism leads only to exploitation 

**Zizek,** Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies,
Ljubljana **1999** Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 225-226

In so far as normative heterosexuality stands for the global Order
within which each sex is assigned its proper place, queer demands are
not simply demands that their sexual practice and lifestyle be
recognized in their specificity, alongside other practices, but
something that unsettles the very global order and its exclusionary
hierarchical logic; precisely as such, as \'out of joint\' with regard
to the existing order, queers stand for the dimension of Universality
(or, rather, can stand for it, since politicization is never directly
inscribed into one\'s objective social position, but involves the
gesture of subjectivization). Judith Butler 52 develops a powerful
argu­ment against the abstract and politically regressive opposition
between economic struggle and the \'merely cultural\' queer struggle for
recog­nition: far from being \'merely cultural\', the social form of
sexual repro­duction inhabits the very core of the social relations of
production; that is, the nuclear heterosexual family is a key component
and condition of the capitalist relations of ownership, exchange, and so
on; for that reason, the way queer political practice questions and
undermines normative heterosexuality poses a potential threat to the
capitalist mode of produc­tion itself. . . . My reaction to this thesis
is twofold: I fully endorse queer politics in so far as it
\'metaphoricizes\' its specific struggle as something that - if its
objectives were to be realized - undermines the very potentials of
capitalism. However, I tend to think that, [in the course of the ongoing
transformation into the 'post- political\' tolerant multiculturalist
regime, today \'s capitalist system is able to neutralize queer demands,
to absorb them as a specific \'way of life\'. Is not the history of
capitalism a long history of how the predominant ideologico-political
framework was able to accommodate (and soften the subversive edge of)
the movements and demands that seemed to threaten its very survival? For
a long time, sexual libertarians thought that monogamous sexual
repression was necessary for the survival of capitalism - now we know
that capitalism can not only tolerate, but even actively incite and
exploit, forms of \'perverse\' sexuality, not to mention promiscuous
indulgence in sexual pleasures. What if the same destiny awaits queer
demands? 53 The recent proliferation of differ­ent sexual practices and
identities]{.underline} (from sadomasochism to bisexuality and drag
performances), [far from posing a threat to the present regime of
biopower]{.underline} (to use the Foucauldian terms), [is precisely the
form Of sexuality that is generated by the present conditions of global
capitalism, which clearly favour the mode of subjectivity characterized
by multiple shifting identifications.]{.underline}

#### They get coopted as capitalism's new smokescreen

**[Hennessy 95]{.underline}** (Rosemary, Professor of English and
Director of the Center for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality at
Rice University, Queer Visibility in Commodity Culture, Cultural
Critique, No. 29 (Winter, 1994-1995), pp. 31-76)

But **[the new degree of homosexual visibility]{.underline}** in the
United States **[and the very existence of a queer counterdiscourse also
need to be considered critically in relation to capital\'s insidious and
relentless expansion. Not only is much recent gay visibility aimed at
producing new and potentially lucrative markets, but as in most
marketing strategies, money, not liberation, is the bottom
line]{.underline}**.2 In her analysis of the commodification of
lesbians, Danae Clark has observed that **[the intensified marketing of
lesbian images is less indicative of a growing acceptance of
homosexuality than of capitalism\'s appropriation of gay \"styles\" for
mainstream audiences. Visibility in commodity culture is in this sense a
limited victory for gays who are welcome to be visible as consumer
subjects but not as social subjects. The increasing circulation of gay
and lesbian images in consumer culture has the effect of consolidating
an imaginary, class-specific gay subjectivity for both straight and gay
audiences. This process]{.underline}** is not limited to the spheres of
knowledge promoted by popular culture and retail advertising but **[also
infiltrates the production of subjectivities in academic and activist
work]{.underline}**.

#### The aff's discussion of heteronormativity re-entrenches sexuality norms which hold up the structure of capitalism 

**McNamara, 2k** (Liam, academic and philosopher of queer theory, "The
Political Economy of Sex" "Profit and Pleasure: Sexual Identities in
Late Capitalism," Culture Machine, Reviews, Rosemary Hennessey,
http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/rt/printerFriendly/229/210)\--CRG

In Chapter Three, Hennessey [[attacks the current reigning ideology of
neoliberalism]{.mark}, which involves an increasing drive for profits,
globalization, and a general cultural turn in theory, [lead]{.mark}ing
[to the assimilation of critical theory by the
academy]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[This has lead to the abandonment of
Marxism and its substitution by cultural
materialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Hennessey tries to turn the argument
back to theories of exploitation, ultimately rejecting overdetermination
in favour of commodity fetishism. She explicitly [[links
heteronormativity to the emergence of the commodity form, since it is
the division of labour that]{.mark} has [allowed]{.mark} [the formation
of new sexual subjectivities]{.mark} in the consumer
society]{.underline}. This liberation of productive forces has enabled
the emergence of new desiring subjects that escape the heterosexual
norm, but this development is underpinned by a new patriarchal hierarchy
ushering in a renascent form of heteronormativity. Hennessey points out
how in the nineteenth century sexology and psychoanalytic discourses
allowed for new divergent sexual identities that were swiftly
reterritorialized under the \'perversions\'. [Heteronormative paradigms
have gone on to manage desire by restricting queer desire to the
perversions]{.underline}. Basically Hennessey is trying to historicize
Cixous\' ideas of a \'patriarchal binary logic\' and the persistence of
gendered active/passive roles of sexuality.6 Hennessey [[links sexual
liberation to economic imperatives]{.mark} and the division of labour in
addition to the conventional cultural explanations, and [suggests that
desire has been managed and moved away from procreative norms due
to]{.mark} the demands of the [new productive forces found in mass
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hennessey\'s stance shows a critical
understanding of sexual liberation, by the introduction of the theory of
class. Hennessey points out: \'capitalism does not require
heteronormative families or even a gendered division of labour. What it
does require is an unequal division of labour\' (P&P, 105). [[Some gay
men have adopted the ideology of the famil]{.underline}y]{.mark}, but
this ideology is generally compulsory for the disadvantaged. At bottom,
what is needed is commodity exchange and surplus value for the few not
many. **[[Capitalism still relies on heterosexuality for the
poor]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the new non-normative forms of
sexuality are generally reserved for the affluent consumer
subjectivities. [These [emergent \'postmodern sexualities\' are
compatible with the new liquescent forms of the commodity]{.mark},
possessing a fluidity that has an affinity with the new consumer
ethos.]{.underline}

### L/RC -- Globalized Militarism

#### The US' hegemonic agenda makes neoliberal violence inevitable and justifies global militarism resulting in endless wars and preventing any effective policy action.

**Chossudovsky, 16** \[professor emeritus of economics at the University
of Ottawa and the president and director of the Centre for Research on
Globalization, Neoliberalism and The Globalization of War. America's
Hegemonic Project,
<https://www.globalresearch.ca/neoliberalism-and-the-globalization-of-war-americas-hegemonic-project/5531125>,
6/16/16\] -TB

The world is at a dangerous crossroads. [**The United States and its
allies have launched a military adventure, which threatens the future of
humanity.** Major military and covert intelligence operations are being
undertaken simultaneously in the Middle East, Eastern Europe,
sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia and the Far East. The US-NATO military
agenda combines both major theater operations as well as covert actions
geared towards destabilizing sovereign states. **America's hegemonic
project is to destabilize and destroy countries through acts of war,
covert operations in support of terrorist organizations, regime change
and economic warfare.**]{.underline} [The latter includes the imposition
of deadly **macro-economic reforms on indebted countries as well the
manipulation of financial markets, the engineered collapse of national
currencies, the privatization of State property, the imposition of
economic sanctions, the triggering of inflation and black
markets.**]{.underline} The economic dimensions of this military agenda
must be clearly understood. **[War and Globalization are intimately
related.]{.underline}** [These military and intelligence operations are
implemented alongside a process of economic and political
destabilization targeting specific countries in all major regions of
World. **Neoliberalism is an integral part of this foreign policy
agenda. It constitutes an all-encompassing mechanism of economic
destabilization**. Since the 1997 Asian crisis, the IMF-World Bank
structural adjustment program (SAP) has evolved towards a broader
framework, which consists in ultimately undermining national
governments' ability to formulate and implement national economic and
social policies.]{.underline} In turn, [the demise of national
sovereignty was also facilitated by the instatement of the World Trade
Organization]{.underline} (WTO) in 1995, evolving towards the global
trading agreements (TTIP and TPP) which (if adopted) would essentially
transfer state policy entirely into the hands of corporations. [In
recent years, neoliberalism has extended its grip from the so-called
developing countries to the developed countries of both Eastern and
Western Europe.]{.underline} Bankruptcy programs have been set in
motion. Island, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, etc, have been the target of
sweeping austerity measures coupled with the privatization of key
sectors of the national economy. [The global economic crisis is
intimately related to America's hegemonic agenda. In the US and the EU,
a spiraling defense budget backlashes on the civilian sectors of
economic activity. **"War is Good for Business": the powerful financial
groups which routinely manipulate stock markets, currency and commodity
markets, are also promoting the continuation and escalation of the
Middle East war.**]{.underline} A worldwide process of impoverishment is
an integral part of the New World Order agenda. Beyond the Globalization
of Poverty Historically, impoverishment of large sectors of the World
population has been engineered through the imposition of IMF-style
macro-economic reforms. Yet, in the course of the last 15 years, a new
destructive phase has been set in motion. [**The World has moved beyond
the "globalization of poverty": countries are transformed in open
territories,** State institutions collapse, schools and hospitals are
closed down, the legal system disintegrates, borders are redefined,
broad sectors of economic activity including agriculture and
manufacturing are precipitated into bankruptcy**, all of which
ultimately leads to a process of social collapse, exclusion and
destruction of human life including the outbreak of famines, the
displacement of entire populations**]{.underline} (refugee crisis). This
"second stage" goes beyond the process of impoverishment instigated in
the early 1980s by creditors and international financial institutions.
In this regard, mass poverty resulting from macro-economic reform sets
the stage of a process of outright destruction of human life. In turn,
under conditions of widespread unemployment, the costs of labor in
developing countries has plummeted. The driving force of the global
economy is luxury consumption and the weapons industry. The New World
Order [Broadly speaking, the main corporate actors of the New World
Order]{.underline} are • Wall Street and the Western banking
conglomerates including its offshore money laundering facilities, tax
havens, hedge funds and secret accounts, • **[The Military Industrial
Complex regrouping major "defense contractors", security and mercenary
companies, intelligence outfits, on contract to the
Pentagon;]{.underline}** • The Anglo-American Oil and Energy Giants, •
The Biotech Conglomerates, which increasingly control agriculture and
the food chain; • Big Pharma, • The Communication Giants and Media
conglomerates, which constitute the propaganda arm of the New World
Order. There is of course overlap, between Big Pharma and the Weapons
industry, the oil conglomerates and Wall Street, etc. These various
corporate entities interact with government bodies, international
financial institutions, and US intelligence. [The state structure has
evolved towards what Peter Dale Scott calls the "Deep State", integrated
by covert intelligence bodies, think tanks, secret councils and
consultative bodies, where important New World Order decisions are
ultimately reached on behalf of powerful corporate
interests.]{.underline} In turn, intelligence operatives increasingly
permeate the United Nations including its specialized agencies,
nongovernmental organizations, trade unions, and political parties. What
this means is that the executive and legislature constitute a
smokescreen, a mechanism for providing political legitimacy to decisions
taken by the corporate establishment behind closed doors. Media
Propaganda The corporate media, which constitutes the propaganda arm of
the New World Order, has a long history whereby intelligence ops oversee
the news chain. In turn, the corporate media serves the useful purpose
of obfuscating war crimes, of presenting a humanitarian narrative which
upholds the legitimacy of politicians in high office. Acts of war and
economic destabilization are granted legitimacy. War is presented as a
peace-keeping undertaking. Both the global economy as well as the
political fabric of Western capitalism have become criminalized. The
judicial apparatus at a national level as well the various international
human rights tribunals and criminal courts serve the useful function of
upholding the legitimacy of US-NATO led wars and human rights
violations. Destabilizing Competing Poles of Capitalist Development
There are of course significant divisions and capitalist rivalry within
the corporate establishment. In the post Cold War era, the US hegemonic
project consists in destabilizing competing poles of capitalist
development including China, Russia and Iran as well as countries such
as India, Brazil and Argentina. In recent developments, the US has also
exerted pressure on the capitalist structures of the member states of
the European Union. Washington exerts influence in the election of heads
of State including Germany and France, which are increasingly aligned
with Washington. The monetary dimensions are crucial. The international
financial system established under Bretton Woods prevails. The global
financial apparatus is dollarized. [The powers of money creation are
used as a mechanism to appropriate real economy assets. Speculative
financial trade has become an instrument of enrichment at the expense of
the real economy.]{.underline} Excess corporate profits and
multibillion-dollar speculative earnings (deposited in tax free
corporate charities) are also recycled towards the corporate control of
politicians, civil society organizations, not to mention scientists and
intellectuals. It's called corruption, co-optation, and fraud. Latin
America: The Transition towards a "Democratic Dictatorship" [In Latin
America, the military dictatorships of the 1960s and 1970s have in large
part been replaced by US proxy regimes, i.e. a democratic dictatorship
has been installed which ensures continuity.]{.underline} At the same
time the ruling elites in Latin America have remoulded. They have become
increasingly integrated into the logic of global capitalism, requiring
an acceptance of the US hegemonic project. **[Macro-economic reform has
been conducive to the impoverishment of the entire Latin america
region.]{.underline}** In the course of the last 40 years,
impoverishment has been triggered by hyperinflation, starting with the
1973 military coup in Chile and the devastating reforms of the 1980s and
early 1990s. The implementation of these deadly economic reforms
including sweeping privatization, trade deregulation, etc. is
coordinated in liaison with US intelligence ops, including the "Dirty
war" and Operation Condor, the Contra insurrection in Nicaragua, etc.
The development of a new and privileged elite integrated into the
structures of Western investment and consumerism has emerged. Regime
change has been launched against a number of Latin American countries.
**[Any attempt to introduce reforms which departs from the neoliberal
consensus is the object of "dirty tricks" including acts of
infiltration, smear campaigns, political assassinations, interference in
national elections and covert operations to foment social
divisions.]{.underline}** This process inevitably requires corruption
and cooptation at the highest levels of government as well as within the
corporate and financial establishment. In some countries of the region

#### The arms trade cycle creates endless opportunities for the military industrial base to profit from war and capitalize off security dilemmas that open the door for greater conflicts

**Rufanges, 15** \[Professor of conflict analysis and defense economics

Oberta de Catalunya, Researcher of defense economics, peace and
disarmament at the Centre of Peace Studies Delàs. Board member of the
International Peace Bureau, War profiteering: the neoliberal militarism,

**[War profiteering is explained with the military economy cycle which
is based]{.underline}** - as is most sectors of the economy - **[on
neoliberal logic, the free market, privatization and reduction of
regulations.]{.underline}** It causes attitudes strictly related to
personal enrichment and maximizing the economic benefit in the defense
industry, forming the so-called neoliberal militarism. [Moreover war
profiteering goes beyond arms and defense sector. War needs lots of
resources, not only weapons and armies, also logistics, transport, food,
cleaning, translation services and private security.]{.underline} There
are also wars for greed, which is not only power but also resources:
oil, coltan, diamonds and whatever can be bought and sold in a market.
Economic profits are part of war and wars are also made for profit.
Framework of war profiteering: the military economic cycle [The military
economic cycle responds to an economic view of defense economics, also
referred to as the \'arms cycle\'. In any case both names refer to the
cycle that describes the route that weapons production takes, from the
decision to take military public budget to cover the alleged need for
weapons to their final use. The real beginning of the cycle starts in
the arguments and discourses that legitimize the need for arms and
armies depending on the identification of threats to a country\'s
security and defense to justify high levels of militarization and
armaments.]{.underline} Thus, [**security doctrines developed by
governments** - directly influenced by research defense, security,
conflict and peace centers, popularly known as think tanks - **establish
a certain level of armaments and militarization development of a given
society.**]{.underline} Besides the occasional or permanent influence of
think tanks on the policies of a country, [the need to maintain armed
forces depends on the culture of defense, militarized education,
military and arms history and tradition, and tolerance for weapons in a
society. We also have to consider the role of civil society and the fact
that social movements may also determine levels of armaments and
militarism.]{.underline} The assumption of the need for maintaining
armed forces opens the way to a political decision strictly related to
the military or arms economic cycle, decisions on the military budget
that appoints certain measures to objectives of discourses, doctrines
and other views on the defense needs of a country. Military spending
includes research and development (military R&D) of new weapons and
their production in the defense industry, which is financed partly by
public budget. Hence, [when it comes to military spending, military R&D,
companies and military industries and arms purchases, we have to pay
attention not only to the defense budgets of the states, but also to
budgets of other ministries such as industry.]{.underline} Together they
finance the whole military business cycle. The other elements that form
a part of the cycle are the arms trade, which also includes financial
institutions that hold the entire cycle, as well as shareholders of
military enterprises that finance the industry operations and the arms
trade. The active role of the military-industrial complex in war
profiteering The "military-industrial complex" term came into use in
Eisenhower\'s farewell speech as US president in 1961. He used this term
to refer to the lobbyists with the most influence in the White House.
**[The so-called military-industrial complex is made up of the set of
people and business and political organizations, including senior
military officers of the departments or ministries of defense, who have
the desire to influence decisions on military policy, including
armaments purchases.]{.underline}** A number of companies as well as
many people including politicians and government departments related to
military enterprises are involved in this so-called military-industrial
complex, that can range from the defense industry to Interior, and
Foreign Trade. [On the level of administration, they form a part of the
military-industrial complex, the high command of the armed forces, many
of which have close ties to the arms industry and apply pressure to
observe an increase in their weapons and equipment arsenals and thus,
the ability to influence national and international policy. When it
comes to the role of political office that has some defense
responsibilities, a member of the armed forces or the military industry
executive (sometimes being the same person), the revolving door
phenomenon occurs in the defense sector. **The military economic cycle
can generate political and economic dynamics that put a country and
economy in an ideal state for those who take advantage of this cycle in
which defense economics converts into a permanent economy of
war.**]{.underline} It's important to analyze it to understand the
military economic cycle as such: military spending, arms industries,
exports and financing. **[Companies and individuals who are active in
the military economic cycle comprise the military-industrial complex,
which profits the most from war.]{.underline}**

### ! -- Alt Right 

#### Capitalism brings rise to right-winged forces that justify racist and xenophobic policies as reactionary

[The systemic crisis of neoliberal capitalism is not only
economic]{.underline} and ecological in nature, as is manifest in the
explosive growth in global economic and ecological inequalities,
[but]{.underline} is also witnessed [as a growing crisis of legitimacy
for traditional political parties and ruling power
structures]{.underline} that have long controlled the system. The
political manifestations of this crisis can be seen everywhere,
especially in the United States with the election of Donald Trump to the
Presidency (Faber et al. 2017 Faber, Daniel, Jennie Stephens, Victor
Wallis, Roger Gottlieb, Charles Levenstein, and Patrick CoatarPeter, and
Boston Editorial Group of CNS. 2017. "Trump's Electoral Triumph: Class,
Race, Gender and the Hegemony of the Polluter-Industrial Complex."
Capitalism Nature Socialism 28 (1): 1--15. doi:
10.1080/10455752.2017.1279867 \[Taylor & Francis Online\], , \[Google

authoritarian**]{.underline} [and proto-fascist]{.underline}
[**forces**]{.underline} in Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific; [the
growing power of racist, anti-immigrant parties]{.underline} in Italy,
and northern and east-central Europe; and the weakening legitimacy of
European labor and social democratic parties (and the challenges to the
European Union itself, as seen in UK's Brexit). [The larger, system-wide
crisis of global capitalism is spawning a new subjective political voice
in the form of reactionary populism]{.underline}. Termed xenophobic
authoritarianism by Inglehart and Norris, [**reactionary populism
discourse** typically]{.underline} [favors mono-culturalism over
multiculturalism]{.underline}, [national self-interest over
international cooperation]{.underline} and development aid, closed
borders over the free flow of people, ideas, labor and capital, [and
traditionalism over progressive and liberal social values.]{.underline}
[Hence Trump's rhetoric]{.underline} seeks [to stir up a potent mix of
racial resentment, **intolerance**]{.underline} of multiculturalism,
nationalistic isolationism, nostalgia for past glories, mistrust of
outsiders, traditional misogyny and sexism, [the appeal of forceful
strong-man **leadership**]{.underline}, attack-dog politics, and racial
and anti-Muslim animus. (Inglehart and Norris 2016 Inglehart, Ronald F.,

ascendancy of an even more hard-nosed brand of capitalism. The rise of
rightwing populism is a response to the failures of what Nancy Ingehart

\[Google Scholar\] ) terms "progressive" neoliberalism to provide
adequate economic security to broad swaths of the world's working and
middle classes. In the United States progressive neoliberalism was
predicated in good part on an uneasy alliance between Wall Street, the
Democratic Party, and many of the more mainstream organizations within
new social movements working on feminism, environmentalism,
multiculturalism, antiracism, and LGBTQIA issues. [This]{.underline}
uneasy [alliance revolved]{.underline} [around an economic agenda
for]{.underline} the [deregulation]{.underline} of the banks and
financialization of the economy, free trade agreements, a rollback of
the welfare state and some environmental measures, [and the projection
of U.S. military power]{.underline} abroad. Both the Clinton and Obama
administrations famously co-opted mainstream environmentalists and
engaged in preemptive "containment" of costly and far-reaching
environmental policy proposals. Both administrations sought
accommodation with the environmental and environmental justice (EJ)
movements by allowing limited victories in specific instances of
high-profile public mobilization. In exchange the polluter-industrial
complex would be rewarded with weaker regulations, generous subsidies
and access to energy and other natural resources on federal lands, and
other forms of economic compensation. These concessions to industry
often came at the expense of other battles being waged by grassroots
environmental organizations around the country.

### ! -- Racism 

#### Economic racism is central to capitalism -- it facilitates minorities being disproportionately affected by climate change

In this light, [environmental injustices are **rooted in power
structures** **and** models of **capital accumulation** that confer
social class advantages and racial/gender privileges]{.underline}
(Sicotte 2016 Sicotte, Diane. 2016. From Workshop to Waste Magnet:
Environmental Inequality in the Philadelphia Region. New Brunswick, NJ:
Rutgers University Press. \[Google Scholar\] , 13). And [when analyzing
environmental inequality]{.underline}, we should be aware that [there
are multiple political-economic forces at work]{.underline} that give
the injustice a particular context and form (Holifield 2001 Holifield,
Ryan. 2001. "Defining Environmental Justice and Environmental Racism."
Urban Geography 22 (1): 78--90. doi: 10.2747/0272-3638.22.1.78 .
\[Taylor & Francis Online\], \[Web of Science ®\], , \[Google Scholar\]
). In the United States and the world [**economy racism is a
"constituent logic" of capitalism**]{.underline} and, as stated by
Pulido, "creates a variegated landscape that cultures and capital can
exploit to create enhanced power and profits" (Pulido 2016 Pulido,
Laura. 2016. "Flint, Environmental Racism, and Racial Capitalism."
Capitalism Nature Socialism 27 (3): 1--16. doi:
10.1080/10455752.2016.1213013 . \[Taylor & Francis Online\], , \[Google

10.1080/10455752.2016.1206583 . \[Taylor & Francis Online\], , \[Google
Scholar\] ). As we shall see, [environmental racism facilitates capital
accumulation]{.underline} in a variety of critically important ways,
[and is central to the reactionary neoliberal project]{.underline}. As a
result, [poorer people of color face a "quadruple exposure effect" to
environmental health hazards.]{.underline} This first takes the form of
higher rates of "on the job" exposure to dangerous substances used in
the production process inside the factory; and the second consists in
greater exposure to toxic pollutants in the community outside the
factory (Morello-Froch 1997 Morello-Froch, Rachel. 1997. "Environmental
Justice and California's 'Riskscape': The distribution of Air Toxics and
Associated Cancer and Non-Cancer Health Risks among Diverse Community."
PhD diss., School of Public Health, Environmental Health Sciences
Division, University of California at Berkeley. [). Faulty cleanup
efforts implemented by the government]{.underline} or the waste
treatment industry often [magnify these problems]{.underline} (Lavelle
and Coyle 1992 Lavelle, Marianne, and Marcia Coyle. 1992. "Unequal
Protection: The Racial Divide in Environmental Law." National Law
Journal 21: 2--12. ; O'Neil 2005 O'Neil, Sandra G. 2005. "Environmental
Justice in the Superfund Clean-up Process," PhD Diss., Department of
Sociology, Boston College. ). [Poorer communities, women, and people of
color also face **greater dislocation**]{.underline}, **[health
problems, and loss of livelihood]{.underline}** [as a result of energy
and natural resource extraction]{.underline} (Martinez-Alier 2002
Martinez-Alier, Joan. 2002. The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of
Ecological Conflicts and Valuation. Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar.
\[Crossref\], , ; Bell 2013 Bell, Shannon. 2013. Our Roots Run as Deep
as Ironweed: Appalachian Women and the Fight for Environmental Justice.
Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press. ). The final piece to the
quadruple exposure effect comes in the form of greater exposure to toxic
chemicals in the household, commercial foods, and a variety of consumer
products. As demonstrated in the case of Flint, Michigan, [neoliberal
policy cost-cutting measures continue to be a leading health threat to
children]{.underline}, particularly poor children and children of color
living in older, dilapidated housing with lead pipes (Pulido 2016
Pulido, Laura. 2016. "Flint, Environmental Racism, and Racial
Capitalism." Capitalism Nature Socialism 27 (3): 1--16. doi:
10.1080/10455752.2016.1213013 . \[Taylor & Francis Online\], , ). [Black
children are now five times more likely]{.underline} than white
[children to have lead poisoning]{.underline}. Taken together, it is
clear that racial capitalism is causing people of color to experience a
disparate exposure to environmental hazards where they "work, live, and
play" (Alston 1990 Alston, Dana. 1990. We Speak for Ourselves: Social
Justice, Race, and Environment. Washington, DC: The Panos Institute.)
Below I will quickly sketch out five [processes by which reactionary
neoliberal capitalism is likely to exacerbate environmental
injustices]{.underline} in the United States: (1) [by further promoting
the mobility of]{.underline} ecologically [hazardous industries into
communities of color]{.underline} and white working-class neighborhoods;
(2) [by restricting the ability]{.underline} of the subaltern [to move
out of dangerous areas]{.underline} for safer neighborhoods; (3) by
facilitating the dislocation of the subaltern from ecologically
revitalized communities; (4) [by limiting the ability of workers of
color to leave dangerous jobs]{.underline} for safer occupations; and
(5) [by facilitating the appropriation of land and resources by global
capital in a manner detrimental to the subaltern and popular class
formations]{.underline}. Although my focus here is on the United States,
it should be remembered that environmental injustices are being
displaced in a very similar manner onto disempowered communities in
neoliberal nations across the globe.

A white man posts an ad on Craigslist explaining that he wants to make
black friends.2 A political figure accused of racial indifference
casually refers to a black friend while addressing the NAACP.3 Ad
ministrators at a predominantly white university, concerned that pro
spective students will be deterred by the school\'s racial homogeneity,
authorize the use of Photoshop to add a black student to the photo on
the cover of the university\'s application brochure.4 A predominantly
white company, facing an array of lawsuits alleging race discrimina
tion,5 [aggressively recruits and hires nonwhite employees in order to
create a track record of minority representation]{.underline}.6 Each of
these incidents involves what I will call [racial capitalism --- the
process of deriving social or economic value from the racial identity of
another person.7 A person of any race might engage in racial
capitalism]{.underline}, as might an institution dominated by any racial
group. But in this Article, my focus is on the version of racial
capitalism [in which a white individual or a predominantly white
institution derives social or economic value from associating with
individuals with nonwhite racial identities. Such racial capitalism is
common. In a society preoccupied with diversity, nonwhiteness is a
valued commodity. And where that society is founded on
capitalism,]{.underline} it is un surprising that the commodity of
nonwhiteness is exploited for its market value. This Article is the
first to identify racial capitalism as a systemic phenomenon and the
first to describe the way that [white people and predominantly white
institutions derive value from nonwhiteness]{.underline}. Of course,
assigning value to race is nothing new in America. Whiteness has been a
source of value throughout our history, conferring power and privilege
on the possessor. For centuries, American courts explicitly recognized
the value of whiteness --- for example, numerous courts held that
calling a white person \"black\" constituted defamation and therefore
qualified for legal redress.10 Litigants have also acknowledged the
value of whiteness --- for example, in Plessy v. Ferguson,n Homer Plessy
referred to [the perception of his whiteness as the \"most valuable sort
of property]{.underline}. . . the master-key that unlocks the golden
door of opportunity.\"12 And scholars have examined the value of
whiteness --- for example, Cheryl Harris\'s acclaimed work Whiteness as
Property posits that whiteness is a kind of \"status property\" that can
be both analogized to conventional forms of property and literally
converted to those forms.1 Nonwhiteness has been valued differently and
more ambiguously. [The practice of using nonwhiteness as a justification
for the commodification of nonwhite individuals is older than America
itself, as our bitter history of slavery demonstrates]{.underline}. For
centuries, nonwhiteness was used as a basis for withholding value by
denying nonwhite people legal rights and privileges. More recently,
however, [nonwhiteness has been considered a source of
value;]{.underline} decisions such as Regents of the University of
California v. Bakke14 and Grutter v. Bollinger15 have validated
affirmative action programs in the interest of fostering racial
diversity in colleges and universities. This rationale both reflects and
reifies the premium that privileged segments of American society place
upon diversity, both within and beyond institutions of higher education.
In part as a result of judicial action, nonwhiteness has acquired a new
sort of value. We have internalized the idea that racial diversity is a
social good, and as a result, we assign value to the inclusion of
nonwhite individuals in our social milieu, our educational institutions,
and our workplaces. [Nonwhiteness has therefore become something
desirable --- and for many, it has become a commodity to be pursued,
captured, possessed, and used]{.underline}. To be clear, I see [nothing
inherently problematic in encouraging racial diversity within social
groups and formal institution]{.underline}s, and I am convinced that
such diversity is a necessary prerequisite to improving racial relations
in America. The efforts of colleges and universities, employers, and
other institutions to promote racial diversity should be celebrated, not
disparaged. But [problems with racial capitalism arise when white
individuals and predominantly white institutions seek and achieve racial
diversity without examining their motives and practices]{.underline}.
Striving for numerical diversity, without more, results in awareness of
nonwhiteness only in its thinnest form --- as a bare marker of
difference and a signal of presence. [This superficial view of diversity
con sequently leads white individuals and predominantly white
institutions to treat nonwhiteness as a prized commodity rather than as
a cherished and personal manifestation of identity]{.underline}.
Affiliation with nonwhite individuals thus becomes merely a useful means
for white individuals and predominantly white institutions to acquire
social and economic benefits while deflecting potential charges of
racism and avoiding more difficult questions of racial equality. This
instrumental view is antithetical to a view of nonwhiteness --- and race
more generally --- as a personal characteristic intrinsically deserving
of respect. Worse still, the instrumental view of nonwhiteness inhibits
efforts at genuine racial inclusiveness and the irony, then, is that our
legal and social emphasis on diversity --- while intended to produce
progress toward a racially egalitarian society --- has instead in many
cases contributed to a state of affairs that [degrades nonwhiteness by
commodifying it]{.underline} and that relegates non white individuals to
the status of \"trophies\" or \"passive emblems.\"16 Racial capitalism
frequently does not benefit the nonwhite individuals whose identities
are the source of capital, nor does it necessarily benefit society as a
whole[. Racial capitalism is troubling on both a symbolic and a
practical level]{.underline}. When white people and predominantly white
institutions commodify nonwhiteness and exploit its value, even under
the auspices of a well-intentioned diversity rationale, racial
capitalism evokes one of the darkest eras in American history, during
which nonwhiteness --- and nonwhite human beings --- were assigned value
and transferred among white people as commodities. Racial capitalism
also forecloses progress on a practical level, both by inflicting
identity harms on nonwhite individuals and by displacing substantive
antidiscrimination reform. [We should therefore decline to engage in
racial capitalism and should instead decline to engage in racial
capitalism and should instead develop more meaningful mechanisms for
improving racial relations in America]{.underline}.

### ! -- EVERYTHING

#### Capitalism causes every impact---poverty, inequality, democratic decline, disease, climate change, women and worker exploitation, and nuclear war

**Foster 19** (John, PhD from York University, Professor at the

Failed---What Next?," Monthly Review, 2/1/19,

JLin)

Less than two decades into the twenty-first century, it is evident that
[capitalism has failed as a social system. The world is mired in
**economic stagnation, financialization, and the most extreme inequality
in human history,** accompanied by mass unemployment and
underemployment,]{.underline} precariousness, **[poverty, hunger, wasted
output and lives, and]{.underline}** what at this point can only be
called a planetary [**ecological "death spiral**."]{.underline}1 [The
digital revolution]{.underline}, the greatest technological advance of
our time, has [rapidly mutated]{.underline} from a promise of [free
communication and liberated production into **new means of surveillance,
control, and displacement** of the working population]{.underline}. The
institutions of **[liberal democracy are at the point of collapse, while
fascism]{.underline}**, the rear guard of the capitalist system, **[is
again on the march]{.underline}**, along with patriarchy, racism,
imperialism, and war. To say that [capitalism]{.underline} is a failed
system is not, of course, to suggest that its breakdown and
disintegration is imminent.2 It does, however, mean that it [has passed
from being a historically necessary and creative system at its inception
to being a historically unnecessary and destructive one in the present
century]{.underline}. Today, more than ever, [the world is faced with
the epochal choice between "the revolutionary reconstitution of society
at large and the common ruin of the contending classes.]{.underline}"3
Indications of this failure of capitalism are everywhere. [Stagnation of
investment punctuated by bubbles of financial expansion, which then
inevitably burst]{.underline}, now [characterizes the]{.underline}
so-called [free market.4 **Soaring inequality**]{.underline} in income
and wealth [has its counterpart in]{.underline} the [**declining
material circumstances of a majority of the population.** Real
wages]{.underline} for most workers in the United States [have barely
budged in forty years despite steadily rising
productivity]{.underline}.5 [Work intensity has increased, while work
and safety protections]{.underline} on the job [have been systematically
jettisoned]{.underline}. Unemployment data has become more and more
meaningless due to a [new institutionalized underemployment]{.underline}
in the form of [contract labor in the gig economy]{.underline}.6 [Unions
have been reduced to mere shadows]{.underline} of their former glory as
**[capitalism has asserted totalitarian control over
workplaces]{.underline}**. With the demise of Soviet-type societies,
social democracy in Europe has perished in the new atmosphere of
"liberated capitalism."7 The [capture of the surplus value **produced by
overexploited populations in the poorest regions** of the world, via the
global labor arbitrage instituted by multinational corporations, is
leading to]{.underline} an unprecedented amassing of financial wealth at
the center of the world economy and [relative poverty in the
periphery.]{.underline}8 Around \$21 trillion of offshore funds are
currently lodged in tax havens on islands mostly in the Caribbean,
constituting "the fortified refuge of Big Finance."9 Technologically
driven monopolies resulting from the global-communications revolution,
together with the rise to dominance of Wall Street-based financial
capital geared to speculative asset creation, have further contributed
to the riches of today's "1 percent." [Forty-two billionaires now enjoy
as much wealth as half the world's population,]{.underline} while the
three richest men in the United States---Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and
Warren Buffett---have more wealth than half the U.S. population.10 [**In
every region of the world, inequality has increased sharply in recent
decades**.]{.underline}11 The gap in per capita income and wealth
between the richest and poorest nations, which has been the dominant
trend for centuries, is rapidly widening once again.12 More than 60
percent of the world's employed population, some two billion people, now
work in the impoverished informal sector, forming a massive global
proletariat. The global reserve army of labor is some 70 percent larger
than the active labor army of formally employed workers.13 [Adequate
health care, housing, education, and clean water and air are
increasingly out of reach for large sections of the
population]{.underline}, even in wealthy countries in North America and
Europe, while [transportation is becoming more difficult]{.underline} in
the United States and many other countries due to irrationally high
levels of dependency on the automobile and disinvestment in public
transportation. [Urban structures are more and more characterized by
gentrification and segregation]{.underline}, with cities becoming the
playthings of the well-to-do while marginalized populations are shunted
aside. About half a million people, most of them children, are homeless
on any given night in the United States.14 New York City is experiencing
a major rat infestation, attributed to warming temperatures, mirroring
trends around the world.15 In the United States and other high-income
countries, [**life expectancy is in decline**, with a remarkable
resurgence of Victorian illnesses related to poverty and
exploitation]{.underline}. In Britain, gout, scarlet fever, whooping
cough, and even scurvy are now resurgent, along with tuberculosis. [With
inadequate enforcement of work health and safety regulations, black lung
disease has returned]{.underline} with a vengeance in U.S. coal
country.16 **[Overuse of antibiotics, particularly by capitalist
agribusiness, is leading to an antibiotic-resistance crisis, with the
dangerous growth of superbugs]{.underline}** generating increasing
numbers of deaths, which by mid--century could surpass annual cancer
deaths, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a "global
health emergency."17 These dire conditions, arising from the workings of
the system, are consistent with what Frederick Engels, in the Condition
of the Working Class in England, called "social murder."18 [At the
instigation of giant corporations]{.underline}, philanthrocapitalist
foundations, [and neoliberal governments, public education has been
restructured around corporate-designed testing]{.underline} based on the
implementation of robotic common-core standards. This is [generating
massive databases on the student population, much of which are now being
surreptitiously marketed and sold]{.underline}.19 The corporatization
and [privatization of education is feeding the progressive subordination
of children]{.underline}'s needs to the cash nexus of the commodity
market. We are thus seeing a dramatic return of Thomas Gradgrind's and
Mr. M'Choakumchild's crass utilitarian philosophy dramatized in Charles
Dickens's Hard Times: "Facts are alone wanted in life" and "You are
never to fancy."20 Having been reduced to intellectual dungeons, many of
the poorest, most racially segregated schools in the United States are
mere pipelines for prisons or the military.21 More than two million
people in the United States are behind bars, a higher rate of
incarceration than any other country in the world, constituting a new
Jim Crow. The total population in prison is nearly equal to the number
of people in Houston, Texas, the fourth largest U.S. city. African
Americans and Latinos make up 56 percent of those incarcerated, while
constituting only about 32 percent of the U.S. population. Nearly 50
percent of American adults, and a much higher percentage among African
Americans and Native Americans, have an immediate family member who has
spent or is currently spending time behind bars. Both black men and
Native American men in the United States are nearly three times,
Hispanic men nearly two times, more likely to die of police shootings
than white men.22 [Racial divides are now widening across the entire
planet.]{.underline} [**Violence against women and the expropriation of
their unpaid labor**,]{.underline} as well as the higher level of
exploitation of their paid labor, ar[e **integral to the way in which
power is organized in capitalist society**]{.underline}---and how it
seeks to divide rather than unify the population. More than a third of
women worldwide have experienced physical/sexual violence. [Women's
bodies, in particular, are **objectified, reified, and commodified as
part of the normal workings of monopoly-capitalist
marketing.**]{.underline}23 [The mass media-propaganda
system]{.underline}, part of the larger corporate matrix, [is now
merging into a social media-based propaganda system]{.underline} that is
more porous and seemingly anarchic, [but more universal and more than
ever favoring money and power]{.underline}. Utilizing modern marketing
and surveillance techniques, which now dominate all digital
interactions, vested interests are able to tailor their messages,
largely unchecked, to individuals and their social networks, creating
concerns about "fake news" on all sides.24 Numerous business entities
promising technological manipulation of voters in countries across the
world have now surfaced, auctioning off their services to the highest
bidders.25 The elimination of net neutrality in the United States means
further concentration, centralization, and control over the entire
Internet by monopolistic service providers. [**Elections are
increasingly prey to unregulated "dark money" emanating from the coffers
of corporations and the billionaire class**.]{.underline} Although
presenting itself as the world's leading democracy, the United States,
as Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy stated in Monopoly Capital in 1966, "is
democratic in form and plutocratic in content."26 In the [Trump
administration, following a long-established tradition, 72 percent of
those appointed to the cabinet have come from the higher corporate
echelons,]{.underline} while others have been drawn from the military.27
[War, engineered by the United States and other major powers at the apex
of the system, has become perpetual in strategic oil regions such as the
Middle East, **and threatens to escalate into a global thermonuclear
exchange**.]{.underline} During the Obama administration, the United
States was engaged in wars/bombings in seven different
countries---Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and
Pakistan.28 [Torture and assassinations have been reinstituted by
Washington as acceptable instruments of war]{.underline} against those
now innumerable individuals, group networks, and whole societies that
are branded as terrorist. A new Cold War and nuclear arms race is in the
making between the United States and Russia, while Washington is seeking
to place road blocks to the continued rise of China. The [Trump
administration has created a new space force as a separate branch of the
military in an attempt to ensure U.S. dominance in the militarization of
space]{.underline}. Sounding the alarm on the increasing dangers of a
nuclear war and of climate destabilization, the distinguished Bulletin
of Atomic Scientists moved its doomsday clock in 2018 to two minutes to
midnight, the closest since 1953, when it marked the advent of
thermonuclear weapons.29 Increasingly severe economic sanctions are
being imposed by the United States on countries like Venezuela and
Nicaragua, despite their democratic elections---or because of them.
Trade and currency wars are being actively promoted by core states,
while racist barriers against immigration continue to be erected in
Europe and the United States as some 60 million refugees and internally
displaced peoples flee devastated environments. Migrant populations
worldwide have risen to 250 million, with those residing in high-income
countries constituting more than 14 percent of the populations of those
countries, up from less than 10 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, ruling
circles and wealthy countries seek to wall off islands of power and
privilege from the mass of humanity, who are to be left to their fate.30
[More than three-quarters of a billion people]{.underline}, over 10
percent of the world population, [are chronically
malnourished.]{.underline}31 Food stress in the United States keeps
climbing, leading to the rapid growth of cheap dollar stores selling
poor quality and toxic food. Around forty million Americans,
representing one out of eight households, including nearly thirteen
million children, are food insecure.32 Subsistence farmers are being
pushed off their lands by agribusiness, private capital, and sovereign
wealth funds in a global depeasantization process that constitutes the
greatest movement of people in history.33 [Urban overcrowding and
poverty across much of the globe is so severe that one can now
reasonably refer to a "planet of slums]{.underline}."34 Meanwhile, the
world housing market is estimated to be worth up to \$163 trillion (as
compared to the value of gold mined over all recorded history, estimated
at \$7.5 trillion).35 [The Anthropocene epoch]{.underline}, first
ushered in by the Great Acceleration of the world economy immediately
after the Second World War, has generated enormous rifts in planetary
boundaries, [**extending from climate change to ocean acidification, to
the sixth extinction,** to disruption of the global nitrogen and
phosphorus cycles, to the loss of freshwater, to the disappearance of
forests, to **widespread toxic-chemical and radioactive
pollution**]{.underline}.36 It is now estimated that 60 percent of the
world's wildlife vertebrate population (including mammals, reptiles,
amphibians, birds, and fish) have been wiped out since 1970, while the
worldwide abundance of invertebrates has declined by 45 percent in
recent decades.37 What climatologist James Hansen calls the "species
exterminations" resulting from accelerating climate change and rapidly
shifting climate zones are only compounding this general process of
biodiversity loss. Biologists expect that half of all species will be
facing extinction by the end of the century.38 [If present
climate-change trends continue, the "global carbon budget" associated
with a 2°C increase in average global temperature will be broken in
sixteen years]{.underline} (while a 1.5°C increase in global average
temperature---staying beneath which is the key to long-term
stabilization of the climate---will be reached in a decade). Earth
System scientists warn that the world is now perilously close to a
Hothouse Earth, in which catastrophic climate change will be locked in
and irreversible.39 The ecological, social, and economic costs to
humanity of continuing to increase carbon emissions by 2.0 percent a
year as in recent decades (rising in 2018 by 2.7 percent---3.4 percent
in the United States), and failing to meet the minimal 3.0 percent
annual reductions in emissions currently needed to avoid a catastrophic
destabilization of the earth's energy balance, are simply
incalculable.40 Nevertheless, major **[energy corporations continue to
lie about climate change, promoting and bankrolling climate
denialism]{.underline}**---while admitting the truth in their internal
documents. These [corporations are working to accelerate the extraction
and production of fossil fuels, including the dirtiest, most greenhouse
gas-generating varieties, reaping enormous profits]{.underline} in the
process. The melting of the Arctic ice from global warming is seen by
capital as a new El Dorado, opening up massive additional oil and gas
reserves to be exploited without regard to the consequences for the
earth's climate. In response to scientific reports on climate change,
Exxon Mobil declared that it intends to extract and sell all of the
fossil-fuel reserves at its disposal.41 Energy corporations continue to
intervene in climate negotiations to ensure that any agreements to limit
carbon emissions are defanged. Capitalist countries across the board are
putting the accumulation of wealth for a few above combatting climate
destabilization, threatening the very future of humanity. Capitalism is
best understood as a competitive class-based mode of production and
exchange geared to the accumulation of capital through the exploitation
of workers' labor power and the private appropriation of surplus value
(value generated beyond the costs of the workers' own reproduction). The
mode of economic accounting intrinsic to capitalism designates as a
value-generating good or service anything that passes through the market
and therefore produces income. It follows that the greater part of the
[social and environmental costs of production outside the market are
excluded in this form of valuation and are treated as mere negative
"externalities," unrelated to the capitalist economy]{.underline}
itself---whether in terms of the shortening and degradation of human
life or the destruction of the natural environment. As environmental
economist K. William Kapp stated, "capitalism must be regarded as an
economy of unpaid costs."42 [We have now reached a point in the
twenty-first century in which the **externalities**]{.underline} of this
irrational system, **[such as the costs of war, the depletion of natural
resources, the waste of human lives, and the disruption of the planetary
environment, now far exceed any future economic benefits that capitalism
offers to society]{.underline}** as a whole. The accumulation of capital
and the amassing of wealth are increasingly occurring at the expense of
an irrevocable rift in the social and environmental conditions governing
human life on earth.43 Some would argue that China stands as an
exception to much of the above, characterized as it is by a seemingly
unstoppable rate of economic advance (though carrying with it deep
social and ecological contradictions). Yet Chinese development has its
roots in the 1949 Chinese Revolution, carried out by the Chinese
Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong, whereby it liberated itself from
the imperialist system. This allowed it to develop for decades under a
planned economy largely free of constraints from outside forces,
establishing a strong agricultural and industrial economic base. This
was followed by a shift in the post-Maoist reform period to a hybrid
system of more limited state planning along with a much greater reliance
on market relations (and a vast expansion of debt and speculation) under
conditions---the globalization of the world market---that were
particularly fortuitous to its "catching up." Through trade wars and
other pressures aimed at destabilizing China's position in the world
market, the United States is already seeking to challenge the bases of
China's growth in world trade. China, therefore, stands not so much for
the successes of late capitalism but rather for its inherent
limitations. The current Chinese model, moreover, carries within it many
of the destructive tendencies of the system of capital accumulation.
Ultimately, China's future too depends on a return to the process of
revolutionary transition, spurred by its own population.44 How did these
disastrous conditions characterizing capitalism worldwide develop? [An
understanding of the failure of capitalism, beginning in the twentieth
century, requires a historical examination of the rise of neoliberalism,
and how this has only served to increase the destructiveness of the
system.]{.underline} Only then can we address the future of humanity in
the twenty-first century.

### ! -- Militarism Inev

Schumpeter (1951) argued that with the rise of the bourgeoisie,
imperialism would disappear and that capitalism would not lend itself to
imperialism. I argue to the contrary that the [contemporary global
capitalism reinforces imperialism and imperialism requires
militarism]{.underline}, jingoism [and capital\'s sponsored
nationalism]{.underline}. It is possible that Schumpeter\'s observation
was accurate regarding the capitalist mode of World War I era, but
[today\'s global capitalism]{.underline} to use Schumpeter\'s insight
[has the power of \"creative destruction\" and continuously **reinvents
itself.**]{.underline} As Schumpeter (1951:96) observed, \"[nationalism
and militarism]{.underline}\" while not creatures of capitalism, [become
\"capitalized\"]{.underline} and in the end draw their best energies
from capitalism. [Capitalism \"keeps them alive]{.underline},
[politically as well as economically\"]{.underline}. [The contemporary
global order has a hegemonic and]{.underline} advanced [industrialized
nation at the helm with the less developed world]{.underline} with its
\"de-nationalized\" [state subservient to it]{.underline}. At least
since WWII, [the United States has historically been]{.underline}
financially, politically, militarily, and according to the proponents of
the empire, culturally [the leader.]{.underline} This leadership has
cost the United States taxpayers much on all fronts. Specifically, the
financial burden of maintaining such a huge armada with sophisticated
weapons systems has been enormous. As the leader of the advanced
industrialized countries the United States taxpayers have been paying
for the expansion of political and economic interests of the Western
ruling elites. [The trade off is in the area of the political support
that the U.S. receives in dealing with international crises or
challenges to global capitalism\'s expansion presented as \"coalition\"
or \"multilateral\" efforts.]{.underline} The foundation of which was
established in the period immediately after World War II with its new
Western dominated multilateral agencies such as the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and agencies associated with the
United Nations. Globalization, both as a new form of imperialism in the
era of informal empire and as a new phase in the intensification of the
expansion and the development of [**global capitalism, demands**
**militarism** as a means of overcoming challenges]{.underline} to its
rule. [Therein lies the fiscal crisis of the state as manifested by the
United States national debt]{.underline}. The dominant classes whose
pursuit of accumulation on a global scale has created the massive debt,
ironically are the owner of most of the national debt. In other words,
**[the cost of accumulation]{.underline}** as O\'Connor (1971) observed
[**is socialized**.]{.underline} To be effective, globalization,
imperialism, and the coercive mechanisms of implementing the
accumulation process must necessarily have the support of the domestic
working classes. The extent of the success of imperialism abroad
requires a concerted effort at convincing the domestic working classes
to support imperialistic policies abroad. Thus [the general public is
coached to view intervention not as imperialism, but as a \"mission\"
reminiscent of \"White man\'s burden]{.underline},\" a \"civilizing
mission,\" and a calling from high above. Convincing the public in the
imperial centers of their providential duties is one thing, to ask it to
pay for the cost of the mission without promising any concrete reward,
however, is quite another. The hard reality is that the cost must be
paid by the taxpayers at the expense of their children education, health
care, pensions and quality time with their families. [The scope of
imperial projects abroad dictates the needed level of internal
conformity which]{.underline} in turn [requires effective social
imperialism]{.underline}. In a democratic society, authentic or not the
public must give its approval to policies involving their everyday life,
their children, and their futures; therefore, it is critical that they
are convinced of the \"ideal\" mission of their government vis-a-vis
other people. Debt of this magnitude accrued in the process of
accumulation of capital, ends up generating much revenue for the very
wealthy creditors who are for the most part the main beneficiaries. This
debt service enhances their income and the capital accumulation process.
As any other indebtedness, national debt serves as one more conveyor
belt for trickle up.

Beginning [with the rise of economic neo-liberalism]{.underline} and
[the]{.underline} global capitalist assault on the working class in the
1980s and the uncompromising and determined policy of crushing all
opposition to its rule around the world, [military might became
indispensible]{.underline}. Massive pouring of resources into the
military industrial complex and the massive tax cuts for the rich in the
United States resulted in the first trillion dollars of accumulated
deficits in 1980-81. The grand aim was the dismantling of the Soviet
\"evil empire\" through a crippling arms race initiated by the Reagan
administration in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in Britain. In
the meantime, the ideology of neo-liberalism aided by militarism was to
facilitate accumulation on a global scale[. Two interruptions in the
accumulation process]{.underline}, namely [the Iranian Revolution of
1979 and the Nicaraguan Revolution]{.underline} [were viewed as
challenges to global accumulation.]{.underline} The Iranian Revolution
was to be at least confined within the borders, if not completely
eliminated. Therefore, Saddam Hussien was called upon to respond to that
challenge by attempting to invade Iran, but was bogged down in an 8 year
long war of attrition. The Nicaraguan Revolution, was challenged by the
army of Contras aided by the Reagan Administration and the rest is a
story well told. [The United States,]{.underline} however [**continued
with** the tradition of American **intervention**]{.underline}
(militarily and otherwise) in the affairs of Latin America[. **To meet
the demand of the military spending**]{.underline}, the Reagan
Administration and the succeeding administrations ran high budget
deficits. [\"Accumulation by dispossession\" is the hallmark of
neo-liberal economic policy]{.underline} (Harvey, 2006:6).
[Globally,]{.underline} the accumulation by dispossession [involves
indebtedness, privatization]{.underline} of state owned industries,
[free trade which is suffocating the most vulnerable countries and
military interventions]{.underline}. The attack on the poor through
indebtedness, eminent domain, pension raiding, and declining access to
social services becomes more problematic (Harvey, 2006:8). Indeed, the
essence of neo-liberalism globally as well as domestically, involves the
domination of capital over labor. In the era of post classic social
imperialism, [the implementation of globalization and the entire
hegemonic and imperialistic strategy]{.underline} [involves a violent
attack on the working class and the poor of the world disguised as free
trade, democracy, freedom, and civility]{.underline}.

#### The impact is necropolitical governmentality --individual authoritarianism causes coercive social discourses and reproduces violent logics of capitalist exploitation and alienation

[In the 1930s, the stock market crash and the onset of global depression
suddenly led to mas- sive waves of bankruptcies and growing unemployment
in the capitalist countries.]{.underline} In Germany, having been
subjected to the reparations of the First World War, inflation sky-
rocketed, leading to massive dislocations and social strains. Here,
[fascism found fertile ground]{.underline}, [particularly given lower
middle classes' authoritarian style of familial
socialization]{.underline}, [the typical result of which was a
sado-masochistic character structure]{.underline}. [Nazi
ideology]{.underline} appealed to and [intensified these
tendencies]{.underline}. By providing a [symbolic community, an elevated
status and dignity of a master race, and despised 'enemies', fascism
provided 'mechanisms of escape' from alienation and powerlessness
through authoritarian submission to the Nazi party and directing
violence and aggression to the Jew.]{.underline} Once again
authoritarianism prefigured the fas- cist mobilizations of the lower
middle classes and segments of the lumpenproletariat. [Closely
intertwined with dominance-submission, destructiveness, as hatred of the
Other, inflicting pain and death upon him/her, was another mechanism
that provided an escape from powerlessness. To inflict pain or take
another's life was to have the same power over life and death as
God]{.underline}. In his later writings, Fromm (1973) argued that
necrophilia, a character-rooted passion for destruction and decay,
develops when more life-affirming passions such as love or justice are
thwarted; under such circumstances, the thwarted passions turn inward
onto the self and become impulses of destruction. For Fromm, [this
tendency toward necrophilia was a consequence of the thwarting of self
that is often found among the alienated and marginal groups produced
under capitalism.]{.underline} Finally, Fromm, echoing De Toqueville,
noted [the extent to which the individual- ism of modern societies
fostered 'automaton conformity' as a 'mechanism of escape'. Modern
people were afraid of looking, acting, or most of all thinking in ways
different from the 'lonely crowd', and felt 'secure' if they were like
everyone else.]{.underline} Thus for Fromm, the basic lament of the
Frankfurt School, the eclipse of critical reason, had a depth
psychological component. Fromm's understanding of the intersection of
history, political economy, and the per- son came together in his
understanding of 'social character'. He argued that [the individ- ual's
character structure, the organization of his/her socialized personality,
desires, and defenses disposed his/her thoughts, action, and
selfhood.]{.underline} At the same time, in each his- torical moment and
in particular social classes, a certain 'social character' was common.
Fromm's concept of '[social character' is quite similar to what is today
called identity.]{.underline} But [his concept is more than a conscious
narrative of self-definition; it further includes a psy- cho-dynamics of
motivation in which social demands and acceptance of social arrange-
ments are insinuated within the person:]{.underline} In studying the
psychological reactions of a social group we deal with the character
structure of the members of the group, that is, of individual persons;
[we are interested, however, not in the peculiarities by which these
persons differ from each other, but in that part of their character
structure that is common to most members of the group.]{.underline} [We
can call this character the 'social character']{.underline}. The 'social
character' necessarily is less specific than the individual character.
In describing the latter we deal with the whole of the traits which in
their particular configuration form the personality structure of this or
that individual. [The 'social character' comprises only a selection of
traits, the essential nucleus of the character structure of most members
of a group which has developed as the result of the basic experiences
and mode of life common to that group. The concept of 'social character'
is a key concept for the understanding of the social
process.]{.underline} (Fromm, 1941) For Fromm, '[social character' as a
historically constituted psycho-cultural formation indicated how society
impacted 'normal' character, how particular notions of selfhood and
underlying psycho-dynamics led to individual satisfactions
that]{.underline}, at the same time, [fostered the behaviors and
understandings that served the interests of society.]{.underline} [When
the character structure of the typical individual more or less
approximates the 'social character', s/he is thus likely to do that
which is necessary and desirable as defined by the culture and will in
so doing find personal gratifications: the 'function of character for
the normal person is to lead him to act according to what is necessary
for him from a practical standpoint and also to give him satisfaction
from his activity psychologically']{.underline} (Fromm, 1947, emphasis
added). Further, s/he will find a psychological affinity for the
justifications of the social order and the authority claims of its
elites -- or those who would rule. In order for elites to exist, the
majority of people must, in Gramsci's sense, assent to hegemony.
Otherwise said, ['social character' can be seen as a form of
internalized hegemony that impels socially required action through
internal compulsion rather than external forces or rewards]{.underline}.
Thus [society harnessed the individual to work toward its ends and
willingly accede to its patterns of authority]{.underline}. Fromm
identified four basic expressions of histori- cally instantiated 'social
character': [receptive, exploitative, hoarding, and
marketing]{.underline}. (There was also a more healthy 'productive'
character, but far too rare to consider.) [While these orientations had
some loose approximation to Freud's theory of psycho- sexual
development, for Fromm, these expressions were more historically based
ways of relating to people]{.underline}. The [Receptive]{.underline}
[Orientation]{.underline}: Similar to Freud's oral character, this type
of person [pas- sively accepts the world and expects
gratifications]{.underline} to come from without. This was com- mon
among peasants who would fatalistically accept the world as it was,
hoping for windfall kindnesses. Such people typically range between
submissive and accepting. The [Exploitative Orientation:]{.underline}
Such people approximate Freud's oral aggressive charac- ter, [taking
what they want from others, whether wealth, ideas or love. This was
typical among dynastic elites and/or colonizers]{.underline}. Such
people enjoy giving orders to and control- ling subordinates, and are
likely to be assertive if not aggressive. The [Hoarding
Orientation]{.underline}: What Freud called the anal retentive, they
[might be par- simonious if not miserly, and tend to accumulate
things,]{.underline} [especially wealth.]{.underline} This was the
typical character of the European merchant classes who would embrace the
Protestant ethic and its worldly asceticism. By saving and investing
profits, they would prosper and become the dominant class in capitalist
societies, fostering managerial control and consumerism. The [Marketing
Orientation:]{.underline} The [phallic aggressive personality is the
person who expects to sell things to others, beginning with his/her
self.]{.underline} [For Fromm, this 'salesman' type was the dominant
form of modern character.]{.underline} S/he was an 'other directed' con-
formist who lived under the illusion of being a self-determined
individual. They would feel free to express their thoughts and feelings,
but not be 'free to have thoughts' of their own. [For the
marketing-oriented person, the powerlessness of the individual in the
rationalized worlds of mass society and the weakness of his/her ties
leads him/her to find a sense of self-esteem based on superficial
qualities]{.underline}. S/he needs the 'right' education, clothes, and
'look' to advertise him/her self in the various arenas in which people
might compete, from work to love and leisure, to assuage deeper feelings
of alienation and powerlessness.

### ! -- Environment 

#### Capitalism is environmentally unsustainable and survives under a bankrupt logic that undergirds all modern conflicts and regions of instability

**Fernandes 18** (Marcelo Fernandes, Ph.D. - Université Libre de
Bruxelles, Research Areas: Econometrics Empirical Finance, Jan-April
2018, \"Imperialism and the Question of System Stability,\" ScieElo,
http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-85292018000100033)///PSC

Numerous Marxist authors -- including Harvey (2004), Callinicos (2009)
and Gowan (2003) -- reject the notion that capitalism could reach a
level of stability capable of putting an end to inter-imperialist
rivalries. But authors such as [Sakellaropoulos (2009), Sakellaropoulos
and Sotiris (2015), and Marshall (2014) have a more consistent
understanding of this phenomenon, since they develop]{.underline} an
explanation [based on Lenin's theory of imperialism]{.underline}.
Therefore, [they manage to establish some opposition to the idea of
system stability analysed in the previous sections]{.underline}. Lenin
(\[1916\] 1979) characterised imperialism as a specific stage of the
capitalist mode of production, resulting from a substantial change in
its organisational structure, the stage of monopoly capitalism, and not
merely a 'preferred' policy of finance capital for territorial expansion
and economic-political control. [Having started only in the last quarter
of the 19th century, imperialism was the result of the inherent
tendencies of the process of capital accumulation -- in which
concentration and centralisation prevail -- and of the contradictions
arising from the class struggle in capitalism, as analysed by
Marx]{.underline}. At this stage, in which monopolies prevailed, crises
were not suppressed, or competition among different capital formations
eliminated. Far from it, **[monopolies amplified the anarchy and
contradictions of the economic world, bringing competition to a level in
which conflicts would escalate]{.underline}**. **[The statement that
cartels can abolish crises is a fable spread by bourgeois economists who
at all costs desire to place capitalism in a favourable
light]{.underline}**. On the contrary, monopoly which is created in
certain branches of industry increases and intensifies the anarchy
inherent in the system of capitalist production as a whole (Lenin
\[1916\] 1979: 701). Lenin also identified finance capital as the
central force of imperialism. [In the financial sphere, a qualitative
change had taken place: unlike the earlier stage in which industrial
capitalism prevailed, the economic impulse of imperialism now lay in
haute finance]{.underline}. Thus, the particularity of imperialism lay
in the intrinsic need to export capital, rather than commodities. It
would be precisely [through the export of capital that the international
character of capitalism with all its economic and social contradictions
would assert itself in an aggressive and irreversible way]{.underline}.
This would not be through the formal incorporation of territories, as
Lenin (\[1916\] 1979: 735) highlighted when he wrote about the informal
British domination of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Even so, the state
plays an essential role in the functioning of capitalism. In the absence
of global government, capital cannot reproduce itself without
nation-states. **[In order to ensure the interests of the bourgeoisie,
the state develops strategies to manage the labour force, intervenes to
maintain the profit of national capital and promote its expansion in the
international economy]{.underline}** (Sakellaropoulos 2009: 63).
However, capital exports also lead to competition among states, since
they also play the role of mediating among the interests of different
ruling classes. Monopolies can join forces in several parts of the
world, yet need to remain linked to their home states where they receive
legal protection, even outside legal systems, when this is convenient
(Harman 2003). [Therefore, international conflicts (economic, political
and/or military) are intrinsic to the system, although moments of
cooperation may prevail]{.underline} (Lenin \[1916\] 1979). Capital
expansion does not necessarily require war, but this cannot be ruled
out. For that reason, **[activities linked to arms acquire a privileged
position in national economies]{.underline}**. That causes a permanent
warmongering atmosphere, since it is functional for monopolies linked to
the war industry to have external enemies, whether real or illusory, to
justify military purchases. Hence, the term 'globalisation', which
describes a capitalist world without borders, available and subservient
to the supposedly stateless capital of a unified bourgeoisie, hides or
denies crucial aspects of the functioning of the international system15
(Halliday 2002; Petras and Veltmeyer 2000; Ruccio 2003). In reality,
**[the concepts of imperialism and globalisation are not
compatible]{.underline}**. Although several Marxist authors started to
use them as a way of explaining contemporary capitalism, [both concepts
cannot be adopted at the same time, since the idea of globalisation
suppresses a series of questions related to the historical development
of the relations of exploitation within the capitalist system, and the
role of imperialism as a theoretical and historical
reference]{.underline} (Sakellaropoulos 2009). The view of various
Marxist authors that the international system is characterised by
stability seems to find support in certain passages of the Manifesto of
the Communist Party, by Marx and Engels (2010). In this understanding,
[conflicts are caused almost exclusively by the division between the
bourgeoisie and proletarians at the international level]{.underline}.
Since international capital has attained unprecedented power, [there is
little room for protest movements that could undermine the
system]{.underline}. This view underestimates the importance of the
state and other forms of struggle, such as the struggle of nations
oppressed by imperialism. [However, even in the Manifesto, the
nation-state problem is already raised when the authors call for the
national liberation of Poland]{.underline} (Marx and Engels 2010: 68).
Another relevant example is the struggle for women's liberation in
countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. These are
countries where the oppression of women is a structural problem --
although not necessarily connected to multinational corporations -- and
any deeper gender-related change favouring women can cause great
instability, since the region plays an important role in the
geopolitical interests of imperialist countries. [The notion that
multinational companies have an extraordinary capacity for co-ordination
that facilitates international exploitation is also more or less
explicit in the writings of the authors referred to in the previous
section]{.underline}. However, this is a questionable theoretical
assumption in the context of Marxism. [The tendency towards the
centralisation and concentration of capital inherent in the movement of
capital does not eliminate competition, but rather brings it to another
level, as pointed out by Lenin, following in the footsteps of
Marx]{.underline}. This is because it is [competition that forces the
capitalist to accumulate uncontrollably]{.underline}. **[Capital
produces without considering its limits, because it is an intrinsic
expansionist force; hence the crises that occur from time to time when
such limits are exceeded]{.underline}**. For the capitalist, there is no
other way but to continue seeking a continuous expansion. In the logic
of capital, there is no room for sentimentality; 'he who does not rise,
descends.' Therefore, [there can be no unified bourgeoisie exploiting
markets around the world in an organised way, capable of suppressing
economic crises and their economic-social consequences]{.underline}. In
fact, the upsurge of capital internationalisation after the Cold War and
the image of companies producing simultaneously in several countries --
although this is nothing new -- create the perception that these
companies are no longer related to their states, as Robinson (2007)
mistakenly suggests.16 But we need to distinguish between appearance and
reality. When General Motors and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy in 2009,
they were bailed out by the US government in their country of origin, at
a cost of US\$80 billion to the American Treasury until 2013 (Beech
2014). And in 2014, the French bank Paribas was fined a staggering
US\$8.9 billion by a New York court of justice because it had
contravened a Federal law, the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act of 1977, by facilitating financial transactions with Cuba, Iran and
Sudan, countries that were under US embargo (Lauer 2014). The French
government intervened directly, in the form of its president, François
Hollande. The Paribas case also runs counter to Panitch and Gindin's
idea that the USA serves the interests of a world capitalist class first
and foremost. Therefore, [in contrast to 'globalisation', the notion of
an 'imperialist chain' formulated by Lenin is still an accurate
description of the hierarchical, uneven, and complex relations arising
from the reproduction of capital in the international
system.]{.underline}17 It brings together the existing capitalist
powers, each of them at a different level of development. According to
Milios and Sotiropoulos (2009: 19), [the notion of 'imperialist chain'
leads to two questions. The first is about the law of uneven
development.]{.underline} According to Lenin, **[capitalism could never
be a stable system because uneven development causes changes in the
correlation of forces of the more advanced nations, tending to erode the
centre's power in relation to new poles of power with greater economic
dynamism]{.underline}**. Consequently, the contradictions among the
powers making up the imperialist chain would escalate (Lenin \[1916\]
1979: 760). The law of uneven development is central to explaining
relations among the countries in the imperialist chain, providing an
economic basis for military conflicts. [The second question is about the
weakest link in the imperialist chain. Uneven development creates the
possibility of revolutions in the relatively weaker links of the chain,
and not in those states in which the productive forces are more
advanced, as Marx initially predicted. But this is a relative position:
each country in the imperialist chain is weaker or stronger than the
other links in the chain]{.underline} (Poulantzas 1979: 23). Indeed, the
international scenario that has emerged at the beginning of the 21st
century does not seem to confirm the idea that the capitalist system
tends towards stability. On the economic front, [crises have become more
frequent in the 'globalisation' era]{.underline}. [They began with the
Mexican crisis]{.underline} (1994-5), which had serious repercussions,
since Mexico used to be regarded as a model to be followed due to
neoliberal reforms implemented since the late 1980s. [Later on, the
crises in East Asia]{.underline} (1997-8), [Russia]{.underline} (1998)
[and Brazil]{.underline} (1998-1999) [exposed the fragility of the
international financial architecture that emerged in the
1970s.]{.underline} The turn of the century was the stage for new
economic turmoil, as in Turkey and Argentina in 2001. Afterwards, [the
international economy went through a period of relative calm that lasted
for about five years]{.underline}, **[but this was soon followed by the
US subprimecrisis in 2007, triggering the greatest global economic
crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s]{.underline}**. The
crisis began in the USA, the centre of capitalism, and affected a major
part of Europe as well as other world regions. **[This exposed the
fragility of the global financial architecture, and caused unrest about
the economic order in several governments and within US society itself,
as evidenced by the protest movement 'Occupy Wall
Street']{.underline}**. Despite the intense debate that followed about
the reforms needed to prevent a crisis of such magnitude from happening
again, few proposals have been implemented, mainly because of the
contradictory interests inside the imperialist chain. Added to this,
[low levels of economic growth in the wake of the crisis have tended to
make the environment even less conducive to fresh understandings,
stirring up contradictions instead]{.underline}. Given this, it cannot
be concluded that the international economic system is more stable,
despite the enormous capacity of intervention of central banks, the US
Federal Bank in particular, as evidenced in the worst moments of the
financial crisis of 2008. Likewise, [it cannot be concluded that
competition among states no longer exists, and that the problem remains
only in the economic sphere.]{.underline} Countries continue to use
uneven structures of power to maintain and conquer new spaces of
accumulation, according to the interests of their capitalists. [During
the 1990s, when the USA expanded economically at an unprecedented rate,
it managed to maintain its hegemony over other powers, preventing the
emergence of autonomous regional strategies with relative
success]{.underline}. **[This did not make the US state more
friendly]{.underline}**, as Fiori (2008), Gowan (2004), and
Sakellaropoulos and Sotiris (2015) demonstrate. In fact, [shortly after
the end of the Cold War, the central powers adopted some forms of
intervention as legitimate, justified by arguments related to violations
of human rights]{.underline},18 [the war on drug cartels in Latin
America, the fight against corruption, the preservation of international
security, and, more recently, the preventive 'war against
terror']{.underline} (Bandeira 2014; Sakellaropoulos and Sotiris 2008:
220; Johnson 2004: 31). However, as the law of uneven development
prevails, [new poles of power are emerging]{.underline}. [Cooperation
among states has become more problematic]{.underline} due to the growing
multipolarisation of the international system, as can be seen in the
formation of the BRICS alliance and the Union of South American Nations
(USAN), for example, and the relative decrease of US power (Fernandes
2016). **[This situation helps to explain the growing reaction against
US foreign policy, which after '09/11' began to use a warmongering and
interventionist language]{.underline}**. Since then, the USA has
fomented conflict in several parts of the world, ignoring the
sovereignty of countries like Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). Libya
and Syria were also targets of US interventions in conjunction with
France, Britain and a group of Middle Eastern countries with diverse
interests in the region (Bandeira 2014: 382-384). Following the bombing
of Libya in 2011, the regime of Muammar al-Gaddafi was overthrown. The
same modus operandi was used in Syria.19 However, [**Russia has played a
decisive role in preserving the Bashar al-Assad regime. More recently,
the intervention in Ukraine has created strong instability in the
region, leading to a referendum on the reincorporation of Crimea into
Russia**.]{.underline}20 This is evidence that rivalries among the great
powers persist, and that Russia is playing an increasingly active role.
Finally**[, it should be noted that, despite the persistent global
economic crisis, many countries -- including numerous European countries
-- continue to spend a lot of money on arms]{.underline}** (Marshall
2014: 328). According to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI), [global military expenditure reached US\$1.68
trillion in 2015, representing a real increase of 1% over
2014]{.underline}. This was the first increase since 2011. But before
that, expenditure grew steadily for 13 years between 1998 and 2011
(Perlo-Freeman et al 2016). The [USA spends far more on armaments than
any other country -- 36% of the total in 2015 -- but European
expenditure should be noted.]{.underline} As shown by Slijper (2013),
the military spending of countries such as Spain, Greece and Italy,
which were at the epicentre of the crisis in the euro area and have
struggled to implement economic austerity programmes at great social
cost, remains impressively high. [This clearly contradicts the Kautskyan
perspective, which predicted a reduction in military spending as a
primary result of ultra-imperialism.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism destroys the environment and devalues natural life in the face of productivity.

In the first of his accounts of his voyages to the New World,
Christopher Columbus describes the island he named Española as an Edenic
land whose "mountains and plains, and meadows, and fields, are so
beautiful and rich for planting and sowing, and rearing cattle of all
kinds, and for building towns and villages."54 Greed and lust for power
drip from Columbus's pen as he describes a marvelous land of abundant
harbors and many rivers, "most of them bearing gold," and populated by
naïvely generous inhabitants "so liberal of all they have that no one
would believe it who had not seen it." For Columbus, the biodiversity of
this new world is equally notable, for, as he notes the islands are
"covered with trees of a thousand kinds of such great height that they
seemed to reach the skies," trees in which "the nightingale was singing
as well as other birds of a thousand different kinds."55 Columbus'
breathless description of the material riches to be found in the "New
World" set the tone for the European imperial expansion in the
subsequent five centuries. As John Donne's sonnet to his mistress
suggests, the lust for this imagined natural bounty was so strong that
it permeated all aspects of European life, penetrating even the erotic
fantasies of poets such as Donne. The flora and fauna of newly
"discovered" lands appeared to Europeans to be an apparently boundless
store of natural wealth, free for the taking. **[Today we confront the
baleful legacy of this feckless appropriation and dissipation of the
global environmental commons.]{.underline}** If, in other words,
**[human beings have engaged in notable forms of ecocide throughout our
history]{.underline}**, it is only with the expansion of Europe and the
development of modern European representation of Columbus landing in the
"New World," where naive indigenous people hand him their treasure in a
sign of welcome. capitalism that ecocide has taken on a truly global
extent and planet-consuming destructiveness. [As Europeans subjugated
and colonized "virgin" lands, they dramatically augmented processes of
environmental degradation and extinction.]{.underline} [**The expansion
of capitalist social relations** **through** European colonialism and
**imperialism** pushed what had previously been regional environmental
catastrophes **to a planetary scale.**]{.underline} In addition, by
transforming nature into a commodity that could be bought and sold,
capitalist society shifted humanity's relations with nature into a mode
of intense ecological exploitation unimaginable in previous epochs.
Capitalism is not necessarily more immoral than previous social systems
with regard to cruelty to humans and the gratuitous destruction of
nature. [As a mode of production and a social system, however,
**capitalism requires people to be destructive of the environment.**
**Three destructive aspects of the capitalist system stand out when we
view this system in relation to the extinction crisis:**]{.underline}
[1) capitalism tends to degrade the conditions of its own production; 2)
it must expand ceaselessly in order to survive; 3) it generates a
chaotic world system, which in turn intensifies the extinction
crisis.]{.underline}56 By wrenching specific elements out of the complex
ecosystems in which they are intertwined and turning them into
commodities, that is, **[capital remorselessly breaks down the complex
natural world into impoverished but exchangeable forms, simultaneously
discarding all those elements that don't appear to have immediate
exchange value.]{.underline}** In addition, as Marx argued in the
Grundrisse, "capital is the endless and limitless drive to go beyond its
limiting barrier."57 This argument is quite clear on an intuitive level:
any corporation that doesn't outcompete its rivals will be driven out of
business in short order. [Finally, as the era of globalization
demonstrates, capitalism creates a turbulent world in which "all that is
solid melts into air," as established modes of governance and all other
social forms are torn apart by a gale of **"creative
destruction."**]{.underline} While many commentators have highlighted
these dynamics of capitalism previously, they are particularly starkly
evident when seen through the lens of extinction. [These three key
ecological contradictions of capitalism are interwoven in practice, but
their particular dynamics are more evident when they are considered in
isolation, as they are in the following sections**. The examples
discussed in these sections span the capitalist epoch, from the earliest
years of merchant capitalism to contemporary forms of neoliberal
globalization.**]{.underline} Yet if these examples suggest that the
ecological contradictions of capital are endemic, they also underline
the remorselessly intensifying character of capital's death-dealing
reign.

#### Capitalism destroys the environment and is not self-correcting.

Extinction,' 2016\] -TB

Capitalism's Ceaseless Expansion **[Capitalism is dependent on the
conditions of production that it relentlessly degrades. By fecklessly
consuming the environment, capital is figuratively sawing off the tree
branch it is sitting on.]{.underline}** But it does so because it must:
it is a system based on ceaseless accumulation. **[Capitalists must
constantly reinvest their accumulated profits if they are to survive
against competitors, driving capital to expand at a compound
rate.]{.underline}**70 Every limit to capital's expansion appears as an
obstacle that it strives to overcome and fold into a new round of
accumulation. But we live on a planet that is self-evidently finite.
[**Capital's logic is consequently that of a cancer cell, growing
uncontrollably until it destroys the body that hosts it**. The whaling
industry is perhaps the best instance of this all-consuming drive to
expand accumulation. Whales have endured the most prolonged and vicious
attack by humans of any single species of animal.]{.underline}71 Prior
to the rise of capitalism, whales were hunted in sustainable numbers by
indigenous communities such as the Inuit in the Arctic, and by
coastal-dwelling peoples such as the Basques, who intercepted immense
but timid Bowhead and right whales as they made their annual migratory
trek throug the Bay of Biscay.72 The Inuit and Basques killed whales in
relatively limited numbers. But, as the industrial revolution took off,
whales provided valuable commodities, including oil used for
illumination and for greasing machinery in the factories of the period.
As a consequence, the growing markets of early modern capitalism
exhausted stocks of coastal whales, and by the late seventeenth century
whalers had to take to the open ocean in search of prey.73 Maritime
powers of the time such as the Dutch articulated a doctrine of freedom
of the seas for their whaling fleets, opening the rich fisheries of the
North Atlantic to commercial whaling by the competing European powers of
the day.74 No efforts were made by the Europeans and their North
American competitors to conserve stocks of whales. Instead, whalers
acted as if their quarry was inexhaustible. European whaling took the
industrialized slaughter of animals to the far reaches of the globe.
Competition led to increasingly sophisticated techniques of slaughter,
from the faster sailing ships of the late eighteenth century that hunted
right whales to near extinction in several decades, to the invention in
the midnineteenth century of the explosive harpoon gun and huge
steam-powered factory ships, which allowed whalers to hunt faster fin
and sperm whales in devastating numbers.75 Although it was clearly in
the industry's interest to limit the accelerating predation, the
competitive dynamic of industrial capitalism made such forms of
conservation impossible. Instead, whalers came up with far-fetched
arguments to justify their monumentally shortsighted plunder of the
oceans. For instance, in a chapter of Moby Dick entitled "Does the
Whale's Magnitude Diminish? Will He Perish?" Melville's protagonist
Ishmael ponders the question of the whale's extinction. Although he
admits that whales were once far more easy to find in the oceans, he
concludes that this is because whales now travel in bigger but less
numerous groups, and that they have moved to the Poles in order to
escape the whaling industry. As Ishmael's torturous reasoning suggests,
whale populations had to be represented as limitless in order to justify
the unsustainable competition of the industry. By the early twentieth
century, humans had emptied the world's oceans of so many whales that
commercial whaling was no longer a viable major industry.76 The
decimation of whales and the crash of the whaling industry also
illustrate the folly of the economic doctrines that grew up to
legitimate capitalism. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776) is the
clearest formulation of these doctrines. Smith believed that
self-interested competition in the free market would generate beneficial
outcomes for all by keeping prices low and creating incentives for a
variety of goods and services. As Smith put it, "by pursuing his own
interest \[the individual\] frequently promotes that of the society more
effectually than when he really intends to promote it."77 Private vices
were purportedly transmuted into public virtues through the operation of
what Smith described as the "invisible hand" of the market. Like many of
his contemporaries, Smith believed in the inevitability of progress,
which he assumed involved the production of greater material wealth.
Yet, Smith's invisible hand completely ignored the issue of depletion
and even extinction of such natural "resources" as fur-bearing animals
and whales. In fact, classical economics is blithely ignorant of the
impact of turning the earth's resources into capital, focusing only on
the secondary problem of the distribution of resources between different
competing ends.78 But the earth's resources are not just scarce. They
are finite. Like the whaling industry, classical economics is
constitutively blind to this finitude, and consequently encourages both
producers and consumers to use up resources as fast as possible in
pursuit of greater profits and growth. Mainstream economics as
formulated by Adam Smith and as practiced today celebrates
values---selfishness, gluttony, competitiveness, and
shortsightedness---that were once viewed as cardinal sins, and in the
process provides intellectual justification for capitalism's disastrous
pillage of the planet. Capitalism's Chaotic World If capitalism is based
on the illusory hope that a mysterious "invisible hand" will reconcile
ruthlessly self-interested competition with the common good, modern
capitalist society is correspondingly organized around antagonistic
nation-states whose competing interests, it is vainly hoped, will be
attuned through various international forums. Yet, wracked by the
periodic crises of over-accumulation that are a structural feature of
capitalism, the bourgeoisie is impelled to seek markets abroad. Since
their peers in other nations are driven to cope with system-wide crises
through similar expansionary policies, the result is increasing
inter-imperial competition and endemic warfare.79 Capitalism thus
generates a chaotic world system that compounds ecological crises. In
some cases, ecocide is a conscious strategy of imperialism, generating
what might be termed ecological warfare. For example, the destruction of
the great herds of bison that roamed the Great Plains of North America
was European settlers proudly display skulls of slaughtered bison,
carnage that was a key element in the campaign against Native Americans.
a calculated military strategy designed to deprive Native Americans of
the environmental resources on which they depended.80 When Europeans
first arrived, the plains were inhabited by tens of millions of bison,
providing indigenous peoples with resources that allowed them to
maintain their autonomous, nomadic lifestyle. Commercial hunting of
bison began in the 1830s, soon reaching a toll of two million animals a
year.81 By 1891, there were less than 1,000 bison left on the continent,
and the Native Americans had been crushed--- defeated militarily and
forced onto a series of isolated, barren reservations. **[Many of these
reservations were subsequently turned into "national sacrifice zones"
during the Cold War, when nuclear weapons were exploded in sites such as
Nevada in order to perfect the US's military arsenal.]{.underline}**82
[Similar ecological violence was meted out by the US military to other
parts of the planet. During the Vietnam War, for instance, nearly twenty
million gallons of pesticides were sprayed on the tropical forests of
Vietnam in an effort to destroy the ecological base of the revolutionary
Vietnamese forces.]{.underline} This virulent campaign of ecological
warfare eventually generated a revolt among US scientists, who balked at
what they called the systematic ecocide being carried out by the
military in Vietnam.83 Despite this history of war resistance, the US
military, with more than 700 bases worldwide, remains the single most
polluting organization on the planet.84 In many cases, however, animals
and plants simply suffer as collateral damage in the inter-imperial
rivalries generated by capitalism. In a system of competing capitalist
nations, no individual state has the power or responsibility to
counteract the system's tendencies toward ecological degradation.
**[Indeed, inter-imperial competition impels individual states to shirk
responsibility, seeking to score points by blaming their competitors for
failing to address the environmental crisis. This fatal contradiction of
capitalist society has been abundantly evident in the rounds of United
Nations-sponsored climate negotiations during the last two
decades.]{.underline}** During these negotiations, advanced
industrialized countries such as the United States and Great Britain
have refused to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions significantly
until developing nations such as China, India, and Brazil offer to cut
their emissions as well. [The industrializing nations respond by
pointing out that their per capita emissions are still far lower than
those of the wealthy nations of Europe and North America, and argue that
these countries have benefited from two hundred years of industrial
growth, effectively colonizing the atmosphere to the exclusion of
formerly colonized nations.]{.underline} As a result of these
antagonistic positions, no binding international agreement on emissions
reductions has been reached, despite years of desperate pleas from
scientists and civil society. It is not simply that the climate and
extinction crises have arrived at a uniquely unpropitious moment when
neoliberal doctrines of financial deregulation, corporate power, and
emaciated governance are hegemonic.85 [Rather, the deadlocked climate
negotiations are a reflection of the fundamentally irrational, chaotic,
violenceridden, and ecocidal world system produced by capitalism. **Can
capitalist society reform itself sufficiently to cope with the
extinction crisis? This is not simply unlikely. It is impossible in the
long run.**]{.underline} While it is true that the environmental
movement did manage to push corporations and the state into cleaning up
local crises from the late 1960s onwards, climate change and extinction
suggest that the capitalist system is destroying its ecological
foundations when viewed on a longer temporal scale. **[Recall that
capital's solution to periodic systemic crises is to initiate a new
round of accumulation. Capital essentially tries to grow itself out of
its problems. But, as we have seen, the extinction crisis is precisely a
product of unchecked, blinkered growth.]{.underline}** In such a
context, conservation efforts can never be more than a paltry bandage
over a gaping wound. As laudable as they are, conservation efforts
largely fail to address the deep inequalities that capitalism generates,
which push the poor to engage in deforestation and other forms of
over-exploitation. Many of today's major conservation organizations were
established in the last half of the twentieth century: the Nature
Conservancy (1951), World Wildlife Fund (1961), Natural Resources
Defense Council (1970), and Conservation International (1987). Yet
during this same period, a new round of accumulation based on neoliberal
principles of unrestrained hyper-capitalism has engulfed the planet.
**[The neoliberal era has seen much of the global South become
increasingly indebted, leading international agencies such as the World
Bank to force debtor nations to harvest more trees, mine more minerals,
drill for more oil, and generally deplete their natural resources at
exponentially greater rates.]{.underline}** The result has been a
steeply intensifying deterioration in global ecosystems, including a
massive increase in the rate of extinction.86 Despite this dramatic
collapse of global ecosystems, the climate change crisis has unleashed a
fresh round of accumulation, obscured by upbeat language about the
investment opportunities opened up by the green economy. Neoliberal
solutions to the climate crisis such as voluntary carbon offsets are not
only failing to diminish carbon emissions, but are also dramatically
augmenting the enclosure and destruction of the global environmental
commons.87 Such programs allow polluting industries in wealthy nations
to continue emitting carbon, while turning the forests and agricultural
land of indigenous people and peasants in the global South into carbon
dioxide "sinks" or biodiversity "banks." Under the green economy, vast
numbers of people, plants, and animals are being sacrificed as
collateral damage in the ecocidal exploitation of the planet.
**[Capitalism, it is clear, cannot solve the environmental crises it is
causing.]{.underline}**

[One liberal 'solution' to the tension between commerce and interstate
war was]{.underline} put in place institutionally from 1945 onwards
through [the dual mechanism of a cosmopolitan federation of states, and
the hegemonic role of a dominant liberal, capitalist state]{.underline}.
The pacification of commerce, the global coordination of capitalist
accumulation, the financing of post-war economic development, the
shaping of much of the institutional framework of the United Nations,
and [the backing of international law and global security through
military force, has been held in place since 1945 through the expansion
of the military, bureaucratic, political and economic power of the
United States of America]{.underline} (Mann 2013). The liberal theorist
G. John Ikenberry describes the link between the current liberal world
order and American hegemony: The pivotal moment in liberal order
building occurred in the years after World War II. It was then that
America's desire for a congenial world order -- open, stable, friendly
-- turned into an agenda for the construction of a liberal hegemonic
order. But this shift was not entirely deliberate. The United States
took charge of the liberal project and then found itself creating and
running an international order. America and liberal order became fused.
It was a distinctive type of order -- organised around American
hegemonic authority, open markets, cooperative security, multilateral
solutions, social bargains, and democratic community. It was also built
on core hegemonic bargains. These bargains determined how power and
authority would be apportioned. So although the United States ran the
liberal order and projected power, it did so within a system of rules
and institutions -- of commitments and restraints. It underwrote order
in various regions of the world. It provided public goods related to
stability and openness, and it engaged in bargaining and reciprocity
with its allies and partners. The centre of gravity of this order was
the West -- and as it moved outward to Asia, Latin America, and the
developing world, the liberal logic gave way to more traditional
imperial and great-power domination. Globally, the order was
hierarchical -- dominated by the United States -- but infused with
liberal characteristics (Ikenberry 2012, p. 334). For critical theory,
and in particular for 'world systems theory', [the idea of the
benevolent role of the USA]{.underline} as a liberal hegemon which
managed to reconcile the unsocial aspects of global capitalism and
global peace [has been viewed far more problematically]{.underline}.7
For Thomas McCormick [the]{.underline} post-1945 [global economic and
political order underwritten by US hegemonic power]{.underline}
[combined the aim of pacifying global commercial relations with the goal
of placing US industrial and financial capital at the centre of a system
of global capital accumulation]{.underline} which the US state attempted
to control and direct. For McCormick the explicit aim developed by US
policy makers in the 1940s and 1950s was to create a stable and secure
global system of capitalist accumulation in which US industry and
finance would have access to global markets unencumbered by old European
imperial preferences, socialist planned economies or postcolonial
national development. [Over the middle decades of the twentieth century
this would be achieved through the 'carrot' of development aid and
credit tied to economic and political structural reforms, and the
'stick' of open and covert wars aimed at disciplining predominantly
developing states into accepting a US-directed global capitalist
development model]{.underline} (McCormick 1995). [In many cases in the
developing world,]{.underline} such as Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s,
and in Iraq from the 1990s to the present, [the 'stick' of war has
involved a brutal scorched earth policy in which American and US-funded
proxy armies decimated urban and peasant populations and attempted to
maintain 'international peace and security' through the terror
of]{.underline} aerial bombardment, land invasion, and
[endless]{.underline} 'dirty [wars']{.underline} (Mann 2013; Chomsky
1991; Westad 2007). [Such aggressive wars,]{.underline} often drawing
upon the natural law language of the 'just war' (Douzinas 2007, pp.
236--66; Kochi 2009, pp. 23--47), **[can be interpreted as a modern
continuation of the violence of 'primitive accumulation' in which
natural resources are secured and national economies dismantled and
brought firmly into the orbit of privatisation and capitalist
markets]{.underline}** (Neocleous 2014). **[This violence operates also
as a form of 'class war' in which economic and state resources are
brought under the control of local elites supported by American
capital]{.underline}** (Robinson 1996). Such wars have also extended a
degree of 'biopolitical' control over populations in both the developing
world and in the West. [Justified via a discourse of 'security',
'emergency' and 'state of exception' the portrayal of internal and
foreign threats]{.underline} ('communism', 'terrorism') [have been used
to discipline and control populations and globally extend economic and
social policies of capitalist accumulation]{.underline} (Agamben 1998;
Hardt and Negri 2001; Douzinas 2007; Neocleous 2008; Butler 2010).

Considering that debate, my core argument maintains that [American
decline pertains]{.underline} not only [to the decreasing economic
vitality underscored by the concrete detrimental effects generated
through neoliberalism vis-à-vis the sharpening material inequality
within the US]{.underline}. Rather, decline [also constitutes America's
decreasing appeal and legitimacy as a dominant actor in the
international system]{.underline}. The latter element becomes much more
visible especially in the case of the Trump presidency when racist,
sexist, and blatantly nationalist discourses that have become so
normalized in global and national mainstream public spheres. [Various
structural deficiencies and injustices that are entrenched in the US
neoliberal political economy]{.underline} --- a governance model that
many countries worldwide have adopted in varying scales and extent of
localization--- have facilitated this decline of American power.
Specifically, [the Trump administration has accelerated neoliberal
policies coupled with authoritarian discourses and
practices]{.underline} in ways that have meaningfully undermined the
legitimating foundations of American power. Therefore, the puzzle on
American decline is not only a problem of discursive legitimation as
punctuated by the horrendous rhetoric of Trump. Rather, [the logic of

distributive injustice within the US]{.underline} and in the world
economy, and Trump unabashedly championed that logic without
instrumentally invoking discourses on human rights, democracy, and rule
of law. This paper engages with the aforementioned opposing stances on
American decline in three exploratory ways. First, I offer a more
holistic conception of American power, particularly by highlighting both
its materialist and ideational foundations that co-constitute each other
during its periods of ascent, consolidation, and decline2. Many scholars
in those two opposing stances underscore only the materialist elements
of American power, as demonstrated by military prowess and economic
indicators, and unfortunately, sidelining the importance of moral appeal
and claims for legitimacy of American power. Amid the increasing
material strength of rival powers such as China, the Trump presidency
reinforces the decline of American power as it has blatantly eschewed
its justificatory and normative underpinnings that his predecessors had
quite consistently invoked, as the case maybe with the discourses on
democracy, human rights, rule of law, and the purported shared benefits
accrued from increasing economic globalization. Second, I underscore the
mutually reinforcing interdependence of domestic and transnational
dimensions of US power. Scholars in the decline debate usually highlight
the transnational dimensions of the American power compared to other
states in the international system. Yet, that analytic emphasis fails to
recognize the two faces of American power, particularly its domestic and
transnational elements. Indeed, the contradictions of neoliberalism as
the core element of the domestic and transnational foundations of
American power have facilitated its further decline. Domestically,
**[the sharpening material inequality within the US generates pervasive
internal social conflicts,]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** as
research shows in the field of democratization studies, **[could lead to
democratic backsliding or other forms of political
instability]{.underline}** (Rapley 2004; Regilme 2014; Boix 2003). At
the transnational level, neoliberalism, as a constitutive paradigm of
American power, shows that [unregulated financial markets, the pervasive
commodification of human life, and the weakening of public goods
provision **undermine the legitimacy of American power**]{.underline}
--- an outcome that becomes more pronounced especially when other rising
powers discursively provide alternatives to the current world order3. As
[the US promotes neoliberal principles and unfettered wealth
accumulation within and beyond its formal borders, its long-term
domestic political and social stability are at risk, which in turn,
**undermines America's material capacities and legitimacy to project its
power abroad**]{.underline}. This means that **[self-regulating market
and socio-political stability are inherently incompatible]{.underline}**
(Polanyi 2001). Referring to the 'trilemma paradox', Dani Rodrik (2012)
underscores the fundamental contradictions in the contemporary
international system: [that the simultaneous pursuit of democracy,
economic globalization, and national self-**determination is a recipe
for disaster**]{.underline}. This broader argument is further supported
by quantitative research on the political effects of neoliberal
globalization among advanced industrialized democracies since the 1960s.
Particularly, "more trade and FDI \[foreign direct investments\] are
associated with a turn to anti-internationalism and anti-globalization",
while "social welfare spending also seems less and less able to mitigate
this relationship" (Milner 2018, 40). This backlash against increasing
economic interdependence through neoliberalism has generated deep-seated
feelings of exclusion and profound material suffering for many people,
who are unable to reap the benefits of globalization.

### ! -- Colonialism 

#### Capitalist structures of [colonialism]{.underline} and [globalization]{.underline} result in poverty, inequality, and [forced migration]{.underline}---that [disproportionately]{.underline} targets Sub-Saharan Africa 

**Yeboah '18** (Ian, Professor of Geography at Miami University. His
research interests are at the nexus of globalization, urbanization,
migration, development and poverty with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa,

African Identities, Conclusion,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/14725843.2017.1332983>, JLin)

This paper has argued that [**current emigration of Sub-Saharan Africans
should be tied to the global capitalist system** in a
historical-structuralist analysis. This is because an
**asymmetrical**]{.underline} 82 I. E. A. YEBOAH [**relationship** has
always existed between the region and the world as a whole
(]{.underline}Cooper, 2014; Obeng-Odoom, 2016). [This
political--economic analysis of capitalism's historical use of the
region's human capital should be constructed as part of the postcolonial
development project]{.underline} (Chakrabarty, 2011; Spivak, 2010). By
conflating global capital's use of the region's human capital with
capitalist expansion's regimes of accumulation (slavery, colonialism and
globalization), this paper has three main findings. First, [a
historical-structuralist analysis reveals that current migration out of
the region, under globalization, is a continuation of the deliberate
exploitation of the region's human capital by global
capital.]{.underline} Second, the use of NELM has resulted in a focus on
remittances and brain drain vs. brain gain (De Haas, 2010), as well as
national migration polices as the focus of development policy in
countries of the region. Though well intentioned, this focus does not
capture the full extent of the region's development potential. In fact,
NELM, which is the prevailing theoretical framework for understanding
migration out of the region, seems specific to analysis of how **[human
capital of the region has been used in only one regime of accumulation:
globalization]{.underline}**. It is difficult to see how NELM can be
used to analyze how the region's human capital was used in either
slavery or colonialism. Third, [under globalization, it is mostly the
cream of the crop that has embarked upon emigration out of the region to
the global core]{.underline}. Even though the case-study countries can
boast of less than 10% of their adult population attaining college
degrees, more than half of Nigerian-born immigrants in the United States
have attained a college degree. This [trend is contributing **toward a
brain and skill drain out of Sub-Saharan Africa** and its attendant
underdevelopment of the region]{.underline} (see Saravia & Miranda,
2004). In light of these three findings, how can Sub-Saharan African
countries frame contemporary policy? The focus should be on development
policy that grows their economies, changes the structure of their
economies and institutions within their economies, alongside migration
policy. It can be argued that return migrants to the continent in this
era of transnational migration will also serve as agents of development
of the region. But, the recent collection by Akesson and Baaz (2015)
argues that [even though return migrants to countries]{.underline} such
as Congo, Somalia, Ghana, Senegal, Burundi, South Sudan, and Cape Verde
[may bring with them capital, know-how, technology, and connections to
the global economy, **their contribution to the development process is
wrought with difficulty**]{.underline}. Effectively [the 'goodies'
brought by return migrants such as capital **are not always advantageous
and may even hamper successful development efforts.**]{.underline} This
is not to refute the fact that the region benefits from remittances that
emigrants send back to their source countries. There is uncertainty
about the scale of remittances but global remittances have grown from
\$132 billion in 2000 to \$514 billion in 2012. In 2012, an estimated
\$31 billion was remitted to Sub-Saharan Africa with \$21 billion of
this going to Nigeria alone (Migration Policy Institute, 2014). In
Ghana, for example, it is estimated that remittances are now the second
source of foreign currency earnings, only behind cocoa. Even within the
NELM framework, debate on the developmental impacts of remittances has
been 'settled' (see Adams & Page, 2005; Bollard et al., 2011; Wong,
2006). Households use remittances to alleviate poverty and to support
household consumption in sectors such as education, healthcare,
nutrition, and housing provision. Remittances are not used to grow
national or regional economies in direct ways nor are they used to
change institutions associated with economies. At best, remittances,
therefore, only contribute indirectly toward development through
multiplier effects. AFRICAN IDENTITIES 83 What a
historical-structuralist analysis points to is that while the debates
and contributions of brain drain, brain gain, and remittances are
germane for countries of the region, [it is also important to address
the issues of why people migrate, especially in desperate
ways]{.underline} as revealed by the Reuters report of 15 April 2015. In
essence **[it boils down to the deep-seated structures created by
capitalism under regimes of accumulation such as colonialism and
globalization]{.underline}** and as Obeng-Odoom (2017) argues, [these
**structures result in poverty, underdevelopment, inequality, and a
sense of nihilism (**]{.underline}often around land as a factor of
production) associated with life in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is nothing
wrong with developing national migration policies that focus on brain
drain, brain gain, and remittances, but this should be preceded by
[efforts to change the structure of economies and institutions and to
grow economies of the region]{.underline}. If the youth of Sub-Saharan
Africa leave their countries out of desperation, perhaps the solution
should partly focus on those structural aspects of the region that make
its youth leave out of desperation. It is not surprising to see the
cream of the crop leaving countries like Ghana where there is an
'Association of Unemployed University Graduates.' It is when people can
find jobs after graduating college or high school that any migration
policy will be meaningful. Similarly, there is nothing wrong with using
migration as part of the development calculus of a country in an era of
transnationalism and globalization. However, individual and household
decisions to migrate should not be made out of the desperation caused by
structural and institutional bankruptcies in economic and social makeups
of countries. [**Decisions to migrate should be spontaneous rather than
structured indirectly by mechanisms of capitalism.** After all, the
asymmetrical relationship between Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the
world **implies that citizens of the region have agency.**]{.underline}
They should use their agency freely rather than in response to defunct
economic and institutional structures in their countries of origin. How
can countries of the global core fashion contemporary policy to deal
with the migration crisis, especially the Sub-Saharan African component
of it? It depends upon prevailing political attitudes in these
countries. In today's ear of conservative and nationalistic fervor in
the United States and Great Britain, [it is not surprising that the
migration crisis is viewed with pessimism]{.underline} (Obeng-Odoom,
2017). For people who think this way, migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa
should not leave their countries of origin and if they choose to come to
the core, border controls should be instituted to prevent them from
coming. However, [neoliberals tend to be triumphant of periphery-core
migration and humanists tend to be optimistic of such
migration]{.underline}. They both argue that such migration is a
win--win for both the core and the periphery. Because of the brain gain
to the core accompanying such migrants of the creative class, they
advocate a temporarization, and integration of migrations into their
destinations through assimilation and acculturation. Source countries
also benefit from migration through remittances and brain gain. Thus,
countries such as Ghana and Senegal have been courting their emigrants
with instruments such as dual citizenship and diaspora homecoming
conferences. Effectively, the 'three Rs' of recruit, remittance, and
return aptly describe neoliberal policies around migration (Obeng-Odoom,
2017, 161--163). In this regard, countries of the global core can
partner with Sub-Saharan African countries in their economic development
efforts (Sachs, 2005). In the prevailing current of conservative
nationalism in the global core, though, Sub-Saharan governments may be
better off focusing on developing their countries for their youth to
live and work at home

### ! -- Exploitation 

#### Capitalism is inherently tied to patterns of exploitation and oppression---breeds violent infighting to cement control

**Mentan '16** (Tatah, Theodore Lentz scholar of Peace and Security
Studies and Professor of Political Science, "Neoliberalism and
Imperialism: Dissecting the Dynamics of Global Oppression," Published by
African Books Collective, pp. 186-188,
<https://muse.jhu.edu/book/47794>, JLin)

Why Contemporary Capitalism needs Oppressive Exploitation [Capitalism is
a system based on exploitation]{.underline}. For Marxists, this has a
precise scientific meaning. Capitalists take for themselves the monetary
values created by or belonging to other people --- usually workers, but
also small farmers and, to varying degrees, small shop owners and
nominally independent trades people. 187 This value is what their
capital consists of. [But exploitation does not exhaust the harmful
effects that capitalism has on the rest of the world. **Capitalist
society also invents many forms of oppression, as well as perpetuating
many inherited** from earlier forms of social organization. Oppression
is the systematic imposition of inferior conditions of life on
particular groups of people.]{.underline} Members of an oppressed group
may be discriminated against economically, socially and/or politically.
Sometimes **[oppression has an economic impact; in some way, it
increases the capitalists' ability to exploit.]{.underline}** An obvious
example is discrimination against women or against a national or racial
minority. The [victims of such discrimination often receive lower
wages]{.underline} than other workers, so this [oppression adds directly
to capitalists' profits. **Capitalists gain a slightly more indirect
economic benefit from militarism and war.** Two world wars]{.underline}
in the 20th century [occurred primarily because the capitalists of the
major imperialist countries were competing for colonies]{.underline} and
semi-colonies, to monopolize the profits from them. [Today capitalists
are risking making the planet uninhabitable for much of the human race
because behaving differently might reduce their profits.]{.underline}
Political motives [Capitalism also maintains oppressions in which
profits are at most a very secondary consideration.]{.underline} The
economic benefits that capitalists seek from war and militarism are less
significant than their political role. [The military forces]{.underline}
maintained by imperialist countries like Australia are an ever present
threat to the peoples of the underdeveloped countries: "Step too far out
of line, don't do as you're told, and you'll have a fight on your hands
(in which we hold all the weapons)." These forces [**are also the
ultimate guarantee of capitalists' power in their own country:** that
is, they are intended for use against their own working people if they
get too far "out of line." Capitalists have to maintain a variety of
oppressions because they are a very small minority]{.underline} in any
society. If the exploited majority were to act together to put an end to
exploitation, they could very easily overcome the capitalists. For this
reason, the [capitalists have a very strong vested interest in
preventing the exploited majority from getting used to the idea of
working together]{.underline}---on almost anything. [**Oppression has a
political function for capitalism if it sets one section of the
exploited against another section**.]{.underline} Male union members who
think that a woman's "real" place is at home won't build a strong union.
Parents who are concerned about their children going to school with
immigrant children won't be raising demands on the government to provide
better education for everyone. [People who think that a neighboring
country's religion is dangerous to them **won't resist their own
government's militarism**.]{.underline} 188 Theoretical Exploration
Accounts of neoliberal state intervention tend to see the political
sphere as a separate moment of the capital relation. But, in reality,
[neoliberalism is an everchanging political expression of class rule
which mirrors the struggles occurring]{.underline} within the wider
reorganization of the social relations of capitalist production. Set
against the backdrop of the general crisis of capitalism, [neoliberalism
is made up of highly contradictory political and ideological projects
aimed at **ensuring the continued expansion of capital
accumulation,**]{.underline} especially in light of the tensions
involved in the broader dialectic between national and transnational
restructuring, that is, the tensions between deeper economic integration
and increased levels of competition (exploitation). Moreover, these new
political forms of class domination are not determined by a particular
instance, such as the market or the global economy; but shape, and are
in turn shaped by, class struggles associated with economic
restructuring. Consider these examples of alleged exploitation.

[It is important to focus on the systemic political-economic drivers of
capital mobility]{.underline} by dirty industry into disempowered
communities over the more narrow, legalistic definitions [that emphasize
corporate "intentions" to discriminate]{.underline}. It is not
necessarily anyone's intention to inflict harm upon working-class whites
or people of color when siting hazardous operations. [The primary goal
of capital is instead to seek out the cheap land,]{.underline} favorable
zoning laws[, less regulation]{.underline}, good infrastructure, [and a
community less likely to offer opposition]{.underline} (Wolverton 2012

Political Economy of Environmental Justice, edited by H. Spencer

[it is the legacy of systemic]{.underline} racism and [class
exploitation that creates]{.underline} such [self-reinforcing social
conditions in any given community]{.underline}. For instance, [ethnic
and racial minorities]{.underline} in the community [may have been
discriminated against by the banks]{.underline}, reducing home
ownership; [educational segregation]{.underline} may have left the
community's residents undereducated, [producing]{.underline} not just
"white flight" but "[class flight]{.underline}," as well and leaving
those remaining behind much less equipped to challenge a hazardous
siting; economic discrimination may have forced residents into low-wage
service jobs, requiring many to work multiple jobs and thus reducing
overall civic involvement that forms the basis of any public efforts to
resist a toxic hazard; [economic deprivation further makes the promise
of]{.underline} a handful of ([dangerous)]{.underline} new
[jobs]{.underline} [in the community difficult to resist;]{.underline}
racist voter redistricting and gerrymandering (the redrawing of
political district boundaries to favor a Party in power) may have robbed
the community of political power; and racist law enforcement and
prosecution might have incarcerated a whole generation of people who
would otherwise have the energy and drive to oppose such predations on
their homes and families. [These structural and systemic
political-economic conditions of racial capitalism make it logical for
polluting industry to locate operations in poor communities]{.underline}
of color and to do so without being overtly racist. Reactionary
neoliberalism is likely to deepen environmental injustices by initiating
measures that further prevent the mobility of the subaltern out of
environmentally contaminated communities. The Trump coalition of wealthy
white citizens tend to exercise greater control over community planning
processes, including the "exclusionary zoning" of dirty industries and
other locally unwanted land uses (LULUs). [Wealthier citizens
can]{.underline} also [better afford to out-migrate]{.underline} (white
flight) and purchase access to nicer neighborhoods, better schools and
housing, ecological amenities, and a cleaner environment (South and
Crowder 1997 South, Scott J., and Kyle D. Crowder. 1997. "Escaping

\[[the\] affluent can]{.underline} mobilize their economic power to
[secure environmental privilege for themselves]{.underline}, which can
include tasking other communities with disposing of their waste;
restricting the access of others to "natural" or beautiful spaces;
buffering such spaces from development or industrialization; and
enjoying the convenience of living in centrally located places from
which the less affluent have been priced out.

### ! -- Conflict 

#### Capitalism is unsustainable, makes conflict inevitable, and justifies the existence of the arms industry

Rudolf Hilferding was the first Marxist scholar to draw attention to the
emergence of finance capital as the dominant form of capital in the era
of monopolies, considered to be a new stage of capitalism. At this
point, [the separation between industrial capital and finance capital
that characterised the period of competitive capitalism
disappears]{.underline}. In the classic Finance Capital of 1910,
regarded as the greatest contribution to Marxist economics of its time
(Bottomore 1985: 1), [Hilferding considered the possibility that
capitalism could achieve a degree of organisation in which it was no
longer subject to production anarchy, thereby eliminating economic
crises]{.underline}. According to Hilferding, capitalism tended to
create cartels at all economic levels. **[Ultimately, a world cartel
would arise in which all capitalist production would be rigorously
planned by a superior body that would perfectly dictate the total amount
of goods to be produced and distributed in all fields]{.underline}**.
Economic planning would even reach a point where money2 would no longer
be necessary3 (Hilferding \[1910\] 1985: 226-7). **[By restricting
production, cartels could eliminate crises deriving from the
overproduction of commodities, but not the crises derived from the
overproduction of capital]{.underline}** (Hilferding \[1910\] 1985:
278). Hence, while cartels could change the character of economic
crises, they could not eliminate them entirely. Comparing the struggle
of industrial capital for more freedom with the mercantilist period,
Hilferding (\[1910\] 1985: 314) concluded that **[finance capital in the
imperialist stage hated the anarchy of competition]{.underline}**.
[Given its interconnected interests, it preferred organisation, only to
resume competition at a higher level]{.underline}.4 Nikolai Bukharin
(\[1915\] 1986) also argued that the global economy tended to become
highly organised at the stage of monopoly capitalism. In Imperialism and
World Economy, he stated: '[Imperialism is the policy of finance
capitalism, that is, of highly developed capitalism, which presupposes a
certain maturity -- very important in this case -- of the productive
organisation']{.underline} (Bukharin \[1915\] 1986: 128). According to
Bukharin, competition and conflict between capitalists would be
eliminated at the national level and transferred to the international
arena. Therefore, [there is a double movement in Bukharin's analysis in
which capital tends to internationalise on the one hand while
penetrating the state]{.underline} (state capitalism) [on the
other]{.underline}. **[In this view, this double movement is the main
contradiction of modern capitalism, and the cause of hostilities among
the great powers]{.underline}**: the central problem for Bukharin is not
economics, but war (Callinicos 2009: 57; Brewer 1990: 111). The
capitalist system tends to overcome production anarchy, and achieve
economic planning. It is not reaching its full organisational potential
only because the world is divided into national units (Howard and King
1989: 247). As Bukharin (\[1915\] 1986: 112) noted: [Competition reaches
its maximum development: the competition of national capitalist trusts
in the world market]{.underline}. Within the limits of national
economies, competition is minimised, to outgrow, beyond these limits, to
fantastic proportions, unknown in previous historical epochs. However,
as noted by Callinicos (2009: 62), **[if capitalism has become as highly
organised as Hilferding and Bukharin expected, why believe that this
would cease within national borders]{.underline}**? According to
Bukharin (\[1915\] 1986: 129) himself[, if national trusts could reach
an agreement, imperialism would indeed cease to exist. But this would
not be possible, for political and social reasons]{.underline}. The
necessary condition for such an agreement would include an equality
among trusts in the world market. Since this was not the case, the
trusts that held a more advantageous position -- at the strictly
economic level as well as the economic-political level (the association
of capital with the state) -- would have no interest in reaching such
agreements (Bukharin \[1915\] 1986: 130-131). Within the Marxist
tradition, [the notion that capitalism could organise itself to the
point of even eliminating inter-imperialist wars was proposed by Karl
Kautsky]{.underline}. Kautsky (1914, \[1913-1914\] 2002) argued that the
fundamental thrust of imperialism lay in the distortion between industry
and agriculture in capitalist economies. This was because [the impetus
towards capital accumulation and increased production was much stronger
in industry than in agriculture]{.underline}. [This greater investment
capacity of industry would cause tension in both sectors, since for
industry to continue growing, the agricultural sector needed to continue
supplying raw materials and food]{.underline}. Therefore, imperialism
was the consequence of highly developed industrial capitalism. But this
would not be a new stage of capitalist development, as Hilferding had
argued, but the preferred policy of finance capital.5 [States would be
forced to build large national industries in order to maintain their
independence, while largely agricultural economies would
decay]{.underline} (Kautsky \[1913-1914\] 2002: 457). In this
perspective, [there is a trend towards the occupation and subordination
of agrarian countries which causes a strong rivalry between industrial
countries, and consequently an arms race]{.underline}. Kautsky
(\[1913-1914\] 2002: 459) also argued that [advanced capitalist states
tended to block the industrialisation of agrarian countries in order to
prevent the emergence of competition]{.underline}.6 However, according
to Kautsky, the conflicts among the great powers over the exploitation
of agricultural regions could not continue. [The arms race and the costs
of colonial expansion would reach a level that would impede the very
process of accumulation, and ultimately capitalist
development]{.underline}. **[Therefore, there was no need to remain in a
state of war, as this would only contribute to a single capitalist
economic sector, namely the arms industry.]{.underline}** The domination
of large monopolies over the economies of imperialist nations led to the
renunciation of the arms race in favour of an alliance for peace. That
was why ['Every far-sighted capitalist must call out to his associates:
capitalists of all lands, unite']{.underline} (Kautsky \[1913-1914\]
2002: 460).7 [This implies that capitalism reaches a certain point of
development and organisation that attenuates its contradictions until
war becomes unnecessary]{.underline}. Kautsky referred to this level of
development in which there is a transfer of the cartelisation of the
economy of developed countries to the international arena as
'ultra-imperialism'.8 Thus, in relation to Hilferding and Bukharin,
[Kautsky maximised the organisational capacity of the system by
concluding that capitalist powers would reach an agreement allowing the
reproduction of capital in a peaceful manner throughout the
world]{.underline}. From the purely economic standpoint, however,
**[there is nothing further to prevent this violent explosion from
finally replacing imperialism by a holy alliance of the imperialists.
The longer the War lasts, the more it exhausts all tile]{.underline}**
\[sic\] parti[cipants and makes them recoil from an early repetition of
armed conflict, the nearer we come to this last solution, however
unlikely it may seem at the moment]{.underline} (Kautsky 1914). The
post-World War Two golden age of capitalism under US hegemony revived
the Kautskyan idea of an ultra-imperialism (Callinicos 2009: 63).
However, in Kautsky's terms, the conditions that would prevent a new
conflagration between the powers were not met. [There was never a
reduction in military expenses, and armed conflicts did occur in several
parts of the world, even after the Cold War, when the idea of the
organisation of capitalism reached its peak under the aegis of
'globalisation']{.underline}.

One hundred years ago, the great American socialist and revolutionary
Eugene Debs was thrown into a federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia
for denouncing the imperialists' bloody effort to re-divide the world in
World War One. Debs was legendary for his opposition to imperialism, and
uncompromising in his view of the class struggle, winning him the
support and admiration of millions of workers across the world. Debs
declared in 1915: " I have no country to fight for; my country is the
earth; and I am a citizen of the world . I am not a capitalist soldier;
I am a proletarian revolutionist. \... I refuse to obey any command to
fight from the ruling class, but I will not wait to be commanded to
fight for the working class." A century later, as [the **US wages war
all over the world** and **prepares ever greater wars**, WikiLeaks
publisher and journalist Julian Assange has been thrown into a British
jail cell for telling the truth about American war crimes.]{.underline}
He potentially faces charges in the US for violating the Espionage Act,
the very same law used against Debs. The "war to end war," [**World War
I**, in which **millions of young workers** were **sent to their

conflict** in **World War II**, in another bid to **re-divide** the
**world amongst** competing **capitalist** cliques.]{.underline} The
founder of our movement, Leon Trotsky wrote in 1928 that, ["In the
period of crisis the **hegemony** of the United States will **operate
more** completely, more openly, and more **ruthlessly** than in the
period of boom]{.underline} ... " This has been borne out as the
American ruling class has seen the dominant economic position it held in
the aftermath of World War II slip away. [The **US has waged a series of

in Iraq in 1990--91 and the war in Yugoslavia. For two decades, in what
Bush called the "[wars of the twenty-first century]{.underline}," the
[US invaded and occupied **Afghanistan** in 2001, followed by **Iraq**,
**Libya**, **Syria**, **Yemen** and **Somalia**. Entire societies have
been destroyed and at least one million people killed]{.underline}, with
millions more transformed into refugees seeking safe haven for
themselves and their families. Now, the so-called "[war on
terror]{.underline}" is being [transformed into a new great power
conflict]{.underline}. "Inter-state strategic competition, not
terrorism, is now the primary concern in US national security," Pentagon
war planners declared in last year's National Defense Strategy document.
[**China** and **Russia**, nuclear armed powers, are squarely in the
cross-hairs of the United States and its **imperialist allies** in
**Europe**, **Japan** and **Australia**, threatening a catastrophe for
humanity. The Trump administration's **reckless imperialist
provocation** in Venezuela, spearheaded by the mad war hawk John Bolton,
has been used to ratchet up **tensions** with Russia, China and
**Iran**. The historic conflict between the US and Europe, particularly
Germany, is again re-emerging. This new global conflict is being
prepared with a **massive military build-up** around the world. Global
military spending topped \$1.8 trillion last year, the **highest since**
the end of the **Cold War**.]{.underline} The US once again led the way
in 2018, spending \$649 billion on its military, as much as the next
eight countries combined, accounting for more than a third of the
world's military spending. [This **trend** is set to **continue**. Trump
has signed a \$686 billion budget for 2019 and is requesting \$718
billion for the Pentagon in 2020.]{.underline} The Congressional Budget
Office projects that if current funding trends continue, the US will
spend \$7 trillion on its military over the next decade, equivalent to
the amount that will be spent on education, infrastructure and public
health programs combined. [**Education**, **health care**, and **social
security** are being **starved of funding**, and wages suppressed, so
that **resources** can be **poured into the machines** of **death and
destruction**. Trillions are to be squandered on aircraft carriers,
fighter jets, hypersonic missiles and nuclear bombs, while we are told
there is **no money** to provide teachers with a high standard of living
or provide every student with a free **high-quality education**. This
immense military build-up is being **carried out with the support** of
all factions of the political establishment, **without** even a whiff of
**protest**. In fact, the **Democratic** Party's main critique of Trump
has been from the right, **demanding an even greater military build-up**
and a more aggressive posture toward Russia. In the American working
class, there is broad and overwhelming opposition to war.]{.underline}
Sixteen years ago, there were mass demonstrations in the US and around
the world over the bloody, illegal operation in Iraq. Pseudo-left forces
worked might and main to channel opposition to war behind the Democratic
Party. And what was the outcome? [Former President
**Obama**]{.underline}, the pioneer of drone assassinations, including
of American citizens, [**spent every day** of his administration **at
war.**]{.underline} Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laughed with glee
at the murder of Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi in 2011, and helped fuel
the devastating regime change war in Syria. Self-proclaimed democratic
socialist Bernie Sanders, currently running to be the Democrats'
presidential candidate in 2020, promised a foreign policy of "drones,
all that and more" when he ran for president in 2016. Assange and
whistleblower Chelsea Manning are being persecuted while those who
committed war crimes remain in positions of power, free to plan and
carry out new wars. But today there is growing working-class opposition
all over the world, from the mass protests in Algeria and Sudan, to the
yellow vests in France and teachers' strikes across the United States.
American workers watched as their brothers and sisters across the border
in Matamoros, Mexico rose up in a powerful strike movement earlier this
year. All around the world workers are fighting over the same issues
against the same transnational corporations. Last week 20,000 teachers
marched in the southern state of North Carolina in defence of public
education. One teacher told us that money was needed for minds, not land
mines. There is immense anger over the wars that are being carried out
in the name of the American people. [The emergence of the
**international class struggle** is breaking up all the efforts of the
trade unions, Trump and the Democrats to whip up American nationalism.
This is the **objective force** that will **break down** the efforts to
throw workers into **war** with each other.]{.underline} This movement,
still in its initial phases, must be armed with an international
socialist program. The fight to put an end to war is impossible without
fighting for socialism, [and the fight to **establish socialism** is not
possible without opposing war. Above all, the **fight against
imperialism** must be rooted in the struggles of the working
class.]{.underline} Criminality and gangsterism in foreign policy are
the flip side of parasitism and speculation in economic life. [The
international working class must, and will, take up on its banner the
**fight against imperialist** war, as part of the struggle to overthrow
the capitalist system and **establish** a socialist society based on
**equality**, **international unity**, and **peace**.]{.underline}

[Volcker justified his intervention by referring to the inflationary
trend that had to be interrupted]{.underline}---a trend allowing Third
World and Soviet bloc countries to industrialise or modernise by tapping
into Euro-capital markets recycling petrodollars after 1973. '[A great
world power,' he wrote at the time, 'does not want its policies,
international security or political objectives to be impeded by external
economic constraints']{.underline} (cited in Parboni 1981: 164). The
clampdown on global inflation has also been interpreted as a systemic
adjustment, imposing the discipline of capital on inflation-pegged wages
as well as on international credit that appeared to be bolstering the
enemies of the West (Gill 1990: 107). As we can see today, [the ant
inflation policy domestically worked to abrogate the class compromise
with organized labor, whilst subverting credit-financed Third
World/Soviet bloc industrialization plans internationally. One after
another, Poland and Yugoslavia, Mexico and Argentina, and so on, found
themselves confronted with vast debts to be serviced at high real
interest rates on dollar debts no longer subject to
inflation]{.underline} (Lipietz 1984). The systemic nature of the
intervention is brought out by the fact that the rate of profit on both
Anglo-French-German capital and US capital, which had been sliding
downward from 1965, rebounded in 1981-82 (Duménil and Lévy 2004: 35,
Fig. 3.3). [Sovereign debt is always a driver of further liberalization
and capitalist class formation, and this was not different in the
societies up to that point committed to state-led or -monitored economic
development]{.underline}. **[It allows the forcible opening up of entire
societies and their resource complexes for exploitation by capital from
creditor countries and local compradors. 'Public debt becomes one of the
most energetic levers of original accumulation']{.underline}** wrote
Marx in Capital, vol. I (MEW xxiii: 782). In the 1980s it served to
restore a balance which the previous decade had become tilted against
the West, and the decade ended with the collapse of the Soviet bloc and
with wars raging across the former Third World---in Africa, Angola and
Mozambique, in Central America, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, Iraq
and Iran already mentioned, and followed by the first Gulf War.
[Neoliberalism as it took shape in the class struggles initiated by
Thatcher and Reagan in the early 1980s and adopted by European
governments with some delay, thus was never a merely 'economic'
project]{.underline}. All [along it was accompanied by abrogating
relations of international compromise]{.underline}. For the era of the
Cold War and the non-aligned stance of a growing bloc of former colonies
and dependencies that lends meaning to the notion of a Third World, were
compromises, in which the West recognized the reality and by
implication, legitimacy, of the organization of blocs against it, just
as the capitalist class recognised the existence of organised labour.
[All negotiation through the era of what I call corporate liberalism
(roughly from the 1930s and 40s to the 1980s) was premised on the
sovereign equality of the other side. **It was this recognition that was
abandoned in neoliberalism**]{.underline}. Thus [the domestic class
compromise with labour was replaced by a compromise within the circuit
of money capital with middle classes profiting from the rise of rentier
incomes relative to wages]{.underline} (Epstein and Power 2002). In
Table 1 I sum up the characteristics of the two periods I distinguish
here. Although superficially, there was no letdown of violence over the
post-war period as a whole, the change in geopolitical framework from
the corporate liberal to the neoliberal epoch lends war a quality that
is different too. In the case of the former, there was always a limit on
the application of violence in the sense of a recognition of the rights
of the other side. The Vietnam war, although unprecedented in terms of
explosives used by the United States and its allies (twice the tonnage
of all fronts in World War II), never crossed the boundary where a
direct conflict with the USSR or China might have ensued---in that sense
Korea had drawn the boundary line for Asia that for Europe had been
explicitly agreed at Yalta. [Neoliberalism however was premised on an
overt strategy of destabilizing the USSR and the Soviet bloc, both by
exploiting the leverage of the 1980s debt crisis, or by actual military
provocations such as the Korean airline incident and assorted excursions
into the Soviet territorial waters of the Black Sea by US naval
units]{.underline} (e.g., Garthoff 1994: 269). **[The intricate
connections between neoliberalism and global governance, if necessary
pursued by military means, were part of the assemblage of the neoliberal
coalition in the crisis-ridden 1970s]{.underline}**. [During the Vietnam
years]{.underline} prime defence contractors already made profits above
the Fortune 500 average, but as Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler
document, **[the rate of profit of the 16 largest prime defense
contractors by the mid-seventies began another slow ascent that
accelerated to almost double the rate of the Vietnam average by
1985]{.underline}** (Nitzan and Bichler 1995: 462, Fig. 2). [This time
the arms bonanza was fueled from the Middle East]{.underline}, which
began accumulating surplus funds through oil price hikes (in response to
the uncoupling of the dollar gold that triggered the inflationary trend
terminated by the Volcker shock). As the region became more and more
militarized and oil income was translated into arms imports, Nitzan and
Bichler argue, [the interests of US arms exporters and transnational oil
companies converged on keeping the region in a state of tension---to the
point where they demonstrate that whenever the profit rate of the oil
companies fell below the average of the Fortune 500, a Middle East
energy conflict soon after put things right]{.underline} (Nitzan and
Bichler 1995: 499-500; cf. 496, Table 4). The element missing from this
analysis are the groups (elites, cliques) that represent such
objectively interlinked forces in the sphere of policy. These I would
argue are to be found among US supporters of the state of Israel, both
Zionists and Christian Zionists. They can be seen to have mediated and
on occasion, activated, the interconnection posited by Nitzan and
Bichler between Middle East 'energy conflicts', the big oil companies,
and the US military-industrial complex. With the election victory in
Israel of former Irgun terrorist leader Menachem Begin in 1977, the
military component of Western global governance was given a major boost.
The adverse conjuncture in the second half of the 1970s (expressed among
other things in a UN majority condemning Israel's racist character as a
'Jewish state') may have helped Begin's ascent, as did the occupation of
the West Bank, the Golan, and Gaza after the 1973 war with Egypt and
Syria. In the US the targeting of Israel pushed a large slice of the
traditionally left-leaning Jewish intelligentsia to what became known as
Neo-Conservatism.

#### Cap causes war

University Press, Chapter 8, pp. 184-186 //JSL

In its brief but bloody career, Marxism has involved a hideous amount of
violence. Both [Stalin and Mao Zedong were mass murderers]{.underline}
on an almost unimaginable scale. Yet [very few Marxists
today]{.underline}, as we have seen already, [would seek to defend these
horrific crimes, whereas many non-Marxists would defend, say, the
destruction of Dresden or Hiroshima]{.underline}. I have already argued
that [Marxists have offered far more persuasive explanations of how the
atrocities of men like Stalin came about, and thus how they can be
prevented from happening again, than any other school of
thought]{.underline}. But [what of the crimes of capitalism? What of the
atrocious bloodbath known as the First World War, in which the clash of
imperial nations hungry for territory sent working-class soldiers to a
futile death? **The history of capitalism is among other things a story
of global warfare, colonial exploitation, genocide and avoidable
famines**]{.underline}. If a distorted version of Marxism gave birth to
the Stalinist state, an extreme mutation of capitalism produced the
fascist one. [If a million men and women died in the Great Irish Famine
of the 1840s, it was]{.underline} to a large extent [because the British
government]{.underline} of the day [insisted on observing the laws of
the free market]{.underline} in its lamentable relief policy. We have
seen that Marx writes with scarcely suppressed outrage in Capital of the
bloody, protracted process by which the English peasantry were driven
from the land. It is this history of violent expropriation which lies
beneath the tranquillity of the English rural landscape. [Compared to
this horrendous episode, one which stretched over a lengthy period of
time, an event like the Cuban revolution was a tea party]{.underline}.

For Marxists, **[antagonism is built into the very nature of
capitalism]{.underline}**. [This is true not only of the class conflict
it involves, but of the wars to which it gives rise, as capitalist
nations clash over global resources or spheres of imperial
influence]{.underline}. By contrast, one of the most urgent goals of the
international socialist movement has been peace. When the Bolsheviks
came to power, they withdrew Russia from the carnage of the First World
War. Socialists, with their hatred of militarism and chauvinism, have
played a major role in most peace movements throughout modern history.
[The working-class movement has not been about violence, but about
putting an end to it.]{.underline}

### ! -- Unsustainable 

#### Capitalism is not sustainable -- an inherent drive to accumulate is inextricably linked to environmental collapse and means "green growth" can't function

**Monbiot '19** (George- Environmental and political advocate, Graduate
from Oxford, and published author, "Dare to declare capitalism dead --
before it takes us all down with it," The Guardian, April 25 2019)/ly

For most of my adult life I've railed against "corporate capitalism",
"consumer capitalism" and "crony capitalism". It took me a long time to
see that the problem is not the adjective but the noun. While some
people have rejected capitalism gladly and swiftly, I've done so slowly
and reluctantly. Part of the reason was that I could see no clear
alternative: unlike some anti-capitalists, I have never been an
enthusiast for state communism. I was also inhibited by its religious
status. To say "capitalism is failing" in the 21st century is like
saying "God is dead" in the 19th: it is secular blasphemy. It requires a
degree of self-confidence I did not possess. But as I've grown older,
I've come to recognise two things. First, that [it is the system, rather
than any variant]{.underline} of the system, [that drives us inexorably
towards disaster]{.underline}. Second, that [you do not have to produce
a definitive alternative to say that capitalism is failing]{.underline}.
The statement stands in its own right. But it also demands another, and
different, effort to develop a new system. [Capitalism's failures arise
from]{.underline} two of its defining elements. The first is [perpetual
growth]{.underline}. [Economic growth is the]{.underline} aggregate
[effect of the quest to accumulate capital and extract
profit]{.underline}. Capitalism collapses without growth, yet [perpetual
growth on a finite planet leads **inexorably to environmental
calamity.**]{.underline} [Those who defend capitalism argue
that]{.underline}, [as consumption switches from goods to services,
economic growth can be decoupled]{.underline} from the use of material
resources. Last week a paper in the journal New Political Economy, by
Jason Hickel and Giorgos Kallis, examined this premise. They found that
[while some relative decoupling took place]{.underline} in the 20th
century (material resource consumption grew, but not as quickly as
economic growth), [in the 21st century]{.underline} there has been a
recoupling: [rising resource consumption has so far matched or exceeded
the rate of economic growth]{.underline}. [The absolute decoupling
needed to avert environmental catastrophe]{.underline} (a reduction in
material resource use) has never been achieved, and [appears impossible
while economic growth continues]{.underline}. **[Green growth is an
illusion]{.underline}**. **[A system based on perpetual growth cannot
function without peripheries and externalities.]{.underline}** [There
must always be an extraction zone]{.underline} -- from which materials
are taken without full payment -- [and a disposal zone,]{.underline}
where costs are dumped in the form of waste and pollution. [As the scale
of economic activity increases until capitalism affects
everything]{.underline}, from the atmosphere to the deep ocean floor,
[the entire planet becomes a sacrifice zone]{.underline}: [we all
**inhabit the periphery of the profit-making machine.**]{.underline}
This drives us towards cataclysm on such a scale that most people have
no means of imagining it. [The **threatened collapse** of our
life-support systems **is bigger** by far than war, famine, pestilence
or economic crisis,]{.underline} though it is likely to incorporate all
four. Societies can recover from these apocalyptic events, but not from
the loss of soil, an abundant biosphere and a habitable climate. [The
second defining element is the bizarre assumption that a person is
entitled to as great a share of the world's natural wealth as their
money can buy.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} seizure of common goods
[causes]{.underline} three further dislocations. First, [the scramble
for exclusive control of non-reproducible assets]{.underline}, [which
implies]{.underline} either [violence]{.underline} or legislative
truncations of other people's rights. Second, [the immiseration of other
people by an economy based on looting across both space and
time]{.underline}. [Third, the translation of economic power into
political power]{.underline}, as control over essential resources leads
to control over the social relations that surround them.

#### Capitalism is unsustainable and reforms fail---only a radical shift to can solve 

**Foster 19** (John, PhD from York University, Professor at the

Failed---What Next?," Monthly Review, 2/1/19,

JLin)

What Next? In his magisterial The Age of Extremes: A History of the
World 1914--1991, Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, viewing [the approach
of the twenty-first century, indicated that there were reasons to be
concerned that the **new century might be even more threatening to
humanity than the "age of extremes**]{.underline}" that had preceded it,
a century that had been punctuated by world wars, imperial conflicts,
and economic depressions---and in which [humanity was confronted for the
first time with the possibility of its own
self-annihilation.]{.underline} Yet, looking forward, he concluded, the
new century (and millennium) offered even greater dangers. "[We live in
a world]{.underline}," Hobsbawm observed in 1994, [uprooted and
**transformed by the titanic economic and the techno-scientific process
of the development of capitalism**]{.underline}, which has dominated the
past two or three centuries. [We know, or at least it is reasonable to
suppose, that it cannot go on ad infinitum. The future cannot be a
continuation of the past]{.underline}, and there are [signs, both
externally, and]{.underline}, as it were, [internally, that we have
reached a point of historic crisis.]{.underline} The **[forces generated
by the techno-scientific economy are now great enough to destroy the
environment]{.underline}**, that is to say, the material foundations of
human life. The [structures of human societies themselves, including
even some of the social foundations of the capitalist economy, are on
the point of being destroyed by the erosion of what we have inherited
from the human past.]{.underline} Our world risks both explosion and
implosion. It must change. We do not know where we are going. We only
know that history has brought us to this point and---if readers share
the argument of this book---why. However, one thing is plain. [If
humanity is to have a recognizable future, **it cannot be by prolonging
the past or the present.**]{.underline} If we try to build the third
millennium on that basis, we shall fail. And [the price of failure, that
is to say, the alternative to a changed society, is
darkness]{.underline}.85 Hobsbawm left little doubt as to what the
principal danger was at present, namely "the theological faith in an
economy in which resources were allocated entirely by the totally
unrestricted market, under conditions of unlimited competition," carried
out by evermore-concentrated corporations. [Chief among the dangers of
such a system was the likelihood of "irreversible and catastrophic
consequences for the natural environment of this planet]{.underline},
including the human race which is part of it."86 Hobsbawm's position was
roundly criticized at the time, even by many on the left, as overly
"pessimistic" with regard to the course of capitalist development.87
Today, however, a quarter-century later, it is clear that he hit the
mark, as the concerns that he voiced then are even more evident today.
Nevertheless, [such realism in approaching the failure of capitalism in
our time is still rare on the part of left intellectuals in the wealthy
countries, even in]{.underline} the face of [decades of neoliberal
assault combined with economic stagnation, financialization, growing
inequality, and environmental decline]{.underline}. One common response
is to refer to Polanyi's notion of a double movement, in which the
recurring myth of a self-regulating market society inevitably gives rise
to defensive movements to protect society and the environment.88 This
has fed the hope that the pendulum will swing back again, leading to a
more affirmative-style liberalism or social democracy. [This sustains
the belief that the **failures of unregulated capitalism can be
countered by a return to regulated capitalism**]{.underline}, a new
Keynesian age---as if history had stood still. [Pinning hopes on a
double movement of this kind, however, denies four material realities.
First, social democracy came about]{.underline} and persisted [only as
long as the threat of actually existing socialist societies was present
and union strength endured,]{.underline} and faded immediately with the
demise of both. Second, **[neoliberalism today is ingrained in
capitalism itself, in the phase of monopoly-financial
capital]{.underline}**. The earlier [age of industrial-capital
dominance]{.underline}, on which Keynesian economics was based, [is now
gone.]{.underline} Third, [social democracy was in practice reliant on
an imperialist system that was opposed to the interests of the vast
majority of humankind]{.underline}. Fourth, the [liberal-democratic
state and the dominance of a purportedly enlightened
industrial-capitalist class willing to engage in a social accord with
labor is largely a relic of the past,]{.underline} with its structural
bases having all but disappeared. [Even when social democratic parties
come to power in these circumstances, promising to work within the
system and create a kinder and gentler capitalism, **they invariably
fall prey to the laws of motion of capitalism in this
phase.**]{.underline} As Michael Yates writes, in the context of a
failed capitalism: "Today, it is impossible to believe that there will
be a recovery of even the modest political and economic project that
labor unions and political parties once embraced and helped bring to
fruition."89 On the so-called liberal-left, some have adopted a broad
technological-modernization approach, largely disregarding social
relations. Here, in an implicit technological determinism, digital
technology, social engineering, and wise liberal management are expected
to reign supreme. It is true, such thinkers argue, [**that the
capitalist absolutism of neoliberalism points to unending
disaster**.]{.underline} But capitalism can be altered, presumably from
above, to fit any exigency, even the sidelining of profits and
accumulation, conforming to current technological imperatives. What will
remain of the system, in this conception, will be the bare frames of
corporations and markets now devoid of any class or acquisitive drive,
mere engines of efficiency. As Jørgen [Randers,]{.underline} one of the
original Limits to Growth authors, [declares in 2052---his forecast (in
2012) of the world society forty years into the future---that the
"modified capitalism" that will emerge mid--point in this century "will
be a system wherein collective well-being is set above the return of the
individual."]{.underline} Modified capitalism will be subject to the
guidance of "wise government," directed by technocrats, while being
characterized by "less democracy and less market freedom." Rather than
directly facing up to the failures of capitalism---[though he projects
forty years of economic stagnation for the major economic powers and
continued poverty in the "rest of the world]{.underline}"---Randers sees
such questions as largely irrelevant to his vision of the world in 2052.
The dominant reality, he predicts, will be a more efficient and
sustainable, if more physically constrained, version of the present-day
capitalist world.90 [Yet, in the barely seven years since his book was
written, it is already clear that **Randers's predictions were wrong in
every respect**]{.underline}. [The situation confronting the world is
qualitatively more serious than it was in 2012,]{.underline} at a time
when gradualist, **[technocratic solutions to climate change still
seemed feasible]{.underline}** to many even among those on the left and
when the liberal-democratic state appeared perfectly stable. **[Today,
in the context of accelerated climate change, continuing economic
stagnation, political upheaval, and growing geopolitical instability, it
is clear that the challenges that the world is facing will be both more
cataclysmic and epoch-making than progressive ecological
modernizers]{.underline}** like Randers envisioned. The choices
confronting us are now much harder. Indeed, history has been unkind to
all such attempts to provide detailed forecasts of the future,
particularly if they simply extend current trends and leave the bulk of
humanity and their struggles out of the picture. It is for this reason
that a dialectical view is so important. The actual course of history
can never be predicted. The only thing certain about historical change
is the existence of the struggles that drive it forward and that
guarantee its discontinuous character. [Both implosions and explosions
inevitably materialize, rendering the world for new generations
different than that of the old. History points to numerous social
systems that have reached the limits of their ability to adapt their
social relations to allow for the rational and sustainable use of
developing productive forces.]{.underline} Hence, the human past is
dotted by periods of regression, followed by revolutionary accelerations
that sweep all before them. As the conservative historian Jacob
Burckhardt declared in the nineteenth century, "a historical crisis"
occurs when "a crisis in the whole state of things is produced,
involving whole epochs and all or many peoples of the same
civilization.... The historical process is suddenly accelerated in
terrifying fashion. Developments which otherwise take centuries seem to
flit by like phantoms in months or weeks, and are fulfilled." He called
this the "acceleration of historical processes."91 Burckhardt
principally had in mind social revolutions, like the French Revolution
of 1789. This was an acceleration of history that, as the modern French
historian Georges Lefebvre explained, commenced as a series of widening
revolutions, mutating with terrifying speed, from an aristocratic
revolution to a bourgeois revolution to a popular revolution and then a
peasant revolution---finally taking on the character of a historic
"bloc, a single thing," seemingly unconquerable, which reshaped much of
world history.92 Could such a revolutionary acceleration of history,
though on an incomparably greater scale, happen in the twenty-first
century? Most establishment commentators in the hegemonic countries of
the world imperialist system would say no, based on their own narrow
experience and limited view of history. Nevertheless[, revolutions
continue to break out in the periphery of the world system and are, even
now, only put down by imperialist economic, political, and military
interventions]{.underline}. Moreover, the [failure of capitalism on a
planetary scale today threatens all of civilization and life on the
planet as we know it.]{.underline} If drastic changes are not made,
global temperature this century will increase by 4° or even 6°C from
preindustrial times, leading to conditions that will imperil humankind
as a whole. Meanwhile, the [extreme capitalism of today seeks to
expropriate and enclose all the bases of material
existence,]{.underline} siphoning off almost the entire net social
surplus and robbing the natural environment for the direct benefit of a
miniscule few. [As a direct result of capitalist social relations, the
material challenges now facing humanity are greater than anything ever
seen before, pointing to an accumulation of catastrophe along with the
accumulation of capital]{.underline}.93 Hundreds of millions of people
under these circumstances are already being drawn into struggles with
the system, creating the basis of a new worldwide movement toward
socialism. In his book Can the Working Class Change the World? Yates
answers yes, it can. But it can only do so through a unifying struggle
by workers and peoples aimed at genuine socialism.94 It may be objected
that socialism has been tried and has failed and hence no longer exists
as an alternative. However, like the earliest attempts at capitalism in
the Italian city-states of the late Middle Ages, which were not strong
enough to survive amongst the feudal societies that surrounded them, the
failure of the first experiments at socialism presage nothing but its
eventual rebirth in a new, more revolutionary, more universal form,
which examines and learns from the failures.95 [Even in failure,
socialism has this advantage over capitalism: it is motivated by the
demand for "freedom in general," rooted in substantive equality and
sustainable human development]{.underline}---reflecting precisely those
collective social relations, borne of historical necessity and the
unending struggle for human freedom, crucial to human survival in our
time.96 The great conservative economist Joseph Schumpeter, who, as
Austrian finance minister in Red Vienna, had allied himself for a time
with the socialist government and found himself attacked on all sides,
once wrote that [capitalism would perish not because of "the weight of
economic failure," but rather because its "very success" in pursuing its
narrow economic ends, had undermined the sociological foundations of its
existence.]{.underline} Capitalism, Schumpeter exclaimed, "'inevitably'
creates conditions in which it will not be able to live and which
strongly point to socialism as its heir apparent."97 He was, it turns
out, in many ways correct, though not entirely in the way he expected.
The global development of monopoly capitalism and financialization
spearheaded by the very same counterrevolutionary neoliberalism that
first arose in response to Red Vienna in the interwar years---at a time
when Schumpeter himself was a major actor---has now undermined the
material bases, not so much of capitalism itself, but of global society
and planetary ecology. The result has been the emergence of an
"atmosphere of almost universal hostility" to the prevailing social
order, though, playing out in the confused context of the present, less
as opposition to capitalism itself than to neoliberalism.98 It is
capitalism's undermining of the very basis of human existence that will
eventually compel the world's workers and peoples to seek new roads
forward. An inclusive, class-based movement toward socialism in this
century will open up the possibility of qualitative new developments
that the anarchy of the capitalist-market society with its monopolistic
competition, extreme inequality, and institutionalized greed cannot
possibly offer.99 This includes the development of a socialist
technology, in which both the forms of technology utilized and the
purposes to which they are put are channeled in social directions, as
opposed to individual and class gain.100 It introduces the prospect of
long-term democratic planning at all levels of society, allowing
decisions to be made and distributions to occur outside the logic of the
cash nexus.101 Socialism, in its most radical form, is about substantive
equality, community solidarity, and ecological sustainability; it is
aimed at the unification---not simply division---of labor. [Once
**sustainable human development, rooted not in exchange values, but in
use values and genuine human needs, comes to define historical
advance**, the future]{.underline}, which now seems closed, [will open
up]{.underline} in a myriad ways, allowing for entirely new, more
qualitative, and collective forms of development.102 This can be seen in
the kinds of needed practical measures that could be taken up, but which
are completely excluded under the present mode of production. It is not
physical impossibility, or lack of economic surplus, most of which is
currently squandered, that stands in the way of the democratic control
of investment, or the satisfaction of basic needs---clean air and water,
food, clothing, housing, education, health care, transportation, and
useful work---for all. [It is not the shortage of technological know-how
or of material means that prevents the necessary ecological
conversion]{.underline} to more sustainable forms of energy.103 [It is
not some inherent division of humanity]{.underline} that obstructs the
construction of a New International of workers and peoples directed
against capitalism, imperialism, and war.104 [All of this is within our
reach**, but requires pursuing a logic that runs counter to that of
capitalism.**]{.underline} Humanity, Karl Marx wrote, "inevitably sets
itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination
will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material
conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the
course of formation."105 The very waste and excess of today's
monopoly-finance capitalism, together with the development of new means
of communication that allow for greater human coordination, planning,
and democratic action than ever before, suggest that there are countless
paths forward to a world of substantive equality and ecological
sustainability once the world is freed from the fetters of capital.106
The [answers to the crises before us are both social and ecological.
They require the **rational regulation of the metabolism between human
beings and nature under the control of associated
humanity**]{.underline}---[regenerating and maintaining the flows,
cycles, and other vital processes of healthy, local, regional, and
global ecosystems]{.underline} (and species habitats)---in accord with
the needs of the entire chain of human generations. The [mainsprings of
human action throughout history lie in the drive for human freedom and
the struggle to master our relation to the world]{.underline}. The first
of these ultimately demands equality and community; the second, human
development and sustainability. It is on these struggles for collective
advancement that we must ultimately rely if humanity is to have a future
at all.

activities [[that]{.mark} eventually [result
in]{.mark} a [restabilization]{.mark} of the system [and
renewed]{.mark} capitalist [expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The
current crisis shares aspects of earlier system-wide structural
crises]{.underline}, such as of the 1880s, the 1930s or the 1970s.
But [[there are]{.mark} six interrelated [dimensions to the current
crisis that]{.mark}]{.underline} I believe [[**sets it
apart** from]{.mark} these [earlier ones and suggests that]{.mark} a
simple [restructuring]{.mark} of the system [will not lead]{.mark} to
its [restabilization]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that is, [our very survival
now requires a revolution against global
capitalism]{.underline} (Robinson,
2014). [[These]{.mark} six [dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline}, in broad
strokes, [[present a]{.underline}]{.mark} "[big picture]{.underline}"
[[context in which a **global police state** is
emerging]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, [[the system]{.mark} is
fast [reaching the **ecological
limits** of]{.mark} its **[reproduction]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[We
have already passed tipping points]{.underline}**]{.mark}[ in climate
change]{.underline}, [the nitrogen cycle]{.underline}, [and diversity
loss]{.underline}. [For the first time ever]{.underline}, [[human
conduct]{.mark} is intersecting with and fundamentally altering the
earth system in such a way that [threatens to bring]{.mark} about a
sixth **[mass extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see, e.g., Foster et
al., 2011; Moore, 2015). These ecological dimensions of global crisis
have been brought to the forefront of the global agenda by the worldwide
environmental justice movement. Communities around the world have come
under escalating repression as they face off against transnational
corporate plunder of their environment. While capitalism cannot be held
solely responsible for the ecological crisis, [[it is difficult
to]{.mark} imagine that the environmental catastrophe can be [resolved
within]{.mark} the [capitalist system given]{.mark} capital's implacable
impulse to accumulate and [its]{.mark} accelerated **[commodification of
nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Second, [the level
of [global]{.mark} social [polarization and inequality
is **unprecedented**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The richest one percent of
humanity in 2016 controlled over half of the world's wealth and 20
percent controlled 95 percent of that wealth, while the remaining 80
percent had to make do with just five percent (Oxfam,
2017). [These [escalating inequalities fuel capitalism's]{.mark} chronic
problem of [overaccumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}: [the TCC [cannot
find]{.mark} productive [outlets to unload]{.mark} the enormous amounts
of [surplus]{.mark} it has accumulated]{.underline}, [[leading
to]{.mark} chronic [**stagnation** in
the]{.mark} world [economy]{.mark}]{.underline} (see next section).
Such [extreme levels of social [polarization present a
challenge]{.mark} of social control [to dominant
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Trumpism in the United States as well as
the rise of far-right and neo-fascist movements in Europe so well
illustrate, [[cooptation]{.mark} also [involves]{.mark} the **[manipulation
of fear]{.mark}** and insecurity [among the downwardly mobile
so]{.mark} that **[social anxiety is channeled towards scapegoated
communities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This psychosocial mechanism of
displacing mass anxieties]{.underline} is not new, but it [appears to be
increasing around the world in the face of the structural
destabilization of capitalist
globalization.]{.underline} Extreme [[inequality requires extreme
violence and repression that lend themselves to projects of 21st
century **fascism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Third, [the sheer magnitude of
the means of violence and social control is
unprecedented]{.underline},[as well as the magnitude and [concentrated
control over]{.mark} the means of [global communication]{.mark} and the
production and circulation of symbols, images, and
knowledge.]{.underline} Computerized wars, drone warfare, robot
soldiers, bunker-buster bombs, a new generation of nuclear weapons,
satellite surveillance, cyberwar, spatial control technology, and so
forth, have changed the face of warfare, and more generally, of systems
of social control and repression. [[**We have arrived at the
panoptical** surveillance **society**]{.underline},]{.mark} a point
brought home by Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013, and the age of
thought control by those who control global flows of communication and
symbolic production. [[If global capitalist crisis leads to a new
world war the destruction
would simply be **unprecedented**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fourth, [**[we
are reaching limits]{.mark}** to the extensive expansion of
capitalism]{.underline}, in the sense that [there are no longer any new
territories of significance to integrate into world capitalism and
new [spaces to commodify are drying up]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
The capitalist system is by its nature expansionary. In each earlier
structural crisis, the system went through a new round of extensive
expansion -- from waves of colonial conquest in earlier centuries, to
the integration in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of the former
socialist countries, China, India and other areas that had been
marginally outside the system. [**[There are no longer]{.mark}** any
[new **territories to integrate**]{.mark} into world
capitalism.]{.underline} [At the same
time]{.underline}, [the [privatization]{.mark} of
education]{.underline}, health, utilities, basic services, and public
lands [[is]{.mark} [turning]{.mark} those spaces in [global
society]{.mark} that were outside of capital's
control [into]{.mark}]{.underline}[ "[spaces of
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}," [so that intensive expansion is reaching
depths never before seen]{.underline}. What is there left to commodify?
Where can the system now expand? New spaces have to be violently cracked
open and the peoples in these spaces must be repressed by the global
police state. Fifth, there is the rise of a vast surplus population
inhabiting a "planet of slums" (Davis, 2007) pushed out of the
productive economy, thrown into the margins, and subject to
sophisticated systems of social control and to destruction, into a
mortal cycle of dispossession-exploitation-exclusion. Crises provide
capital with the opportunity to accelerate the process of forcing
greater productivity out of fewer workers. The processes by which
surplus labor is generated have accelerated under globalization. Spatial
reorganization has helped transnational capital to break the
territorial-bound power of organized labor and impose new capital--labor
relations based on fragmentation, flexibilization, and the cheapening of
labor. These developments, combined with a massive new round of
primitive accumulation and displacement of hundreds of millions, have
given rise to a new global army of superfluous labor that goes well
beyond the traditional reserve army of labor that Marx
discussed. [[Global **capitalism has no** direct **use for surplus
humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But indirectly, it holds wages down
everywhere and makes new systems of 21st century slavery possible.
Dominant groups face the challenge of how to contain both the real and
potential rebellion of surplus humanity. In addition, surplus humanity
cannot consume and so as their ranks expand the problem of
overaccumulation becomes exacerbated. Sixth, [there is an acute
political contradiction in global capitalism: economic [globalization
takes places within a nation-state system]{.mark} of political
authority]{.underline}. [[Transnational state apparatuses]{.mark} are
incipient and [have not been able to]{.mark} substitute for a leading
nation-state with enough power]{.underline} and authority [to organize
and **[stabilize the system]{.mark}**]{.underline}, much less to impose
regulations on transnational capital. In the age of capitalist
globalization governments must attract to the national territory
transnational corporate investment, which requires providing capital
with all the incentives associated with neoliberalism -- downward
pressure on wages, deregulation, austerity, and so on -- that aggravate
inequality, impoverishment, and insecurity for working classes.
Nation-states face a contradiction between the need to promote
transnational capital accumulation in their territories and their need
to achieve political legitimacy. As a result, states around the world
have been experiencing spiraling crises of legitimacy. This situation
generates bewildering and seemingly contradictory politics and also
helps explain the resurgence of far-right and neo-fascist forces that
espouse rhetoric of nationalism and protectionism even as they promote
neo-liberalism.

#### Their claims of sustainability are inherently biopolitical -- they're locked in a system of neoliberal extraction centered around governmentality

Over the past decade, the global conservation movement has increasingly
embraced 'natural capital accounting' (NCA) as a key strategy for
environmental protection. Through an intricate web of partnerships,
states, private-sector firms and non-governmental organizations ([NGOs)
have developed a variety of initiatives intended to assign economic
value to 'ecosystem ser- vices' that are then supposed to be maintained
through appropriate pricing and preservation as 'natural
capital']{.underline} (Sullivan 2013, 2017a). In this way, NCA 'aspires
to incorporate all aspects of valued external nature within accounting
practices' consonant 'with the contemporary market economy' (Sullivan
2017b, 397). This campaign rests on the assumption that if natural
resources can be valued financially, a critical mass of people -- from
global policy- makers to local resource users -- will be motivated to
defend them.∂ [NCA is part of a widespread trend toward
neoliberalization within conservation govern- ance evident throughout
the world]{.underline} (Büscher, Dressler, and Fletcher 2014). [This
trend pro- motes market-based instruments (MBIs) for environmental
management]{.underline} (e.g. ecotourism, payment for environmental
services and carbon markets) to incentivize 'stakeholders' to favor
conservation over resource extraction. Strong concerns have been raised
about this strategy, questioning its reduction of environmental value to
narrow economic measures (Büscher and Fletcher 2015), its contribution
to 'green grabbing' (Fairhead, Leach, and Scoones 2012) and how actual
investments in MBIs have lagged far behind their lofty promises (Dempsey
and Suarez 2016). Yet while the vision underlying NCA pro- motion has
been explored in various ways by ecological economists (e.g. Jansson
1994; Costanza et al. 1997, 2014) and others (Dempsey 2016; Sullivan
2017a, 2017b), how this vision is currently materializing within
on-the-ground policy and practice has yet to be sys- tematically
investigated. As NCA is frequently introduced into frontier areas
harboring rural, resource-dependent populations, investigating NCA's
impacts in the context of rapidly intensifying agrarian transformations
remains critically important.∂ Here we explore two cases in which NCA
has been introduced to support biodiversity conservation and carbon
sequestration in frontier Southeast Asia through the lens of Fou-
caultian biopolitics. While conservation governance has been previously
analyzed as a form of biopower (Biermann and Mansfield 2014), such
analysis has not yet engaged with Foucault's recently published
discussion of a specifically neoliberal biopolitics. We argue that [NCA
represents the intensification of a neoliberal biopolitics in which the
central aim to nurture and sustain life is sought via incentives that
emphasize nonhuman life's potential to contribute to economic
growth]{.underline} (termed 'green growth' within NCA par- lance). We
conclude that while NCA can strongly influence local behaviors and
livelihood changes (Dressler 2014), in practice its effects usually
remain partial and fragmented.∂ Indeed, our findings suggest that
**[rather than incentivizing conservation, NCA may more commonly
encourage precisely its opposite: the expansion of resource-extractive
activities that threaten conservation]{.underline}**. By encouraging
local resource users to further embrace market logic for natural
resource valuation while failing to deliver sufficient revenue to make
in situ biodiversity preservation more valuable than lucrative
extractive practices (e.g. mining, oil palm), [NCA may in practice lead
local communities to shift to more destructive resource uses, and
ultimately to embrace conventional extractivism]{.underline}.∂ We first
introduce our conceptual framework and outline the recent rise of NCA
among conservationists. We then apply our framework to our empirical
case studies. We demon- strate that while NCA can facilitate livelihood
changes, the rhetoric and range of incentives on offer commonly misalign
with local livelihoods and create conditions leading local farmers to
instead embrace more exploitative options. We conclude by highlighting
the implications of our analysis for future investigation concerning NCA
within the context of neoliberal conservation, biopolitics and landscape
change.∂ The analysis is based on long-term ethnographic research in the
Philippines and Indo- nesia by Dressler and Anderson, respectively. Data
collection for the Philippines ran from 2008 to 2016, and that in
Indonesia from 2013 to 2016. In both areas this entailed semi-
structured interviews with key NGO, government and community
organization represen- tatives as well as participant observation and
focus group discussions with rural farmers. We spent weeks in homes and
fields, documenting past and present farming practices (e.g. swidden) as
well as responses to and outcomes (both socio-economic and biophysi-
cal) of NCA interventions. Data analysis focused most on patterns of
response within and between interviews. The corresponding researchers
are conversant in Filipino (Tagalog) and Bahasa Indonesian and used
local translators when Pala'wan and Dayak languages were spoken. All
informants gave informed consent, and all areas and respondent names are
pseudonyms.∂ Neoliberal biopolitics∂ Foucault introduced
'biopower/biopolitics' to describe the historical change from the pre-
modern sovereign's prerogative to 'take life or let live' to the modern
state's claim to 'make live and to let die' (2003, 241). While Foucault
himself focused on the exercise of biopower in defense of human
populations, others have extended the concept to analyze diverse
phenomena (Lemke 2011; Mendieta 2014), including forms of environmental
governance in defense of nonhumans, such as protected area enforcement
(Luke 1999; Youatt 2008; Fletcher 2010; Cavanagh 2014).∂ What remains
underexplored within this growing literature on environmental
biopolitics, however, are the different ways in which biopower can be
exercised. Initially, Fou- cault (1978, 2003) described biopower as
largely synonymous with the 'governmentality' analytic he developed
simultaneously, in that both addressed power exercised at the level of
(national) populations rather than over a collection of subjects or
discrete individuals. This resulted in the famous
'sovereignty--discipline--government' triad (Foucault 1991, 102) that
inspired the now-massive governmentality literature (Rose, O'Malley, and
Valverde 2006; Lemke 2012). Yet in subsequent lectures Foucault (2007,
2008) reworked the govern- mentality concept, such that it
'progressively shifts from a precise, historically determinate sense, to
a more general and abstract meaning' (Sennellart 2007, 388) encompassing
various strategies for the 'conduct of conduct'. In the process,
'[discipline' ceases to be opposed to 'government' but becomes instead
one of several forms of an expanded governmentality]{.underline}.∂ In
The birth of biopolitics, Foucault (2008) distinguishes 'disciplinary'
and 'neoliberal' modes of governmentality (cf. Fletcher 2010). While
disciplinary governmentality seeks to propagate social norms and ethical
standards compelling individual conformance due to fears of appearing
deviant or immoral, a neoliberal governmentality aims to create external
incentive structures within which subjects can be influenced through
manipulation of incentives. Neoliberal governmentality thus constitutes
'an environmental type of intervention instead of the internal
subjugation of individuals'; 'a governmentality which will act on the
environment and systematically modify its variables' (Foucault 2008,
260, 271).∂ Importantly, [disciplinary and neoliberal modes of
governmentality can also be under- stood to prescribe divergent (yet
overlapping) strategies for the exercise of (bio)power.]{.underline} In
Foucault's early analysis, disciplinary techniques function as one of
the principal means by which the (emerging modern) state exercised
biopower, allowing for the manipulation of individuals' behavior in
pursuit of an optimized human existence. [The subsequent rise of
neoliberalism]{.underline}, he suggested, [introduced a novel approach
to biopower, prescribing different strategies for influencing subjects'
attitudes and behavior]{.underline}. While Foucault did not develop this
idea of a neoliberal biopower further, a nascent body of literature has
begun to do so (see esp. Lemm and Vatter 2014). Thus far, this analy-
sis has not been systematically applied to environmental governance,
although Fletcher (2010) speculates concerning how neoliberal biopower
might manifest within conserva- tion politics specifically. He suggests
that∂ a [neoliberal perspective would likely focus less on subjects'
internal states than on the external structures within which they act
\... interventions would be framed less in terms of morality than
cost--benefit characteristics \... \[and\] \... would likely place less
emphasis on nurturing and sustaining life directly than on supporting
economic growth.]{.underline} (2010, 175)∂ Building on this, we explore
how neoliberal biopolitics manifests within contemporary conservation
governance in remote frontier settings.∂ In the process, we contribute
to the study of neoliberal conservation in conjunction with agrarian
change. While neoliberal conservation has been analyzed extensively
(Igoe and Brockington 2007; Büscher et al. 2012; Büscher, Dressler, and
Fletcher 2014, Holmes and Cavanagh 2016), the lens of biopolitics adds a
productive new dimension by focusing on how neoliberal interventions
seek to optimize rural peoples' valuation and use of the resources in
question. While previous conservation governance tended to foreground
ethical concerns and hence pursue the creation of 'environmental
subjects -- people who care about the environment' (Agrawal 2005, 162),
[contemporary interven- tions often minimize such concerns, seeking to
instead promote decision-making via economic valuation. Here,
stakeholders are encouraged to behave as 'rational actors \[who\] can be
motivated to exhibit appropriate behaviors through manipulation of
incen- tives']{.underline} (Fletcher 2010, 173). This demands a
different perspective, one that the concept of neoliberal biopolitics
facilitates.∂ We do not claim that neoliberal biopower necessarily
displaces other processes entirely, as different forms of biopower may
'overlap, lean on each other, challenge each other, and struggle with
each other' (Foucault 2008, 313). As our case studies demonstrate, a
disci- plinary biopolitics may thus continue to be promoted alongside
neoliberal interventions. Indeed, a certain mode of the former may
underpin the latter, in that the inculcation of a neoliberal orientation
often necessitates disciplining to produce the rational actors con-
sidered capable of appropriately evaluating incentives.∂ We also
acknowledge that aspects of neoliberal (or other forms of) biopower
promoted via environmental governance are seldom wholly internalized by
target populations. Analysis from the perspective of
governmentality/biopower, after all, tends to be less con- cerned with
'what happened and why' than 'to start by asking what authorities of
various sorts wanted to happen' Rose (1999, 20). Whether this intention
is actually realized is explored by a body of research investigating the
correspondence between 'vision' and 'execution' in environmental
governance (see Carrier and West 2009; Anderson et al. 2016). Dempsey
and Suarez (2016), moreover, demonstrate that despite worldwide pro-
motion of neoliberal conservation over the past decades, very little
actual market exchange has taken place thus far, while most trade that
does occur has been directed by states. They thus describe 'free' market
transactions among private parties as 'slivers of slivers of slivers' of
general financial transactions (Dempsey and Suarez 2016, 654).∂ Yet
earlier research suggests that while finances often do not flow from
direct market transactions per se, significant funds do manifest by way
of project delivery, infrastructure development, accounting and
monitoring activities and, crucially, the various incentives and
conditions intended to convert rural residents into environmental
defenders (Dressler 2014). Indeed, as Dempsey and Suarez point out, in
failing to develop substantial markets conservation mechanisms may still
function 'to reinforce neoliberal political rationalities among
conservationists' and local stakeholders (2016, 655). To what extent
this actually succeeds in creating the envisioned (eco)rational subjects
is an empirical question, one that animates our analysis below.∂ The
rise of natural capital∂ While having existed for some time, the concept
of natural capital has been increasingly promoted within environmental
governance as part of an expanding coalition of the world's most
influential environmental organizations and corporations. In 2006, The
Nature Conser- vancy (TNC) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) partnered with
Stanford University to create the Natural Capital Project (Kareiva et
al. 2011), after which the United Nations Environment Pro- gramme (UNEP)
championed natural capital in its TEEB (The Economics of Ecosystems and
Biodiversity) initiative (TEEB 2010). This inspired the World Bank to
develop its own WAVES (Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem
Services) program (World Bank 2017a) These organizations, along with the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) , World
Business Council for Sustainable Development, and many more, have since
come together in a 'Natural Capital Coalition' (NCC) which recently
released a 'Natural Capital Protocol' intended to 'harmonize existing
best practice and produce a standardized, generally-accepted, global
approach' (Gough 2016, 1). At the 2016 IUCN World Conservation Congress
in Hawaii, NCA was prominent, with a launch celebration of the Natural
Capital Protocol and announcement of an expanded coalition to develop
financial instruments for NCA including new players Credit Suisse and JP
Morgan Chase (IISD 2016).∂ Within this coalition the definition of
natural capital remains ambiguous. In early con- ceptualization by
ecological economists, the concept designated measurement of 'stocks' or
'flows' of natural resources (Daly 2014). Yet within NCA the concept's
meaning has changed significantly to emphasize the monetary value of
natural resources specifically. The Natural Capital Declaration thus
states: 'The term "capital" has been borrowed from the financial sector
to describe the value of the resources and ability of ecosystems to
provide flows of goods and services such as water, medicines and food'
(NCD 2012, 1).∂ [To incorporate natural capital into decision-making
demands appropriate measurement and accounting procedures, since it is
natural resources' ostensible 'economic invisibility' that 'has thus far
been a major cause of their undervaluation, mismanagement and ulti-
mately resulting loss']{.underline} (UNEP 2011, 8). Consequently,
'successful environmental protection needs to be grounded in sound
economics, including explicit recognition, efficient allo- cation, and
fair distribution of the costs and benefits of conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources' (TEEB 2010, 3). The overarching
aim is to incorporate this valuation into benefit--cost analysis, which
'offers a rather convenient way of measuring the overall social values
of alternative policies. Thus it provides a basis for making difficult
policy decisions' (Goulder and Kennedy 2011, 16). Benefit--cost analysis
can then inform compre- hensive accounting procedures assessed at
various scales, from individual firms to particular sectors and beyond,
such that '\[i\]deally, changes in stocks of natural capital would be
eval- uated in monetary terms and incorporated into the national
accounts' (UNEP 2011, 5). Fundamental to NCA is thus the creation of
markets in which natural resources can be bought and sold in ways that
both sustain these and generate financial return to investors; to make
conservation 'not only affordable, but profitable' (Thiam 2016, 3). This
demands '\[t\]ruly sustainable market growth that also delivers
measurable conservation benefits' (Credit Suisse and McKinsey 2016, 7),
commonly termed 'green growth'. NCA thus builds on efforts over the last
few decades to create global markets for trade in ecosystem services. As
UNEP asserts, '\[t\]ried and tested economic mechanisms and markets
exist, which can be replicated and scaled up, including from certified
timber schemes, certifica- tion for rainforest products, payments for
ecosystem services, benefit-sharing schemes and community-based
partnerships' (2011, 9). Similarly, Credit Suisse and McKinsey high-
light 'proven project types and business models', particularly in
'sustainable forestry, sus- tainable agriculture, and ecotourism' (2016,
10).∂ Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is commonly considered the
archetypal natural capital market -- the 'main model' for future
'scaling up' of NCA. PES is also widely seen as the main model for the
global REDD+ (Reduced Emissions through avoided Deforesta- tion and land
Degradation) mechanism, an ambitious effort to link campaigns to halt
deforestation, conserve biodiversity and mitigate climate change.
[Generally conceptual- ized as a quintessential MBI in its aim to
incentivize forest conservation by ascribing mon- etary values to
standing forest that would cover the opportunity costs of alternative
land use and so make conservation more profitable than destruction, over
the last decade REDD+ has been aggressively promoted by conservation
organizations and others who have initiated more than 500 pilot projects
worldwide]{.underline} (Sunderlin et al. 2015). Early World Bank
forecasts anticipated a USD 30 billion global market for REDD+ trade by
2030 (Mollicone et al. 2007).∂ In building on pre-existing mechanisms,
such NCA schemes can be understood as an intensification (Nealon 2008)
rather than a wholesale reinvention of the neoliberalization already
promoted via conservation policy and programing in many locations over
the last several decades. Yet it aims to go far beyond this as well. As
place-based conservation initiatives, [PES and REDD+ are limited in
their capacity to generate significant liquid capital that can be grown
directly through investment in financial markets.]{.underline}
Consequently, the current emphasis in NCA is to move from concrete
markets in goods and services to engagement in global financial markets
-- what Büscher (2013) calls the pursuit of 'liquid nature' (see also
Sullivan 2013). This entails abstracting value from investment in
concrete projects so that it can become fungible and hence convertible
across a greater range of instruments. [The aim is then to combine
different instruments in order to 'bundle a diverse set of cash flows
\... and mold them into a single investment product']{.underline}
(Credit Suisse and McKinsey 2016, 13) [with the ultimate goal of
eventually establishing conservation mechanisms as a new 'asset class'
within conventional finance markets.]{.underline} On the ground, these
diverse sets of cash flows work through conservation mechanisms that
supposedly offer the rural poor 'co-benefits' and 'low-carbon' futures
as they contend with their own political and economic struggles. As we
show, these schemes obviously articulate with local livelihood needs and
concerns, but typically not in ways that match poor rural residents'
hopes and aspirations. Rather than foster agency and empowerment, then,
NCA promotion may also constrain it.∂ Such [promotion is typically
envisioned in neoliberal terms wherein human beings are considered
rational actors functioning as 'entrepreneurs of themselves' who can
therefore be influenced by manipulating costs versus benefits of certain
courses of action]{.underline} (Foucault 2008; Fletcher 2010). This can
clearly be observed within promotion of PES that commonly 'constructs
human behavior as determined by individual, material self-interest'
(McAfee and Shapiro 2010, 595) The World Bank, for instance, states,
'Market-driven PES programs are more likely to be sustainable because
they depend on the self-interest of the affected parties rather than on
taxes, tariffs, philanthropy, or the whims of donors' (McAfee and
Shapiro 2010, 593).∂ The neoliberal biopolitics informing NCA is clearly
apparent in this frame. As NCA becomes a concerted campaign to unite
influential conservation actors and direct conser- vation policy
throughout the world, it urgently demands further scrutiny. Some of this
has already begun with respect to underlying assumptions (see Sullivan
2013, 2017a; Dempsey 2016), but how the NCA vision materializes via
on-the-ground conservation practices -- and how it is perceived and
negotiated by the rural residents it targets -- has yet to be system-
atically investigated. As one of the most prominent new processes
influencing the lives of rural landholders around the globe, critical
analysis of NCA is particularly important for peasant and agrarian
studies. In the following, then, we explore two case studies in rural
southeast Asia where NCA has been explicitly promoted as the rationale
for reno- vated conservation interventions.

#### They're wrong -- attempts to create sustainability are impossible within a capitalist context

A pattern emerges when comparing Palawan and Berau: a [cruel
optimism]{.underline} (Berlant 2010) [offered to local community members
tasked with being the defenders of natural capital while at the same
time being prohibited from practicing livelihoods strategies that they
have engaged in for centuries]{.underline}. But this cruel optimism
extends beyond the villages, and is not merely a case of NGO workers
taking advantage of villagers in order to implement a project with the
veneer of success. Local NGO workers also find themselves caught in the
vise of pragmatism and an economy of expectations (Borup et al. 2006),
hoping for more but accepting less in the interest of making small steps
toward protecting the forest and supporting communities. Local
representatives of BINGOs, meanwhile, find themselves shaped by the
structural constraints of environmental governance in situ just as local
com- munity members do, with both groups giving, receiving and buying
into a range of specu- lative, future-oriented promises that seldom come
to fruition.∂ Interventions in both areas include a PES scheme (a
provincial project in Palawan, a national REDD+ program in East
Kalimantan) established with support from NGOs, the state and bilateral
donors. [What is remarkably consistent across the cases is the speculat-
ive anticipatory 'end objective' that NGOs promote to recruit local
stakeholders]{.underline} (upland farmers in Palawan, district and state
officials in East Kalimantan) [with the seductive promise of
new]{.underline} (financial) [capital derived from the (natural) capital
they supposedly already possess.]{.underline} In order to realize these
benefits, farmers must change their behaviors and attitudes toward
themselves, livelihoods and forest landscapes in ways that, we contend,
exemplify a particularly neoliberal biopolitics promising 'green growth'
as an incentive for this shift. In this way, swidden farmers are turned
into forest stewards, honey hunters become centerfold sustainable
harvesters and, in time, both forest stew- ards and sustainable
harvesters become 'showpieces' for local forest conservation initiat-
ives -- exemplary warriors in defense of natural capital.∂ In contrast
to their common framing by conservationists, however, local people tend
to be more realistic and opportunistic brokers than selfless ecological
stewards. [While they negotiate and enact their role as stewards and
representations of NGO-led programs, they also deftly negotiate the
socio-political networks of extractive capital in search of the most
lucrative prospects.]{.underline} In so doing, they keep opportunities
open for involvement in either endeavor by simply not closing these
off.∂ In some cases, locals will themselves refuse extractive industry
in defense of natural capital -- but usually only insofar as NGOs
continue to invest time, labor, capital and rheto- ric in creating the
anticipatory atmosphere of valuable opportunities to be realized in the
future. [But when these NGOs, along with state agents engaged in
'public--private partner- ships', abandon these ventures, as they often
do, communities may splinter, with some availing themselves of the
opportunities they have kept open for employment in extrac- tive
activities such as oil palm.]{.underline}∂ In other cases, such as
Palawan, community members feel abandoned and desperate with respect to
the intangible aspects of NGO promises and return to what they have
always done: clear old growth forest for productive swidden yields so as
to feed their families. In other instances, they maintain plots and
forest harvests as they shift labor time to work in plantations that
flank the forest uplands. In this way, NGOs often inadver- tently leave
a legacy of frustration alongside the lingering notion of the continued
neces- sity to improve oneself in pursuit of a chimerical development
(Li 2007).∂ Conclusion∂ Our analysis has explored how natural capital
valuation in the interest of biodiversity con- servation has been
promoted in similar ways in two sites in Southeast Asia. A common
pattern emerged in which this promotion is intended to (directly or
indirectly) enroll local resource users as defenders of natural capital
in exchange for the promise of payments to make this defense more
profitable than the extractive opportunities forgone in the process. We
have proposed that [this exhibits a form of neoliberal biopower in terms
of which the imperative to 'make live' is justified by both the role of
biodiversity in sustaining life and the need to incentivize defense of
natural capital through demonstrating the economic potential in
harnessing capitalist markets as the basis of conservation
payments.]{.underline} 'Green growth' becomes the common metaphor for
this logic, shorthand for the particular manner in which life is to be
nurtured within a neoliberal biopolitical perspective. [NCA is thus not
merely a new version of a longstanding ICDP approach; rather, it
espouses a new, overarching set of technologies, conditionalities and
incentive structures hitherto foreign to rural frontier
spaces]{.underline} (Büscher, Dressler, and Fletcher 2014; Turnhout,
Neves, and de Lijster 2014). For this reason it is crucially important
that peasant and agrarian change scholars attend to the implications of
this trend for rural livelihoods.∂ While we our cases demonstrate that
the ideal neoliberal vision informing NCA is rarely if ever wholly
realized in practice, [its biopolitics clearly does circulate
discursively and manifest materially, if only partially, in its
influence on local (self-)perceptions and land use in the short
term.]{.underline} Despite their limited success in improving
conservation outcomes, moreover, NCA initiatives remain lucrative for
some in funding program design and project delivery, infrastructure
development, accounting and monitoring activities and so forth. Yet in
the long term, the common misalignment between NCA interventions and
local needs will likely merely precipitate intensification and
degradation of frontier landscapes. As our cases demonstrate, [most NCA
interventions do not satisfy the benefit--cost 'calculations' of rural
residents as these newer interventions are simply not tangible and
lucrative enough to stop poor farmers, who simply want a better future,
from entering into extractive ventures.]{.underline}∂ While our analysis
includes only two specific cases, anecdotal evidence from other sites
suggests that the common dynamics we have identified are not limited to
these. [These are]{.underline}, we propose, [inherent within NCA, which
embodies an essential tension between the economic valuation it promotes
and its persistent inability to actually generate the financial
resources necessary to direct this valuation toward
conservation.]{.underline} This is, quite simply, because resource
extraction is almost always far more lucrative than conservation, which
results from the fact that this extraction is able to externalize social
and environ- mental costs in order to increase profits (Fletcher et al.
2016). NCA, of course, is intended precisely to encourage the
internalization of such costs in acknowledgment of this dynamic. Yet
[its market-based emphasis means that to do so entails eschewing the
possi- bility of direct regulation in favor of the effort to generate
more revenue from conservation than extraction in order to incentivize
the former.]{.underline} Yet to accomplish this on a substantial scale
is essentially impossible within neoliberal capitalist economies whose
boundaries this strategy takes as given. To generate the profits
necessary for this strategy to work would paradoxically require
externalizing even more social and environmental costs else- where to
generate the revenue needed for conservation offsets (Fletcher et al.
2016).∂ The fact that these daunting issues are rarely addressed in
conservation planning is not necessarily a function of neglect or
miscalculation on the part of planners. Our research demonstrates that
such avoidance seems to stem not from naiveté but more commonly from a
sense of paralysis in the face of overwhelming structural challenges**[.
To really stop extractive expansion would be to call for a fundamental
transformation in how both states and markets operate within a
capitalist political economy predicated on continual expan-
sion]{.underline}**. Efforts to advance a conservation strategy that
acknowledges this reality are under- way (Kothari 2014; Büscher and
Fletcher forthcoming). Short of that, the choice to use NCA initiatives
and focus on local communities in order to try to protect some small
piece of biodiversity is a pragmatic one.∂ NCA for conservation, in sum,
seems plagued by a fundamental contradiction in terms of its overarching
aim to promote cost--benefit analysis in pursuit of conservation. In
practice, as we have shown, rather than producing the promised symbiosis
the former actually tends to undermine the latter, encouraging valuation
based on economic logic yet in failing to provide sufficient revenue
from conserved resources ensures that the cost--benefit equation will be
resolved in favor of the very resource extraction it intends to counter.
In this way, a neoliberal biopolitics is promoted even as it fails to
defend the 'natural capital' it targets.

In this chapter, I will argue that **[hegemonic global capitalism and
American hegemony can easily be seen as the mirrored
reflection]{.underline}** of one other. After all, history demonstrates
that American hegemony came to rest on the geographical spread of
American marketplace society, as manifested in the most recent phase of
capitalism's globalization.1 The nexus between American hegemony and the
hegemony of global capitalism is discovered in the realization that
[they are joint enterprises that can be collapsed together under the
rubric of the term "globalization]{.underline}." As Professor William I.
Robinson argues, this is the result of a historical process wherein
"global capitalism is hegemonic not just because its ideology has become
dominant but also, and perhaps primarily, because it has the ability to
provide material rewards and to impose sanctions."2 Yet, despite the
power of global capitalism, counterhegemonic trends have arisen around
the globe. In fact, "globalization has fueled a rapid process of social
polarization worldwide and a crisis of social reproduction." According
to Robinson, this means that while the number of people who have been
integrated into the global market has increased, "[it is also true that
the **absolute number of destitute and near destitute has been
increasing, and the gap between the rich and the poor in global society
has been widening**]{.underline} since the 1970s."3 Since the early
1970s[, this result can be attributed to the imposition of a neoliberal
economic model that has advanced privatization, the weakening of state,
and deregulation of the economy to such a degree that it has deprived
the public sector of its resources while, at the same time, it has
engaged in transferring those resources into private hands]{.underline}.
While many elites throughout 42 The Future of Global Relations [the
global South]{.underline} recognize these realities and consequences
emanating from following the neoliberal model, they [feel trapped by the
fact that they see no alternative to neoliberalism**. Either one
participates in a neoliberal system**]{.underline} with all of its
attendant problems (including vulnerability to and domination by foreign
elites) **[or one is excluded and marginalized
altogether.]{.underline}** One of the results of this process is the
development of a three-tiered social structure that transcends national
boundaries. According to Robinson, the first tier is made up of about 40
percent of the population "in what traditionally have been core
countries and less in peripheral countries," so that they represent
those who hold "tenured" employment and are able both to maintain and
expand their consumption. The second tier comprises approximately 30
percent of the population in the core countries and around 20 to 30
percent in the periphery. They form a growing army of workers who
experience chronic insecurity about their ability to maintain their
employment, especially since the demise of the welfare state in the
1980s and 1990s. The third tier, "comprising some 30 percent of the
population in the traditional core countries and some 50 percent or more
in the peripheral countries, represents those who have been structurally
excluded" and have now become the "'superfluous' population of global
capitalism."4 Globalization of this type, according to a series of
United Nations Development Reports (UNDP, 1999, 2000) "is a grotesque
and dangerous polarization between the people and countries that have
benefited from the system and those who are mere passive receivers of
its effects."5 [This growing gap between the global rich and the global
poor represents "**the new global apartheid." As a result, the universal
claims of human rights and the employment of human rights standards have
been sacrificed** more slowly in "more developed countries]{.underline}"
(MDCs) [than in "less developed countries]{.underline}" (LDCs), but it
is happening in both First and Third World contexts.6 In previous
publications, I have referred to this phenomenon as "exclusionary
governance." [**Exclusionary governance is both a structural reality and
a political strat**egy.]{.underline} In the case of the United States,
as in the case of nations throughout the [global South, it is a
structural phenomenon to the extent that both the bureaucracy and
rule-making capacity of the state excludes the "lower
classes]{.underline}" and group interests that are incompatible with
hegemonic capitalism and the political ideology of those who have
grabbed the power and institutions of the state. In short[, structural
exclusion effectively and **systematically creates a permanent
underclass of excluded persons that is confined to either poverty, or
jail, or prison**]{.underline} (the U.S. "prison-industrial complex").
The exclusionary state attains its ultimate goal when it is able to
create a society of tremendous inequalities that continue to widen
exponentially over time[. Exclusionary governance is a political
strategy to the extent that **it denies giving voice to the concerns of
the majority of people in a nation** and further separates large social
groups from access to the processes of national decision
making]{.underline}. Strategically, the articulation of the national
interest falls to elite groups who will determine, among themselves, how
wealth will be distributed within the nation.7 43 In the context of the
global South, we find that the trends associated with these
manifestations [of exclusionary governance have resulted in a crisis of
legitimacy for the state]{.underline}---especially in those
nation-states that have willingly privatized government services and
sold them to the highest corporate bidder. Yet, the resulting
socioeconomic and sociopolitical exclusion of privatization and [market
fundamentalism has led to higher levels of social conflict]{.underline}
("sociopolitical instability," or SPI). Given this trend, Robinson
writes, "Privatization results in a pure market-determined distribution.
Given the highly skewed structure of income distribution, the process
tends to aggravate inequalities and social polarization. It has
predictably sparked sharp conflicts."8 This is where the significance of
my definition of the Exclusionary State comes in. To begin with, the ES
is not limited to authoritarian or dictatorial regimes but can also be
applied to the so-called democracies. The criterion that matters most
for making a determination of whether or not a country is truly
democratic is a criterion that evaluates how, and to what degree, that
state allows for the participation of the majority of its social
classes, groups, and interests in both its deliberations and its
distributional decisions. [The greater the degree of
inclusiveness]{.underline}, I have found that [there is a greater
likelihood of]{.underline} higher degrees of stability and legitimacy as
well as [a strong adherence to the protection of human rights, civil
liberties, and an expanding human rights culture.9]{.underline} In the
alternative, the greater the degree of political and economic exclusion,
I have found that there is a trend toward sociopolitical instability and
a strong bias against democracy as a mechanism for political
participation and the protection of civil rights and civil liberties.10
From this analysis, it can be argued that [hegemonic global capitalism
is a force that]{.underline} in addition to producing tremendous profits
for elite social classes, it simultaneously **[produces instability,
inequalities, and social conflict]{.underline}** for the majority of
social classes, groups, and interests that exist outside of a culture of
"crony capitalism." Among the many examples to choose from is the 1994
\$50 billion economic bailout of Mexico by U.S. taxpayers. It was sold
as a "neighborly act" that was designed to help the people of Mexico. In
fact, it only bailed out the Wall Street speculators and the World Bank
theorists who had imposed devastating economic "adjustments" on Mexico
that failed to deliver their promised benefit and instead led to the
infamous peso crisis.11 This event is representative of a consistent
pattern of governance created by U.S. hegemony throughout the Third
World for decades.12 [Under the auspices of both U.S. hegemony and
hegemonic global capitalism, **most Third World leaders pursued
self-serving policies and accepted inducements from the United
States,**]{.underline} as well as other industrial nations, that have
effectively eroded any hope for balanced development and stability.
Under the Bush-II administration, "crony capitalism" has now made its
most glaring appearance in the First World as well. This is not to say
that it was not introduced before 2001. In the late 1980s, the United
States, under the first President Bush, failed to effectively deal with
the savings and loan crisis. Speculation and bad investments by bankers
resulted in massive defaults by banks to their customers. Only the
Federal Deposit Insurance Global Capitalism vs. Universal Human Rights
Law 44 The Future of Global Relations Corporation (FDIC) could even
begin to bail out the victims of the fraud--- and then only up to
\$100,000 of their deposits. It was a financial crisis that resulted in
about 1,169 savings and loan institutions collapsing and having to be
bailed out at a cost of over \$500 billion through both the FDIC and
heavy borrowing from the accounts in social security. As the so-called
post--cold war "peace dividend" evaporated in scandal and "crony
capitalism," it would be nothing compared to the 2001 through 2008
period under the second President Bush as Halliburton became the
recipient of no-bid contracts from the Pentagon and as corporations like
ENRON stole the pension funds of its employees with virtual impunity
and, in September 2008, Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson would
come to Congress begging for an almost \$1 trillion bailout package for
Wall Street in order to deal with the ripple effects of the real estate
meltdown. Not to be outdone in the arena of market manipulation and war
profiteering, the major U.S. oil companies---from Exxon/Mobil, Shell,
and Conoco Philips to Chevron/Texaco, Petrobras, and Royal
Dutch/Shell---derived their greatest tax-free profits in history from
the Bush-II administration as it made its journey through Iraq.13 In
light of this history, we may conclude that U.S. Global Hegemony--- when
intertwined with hegemonic global capitalism---has been an enterprise
that has contributed to higher levels of socioeconomic instability in
both First and Third World settings. The practice of this brand of
capitalism may easily be referred to as monopolistic and antithetical to
the ideal of the free market. At the very least, Wall Street enjoyed
unregulated "free market" profiteering on the way up and then sought to
enjoy socializing the cost of its financial recklessness on the way down
as it sought to be rescued by a huge U.S. government bailout. [When
practiced throughout the Third World**, hegemonic global capitalism
embodies all of the major characteristics of exclusionary
governanc**e]{.underline} by promoting and protecting "exclusionary
states" and exclusionary practices that have not only disregarded human
rights but violated basic human rights standards, protections, and
concepts. Given the nature of this history, [we can at least dispense
with the illusion that the American Hegemon is benign or that the
regimes it creates abroad are benign]{.underline}. In this regard, one
of the most fundamental and enduring conflicts in the U.S. foreign
policy establishment is the one between internationalists and
nationalists. Internationalists, which include business and political
elites driven by ideology and economic interests, have supported global
institutions committed to lowering trade barriers and working to
facilitate the progress of international trade and investment through
multilateral lending arrangements. Nationalists, who have been coequally
driven by ideology and economic interests, have supported high tariff
barriers and opposed U.S. involvement in global institutions. In large
measure, the internationalists have included business firms with
extensive ties to foreign markets through both exports and foreign
direct investments. In contrast, nationalist business interests have
been largely tied to the U.S. domestic market and dependent on tariffs
or other forms of trade protection to secure a profitable place in the
U.S. market. Global Capitalism vs. Universal Human Rights Law 45 The
U.S. corporate and political elites built their version of the post-1945
world within the framework of a Bretton Woods system that would help
make the transition from British global hegemony to U.S. global hegemony
a reality. As a hegemonic power, the United States would be forced to
respond strategically, not only for the sake of maximizing the power of
U.S. economic interests, but also for the opportunity to direct the
establishment of multilateral global institutions such as the IMF and
World Bank. In other words, the post-1945 international [regime of
finance and investment would be built in correspondence with the goals
and policies of America's political and economic elites]{.underline} who
not only made U.S. foreign policy but also directed the progress,
priorities, and goals of the American Hegemon. It is a point underscored
by Stephen Toope, who notes, "Whether one holds on to the hegemonic
explanation of regime creation (perhaps incorporating non-material
factors), or adopts a more complex view linking material and
non-material factors in an interactive process of normative evolution,
it is important to remember that neither hegemons nor regimes are
inevitably benign."14 Toope's critique is especially insightful for
analyzing the claim that the United States can create democratic regimes
throughout the Third World without the use of military force and simply
by the force of American ideals. The nature of the American occupation
of Iraq from 2003 through 2008--- and beyond---points to the inherent
instability of a neoliberal economic model built on the foundations of
privatization as well as the inherent inability of an American Hegemon
to impose transplanted democratic ideals on an ethnically divided
society that has few historical roots within a democratic tradition.
Rather, the interactive process of normative evolution in Iraq (in the
twenty-first century) has exposed the weakness of a hegemonic enterprise
that was supposed to bring stability not only to Iraq but also to the
entire region of the Middle East. According to realist theory,
instability is antithetical to what hegemony is designed to produce. So,
if hegemony is supposed to produce international stability and fails to
do so, then we may conclude that it is either ineffective as a
stabilizing force in world affairs or, in the alternative, can only
produce and reproduce hegemony through force and the exercise of raw
power. It then follows that both global capitalism and the U.S.
hegemonic enterprise work in combination to reproduce economic and
political structures that are exclusionary in theory, practice, and
outcome. It also follows that the capitalist structure is itself so
inherently unstable that it requires U.S. military force to back it up
and sustain it over the long term. Hence, the resulting combination of
sociopolitical and socioeconomic instability, in combination with the
suppression of excluded social forces (including ethnic minorities),
reveals [the continued existence of an international socioeconomic and
sociopolitical order that is **antithetical to the recognition,
enforcement, and practice of human rights.**]{.underline}

Thought, 8:3, 396-409, DOI: 10.1080/21598282.2018.1506261 Historically,
[the standard interpretation of human rights is continuous with the
history of liberal citizenship rights]{.underline}. Even though the
Soviet Union was involved in the negotiations that created the UD, their
participation did not affect the legal form the declaration took. [The
negotiations that led to the promulgation of the UD stretched from
January 1947 until December 1948]{.underline}. They were overseen by
Eleanor Roosevelt and the various arguments synthesized into draft form
by Canadian lawyer John Humpheries, both of whom clearly had the model
of liberal-democratic constitutions in mind as their guiding idea
(Morsink 1999, 4--13). [They freed that idea of liberal rights as
actionable claims held by individuals from the bounds of nationality so
that they could be asserted by individuals against any state
whatsoever]{.underline}. Hence, they completed the process of
abstraction, traced by Marx in "On the Jewish Question," of rights from
the concrete social situation of human beings (Marx 1975, 166--167).
[Whereas liberal rights extended citizenship to]{.underline} (at the
time) [all white males]{.underline}, independently of factors such as
class, **[so too human rights extended analogous legal entitlements to
all people, regardless of citizenship]{.underline}**. As Louis Henkin
argues, the "national rights theories or systems, harkening back through
English, American, and French constitutionalism to John Locke et. al."
are the historical basis of human rights (Henkin 1981, 263). [The aim
was to provide similar protections to the security of individual persons
and their interests that liberal citizenships rights did, but, since
human rights are not dependent upon citizenship, they could be used by
citizens of totalitarian societies to undermine the oppressive political
structures under which they lived. **Considered philosophically, the
standard interpretation of human rights is rooted in the classical
liberal understanding of the moral equality of persons**]{.underline}.
They assume, as Noberto Bobbio puts it, that "the individual has
intrinsic value. The value of the state is instrumental, the value of
the human beings it is supposed to protect is intrinsic" (Bobbio 1996,
43). [The proper purpose of the state, therefore, "is the growth of the
individual, free as far as is possible from external
conditioning"]{.underline} (Bobbio 1996, 43). Human rights sought an
international consensus around this value such that, over time, all
states would secure, as a minimum necessary for state legitimacy, the
rights asserted in the UD**[. If we thus put the historical and the
political together, we get a political project in which the basic
institutions of liberal-capitalist society, private property, regulated
markets, representative political institutions are posited as norms for
all societies to seek to realize.]{.underline}** Positive or social
rights can form part of the package but these are interpreted in a way
that limits their transformative power. That is, [they are interpreted
in such a way as to ensure that they do not undermine capitalist
property relations but rather secure them]{.underline}. Henkin thus
reassures classical liberals fearful of the re-distributive potential of
positive rights that they have nothing to fear: [it was not Marx, it was
Bismarck, the conservative Iron Chancellor of Germany who introduced the
welfare state into Europe]{.underline}. Following him, the French and
English introduced their own versions. But this essential contribution
by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had its more recent
antecedents in Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He spoke of freedoms, not
rights, but his freedoms included "freedom from want." (Henkin 1999, 20)
[The positive social rights listed in the UD include "the right to
social security" and all other economic, social, and cultural rights
"indispensable for . . . dignity]{.underline}" (UN 1948, "Universal
Declaration of Human Rights," Article 22). [As with classical
liberalism, the UD is silent on how this goal is to be achieved, and the
liberal leading lights who drafted it worried more about the problem of
oppressive exercise of state power than the oppressive power that
reified market forces exercise over people's lives and
life-horizons.]{.underline} While they do not recognize or correct for
the reified power of market forces, **[human rights in the standard
interpretation do provide a basis for a critique of existing patterns of
wealth distribution.]{.underline}** The critique of wealth distribution
derives from the observable fact that, as Thomas Pogge notes, the global
economy fails to enable people to meet "their basic needs" (Pogge 2010,
29). **[Hence human rights provide "the philosophical underpinning for
an account of core human entitlements that should be respected and
implemented by the governments of all nations, as a bare minimum of what
respect for human dignity requires]{.underline}**" (Nussbaum 2006, 70).
**[Poverty is thus understood as primarily an economic-moral problem of
wealth distribution, not a structural economic-moral problem of class
structure and wealth production through the exploitation of
labour]{.underline}**. **[Standard interpretation policy thus demands
"the redistribution of wealth throughout the globe]{.underline}**"
(Caney 2010, 136) **[but not the overthrow of class
power]{.underline}**. The whole structural issue of alienation and
exploitation of labour (including the reproductive labour of women)
disappears. **[The social causes of poverty disappear behind
distribution as mere appearance]{.underline}**. For the standard
interpretation, legal recognition of moral equality entails policies
that re-distribute some wealth from the ruling to the working class,
nationally and globally, **[but not changes in class structure that
would weaken or undermine the ruling class' control over universally
needed productive resources---the material basis of the social processes
through which they extract and appropriate wealth from
workers]{.underline}**. The standard interpretation becomes radically
transformative only with regard to certain cultural practices. Rituals
and social structures that are rooted in organicist principles of social
organization which determine individual identity by their place in the
social whole and which see the good life as fulfilling the assigned
duties of one's station seem, to proponents of the standard
interpretation, to violate the dignity of individuals understood as
atomic centres of interest and desire. Defenders of the standard
interpretation are not absolutely wrong in their arguments on this
front. [Defences of non-liberal value systems in the Global South can be
cynical ruses employed by ruling groups to avoid critique by invoking
cultural values which have little to do with their own contemporary
social and political reality.]{.underline} As Rhoda Howard argues,
defenders of "cultural difference" in the Global North often "confuse
Asian, African, and Central and South American states with \[no longer
extant\] indigenous societies, excusing thereby uses of power against
individuals that they would never accept as legitimate if practiced
against themselves" (Howard 1995, 61; see also Burke 2010, 35). The
problem of ideological invocation of "traditional values" by cynical
elites is a real problem. [The extent to which defenders of the standard
interpretation countenance direct (armed) intervention in order to
uphold human rights is a matter of dispute, but all defenders of the
standard interpretation presuppose the moral superiority of human rights
principles over cultural integrity and national sovereignty]{.underline}
(Kaldor 2010, 341). However, as Amartya Sen notes, rarely are indigenous
cultures without internal resources of critique and transformation, and
standard interpretation critics of "cultural difference" are not
sufficiently attentive to these internal resources for change, or the
agency of oppressed people in the Global South. **[The very indigenous
cultures often attacked for human rights violations by defenders of
human rights from the Global North typically contain
principles,]{.underline}** Sen argues, **[that assert constraints on the
legitimate exercise of power and protect core interests of individuals,
even in organicist models of social organization]{.underline}** (Sen
2009, 37, 330). Since the standard interpretation equates violations of
human dignity with the transgression of liberal norms of atomic
individuality, it is incapable of seeing the value for individuals of
organic cultural forms that generate meaning and ensure material
security or the power of the members of these cultures to change those
aspects of their culture which are actually oppressive. In sum, **[the
standard interpretation sees human rights as universalized expressions
of the core moral value defended by the rights of classical liberalism:
the supreme value of the dignity of the human individual.]{.underline}**
Although the standard interpretation acknowledges classical liberal
rights as the historical source of human rights, it is not beholden to
the dichotomies of classical liberal political theory (negative versus
positive liberty, negative versus positive rights, formal freedoms
versus substantive freedom, etc.). At the same time, [the standard
interpretation does not argue that the comprehensive and universal
realization of human rights requires the fundamental transformation of
capitalist society]{.underline}. That is the primary reason why radical
critics of the capitalist world have been dismissive of the political
and economic value of human rights to struggles against inequality,
oppression, domination, and imperialist violence.

#### The 1AC's narrative of human rights and a humanitarian motivation for the plan is a guise to boost the political economy of neoliberalism and justifies a modern form of neointerventionsim that manifests into invasions of other countries and colonial slaughter of the global south

Accordingly, intra-state conflicts in Central America, Africa, and, as
classified by the U.S. National Security Decision Directives in 1987,
other conflicts "often localized, generally in the [Third
World]{.underline}" prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall were generally
interpreted as distinct from "conventional warfare." Dexter writes:
"rather than studying war per se, analysts \[during this period\] chose
to study the type of war that was most important to them, that of
conflict between great powers" (2007, 1060). Thus, during the Cold War,
conflict between "the [un-great powers" were "lumped together" and
"deintellectualized]{.underline}" (Smith 2003, 33). Accordingly, [during
the post-Cold War period, strategic military studies of the Global North
shifts to interpret contemporary conflict as "new" and as outstripping
the old paradigms of warfare]{.underline}. As Dexter states, the
violence in [Rwanda, Bosnia, or the "new terrorism" of the Islamic
State]{.underline} and of narcotraffickers [gets described as novel and
unprecedented]{.underline}. In this sense, the [measures used by Western
allied nation-states]{.underline} to respond to such violence also take
on "[new" dimensions and forms of justification]{.underline}. For
example, the framing of the post-Cold War era as giving rise to novel
forms of warfare that lack political or systematic demands relies on
conceptions of criminality, individual gain, and [conceptions of
lawlessness and criminality]{.underline}. Such conceptions of warfare
thereby [resituate Western allied nation-states as the defenders of
values that preserve human rights]{.underline}, cosmopolitanism, and
democratic participation. Within these terms, the lan[guage of
"civilians" also becomes an important moral category, whereby
"combatant" or "rebel" groups manipulate and victimize
civilians]{.underline} for their own ends. Dexter notes: Like the
[moralizing language of the Bush administration]{.underline} in the U.S.
and Tony Blair in the UK, new [war becomes a battle between good and
bad, the good being those have responded positively to globalization and
the bad those who have not]{.underline}. . . . Civilians are \[conceived
as\] not only amenable to politicization: they \[are also assumed\] to
favor a politics of inclusion, tolerance, and mutual respect. (2007,
1063) As such, "[new war" views legitimize Western intervention by
framing the motivations for violence and conflict as rooted in criminal
intent and personal gain. Narratives of rebel groups, insurgents,
terrorists, and so on as criminals effectively depoliticized the motives
of those engaged in conflict by abstracting actors from the historical
and political conditions that lead to conflict]{.underline} (1068).
David Chandler, a theorist of governance studies, makes the argument
that this depoliticization and the attribution of criminality
reclassifies intra-state warfare as conflict that is in need of
international policing and moral mediation through interventionist
efforts (Dexter 2007, 1068, quoting Chandler 2006). According to
Chandler, these interventionist efforts bring us to a tripartite
distinction made by Donald Rumsfeld, the U.S. Secretary of Defense from
2001 to 2006, that provide a somewhat con[cise framing of the shifts
within interventionist reasoning that track the language and ontology of
conceptions of neointerventionism]{.underline}. Namely, Rumsfeld's
statement in a news briefing in 2002, when asked about the relationship
between the government of Iraq and supply chains of weapons of mass
destruction to "extremist" groups, includes the following: "there are
known knows; there are things we know that we know. There are known
unknowns; that is to say, there are things that we now know we don't
know. But there are also unknown unknowns---there are things we do not
know we don't know" (Chandler 2014, 50). According to Chandler, the
"known knowns" in this statement suggest a modernist or li[beral
conception of interventionist strategizing wherein "linear and universal
assumptions of the progressive accumulation of knowledge of laws and
regularities of human affairs" structures decision making in
governance]{.underline} (50). In [political economy, he tracks this
conception of "top down" interventionism through Franklin Roosevelt's
New Deal policies in the U.S.]{.underline}, Keynesianism in the UK, and
Stalinism and Nazism in Russia and Germany. [Neoliberalism then emerges
post-WWII as a response to the extensions of the state during these
prior periods]{.underline}. He argues that "in the postwar period . . .
top-down interference could only lead to the erosion of liberal freedoms
and that active governance interventions necessarily had to work on the
basis of bottom-up understandings that worked on the pre-conditions
necessary for effective market and democratic systems" (52).1
[Neoliberalism then can be understood as the presumption of "known
unknowns," wherein political economists and intervening actors assume
complex conceptions of human life and decision making that resist direct
analysis and predictability]{.underline}. Accordingly, working from a
neoliberal model, the [stability or instability of markets become the
means to indirectly monitor the complex networks of motivations and
behaviors of the individuals within nation-states.]{.underline} This
[form of indirect governance]{.underline} also tracks the Cold War-era
conception of warfare described by Dexter. Namely, the managerial stance
of strategic studies during the Cold War period casts complexity and
political interest on the outcomes of market fluctuations and trade.
[After the fall of the Soviet Union]{.underline}, then, [interventionism
studies needed to be reframed]{.underline} around the problem of policy
interventions despite retaining "known unknowns." Such [epistemic gaps
could no longer be framed through proxy-wars]{.underline} or battles
between communism and capitalism. Chandler highlights World Bank policy
advisor Douglass North as one such strategist who considered further
operations at the level of human "consciousness" and "intentionality" a
necessity despite the apparent complexity of social interaction and
decision-making. Chandler writes: For Hayek \[an archetypical neoliberal
political economist, the problem of complex life and its governance\]
was never a problem as complex life was constituted as a hidden process
and as a boundary limit to governmental knowledge. [For neoliberalism as
a governing rationality, the contradictions gradually became clearer as
policy-makers claimed to be able to intervene in the sphere of the
'known unknowns' on the basis of 'correcting' processes of social
interaction, understood as systematic path-dependencies or endogenous
social, cultural and ideational constructions]{.underline}. (55)
Governance then, on this model, requires gathering information and
knowledge of the "known unknowns" to have a significant impact on the
outcomes that emerge through market regulations. Following this problem
within governance and interventionist strategizing, Chandler points to
the development of complexity theory and the language of "resilience."
He highlights, for instance, that the emergence of discourses about
"complexity"---both within quantum mechanics and the social
sciences---following World War I, Heisenberg's "uncertainty principle,"
JeanFrançoise Lyotard's critique of classical determinism in the 1970s,
and the development of "chaos theory" in the late 1980s were all
precursors to the governmental justifications for interventionist
efforts that arose in the early 2000s (48--50). Chandler argues that
this growing prominence of theories of complexity and emergent systems
eventually made their impact on military strategy and foreign relations
and arose as a reply to the shortcomings of neoliberal governance
models. [Resilience models, like neoliberalism, rely on views about the
complexity of human interactions and the "hidden processes" that give
rise to specific outcomes.]{.underline} However, unlike neoliberalism,
policy failures are, as the UK's 2013 National Adaptation Programme on
climate change suggests are not failures, but "a learning opportunity
with regard to the systemic process of unintended consequences and
side-effects in a complex world" (57). The only failures possible on the
resilience model are when policy makers and strategists do not "learn"
or adapt from the outcomes of a particular policy or interventionist
effort. To clarify this point, in a recent interview, political
philosopher, [Robin James described resilience thinking as a three-step
process: "Resilience is a specific type of therapeutic overcoming. It
has three steps: (1) perform damage so that others can see, feel, and
understand it; (2) recycle or overcome that damage, so that you come out
ahead of where you were even before the damage hit; (3) pay that surplus
value---that value added by recycling---to some hegemonic institution,
like white supremacist patriarchy, or capital, or the
State]{.underline}, something like that. This isn't just coping---it's a
very, very specific form of coping designed to get individuals to
perform the superficial trappings of recovery from deep, systemic
issues, all the while [reinforcing and intensifying the very systemic
issues it claims to solve]{.underline}." (James 2016)2 As such, ["good"
governance builds on the reflexive adaptation of human beings to
specific forms of trauma, such as physical, mental, and economic
violence, but appeals to the endurance of people and
institutions]{.underline} without "goal-based instrumental
policy-making" (Chandler 2014, 58). As such, for example,
[interventionist efforts to impact the "War on Drugs" in Latin America
have been reframed through resilience models that view the organization
of the transnational drug trade as ever-capable of adapting to market
and military strategies]{.underline} (Finkenbusch 2017, 66). [The
response, then, is to see how drug cartels and the communities impacted
by drug trafficking are "resilient," that is, as either upholding
civilian cosmopolitan and multicultural values, or in terms of the
resilience of criminality, deviance, and lawlessness, which thereby
justifies further intervening efforts]{.underline}. Peter Finkenbusch
argues, regarding the 2007 U.S.-Mexican security agreement called the
Mérida Initiative, that this U.S. interventionist effort tracks the
shifts between neoliberal interventionist models and resilience models.
Namely, this security agreement, he writes, "went within just a few
years from a rather straightforward, Cold War-type of arms deal
centering on law enforcement training and military equipment deliveries
to a comprehensive policy endeavor aimed at the promotion of good
governance, the protection of human rights and the inclusion of civil
society" (2017, 3). This shift to [viewing Mexican society and Mexican
institutions as "weak" or in need of further "support" in order to be
resilient to the ongoing patterns of drug-related crime thereby serves
to motivate neointerventionism]{.underline}. This form of
interventionism expands the scope of state-sponsored efforts from
"formal state institutions to informal social milieu and from technical
assistance and material resource transfers to capacity-building and
empowerment" (4). As Dexter argues, this shift thereby depoliticizes the
interventionist efforts that seek to reshape and control educational,
legal, economic, and cultural institutions of the Global South under the
auspices of strengthening the "social fabric" of "weak states." For
example, among the "Four Pillars" of the Mérida Initiative are efforts
aimed at "Institutionalizing Reforms to Sustain the Rule of Law and
Respect for Human Rights in Mexico" and "Building Strong and Resilient
Communities" (Seelke and Finklea 2017).

[Classic definitions]{.underline} of capitalism [stress]{.underline}

### Explains/RC Ukraine/Russia

#### Tensions in Ukraine exist because of EU and Russian capital competition -- both seek to expand their sphere of influence. This means conflict is inevitable without a reexamination of capitalistic motives.

**Ferguson 14** Rob Ferguson, "Ukraine: imperialism, war and the left",
in *International Socialism: Issue 144*, 10/10/14,
http://isj.org.uk/ukraine-imperialism-war-and-the-left/

Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, [the EU and NATO have sought to
expand their sphere of influence into the former Soviet bloc, while
Russia has sought to retain influence]{.underline} and, where possible,
restore its own dominance over its "near abroad"-the former republics of
the Soviet Union that won independence after 1991.27

[The balance has long been in the West's favour]{.underline} and Russia
could do little or nothing as one by one Eastern European countries,
including the Baltic states, signed up to the EU and NATO. [By 2009, 12
former Communist states had joined NATO, 11 of them joining the
EU.]{.underline} [In 2014]{.underline} Georgia, Moldova and
[Ukraine]{.underline} all [signed an EU "Deep and Comprehensive Free
Trade Agreement".]{.underline}

It is important to grasp that [the **gathering tensions**]{.underline}
over the membership of rival trade blocs in Eastern Europe and the
Russian periphery **[are not incidental, nor simply a matter of an
aggressive foreign policy]{.underline}** on the part of the EU; neither
are they simply a sentimental attachment to former empire or just fear
of encirclement on the part of Russia. This is not a matter of joining a
"club" in order just to get some attractive offers or deals[. **The
rivalry** over these regional economic blocs **is an expression of the
economic competition between capitals on a world scale.**]{.underline}

At stake are vast resources and markets. **[Each bloc is compelled to
seek maximum competitive advantage against its rivals and to strengthen
its competitive position in the world market]{.underline}**. The
European Union was formed precisely so that its member states could
compete against other major economies such as the US, Japan, the
south-east Asian states and now China. [With the end of the Cold War, it
was inevitable the EU would turn eastwards.]{.underline}

David Cadier, albeit in the language of an academic economist, has quite
astutely traced the dynamic of competition between the EU and the
Russian sponsored Eurasian Customs Union (ECU) and the contradictory
pressures this competition exerts on the states they wish to
"integrate". As [in the case of Ukraine, none of these states fall
neatly into one economic sphere of influence or the other.
They]{.underline} all [have conflicting interests in both Russia and its
ECU partners and in EU markets]{.underline}28 most are also heavily
dependent on Russian gas and energy supplies. [The principal rivals
themselves are also highly interdependent on one another.]{.underline}

[Despite this, both **"partnerships" are mutually
exclusive**]{.underline}; their rules preclude membership of both
regional blocs. As Lenin and Bukharin observed a century ago in arguing
against Karl Kautsky[, **increasing economic integration on a world
scale does not reduce competition**.]{.underline} On the contrary,
[**the pressure to seek advantage at the expense of a rival capital**,
or seize the resources and markets it controls, **means that competition
will always reassert itsel**f]{.underline}, however "illogical" this may
appear.

Cadier argues that [these economic "partnerships" are "two competing
region-building endeavours" aimed at the same group of
countries]{.underline} in Russia's "near abroad"; [both **Russia and the
EU therefore attempt to shape the economic**]{.underline},
administrative and, to some extent, political **[structures of the
states of their common neighbourhood]{.underline}**, albeit by different
means and with differing records of success".29 In Marxist terms, [**we
are back to the classic analysis of imperialism-the development of
economic competition between blocs of capita**l-and military **rivalry
between states.**]{.underline}

It is no accident that competition between the EU and Russia came to a
head over Ukraine, even though neither side anticipated the outcome and
both miscalculated badly. [**The world economic crisis of 2008-9 has led
to greater pressur**e on the ruling classes of nation states outside the
major regional trade blocs to seek "partnership" deals]{.underline} or
membership status, whatever the costs[**. The impact** of the crisis
**on trade and rising deficits increases the need to reduce tariffs**
(itself a tool of capitalist competition)]{.underline}. [This combined
with rapidly depleting reserves **puts immense pressure on these states
to sign up to these "partnerships",**]{.underline} whatever the terms.
The terms, of course, come at a price for the workers of these states
themselves.

[Ukraine is a classic example]{.underline}. President Yanukovych
attempted to balance between the ECU and the EU and keep a foot in both.
He sought observer status in the ECU while at the same time negotiating
the Association Agreement with the EU. However, [Ukraine's looming
economic crisis and the "take it or leave it" terms presented by both
Russia and the EU would not permit this balancing act to
continue.]{.underline} The EU overplayed its hand, and Yanukovych turned
to Russia. The balancing act was over and Ukraine toppled.

[Russia has always drawn red lines round the bordering
states]{.underline} of Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. However, some of these states significantly
outweigh others in importance. [Ukraine was the jewel in the
crown]{.underline}. [Ukraine joining the ECU was essential to Putin's
regional economic project]{.underline}. Without Ukraine the ECU just
leaves Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, an altogether reduced project
entirely, and one that other states have less incentive to join.

[The economic expansion of the EU also carries with it the threat of
ever greater military encroachment by NATO. If Ukraine were to slip out
of Russia's orbit]{.underline} altogether, Russia's [regional and global
position would be immeasurably weakened]{.underline}. Putin was never
going to let that happen. While he had never calculated on the fall of
Yanukovych and his replacement by a pro-Western regime in Kiev, the West
for its part grossly underestimated Russia's determination.
[When]{.underline} Yanukovych fell and [Ukraine turned west, **Russia's
economic levers were no longer sufficient and Putin deployed Russia's
geopolitical advantage and military resources to de-stabilise
Ukrain**e]{.underline} and at the very least, prevent it from
integrating fully into a Western economic and military alliance.

Russia's strategy over Ukraine followed a pattern of intervention it has
adopted since the 1990s. [Russia has avoided becoming militarily
involved in neighbouring states, with the notable exception of
Chechny]{.underline}a, which it invaded after the republic declared
independence. The war in Afghanistan and the first war in Chechnya
aroused massive opposition in Russia and the legacy continues to hang
over Russian foreign policy.30 Instead [**Russia** fostered national and
ethnic **conflicts that destabilised neighbouring states and made them
dependent on Russian goodwill.**]{.underline}

The Maidan arose in 2013, as it did in 2004, because the new Ukrainian
ruling class failed to share state power democratically or to invest in
the development of its own society. Lacking democratic legitimacy or an
adequate social consensus made the state weak and less capable of
dealing with the challenges and opportunities it faced from neighbouring
powers. This past quarter century [we have seen the simultaneous
construction of a new nation state and its still incomplete transition
to a capitalist economy]{.underline}. State building and the
privatisation of the nationalised assets have been not only
simultaneous, but also symbiotic processes. [The state was built as the
instrument for the wholesale transfer of these assets into the hands of
a very narrow class]{.underline} that we call the oligarchs. The social
class then turned the state to enabling new rounds of wealth
accumulation from the living labour deployed in the growing private
sector. The old Stalinist bureaucracy was not driven out of the
collapsing nationalised economy. Rather, it made its own way to the
individual and corporate ownership of the economy's "commanding
heights". So too did it ensure its own resurrection in the political
sphere where it became the absolutely dominant subject of the
multi-party system. The state rested on a fragile social consensus of a
population holding onto an ever fading promise that prosperity would
come from leaving the Soviet Union and joining the West. The Ukrainian
masses rose up in frustration and anger over this broken promise in
1994, 2001 and 2004 1, but their increasingly massive protests failed
each time to fundamentally change things. On the contrary, the Ukrainian
people are poorer today as they were in the last year of the USSR, and
they are riven by far more inequalities than they were then. Their
influence over public policy and public institutions remains weak, even
if they have managed repeatedly to recover their basic rights to free
expression, assembly and self organisation. Thus the present crisis is
in the first instance attributable to the failure of a newly independent
state to meet the mass expectations on which it was founded in 1991 The
Maidan in the winter of 2013-14 was the latest revolt against this
manifest failure, a mass movement that briefly undermined the new ruling
class, drove its most powerful faction out of the country, but
ultimately failed to dislodge it from the political and economic
institutions. However, the Maidan was sufficiently threatening to compel
the Russian state -- gendarme of the transnational ruling class in its
region -- to intervene and seize Crimea, to arm a revanchist insurgency
in the Donbas, and so to prevent the revolutionary process from
spreading into the east and south. The international isolation of the
Ukrainian state The second historical development that contributed to
the outbreak of the current crisis was the failure of the Ukrainian
state -- for reasons not of its own making alone -- to integrate
successfully into either the Euro-Atlantic alliance or the Russia-led
alliance. Its resulting isolation from the integration projects on
either side made Ukraine particularly vulnerable to shifts in the
relations between the big powers in the region. After succeeding Leonid
Kravchuk as president in 1994, Leonid Kuchma pursued a strategy to build
a national ruling class that could hold its own place in the
international political economy. His strategy required keeping Western
and Russian capital out of the first big privatisations of nationalised
property, accumulating wealth at home and upgrading technologically so
as to prepare the country for membership in the EU and its single
market. Kuchma's strategy failed because the state leadership could not
compel its own capitalists to keep their wealth in the country to
upgrade and diversify the domestic economy. Rather, Ukraine became a low
wage, energy and materials intensive exporter of primary goods and semi
finished products in agriculture, energy, chemicals and minerals, the
profits from which the oligarchs sent abroad. 2 There was a rapid rate
of economic recovery on the back of growing exports. However, the
concomitant recovery in wages and services was strikingly uneven across
the regions, with average wages in the east rising to 700 hryvnia by mid
2004, against 500 in the west of the country. The mounting social and
regional economic inequalities and an increasingly repressive regime
were the triggers for the 2004 Orange Revolution. From Kuchma's second
term in office and Putin's first in Russia, Russian capitalists
succeeded in placing substantial investments in the Ukrainian economy.
Kuchma's successor in 2004, Viktor Yushchenko, tried to offset the
Russian advance by inviting in European investment capital. By 2008
[**the Ukrainian economy was well penetrated by both Western and Russian
investors,** neither]{.underline} of whom [contributed much to
diversifying or upgrading it. Rather, **each side was trying to
incorporate Ukraine's natural resources, cheap labour and its markets
onto a low technological echelon** of its own regional chains of
production and consumption.]{.underline} Yet the 2008 financial crisis
prevented either side from making a bid for a dominant position. [The
Ukrainian oligarchs still held onto their hope of remaining an
**independent capitalist class in the global political
economy**]{.underline}. They resisted incorporation into the succession
of Russia-led integration projects: the Commonwealth of Independent
States and the Customs Union. The European Union, on the other hand, did
not want them in as members -- and made that abundantly clear in 2005-7
by rejecting the requests for a membership path from Yushchenko, the
most pro-Western of all Ukraine's leaders. Moreover, the EU's biggest
states -- Germany, France and Italy -- remained steadfastly opposed to
offering Ukraine membership in NATO. So Ukraine ended up in the grey
zone between US-led Europe and Russia, and the likely recipient of
friction between them that grew as Russia revived and US influence in
Europe waned. The revival of Russian imperialism The third historical
development contributing to the current crisis has been the revival of
Russian imperialist ambitions. Throughout the 1990s the Western powers
set the agenda, incorporating Central European and Baltic states into
the EU and NATO, and all the time holding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus at
arm's length outside their integration project. From around 2000 [Putin
began to restore Russia's position]{.underline} as a power in Eurasia.
He [focussed first on rebuilding Russia's economic ties]{.underline} in
the ex-Soviet space [by reclaiming state control over Russian energy and
mineral resources]{.underline} and promoting several national corporate
champions in these sectors. Later, the restored economic links with
Russia's near abroad would lay a path to securing transnational
competitive status for Russia's biggest energy and mineral producers. 3
In terms of strategy, though not of scale, the Russian model of
imperialism is similar to that of the USA in the 20th century: the
[provision of military security to countries in exchange
for]{.underline} their alignment with Russian foreign policy, and their
access to Russian markets in exchange for the [**removal of barriers
against Russian capital penetrating their national
economies**.]{.underline} It is different from the USA experience
insofar as Russian expansion has relied on its competitive advantages in
global markets of fuel, energy and mineral resources whereas American
capitalism expanded globally with a far more diversified production base
and with already saturated domestic demand. The Russian economy is
weakly driven by domestic demand, and it does not satisfy it. It is not
diversified nor is its bourgeoisie willing to invest significantly in
its diversification. Property ownership in Russia is too insecure,
access to domestic resources and markets is in the gift of state
authorities, and better security and better investment opportunities
exist for Russian capital investment abroad. Therefore, while the
Russian national economy is not diversified, Russian capital has become
diversified both sectorally and geographically along transnational
chains of production, trade and investment. A Deutsche Bank report in
2008 concluded that Russia had become by 2006 the largest outward
investor of its capital of all the BRIC countries. Russian overseas
direct investment (ODI) was double that of its nearest rivals India and
China at USD\$160 bn, up from USD\$20bn in 2000. Russia was already the
second largest source of ODI in emerging markets after Hong Kong.
Russian private capital was invested first in the near abroad and then
expanded outwards, seeking new markets, financing and new technologies
principally in the fields of fuel, energy and metals A survey of 25 top
Russian firms shows they sent 52% of the ODI into Western Europe,
followed by 22% to the near abroad countries and 11% to Eastern Europe.
Several Russian companies, including Evraz, Severstal, Lukoil and
Gazprom, made new large purchases abroad in 2008: in Ukraine, Belarus,
Italy, Canada and the United States. At The other big transnational
corporations of Russian origin at the time were Sistema, Sovkomflot,
Norilsk Nickel and Basic Element. By 2010 ODI by Russian firms exceeded
USD\$200bn, and was going mainly to the CIS and EU countries 4 For the
past fifteen years Russia has targeted Ukraine for reabsorption into its
traditional sphere of influence. [There was an ongoing desire to
preserve joint production in engineering, defense, aerospace and other
high technology sectors]{.underline} that survived the Soviet break-up.
But [**Russian capitalism was looking to new horizons as well, and
Ukraine lay along its principal path of expansion** into Central and
Western Europe.]{.underline} It holds the downstream transit facilities
and processing industries that Russian energy, minerals and chemical
producers need. Russian producers made their first such cross border
acquisitions in 2000. 5

#### The Ukrainian crisis is undergirded by imperialist claims to control

I have not ventured into the period since the start of [the
war]{.underline} in the east. It [has been marked by]{.underline} many
thousands dead and injured in the fighting- more civilians than
soldiers, a humanitarian crisis in the occupied territories 45 , an
exodus of a million, now internally and externally displaced people,
[a]{.underline} [deepening economic and social crisis throughout the
country]{.underline}, the imposition of western sanctions against
Russia, rising nationalisms in Russia and Ukraine, military exercises
and mobilisations by Russia and NATO across Eastern Europe. They amount
to further escalation and widening of the conflict. In this article I
have tried to show [**it is not enough to examine the actions of the big
powers** in order to understand how this crisis began]{.underline}.
[Its]{.underline} tap **[root grows out of the historical experience of
Ukrainian society and their state.]{.underline}** It is the first and
necessary condition for the activation of all the other roots. So too
will [the solution]{.underline} to the crisis grow out of Ukraine. It
**[will have to confront the failure of the contemporary ruling
class]{.underline}** to fulfil the popular expectations arising from the
attainment of independence in 1991 for prosperity, social justice,
democracy and national self determination. And while the first three of
these expectations were denied by the Ukrainian ruling class, the
present war with Russia shows this same class is incapable of defending
its country's national independence. The current situation powerfully
echoes the two previous attempts in history -- in 1648 and 1917 -- when
a new social class tried but failed to build an independent state
centred on Kyiv and the Dnipro River basin. Will the same happen again?
Will Ukraine be reduced again to territory contested by the Great
Powers? [Russia, the USA and the West European states all bear
responsibility for their parts in this crisis.]{.underline} I have tried
to show here that [the political economy of Ukraine is stretched across
a reknitted transnational capitalist economy]{.underline} [in which
Russia on the one hand and the **Western powers** on the other **are
vying to draw Ukraine's ruling class**]{.underline}, national market and
productive assets **[into their respective integration
projects]{.underline}**. Despite trying for a quarter century, the
Ukrainian state has been unable to gain membership in the political and
military-security institutions of the Western, Euroatlantic project.
Over the same period it has been refusing to join equivalent
institutions of the Russia-led project. My findings draw attention to
the revival of Russian imperialism since 2000, the divisions in the
Western alliance over policy towards Russia, and the diminished capacity
of the USA to project its own power into the region. These three factors
steadily altered the balance of power in Eastern Europe between these
competing regional integration projects. The collapse of the Yanukovych
regime gave Russia's leaders the opportunity to exploit the changing
balance, return to the initiative and try to draw Ukraine back into its
own sphere. Russia militarised and iternationalised the crisis. It
provoked the Western powers to respond with economic sanctions and
strengthening NATO's capacity of its member states bordering Russia and
Ukraine. Both the Western powers and Russia have pressed the Ukrainian
leadership to engage with the separatist movement and seek a negotiated
solution with them. The harder it is pressed the less becomes the room
for its manoeuvre between them. [Whether it is Russia or the Western
powers who claim Ukraine as part of their own sphere **this can only be
an imperialist claim**]{.underline}. One or another faction of the
Ukrainian ruling class may submit to such a claim, or even to a joint
Russia-West tutelage over the country. Sooner or later their common
class interests will lead them to it. But it will not be accepted by the
Ukrainian people, nor should it be by those who want to support them
around the world.

#### Geopolitical relations with Ukraine are [fundamentally entrenched]{.underline} in neoliberal kleptocracy -- that [turns the case]{.underline} and makes the aff's impacts inevitable [absent the alt]{.underline}.

Per aspera ad nebulae or to market through a hybrid civil war: survival
myths of systemic failure Three years into its deepest crisis since the
demise of the USSR, Ukraine is on a brink of yet another Maidan.
Weakened by civil armed conflict, corrupt state administration apparatus
and paralysed by the excesses of the debt burden, [Ukraine\'s economy is
showing few signs of recovery]{.underline} while it continues to
[accumulate loans]{.underline} with increasingly draconian structural
adjustment requirements. Simultaneously, the [living standard, poverty
and inequality are at their worst to date]{.underline}. The combination
of [ill-prescribed market transition reforms, loaned funds mismanagement
and misappropriation by the kleptocratic ruling bloc have resulted in a
toxic debt dependency that has become a tool for manipulation in the
**renewed geopolitical confrontation between Russia and the USA/EU.**
Debt geopolitics]{.underline} in the context of the Deep and
Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTA) negotiations [have cost Ukraine
its residual de facto sovereignty and at the same time continue to
undermine possibilities for stabilisation of the geopolitical
order.]{.underline} **[Ukraine is stuck in a vice of authoritarian
neoliberal kleptocracy with fascicisation tendencies]{.underline}**.
Further implementation of DCFTA means [more **austerity**, more
**inequality**, more **privatisation**, and **fewer support mechanisms
for** everyday social reproduction via access to **health care,
childcare, education, affordable utilities and food**]{.underline}. The
privatisation of land and re-privatisation of fracking fields also means
an **[ecological catastrophe]{.underline}**. The liberalisation on
exports of timber to the EU already spells the destruction of Carpathian
centuries-old forests for short-term economic gain. **[Debt has become a
geopolitical tool in Ukraine\'s foreign relations to be used sparingly
by its lenders.]{.underline}** Exploration of the post-2013/2m4 extremes
of foreign debt dependency show that the latter, **[in the context of
the kleptocratic neoliberal regime, has led to an effective erosion of
Ukraine\'s sovereignty that by now barely hinges upon the dangerous
rhetoric of \'patriotism, that is, the infusion of right-wing sentiment
as a defensive mechanism against any criticism of the shaky oligarchic
kingdom.]{.underline}** Crimea is not likely to be returned peacefully
soon; nor is the Donbas conflict likely to be reconciled in the
immediate future. What is certain is that **[authoritarian fascicising
neoliberal kieptocracy is increasingly dis-possessing and alienating the
country\'s labour beyond the limits of the possible that are necessary
for everyday social reproduction.]{.underline}** As even the so-called
\'right-wing patriots\' are being disposed of as the enemies of the
system in Poroshenko\'s address to the parliament this September, social
discontent is brewing stronger. [This dispossessed labour force is
awake; it is aching from the freshly inflicted wounds and covered in the
blood of its children; it is armed; and it is desperate. It is pregnant
with the next Maidan.]{.underline} In early 2014, when Ukraine became
the frontline story of global media, few understood how pro-European
Union association demonstrations had turned into armed clashes. The
unprecedented violence that shook the country was alarming in that the
extreme destabilisation of the increasingly dispossessed society brought
to center stage the geopolitical contestations that many thought had
been left behind in the pre-1989 era. [Speculations of a new Cold War,
imperialistic clashes, and even looming Third World War flooded the
discourse space of mass media, politics and academicians,\' which more
often than not contributed to the misunderstanding of the
crisis]{.underline}.2 **[The conflict did not start with the first
bullets fired in Kyiv in the winter of 2014]{.underline}**. Putin\'s
ambitions, Nuland\'s leaked cables, Biden\'s visits, McCain\'s and
Tymoshenko\'s inopportune NATO comments, and the like have had little
power to automatically translate into an armed conflict. [The conditions
had to be right. The bullets and the rest burst the floodgates of
discontent that have been brewing for some 25 years and that were
stirred by a set of dangerous myths in and of the post-Soviet
space]{.underline}. The [myths were a product of minds that were
unwilling and often incapable of engaging with the social or economic
reality of those whose future they dangerously had the most power to
shape**.**]{.underline} In this book, I show that the story of
[**Ukraine\'s degeneration** into a hybrid civil and armed conflict **is
the story of ill-conceived myths used as foundations for real life
politico-economic transformation** and the dangers that that process
entails]{.underline}. All myths are social constructs, which are created
by people and exist for their specific purpose.\' *The **[underlying
purpose and effects of the myths that have been shaping Ukraine\'s
transformation since 1991 are the securing of expansion of the empire of
transnationalising capital. It is precisely the social effects of that
complex process that have produced conditions where the civil
confrontation and the armed conflict became possible and it is the
investigation of that process that is the task of this
book.]{.underline}*** The function of myths in a [changing political and
economic reality is to produce social cohesion, support, or - in the
words of Gramsci4 - to a specific mode of governance, production and
social reproduction]{.underline}. The [mode that since the 1975 has
underpinned the global political economy is that of
neoliberalism]{.underline} or financialised capitalism, which since the
financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the ensuing recession has only become
further entrenched,5 and [has been assuming overtly authoritarian
features]{.underline}.6 The most prominent aspect of the latter are the
ongoing **[finan-cialisation and enclosures,7 that is, the privatisation
of publicly owned assets and the assaults on social welfare
provision]{.underline}**. Market-based con-stitutionalism is the new
world order\' where we see the socialisation of corporate losses9
combined with extreme disciplining in the workplace\" and systemic
social exclusion of labour\" with added extortion by indebtedness,\' i n
-work povertr and austerity policies. All of the above are popular and
successful exports from the core of the capitalist system to its
semi-/peripheries to which Ukraine is no exception, as I will show in
this book. The [expansion of the global capitalist system]{.underline}
to the post-Soviet space since the early 199os has created a [pronounced
intensification of trans-national class struggles]{.underline} and East
West geopolitical tensions - primarily [between the USA and
Russia]{.underline}. Weakened by the demise of the USSR and later
economically strengthened by the industrialised world\'s dependence on
oil and gas, Russia became a state-run oligarchy that entered into [a
new competition with the USA, this time without a proper ideological
component.]{.underline} Since the late 19905, the Kremlin\'s aim has
been to beat the USA at their own game, the capitalist competition/world
dominance game; that has included, among other aspects, economic,
political and military control over the post-Soviet states, which were
slipping away from Moscow\'s gravitational pull one after another. The
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS; founded in 1991), the
Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO; founded 1992, reformed in
2002), and the more recent formation of the Eurasian Customs I.:Ilion in
2008 are some of the examples of Russia\'s attempts to re-establish and
maintain dominance over the space it often used to control directly,
even before the formation of the USSR. The [USA\'s push to spread NATO
to Eastern Europe and Russia\'s military involvement in Transnistria and
Abkhazia are also part of the Washington-Moscow geopolitical
game]{.underline}. The effective [manufacturing of frozen conflicts in
Moldova and Georgia led some to interpret Putin\'s annexation of Crimea
and the military incursion into Eastern Ukraine as a reaction to fears
over the expansion of NATO too]{.underline}.\" What advocates of
Russia\'s right to defend its interests\' 5 fail to acknowledge is that
[Ukraine is a sovereign state and that Russia\'s disagreement with its
foreign and trade policy choices does not grant the Kremlin rights to
violate Ukraine\'s borders.]{.underline} Nor does it justify the
trans-formation of Russia\'s mainstream political discourse that, since
the early 2000s, has been based on a bizarre mix of the resurrected and
glorified imperial past and reinforced pride over monopolised credit for
the Soviet Second World War victory. The use of the imperial history of
\'ownership\' of Crimea combined with the need to protect ethnic
Russians as a pretext for military incursion into Ukraine speaks of the
Kremlin\'s imperialist ambitions: the rhetoric of geopolitical
self-defence is hard to sustain in the light of such \'diplomacy\' And
indeed, the imperialist clashes of the West and East extend beyond the
post-Soviet states and into the interna-tional military and economic
arena. The confrontations between Russia and the West/USA over Libya and
Syria in the UN are just some of the many illustrations of those clashes
and their recent intensification. The long and complex historical
relationship with Russian Empire and the then Soviet Russia secured
Ukraine a special place in the renewed geopolitical confrontation.
Internally, the state-building process was complicated by the legacy of
centuries of being divided between east and west, empires and forms of
social organisation intermeshed with brief periods of sovereign
statehood.\'6 Unified in its current borders by the Soviets in
mid-twentieth century, the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multilingual
nation needed a strong cosmopolitan foundation myth to bring it into a
sovereign existence.\'? The pivotal principles of the country\'s
Constitution, adopted in 1996, contained all the required ingredients
for that. However, [marketisation and geopolitical games in the
post-Soviet space were in contradiction with the potential construction
of a cosmopolitan, egalitarian society and thus, different, divisive
myths were used to shape public imagination.]{.underline} **[A regime of
neoliberal ideptocracy, where typical neoliberal features are
exacerbated by omnipresent corruption and institutionalised state asset
embezzlement, emerged]{.underline}**.\" The **[country found itself
placed into a vice of neoliberal kleptocracy and intensified
geopolitical tensions. The effective dispossession of the masses and the
manipulative divisive political myths used to manufacture consent to the
regime of dispossession have continuously eroded social cohesion since
the early 1990s.]{.underline}** Complex and far-reaching historical
processes do not simply happen. There are social forces and people with
names who drive them in specific directions. It is through the
identification of those forces and the identification of their main
interests that we can understand the reasons behind their strategic
choices, however questionable those may appear - as at first it may seem
to be in the case of Ukraine. **[One must look into the relationships
between the systemic transformation of Ukraine as a part of the changing
global capitalist system, associated geopolitical shifts and the class
formation process, for example, the emergence of oligarchy, on the level
of ideology and the changing individual material positioning towards the
means of production in the process of privatisa-tion, that is,
accumulation by dispossession.]{.underline}** In this book, I show how
the **[problematic integration of Ukraine into the global capitalist
system has fertilised internal political destabilisation, while
simultaneously fuelling geopolitical tensions in the region, thus making
the civil and armed conflict possible]{.underline}**. The abstract
separation of civil and armed conflicts is crucial here as political
divisions are currently as rife in the country as are their armed
expressions, while civil-political conflicts exist on and extend beyond
the frontline of Eastern Ukraine.

### Explains/RC Yemen

#### Global capitalist forces [manifest]{.underline} in resource struggles that [trigger]{.underline} war---best explains the War in Yemen

**Blumi 18** (Isa, historian, senior lecturer and associate professor of
Turkish Studies at Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies in
Sweden, "Essay: Yemen's destruction, a global catastrophe," TRT World,
10/3/18,
<https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/essay-yemen-s-destruction-a-global-catastrophe-20640>,
JLin)

The war in Yemen is far more than just a political struggle. The
political struggle does not even begin to capture a fraction of what the
conflict is really about. [**The war on Yemen today is a brutal example
of how the expansion of global capitalist interests destroys nations**.
It first takes the form of neoliberalism (often innocently labeled as
globalisation) and then, as the inevitable structural collapse of the
targeted country begins,]{.underline} (with its inevitable popular
resistance undermining the political order), a more overt form of
[violence is introduced.]{.underline} Yemen's recent retelling of an
oft-repeated story is something to which those in other countries, even
countries as powerful as Turkey, should pay heed to. This war on Yemen
may have been first predicted by an American Ambassador representing the
Obama administration. As Washington reacted negatively to a popular
uprising against economic "reforms" it's neoconservative and Clintonite
cliques threatened Yemenis with financial destruction via the
devaluation of their national currency, the Rial. The origins of the war
The war itself is officially the responsibility of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), leading a campaign sanctioned by the UN and IMF to
reinstall the 2012 imposed "transitional government" led by Abdrabbuh
Mansur [Had]{.underline}i, an old Yemeni political hand. His
"[government" had the short-term mandate of imposing economic austerity
after the previous government]{.underline}---that had agreed to insert
these "reforms"---was overthrown by popular revolt. This was Yemen's
brief contribution to the "Arab Spring". The formula of this supposedly
interim government under Hadi devastated the country within the first
few months of its enforcement. It was the violent austerity such
economic policies imposed on Yemeni people that has animated the
resistance to globalism (and thus the endurance of the war). Crucially,
what Yemen's people revolted against in 2010-2011, and again in 2014,
were the kinds of austerity and structural adjustments that were also
recently made on Greece. As elsewhere in the world, IMF-imposed
austerity hurt the poorest of Yemen's population, whose suffering
matched those of Egypt's and Tunisia's masses prior to 2011. **[For
Yemen, victims of globalisation found a champion in the resistance
movement]{.underline}** emerging from the cities and villages of
northern Yemen. Long associated with a charismatic spiritual leader,
incorrectly labeled "the Houthis", this populist outburst remained
intact by late 2014 [and orchestrated a successful second campaign to
again **remove the international regime of global
capitalism**.]{.underline} The destruction The numbers of victims of
what must be seen as globalism's war are staggering. More than 63,000
children died in 2016 alone (the last year UNICEF dared to count).
Up-to-date statistics are even more horrific. According to a September
21st report to the United Nations produced by the UN's Office of the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of 2018, 18 million people are
food insecure and 8 million are "severely" food insecure in Yemen. On
top of this starvation, the outbreak of cholera in the war-torn country
is likely the worst in human history. In other words, Yemen constitutes
the world's largest humanitarian disaster that receives little to no
media coverage. [One explanation for why most media refuse to report
this war is the fact that the slaughter was largely directed out of
US/UK command centers. It has been **the Western empires that organised
hit-lists since the beginning of this war**.]{.underline} Criminal
intent? In fact, the first week of the bombing campaign that started in
March 2015, was already a window into the criminal intent of the
American-maintained Qatari and Saudi jets. Targeting food storage
facilities, farms, food processing plants, water tanks and bridges, the
aim was no doubt to put pressure on the millions of civilian Yemenis and
accomplish what the former ambassador's threats did not. Unfortunately
for agents of globalism, [the Yemeni people still openly revolt against
efforts to impose economic and political "order" over Yemen. The war
today is the frantic attempt to reverse a popular uprising against
imposed economic devastation.]{.underline} The GCC partners who formed
the heart of the "coalition" to enforce Yemen's compliance at the time
were Qatar and Saudi Arabia (and their EU and US partners). This
"coalition" sanctioned by the UN used violence, by way of mercenaries.
Crucially, this violence that targets civilians and wields righteous
"international law" as its legitimising bludgeon, is nothing new. As I
painfully conclude in my study, Destroying Yemen: What Chaos in Arabia
Tells Us about the World (2018), the current destruction of Yemen
constitutes but the latest wave of violence used to sequester the
country's wealth. [**Blessed with the region's richest human resources,
massive untapped oil/gas, mineral, water, and fishery wealth, Yemen has
been the target of globalists since at least the 1920s.**]{.underline}
With this in mind, it becomes even more clear that the origins of war in
the larger Middle East today needs to be read through a new analytical
filter. Economic war Ever since the 1990s, the global economy has
incrementally shifted. [The petrodollar, once enabling the American
Empire to finance endless wars, has been undermined by a growing crisis
in liquidity. The **resulting desperate search for new sources of
capital animates the globalists' drive to violently subdue the Middle
East**]{.underline} today. Once attractive "emerging markets" offering
investors desperate for higher returns a "sure thing" have become
over-leveraged. The resulting crash and scramble to reverse a trend that
sees much of the world's savings shift away from the West has left much
of New York and London exposed. Western equity markets and banks broadly
speaking are now desperate to siphon off the last of the world's liquid
wealth before it is forever absorbed by Asia or Africa. This campaign
implicates members of the GCC long responsible for assisting in
redirecting much of the trillions earned from oil and gas industries
back to the West. What has remained an unspoken rivalry between members
of this false alliance, simmering for years, has exploded over Yemen.
Here, then, is the critical concern for observers moving forward. What
animates the calculations of those waging war on parts of Yemen requires
an appreciation for the geostrategic concerns of participants otherwise
assumed to be aligned in a "coalition" led by Saudi Arabia. [America's
favoured Kingdom, itself, is a financial wreck. Unable to find new
sources of investment]{.underline} (even its once cherished ARAMCO can't
attract the foreign capital needed to keep the corrupt family afloat),
[an invasion and rapid sequestration of Yemen's natural resources in
underpopulated South Yemen was deemed a necessary gamble.]{.underline}
The problem here is [that Yemenis despise the Saudi enterprise and have
resisted this latest campaign to steal their country's wealth most
violently.]{.underline} By 1990, when a newly unified Yemeni state was
created, the anger was in response to a state increasingly serving the
interests of the General People's Party (GPC). From its Sana'a' base,
centered around the personality of Ali Abdullah Salih, the GPC had
corruptly formed lucrative, temporary alliances with pliable local
leaders' like the Ahmar family and Abdul Majid al Zindani who all
secured parallel ties to the United States, various EU countries, and
rival GCC states. As noted in my book, the evolution of these ties
ultimately served an agenda that pushed Yemenis into a regime of
"development" that increasingly pushed for the the country's plunder. In
short, as in other "emerging market" economies, Yemeni leaders offered
the best of Yemen's economic assets for lease or outright purchase. In
this period of rapid "integration" into the global economy, applauded by
the IMF and US Embassy, a race began between rival actors seeking the
lion's share of Yemen's valuable assets. Western bankers and their
allies in the Gulf were the primary speculators. As with all money from
the global south, in the form of savings and investments, whether poured
into property markets in Dubai, Istanbul, or Beirut, regional actors and
their London-based advisors hoped Yemen would be the stage to the next
boom economy. To many with the proper knowledge, Yemen's largely
untapped natural resources---especially its oil/gas, minerals, and
fisheries---promised the country was going to be the next big thing.
[**The roots of the current destruction of Yemen was established in this
context of investment in Yemen**. The resulting conflict pitted key
actors within Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates against
each other.]{.underline} As the three primary centers of finance in
Arabia all directed resources into Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Qatar applied
a tried-and-true tool of coercion to poison the religious underbelly of
Yemen's diverse population. By the late 1990s, Southern Arabia was
littered with al-Qaeda affiliates, a threat to the United Arab Emirates.
The subsequent sectarianism visiting other parts of the region by the
2000s brought Yemen to its 2011 political meltdown. Lessons to learn The
foundations of the current catastrophe in Yemen, however, cannot be
entirely blamed on the intra-GCC struggle over regional ascendency.
Recent reports of former and present government officials advocating war
in Yemen have clearly sought to benefit certain industries to which they
were affiliated. Such barely reported "scandals" highlight the obvious
links between US policy and major companies in the weapons, oil/gas,
logistics, and financial industries. Indeed, [war in Yemen can be seen
as a campaign by these industries, through corrupt American
officials]{.underline}, to shift what appears to be the last bits of GCC
savings into the greedy hands of the financial elite. The now obvious
war pitting Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE against each other in Yemen,
threatens to undermine any ability of other regional players, including
Turkey, to make necessary adjustments moving forward. Any collapse of
the Saudi leadership threatens dramatic changes in Arabia's political
economic order. By necessity, this shift has the heavy hand of global
financial interests attempting to control the outcome, a precarious
intervention that calculates Turkey's new relations with Russia as a
possible pretext for the next violent confrontation in the region.
Therefore, the destruction of a regional order that has been shaped by
an oil economy since World War II requires deep consideration. I believe
a gaze into the origins of the campaign to destroy Yemen is one resource
from which leaders can draw. For over a century, [**Yemenis have
resisted a global capitalist machine**]{.underline} that today is
threatening to break down. Ironically, it was Yemen that educated
high-level Ottomans about the limits of modern government. [Perhaps
responsible leaders]{.underline} today can also consider what lessons
they can draw from Yemen and hopefully [avoid the impending disaster
that awaits those too closely linked to a collapsing Western-centered
capitalist order]{.underline} ensnared in southern Arabia's destruction.

[Yemeni cities over the decades gave a vivid illustration of the
worsening gap between the small wealthy elite]{.underline} and the
increasing number of destitute people. In the early 1990s, there were a
few beggars at traffic lights and most people travelled by bus or in
crowded four-wheel drives. By 2010, people could buy more or less
anything portable while waiting for the lights to change: not just
newspapers, books and cassettes, but household equipment, clothes,
cleaning tools and more. Dozens of hawkers walked along the queues of
mini-buses, cars and other vehicles including the latest model fancy
expensive 'tape à l'oeil' motors driven by the young -- sometimes even
underage -- sons of the super wealthy. By then sellers were not only
low-status akhdam but also impoverished tribes men, women and children,
reduced to such demeaning activities by desperation. However bad and
deteriorating the situation may have been in the first two decades of
the Republic of Yemen, [there is no doubt that the decade starting in
2011 has seen a dramatic worsening.]{.underline} [The country's economic
prospects were dealt a sharp and deep blow within months of the
establishment of the state in 1990]{.underline}, when Sana'a's reaction
to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait led to Yemen's isolation. External
financial support from all sources was reduced to almost nothing and the
return of more than 800,000 Yemenis from the GCC states (Saudi Arabia in
particular) instantly eliminated the remittances on which their
households depended. In addition[, the state had to take responsibility
for these people, many of whom returned destitute]{.underline}. They had
been away for generations, hence had nowhere to return to. Before the
economy could recover, political tensions led to the 1994 civil war
which caused considerable destruction in Aden and was a further blow to
economic prospects, because of both the cost of reconstruction and an
increasing lack of confidence among potential foreign investors. The
Aden Free Zone, established in early 1991, never really took off, and
the city's status as economic capital was little more than a propaganda
ploy. [Instead of entering the era of prosperity Yemenis were hoping
for, the new state lurched from one crisis to another, **culminating in
the full-scale war** starting in early 2015.]{.underline} [Its weak
economic base deteriorated due to the rapacious policies of the ruling
clique combined with government implementation of Washington Consensus
'development' strategies and very limited external financial
support]{.underline}. It finally collapsed with Yemen's transformation
into a war economy, marked by continued predation. [Poverty
rates]{.underline}, which were already officially high, [have
rocketed]{.underline}. Yemen's limited natural resources and rapid
population growth are partly responsible for worsening poverty since
unification, and the political situation has intensified an already bad
situation. **[Neo-liberal economic policies]{.underline}** promoted by
the IMF, and slavishly followed by most bilateral financiers, **[have

Since 2015, Yemen has been enduring a brutal attack by the Saudi
military and their allies. According to Yemen's Sana'a-based Legal
Centre for Rights and Democracy, 11,929 people have died as a result of
the Saudi offensive, including over 2500 children. Hundreds of medical
facilities have been destroyed. According to Medecins Sans Frontieres,
"Less than half of the country's medical facilities are still
functioning." This, and the devastation to infrastructure caused by the
bombing, has resulted in a devastating cholera outbreak, which has so
far claimed the lives of nearly 2000 people, with 500,000 more also
infected. Genesis of the crisis The [Saudi aggression in Yemen has its
roots in the Saudi rulers' wish to politically dominate the region and
to regain control in the wake of]{.underline} the people's [movements
for democracy and freedom]{.underline} that arose out of the
Middle-Eastern and North African uprisings -- known as the Arab Spring
-- that began in 2011. In 2011, inspired by the people's uprisings in
Tunisia and Egypt, Yemenis rose up against President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
He was forced to flee to Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital, and never
returned to office, but instead handed the presidency to his deputy,
Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. However in January 2015, Zaidi-Shia Houthi
rebels advanced on Sana'a. Hadi was forced to resign and, like Saleh
before him, fled to Riyadh. Once Hadi was safely in Riyadh, he rescinded
his resignation, and announced his intention to set up a temporary
government in the Yemeni city of Aden. Saudi's rulers were not willing
to allow their ally to be toppled by a Shia force, which they allege to
be supported by Iran, their main opponent in the region. Rather than let
this happen, Saudi Arabia began airstrikes and a ground invasion on 26
March 2015. A war for money and power [Part of the motivation for the
Saudi alliance's continued invasion is, of course, **power and money.**
The war being carried out by Saudi Arabia and its alliance in Yemen is
**intended to benefit Saudi capitalism by reasserting its regional
dominance, dominating strategic ports and creating a captive market for
investment and consumer goods** for Saudi and its allies. The war in
Yemen may also be motivated by a **wish to maximise profits from the
export of oil by eliminating the competition**]{.underline}. According
to Ryan Riegg of the Lawyerence of Arabia writing group, [Saudi Arabia
would benefit from disrupting or controlling "the Bab Al Mandeb
Strait]{.underline} (BAM) [and/or chokepoints in the Red
Sea,]{.underline} through [which Qatar and Iran ship nearly all their
natural gas to Europe". This could be achieved by expanding the war in
Yemen.]{.underline} Backing up this argument, in 2017 Saudi Arabia began
an economic blockade of Qatar, demanding it shuts down the Al Jazeera
news network and severs links to groups including Hezbollah -- the
Iran-backed Lebanese Shia movement -- and the Muslim Brotherhood. At the
same time, Qatar was removed from the Saudi-led coalition attacking
Yemen. Power struggle with Iran Saudi Arabia is a Wahabi--Sunni Islamist
state, ruled by an autocratic monarchy. Saudi state nationalism is
constructed around Wahabi-Sunni theocratic ideology. As such, the regime
sees the Shia state of Iran as a threat to its domination of the region,
and it sees the region's Shia inhabitants as potential allies of Iran.
Although the Saudi rulers are Sunni, 10% of the Saudi population is, in
fact, Shia. And yet, the regime is currently engaged in a deadly attack
on them in Awamiya (inside its own borders). Similarly, the Sunni regime
in neighbouring Bahrain, a de-facto Saudi client-state, was backed up
with Saudi military force against the popular uprising of 2011, and
continues to rule over an overwhelmingly Shia population. This, coupled
with the Iranian state's support for Shia political movements, means
that Saudi Arabia sees the violent repression of these movements as a
key part of enforcing its hegemony in the region. This is why the
seizure of power by the Houthi Shia-Zaidi rebels was met by such a
violent response. However, [this doesn't mean that the invasion is
motivated, either wholly or principally, by religious differences, as
Western mainstream media often imply. Instead, **sectarianism is used by
the Saudi regime to justify waging colonial wars intended to assert
Saudi dominance and benefit Saudi capitalism.**]{.underline}

[The domination of Filipino society by a powerful oligarchy is a factor
that greatly augments the scope for extrajudicial killings]{.underline},
[particularly when taken into account with **the adoption of
neoliberalism by the state**.]{.underline} Harvey (2005, p. 19)
described neoliberalism as a project to 'restore the power of economic
elites'. [The archipelago has always been dominated by an oligarchy that
established its power through the production]{.underline} and export of
agricultural products (Hawes 1987). President Aquino is well ensconced
within this oligarchy with his family owning Hacienda Luisita where
seven sugar workers protesting for land reform were killed, while 72
others were injured, during 2004 (Sales 2009). **[This oligarchy stands
to benefit immensely from neoliberalism with its disdain for
redistributive policies such as land reform]{.underline}** (Bello et al.
2009). The 'economic freedom' that comes with neoliberalism offers a
tremendous opportunity for the enhancement of the power in society held
by this oligarchy. As Peet and Hartwick (2009, p. 100) wrote: Clearly
the neoliberals \[were\] not talking about workers in factories, nor
women in families, nor peasants on plantations. They \[meant\], by the
free individual, the entrepreneur, the capitalist, the boss. And they
\[meant\], by freedom, the opportunity to make money, which buys
everything (except happiness). These theorists \[were\] against the
state because it may limit the freedom of the rich to make more money,
and it might redistribute existing wealth. [When activists object to
neoliberal policies,]{.underline} such as trade liberalisation, [they
are also attempting to thwart the power of the oligarchy and this makes
them vulnerable to acts of state terrorism]{.underline}, because 'the
Philippine state operates in the interests of the bourgeoisie and
against the interests of workers and small landowners' (Hawes 1987, p.
133). [A crucial function of the capitalist state is ensuring the
political disorganisation of subordinate classes so they are unable to
overcome economic isolation]{.underline} and are therefore unable to
threaten the interests of the dominant class (Blakeley 2009).
Consequently, [state terrorism is 'primarily and illegitimately, a means
of protecting the interests of elites]{.underline}' (Blakeley 2009, p.
164). The AFP: armed forces of the elite The AFP has had no problem with
allowing the interests of the oligarchy to be strengthened through
neoliberalism's disregard for redistributive policies, because the AFP
has always acted as the armed forces of the elite and has never
displayed any economic nationalism or acted on behalf of the poor and
marginalised (McCoy 2009). The old Philippine Constabulary was the
principal mechanism of law enforcement in the islands from American
colonial times until its replacement by the Philippine National Police
in 1991; Kerkvliet (1977, p. 54) described the Philippine Constabulary
as 'practically an army for the landed elites'. Critical Studies on
Terrorism 2011.4:331-350. 346 W.N. Holden State terrorism: a necessary
corollary to neoliberalism? Is state terrorism necessary for
neoliberalism? It has not been uncommon for state repression to
accompany efforts to implement neoliberal policies where there has been
substantial opposition to these. Nevertheless, there are many developing
countries where neoliberal policies have been implemented without the
state resorting to assassinations of its citizens. What sets the
Philippines apart from these other countries is that the Philippine
government is attempting to implement neoliberal policies concomitant
with eliminating a Maoist insurgency.6 Maoism is antithetical to
neoliberalism and the latter regards the former as an 'anachronism' that
should no longer exist now that 'history has ended' (Fukuyama 1989, p.
12). This is where Phoenix, with its prescription of destroying
insurgent infrastructure, can be appealing to neoliberals as it
facilitates the destruction of an orthogonal political programme. As
Moyar (2007, p. 336), a Phoenix apologist, stated, 'Implementing a
political program before destroying the enemy's infrastructure, in fact,
is quite difficult because the enemy cadres can obstruct it through
intimidation, violence, and propaganda.' Given such use of Phoenix, it
is no surprise that Valentine (2000, p. 429) wrote that one can 'look
for Phoenix in the imaginations of ideologues obsessed with security,
who seek to impose their way of thinking on everyone else'. Conclusion:
state terrorism, a critical study of terrorism Terrorism is often
portrayed as being the product of amorphous non-state groups acting to
undermine the freedom and prosperity associated with the social order
established under neoliberalism. A classic example of this was the
statement by George W. Bush, on 11 September 2001, that 'today, freedom
was attacked'. In contrast to this, [terrorism is often carried out by
states acting to implement neoliberalism as opposed to non-state groups
acting to destroy it]{.underline}. Neoliberalism is an ideology with no
regard for anything even resembling communism**[. In the Philippines,
the government has pursued a neoliberal agenda and has engaged in
ruthless state terrorism to crush those perceived as impediments to its
implementation]{.underline}**. The template for this was the Phoenix
Program, a programme of selective assassinations designed by the United
States to destroy the infrastructure of the Viet Cong. Tactics used by
the Phoenix Program were replicated in US counterinsurgency tactics in
Latin America. They have also found their way into the methods of the
AFP. This is through the heavy influence of the US military upon the
AFP. There are striking similarities between Phoenix and OPLAN Bantay
Laya. Indeed, it appears that elements of Phoenix were being replicated
by the AFP during the 2001--2010 time period; as the title of the
article suggests 'the fingerprints of Phoenix' are obvious. [The
extrajudicial killings were an example of state terrorism.]{.underline}
State terrorism requires a critical reappraisal of the way terrorism is
approached. Terrorism is not just designed and implemented by nebulous
and nefarious 'others' acting to undermine and destroy the best social
order ever known. Terrorism can also be designed and implemented by
those advocating neoliberalism. In conclusion, one must consider the
words of Oslender (2007, p. 127): It is therefore necessary to stand up
against the simplification of the 'terror concept' in contemporary
dominant geopolitical discourses that define terrorism exclusively as
directed against the Western neoliberal democratic state, while at the
same time hiding 'other terrorisms', including those applied by these
very same Western neoliberal democracies. It seems ironic, to say the
least, that the 'War on Terror', led by the United States and its
changing allies, actually helps to produce and sustain landscapes of
fear and regimes of terror.

The demarcation line between the EDSA Republic and its successor may not
be as dramatic as that separating the martial law regime from EDSA, it
is nevertheless clear: [an electoral insurgency propelled Duterte to the
presidency]{.underline} --- a figure [whose campaign was marked by a
provocative repudiation of the substance and discourse of liberal
democracy]{.underline} [that]{.underline} have [served as the
ideological scaffolding of the EDSA system. Central to this ideology has
been the liberal values of human rights and due process that were
institutionalised in the 1987 Constitution,]{.underline} which
crystallised the ideals of the struggle against the Marcos dictatorship.
Yet [Duterte\'s appeal to large numbers of voters lay precisely in his
sneering dismissal of these values. This turn was undoubtedly promoted
partly by the **fear of many citizens that the liberal democratic state
could no longer protect them from criminals, drug pushers and the
police.**]{.underline} It stemmed likewise from a widespread perception
that due process, far from ensuring justice, had turned into a system of
protection for the wayward, the corrupt and the powerful. But one must
also count as [a central explanation for Duterte\'s success the popular
disillusionment with the kind of democracy that the EDSA regime
delivered. The EDSA Uprising]{.underline} and its aftermath had
[promised a representative democracy more responsive to the
masses]{.underline}. The 1987 Constitution even institutionalising a

Constitution [promised "a more equitable distribution of opportunities,
income, and wealth".]{.underline} It would be an understatement to say
that [the]{.underline} EDSA [system failed to translate this promise
into reality]{.underline}. And for the lower classes that rallied around
him, [Duterte\'s main appeal was his populist pledge to shake up an
economic system whose rules and practices had condemned them to
permanent marginalization.]{.underline} Perhaps the key tragedy of [the
EDSA Republic]{.underline} was that it [**came into being right at the
time that neoliberalism was on the ascendant globally as an
ideology**.]{.underline} Even before the February 1986 uprising, the
**[Philippines had become one of four guinea pigs of the new structural
adjustment program unveiled by the World Bank, which aimed to bring down
tariffs, deregulate the economy, and privatise government
enterprises.]{.underline}** Under the administration of Cory Aquino,
pressure from the International Monetary Fund and US banks made
repayment of the foreign debt the top national economic priority. [Over
the next three decades, debt servicing would take up to 20 to 45% of the
annual government budget, crippling the government\'s capacity to invest
and stimulate economic growth and provide]{.underline} essential [social
services. With the 1992-98 administration]{.underline} of Fidel Ramos,
**[neoliberalism reached its apogee: tariffs were radically cut to
zero-to-five percent, deregulation and privatisation were sped
up,]{.underline}** and the Philippines joined the World Trade
Organisation --- [to]{.underline} "[benefit]{.underline}", it was said,
from the tide of [corporate-driven globalisation.]{.underline} Under
Ramos and later administrations, [the contours of the EDSA political
economy were consolidated: pro-market policies, relentless
privatisation, export-oriented development, export of labour, low wages
to attract foreign investors]{.underline} and conservative monetary and
fiscal management. As our neighbours retained high levels of economic
protectionism, **[neoliberal disarmament resulted in the Philippines\'
having the second lowest yearly average growth rate in Southeast Asia
from 1990 to 2010]{.underline}**. Even the second-tier ASEAN economies
of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Burma outstripped it. Although the
economy registered 6-7% growth rates from 2012 to 2015, [there was no
"trickle down" to counter the legacy of stagnation bequeathed by

#### Capitalism is the root cause of patriarchal, racist, and colonial violence.

Graduate Center, and at the College of Staten Island, City University of
New York, Extinction A Radical History, Chapter 3 'Capitalism and
Extinction,' 2016\] -TB

Capitalism's Degradation of the Environment [The tendency for capitalism
to degrade the conditions of its own production is shockingly evident in
the fur trade,]{.underline} one of the main forces that drove European
expansion after 1500. Aside from keeping wearers warm, fur clothes were
status symbols in early modern Europe. The right to wear fur was tightly
controlled by so-called sumptuary laws, which dictated that only people
of certain social rank were allowed to don luxurious clothes.
Nevertheless, as the mercantile bourgeoisie grew, the demand for furs
spiraled. Western Europe quickly destroyed most of its fur-bearing
mammals, and Russia began its long expansion eastward into Siberia,
where it collected furs as tribute from conquered peoples such as the
Tatars. By the sixteenth century, furs were the Russian state's largest
source of income. Siberian beavers, sables, and martens were driven to
the edge of extinction within two centuries.58 **[The insatiable demand
for fur consequently became one of the primary catalysts for European
colonization of the Americas.]{.underline}** Indeed, the French, Dutch,
and English development companies established to facilitate European
colonization of North America quickly realized that furs offered one of
the most convenient means for the colonists to remit value back to
Europe. Furs made fortunes for many European traders, who exchanged
common and relatively cheap manufactured items such as iron axe heads
with Native Americans for valuable beaver, deer, ermine, and other
pelts. **[Over time, the Native American tribes caught up in the fur
trade gradually abandoned their subsistent ways of life, becoming
integrated into the emerging capitalist world system as specialized
laborers working to harvest furs for European traders.]{.underline}**59
European traders barter with Native American hunters for furs. In
addition to transforming indigenous subsistence culture, the fur trade
catalyzed bloody conflicts between Native American tribes, including the
so-called Beaver Wars of the mid-17th century, in which the Dutch- and
Englishbacked Iroquois Confederation battled the predominantly
Algonquin-speaking tribes of the Great Lakes region, whom the French
supported. As beaver populations declined in places such as the Hudson
Valley due to over-hunting, tribes like the Mohawks clashed with their
neighbors to the north and west, where fur-bearing animals had not yet
been hunted to the brink of extinction. [The full human impact of these
wars is still largely unknown since they took place beyond the frontier
of European colonization, but they undoubtedly weakened the Native
American tribes of the Northeast, **making them more vulnerable to
subsequent settler colonial campaigns of expropriation and
extermination.**]{.underline} In addition, such inter-imperial
competition between the French and English led to higher prices for
pelts, which increased the incentive for unsustainable over-harvesting
of furs by European trappers and Native Americans. The fur trade
continued until after the American Revolution, helping to make John
Jacob Astor, owner of the monopolistic American Fur Company, into the
US's first multi-millionaire. But Astor, having played a prominent role
in decimating the continent's fur-bearing animals, abandoned the trade
for speculation in real estate early in the nineteenth century. Although
the beaver did not become extinct, its numbers were so reduced that it
was no longer viable to hunt commercially. Scarcely two hundred years
had passed since King Henry IV of France had granted the first charter
to a European fur trading company in North America. As Europe subjugated
other parts of the planet, it dramatically transformed, and in most
cases radically diminished, biodiversity of all kinds. In some cases,
this was unconscious. The expansion of Europe into the Americas took the
form of a great wave of novel biota, from smallpox and influenza viruses
to pigs and horses.60 Traveling alongside the European conquerors, these
invasive species often wreaked havoc in the New World, killing many
millions of Native Americans who had not been exposed to the new germs
and transforming the landscape wholesale. In many cases, however, the
Europeans also consciously obliterated biodiversity for their own
selfish economic ends. For example, consider the plantation system. The
immense diversity of the tropical and semi-tropical lands settled by the
Portuguese and Spanish, early implementers of the plantation economy,
was dramatically remade as land was turned over to grow a single crop
such as sugar. **[As territories were subjugated and incorporated into
European empires and the nascent capitalist system, indigenous
agricultural practices that were adapted to the local
climate]{.underline}** (and consequently highly diverse and resilient)
were extirpated. Such well-adapted agricultural practices were replaced
by cash crops grown for export to the imperial metropole. [Indigenous
peoples were displaced and slaves were imported to work the land,
generating a brutal system of hitherto unequalled exploitation based on
invented notions of racial difference**. In addition to displacing and
killing many millions of people, the monocultures of the plantation
economy quickly exhausted the land in the colonies, destroying soil
fertility, and increasing vulnerability to pests.**]{.underline} By the
late eighteenth century, plantation owners in the Caribbean islands had
begun to worry about environmental degradation and climate change, which
at the time was known as desiccation.61 As a result of the deforestation
linked to plantations, rain had ceased to fall on some of these islands.
Mounting concern over the deteriorating environment led to the passage
of the first conservation legislation, which set aside forest land in a
forerunner of national park systems.62 [As plantation owners depleted
the land, inter-imperial rivalry surged, with European colonial powers
vying to capture islands whose fertility had not yet been depleted.
**The British abolition of slavery in 1833 can, in fact, be seen as a
reaction to the declining productivity of its Caribbean plantations,
rather than as an act of selfless humanitarianism.**]{.underline}63
Despite mounting awareness of the destructive social and environmental
impact of the plantation system, however, the European powers continued
to establish plantations around the world, as extensive tea, rice, and
rubber industries were opened in Asia and Africa well into the twentieth
century. The Green Revolution of the second half of the twentieth
century continued this trend towards displacement of small peasant
agriculture by large landholdings devoted to export agriculture, with
fossil fuel based fertilizers and pesticides used to cope with the
resulting environmental stresses and contradictions.64 [As Europeans
colonized other parts of the world, they took cultural beliefs with them
that legitimated their conquests. **These ideologies of domination,
intended to justify European expropriation of indigenous people and
their land, also established an exploitative attitude towards flora and
fauna in the colonies.**]{.underline} The English philosopher John
**[Locke, for example, argued that God intended the land to belong to
those who were "industrious and rational."]{.underline}** These
attributes were manifested in Europeans' "improvement" of the land
through their labor, development work that, he argued, removed the land
from its original communal state and made it the property of the
Europeans. As Locke remarked, "He that in obedience to this command of
God, subdued, tilled and sowed any part of \[the land\], thereby annexed
to it something that was his property, which another had no title
to..."65 **[In other words, since indigenous people weren't using the
land properly, it didn't really belong to them and they could be
dispossessed with no problem.]{.underline}** Not coincidentally, Locke
owned plantations in English colonies in Ireland and Virginia.66 While
part of the "improvement" that Locke envisaged was to come through the
form of privatization known as enclosure, such development was also to
take place through the application of modern science. [As it was
conceptualized by Francis Bacon and his followers in the seventeenth
century, the scientific method involved interventions in a natural world
represented as a female body, a body that had to be "twisted on the
rack" and "tortured by fire" before it would reveal its
secrets.]{.underline} [But Bacon's representation of the forceful
subjugation of a feminized nature also reflects a process of subjugation
unfolding at the time he wrote: the violent acts of enclosure through
which women, accused of being witches and often burnt at the stake, were
deprived of control of their reproductive power in the early modern
period.]{.underline} 67 In many ways, Bacon and his acolytes were simply
expanding on the Judeo-Christian tradition; after all, it is Adam whom
God allows to name not just the animals in Genesis, thereby establishing
his dominion over the natural world, but also Eve. 68 **[Women being
burned at the stake in Europe, part of the campaign to enclose the
commons that helped inaugurate capitalism.]{.underline}** This
subjugation mirrored the equally savage measures through which the
European peasantry was expelled from the land they once held communally,
as well as the bottomless depravity of colonialism and racial slavery,
processes of expropriation, as Marx put it, "written in the annals of
mankind in letters of blood and fire." As Bacon's account of scientific
inquisition suggests, the scientific method took this reign of terror as
one of its core metaphors, generating a model of patriarchal mastery
over a passive feminized nature that set the terms for subsequent
notions of progress through domination of the natural world.
**[Doctrines of the objectivity and disinterestedness of the scientific
method helped to obscure the potentially ecocidal, patriarchal, and
racist character of techno-science, until the social movements of the
late twentieth century arose to challenge science's role in legitimating
colonialism, in depriving women of control of their bodies, and in
creating deadly chemicals such as DDT]{.underline}**.69

broadly advocated by the political economy of Adam Smith, John Maynard
Keynes and Friedrich Hayek have each been realized in the laissez-faire,
embedded-liberal and neoliberal periods of the interwar period, the
post-war period and the post-1979 period respectively.]{.underline}
Through a historical examination of the interwar collapse and the Great
Depression, the break-up of the Bretton Woods system and the 1970s
stagflation, and the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the Great Recession,
the chapter argues that [these understandings of capitalism and the
institutional arrangements they suggest fail to offer a convincing
account of crises in capitalism or a basis for stability]{.underline}.

[The implications of this analysis are extremely significant for
developing a rationale for an alternative (to) capitalism. This is
because if the institutional arrangements that logically flow from these
understandings of capitalist social relations have been realized, and
yet not served to create stability, these [crises -- in isolation --
represent an important contribution to a critique of]{.mark} those
particular understandings of [capitalism.]{.mark} However, [in
combination these crises suggest]{.mark} something more profound about
[capitalism]{.mark}: that it [is **intrinsically unstable and
crisis-prone**]{.mark}. The chapter therefore returns to Marx, who
believed that [capitalism is fundamentally contradictory because it
relies both on capitalists' need to lower wages to maintain profits in
the face of competition, and the need to reproduce living labour, on
which the creation of value and the accumulation of wealth
depend]{.mark}.]{.underline} Chapter 2 therefore argues [that [it is not
the form that capitalism takes]{.mark} -- the particular ways in which
people amass stocks of monetary wealth by pursuing profit -- [but
**capitalism itself which is at the root of
crises**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, the chapter argues that
[it is treating the accumulation of stocks of wealth through the pursuit
of profit as an important end in itself which is the source of
instability and crises in capitalism]{.underline}. The chapter therefore
establishes an empirical critique of the varying forms that capitalism
has taken, which contributes to a theoretical critique of capitalism
itself and provides a strong normative case for an alternative (to)
capitalism.

**Sell**, H., **2015**, Socialist Party of England and Wales, sister
party of Socialist Alternative, "IDENTITY POLITICS AND THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST OPPRESSION"
http://www.socialistalternative.org/2015/11/02/identity-politics-struggle-oppression/

[Over recent years there has been a growth in support for]{.underline}
what can broadly be described as ['identity politics' among]{.underline}
many mainly [young people who are]{.underline} rightly angry about and
[radicalised by, their experience of sexism, racism, homophobia,
prejudice against disabled people]{.underline} and other forms of
oppression. In one sense, identity politics is an inevitable part of the
political awakening of many members of oppressed groups within society.
Recognising that you are oppressed, and that you can fight against your
oppression through a common struggle with others who share the same
oppression, is a vital first step.¶ However, **[the history of struggle
against oppression shows that]{.underline}**, on the basis of
experience, **[those participating tend to go beyond identity politics
as they recognise [the root cause of]{.mark} their [oppression lies in
the structure of society.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The highest point of
the vast rebellion against racism in the US in the 1950s and 1960s, for
example, was reached by [[the Black Panthers]{.underline}]{.mark}, who
[[were founded]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1966 [[with the]{.mark}
magnificent [concept:]{.mark}]{.underline} "We do not fight racism with
racism. We fight racism with solidarity. We do not fight exploitative
capitalism with black capitalism. **[[We fight capitalism with basic
socialism]{.mark}".¶]{.underline}** Today, [both]{.underline} the
\#[[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter]{.underline} rebellion
[[and]{.mark} the [movement for]{.mark} \$[15]{.mark} Now [are the first
stages of a new mass uprising]{.mark}]{.underline} against poverty and
racism in the US. [However, the pushing back of consciousness globally
over the decades following the collapse of Stalinism in the late 1980s
and the capitalist triumphalism that accompanied it, mean that the **new
movements did not begin where the Panthers left off**, with a socialist
outlook.]{.underline} Nonetheless, there is a growing anti-capitalist
mood among young people in the US, which is a first step to drawing
socialist conclusions.¶ At the same time, [[identity politics is many
activists' **starting point**]{.mark}. While those involved in struggle
may see this mainly as a means to fight back, the form of identity
politics that has emanated from the universities and has dominated over
recent decades **[concentrates]{.mark} overwhelmingly [on discussing
personal experience]{.mark} of oppression [rather than]{.mark} trying to
find the [means to end it.¶ ]{.mark}**This includes]{.underline} all the
strands of identity politics that have become more prominent in recent
years, such as [intersectionality and privilege theory.]{.underline} [In
Britain these concepts remain little known in wider society]{.underline}
but have become commonplace in, for example, university feminist
societies. Intersectionalists argue that different oppressions
'intersect'. Indeed, they do: a black working-class woman is triply
oppressed, for example. But [**intersectionalists often [see their role
as]{.mark} cataloguing and [describing oppressions]{.mark} and their
intersections [rather than abolishing them]{.mark}.¶** Supporters of
'privilege theory' are best known for telling people to 'check their
privilege']{.underline} during (often online) debates. The founder of
privilege theory, Peggy [McIntosh]{.underline}, [argued that a white,
upper-class, heterosexual man]{.underline}, for example, [is carrying
around an 'invisible knapsack' full of unearned privileges.]{.underline}
The argument goes that power is not concentrated in the hands of one
class, or in the state, but is spread throughout society and therefore
exists in all social and interpersonal relationships. Privilege theory
states that every individual is part of a multiplicity of oppressive
relationships. It concentrates overwhelmingly on exhortations to
individuals to change, to check their privilege.¶ [But **[it is not
possible to eliminate either oppressions or privileges merely by
exhorting individuals to change their behaviour]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
In fact, in many countries there have been significant improvements in
social attitudes to different forms of oppression in recent decades, but
they have not resulted in the ending of the oppressions concerned.¶
Racism ingrained¶ [In Britain, for example,]{.underline} while racist
prejudices are still widespread, [crude racist ideas are far less
socially acceptable than]{.underline} they were [30 years ago. This has
come about for a number of reasons, above all]{.underline} the
determination and increased [confidence of black and Asian people to
fight discrimination]{.underline} and racism. [Another important factor
was]{.underline} the [widespread involvement of black and Asian workers
in]{.underline} the [trade unions]{.underline} in a common struggle
alongside white workers. Both of these factors helped to foster a strong
feeling among a large section of the white population, especially youth,
that racism is wrong and should be combated.¶ [Nonetheless, racism
remains deeply ingrained]{.underline} in British society. The police are
up to 28 times more likely to stop and search you if you are black or
Asian. The gap between average pay for white workers and those from
ethnic minorities has actually increased over recent years despite an
improvement in social attitudes. Over half of young black men are
unemployed, more than double the unemployment rate for young white men.¶
[In the US the situation is even starker.]{.underline} While deep-rooted
racism remains there has also been an improvement in social attitudes.
There has been the development of a black middle class and even a small
black elite. Both processes are reflected in the election of a black man
as US president. The vast majority of the black population, however,
remain among the poorest and most oppressed in society, facing violent
state repression. One hundred and thirty five African Americans were
killed by the police in the first half of 2015 alone.¶ [**[Racism does
not just stem from individual prejudices but]{.underline}**]{.mark} from
something more fundamental: **[[the nature of capitalism as it
has]{.mark} actually [developed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Malcolm X
correctly declared that, "you can't have capitalism without racism".
[Capitalism]{.underline}, as Karl Marx famously said, [came into being
"dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and
dirt".]{.underline} (Capital, Volume 1, Chapter 31) He was referring,
particularly, to the role of slavery in the accumulation of capital.
With slavery came the development of all kinds of pseudo-scientific
racist theories designed to justify the enslavement of African peoples.
Racist ideas were then adapted to justify the colonial oppression of
large parts of the world.¶ [[Capitalism was forced to abandon direct
colonial rule as a result of]{.mark} the magnificent [revolutionary
movements]{.mark} that took place against it. **[Economic
exploitation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, **[[is more brutal than
ever]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Two hundred and fifty years ago the gap
between the richest and poorest countries was around five to one. Today
it is 400 to one. [Racism is used to justify this vast gulf
and]{.underline} also [that black workers are usually among the poorest
and most oppressed sections of the working class even in the 'rich'
countries.¶]{.underline} Women's oppression¶ [Similarly, blatant sexism
is no longer acceptable in the way it would have been in the
past]{.underline}, particularly in the economically advanced capitalist
countries. Women have won greater rights in recent decades. There are
different factors that have led to this, including the development of
improved and widely available contraception. However, many of these
gains can be traced back to the growing confidence of women as a result
of many more women working rather than being isolated in the home.¶
**[Nonetheless, women continue to be oppressed.]{.underline}**
[This]{.underline} oppression [stems]{.underline}, [not]{.underline}
merely [from the attitudes of men]{.underline}, [but from the role of
women and the family in capitalist and earlier class
societies.]{.underline} Most of us think of 'the family' as the
individuals who make up our own family, who are often the people who are
closest to us. Historically, however, the family as an institution has
also acted within class societies as an agent of social control with the
father as 'head of the household' having responsibility for disciplining
women and children. While this concept has been weakened in the modern
era by the growing confidence of women, it is far from eliminated. The
idea remains deeply ingrained that women are possessions of men and that
we need to be loyal and obedient to our partners, and that violence and
coercion are acceptable means for men to achieve that, both towards
'their' women and 'their' children.¶ It is no longer socially acceptable
to openly state that women are the possessions of men, yet these ideas
were enshrined in law until relatively recently. Marital rape only
became illegal in Britain in 1991, Spain in 1992, and Germany in 1997.
While no longer legal or openly acceptable, marital rape is still
widespread and rarely punished. It is estimated that in Britain only 15%
of all rapes are reported to the police, and only 7% of those result in
conviction. According to the UN, of all the women killed globally in
2012 almost half were killed by their partners or family members. In
contrast, only 6% of killings with male victims were committed by
intimate partners or family members.¶ At the same time, women continue
to bear the brunt of domestic responsibilities despite increasingly also
going out to work. In many cases women are still, as the Russian
revolutionary Leon Trotsky put it, the 'slaves of slaves'. While in
Britain, for example, most studies show men accepting that they should
do an equal amount of domestic chores as women, there is still a
considerable gap between intentions and reality. One survey showed that
on average women did 17 hours a week of domestic chores (excluding
childcare) whereas men did less than six.¶ [It is true]{.underline},
therefore, [that men get some gain from women's disproportionate bearing
of the domestic burden]{.underline}, in having a few more hours leisure
time. **[The main gain, however, is for capitalism.]{.underline}** By
putting the main burden of domestic life, the bringing up of the next
generation (from which the future workforce is drawn), and caring for
the sick and elderly on women, they are removed from the responsibility
of society as a whole.¶ Power concentrated in the capitalist class¶ [To
suggest that power is not concentrated in one class is to completely
misunderstand the nature of capitalism.]{.underline} **[Today, wealth
and power is concentrated in fewer hands]{.underline}** -- the owners of
the major banks and corporations -- **[even than when Marx was
writing.]{.underline}** According to Oxfam, the richest 85 people on
earth -- a double-decker bus full -- have as much wealth as the poorest
half of the world's population. The richest 85 include five women and
one African, although white men predominate. Their role in society,
however, does not stem primarily from their colour or gender but that
they are part of a tiny super-wealthy ruling elite.¶ [**[The world's 100
biggest companies now control 70% of global trade.]{.underline}** [Even
if their boards of directors included]{.underline} ]{.mark}[many [more
black people]{.mark} or women [it would not make any material difference
to the exploitation suffered by the working class]{.mark} and poor
worldwide]{.underline}, **[[not least black
women]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Look at South Africa, where the
incorporation of a tiny minority of blacks into the capitalist class has
made no difference to the dire poverty suffered by the majority. And
capitalism is increasingly incapable of taking society forward. [**Many
of the [rights]{.mark}** partially **taken for granted by previous
generations in Europe**, [like a]{.mark} relatively [secure job, home
and pension, **are now things of the past.¶** ]{.mark}To say that
[**social relations**]{.mark} in modern society [are **capitalist
relations**]{.mark} is not to take an 'economic determinist' view of
society]{.underline}: arguing that every aspect of the 'superstructure'
of society -- the state, politics, culture, social attitudes and so on
-- are rigidly determined by the character of the economy. [On the
contrary, there is an inter-relationship between the two.]{.underline}
At the same time, [politics and social attitudes reflect not only the
current character of capitalism but also remnants of the past
and]{.underline} -- particularly in mass struggles of the working class
and the oppressed -- [the seeds of a potential better
future.]{.underline} Nonetheless, **[it is clear that [as long as we
live in a capitalist society]{.mark}]{.underline}**, where wealth and
power rests with the tiny elite who own and control industry, science
and technology, then **[[the superstructure of that society
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [**ultimately [reflect and act in the
interests of that]{.mark} [ruling elite.¶]{.mark}** [No amount of
demanding that people 'check their privilege' will eliminate social
attitudes generated and sustained by capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[While determined mass struggle can force capitalism to adapt to a
certain extent -- as]{.underline} has been the case [with LGBT rights,
equal pay legislation]{.underline} and other measures -- **[[permanent
and deep-rooted change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly where it
threatens the functioning of capitalism, [**[will only be achieved by
the socialist transformation of society.¶]{.mark}** The horrific
bureaucratic degeneration and]{.underline} then [collapse of the Soviet
Union have obscured the importance of the Russian
revolution]{.underline} in giving a glimpse of what socialism would mean
for those suffering oppression. In Russia in 1917 the working class led
a movement of the oppressed which successfully overthrew capitalism for
the first, and so far, the only time. Russia's extreme poverty and the
isolation of the new workers' state led to its degeneration.
Nonetheless, in the early days it gave a glimpse of how a new society
could overcome oppressions that had existed for millennia.¶ [In
'backward' Russia, legal changes were introduced very quickly which were
many decades ahead of any capitalist country.]{.underline} These
included [universal suffrage, civil marriage and divorce]{.underline}
when requested by either partner, [equal pay, paid maternity leave, the
right to abortion and the legalisation of homosexuality.]{.underline}
[Oppressed nationalities were given the genuine right to
self-determination.]{.underline} Measures were taken to encourage
nationalities and cultures oppressed under tsarism, including the
development of a written form of some languages for the first time.¶ Of
course, legal or formal measures do not in themselves end oppression.
Decades after the passing of equal pay legislation in Britain, for
example, women still earn an average of £5,000 a year less than men.
Addressing women's oppression in the Soviet Union, Trotsky described how
legal equality was a step forward but actual equality in social
relations required a far more "deep-going plough", capable of providing
real economic equality and lifting the domestic burden from women, and
transforming social attitudes ingrained over millennia. A whole number
of measures began to be introduced in the aftermath of the Russian
revolution (including free childcare, communal restaurants and public
laundries) which, while never fully implemented due to the degeneration
of the Soviet Union, gave a glimpse of how the domestic burden could be
lifted. That, in turn, could have laid the foundations for the building
of a society based on women's equality.¶ [Many intersectionalists put
very little emphasis on campaigning for economic and practical measures
to lift the burden on women]{.underline}, instead [concentrating
overwhelmingly on social attitudes, and trying to create
spaces]{.underline} within society [that are free of
oppression.]{.underline} Yet **[freeing women from the heavy load of
being the carers, cooks and cleaners for the whole of society is an
essential prerequisite for ending women's oppression.]{.underline}**
[Twenty-first century capitalism]{.underline}, far from taking steps
towards this, [is driving in the opposite direction.¶ Austerity affects
women severely.]{.underline} It includes huge cuts in public services
that partially lifted some of the responsibilities that fall on women.
David Cameron's big society could be summed up as demanding that women
compensate for the cuts to health, child and elderly care by taking the
burden on themselves. This is a demonstration that under capitalism,
even where oppressed groups make gains, they are never guaranteed to be
permanent. [This also applies to the devastating, sometimes
life-threatening, consequences of austerity for disabled
people.¶]{.underline} Combating prejudice¶ [Pointing out the need for
fundamental change in society does not]{.underline} in any way
[downgrade the importance of combating oppressive]{.underline} and
reactionary [ideas]{.underline} and practices while we live in this
society, including within the workers' movement. **[However, [this
will]{.mark} by necessity [be a constant battle.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[Intersectionalists call for 'safe spaces']{.underline} with zero
tolerance for anything considered an oppressive view. But it is utopian
to try and create a safe space which is sealed off from the society in
which we all live and are affected by[. [Turning inwards]{.underline}
]{.mark}[in order to concentrate on doing so -- [rather than turning out
to build a movement]{.mark} capable of winning real change -- [is
**doomed to** ]{.mark}**frustration and
[failure]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Far from creating safe spaces,
this can often lead to an undemocratic environment, where the
individuals dominant in a particular 'space' assert that they feel
oppressed by ideas and opinions they disagree with.¶ [[There
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a **dangerous tendency**]{.mark} to
suggest [that the **value of someone's contribution**]{.mark} to a
discussion [should be based]{.mark} **primarily [on what oppressions
they as an individual suffer from. This is completely
false]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Britain's first and only female prime
minister, [Margaret [Thatcher]{.mark}]{.underline}, [undoubtedly
[suffered]{.mark}]{.underline} individual oppression [[as a woman,
but]{.mark} the neo-liberal programme]{.underline} she drove through
[[was completely against the interests of working-class
women]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recently, Jeremy [Corbyn]{.underline}, the
new left leader of the Labour Party, [has been attacked]{.underline}
supposedly [for not having enough women in his shadow
cabinet]{.underline}, although his front bench is the first that has
been majority women. More women voted for Corbyn than for the other
right-wing candidates (two of whom were women) in the leadership
election because he stood against austerity. [Had he chosen a
pro-austerity woman]{.underline} as shadow chancellor rather than the
left MP, John McDonnell, [most]{.underline} of the women [who voted for
him would have]{.underline} correctly [been deeply
disappointed.]{.underline}¶ The issue of safe spaces also relates to
intersectionalists' views on gender: that the concept of two genders is
a social construct and, in reality, gender is more like a spectrum.
[Emphasis is often put on supporting transgender people]{.underline} and
all those who rebel against societal gender constraints. This includes
some who do not identify as either male or female but as
'gender-non-conforming'. [This reflects a positive rejection of current
gender relations]{.underline} and homophobia by a growing number of
young people. Socialists, of course, support the democratic right of
individuals to define both their own gender and sexuality. [However,
while there is radicalisation among an important layer on this issue,
that does not mean it is possible to create, as some intersectionalists
attempt, spaces within capitalist society completely free from societal
pressures regarding gender.¶ **[Cap]{.mark}italism [shapes the outlook
of all of us from the time we are born]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with all
of the distortions of the human personality that creates. [This includes
how we are expected to behave appropriately for our given
gender.]{.underline} It is not possible to fully escape this; in this
society capitalist gender roles are an objective reality. Even rejecting
capitalist gender norms means reacting to, and therefore being affected
by, those norms. It is not possible to prescribe exactly how human
relations, including the role of gender, would flower in the future when
freed from the rigid straitjackets imposed by capitalism.¶ The role of
the working class¶ **[[The crucial issue for anyone determined to end
oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, **[[is how to end
cap]{.mark}italism [and begin to build a world that is free of
oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}**: a 'safe space' for all. Today, just
as when Marx described [the working class]{.underline} as the 'grave
digger of capitalism', it [is the key force on the planet capable of
ridding us of this bankrupt system.]{.underline} [Both privilege theory
and [intersectionality would list social class]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}-- what they would describe as 'classism' -- [as **one form of
oppression**.]{.underline} However, [it features [as one item on a
list]{.mark} and is often discussed in terms of the prejudice people
face because of having a working-class accent or postcode.]{.underline}
**[[The centrality of class]{.mark} in the structure of society [is not
recognised. The basic idea that a Nigerian worker would have more in
common with a worker in Britain]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}or the
US [**[than]{.underline}** t]{.mark}hey would **[with [Aliko
Dangote]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the only African to make it on to the
list of the richest 85 on the planet, **[[would not be
understood]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The fact that it is the working class
that is ultimately responsible for the creation of the capitalists'
profits and that by collective action it is capable of bringing
capitalist society to a halt is discounted as outmoded.¶ Yet [the
working class is not 'disappearing'.]{.underline} In fact, [it is
potentially stronger today than it was at the time of the Russian
Revolution.]{.underline} Many countries where workers were a tiny
minority of society a century ago now have large and powerful working
classes. In the economically advanced countries, like Britain,
deindustrialisation has meant that the industrial working class is much
smaller. However, there still remain groups of workers with enormous
power to bring society a halt when they strike -- anyone who lives in
London and witnessed the recent London Underground strikes knows that.
Deindustrialisation has not led to young people becoming 'middle class',
but has forced them into low paid, temporary work, often in the service
sector. At the same time, large sections of the population -- including
teachers and civil servants -- who would have previously considered
themselves middle class have been driven down into the ranks of the
working class in their living conditions and social outlook.¶ [The
history of the 20th century repeatedly demonstrated the preparedness of
working-class people to fight for socialism.]{.underline} [However, it
also demonstrated that **[the capitalist class]{.mark}** does all it can
to cling to power, not least by **[attempt]{.mark}ing [to divide and
rule by turning different sections of the working class against each
other]{.mark}.¶** In recent years, there has been increasing
radicalisation and struggle globally, including revolutionary
movements.]{.underline} Out of these, largely unsuccessful, struggles
conclusions will begin to be drawn about **[what is
necessary]{.underline}** to change society. That **[requires a mass
revolutionary movement]{.underline}**, bringing together different
sections of the working class -- with different experiences and outlooks
-- **[in a mass party with a clear programme and a determined and
accountable leadership.¶]{.underline}** Such a party would not be a
model of a new society, but a tool to bring it about. Nonetheless, it is
crucial that such a mass party would include in its ranks all of the
most oppressed sections of the working class and that it is a vibrant
and democratic force in which all participants feel able to express
their views. Its programme, as was the case with the Bolsheviks in
Russia, has to fight for the rights not just of the working class in
general but also for different specifically oppressed groups.¶
Undoubtedly, such a movement would also win the support of wide sections
of the middle class and even individuals from the capitalist class who
saw the need for a break with capitalism. This would particularly
include those who suffer oppression under capitalism and who recognise
that the only way to end homophobia, racism or women's oppression is to
join the struggle for a new society.¶ Struggle itself unifies¶ [It would
be ludicrous and deplorable to argue that those fighting their
particular oppression should hold back and 'wait' for a unified
struggle]{.underline} of the whole working class. **[[Mass struggle is a
thousand times more effective than exhortations to individuals to change
their attitudes]{.mark} in winning social progress.]{.underline}** It is
always the case that [[a movement has]{.mark} a [greater chance of
success if it]{.mark} is able to [reach out to other sections of the
working class]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that therefore it is important
that the programme put forward by a particular movement attempts to do
this. However, that is in no way to suggest that any group should
artificially delaying fighting back until they, for example, convince
more white or male workers of their cause.¶ [Nonetheless, [to
permanently end racism in the US]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance,
[[will require ending capitalism and]{.mark} will]{.underline} therefore
[have to involve a struggle [uniting different sections of the working
class]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}-- black, Hispanic, Asian and white.
[This is a practical question.]{.underline} [The African American
population]{.underline}, who suffer the worst police racism, are 13% of
the population and [will not be able to win alone. The capitalist class
will try to increase divisions]{.underline} between different sections
of the oppressed, particularly at times of heightened struggle. The
oppressed need to increase their strength by trying to maximise unity.
The \$15 Now movement in the US, and the election of Socialist
Alternative member Kshama Sawant in Seattle, give a glimpse of the
growing possibilities in the US to build a united workers' movement.¶
Achieving unity does not mean downplaying the importance of combating
the specific oppressions different groups in society face. On the
contrary, it is vital that socialists campaign for the workers' movement
to fight to take up every aspect of oppression. The Socialist Party has
a proud history of doing this -- for example, spearheading the Campaign
Against Domestic Violence in the 1990s which was central to getting the
trade unions to take the issue up.¶ Intersectionality on university
campuses in Britain has had a tendency to turn campus feminist societies
inwards, focusing on a fruitless attempt to grade degrees of oppression
rather than fighting to end it. However, many of those initially
attracted to these ideas are searching for a way to change society and
will quickly come up against the limits of identity politics in all its
forms.¶ One small indication of this is the popularity among young
people of the film Pride, which tells the true story of Lesbians and
Gays Support the Miners (LGSM). LGSM recognised the common ground
between their struggle against the Tories and that of the 1984/85
miners' strike. Their attempt to support the miners was not without
difficulties -- with prejudices on both sides -- but ultimately forged a
real unity. LGSM understood that a victory for the miners would have
been a massive defeat for Thatcher, the Tories and the capitalist class
-- and that was in the interests of LGBT people. They never once
responded to white, straight miners, who were often initially
homophobic, by telling them to 'check their privilege'. One result of
their heroic efforts was big parts of the workers' movement
wholeheartedly taking up the struggle for LGBT liberation, including
National Union of Mineworkers lodges from across the country leading the
1985 Pride demonstration.¶ The miners' strike was a major event in the
class struggle in Britain, but it will be dwarfed by events that will
take place in the future against the background of a crisis-ridden
capitalism trying to drive the living standards of the majority into the
dirt. [For some intersectionalists it will require witnessing the power
of the working class in action in order for them to draw the conclusion
that the route to ending their specific oppression is not as part of
fragmented separate groupings but by throwing their lot in with the
class struggle. However, growing numbers of young people, particularly
when they become active in concrete struggles, are already being
attracted to socialist ideas as the only way to achieve real liberation
for all humanity.]{.underline}

### Explains/RC Terror

#### Capitalist dispossession of property is the root cause of the war on terror and the devaluation of poor populations across the globe 

**Boukalas 15** -- researcher in the Cardiff University School of Law
(Christos, "Class war-on-terror: counterterrorism, accumulation,
crisis," Critical Studies on Terrorism Vol 8 Issue 1, Taylor and
Francis,
<https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/17539153.2015.1005932>)

[We come therefore to understand the overall contour of counterterrorism
policy as the imposition of an effective ban on popular politics. The
latter can be expressed only inasmuch as it is granted permission or
tacit tolerance by the state.]{.underline} In effect, **[the state
imposes a monopoly over (legitimate) politics]{.underline}**, a
testament to the authoritarian hardening of its form. The political
exclusion of the population signifies that the state has become the
private affair of dominant capital. Here again, [counterterrorism policy
has been important in devising the structures through which public money
and, crucially, the capacity to make political decisions is taken over
by capital]{.underline}. [This arrangement takes place as **capitalism
enters a phase where the continuation of accumulation generates, and
depends on, crisis.**]{.underline} Throughout the neoliberal era, and
across both breadth and depth modes, [capital accumulation is enabled by
dispossession. This comprised, on the one hand, the integration of
previously non-market social assets and relations into the circuit of
capital: state-owned assets, health, education, land, water, art,
culture, genetic material, communal science, etc. -- all became
expropriated by private capital]{.underline}, marking a "greenfield"
expansion of accumulation (Harvey 2003 Harvey, D. 2003. The New
Imperialism. Oxford: OUP. \[Google Scholar\], 147--149). On the other
hand, on [the basis of supply-side economics that conceptualise the wage
as a cost of production rather than a source of demand]{.underline},
**[workfare is the fundamental strategy of the neoliberal
state]{.underline}**. [It entails material dispossession of the
population through sustained pressures on pensions and salaries,
reduction of social entitlements and rights to welfare, transportation,
education, and health, and the degradation of public
infrastructures]{.underline} (Jessop 2002 Jessop, B. 2002. The Future of
Capitalist State. Cambridge: Polity. \[Google Scholar\], 141--171,

From Safety Net to Trampoline." In The Rise and Fall of Neo-Liberalism,
edited by K. Birch and V. Mykhenko. London: Zed. \[Google Scholar\]).
[This marks an intensification of accumulation and results in the
extreme concentration of wealth, the diffusion of poverty]{.underline},
and the proliferation of highly exploitative and precarious labour
relations. This trend is further accentuated by tax and budgetary state
policy, which systematically fails to tax capital, and instead gathers
its income mainly from workers -- but then spends tax money not on
social welfare or education, but on handouts to capital and services
primarily beneficial to the rich (such as security, safeguarding of
intellectual property, or war). Thus, [the state budget has become a
mechanism that expropriates wealth from society and hands it over to
capital]{.underline} (Demirović 2009 Demirović, A. 2009.

Capitalist Mode of Production?" Development Dialogue, January 45--58.

Lane.\[Crossref\], , \[Google Scholar\], 71--74). Along these lines,
financialisation was generated by workfarism and material dispossession,
which made access to consumer goods, health and education dependent on
financial sector credit; and state policy forced pension and social
insurance funds to enter the financial market in order to survive. While
dependent on dispossession, [financialisation opened, at the same time,
new pastures of accumulation and became the primary source of capitalist
profitability until, in 2007, its crisis erupted]{.underline}

and Financial Expropriation." In Fianacialisation in Crisis, edited by
C. Lapavitsas. Chicago, IL: Haymarket. \[Google Scholar\]). It seems
therefore that [neoliberal capitalism is haunted by a fundamental
contradiction]{.underline}. The more successful its core strategy of
wealth concentration through devaluation of labour and life, the more
difficult capital accumulation becomes: as fewer and fewer people can
afford fewer and fewer commodities, the realisation of capital becomes
increasingly implausible and accumulation is reduced to mere amassment
of wealth (Harvey 2010 Harvey, D. 2010. The Enigma of Capital. London:

85--89). Accordingly, [the overall role of the capitalist state is to
manage the crisis while advancing the strategies that cause
it]{.underline}. It has managed to do so with exceptional ingenuity and
success for over a decade now, by postponing, ameliorating, and
dislocating crises and their effects -- for instance, the crisis of
2000--2001 was overcome by the throwing of public money at private
capital, while the continuing dispossession of the population was
countered by the mass provision of cheap credit; this led to the
2007--2011 crisis, which, in turn, was soon transformed from a
US-centred crisis of the financial sector to one of (especially
European) public sector debt. [The wave of violent **pauperisation of
populations across the core capitalist countries** that resulted from
the management of the public debt crisis led to a **new round of
accumulation through dispossession**: **the remaining state assets are
pilfered by capital**; **the last fortress of organised labour, the
public sector, is smashed**; the rate of exploitation intensifies; and
dominant capital (especially in finance) amasses record profits -- thus
laying the groundwork for the next crisis of capital
realisation]{.underline} (Crouch 2011 Crouch, C. 2011. The Strange

succession and the management of each accentuates the factors leading to
the next, there is no complete recovery between them. The subaltern
classes certainly do not return to pre-crisis levels and, wary of lack
of overall demand, capitalists are reluctant to invest (Demirović 2009

This makes bubbles the only path to recovery, turning capitalism into a
stop--start system (Kotz 2013 Kotz, D. 2013. "The Current Economic
Crisis in the US: A Crisis of Over-Investment." Paper presented at the

5. \[Google Scholar\], 5; Stiglitz 2012 Stiglitz, J. 2012. The Price of

85--89). The process of capital accumulation is recast as a circle of
crisis. While (usually orchestrated) crises are an ideal vehicle for
imposing upon societies the expropriation and dispossession vital for
accumulation (Klein 2007 Klein, N. 2007. The Shock Doctrine. London:
Allen Lane. \[Google Scholar\]), it also seems that crisis has also
become a method for accumulation (Bichler and Nitzan 2013 Bichler, S.,
and J. Nitzan. 2013. "Capitalism as a Mode of Power." In 22 Ideas to Fix

Kotz 2011 Kotz, D. 2011. "Neo-liberalism: The Rebound?" Actuel Marx,

has nothing to offer but crisis. Marketisation drastically undermines
the education system, material infrastructure and long-term-oriented
research, making very unlikely the prospects of a new economic
revolution (like the publicly funded, privately appropriated cybernetics
one) (Demirović 2009 Demirović, A. 2009. "Post-Neo-liberalism and

the capture of the state by capital precludes the advancement of
strategies for long-term social reproduction under capitalism; the
advent of neo-rentier capitalism (Harvey 2014 Harvey, D. 2014. Seventeen

dependent on state force; and, the recent financial crisis and its
transformation to one of public debt show a sudden thickening of
contradictions as the power of capital to exploit society reaches its
asymptotes (Harvey 2014 Harvey, D. 2014. Seventeen Contradictions and
the End of Capitalism. London: Profile. \[Google Scholar\], 235--245;
Bichler and Nitzan 2012 Bichler, S., and J. Nitzan. 2012. "The
Asymptotes of Power." Real-World Economics Review 60: 18--53. \[Google
Scholar\]). Given its persistence on the neoliberal route, economic
crisis seems to be a permanent condition and the only horizon of
capitalism. Yet, [economic crises are the health of capitalism: they
help it rearrange strategies, fine-tune practices, cannibalise capital,
advance technologies, rearrange alliances, proceed to new rounds of
dispossession, and so on]{.underline}. Economic crisis becomes dangerous
for capitalism only when it metastasises into a political one -- a
crisis of social and political practices, institutions, relations and
values. If, at present, capitalism can promise nothing but anxiety and
devastation, the question of what use it is for society may arise -- and
this must be prevented by all means. **[This is precisely what
counterterrorism helps to achieve]{.underline}**. On the one hand, [it
has been instrumental in setting up structures and modalities that
permit the constant reproduction of economic crisis, by enabling the
state to manage it through ad hoc, rapid and unrestrained Executive
action]{.underline}, determined at interpersonal forums by top Executive
personnel and top capital representatives, and sold to the population as
the only way to avoid impending doom; [on the other hand, **it enables
the state to fend off the mutation of an economic crisis to a political
one** -- through the stigmatisation of antagonistic politics, their
constant monitoring by the police, and their repression once they break
onto the public sphere. Counterterrorism is a main part of the
pre-emptive armoury of capitalism in the face of looming political
crisis]{.underline}.

#### The political ideology of capitalism inspires terrorist groups to challenge imperial states 

**Woods 17** Alan Woods (Alan Woods is a British Trotskyist political
theorist and author. He is one of the leading members of the
International Marxist Tendency (IMT) as well as of its British affiliate
group Socialist Appeal. He is political editor of the IMT\'s In Defense
of Marxism website), 06-07-2017, \"Terrorist madness and the sickness of
capitalism,\" In Defense of Marxism,
https://www.marxist.com/terrorist-madness-and-the-sickness-of-capitalism.htm

[The only force that can defeat terrorism and conduct a serious struggle
against imperialism and capitalism is the working class. Both the ruling
class and the terrorists seek to divide the working class, but most
workers understand that their only strength consists in their
unity.]{.underline} Socialism or barbarism When they look at the state
of the world we live in many people draw pessimistic conclusions. That
is hardly surprising. The world of the 21st century presents a picture
of almost unrelieved blackness: [everywhere there is pain, death,
destruction, endless wars and terrorism that has the aspect of an
uncontrollable epidemic.]{.underline} The productive forces stagnate or
decline. Living standards fall constantly for the majority, while a tiny
handful has at its disposal obscene wealth. Selfishness, greed and a
callous disregard for human suffering are elevated as the highest moral
principles. Society is sick, and nobody seems to offer any remedy for
the sickness. This evaluation is accurate but one-sided. [The pains that
we see are the pains of a socio-economic system that has long ago
outlived its historic usefulness, but refuses to abandon the scene.
Capitalism is sick unto death, but refuses to die. In its death agony,
it threatens to drag the whole of society down with it.]{.underline}
Centuries of human progress, art, science, culture and civilisation find
themselves threatened by a decadent and doomed socio-economic system.
However, this is only one side of the picture. Within the womb of the
old society, a new world is struggling to be born, a new world is
struggling to be born. Objectively speaking, all the conditions exist
for solving every one of the problems that face us. The human race holds
in its hands all the necessary technological and scientific means for
eradicating poverty, disease, unemployment, hunger, homelessness and all
the other evils that cause endless misery, wars and conflict. If this is
not done, it is not because it cannot be done, but because we have run
up against the limitations of an economic system based purely on profit.
The needs of humanity do not enter into the serious calculations of the
bankers and capitalists who rule the planet. This is the central
question, the answer to which will determine the future of the human
race. If we take the Middle East and North Africa, which constitutes a
large part of what is known as the Islamic world, we can say with
certainty that in the vast expanse that extends from the Euphrates to
the shores the Atlantic Ocean, all the conditions exist to create a
beautiful garden, far more splendid than the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
in the ancient world. [But decades of capitalist rule and imperialist
exploitation have turned what ought to be a beautiful garden into a
living hell for millions of people.]{.underline} Objectively speaking,
the huge quantities of mineral wealth under the soil, the vast areas of
potentially rich agricultural land, the rivers, the climate, and the
millions of able-bodied men and women who live there constitute a
colossal productive potential that could transform the lives of the
people. But this colossal potential has been wasted. Millions of young
people, many of them students with qualifications to be doctors,
teachers, engineers and agronomists are forced to eke out a miserable
existence, deprived of jobs, the future and any hope of improvement. [To
make things worse, the constant interference and military interventions
by imperialist powers have devastated Iraq, Syria and Libya and reduced
their populations to a state bordering on barbarism. Anyone who seeks
the objective causes of terrorism need look no further. The terrorist
barbarism is only a reflection of the barbarous conditions to which
millions of people have been reduced. And this barbarism is now knocking
on the doors of Europe, threatening the lives and security of its
people. It is a serious problem and it requires a serious solution. The
idea that one can "fight terror" with the weapons of terror itself is a
delusion.]{.underline} It is like a doctor who attempts to cure a
disease by cutting out the superficial symptoms with a knife. This
method is not only painful but useless. It will never cure the disease
but cause a permanent disfigurement to the patient. The Spanish
Socialist Largo Caballero said long ago: you cannot cure cancer with an
aspirin. Drastic problems demand drastic solutions. What is required is
a root and branch solution. [The problem is capitalism
itself.]{.underline} The rule of the banks and big monopolies must be
brought to an end. The control of society must be placed firmly in the
hands of the only class that creates all its wealth, and the only class
that truly cares about the future of humanity: the working class. A
socialist planned economy, which is dedicated to the satisfaction of
human needs, not the profits of a pampered few, will mobilise the vast
resources of our planet for the benefit of the human race. We can create
a paradise in this world that will render unnecessary all dreams of a
paradise beyond the grave. That is the only hope for humanity and the
only cause worth fighting for.

#### Capitalism causes nuclear proliferation

**Nisbet 2018** - Media Representative of Hizb ut Tahrir in Britain,
(Yahya, "The World Will Never Be Safe from Nuclear Weapons under
Capitalist Hegemony", Hizb ut-Tahrir Britain, 11/1/18,
http://www.khilafah.com/the-world-will-never-be-safe-from-nuclear-weapons-under-capitalist-hegemony/)//ar.

With recent news that US President Donald Trump has been bragging about
how large his nuclear button is, and that the US is about to publish its
nuclear posture review, [the whole world is reminded of just how
dangerous the capitalist world leadership is for humanity. The US plans
to loosen constraints on the use of nuclear weapons and is preparing new
types of lower yield nuclear weapons, which it claims will be "more
usable" in future conflicts.]{.underline} It has been suggested that
there is a presumed reluctance for the Americans to use the massively
destructive weapons already in its arsenal, while smaller nukes may be
more readily deployed. [It is a myth that belies reality that the
capitalist West has any qualms about killing millions of people to
secure the interests of its own elite. It claims to only act in defence
but actually instigates numerous conflicts throughout the world; in
order to find an excuse to intervene.]{.underline} It claims to hold
international law sacrosanct but manipulate its provisions according to
their own wishes and are the first to contravene it when it suits them
to do so. [The capitalist West only claims to stand for human rights but
will think nothing of taking the world to the brink of thermonuclear war
in support of its own interests. Even the nuclear non-proliferation
treaties that the Western nations promoted were not about limiting the
use of such weapons, but were only to ensure that they would remain the
dominant power brokers in the world.]{.underline} America is the nation
that destroyed the men, women and children of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
with nuclear weapons. Britain carpet-bombed Dresden in Germany; killing
every living soul within. During the 1950's Korean War, America used
similar destructive force to utterly destroy Pyongyang, the northern
capital. Millions were left to starve to death in India's 1943 Bengal
famine, when Churchill deliberately denied famine relief for the region.
Under British colonialism millions of civilians were attacked, tortured
or killed, or left to die, as their humanity meant nothing to the
ruthless pursuit of wealth by the British elite. [More recently the
world has been horrified at the cruelness of the West's indifference to
the genocide and massacres in Burma, Syria and Bosnia, in Palestine,
Iraq and Yemen, and their arming of and support for the regimes that
have carried out such crimes.]{.underline} As saddening as it is to read
about such inhumanity, it is not at all unexpected of a leadership that
carries the secular capitalist ideology. The flawed secular belief leads
to a system of balancing freedoms and rights, which are frequently
undermined by financial interests, allowing human life to be devalued,
whenever it is expedient to do so. [Capitalist hegemony never has and
never will be in the interests of all humankind, as it only serves the
powerful elite, which exploits everyone else for their own material
gain.]{.underline} Since the introduction of nuclear weapons of mass
destruction in the hands of such irresponsible and callous people who
will again rush to shed rivers of blood with their weapons, as they
already have, the need for a responsible just world-order became
increasingly urgent. The world will not feel safe and secure unless
capitalism and other man-made systems cease to control the world, and
the system of truth and justice, the righteous Caliphate, \[Khilafah
Rashidah\] the system of the Lord of the Worlds, dominates this world
and spreads the good and the joy of living, and tranquillity. [Whilst
the Caliphate will need to possess nuclear weapons as long as the
irresponsible hostile nations possess them: it will be a responsible
state for all humankind. It will lead the call for genuine global
nuclear disarmament that is verifiable in order to end this threat to
the welfare of humanity.]{.underline} The Creator is the One who knows
what works best for His creatures.

### Explains/RC Middle East

#### US imperialism is the root cause of conflict in the Middle East

**Swerdlow, 17** -- Swerdlow researches Islamic and Peace studies at
Oberlin College(Leora, "American Imperialism in Iraq and Iran",
<https://languages.oberlin.edu/relg270/leora-swerdlow-american-imperialism-in-iraq-and-iran/>
7/20/19,) JX.

**"T**he United States has long been a force of global imperialism,
guising both overt and covert acts of violence, cultural eradication,
and territorial destruction under the umbrella of "democratization." [In
the name of promoting human rights, liberty, and American
exceptionalism, the U.S. has waged dozens of wars, backed numerous
dictators, and poured exorbitant amounts of money into its Department of
Defense.]{.underline} Between 1948 and 1970, the United States
intervened on an average of once every 14 months in a third world
country against a government or movement of which it did not approve --
from Guatemala to Lebanon to Indonesia\[1\]. [In the Middle East, one of
the most visible manifestation of American imperialism in recent decades
is the Iran-Iraq War.]{.underline} Iraq's invasion of Iran in September
of 1980 was preceded by mounting tensions in the region between the two
countries, exacerbated by the Iranian Revolution of 1978. [Due to both
Iran's Islamic Revolution and the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 , the
Reagan Administration began to view Iran as a great threat and enemy of
the U.S.,]{.underline} [leading consequently to U.S. support of Baathist
Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war\[2\].]{.underline} Ultimately, United
States interventionism in the Iran-Iraq war led to massive destruction
in the region, hostility between Iran and the US, and to the emergence
of radical Islamic terrorist groups such as ISIS.

The Iranian Revolution of 1979 was viewed as a threat to United States
imperialism because of its establishment of a religious theocracy and
the removal of the pro-American Shah from power. The US had provided
military aid to the Shah, whose regime had brutalized the Iranian people
for 26 years. Under the Shah, Western oil workers entered Iran and the
country's capital, Tehran, became a center for high-paid foreign oil
workers to engage openly in un-Islamic activities including alcohol
consumption, casino gambling and prostitution. Not only that, but the US
had trained and equipped his secret police, built his armies and sold
\$19 billion worth of weapons to his regime\[3\]. While the country's
oil wealth was flowing into the pockets of foreigners and the Shah and
his companions, most Iranians were struggling to survive in poverty.
Eqbal Ahmad describes this relationship as, "a culture of
corruption\[4\]." The fact that the overthrow of the Shah was entirely
unpredicted by the US government further contributed to United States
trepidation, anti-Iranian rhetoric, and eventual military excursions in
the region. However for the Iranian people, the revolutionary rhetoric
was not new. The revolution in '79 was the seventh or eighth time in 100
years that a battle had been fought between the Iranian national
movement and the Iranian monarchy, with foreign governments and
corporations on their side\[5\].

### Explains/RC US China Conflict 

#### Capitalism ensures tensions between the US and China

**Roubini 2019** -- He is professor of economics at New York
University\'s Stern School of Business and is the co-founder of RGE
Monitor, an innovative economic and geo-strategic information service.
He served as a senior adviser to the White House council of economic
advisers and the US Treasury, and has published numerous policy papers
and books on key international macroeconomic issues. He is a member of
the Council for the Future of Europe. His articles are brought to
readers in co-operation with Project Syndicate. (Nouriel, "Could the
US-China trade row become a global cold war?", The Guardian, 5/20/19,
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/20/us-china-trade-war-donald-trump-xi-jinping)//ar.

[The US blames China for the current tensions. Since joining the World
Trade Organization in 2001, China has reaped the benefits of the global
trading and investment system, while failing to meet its obligations and
free riding on its rules. According to the US, China has gained an
unfair advantage through intellectual property theft, forced technology
transfers, subsidies for domestic firms and other instruments of state
capitalism. At the same time, its government is becoming increasingly
authoritarian, transforming China into an Orwellian surveillance state.
For their part, the Chinese suspect that the US's real goal is to
prevent them from rising any further or projecting legitimate power and
influence abroad. In their view, it is only reasonable that the world's
second-largest economy (by GDP) would seek to expand its presence on the
world stage. And leaders would argue that their regime has improved the
material welfare of 1.4 billion Chinese far more than the west's
gridlocked political systems ever could. Regardless of which side has
the stronger argument, the escalation of economic, trade, technological,
and geopolitical tensions may have been inevitable. What started as a
trade war now threatens to escalate into a permanent state of mutual
animosity. This is reflected in the Trump administration's national
security strategy, which deems China a strategic "competitor" that
should be contained on all fronts.]{.underline} Accordingly, the US is
sharply restricting Chinese foreign direct investment in sensitive
sectors, and pursuing other actions to ensure western dominance in
strategic industries such as artificial intelligence and 5G. It is
pressuring partners and allies not to participate in the Belt and Road
Initiative, China's massive programme to build infrastructure projects
across the Eurasian landmass. And it is increasing US Navy patrols in
the East and South China Seas, where China has grown more aggressive in
asserting its dubious territorial claims. [The global consequences of a
Sino-American cold war would be even more severe than those of the Cold
War between the US and the Soviet Union. Whereas the Soviet Union was a
declining power with a failing economic model, China will soon become
the world's largest economy, and will continue to grow from there.
Moreover, the US and the Soviet Union traded very little with each
other, whereas China is fully integrated in the global trading and
investment system, and deeply intertwined with the US, in particular. A
full-scale cold war thus could trigger a new stage of deglobalisation,
or at least a division of the global economy into two incompatible
economic blocs. In either scenario, trade in goods, services, capital,
labour, technology and data would be severely restricted, and the
digital realm would become a "splinternet," wherein western and Chinese
nodes would not connect to one another.]{.underline} Now that the US has
imposed sanctions on ZTE and Huawei, China will be scrambling to ensure
that its tech giants can source essential inputs domestically, or at
least from friendly trade partners that are not dependent on the US.

### Explains/RC US Russia Conflict 

#### Capitalism causes strenuous relations between Russia and the US which will lead to a new Cold War

**Graham 2019** - Ambassador Thomas Graham Jr. is a former senior U.S.
diplomat. Graham was involved in the negotiation of every single
international arms control and non-proliferation agreement from 1970 to
1997. (Thomas, "U.S.-Russian Relations in a New Era", The National
Interest, 1/6/19,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/us-russian-relations-new-era-40637)//ar.

[The post--Cold War period in U.S.-Russian relations ended abruptly in
March 2014 with the eruption of the Ukraine crisis. The United States
finally abandoned the waning aspiration to slowly integrate Russia into
the Euro-Atlantic community that had driven its Russia policy since the
end of the Cold War. Russia demonstrated its willingness to flout the
norms that had governed European security since the signing of the
Helsinki Accords in 1975 to protect its vital national interests. Talk
of partnership vanished; channels of communication were severed. Each
country now clearly viewed the other as a strategic
competitor.]{.underline} That point was made explicit in the U.S.
National Security Strategy released in December 2017. Russian President
Vladimir Putin had repeatedly made it with increasing vehemence since
his remarks at the Munich Security Conference in February 2007. This
does not mean, as many commentators argue, that a new cold war has
broken out, even if [relations are at their lowest ebb since the early
1980s, one of the darkest periods of the original Cold War. The
international context and the nature of relations are radically
different. The distribution of power in the world is no longer bipolar
as it was during the Cold War. Rather, the contours of an inchoate
multipolar system are emerging. The two countries are no longer engaged
in a global existential struggle of two diametrically opposed
philosophies of man and the state. Rather, both countries oversee
variations of a capitalist economic system and profess adherence to
democracy. U.S.-Russian relations no longer structure the international
system or dominate the global agenda. Rather, they are among many other
bilateral and multilateral relationships that shape the system and
agenda, and not necessarily the most consequential. And Russia no longer
lies at the center of American foreign policy, even if the United States
remains a top priority for Russia. Rather, the United States is focused
on other matters, including China and international terrorism. The new
National Security Strategy does not change the picture, even if it
identifies Russia as a revisionist power and strategic competitor, for
the strategy also identifies China in the same terms and names Iran,
North Korea, and international terrorism as major threats. As in the
Cold War, however, relations will remain troubled for a considerable
period, defined more by competition, at times verging on outright
confrontation, than cooperation. In the near term, there can be no
return to the hope for partnership of the immediate post--Cold War
years, no new reset, and no rapid improvement in relations even if the
intensity of estrangement might abate. The differences---over the
principles of world order, the essence of regional conflicts, and the
fundamental values that should inform political affairs---are too
profound for it to be otherwise. How long this period of strategic
competition will last is an open question, as is the evolution of
U.S.-Russian relations to mid-century. Much will depend on domestic
developments and global trends. The future could bring
indifference---because one or the other country ceases to figure large
in world affairs---or, if both countries continue to matter, permanent
confrontation, strategic competition, or strategic cooperation with
far-reaching global implications.]{.underline} The Burden of History
That U.S.-Russian relations are competitive should not come as a
surprise. That has been their prevailing character since the United
States emerged as a global power at the end of the nineteenth century.
Then, the United States and the Russian Empire, along with Japan, were
competing for influence in Manchuria. In 1904, in the early phases of
the Russo-Japanese War, the United States in Realpolitikk fashion tilted
toward what it thought was the weaker power, Japan. It shifted position
only after Japan humiliated Russia on both land and sea, mediating a
peace to create a favorable balance of power in Northeast Asia. After
the First World War, the United States refused to recognize the new
Bolshevik regime because of its subversive, anti-capitalist foreign
policy, relenting only in 1933, as the Nazi storm clouds were gathering
over Europe and Japanese imperialism began to threaten U.S. interests in
East Asia and the Pacific. After the Second World War, the United States
and the Soviet Union engaged in a bitter cold war, which brought them to
the cusp of thermonuclear conflict during the Cuban Missile Crisis of
1962. [Even the rare times of cooperation were less compelling than
might appear at first glance. The victorious alliance against Nazi
Germany, for example, was laced with deep suspicion. Russia and the
United States fought not so much in common as in parallel on the eastern
and western fronts, respectively. The postwar settlement divided Europe
into two opposing camps that quickly found themselves in the grips of a
cold war. More recently, the cooperation in the first post--Soviet
decade was grounded less in common strategic interests than a weak
Russia's timid acquiescence in U.S. actions it found objectionable, such
as the U.S. intervention in the Balkan wars and NATO expansion. Any
pretense of cooperation began to wither away as Russia regained its
strength under Putin in the 2000s, to be ultimately replaced by the
present profound estrangement.]{.underline}

First, in November 1978, [China's leaders]{.underline}, led by Deng
Xiaoping, [adopted a policy of reform and opening up: liberalizing the
economy and becoming more integrated with the global
economy.]{.underline} Reform and opening up was designed to repair the
disaster that Mao Zedong had inflicted on China during his rule and
bring a better life for the Chinese people. By the way, [one of the
places that Deng hoped would contribute to China's economic growth was
Taiwan.]{.underline} Second, in December 1978, [President Jimmy Carter
and Chinese leader Hua Guofeng announced that the United States and
China would establish diplomatic relations on January 1, 1979. As part
of that agreement, President Carter said that Washington would conduct
relations with Taiwan on an unofficial basis and end the mutual defense
treaty with the island.]{.underline} Third, on January 1, 1979, [the
leaders of China's legislature sent a message to Taiwan people calling
for an end to the hostile relations between the People's Republic of
China on the Mainland and the Republic of China on Taiwan, and for
movement to the ultimate unification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline} And fourth, on April 10, 1979, P[resident Carter
signed the Taiwan Relations Act, which Congress had passed to create the
American Institute in Taiwan, a nominally private organization that
would conduct substantive relations with Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations
Act also provided assurances to the island's leaders about U.S. support
for its security.]{.underline} Note that these four events are related.
If reform and opening up was to stimulate China's economic growth, China
needed a normal relationship with the United States, with better access
to American markets, capital, technology, management know-how, and
universities. [The United States wanted a normal relationship with China
for both economic and strategic reasons. But the People's Republic of
China government in Beijing insisted that when it came to diplomatic and
other relations with the two Chinas, Washington had to choose between it
and the government on Taiwan, its rival. President Carter chose the
People's Republic of China.]{.underline} China believed that once the
United States abandoned Taiwan in this way, the leaders of the ruling
Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) would feel so weak that they would
give in to Beijing's demand for unification on the PRC's terms. [Beijing
was unhappy at that time that the United States would continue to sell
arms to Taiwan, and remains unhappy to this day. China also believed
that China's reforming economy would be an attractive trade and
investment site for Taiwan's companies, which could have favorable
political consequences.]{.underline}

### [Explains/RC Everything]{.underline}

#### Capitalism is the root cause of every impact -- climate change, war, structural inequality, and psychological violence

**Robinson PhD '18** (William, American professor of sociology at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, "Accumulation Crisis and Global
Police State")/ly

Each major episode of crisis in the world capitalist system has
presented the potential for systemic change. Each has involved the
breakdown of state legitimacy, escalating class and social struggles,
and military conflicts, leading to a restructuring of the system,
including new institutional arrangements, class relations, and
accumulation activities that eventually result in a restabilization of
the system and renewed capitalist expansion. The current crisis shares
aspects of earlier system-wide structural crises, such as of the 1880s,
the 1930s or the 1970s. But there are six interrelated dimensions to the
current crisis that I believe sets it apart from these earlier ones and
suggests that a simple restructuring of the system will not lead to its
restabilization -- that is, [our very survival]{.underline} now
[requires a **revolution against global capitalism**]{.underline}
(Robinson, 2014). These six dimensions, in broad strokes, present a "big
picture" context in which a global police state is emerging. First, [the
system is fast **reaching the ecological limits** of its
reproduction]{.underline}. [We have]{.underline} already [passed tipping
points in climate change]{.underline}, the nitrogen cycle, and diversity
loss. For the first time ever, [human conduct]{.underline} is
intersecting with and fundamentally altering the earth system in such a
way that [threatens to bring about a **sixth mass
extinction**]{.underline} (see, e.g., Foster et al., 2011; Moore, 2015).
These ecological dimensions of global crisis have been brought to the
forefront of the global agenda by the worldwide environmental justice
movement. Communities around the world have come under escalating
repression as they face off against transnational corporate plunder of
their environment. While capitalism cannot be held solely responsible
for the ecological crisis, [it is **difficult to** imagine that the
environmental catastrophe can be **resolved** within the capitalist
system]{.underline} [given capital's implacable **impulse to
accumulate**]{.underline} [and its accelerated **commodification of
nature**]{.underline}. Second, [the level of global social polarization
and **inequality** is **unprecedented.**]{.underline} The richest one
percent of humanity in 2016 controlled over half of the world's wealth
and 20 percent controlled 95 percent of that wealth, while the remaining
80 percent had to make do with just five percent (Oxfam, 2017). These
[escalating inequalities fuel]{.underline} capitalism's chronic problem
of [overaccumulation:]{.underline} the TCC cannot find productive
outlets to unload the enormous amounts of surplus it has accumulated,
[leading to chronic stagnation in the world economy]{.underline} (see
next section). Such extreme levels of social polarization present a
challenge of social control to dominant groups. As Trumpism in the
United States as well as the rise of far-right and neo-fascist movements
in Europe so well illustrate, [cooptation]{.underline} also
[involves]{.underline} the manipulation of [fear and insecurity among
the downwardly mobile]{.underline} [so that **social anxiety** is
channeled towards **scapegoated communities**.]{.underline} [This
**psychosocial mechanism** of displacing mass anxieties is]{.underline}
not new, but it [appears to be increasing]{.underline} around the world
[in the face of the structural destabilization of capitalist
globalization.]{.underline} [Extreme inequality requires extreme
violence and repression]{.underline} that lend themselves to projects of
21st century fascism. Third, [the sheer magnitude of the means of
violence and social control is unprecedented]{.underline}, as well as
the magnitude and concentrated control over the means of global
communication and the production and circulation of symbols, images, and
knowledge. [Computerized wars, drone warfare, robot soldiers,
bunker-buster bombs, a new generation of nuclear weapons, satellite
surveillance, cyberwar, spatial control technology,]{.underline} and so
forth, [have **changed the face of warfare**]{.underline}, and more
generally, of systems of social control and repression. We have arrived
at the panoptical surveillance society, a point brought home by Edward
Snowden's revelations in 2013, and the age of thought control by those
who control global flows of communication and symbolic production. [If
global capitalist crisis leads to a new world war the destruction would
simply be unprecedented]{.underline}. Fourth, [we are reaching
limits]{.underline} to the extensive expansion of capitalism, in the
sense that [there are no longer any new territories of significance to
integrate]{.underline} into world capitalism [and new spaces to
commodify are drying up]{.underline}. [The capitalist system is by its
nature **expansionary.**]{.underline} In each earlier structural crisis,
the system went through a new round of extensive expansion -- from waves
of colonial conquest in earlier centuries, to the integration in the
late 20th and early 21st centuries of the former socialist countries,
China, India and other areas that had been marginally outside the
system. There are no longer any new territories to integrate into world
capitalism. At the same time, the privatization of education, health,
utilities, basic services, and public lands is turning those spaces in
global society that were outside of capital's control into "spaces of
capital," so that intensive expansion is reaching depths never before
seen. What is there left to commodify? Where can the system now expand?
[New spaces have to be violently cracked open and the peoples in these
spaces must be repressed]{.underline} by the global police state. Fifth,
[there is the rise of]{.underline} a vast surplus population inhabiting
[a "planet of slums]{.underline}" (Davis, 2007) [pushed out of the
productive economy, **thrown into the margins,**]{.underline} and
subject to sophisticated systems of social control and to destruction,
[into a mortal cycle of **dispossession-exploitation
exclusion**.]{.underline} Crises provide capital with the opportunity to
accelerate the process of forcing greater productivity out of fewer
workers. The processes by which surplus labor is generated have
accelerated under globalization. Spatial reorganization has helped
transnational capital to break the territorial-bound power of organized
labor and impose new capital--labor relations based on fragmentation,
flexibilization, and the cheapening of labor. These developments,
combined with a massive new round of primitive accumulation and
displacement of hundreds of millions, have given rise to a new global
army of superfluous labor that goes well beyond the traditional reserve
army of labor that Marx discussed. [Global capitalism]{.underline} has
no direct use for surplus humanity. But indirectly, it [holds wages
down]{.underline} everywhere and makes new systems of 21st century
slavery possible.1 [Dominant groups face the challenge of how to
contain]{.underline} both [the real and potential rebellion of surplus
humanity]{.underline}. In addition, [surplus humanity cannot
consume]{.underline} [and]{.underline} so as their ranks expand the
problem of [overaccumulation becomes exacerbated]{.underline}. Sixth,
there is an acute political contradiction in global capitalism: economic
globalization takes places within a nation-state system of political
authority. Transnational state apparatuses are incipient and have not
been able to substitute for a leading nation-state with enough power and
authority to organize and stabilize the system, much less to impose
regulations on transnational capital. [In the age of capitalist
globalization]{.underline} [governments must attract]{.underline} to the
national territory [transnational corporate investment]{.underline},
[which requires]{.underline} providing capital with all the incentives
associated with neoliberalism -- [downward pressure on
wages]{.underline}, [deregulation,]{.underline} austerity, and so on --
[that **aggravate inequality, impoverishment, and
insecurity**]{.underline} for working classes. Nation-states face a
contradiction between the need to promote transnational capital
accumulation in their territories and their need to achieve political
legitimacy. [As a result, states]{.underline} around the world [have
been experiencing spiraling **crises of legitimacy**]{.underline}. This
situation generates bewildering and seemingly contradictory politics and
also helps explain the resurgence of far-right and neo-fascist forces
that espouse rhetoric of nationalism and protectionism even as they
promote neo-liberalism.

#### Neoliberal policies are the root cause of violence, oppression, warming, and instability-- the price to pay is too high

**Greenberg,** Ph.D in Anthropology at University of Michigan, **2012**

(James B., Thomas Weaver (Ph.D. in Anthropology at University of
California at Berkeley), Anne Browning-Aiken (Ph.D. in Anthropology at
University of Arizona), William L. Alexander (Professor of Anthropology
at University of Arizona), "The Neoliberal Transformation of Mexico,"
*Neoliberalism and Commodity Production in Mexico,* University Press of
Colorado, pp 334-335)

[Neoliberalism also underlies the growing problems of crime and violence
affecting Mexico more broadly]{.underline}. The policies that ruined
smallholder agriculture also made the country receptive to growing
marijuana and poppies, thereby open- ing spaces into which drug cartels
moved (see the chapter by Emanuel and chapter 9 by Weaver, this volume).
The money from the drug trade has had a pernicious effect on Mexican
society, creating extensive problems of corruption and increas- ing
levels of violence (Campbell 2009). [Neoliberal policies have driven
millions of Mexicans into economic exile and helped turn Mexico into a
major source of drugs.]{.underline} Both drugs and victims of structural
violence spill across the border, as does the violence that too often
accompanies them, reminding us that we live in a global society and
that[neoliberalism in Mexico also has direct consequences for the United
States.]{.underline}As we have seen with the near collapse of global
financial mar- kets, [problems are contagious in an increasingly
integrated global economy. Just as the consequences of neoliberal
policies in Mexico spill over into the United States, the impacts of US
applications of neoliberalism reverberate in Mexico]{.underline}. As the
popular saying goes, "When the United States catches a cold, Mexico
catches pneumonia." Tight credit affects commodity chains, so the
consequences of the neoliberal debacle in US financial markets are felt
strongly in Mexico. In sum, our major area of unease regarding
neoliberalism is that, as an eco- nomic framework, the lopsided version
of development it delivers comes at too high a price.[While
neoliberalism may further global capitalism's frantic drive for
expansion and increased profit, it has not resolved intra- and
inter-nation prob- lems of inequality, environmental degradation,
unequal distribution of resources and gains, global warming, lack of
healthcare, instability of pension funds, cor- ruption, and clientelism.
Instead, it has increased violence and oppression and generally worsened
working and living conditions]{.underline}.

### Explains/RC Heg

#### The process of neoliberal globalization allows hegemons to control the international order 

**Ahmed, 13** - investigative journalist, author, academic and change
strategist. He is editor of the crowdfunded investigative journalism
platform INSURGE intelligence. He is a former environment blogger for
The Guardian from March 2013 to July 2014. (Nafeez, "Structural Violence
as a Form of Genocide The Impact of the International Economic Order"
Academia. November 6, 2016)//MG

Globalization: A Case of Structural Genocide? Malthusian explanations of
the 19th cen­ tury famines ascribed them not only to weather conditions,
but also to the factors of "too many people, too little land, too little
food." This sort of explanation of mass hunger and deprivation in the
'Third World' as an inevitable consequence solely of con­ straints of
nature prevails today in much conventional globalization discourse
(Ross, 1998). British market­oriented economic policies closely resemble
the contemporary policies being enthusiastically promoted and imposed by
Western governments and international financial institutions as a
corollary of the globalization process (Murshed, 2003). As Davis (2000)
thus comments, a revised understanding of the connection between 19th
century imperial economics and the phenomenon of artificial famines in
India, China and elsewhere, "throws light on the origins of many of the
current chal­ lenges of so­called 'development': it also calls into
question the wisdom of develop­ ment policies that are still pursued
today and the justifications given for them." Agential Intention In his
attempt to link structure and agency in understanding the operation of
the international economic order, Robert Cox (1987: 29, 7) emphasizes
the mediat­ ing influence of institutions functioning within the
framework of a "world order" centred on a single hegemonic power (the
United States). These powerful inter­governmental agencies and
institutions actively reproduce the structure of global trade,
production and finance regimes. **[These in turn]{.underline}** are
responsible for increasingly transnation­ al class structures that
effectively **[set the 'rules of the game' in ways that systematic­ ally
create patterns of advantage and disad­ vantage in the world
economy]{.underline}** (Beeson and Bell, 2003: 18). **[Countries that
industrialized early]{.underline}**, thus establishing a dominant
position in the global hierarchy of political and economic power,
thereby **[benefit from structurally entrenched advantages reinforced by
a power­ ful transnational regulatory framework]{.underline}** (p. 22).
Thus, as Cox (1987: 359) observes, a "transnational managerial class"
attempting to construct world order in a manner that conforms to its
perceived interests operates through international institutions such as
the World Bank and the International Mon­ etary Fund (IMF). The function
of agential intention here is at first glance problematic. Hay, for ex­
ample, notes that due to the inability of strategic actors to foresee
all possible con­ sequences of an act, "there is a whole host of actors
capable of contributing uninten­ tionally to a series of global
processes, tendencies and counter­tendencies." His **[classic example of
this is global environmental de­ gradation]{.underline}**, which
constitutes a global structuration process produced from the gener­ ally
"unintended consequences" of the ac­ tions of a "complex array of
sub­national, national, multi­national and trans­national actors." Thus,
although this global process emerges cumulatively from the globally sig­
nificant acts of individual and collective agents on multiple spatial
scales, he asserts that little can be done to counter this process due
to the lack of a specific intentional component to the policies of these
agents (Hay, 2001). However, this argument is significantly flawed.
Although a specifically­designed conscious plan to escalate global
environmental degradation certainly has never existed, policymakers have
been long aware that this global process has been systematically
generated by the global economic regime for decades. It is now no longer
credible to claim that powerful governments, agencies and institutions
are unaware of the devastating ecological impact of the policies of the
global economic regime. **[Yet the same array of policies continues to
be implemented]{.underline}** and actively promulgated by Western in­
ternational financial institutions. Thus, im­ plicit intention as to the
global process of environmental degradation can be said to have formed
on the part of these govern­ ments, agencies and institutions, which are
implementing policies to secure their per­ ceived interests with reckless
indifference as to their impact on much of the world. **[The same
argument]{.underline}** in principle **[can be applied to the escalation
of impoverishment that has accompanied globalization]{.underline}** as
promoted by two key Western financial institutions, ex­ amined here as
principal examples: the IMF and the World Bank.

### **[Explains/RC Discrimination]{.underline}** 

#### Identity politics and social movements are disengaged with the political economy -- it's the root cause of discrimination 

**Langman and ryan '9** (Lauren Langman, Loyola University Chicago,
Illinois. Maureen Ryan, Northwestern University, Illinois. "Capitalism
and the Carnival Character: The Escape from Reality". Critical
sociology, 2009. <http://crs.sagepub.com)> kb

[As the nature of the political power shifted away from nation-states
towards globalized cap- ital, party-based interest group politics has
waned. But so too has interest group politics been challenged from new
directions]{.underline}, namely, [an identity politics in which various
lifestyle groups and new social movements seek political and cultural
representations. Identity politics can be seen as a movement in which
hitherto thwarted subaltern groups such as women, gays and lesbians, and
people of marginalized races and ethnicities, seek to valorize their
identi- ties and so gain recognition and dignity. Quite often these
groups demand laws and agendas to redress past injustices and address
current grievances]{.underline}. The women's movements have had major
impact in changing discrimination policies and employment opportunities.
Gays have been successful in reducing discrimination and harassment and
in funding AIDs research and treatment. In similar ways, these new
social movements have made the world aware of environmental degradation
and global warming. [While most such social movements have been
progressive and indeed have laudable goals, we would raise important
caveats concerning identity politics. More often than not, such
movements ignore the underlying role of the political economy in
sustaining sexual discrimination or pollution]{.underline}. Further,
[one of the most important consequences of identity politics has been to
fragment what few progressive forces yet endure in the globalized world.
To a great extent, many new social movements, like the culture
industries, offer 'micro-spheres' of empowerment that have marginal
impact on the larger world.]{.underline}

Gramsci identified [two]{.underline} distinct [methods of]{.underline}
politico-[social control:]{.underline} physical control or
\"[domination\"]{.underline} and ideological control [or
hegemony]{.underline} through consent (1999). Any discussion of the
distinct types of politicosocial control elaborated by Gramsci requires
an epochal delineation and a global context. But it is the job of the
\"organic intellectuals\" to decide when and what strategy is called for
in particular on the basis of a realization that external control
requires effective internal control. [The success of the
military]{.underline} (coercive) operations overseas, requires effective
social imperialism. [As the level of distrust against the United States
increases]{.underline}, globally, and as the domestic problems mount
\"[coercion rather than consensus\" becomes a more viable
alternative]{.underline} (Harvey, 2003:77). \"[**An unholy alliance**
between state powers]{.underline} and the predatory aspects of finance
capitalism [forms the cutting edge of \'vulture capitalism\' that is as
much about]{.underline} cannibalistic practices and [**forced
devaluations** as it is about achieving harmonious global
development]{.underline}\" (Harvey, 2003:136). [The occupation of Iraq
and Afghanistan]{.underline} in the age of concerted and spreading
challenges to global capitalism in general and neo-liberalism in
particular attest to a global class conflict. And they remain and [will
continue to present the greatest imperial crises for
America]{.underline} while in her neo-liberal and neoconservative mode.
[The human cost]{.underline} at the present and in the future and the
devastating impact on future generations, both in Iraq and in the United
States [will dwarf]{.underline} the current and future [expenditures
associated with the actual use of personnel and weapons]{.underline} in
the occupation and the attempt at subduing Iraq. But [the cost of this
neo-liberal]{.underline}/neo-conservative [militarism and
regime]{.underline} change/[building, disguised as the \"**war on
Terror**]{.underline}\", and the export of \"democracy\" -produced by
the contemporary \"organic\" as well as traditional intellectuals,
[ought to be viewed in the context]{.underline} [of **greater hegemonic
strategy** for world domination]{.underline}. This attempt, however, has
several obstacles none of which can easily be ignored. And it is a
mistake to think that only a particular party in office rather than the
structure itself creates such crises and/or show hegemonic tendencies.
To attribute the imperial practices to a particular political party,
then assumes a style of management or variations in the composition of
the class (as often erroneously assumed) in each period a particular
political party is in power. [The \"different]{.underline} and sometimes
rival [conceptions of empire can]{.underline} even [become
internalized]{.underline} in the same space\" (Harvey, 1990:5), [and
only it is the expression of imperial tendencies that changes
(i.e]{.underline}., alleged Clinton\'s
\"**[demilitarization]{.underline}**\" and Bush\'s militarism). The line
of demarcation in all levels is blurred. In fact the identification of
Keynesianism with the U.S. Democratic Party is increasingly a misplaced
alliance. As Chalmers Johnson (20 07:68) points out \"Traditional
Keynesianism is a stable two party system composed of deficit spending
in bad times and debt payment in good times. Military Keynesianism is an
unstable one party system. With no political check, debt accrues until
it reaches a crisis point.\" The modern fiscal policy was born and
nurtured in the context of Keynesian strategy of saving capitalism, but
it neither prescribed nor forecasted such a fiscal crisis as the United
States national debt. And certainly, [as an ideology designed to save
capitalism]{.underline} from without, did not and could not provide
answers to its internal contradictions. \"The public finances are one of
the best starting points for an investigation of the society, especially
though not exclusively for its political life\" (cited in O\'Connor,
1971:3).

### AT: Perm -- Reform Bad

#### Neoliberalism guarantees systematic Capitalist failure---reforms can't solve

Neoliberalism and Capitalist Failure Many of the symptoms of the
[failure of capitalism]{.underline} described above [are well-known.
Nevertheless, **they are often attributed not to capitalism as a system,
but simply to neoliberalism,**]{.underline} viewed as a particular
paradigm of capitalist development that can be replaced by another,
better one. [For many people on the left, **the answer to neoliberalism
or disaster capitalism is a return to welfare-state liberalism**, market
regulation, or]{.underline} some form of limited social democracy, and
thus [to a more rational capitalism]{.underline}. It is not the failure
of capitalism itself that is perceived as the problem, but rather the
[failure of neoliberal capitalism.]{.underline} In contrast, the
[Marxian tradition understands **neoliberalism as an inherent outgrowth
of late capitalism**]{.underline}, associated with the domination of
monopoly-finance capital. A **[critical-historical analysis of
neoliberalism is therefore crucial both to grounding our understanding
of capitalism today and uncovering the reason why all alternatives to
neoliberalism and its capitalist absolutism are closed within the system
itself.]{.underline}** The term neoliberalism had its origin in the
early 1920s, in the Marxian critique of Ludwig von Mises's Nation,
State, and Economy (1919) and Socialism: An Economic and Sociological
Analysis (1922), both of which were written as virulent anti-socialist
tracts, constituting the foundational works of neoliberal-capitalist
ideology.45 In these works, Mises, then employed by the Vienna Chamber
of Commerce, insisted that the "old liberalism" had to be "relaid" in
such a way as to defeat socialism. In the process, he equated socialism
with "destructionism," insisted that monopoly was consistent with
capitalist free competition, defended unlimited inequality, and argued
that consumers exercised "democracy" through their purchases, which were
equivalent to ballots. He strongly condemned labor legislation,
compulsory social insurance, trade unions, unemployment insurance,
socialization (or nationalization), taxation, and inflation as the
enemies of his refurbished liberalism.46 So extreme were Mises's
neoliberal views that he explicitly took the side of the crass,
utilitarian pedagogue M'Choakumchild against the defiant young heroine
Sissy Jupe, as portrayed by Dickens in Hard Times. Dickens, Mises
claimed, had "taught millions to hate Liberalism and Capitalism."47 In
1921, Austro-Marxist Max Adler coined the term neoliberalism to
designate Mises's attempt to refurbish a fading liberal order through a
new ideology of market fetishism. This was followed by a sharp criticism
of Mises's neoliberal ideology in 1923 by the gifted Austro-Marxist
Helene Bauer. In 1924, the German Marxist Alfred Meusel wrote a lengthy
critique of Mises, entitled "Neoliberalism" ("Der Neu-Liberalismus") for
the leading German socialist theoretical journal Die Gesellschaft,
edited by Rudolf Hilferding.48 [Building on a wealth of Marxian
analysis, Adler, Bauer, and Meusel attacked Mises's claim that an
unregulated capitalism was the only rational economic
system]{.underline} and that socialism was equivalent to destructionism.
They [**strongly challenged his ahistorical depiction of a harmonious
capitalism that promoted free exchange and free trade** through the
market mechanism]{.underline}. A serious [logical flaw]{.underline} in
Mises's analysis, they contended, [was the **systematic bifurcation
built into his neoliberal ideology,** whereby trade unions were
considered constraints on trade while employers' associations and
monopolistic corporations were justified as consistent with free
competition]{.underline}. Likewise, it was noted that Mises advocated a
[strong state to repress working-class struggles in the name of a
self-regulating market system]{.underline}, even when state action on
behalf of workers was condemned as anti-free market and a form of class
terror. For Meusel, Mises was "a faithful servant of the mobile
capitalist" or international finance capital. Later, in 1926, the
protofascist economist Othmar Spann criticized the atavistic attempt to
revert to a more extreme version of classical liberalism, referring to
this in his Types of Economic Theory as "The Neo-Liberal Trend."49 In
1927, in his work Liberalism, Mises himself distinguished between "the
older liberalism and...neoliberalism" on the basis of the commitment of
the former to equality, in contrast to the rejection of equality (other
than so-called equality of opportunity) by the latter.50
[Neoliberalism]{.underline}, as it first emerged from Mises's pen, was
thus viewed by Marxian critics in the 1920s (and even by some figures on
the right[) **as an attempt to rationalize a monopoly or finance capital
far removed from the precepts of classical liberalism**. It was designed
to **provide the intellectual basis for capitalist class warfare against
not only socialism, but all attempts at social regulation and social
democracy: a no**]{.underline}-quarter-given attack on the working
class. Mises's assault on socialism, together with that of his protégé
Friedrich Hayek, was motivated in part by a profound disenchantment with
Red Vienna under the sway of Austro-Marxism, which was inspired by
figures like Adler, Otto Bauer, and Karl Renner.51 Conversely, it was
this same political environment of Red Vienna, which dominated Austrian
politics from 1919--32, that inspired Karl Polanyi, who was strongly
influenced by Adler and Otto Bauer, to develop a crushing critique of
the neoliberal belief in the self-regulating market---later to form the
basis of The Great Transformation (1946).52 In the 1930s to 1960s,
following the Great Depression and the Second World War, neoliberal
ideology waned in the context of the deepening crisis of capitalism. In
the early 1930s, as the storm clouds gathered over Europe, Mises served
as an economic advisor to Austrofascist Chancellor-dictator Engelbert
Dollfuss prior to the Nazi takeover of Austria.53 He later emigrated to
Switzerland and then to the United States, enjoying the support of the
Rockefeller Foundation and teaching at New York University. Meanwhile,
Hayek was recruited by the London School of Economics at the instigation
of the early neoliberal British economist Lionel Robbins. The
post-Second World War years in the West were known as the age of Keynes.
Spurred on by increased state spending (particularly on the military in
the context of the Cold War), the rebuilding of the war-torn European
and Japanese economies, the expansion of the sales effort, waves of
automobilization in both the United States and Europe, and two major
regional wars in Asia---capitalist economies grew rapidly for a
quarter-century.54 Meanwhile, faced with the threat of the alternative
model represented by the Soviet Union, and the advent of strong unions
as a result of the developments of the 1930s and '40s, the West moved in
the direction of Keynesianism, social democracy, and the welfare state.
Nevertheless, the [tendency toward economic stagnation already exhibited
in the 1930s **remained as a structural flaw of the
system**]{.underline}, temporarily masked by the so-called Golden Age of
rapid growth and increasing income for workers that immediately followed
the Second World War. The giant corporations of monopoly capitalism
succeeded in appropriating ever-greater surplus in both absolute and
relative terms, which was concentrated in the hands of ever-fewer wealth
holders, [leading to a tendency toward overaccumulation of capital and
manufacturing overcapacity, countered in part by a massive expansion of
the sales effort, militarism, and imperialism, but with ever-lessening
effect in stimulating the economy.]{.underline} U.S. imperialism and the
proliferation of dollars abroad led to a breakdown in the Bretton Woods
system that had stabilized world trade in the early post-Second World
War period, causing Richard Nixon to end the dollar-gold standard in
1971. This was associated with a slowdown in the U.S. economy from the
late 1960s on, as the Vietnam War was winding down, resulting in a
structural crisis of the capitalist system in the mid--1970s, which was
to mark the beginning of decades of economic stagnation and a long
decline in the trend rate of growth in the advanced capitalist
economies. [The major stimuli that sparked the post-Second World War
boom had all waned, **leaving the advanced capitalist economies in the
doldrum**s]{.underline}.55 [The first response to the structural crisis
of the capitalist system that emerged in the 1970s was to utilize
Keynesian demand-promotion to expand state spending]{.underline}. U.S.
civilian-government spending on goods and services as a percentage of
gross domestic product thus reached a peak during the Nixon
administration.56 This, plus the struggles of unions to maintain their
real wages in the crisis, while monopolistic corporations aggressively
raised prices to increase their profit margins, [led to a period of
stagflation (economic stagnation plus inflation).]{.underline}
Inflation, which depreciates accumulated wealth held in the form of
monetary assets, is a much greater immediate threat to the position of
the capitalist class than is economic stagnation, while for the working
class the situation is reversed. The result was the emergence of an
anti-Keynesian movement within the capitalist class, which designated
anything to the left of hardcore neoliberalism as socialist or
totalitarian in the manner of Hayek's Road to Serfdom, and sought to
reverse decades of modest working-class gains.57 There was a sharp turn
toward austerity and economic restructuring, initially under the guise
of monetarism and supply-side economics, and later taking a more
amorphous free-market character. A concerted effort to destroy unions by
combined political, economic, and juridical means was carried out,
eliminating what John Kenneth Galbraith in his American Capitalism had
once called the "countervailing power" of labor.58 Key to the
reemergence of neoliberalism in the post-Second World period was the
Mont Pèlerin Society, named after the Swiss spa where Mises, Hayek,
Robbins, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Raymond Aron, and others met
in 1947, to promote neoliberal economic and political ideas. The members
of the Mont Pèlerin Society generally referred to themselves as
classical liberals in the European sense. No doubt remembering the
devastating Marxist critiques of neoliberal ideology in the 1920s, they
eschewed the label neoliberal, which Mises himself had adopted in 1927,
and which had been put forward in the 1938 Walter Lippmann Colloquium in
Paris that Mises and Hayek attended.59 Instead, neoliberalism was
presented by its chief adherents in the Mont Pèlerin Society not as a
separate political ideology from, but as an extension of, classical
liberalism and attributable to inherent features of human nature. In
this way, as Michel Foucault argued, it was converted into a kind of
biopolitics.60 Nevertheless, while abandoning the neoliberal label, the
Mont Pèlerin Society, together with the Department of Economics at the
University of Chicago, was to be a bastion of neoliberal ideology---in
precisely the sense that it had first emerged between the world wars. In
the Keynesian era of the 1950s and '60s, figures like Mises, Hayek,
Friedman, and James Buchanan remained on the margins, though heavily
bankrolled by private foundations.61 But with the return of economic
stagnation in the 1970s, neoliberal intellectuals were actively
recruited at the apex of monopoly capital in order to provide the
ideological basis for an ongoing corporate campaign to restructure the
capitalist economy, deliberately targeting labor, the state, and the
underdeveloped economies of the global South. Central to neoliberal
philosophy from the beginning was the defense of concentrated corporate
capital and class dynasties, which were portrayed as representing
free-market competition and entrepreneurship.62 The very virulence of
neoliberal anti-socialism meant that it represented the drive to a
complete market-privatization of social life. In Margaret Thatcher's
London and Ronald Reagan's Washington, figures like Hayek and Friedman
became the symbols of the neoliberal era, sometimes called the age of
Hayek. The new so-called Nobel Prize in Economics, or the Sveriges
Riksbank (Bank of Sweden) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred
Nobel, established by the Bank of Sweden in 1969, was controlled from
its inception by ultraconservative neoliberal economists. Seven members
of the Mont Pèlerin Society, including Hayek, Friedman, Stigler, and
Buchanan received the prize between 1974 and 1992, while even mildly
social-democratic economists were all but excluded.63 Neoliberalism as
an economic ideology was largely ineffectual in normal economic-policy
terms, judged by its lack of success in promoting growth, since, like
neoclassical economics itself, it sought to deny (or rationalize) the
reality of an economy dominated by big business and concentrated
power.64 Nevertheless, it served as an effective political-economic
strategy for big business and the emerging billionaire class in an age
where monopoly-finance capital sought to seize control of all monetary
flows in society.65 Although capitalist economies continued to stagnate
with growth rates diminishing decade by decade, the surplus capital in
the hands of the corporate rich not only increased, but by virtue of
financialization, globalization, and the revolution in digital
technology, new forms of amassing wealth were created.66
Financialization---the relative shift of the economy from production to
finance---opened up vast new avenues to speculation and wealth
formation, relatively removed from capital investment in new productive
capacity (that is, real capital accumulation). Globalization meant not
only new markets, but, more importantly---through the global labor
arbitrage---the appropriation of huge economic surpluses from the
overexploitation of low-wage labor in the periphery that ended up in the
financial coffers of multinational corporations and wealthy individuals
in the rich countries.67 The benefits of imperialism to workers in the
center of the capitalist economy no longer included incremental gains in
employment and income associated with the global dominance of
production, but, at best, could be said to contribute to cheaper prices
from the outsourcing of production by multinational corporations,
symbolized by the growth of Walmart. Meanwhile, digital technology
created the basis of a new globalized surveillance capitalism, buying
and selling information on the population, primarily motivated by the
sales effort, leading to the creation of enormous information-technology
monopolies.68 [Vast increases in inequality and wealth were justified as
returns for innovation, always attributed to a very few rather than as
the collective product of society.]{.underline} In the new era of
expropriation, all was up for grabs: education, health systems,
transportation, housing, land, cities, prisons, insurance, pensions,
food, entertainment. **[All exchanges in society were to be fully
commodified, corporatized, and financialized]{.underline}**, with the
funds flowing into financial centers and feeding speculation on capital
gains, leveraged by debt. **[Human communication was itself to be turned
into a commodity. All in the name of a free-market
society.]{.underline}**

#### Green growth is normatively inferior to degrowth---only a strong foundation in environmental sustainability can successfully stop degradation and challenge dominant growth paradigms

Ample [scientific research shows that human activity, particularly the
consumption levels of the over-consuming classes in the affluent parts
of the world, is degrading the natural environment]{.underline} on which
we depend (e.g. IPCC, 2014; Steffen et al., 2015; WWF, 2016). Scientists
agree that changes are needed to stop environmental degradation (Ripple
et al., 2017). The most widely accepted solution to stop the degradation
of the natural environment is green growth[. Green growth mainly relies
on technological and market innovations to improve the efficiency of
production and thus, decouple the use of natural resources and
environmental impacts from continued economic growth]{.underline} (UNEP,
2011). [However, research indicates that **green growth is highly
unlikely to succeed in stopping environmental degradation**]{.underline}
(e.g. Ward et al., 2016; Wiedmann et al., 2015). A growing body of
[research suggests **degrowth as an alternative solution**]{.underline}
(Weiss and Cattaneo, 2017). [**Degrowth questions the viability of
continued economic growth and argues that the sustainable use of natural
resources requires more fundamental changes to the organization of
societ**y]{.underline}, including substantial reductions in production
and consumption levels in developed countries (D\'Alisa et al., 2015;
Jackson, 2016). Despite the arguments in favor of degrowth, green growth
continues to be the dominant solution for environmental sustainability,
while degrowth has remained a marginal undertaking. Degrowth is seldom
considered in policy initiatives for environmental sustainability.
Initiatives such as the Paris Agreement and the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals presuppose continued economic growth
(Alexander, 2015; Hickel, 2017). Although in recent years degrowth has
begun to attract academic interest, including the publication of special
issues on the topic (e.g. Schneider et al., 2010; Sekulova et al.,
2013), the impact remains marginal. Thus, making degrowth research part
of the mainstream agenda requires further arguments. Whereas much
previous research has investigated the feasibility of the solutions for
environmental sustainability proposed by green growth and degrowth, Des
Jardins (2001) argued that [**environmental problems need to be
understood as ethical issues**.]{.underline} He argued that [scientific
analyses of environmental problems alone cannot determine how we should
respond to environmental problems]{.underline}; a consideration and
evaluation of the normative assumptions that, implicitly or explicitly,
lie behind alternative courses of action are needed. This article
conducts a comparative analysis of the normative foundations of green
growth and degrowth using frameworks from critical social theory.
Critical social theory is a research approach that explicitly pursues
the normative aim of social arrangements that would improve the
possibilities for human flourishing in a global and inclusive manner
(Cooke, 2006). **[Critical social theory explicitly recognizes that any
effort to transform society, such as green growth or degrowth, rests on
some normative ideal]{.underline}**, and offers a framework for
assessing the normative assumptions of proposed solutions. Thus,
critical social theory allows for an analysis of green growth and
degrowth that explicitly recognizes them as normative projects and
assesses their normative foundations. Though critical social theory has
been argued to be well suited to analyze environmental sustainability
(Myers and Klein, 2011) as well as degrowth (Fremaux, 2014), few
previous studies have actually used critical social theory to analyze
environmental sustainability. Exceptions include Fuchs (2017), who used
critical social theory to analyze the broader concept of sustainable
development, and Fremaux (2014), who discussed the insights of so-called
Frankfurt School critical theorists into degrowth research. This article
analyzes the normative ideals of green growth and degrowth and the
normative justifications for these ideals. **[Normative ideals rely on
justifications that must be critically scrutinized]{.underline}**
(Cooke, 2006, 14e24), [particularly in a situation where competing
solutions, such as green growth and degrowth, are offered.]{.underline}
This article utilizes Benhabib\'s (1986) framework of the
explanatory-diagnostic and anticipatory-utopian dimensions of critical
social theory, as well as Cooke\'s (2006) framework for normative
justifications to assess the normative justifications for green growth
and degrowth in terms of the overall aim of environmental
sustainability. The article\'s main contribution to the literature
consists of a critical social theory approach for a comparison of the
normative justifications of green growth and degrowth. [The analysis
strengthens the argument for degrowth]{.underline} and thus, pushes the
debate between green growth and degrowth forward. Section 2 presents
critical social theory and the theoretical frameworks that are used in
this article to analyze green growth and degrowth. Section 3 discusses
the current degradation of the natural environment, as well as the
normative ideal of environmental preservation, shared by green growth
and degrowth. Section 4 presents green growth and degrowth as
alternative solutions for environmental sustainability. Section 5
performs a comparative analysis of the normative foundations of green
growth and degrowth and their normative justifications. Finally, section
6 discusses the conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis, its
limitations, as well as suggestions for future research. The analysis in
this article recognized green growth and degrowth as normative projects
and used frameworks from critical social theory to analyze the normative
foundations of green growth and degrowth. [The analysis showed that
green growth and degrowth work toward different normative
ideals]{.underline} that are justified in different ways. [Although both
green growth and degrowth state environmental preservation as a
normative ideal, **green growth was shown in practice to prioritize the
normative ideal of economic growth, while degrowth prioritizes
environmental preservation**.]{.underline} The analysis assessed the
normative validity of the normative ideals behind green growth and
[degrowth and showed that **environmental preservation has stronger
normative validity than economic**]{.underline} growth. Thus, [the
analysis showed that **degrowth has a stronger normative justification**
than green growth and should be preferred.]{.underline} By explicitly
assessing the normative validity of the normative ideals behind green
growth and degrowth, this article extends previous arguments for
degrowth (e.g. D\'Alisa et al., 2015; Jackson, M. Sandberg et al. /
Journal of Cleaner Production 206 (2019) 133e141 139 2016; Kallis, 2011;
Muraca, 2013). By adding the normative dimension to the analysis, the
article shows that [as a normative vision for the future**, green growth
lacks a strong normative foundation to justify its dominant position as
a solution to environmental sustainability**. The analysis strengthens
the argument for degrowth as it was shown to be a normatively more
strongly justified vision for the future.]{.underline} Thus, the
analysis contributes to the debate about green growth and degrowth by
establishing normative grounds for focusing efforts for environmental
sustainability on degrowth rather than green growth. The analysis in
this article assessed green growth and degrowth as solutions to
environmental degradation. Thus, [the focus was the environmental
dimension of sustainability]{.underline}. Future research is needed to
complement the analysis in this article with a consideration of the
social dimension of sustainability. Degrowth explicitly states both
environmental and social sustainability, specifically human well-being
and social equity (Schneider et al., 2010), as goals. Future research is
needed to analyze these normative ideals pertaining to social
sustainability advanced by degrowth and their normative validity. In
particular, the compatibility of these normative ideals with the
normative ideal of environmental preservation needs further
consideration (Büchs and Koch, 2017). As degrowth is a vision for the
future that is still under development and open, a number of
uncertainties surround it. The analysis in this article assumed that
degrowth does not compromise on its goal of reducing production and
consumption levels to realize environmental preservation. However, more
research is needed on how this can be achieved, particularly in
conjunction with degrowth\'s social goals. The potential to realize
degrowth\'s normative ideals must be continuously evaluated, and
degrowth proponents must be willing to change course if their proposed
solutions seem to be insufficient to reach their goals. Despite this
uncertainty, this article suggests that [degrowth shows more potential
than green growth as a solution to environmental
degradation]{.underline}. Thus, efforts for environmental sustainability
in practice and in academia should focus on degrowth rather than green
growth[, and **the dominant paradigm of green growth should be
questioned and degrowth initiatives given attention**. This requires
transformations at every level of society, from international
environmental policy and economic organization to civil society and
individuals\' consumption habits]{.underline} (Jackson, 2016). The aim
of this article has been to encourage future efforts for degrowth by
strengthening the argument for degrowth.

#### The perm fails -- capitalism in the context of the environment is inherently intertwined with the administrative state -- only a complete abandonment can solve

**Dryzek, 9** -- Centenary Professor at the Centre for Deliberative
Democracy and Global Governance at the [University of
Canberra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Canberra)\'s
Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis (John S., "Ecology and
discursive democracy: Beyond liberal capitalism and the administrative
state", Taylor & Francis, 2-25-2009,

But this combination would still have to overcome all the other
shortcomings of literal democracy and administration --- shortcomings
rooted in the logic of these institutions. Though productive
combinations of existing institutions are conceivable, I would argue
[from an ecological vantage point that these combinations generally
compound error, rather than correct it]{.underline}. So **[the
capitalist market \"imprisons\" both liberal democracy and the
administrative state by ruling out any significant actions that would
hinder business profitability]{.underline}**. [Liberal democracy and
administration both have a problem-solving logic which proceeds by
analytic decomposition, the former according to the concern and weight
of particular interests, the latter by the analytical administrative
mind. Their combination preserves the basic idea of decomposition, but
in combining two different logics the result is likely to be less
rational than either in isolation, for each logic will triumph at
particular unpredictable points.]{.underline} Above all, these extant
systems are all manifestations of a particular kind of
post-Enlightenment rationality. All **[embody an instrumental-analytic
orientation to problem solving, hence all have the tendency to mistake
problem displacement for problem resolution.]{.underline}** This
**[rejection of the possibility of felicitous combinations of the three
extant political-economic mechanisms short-circuits many of the
contemporary debates about the environment and political
economy]{.underline}**. If we think of the three mechanisms as
constituting a triangle, then many of these debates concern movements in
both directions along all three sides of the triangle. Thus Paehlke
favors reducing the domain of the administrative state and increasing
that of liberal democracy.16 He notes that, contrary to the projections
and recommendations of ecological centralizers such as Heilbroner and
Ophuls, [the addition of environmental issues to the political agenda in
the United States and Canada in the last two decades has been
accompanied by more openness in policy debates rather than
less]{.underline}. This openness has taken the form of public hearings,
interest group activity, right-to-know laws, public inquiries, and so
forth. Heilbroner and Ophuls, of course, want to move in exactly the
opposite direction on this side of the triangle. Contemptuous of the
messiness, drift, and fragmentation of liberal democracy, they have no
hesitation in proposing leviathan. They would expect Paehike\'s
proposals to exacerbate the political tragedy of the commons by
increasing the access of interests claiming a share of environmental
resources. Paehlke, for his part, believes that the energy to confront
environmental crises is best generated by the mobilization of democratic
participation, not centralized administration, and that the positive
moments in the record of environmental improvement through governmental
action bear him out [If we turn to the tradeoff between capitalism and
the administrative state, again we find advocates of movement in both
directions. Regulatory reformers want to reduce the discretionary power
of administrative agencies, and to increase the role of market
strategies such as systems of standards, charges, and markets in
pollution rights]{.underline}. Some of these [reformers would be happy
with thorough privatization of decision-making authority, and so entrust
our ecological future to capitalism.]{.underline} There is of course
**[a long tradition of argument for movement in exactly the reverse
direction]{.underline}**. Ecological Hobbesians such as Heilbroner and
Hardin are no more enamoured of the decentralized market than they are
of decentralized liberal democracy. The conservation movement in the
United States at the turn of the century advocated scientific expertise
embodied in administration as a corrective to the irrationalities of
capitalism in determining the pattern of resource use. But neutral
expertise embedded in administration is a myth under complex ecological
conditions, and this is especially true when one adds the moral and
political dimensions of issues. On the third side of the triangle, [the
most prominent arguments are those of mainstream environmental interest
groups, which reject capitalism (though only in its particular
manifestations, not as an overall system) in favor of liberal democratic
venues for the resolution of environmental problems.]{.underline} On the
opposite side of this argument are found public choice theorists and
microeconomists who combine an exposé of the economic irrationality of
interest group politics (especially with regard to the dominance of
partial interests over the general social welfare) with enthusiasm for
the welfare-maximizing effects of market allocation, especially once
rights to private property have been welldefined. One prominent school
of thought here is the \"new resource economics,\" which advocates
privatization of the public lands (including national parks) in the
American West as an alternative to their abuse at the hands of special
interests.17 These interests, be they timber beasts or industrial
tourists, get a place at the trough and feed upon both the public
treasury and the ecological endowment, all at the expense of the public
interest, as a result of their success in the political game. My earlier
arguments suggest that when it comes to the third side of the triangle
both schools of thought are correct in their critique of the other, but
neither proposes a meaningful alternative. Thus do the debates about
changing the mix of present-day mechanisms move in both directions on
each side of a triangle. But if all three corners of the triangle are
undesirable locations, then so are all coordinates within it. The
question then becomes how structural possibilities beyond the triangle
might be located.

### AT: Perm -- Marxist Prereq

#### Adopting a Marxist ideological critique of 21^st^ century capitalism is necessary to envision successful alternatives

Integrating Marxist ideals into 21^st^ century Repeating Marx [Facing
economic, political, ecological and ideological crises, we have to
repeat Marx today.]{.underline} Repeating Marx does not mean
mechanically applying Marx's thought to 21stcentury society. It also
does not mean to treat his writings as scriptures, from which one
repeats one and the same quotations over and over again. tripleC 16(2):
406-414, 2018 409 CC-BY-NC-ND: Creative Commons License, 2018. [First,
to repeat Marx today means to develop **analyses and critiques of class
and capitalism in the 21st century in a historical and dialectical
manner.** It means to study how capitalism, not just as economic
formation but also as societal formation]{.underline}, is transforming
and damaging human lives, society and nature. It means repeating Marx's
categories -- such as the commodity, labour, value, surplus-value class,
exploitation, capital, domination, ideology, class struggles,
means/relations/modes of production, means of communication, the general
intellect, communism, etc. -- in the 21st century. Marx was both a
historical and a dialectical thinker. [To repeat Marx in the 21st
century therefore **neither means to abolish his approach, theory and
politics, nor to completely re-invent them, nor to leave them
unchanged**.]{.underline} That capitalism is a historical and
dialectical system means that it changes through crises in order to
remain the same system of exploitation. To repeat Marx therefore means
to sublate Marx's categories based on a dialectic of continuity and
change. Whereas postmodernists have preached for decades that society
has completely changed, orthodox social theorists claim that nothing at
all has changed. Postmodernism overestimates change. The orthodoxy that
nothing ever changes in contrast overestimates continuity. Second,
[**the contemporary capitalist age is profoundly ideological**. To
understand and change society, we therefore need **to repeat Marx's
ideology critique**]{.underline}. Through consumer culture and
neoliberalism, we have experienced the commodification of (almost)
everything and the constant presence of ideologies that justify
commodity logic in all realms of everyday life. [Commodity fetishism as
ideology immanent to capital itself has thereby become universal. Rising
inequalities have resulted in the intensification and extension
ideologies that distract attention from capitalist society]{.underline}
as the underlying cause of social problems. The most evident form of
political fetishism has in recent times been the rise of new political
nationalisms. Third, [to repeat Marx today means **to envision and
struggle for alternatives to capitalism**]{.underline}. Marx stresses
that history is not pre-determined and that humans make their own
history. Even in dark times, it is never too late. And [it is especially
in such times important to envision alternatives]{.underline} and think
of -- and work towards -- ways to overcome the gap between what could be
and what is. [Capitalism is not the end of history. **In order to
humanise society, fundamental societal change is needed**.]{.underline}
To repeat Marx means to renew, recast, revitalise, rethink, reconsider,
and reinterpret Marx today. 3. 200 Years of Social Struggles for
Alternatives to Capitalism [The financial crisis of 2008]{.underline}
and the subsequent regimes of social, political and ideological
austerity -- accompanied by the rise of new nationalisms and
authoritarian forms of capitalism -- [gave new momentum to critical
analyses of contemporary capitalism that are not limited to academic
debates]{.underline}, but are starting to penetrate the public arena and
mainstream discourse. [Current debates focus on the possibility to
envision alternatives to rather than alternatives of capitalism. If we
want to take the project of envisioning and realising an alternative to
capitalism seriously, it becomes clear that **we have to move beyond the
mere critique of capitalism and have to interpret and put into praxis
Marx's legacy for the relevance of realising alternatives
today**.]{.underline} The implication is that we have to recognise that
on the one side the functioning of [21st-century capitalism is slightly
different to the capitalism described by Karl Marx]{.underline} in
Capital, and, on the other, [that the capitalism we are living in today
constitutes an evolution of 19th-century capitalism]{.underline} and, as
such, the system reproduces itself fol- lowing the same dynamics of
exploitation, accumulation, and commodification outlined by Marxian
analyses. If we then turn our focus towards the alternatives, the main
questions become: What would the alternative system (or systems) to
capitalism look like? How can we realise alternatives? Answering this
question is probably the main challenge for radical theorists today.
[The historical trajectory of capitalism is crowded with attempts to
establish alternative systems]{.underline}. The search for alternatives
took an important turn in the Paris Commune in 1871 and passed through
the revolutions and resistance movements that characterised the entire
course of the twentieth century -- in Russia, Germany, India, Ireland,
Nicaragua, Spain, Italy, Indonesia, China, Cuba, the 1968 movement, the
Zapatista movement in Mexico, the most recent Bolivarian revolution in
Venezuela, and in the Rojava movement in Syria. History also reminds us
that many of these revolutions have been and are repressed with
violence, while others led to authoritarian, centralised and repressive
regimes. A systematic attempt to establish a 'socialism of the
twenty-first century' comes from Latin America and the various
governments settled there in the last decade: Evo Morales in Bolivia,
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, Fernando
Lugo in Paraguay, Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, or Tabaré Vázquez and José
Mujica in Uruguay. The project of a socialism for the twenty-first
century is characterised by the opposition to neoliberalism, a rejection
of Soviet-style 'state socialism', and a deep focus on rethinking 'the
good living' (in Spanish: buen vivir) in harmony with the nature. As
defined by Michael A. Lebowitz (2016), "socialism for the twenty-first
century is a revolutionary restoration -- the return to Marx's
understanding of socialism \[...\] \[that\] puts human development, the
full development of human potential at the centre". Nonetheless, former
Brazilian president Lula's recent controversial sentence for corruption
and money laundering and the popular uprisings in Venezuela against the
government of current president Nicolás Maduro constitute a sign that
the so-called 'pink-tide' Latin American project -- that started with
the election of Hugo Chavez in 1998 -- is encountering both internal and
external challenges and, as the Venezuelan case shows, has some
contradictory and problematic contours. While there is a certain crisis
of the Latin American left-wing project, in the United States and
Europe, the rise of socialist politicians like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy
Corbyn as a reaction [to the politics of the neoliberal 'third way' and
the financialisation of the economy indicates that also in these parts
of the world socialism is a force to reckon with]{.underline}. Corbyn
and Sanders are only the two most famous examples. In other European
countries, political movements and parties are explicitly recalling in
their programmes aspects of equality, solidarity, redistribution and
social justice and are advocating policies like universal and
unconditional basic income, free education, and the expansion of the
provision of public services. All of these political programmes share
not only a critique of neoliberalism as the political paradigm that has
dominated the last forty years, but most importantly the [consciousness
that we need to establish positive, progressive, democratic alternatives
capable of overcoming capitalism. To foster this urgency, there is not
just the need to overcome social inequalities, but also to avoid the
planet's ecological catastrophe. **Social and ecological justice are not
mutually exclusive, but two essential and profoundly intertwined
points** of the contemporary radical Left's political
agenda.]{.underline} During Marx's lifetime, the environmental crisis
was not as severe and pressing as it has become today. In his critique,
he described [the rupture between humanity and the rest of nature caused
by the modes of capitalist production that is now central to the
writings of many Marxist and ecological thinkers]{.underline} and that
has been termed the "met- tripleC 16(2): 406-414, 2018 411 CC-BY-NC-ND:
Creative Commons License, 2018. abolic rift" (Foster 2000). Marx was an
early radical thinker of environmental sustainability (Fuchs 2006), when
he argued that "a whole society, a nation, or even all simultaneously
existing societies taken together, are not the owners of the globe" and
that humans have the responsibility to hand down the globe "to
succeeding generations in an improved condition" (Marx 1894, 784).
[Whether one believes that future society should be inspired by the
principles of eco-socialism or by hyper-technological post-work ideas,
the timelessness of Marxist thinking is evident]{.underline} throughout
this special issue.

### AT: Perm -- Ecosocialism 

#### Ecosocialism gets co-opted by the state in the world of the perm

**Angus 11** Editor of Climate and Capitalism, (Ian,\"How to make an
ecosocialist revolution,\" Climate & Capitalism,
https://climateandcapitalism.com/2011/10/07/how-to-make-an-ecosocialist-revolution//rL

**What is an [[ecosocialist revolution]{.mark}?]{.underline}** When we
say *revolution*, we are talking about a profound change in the way
humans relate to the earth, in how we produce and reproduce, in almost
everything humans do and how we do it. What we're aiming for is [[not
just a reorganization of capitalism, and not just changes in ownership,
but]{.underline}]{.mark} for what Fred Magdoff, in an article in a
recent issue of [*[Monthly
Review]{.underline}*](http://monthlyreview.org/2011/01/01/ecological-civilization/),
calls ["[a truly ecological civilization]{.mark} -- one that exists in
harmony with natural systems."]{.underline} Magdoff lists eight
characteristics that such a civilization would have. It would: stop
growing when basic human needs are satisfied; not entice people to
consume more and more; protect natural life support systems and respect
the limits to natural resources, taking into account needs of future
generations; [make decisions based on long-term societal/ecological
needs, while not neglecting short-term needs of people;]{.underline} run
as much as possible on current (including recent past) energy instead of
fossil fuels; [[foster human characteristics and a culture of
cooperation, sharing, reciprocity, and responsibility]{.mark} to
neighbors and community; [make possible the full development of human
potential]{.mark}, and; promote truly democratic political and economic
decision making for local, regional, and multiregional
needs.]{.underline} As Fred Magdoff says, a society with those
characteristics would be "the opposite of capitalism in essentially all
respects." **Not easy or quick** Achieving such a change is absolutely
essential -- but we should not delude ourselves that it will happen
simply or quickly. I've found that most environmentalists and most
socialists seriously underestimate just how big a task we have set
ourselves, how big the change will have to be, how difficult it will be,
and how long it will take. Forty years ago, in 1971, Barry Commoner, one
of the first modern socialists to write about the environmental crisis,
estimated that in order to reverse the environmental destruction that he
could *then* see in the United States and to rebuild industry and
agriculture on an ecologically sound basis, "most of the nation's
resources for capital investment would need to be engaged in the task of
ecological reconstruction for at least a generation." The rate and
extent of environmental destruction has accelerated rapidly in the four
decades since Commoner wrote that. The time required and the cost of the
repairs and reconstruction have increased substantially. For example,
the United Nations recently estimated that it will take 30 years to
clean up the devastating damage caused by Shell Oil in the Ogoni
peoples' homeland in the Niger Delta. That's for an area of just 386
square miles -- about one-ninth the size of Sydney. [The Niger Delta is
a particularly horrible example of capitalism's ecocidal role, of
course, but there are many more examples around the world, enough to
dash any hope for an easy turnaround. That means that the title of my
talk today is a little misleading.]{.underline} I can't tell you how to
*make* an ecosocialist revolution, because the necessary changes will
take decades, in circumstances we can't predict. What's more, the
transformation will undoubtedly require new knowledge, and new science.
To paraphrase Marx, there is no recipe book for the chefs of the
ecological revolution. **Getting to the starting point** [But what we
can and must discuss is, how to get to the starting point. One of the
pioneers of revolutionary socialism and environmentalism was the great
British poet and artist William Morris]{.underline}. In 1893, he
described the starting point this way: "The first real victory of the
Social Revolution will be a the establishment not indeed of a complete
system of communism in a day, which is absurd, but of a revolutionary
administration whose *definite and conscious aim* will be to prepare and
further, in all available ways, human life for such a system ..." [We
could combine William Morris's statement with Fred Magdoff's
terminology, to summarize the central goal of the ecosocialist movement
today: "A revolutionary administration whose *definite and conscious
aim* will be to prepare and further, in all available ways, human life
for an ecological civilization."]{.underline} In our new book, [*[Too
Many
People?]{.underline}*](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/search?q=Too-Many-People),
Simon Butler and I express that idea this way: "In every country, we
need governments that break with the existing order, that are answerable
only to working people, farmers, the poor, indigenous communities, and
immigrants -- in a word, to the victims of ecocidal capitalism, not its
beneficiaries and representatives." And we suggest some of the first
measures such governments might take. [Our suggestions include: rapidly
phasing out fossil fuels and biofuels, replacing them with clean energy
sources; actively supporting farmers to convert to ecological
agriculture; defending local food production and distribution;
introducing free and efficient public transport networks; restructuring
existing extraction, production, and distribution systems to eliminate
waste, planned obsolescence, pollution, and manipulative advertising,
and providing full retraining to all affected workers and communities;
retrofitting existing homes and buildings for energy efficiency; closing
down all military operations at home and elsewhere; transforming the
armed forces into voluntary teams charged with restoring ecosystems and
assisting the victims of environmental disasters]{.underline}. Our
suggestions aren't carved in stone, and I'm sure many of you in this
room can think of many other essential changes. For other valuable ideas
about what such a government would do, I encourage you to also look at
the "short term agenda for environmental activists" in the final chapter
of [*[What Every Environmentalist Needs to Know About
Capitalism]{.underline}*](http://astore.amazon.com/climaandcapit-20/detail/1583672419),
by John Bellamy Foster and Fred Magdoff, and at the program proposed
here in Australia in the *Socialist Alliance Climate Charter*. I stress
that we shouldn't wait for an ecosocialist government to make those
changes. On the contrary, we should be fighting for every one of those
measures today, as central elements of our fight for a better world.
Those are first steps, just the beginning -- building a fully ecological
civilization will involve much more. The longer it takes us to build a
movement that can get the process started, the more difficult the
ecosocialist revolution will be. [**Majority participation**
I]{.underline} have stressed the complexity and size of the task before
us not to discourage you, but to underline another essential point.
Social changes this sweeping will not happen just because they are the
right thing to do. Good ideas are not enough. Moral authority isn't
enough. [[An ecosocialist revolution cannot be made by a minority. It
cannot be imposed by politicians and bureaucrats]{.underline}]{.mark},
no matter how well meaning they might be. It will require the active
participation of the great majority of the people. In Marx's famous
words: "[[The emancipation of the working class must be the act of the
workers themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}." [This is not because democracy
is morally superior, but because the necessary changes cannot be carried
through, and will not be long-lasting, unless they are actively
supported, created and implemented, by the broadest possible range of
pe]{.underline}ople. Only majority support and involvement can possibly
overcome the opponents of change. The only way to overcome the forces
that now rule, the forces of global destruction, is to organize a
countervailing force that can stop them and remove them from power.
That's another fundamental truth about revolutions -- there is no such
thing as a win-win revolution, where everyone gains and no one loses.
[In a real revolution, the people who had power and privileges in the
old society lose their power and privileges in the new.]{.underline} A
few of those people may join in the revolutionary cause, and if so we
will welcome them to our cause. But most of them probably will not
support the majority. [Today, as in every human society for thousands of
years, there are powerful social groups that benefit from the existing
situation, and they will resist change no matter how obvious the need
for change may be]{.underline}. We only have to look at the present US
Congress or at Australia's Parliament to see powerful people who will
resist change even to the point of destroying the world. The climate
change deniers are not isolated cranks. They are well-financed
politicians, backed by some of the world's richest corporations, and
they are prepared to bring the world down to protect their power. You
know, whenever we talk about revolution, the powers that be accuse us of
plotting violence. In fact, most of the ecosocialists I know are pretty
nonviolent in their personal lives. I admit that many of us in Canada
like hockey, and I'm sure there are some footy fans here today, but that
doesn't translate into our political outlook. We don't want violence,
and we will be pleased if the transition to ecosocialism is entirely
peaceful. [Unfortunately, unlike in professional sports, what happens in
a revolution isn't entirely up to us. As we've seen in many countries,
the democratic election of popular governments by huge majorities has
never stopped defenders of the old order from trying to regain power
through violent means.]{.underline} And as the people of Venezuela and
Bolivia have shown, the best way to minimize and counteract the violence
of the reactionaries is to mobilize the largest possible number of
people to defend the revolutionary process. **A tale of two cities**
What forces will determine the outcome of the global environmental
crisis in the 21st century? Less than two years ago we had a strong
foretaste of the class lineup. In December 2009, the world's rich
countries sent delegations to Copenhagen with instructions not to save
the climate, but to block any action that might weaken their capitalist
economies or harm their competitive positions in world markets. And they
succeeded. [The backroom deal imposed by Obama was, as Fidel Castro
wrote, "nothing more than a joke]{.underline}." The follow-up deal that
they negotiated in Cancun was no better. The Copenhagen and Cancun
meetings made it clear that our rulers do not want to solve the climate
and ecological crises. Period. They place their narrow economic and
electoral interests before the survival of humanity. They will not
change course willingly. Five months after the Copenhagen meeting, a
very different meeting took place in Cochabamba, Bolivia. At the
invitation of Bolivian president Evo Morales, some 35,000 activists,
many of them indigenous people, came from more than 130 countries, to do
what Obama and his allies refused to do in Copenhagen -- to develop an
action program to save the environment. They drafted a [[People's
Agreement]{.underline}](https://pwccc.wordpress.com/support/) that
places responsibility for the climate crisis on the capitalist system
and on the rich countries that "have a carbon footprint five times
larger than the planet can bear". The World People's Conference adopted
[[18 major statements]{.underline}](https://pwccc.wordpress.com/),
covering topics from climate refugees to indigenous rights to technology
transfer, and much more. [It [is impossible to imagine such a program
coming out of any meeting of the wealthy powers, or out of any United
Nations conference]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Those two meetings, in
Copenhagen and Cochabamba, symbolize the great divide in the struggle
for the future of the earth and humanity. On one side, [a meeting
dominated by the rich and powerful, determined to save their wealth and
privileges, even if the world burns]{.mark}. On the other side,
indigenous people, small farmers and peasants, progressive activists and
working people of all kinds, determined to save the world from the rich
and powerful. The]{.underline} Cochabamba conference was a big step
towards a global movement that can actually change the world. It showed,
in a preliminary way, the alliance of forces that must be forged in each
country, and internationally, to end the environmentally destructive
capitalist system. We need students and academics and feminists and
scientists -- [but [we will not be able to change the world unless we
win the active participation of working people, farmers,
indigenous]{.mark} peoples and all of the oppressed. These are the
forces that the green left must ally with. These are the forces that we
must win to the perspective of ecosocialist revolution.]{.underline}

### AT: Cap Inev

#### Rejecting the notion of inevitable neoliberalism is critical to resistance -- surrender is a self-fulfilling prophecy 

**Hursh and Henderson**, associate professor of education at the
University of Rochester and PhD at the Warner Graduate School of
Education and Human Development **11** (David and Joseph, " Contesting
global neoliberalism and creating alternative futures", Discourse:
Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education 32:2, May 2011, Routledge)

[Contesting neoliberalism necessitates that we situate neoliberal
policies within the larger neoliberal discourse promoting markets,
competition, individualism, and privatization]{.underline}. Analysing
education policies in the USA, whether the push for mayoral control in
Rochester, New York (see Duffy, 2010; Hedeen, 2010; Ramos, 2010), school
reform policies under Renaissance 2010 in Chicago, or Race to the Top
under the Obama administration, requires that we understand how reforms
such as using standardized testing are presented as efficient, neutral
responses to the problem of raising student achievement, rather than
examining the root causes of student failure, including lack of decent
paying jobs and health care, and under-funded schools. [Current policies
reinforce neoliberalism and leave the status quo intact.]{.underline}
Similarly, if we look at education in Sub-Saharan Africa, we must
situate schools within the hollowing out of the state, and the lack of
adequate funding for education and other social services such as health
care. For example, in Uganda, as in several other Sub-Saharan countries,
the global recession has contributed to drug shortages, making it
impossible to treat the growing number of AIDS patients (McNeil, 2010).
Yet, under more social democratic policies the state would play a larger
role in providing health care. Furthermore, education is increasingly
contested, as the plutocracy promotes education as a means of producing
productive, rather than critical, employees. Schools are more often
places where teachers and students learn what will be on the test rather
than seeking answers to questions that cry out for answers, such as how
to develop a healthy, sustainable environment or communities where
people are actually valued for who they are rather than what they
contribute to the economy. [Instead, we must ask what kinds of relations
do we want to nurture, what kinds of social relations, what kind of work
do we want to do, and what kinds of culture and technologies do we want
to create]{.underline}. These questions require that we rethink schools
so that teachers and students can engage in real questions for which the
answer will make a difference in the quality of our lives. [These
questions also require that we rethink our relationship to a specific
kind of 'free' marketplace that is not, in fact, inevitable. By
problematizing the idea of neoliberal marketization, we can begin to
construct new markets that actually value commonly held resources and
local communities.]{.underline}

#### the aff's justification of capitalism is founded in pointing to the evil of the alternative as a reason for the status quo which normalizes crisis and precludes imagining any world outside capitalism 

**Fisher 9** (Mark, cultural theorist and professor at Department of
Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths, University of London, *Capitalist
Realism*, chapter 1)

What is unique about the dystopia in Children of Men is that it is
specific to late capitalism. This isn\'t the familiar totalitarian
scenario routinely trotted out in cinematic dystopias (see, for example,
James McTeigue\'s 2005 Vfor Vendetta). In the P.D. James novel on which
the film is based, democracy is suspended and the country is ruled over
by a self-appointed Warden, but, wisely, the film downplays all this.
For all that we know, the authoritarian measures that are everywhere in
place could have been implemented within a political structure that
remains, notionally, democratic. **[The War on Terror has prepared us
for such a development: [the]{.mark} [normalization of crisis]{.mark}
[produces a situation in which the repealing of measures]{.mark}
[brought in to deal with]{.mark} an [emergency becomes
unimaginable]{.mark} (when will the war be over?)]{.underline}**
Watching Children of Men, we are inevitably reminded of the phrase
attributed to Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Žižek, that **[[it is easier to
imagine the end of the world than]{.mark} it is to imagine [the end of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [That slogan captures precisely what
I mean by [\'capitalist realism\']{.mark}: [the]{.mark} widespread
[sense]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [not only is capitalism the only viable
political and economic system, but also that it is]{.mark} now
[impossible]{.mark} even [to imagine]{.mark} [a]{.mark} coherent
[alternative to it]{.mark}.]{.underline} Once, dystopian films and
novels were exercises in such acts of imagination - the disasters they
depicted acting as narrative pretext for the emergence of different ways
of living. Not so in Children of Men. The world that it projects seems
more like an extrapolation or exacerbation of ours than an alternative
to it. In its world, as in ours, ultra-authoritarianism and Capital are
by no means incompatible: internment camps and franchise coffee bars
co-exist. In Children of Men, public space is abandoned, given over to
uncollected garbage and stalking animals (one especially resonant scene
takes place inside a derelict school, through which a deer runs).
Neoliberals, the capitalist realists par excellence, have celebrated the
destruction of public space but, contrary to their official hopes, there
is no withering away of the state in Children of Men, only a stripping
back of the state to its core military and police functions (I say
\'official hopes since neoliberalism surreptitiously relied on the state
even while it has ideologically excoriated it. This was made
spectacularly clear during the banking crisis of 2008, when, at the
invitation of neoliberal ideologues, the state rushed in to shore up the
banking system.)

[The catastrophe in Children of Men is neither waiting down the road,
nor has it already happened. Rather, it is being lived
through]{.underline}. **[[There is no punctual moment of
disaster]{.mark}; [the world]{.mark} doesn\'t end with a bang, it winks
out, [unravels]{.mark}, [gradually falls apart]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[[What caused the catastrophe to occur]{.mark}, who knows; its cause
[lies long in the past]{.mark}, so absolutely [detached from the
present]{.mark} as to seem like the caprice of a malign being: a
negative miracle, a malediction which no penitence can ameliorate.
**[Such a blight can only be eased by an intervention that can no more
be anticipated than was the onset of the curse]{.mark} in the first
place**]{.underline}. Action is pointless; only senseless hope makes
sense. Superstition and religion, the first resorts of the helpless,
proliferate.

But what of the catastrophe itself? It is evident that the theme of
sterility must be read metaphorically, as the displacement of another
kind of anxiety. I want to argue this anxiety cries out to be read in
cultural terms, and the question the film poses is: how long can a
culture persist without the new? What happens if the young are no longer
capable of producing surprises?

Children of Men connects with the suspicion that the end has already
come, the thought that it could well be the case that the future harbors
only reiteration and re-permutation. Could it be that there are no
breaks, no \'shocks of the new\' to come? Such anxieties tend to result
in a bi-polar oscillation: the \'weak messianic\' hope that there must
be something new on the way lapses into the morose conviction that
nothing new can ever happen. The focus shifts from the Next Big Thing to
the last big thing - how long ago did it happen and just how big was it?

T.S. Eliot looms in the background of Children of Men, which, after all,
inherits the theme of sterility from The Waste Land. The film\'s closing
epigraph \'shantih shantih shantih\' has more to do with Eliot\'s
fragmentary pieces than the Upanishads\' peace. Perhaps it is possible
to see the concerns of another Eliot - the Eliot of \'Tradition and the
Individual Talent\' - ciphered in Children of Men. It was in this essay
that Eliot, in anticipation of Harold Bloom, described the reciprocal
relationship between the canonical and the new. The new defines itself
in response to what is already established; at the same time, the
established has to reconfigure itself in response to the new. Eliot\'s
claim was that the exhaustion of the future does not even leave us with
the past. Tradition counts for nothing when it is no longer contested
and modified. A culture that is merely preserved is no culture at all.
The fate of Picasso\'s Guernica in the film - once a howl of anguish and
outrage against Fascist atrocities, now a wall-hanging - is exemplary.
Like its Battersea hanging space in the film, the painting is accorded
\'iconic\' status only when it is deprived of any possible function or
context. No cultural object can retain its power when there are no
longer new eyes to see it.

We do not need to wait for Children of Men\'s near-future to arrive to
see this transformation of culture into museum pieces. [[The power of
capitalist realism derives]{.mark} in part [from the way]{.mark} that
[capitalism subsumes]{.mark} and consumes [all of previous
history]{.mark}: one effect of its \'system of equivalence\' which can
assign all cultural objects, whether they are religious iconography,
pornography, or Das Kapital, a monetary value]{.underline}. Walk around
the British Museum, where you see objects torn from their lifeworlds and
assembled as if on the deck of some Predator spacecraft, and you have a
powerful image of this process at work. [In the conversion of practices
and rituals into merely aesthetic objects, the beliefs of previous
cultures are objectively ironized, transformed into artifacts.
[Capitalist realism is]{.mark} therefore not a particular type of
realism; it is more like [realism in itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
Marx and Engels themselves observed in The Communist Manifesto,

\[Capital\] has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor,
of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water
of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange
value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms,
has set up that single, unconscionable freedom --- Free Trade. In one
word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it
has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

[Capitalism is what is left when beliefs have collapsed at the level of
ritual or symbolic elaboration, and all that is left is the
consumer-spectator, trudging through the ruins and the relics. Yet this
turn from belief to aesthetics, from engagement to spectatorship, is
held to be one of the virtues of capitalist realism]{.underline}. In
claiming, as Badiou puts it, to have \'delivered us from the \"fatal
abstractions\" inspired by the \"ideologies of the past\'[\",
[capitalist realism presents itself as a shield protecting us
from]{.mark} the [peril]{.mark}s posed by belief itself.]{.underline}
The attitude of ironic distance proper to postmodern capitalism is
supposed to immunize us against the seductions of fanaticism. [[Lowering
our expectations, we are told, is a small price to pay for being
protected]{.mark} from terror and totalitarianism]{.underline}. \'We
live in a contradiction,\' Badiou has observed:

a brutal state of affairs, profoundly inegalitarian - where all
existence is evaluated in terms of money alone - is presented to us as
ideal. [[To justify their conservatism]{.mark}, the [partisans]{.mark}
of the established order cannot really call it ideal or wonderful. So
instead, they have decided to [say that]{.mark} all [the rest is
horrible]{.mark}. Sure, they say, [we may not live in]{.mark} a
condition of [perfect Goodness]{.mark}. [But we\'re lucky that we don\'t
live in]{.mark} a condition of [Evil]{.mark}. Our [democracy is not
perfect]{.mark}. [But it\'s better than]{.mark} the bloody
[dictatorships]{.mark}. [Capitalism is unjust]{.mark}. [But
it\'s]{.mark} [not]{.mark} criminal like [Stalinism]{.mark}. We let
millions of Africans die of AIDS, but we don\'t make racist nationalist
declarations like Milosevic. [We kill Iraqis with]{.mark} our
[airplanes]{.mark}, [but we don\'t cut their throats]{.mark} with
machetes like they do in Rwanda,]{.underline} etc.

[The [\'realism\']{.mark} here [is analogous]{.mark} [to the]{.mark}
deflationary perspective of a [depressive]{.mark} [who believes that any
positive state]{.mark}, any hope, [is a dangerous
illusion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[On Quality of Life:]{.underline} [Strong orientation to pleasure

democracy to other forms of government, half would give priority to 'a

[majorities are concerned about the weak]{.underline} (children,

laziness]{.underline} and lack of willpower, [while majorities elsewhere
stress instead lack of fair opportunities as the main
cause]{.underline}. Despite this division, large majorities everywhere
were reportedly willing to pay 1% more of their income as taxes to help
the world's poor; vastly more than nearly all governments actually give.
Next, tolerance of other groups is supported in the abstract, but a

these areas is how to bridge the attitude--behaviour gap. But

statespeople and lawyers who wrote the major h]{.underline}uman
[r]{.underline}ights [documents and who work to enforce them in the
international legal arena]{.underline}. For the most part, [ordinary
people appear as passive victims]{.underline}, or not at all, in the
standard interpretation. As Ronald Meister argues, the "new paradigm of
human rights activism . . . now consists of rescuing those who suffer"
(Meister 2012, 20). **[The h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights
**[brigades descending from the Global North to save the "victims" of
the Global South thus override the collective political power and agency
of those people, treating them as objects of Global North benevolence
even as they pontificate about human dignity.]{.underline}** But as Bas
de Gaay Fortman reminds us, [for those suffering under the "gross
injustices in the formation, distribution, and use of economic and
political power," h]{.underline}uman [r]{.underline}ights [are not "a
mere moral discourse" but the basis for their own struggles against the
dynamics and structures of power that cause and perpetuate the
injustice]{.underline} (De Gaay Fortmann 2011, 201). In practice, from
below, as organizing principles of democratic struggles against
colonialism, its lingering effects, and the class structure of
capitalism, human rights cannot be collapsed into justifications for
liberal capitalism, as mainstream economists like Chauffour thought
(Reddy 2012, 63--72). Rather, **[when used as principles to legitimate
democratic mobilizations from below, human rights are "hinge
principles]{.underline}**." That is, **[they provide already accepted
legitimations for transformational struggles whose success would
ultimately lead to a society in which capitalist class structure,
patriarchy, the racist legacies of colonialism and slavery, and the
reified power of market forces over human life-interests would be
overcome]{.underline}**. To fully substantiate my contention that the
standard interpretation of human rights is not the only possible
interpretation, and that, as a consequence, the critique of the standard
interpretation of human rights does not prove the argument that there is
no transformative value to human rights at all, I would have to work
through each of the core human rights documents. That is:
**[the]{.underline}** Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(**[UD]{.underline}**), **[the]{.underline}** Covenant on Political and
Civil Rights (**[PC]{.underline}**), **[the]{.underline}** Covenant on
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (**[ES]{.underline}**),
**[the]{.underline}** Draft Declaration on the Right to Development
(**[RD]{.underline}**), **[the]{.underline}** Convention on the Rights
of the Child (**[RC]{.underline}**), the Draft Declaration on
**[the]{.underline}** Rights of Indigenous People
(**[IP]{.underline}**), **[the]{.underline}** Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women
(**[EW]{.underline}**), **[the]{.underline}** Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
(**[FRD]{.underline}**), **[the]{.underline}** Convention on the Rights
of Persons With Disabilities (**[PD]{.underline}**), **[and
the]{.underline}** Draft Declaration on Principle of Human Rights and
the Environment (**[DE]{.underline}**).1 [Since I cannot provide a
comprehensive commentary on each of these documents, I will have to
content myself with making a partial case]{.underline}, which [focuses
on two core human rights: the right to life and the right to
self-determination]{.underline}. The first is asserted in Article 3 of
the UD and the second in the IP. [The most basic h]{.underline}uman
[r]{.underline}ight [is the right to life]{.underline} itself. In the
classical liberal thought from which it derives, the right to life is
typically understood as the right to not be deprived of life by the
arbitrary decisions of state power. However, if we recall the wider
philosophical context of its early assertion in Locke's Second Treatise
of Government, its deeper life-value becomes apparent. [For Locke, the
exercise of natural rights is constrained by the superior moral power of
natural law, which commands all people to preserve life]{.underline}.
[In practice this command entails that people ensure that there are
sufficient resources for all; that they do not appropriate more than
they can use and leave "enough and as good for others]{.underline}"
(Locke 1980, 21). [Locke believed (wrongly) that with the introduction
of money the problem of scarcity would be resolved]{.underline}, but he
never asserts anywhere that the demands that natural law imposes on
accumulation can be held in abeyance. We can drop Locke's mistaken
belief that money (economic efficiency) solves the problem of scarcity,
and also the idea of a natural law grounded in divine command. **[That
which remains is the moral-political core of the life-value of the right
to life. The right to life thus understood is a secure claim, to the
goods, relationships, resources, and institutional mechanisms that all
require because we are natural-social beings with non-optional,
nonvoluntary needs]{.underline}**. [Thought through in terms of what
"life" requires, the right to life is not merely a protection against
arbitrary state power, but is a complex "right to live]{.underline}."
The right to live is thus a right to the means of life: "the right to
live a dignified life; the right to a quality of life; the right to a
life free of fear of hunger and destitution; a life where the human
spirit has space to flourish" (Baruchello and Johnstone 2011, 94). This
right is asserted in Article 3 of the UD, but [its concrete reality, as
the right to access the resources, relationships, and institutions
required to live a fully human life, depends upon the satisfaction of
h]{.underline}uman [r]{.underline}ights [covering both natural and
social human life-requirements, all of which are spelled out in various
places in the full set of human rights documents]{.underline}. As hinge
principles, human rights are unified by the demand that they cohere with
the right to life by ensuring satisfaction of one or another need
instrumental to ensuring the satisfaction of the natural and social
conditions for free, flourishing, and meaningful lives for each and all.
[Human beings are integral bio-social beings, social self-conscious
agents who depend upon the bio-sphere and each other in order to
live]{.underline}. Our freedom and our good are also integrally
bio-social. Our freedom, our capacity to act as social self-conscious
agents, depends upon our imaginative, creative, and world-building
capacities, which derive ultimately from our evolutionary history. [The
shaping of these capacities into concrete human life-activities and
goals, on the other hand, derives from our social, political, economic,
and cultural histories.]{.underline} We cannot live freely if our bodies
are damaged by ill health or unnecessarily early death; our creative
capacities cannot be cultivated if we live in brutal authoritarian
circumstances, are deprived of education, or are forced into
unemployment or drudge work by labour markets unresponsive to our need
for meaningful activity. [The right to life, understood as the right to
the total set of basic natural and social life-requirements, grows up
out of the ground of the life-sustaining natural environment, but must
equally embrace the social-institutional requirements of free,
democratic life, because only in free democratic societies can the
life-capacities of each and all flourish, separately and
together]{.underline}. Clearly, I cannot provide an institutional sketch
of what a fully free democratic society that respected the right to life
as the right to the means of life would look like (not least of all
because there is no uniform template since democratic struggles always
follow the contours of specific histories). We do know what societies
that do not respect it look like: the ones that we live in right now,
which allow people to go without even the most basic lifenecessities,
which limit democracy to superficial legal forms without the substance
(the real power to public life through popular decision making power);
that remain patriarchal and racist despite hundreds of years of struggle
by women, racially subaltern groups, and their allies, and which
continue to despoil the environment and alienate our creative capacities
because they subordinate the value of human life-activity to the
profitable investment of money-capital. [Struggles against these
structural problems are all struggles for the natural and social
conditions of human life-flourishing, but they are equally struggles
against the standard interpretation of the right to life, which limits
it to protections against state power and mild re-distributive programs
that leave class structure intact]{.underline}. At the same time, the
right to life as the right to the means of life has one foot in the soil
of the classical liberal interpretation (Locke's conception of natural
law). Hence, [it is a hinge principle with some basis in existing
political theory and practice but unrealizable without fundamental
social changes]{.underline}. When I say that the right to life is a
hinge principle I do not mean that its mere assertion in some possible
revised version of the UD would suffice to solve the problems of global
capitalism. If that were my intention, a critic could reasonably rejoin
that my solution simply repeats the mistakes of that which I am
criticizing in the standard interpretation of human rights. However, I
do not mean that a different set of rights set out in different UN
documents can control the market forces that undermine peoples' right to
life. Rather, **[what I mean is that, given the wide-spread legitimacy
of h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights **[language, and the
real possibility of finding in the already existing documents moral and
political content that cannot be realized under existing forms of
political and economic power, the lifevalue interpretation of human
rights can legitimate mass democratic struggles against global
capitalism.]{.underline}** Read as hinge principles, my
re-interpretation of human rights is meant to solve the problem of
legitimacy of radical struggles; it does not substitute for them. That
is, it says to proponents of human rights: **[if you accept the moral
and political content of these documents, you have to also accept that
they de-legitimate global capitalism, and instead point us to a world
yet to be realized in which the natural and social conditions are fully
satisfied, not as a matter of abstract right, but daily social
reality]{.underline}**. The democratic implications of the right to life
as the right to the means of life are analogously implicit in the right
to self-determination. Unlike the right to life, **[the historical soil
of the right to self-determination is not found in classical liberalism,
but in the history of anti-colonial struggle.]{.underline}** It is not
found in the three core human rights documents (the UD, the PC and the
ES), but in the IP. Article 3 states that "Indigenous peoples have the
right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely
determine their political status and freely pursue their economic,
social and cultural development." The right is asserted in a Draft
Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People, because they have been
most violently denied that right by colonial power. They demand the
right that hegemonic powers have always enjoyed. However, [since the
rights of indigenous people are consonant with all other
h]{.underline}uman [r]{.underline}ights, [it must be the case that the
right to self-determination is not an exclusively indigenous right and
power, but a universal h]{.underline}uman [r]{.underline}ight [and power
that has been denied to indigenous people in particular.]{.underline}
Self-determination is a human capacity and potentiality; colonialism has
undermined it for indigenous people. However, the solution is democratic
societies in which the conditions of self-determination are secured for
all groups, not only, as at present, ruling classes. If we think it
through, [the right to self-determination cannot be coherently realized
in social conditions characterized by fundamental differences of class,
sex, and racial power.]{.underline} Where a ruling class, anchored in
private and exclusive control over universally required life resources
and shaped by sex and racial differences that augment their power,
controls society, universally coherent self-determination will be
impossible. **[Since ruling classes depend upon exploiting labour, their
life-activity will always impede subaltern groups from freely
determining their lives]{.underline}**. **[The right to
self-determination is clear about the scope of the right: it must be
exercised in the political, economic, social, and cultural spheres of
life]{.underline}** (all of which presuppose that the natural conditions
of biological life are safe from environmental degradation). Clearly,
the coherent realization of a right to self-determination across these
spheres is incompatible with: exploitation, alienation, poverty,
structural unemployment, authoritarianism, racism, sexism, and
world-destructive capitalist growth dynamics. **[Where labour is
exploited, workers cannot determine their lives; where sexual difference
confers unequal power, the sexually subaltern cannot determine their
lives; where racial difference confers unequal power, the racially
subaltern cannot determine their lives, and so on]{.underline}**. If we
think the right to life as the right to the total set of means of life
together with the right to self-determination, a clear normative picture
emerges. The realization of these accepted human rights would require
fundamental changes to existing relationships between human productive
activity and the natural environment, social structures (class, sex, and
race relationships), economic dynamics (the pursuit of profitable
returns over the health and freedom of human life-activity), political
systems (merely formal democratic institutions that lack real democratic
substance) and depth motivations and dispositions (egocentric greed and
winner take all competitive attitudes). **[When h]{.underline}**uman
**[r]{.underline}**ights **[principles are the legitimating ground of
struggles against the private appropriation of nature for profitable
exploitation, or the exploitation of labour, or the legacies of
colonialism, or violence against women; when they are mobilized in
struggle for democratic control over workplaces and public policy; for
peaceful and egalitarian relationships between nations and cultures; for
women's liberation, these principles demand far more than the standard
interpretation asks for and far more than liberal-capitalist society can
give.]{.underline}** **[At its most radical, all that the standard
interpretation demands is a cosmopolitan social
democracy]{.underline}**. That would be an improvement over neo-liberal
austerity and neoimperialism, but even in its most robust forms in the
1960s social democracy failed to do more than attenuate poverty,
exploitation, alienation, racism, and sexism. **[Either we conclude that
attenuation is the best we can hope for, or we continue the struggle and
seek new and creative means of institutionalizing the right to life as
the right to means of life and the right to self-determination as
comprehensive and coherent democratic control over political, economic,
and social life.]{.underline}** Of course, my argument is vulnerable to
the objection that it leaves the precise means of struggle and the
precise structure of institutions open. Despite this limitation, I
believe that it has exposed the difference between human rights
understood as extensions of classical liberal legal forms, and human
rights as substantive life-values. Thought through from their real
life-value foundation, [h]{.underline}uman [r]{.underline}ights [as
hinge principles point towards a future which has overcome the
structural problems which destroy so many lives today]{.underline}. If
we want a society that is consistent with the implications of human
rights as principles of life-security and development, then we in effect
agree that it must be a society which has overcome the core threats to
life's security and development. **[Those core threats are: the private
ownership of universally required life-resources and their exploitation
for money-profit; the capture of democratic institutions by economic
elites; the use of military violence to secure the global domination of
those elites; the on-going domination of subaltern sexual and racial
identities; and the bending of all human purposes and capacities to
service for money-value creation. If the world really acted on these
hinge principles, it would open the door towards a democratic life
economy whose primary goal would be the universal and comprehensive
satisfaction of fundamental human life requirements.]{.underline}**

[A queer marxist-feminist perspective provides us with ways of
envisioning a queer anti-capitalism]{.underline}. Many people who engage
in same-sex sexual practices have won neither full citizenship nor a
place within the currently existing queer public spaces. The brutalizing
experiences of many queer youth (or youth perceived as queer) in high
schools is an important reminder of how far we have to go to achieve
full human rights (see Frank, 1994; Smith, 1998[). A new queer radical
agenda will have to be built around the needs, desires and organizing
capacities of the young, the poor, people of color, women, transgendered
people, working-class people, people living with AIDS and/or
disabilities, the elderly and those who cannot or will not come
out]{.underline}. One of the important organizing bases for this agenda
will be the emerging movement of queer trade unionists, though (like the
unions themselves[) it will need to go much farther to organize the
unorganize]{.underline}d (people in non-union workplaces, contingent
workers, people who are not employed) [and the excluded]{.underline} (on
the basis of nationality, racialization, disability or gender). [A queer
anti-capitalism takes us back to the best of the liberationist politics
that emerged after Stonewall: the militancy, the breadth of vision and
the transformative commitments]{.underline}. An engaged queer marxist
feminism provides valuable tools for negotiating the complex issues that
led to the impasse of gay libertarianism and lesbian feminism,
specifically through grounding the analysis of sexuality in a rich
understanding of processes of social reproduction. [It is possible to
combine a joyous struggle for sexual freedom with a serious and nuanced
examination of the power relations that shape our experiences of gender
and sexuality]{.underline}

### Alt -- Rewrite Neolib

Industrialist and philanthropist, lobbyist and cultural leader: [Samuel
Galton Jr. was in 1795 a prominent member of Birmingham's
bourgeoisie]{.underline}. [He was also a pacifist]{.underline} Quaker,
from a family that had long been prominent in the Society of Friends,
and likely the leading gun manufacturer for Britain's massive war
machine. [In 1795 the Society of Friends Meeting in Birmingham finally
called Galton's gun manufacturing into question and ultimately expelled
him]{.underline}. But Galton rejected the arguments of his inquisitors.
[He defended himself by insisting that it was arbitrary to single out a
weapons manufacturer]{.underline}. **[All merchants and industrialists,
he suggested, fed the enormous appetite of the British war-making
state.]{.underline}** Bankers and merchants floated loans, and British
capital markets grew primarily to finance the ceaseless wars of the 18th
century. **[Not just gun makers but also iron, leather, textile, and
food manufacturers all grew and profited through lucrative, large-scale
contracting with the war-making state. The whole economy was a war
economy]{.underline}**, Galton concluded, and it was arbitrary to
narrowly condemn his business. Galton's defense of his pacifist faith
and bellicose occupation is the hook for Priya Satia's Empire of Guns.
From local Quaker mercantile and financial networks in Birmingham to
global demand for guns and gun making in Britain's empire, [we see the
origins of capitalism soaked in the bloody circuits of the gun trade and
warfare]{.underline}. [The war-making state of the 18th century provided
industrialists with a unique kind of demand. It purchased food,
uniforms, weapons, and other supplies on a scale that made mass
production attractive and necessary.]{.underline} Empire of Guns offers
a history of the 18th-century economy that validates Galton's belief
that military contracting and demand permeated virtually every aspect of
production, exchange, and finance. **[This history of guns underlines a
deeper affinity among the state, violence, and
capitalism]{.underline}**. [The rise of capitalism was marked not by the
retreat of a rule-bound liberal state but by the expansion of a massive
fiscal and military apparatus that extracted revenue, swept up
production, shaped demand, and projected power across
empires.]{.underline} Satia offers an account of the flows of resources
and influences that stitched together guns, empire, and industrial
capitalism. Eighteenth-century Britain was a "military-industrial
society," built out of diffuse and overlapping networks among
arms-making contractors, the Board of Ordnance, and imperial chartered
companies such as the East India Company[. The line between public and
private, government work and private enterprise was not yet formalized
in this world of gentlemen's agreements. Satia's networked conception of
a military-industrial society contrasts with the formalized,
concentrated, and bureaucratic apparatus of the military-industrial
complex of the 20th century]{.underline}. In both, the state was
central, but the networks of trust, credit, and finance of the 18th
century were very different from the integrated research bureaucracies
that bridged the academy, the military, and Fordist firms in the 20th.
[This entangled network of relationships among the Board of Ordnance,
arms-making contractors, and semi-state, semi-corporate chartered
companies]{.underline} (foremost the East India Company) [channeled
flows of resources into the gun-making industry, and, for Satia, created
a structure of demand that was central to the industrial revolution
itself]{.underline}. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, although the
specific processes of gun making remained in the hands of artisanal
ironworkers, government officials commanded proofhouses and planned gun
production, so that the state ran "a kind of virtual factory: a highly
subdivided and efficient system of mass production, but too inclusive to
house under a single roof." Satia makes a compelling case that "[state
institutions drove Britain's industrial revolution," and she highlights
the centrality of empire in British state capacity.]{.underline} [The
East India Company, a major purchaser of arms, provided crucial guidance
on weapon designs that "an expanded and reorganized military-industrial
society could produce in mass quantities on a new order of
magnitude]{.underline}." [The company also stifled arms manufacture in
its colonial territory, despite expert inspectors finding the guns made
in India to be superior in some cases.]{.underline} East India Company
demand for weapons from England was critical in driving gun-making
innovation, while at the same time the company carefully reoriented
Indian economic development to serve the colonizers' interests. Thus
**[it was the state, and its semi-state imperial vanguard, the East
India Company, that brought "revolution ... to the gun
industry]{.underline}**." State-led experiments with machinery,
coordination through a contractors' cartel, new apprenticeship
regulations, and bounties transformed the "internal structures of the
artisanal system so that it could produce on a mass scale," boosting
production from 3,000 guns per week in 1790 to 14,000 per week after
1803. Deeply rooted in the archives of the mercantile families of
Birmingham, the craft workshops of the gun trade, and the intricacies of
the imperial state's contracting system, Empire of Guns offers a
sweeping revision of the history of the origins of the industrial
revolution and the nature of capitalism itself. [Satia forces us to
reconsider some of our foundational assumptions about political economy.
Much like Sven Beckert's Empire of Cotton, Satia's Empire of Guns puts
state power and violence at the center of the emergence and growth of
capitalism]{.underline}. Her account shares important interpretative
terrain with Beckert's book, which argued [for "war capitalism"---a
historically specific conjuncture of state power, merchants, and
violence as the foundation for the first industrial revolution, in
cotton textiles]{.underline}. This move to center state power marks a
departure in recent histories of capitalism. Certainly, outstanding
recent work on securities, public debt, and financial risk has been
closely attuned to politics and public policy. In addition, since Peter
Evans, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, and Theda Skocpol issued their call to
"bring the state back in," many [scholars in the fields of American
political development, legal history, and political economy have focused
on the role of public policy in constituting, shaping, and directing
capitalism. But if this work has successfully chipped away at the
liberal core underpinning most conceptions of political
economy]{.underline} (even Marxist ones), [a liberal pillar still stands
that sees politics and state power as reacting to and regulating the
primary drivers of the capitalist economy]{.underline}. [Satia pushes us
toward a more radical recasting of our understanding of the state in the
history of capitalism]{.underline}. What if we need to flip the script?
What if expansive state power should come first in our understanding of
what is distinctive about capitalism? Satia suggests that [it was
uniquely powerful states with extensive infrastructural, fiscal, and
war-making capacity that created the foundation for modern
capitalism]{.underline}. Indeed, it seems that compared to all other
political economies throughout history, capitalist political economies
have been uniquely characterized by ever more powerful states. A sign of
an enduring liberal dichotomy of state and economy is a preoccupation
with regulation (state vs. markets) as a measure of state capacity.
Satia's work stresses [instead the flows of resources that integrate the
state into the heart of the political economy through extraction
(taxation) and, in Empire of Guns, allocation (spending]{.underline}).
**[Because governments require resources to make war, purchase guns,
and, after the 18th century, finance infrastructure, fund schools,
provide social insurance, and incarcerate the poor, the share of the
economy that governments capture through taxation is an essential
indicator of the scale of state capacity over time.]{.underline}**
Fiscal history is decidedly unsexy, but taxes, budgets, and spending are
the sinews of state power. And taxes just keep going up. During the
imperial climacteric at the end of the 18th century, Britain, as one of
the most successful fiscal-military states in Europe, was able to
extract 10 to 15 percent of GDP in taxation, tripling the single-digit
rates for early modern states and more than doubling the state capacity
of the Roman Empire at its height.1 [Despite Third Way pronouncements
from centrist politicians like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair that the "era
of big government is over," governments have never been
larger]{.underline}. From 1965 to 2015, the OECD average for total
taxation as a percentage of GDP rose from 25 percent to nearly 35
percent. [Thatcher and Reagan prevailed on the terrain of ideology but
failed to slow the growth of the state. In an era of neoliberal
political hegemony, it's not surprising that the durable growth of state
power across the history of capitalism has been largely
invisible]{.underline}. From guns in the 18th century to pensions and
prisons in the 21st century, the state has continued to expand. Ignored
by most but a small niche of econometricians, this durable trajectory
carries the tag "Wagner's Law," named after the German economist who
first observed the statist tendency of capitalism in the late 19th
century. [Liberalism has been a powerful political project for
capitalist elites, providing a universalistic language with which to
first denounce aristocratic privilege and later reject the
redistributive claims of working-class parties. But liberal conceptions
of political economy have never offered an accurate guide to
understanding the movements of capitalism itself]{.underline}. Satia
might have helped her account by not overstating the novelty of her
approach. [While it may be that "the myth of pacific British
industrialism" still dominates many textbooks, it is not quite fair to
introduce the project by claiming that "no one has explained how
constant war impinged on the grand economic narrative of the time, the
industrial revolution."]{.underline} Charles Tilly, for instance,
devoted much of his prolific scholarship to the intertwined development
of states, war making, and modern capitalism. Researchers across the
social sciences continue to engage with and expand on Tilly's
"bellicist" tradition of historical sociology. Within the field of
British and global economic history, Patrick K. O'Brien has also written
extensively on how **[British empire and war making proved crucial for
driving forward the industrial revolution]{.underline}**. Nevertheless,
Satia's work does mark a new moment of clarity in a long tradition.
**[Empire of Guns calls on us to recast our understanding of capitalist
political economies, foregrounding the violent and state-led origins of
capitalism]{.underline}**. **[Satia urges us to put the "political" back
into "political economy," with a full view of the imperial, coercive,
coordinating, and contracting capacity of the state]{.underline}**. But
there is also need for caution and reflection. [Economic historians have
approached recent histories of capitalism with considerable
skepticism]{.underline}.2 A rapprochement between the rigidly
quantitative approaches of economic history and the more
institutionalist, cultural, and political approach of historians might
be welcome, but Satia closes the door on such an engagement at the
outset, stating that any "quantitative assessment of the state's role in
the industrial revolution is both methodologically impossible and
inappropriate." Even the best, most eclectic, and wide-ranging economic
historians have astonishingly thin conceptions of politics, cultural
power, and the social history of collective action. Historians, on the
other hand, have developed a debilitating refusal (and in many cases
inability) to engage with quantitative approaches and remain more
comfortable studying the policies and procedures of regulation. But if
we want to trace the historical development of fiscal flows through
taxation, budgets, and spending, quantitative assessment of the scope
and scale of these tides, not just narrative descriptions of their
embankments, seems essential. [Engaging with quantitative arguments and
approaches does not necessarily mean getting trapped in the flattening
assumptions of liberalism and methodological individualism]{.underline}.
**[To rewrite the history of capitalism with state power at the center,
cultural, institutional, and quantitative approaches will all be
necessary. Quantification seems essential if we aim to study the state
not simply as an apparatus of regulation but as a coercive site for the
extraction and allocation of resources, whether that spending is on
guns, canals, pensions, or prisons]{.underline}**. Classical liberalism
and its 20th-century rebirth in functionalist modernization theory have
provided the central pillar around which even critical political
economies have circled. Satia shows us an opening toward rebuilding the
study of capitalism as political economy. Reconstructing the
relationships and flows of resources that tied the Birmingham gun
district to the imperial state, she situates Britain's war capitalism
within an 18th-century "military-industrial society" that transcended
entrenched boundaries between nation and empire, firms and bureaucrats,
and economy and state. **[To confront capitalism today, to reckon with
its potential and limits, we must also fundamentally confront the state
in its full coercive, extractive, and (potentially) redistributive
capacity]{.underline}**. From the 18th century to the present,
ever-expanding state power has never been exterior or ancillary, but
constitutive of capitalist political economy itself.

Departments of international relations should be the inevitable homes of
those who think that we cannot understand the social world without an
understanding of global processes. [Those who seek to understand the
dynamics of global social change]{.underline}, inequalities between the
many parts of the world, social injustices and the potential for
progressive social change [have often found that a global perspective is
needed]{.underline}. The message in this work has been that [these
processes need to be understood in a world historical social
context]{.underline}. In approaching the contribution of historical
materialism to contemporary international debates, my starting point was
therefore one of dual critique. We cannot take the categories of
international relations as givens, searching for instance for more
materialist explanations of traditional international realities. This is
not to deny the importance of grasping the continuities, in accounting
for the present, it is however, to argue that [we acknowledge the
radical disjuncture's of the present]{.underline}, that [we investigate
the nature of the contemporary historical change and make the evaluation
of its significance a central historical tas]{.underline}k. By the same
token however, we cannot simply take over the given tradition of Marxism
as the basis for contemporary global understanding. **[Historical
materialism has greatly enriched our grasp of the international
processes]{.underline}** but most important work has been located in a
period in which the national-international realms were first entrenched,
thus not in the present in which that duality is being transformed.
Marxists and indeed other approaches will have contributions to make.
Marx's central contribution to critical historicist thought is the
principle of historical specificity.84 My argument for example has been
that [the value of Marx's approach is enhanced if we understand it in
ways more complex]{.underline} than his own, [periodising in terms of
political, as well as production relations]{.underline} for instance.
The emancipatory thrust of Marx's social theory too, remains a powerful
impetus. Similarly the idea that social groups may become collective
actors in their own emancipation is a fundamental insight even if the
contribution of the social movements is now partially de-linked from the
role of the working class. It is true that the most fruitful
contributions to critical thought have come in recent decades from
writers, as mentioned in this work, whose main reference point have been
other than Marx. These contributions have incorporated however some of
these insight of Marx even as they have transcended a Marxist
position.85 The lessons of Marx that i have instanced may be useful
correctives to any tendency towards transhistorical categories or
generalisations, towards abstract structuralism, or towards neglect of
the emancipatory questions which are central to understanding
contemporary world changes. In the first part of this work, therefore,
our discussion has been directed to concerns how and why mainstream IR
has been reconstructed since the start of the Cold War along ahistorical
and asociological lines, given the interdisciplinary in the field of the
international before the first department of IR was established in 1919.
To the extent that [contemporary mainstream theorists have made use of
history, they have employed an instrumentalist view of it and not as a
means of rethinking the present but rather in order to confirm theories
of the present]{.underline}.86 By contrast [our argument is for the
employment of a constitutive reading of history]{.underline}, meaning
not merely an examination of history for its own sake or just so we can
delve into the past, nor basically as a means of confirming
theorisations of the present, but rather [for the purposes of rethinking
theories and problematise present views and ideas, so a reconfiguration
of the IR research agenda can be met.]{.underline} Neglecting or
bypassing history is not only a cause of injustice to the history of the
international system but it also leads to a misinterpretation of the
present.[87 Our task therefore was to reveal the **illusions of
ahistoricism** that have duped us for too long]{.underline}.
**[Reintroducing historical materialist enquiry is thus necessary to
bring into focus continuity]{.underline}**, discontinuity and
contingency that actually constitutes past and present international
debates[. The extreme claim that Marxism and IR are
incompatible]{.underline}, no less than the extreme claim that
international history and IR are incompatible,88 [is usually justified
on epistemologically bogus ground.]{.underline} It is bogus because
historians always implicitly make theoretically loaded assumptions about
the world based on their own experience in a particular time and space.
To acknowledge this should be the first task of the historian not just
of the IR theoriticians.89 [The ultimate connection between Marxism and
IR is the study of time and historical specificity]{.underline}. Social
relations do not exist apart from time and all life form is affected by
what has gone before thus for the understanding of the actual reality
one cannot ignore the past as a matter of choice.90 Accordingly, it must
be made very clear that we are not only reallocating an unproblematised
Marxist approach into the study of IR. Instead we have sought to
reformulate some lessons from historical materialism in order to
historicise IR; ironically, this leads to an approach that is no less
critical of conventional Marxism. This provides one of the most
compelling reasons why we believe the next generation of scholars should
engage in the project discussed in this work, if they are to enhance
their perspectives in IR and at the same time Marxism. [Our remedy for
the ahistorical illusions with which international relations are
understood within the mainstream, rests on the theme of a dialectical
process that constitutes international relations]{.underline}, [which is
intimately connected with re-conceiving international relations as
praxis]{.underline}. In outlining our preferred critical historical
materialist approach we have ultimately rejected vulgar materialism
which implies the traditional base/superstructure model outlined and
weightily theorised far beyond its limited capacity by a certain current
of Marxism. In turn because our prime objective is that of restoring the
role of international relations [by enhancing its research agenda to one
of giving voice to actors which harness potentially emancipatory and
liberating practices that do not simply reflect class imperatives but
also constitute the social relations of production, we have necessarily
sought to find a critical alternative to the traditional
base/superstructure]{.underline}. Hence, the solution was to go beyond
the approach of the French structuralist school and effectively
neutralise the distinction altogether, t[hereby in effect positing
international relations as constitutive of the base.]{.underline} An
overall conclusion to this work would be that [all versions
of]{.underline} critical theory generally and [**critical historical
materialism particularly are especially strong in their ability to
overcome** homo economicus reasoning and images of societies that are
atomistic, **by revealing the radical breaks between past and present,**
and in their ability to overcome the ahistorical and asociological
mainstream by denaturalising existing structures and institutions, and
thereby **revealing the present as an imminent order of change**.
Reconceptualising and re-theorising the sovereign state has been central
to the development of historical materialism of international
relations]{.underline}. [The conventional view of the state constituted
only by the competitive dynamics of the international
system]{.underline}, has been condemned as theoretically impoverished
and empirically unhelpful. [This understanding of the
state]{.underline}, which denies connections between the domestic and
the international and which attributes all casual significance to the
balance of military power between states, **[obscures the complex
interconnections between states and social forces]{.underline}**, the
mutually constitutive relationship between the domestic and the
international and the multiple factors that shape state structure and
interests. The challenge, I think for historical materialist proponents,
is to re-engage or reconceive the state and to problematise, not occlude
these complexities. This work suggests that such a reengagement is not a
novel undertaking but that [Marxism has provided a foundation for the
study of global relations]{.underline}, prior to and since the
establishment of the discipline in the early twentieth century,
particularly until the late 1980s and early 1990s. Our call for a
historicist turn in IR finds an echo in an analogous call made by
Hoffman in mid-twentieth century for a serious critique towards
approaches in pursuit for law-like understandings developed by the
behaviourist school.91 That such a critical mass should emerge at the
current time is not at all surprising. Our world is undergoing an
immense transformation, which cannot be understood with existing
theoretical means and insights needed for explaining the character of
the changes around us. **[An approach rooted in Marxist historicism can
provide an understanding of the global transformations that are taking
place]{.underline}**. This, indeed, has been the purpose of this work,
to lay out a critical historical approach in international relations on
the menu for choice; to assess the contribution of the sociological
understanding of global politics from historical materialism; to
evaluate the current work being undertaken by IR scholars that has an
historical and Marxist perspective; and to consider the future for such
an approach within the discipline. [Work done by Marxists provides a
rich framework for thinking about international politics]{.underline}
and the future for an historical materialist approach to the study of IR
is full of possibilities; even though this argument is not new, and nor
is Marxism to the study of IR. The argument has been that it was there
from the initiation of the discipline and has always remained part of
the study of the global processes, even if at times a somewhat
marginalised. I would argue that this work is, therefore not seeking a
radical reorienting of the discipline, but is suggesting a return to the
discipline's core commitment to multi-disciplinarity. In this way we are
not asking the discipline to deny its raison d'être but that it should
allow historical materialism back in.

#### The territorial logic pervasive in realist and imperialist theories fails to capture key aspects---only a Marxian IR approach avoids traditional flaws

During the 1990s, "globalization" emerged as the most convenient concept
to describe world affairs. During the 2000s, however, imperialism made
an impressive comeback in political and theoretical debates. Books like
David Harvey's (2003) New Imperialism, Ellen Meiksins Wood's (2003)
Empire of Capital, or Alex Callinicos's (2003) The New Mandarins of
American Power, to cite just a few, exemplified this tendency.
Similarly, the [notions of empire and imperialism became pertinent again
in mainstream discussions of international relations and
conflicts]{.underline}, exemplified in calls for a liberal imperialism
to deal with terrorism and rogue states (Cooper 2002; Wolf 2001) and for
the United States to act as a benevolent imperial hegemon to safeguard
Western values and liberties (Kagan 1998; Boot 2001; Donnelly 2002).
[This mostly had to do with the emergence of an aggressive American
military interventionism,]{.underline} beginning with the war in
Afghanistan, the brutal occupation of Iraq, and the plans for a military
strike against Iran. But however welcome it may be, [the return of the
concept of imperialism to political and theoretical debate]{.underline}
in the past decade and a half **[has, unfortunately, reproduced old
problems and controversies]{.underline}**. The identification of
imperialism with territorial expansion, the explanations of
international rivalries on the basis of the geopolitics of resources and
scarcity, [the tendency to define hierarchies in the international
system in terms of empire]{.underline} building[, and the recurring
**temptation of superimperialist theories all persist**.]{.underline} A
theoretical debate on imperialism is thus more than [necessary. In
constituting a **Marxian approach to the concept, we should ensure that
we do not limit ourselves to the theoretical premises of
realism**]{.underline} as it has been defined within mainstream
international relations theory. [While realism is seen as having merit
when contrasted with the idealist rhetoric]{.underline} of most current
globalization or cosmopolitan democracy theories, [the simplistic
Hobbesian conceptions of political power and great power
rivalry]{.underline} that are the backbone of realist theories of
international relations theory **[do not offer a possible way to
theorize either the complexity of determinations within the
international plane or the interrelation between economic, political,
and ideological antagonisms]{.underline}**.1 [Realism
remains]{.underline}, moreover, [a theoretical paradigm that leads to a
rather schematic territorial conception of the stakes in international
conflicts and antagonisms. Unfortunately, this territorial logic is also
echoed in many recent Marxist interventions.]{.underline} It is echoed,
in our opinion, in David Harvey's notion of an imperialism based on
accumulation by dispossession. For Harvey, capitalism not only induces a
logic of endless flows of capital but also brings forward the particular
importance of spatiotemporal fixes in a social process of production of
space that leads to the historical geography of imperialism. [This is
also the basis of a certain territorial logic used to ground the
tendency toward imperialism under capitalism]{.underline}. Here,
accumulation by dispossession acquires importance, especially in a
period of capitalist overaccumulation, in the sense of a predatory
imperialist quest for assets all over the world,2 in a form similar to
Rosa Luxemburg's (1951) insistence on capitalism's constant need for an
outside as a means to counter inherent crisis tendencies. That is why
Harvey (2003, 183) insists, "Imperialism of the capitalist sort arises
out of a dialectical relation between territorial and capitalistic
logics of power." In a similar vein, Alex Callinicos (2009, 83) has
insisted on the need to incorporate the state system and the conflicts
and antagonisms at that level as "a dimension of the capitalist mode of
production" leading to the combination of two forms of competition: one
among capitals and another geopolitical competition between states (see
Callinicos 2005, 2007, 2009). [But the problem]{.underline}, as Gonzalo
Pozo-Martin (2007) has shown, [is that **this "realist" or geopolitical
moment needs much more**]{.underline} 1. On realism (and neorealism) as
a theoretical tradition in international relations, see Carr (1939),
Wight (1994), Waltz (1979), and Frankel (1996). For a criticism of
traditional international relations theory see Rosenberg (1994). 2. "The
rise in importance of accumulation by dispossession as an answer
symbolized by the rise of an internationalist politics of neoliberalism
and privatization correlates with the visitation of periodic bouts of
predatory devaluation of assets in one part of the world or another.
[And this seems to be the heart of what contemporary imperialist
practice is about]{.underline}. The American bourgeoisie has, in short,
discovered what the British bourgeoisie discovered in the last three
decades of the nineteenth century, that, as Arendt has it, 'the original
sin of simple robbery' which made possible the original accumulation of
capital 'had eventually to be repeated lest the motor of accumulation
suddenly die down.' If this is so, then the 'new imperialism' appears as
nothing more than the revisiting of the old, though in a different place
and time" (Harvey 2003, 182). [theoretical elaboration if we want to
**avoid the theoretical shortcomings of traditional realist
conceptualizations of international relations.**]{.underline} A
territorial logic was also present in Peter Gowan's (1999) attempt
toward a Marxist geopolitics of American dominance, notwithstanding the
accuracy of many of his conclusions and despite his insistence that
American foreign policy is based on the promotion of American capitalist
interests as national interest. The alternatives to this conception of
imperialism have also not offered answers to these open questions. Leo
Panitch and Sam Gindin (2004) have offered many insights into the
articulation of modern imperialism and the hegemony of U.S. capitalism,
but they also show a certain underestimation of conflict and antagonism,
which brings their notion of an informal U.S. empire too close to a
classical superimperialist conception.3 Ellen Meiksins Wood's
writings---especially the Empire of Capital (Wood 2003[), despite being
one of the best theorizations of the difference between precapitalist
and capitalist imperialism]{.underline} and her insistence that fully
capitalist imperialism emerges mainly along with U.S. post--World War II
predominance in an international system comprised of sovereign
states---[tends to treat capitalism mainly in terms of capitalist
social-property relations (in the form of the "ideal type" of English
capitalism) and to underestimate the importance of the evolution of
modern state forms]{.underline}, especially in continental Europe. [It
is therefore important to **work further in the direction of theorizing
nonterritorial capitalist imperialism.** To this end, we begin with a
rereading of Lenin's writings on]{.underline} imperialism and their
continuing relevance. We then present arguments in favor of the
particular relevance, for the study of imperialism, of a Marxist
conception of the relative autonomy of the political and its specific
efficacy as a condensation of class strategies, as developed by Nicos
Poulantzas, along with stressing the importance of the Gramscian notion
of hegemony. Finally, we proceed to an [**alternative theorization of
the emergence of capitalist imperialism in order to substantiate our
argument for the specifically nonterritorial logic** of capitalist
imperialism.]{.underline}

#### Only a class-based understanding of social and economic power can explain international relations.

**Jessop 10** (Bob Jessop is Distinguished Professor of Sociology at
Lancaster University. He is best known for his contributions to state
theory, critical political economy (including the regulation approach),
welfare state restructuring, and his critical realist -- or scientific
realist -- account of structure and agency (the strategic-relational
approach). Recent publications include The Future of the Capitalist
State (2002), Beyond the Regulation Approach (2006, co-authored with

Rosenberg argues that '[any theory of **international relations** ...
needs to begin by grasping the historical uniqueness of both sovereignty
and anarchy as social forms **arising out of** the distinctive
configuration of social relations which Marx called the **capitalist
mode of production** and reproduction of social life']{.underline}
(1994: 172). Following the general historical materialist axiom that the
form of sovereignty, the relation between the politically dominant and
politically subordinate classes, generally reflects the specific
economic form in which surplus labour is appropriated (Marx, 1971: 791),
we can note that the typical form of the modern political association is
the classic 'Westphalian state' with mutually recognised formal
sovereignty within its territory. But this state form emerged only
stepwise over three centuries on the basis of pre-existing forms of
statehood (ranging from stateless societies to world-historical empires)
(Teschke, 2003), and few contemporary states match this model in formal,
let alone substantive, terms. [This makes it even more imperative to
**regard the state**]{.underline} (or, better, state power) [**in the
same way as capital**, i.e. as a social relation.]{.underline} [For,
like 'capital']{.underline} (or, better, capital accumulation), [the
state is 'a relationship of forces, or more precisely the material
condensation of such a **relationship among classes** and class
fractions]{.underline}, such as this is expressed within the State in a
necessarily specific form' (Poulantzas, 2001: 128--9, italics in
original). In other words, state power (not the state apparatus) is a
form-determined condensation of the changing balance of forces in
political and politically relevant struggle. It comprises an ensemble of
power centres and capacities that offer unequal chances to different
forces within and outside the state and that cannot, qua institutional
ensemble, exercise power. Its powers (always plural) are activated in
specific conjunctures through the agency of definite political forces,
which will usually attempt to take account of the prevailing and,
perhaps, future balance of forces within and beyond a given state. How
far and in what ways state powers (and any associated liabilities or
weak points) are actualised depends on the action, reaction and
interaction of specific social forces located within and beyond this
complex ensemble. As such the state is more accessible to some forces
than others according to the strategies they adopt to gain state power;
and it is more suited to the pursuit of some types of economic or
political strategy than others because of its typical modes of
intervention and resources. How significant is this differential impact
on political forces' capacity to pursue their interests will depend on
the nature of their goals, strategies and tactics and the changing sets
of constraints and opportunities within which these forces are located
(cf. Jessop, 1990, 2002, 2007a). [Whatever the actual standing of the
**Westphalian state system**, we can certainly observe the **coexistence
of a world market**, which is tendentially **unified and integrated**
through the **logic of profit-oriented**, **market-mediated
competition** based on the generalisation **of global trade and
\[capitalist\]** commodity **production**, and a world political system,
which remains characterised by a 'motley diversity' of states at
different scales that tend to coexist as hostile rivals, if not as
deadly enemies.]{.underline} Different authors see the survival of this
contrast as more or less advantageous or disadvantageous from a
capitalist viewpoint. Some highlight the capacity of individual capitals
to divide and rule states at different scales by forcing them to compete
to attract or retain investment under threat of capital flight and
disinvestment from their respective economic spaces (e.g. Arrighi, 1994;
Cowling and Tomlinson, 2005). [Others note the problem that such
particularistic **competition** may prevent national states from
**pursuing** the overall interests of **capital**, especially when this
leads to a counterproductive **race to the bottom** rather than pursuit
of the 'high road' to competitiveness]{.underline} (e.g. Messner, 1998;
Reinert, 2008). Yet others argue that the capitalist type of state may
have sufficient autonomy to override short-term pressures from
particular capitals to pursue these long-term interests -- even if the
resulting policies still favour some fractions of capital more than
others (e.g. Poulantzas, 1975; Gritsch, 2005). And yet others note that
the tension between the world market and the plurality of states can be
overcome through the emergence of a hegemonic state that articulates
economic, juridico-political, military and sociocultural strategies and
projects that advance its own long-term interests whilst securing the
short- to medium-term interests of subaltern states (e.g. van der Pijl,
1984; and, on Marx's position, see below). All four positions are
one-sided and their significance depends on how we approach the relation
between particular capitals and the overall logic of capital
accumulation, but taken together they highlight the site of real
problems in the articulation of the world market and the world political
system. An appropriate way to approach these different positions is
through the inherent contradictions, dilemmas and paradoxes of the
capital relation and its increasing dominance on a world scale. [Common
to these positions is the fact that the **interaction of world market
dynamics and state capacities** is shaped by the continued separation of
the profit-oriented, market-mediated dimension of accumulation from its
crucial extra-economic supports in the legal and political
system]{.underline} (among other institutional orders) [and,
notwithstanding this variable institutional separation, by the continued
reciprocal interdependence of 'market' and 'state' as **complementary
moments of the capital relation**. This is a **fundamental observation**
that should **inform critical scientific realist** work **in IR and
international political economy**. For]{.underline} the complex mutual
implications of world market dynamics and state power cannot be grasped
at the level of the actual because they are shaped by underlying
mechanisms. Two of the most important sets of such mechanisms comprise:
(1) [the inherent contradictions in the capital relation, especially
between use-value and exchange-value]{.underline}; and (2) [the typical
separation of the profit-oriented, marketmediated capitalist economy
from its crucial extra-economic preconditions. **States have key roles**
in mediating this relation, both directly and in seeking ways to defer
or displace problems generated by capital's inherent economic
contradictions and the separation of its economic and political
moments.]{.underline} The inherent contradictions in the capital
relation include: (a) [the contradiction between the **growing
socialisation** of productive forces through the deepening of the social
division of labour on a global scale **and the continuing private
ownership** and control of the forces of production and the
appropriation of profi]{.underline}t; and (b) [the contradiction between
the usevalue and exchange-value aspects of the commodity form and its
related forms in the capital relation]{.underline}. This second
contradiction has many faces. For example, productive capital is both
abstract value in motion (notably in the form of realised profits
available for reinvestment) and a concrete stock of already invested
time- and place-specific assets in the course of being valorised; the
worker is both an abstract unit of labour power substitutable by other
such units (or, indeed, other factors of production) and a concrete
individual (or member of a concrete collective workforce) with specific
skills, knowledge and creativity; [**wages** are both a cost of
production and a source of demand; **money functions** both as an
**international currency** exchangeable against other
currencies]{.underline} (ideally in stateless space) and as national
money circulating within national societies (or pluri-national monetary
blocs) and subject to a measure of state control; land functions both as
a form of property (based on the private appropriation of nature)
deployed in terms of expected revenues in the form of rent and as a
natural resource (modified by past actions) that is more or less
renewable and recyclable; knowledge is both the basis of intellectual
property rights and a collective resource (the intellectual commons)
(for a more detailed discussion, see Jessop, 2002).

#### The alternative is Marxist critical realism

**Yalvac 10** (Faruk Yalvaç. "Critical Realism, International Relations
Theory and Marxism". *Scientific Realism and International Relations*
Ch. 10. Palgrave Macmillan (2010). Lowell-KY)

Recent years have seen the rise of different idealist accounts of IR
theory, such as post-structuralism, reflectivism, interpretivism and
constructivist idealism, the latter having been the most powerful among
them. Yet despite their apparent diversity, all these positions are
based on a philosophical anti-realism and share parallel ontological
commitments (Wight, 2006a, 2007; Joseph, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2007;
Potamäki and Wight, 2000). [A Marxist social theory enriched
b]{.underline}y the principles of [critical realism]{.underline} (CR)
[can provide a radical alternative to]{.underline} both the [positivist
and constructivist accounts of IR, which]{.underline} ultimately
[consolidate and reproduce]{.underline} the worldwide system of
[capitalism,]{.underline} along [with]{.underline} its [structured
inequalities]{.underline}. In fact, in order [for IR theory
to]{.underline} fully [exploit the implications of CR, it must be
developed]{.underline} in connection [with a historical materialist
understanding of IR]{.underline}. And while claims have been made that
[CR]{.underline} can be forced to work with other theories of IR, it [is
most compatible with]{.underline} the principles of
[Marxism]{.underline}, which is the 'critical science of capitalism'
(Laffey and Dean, 2002: 92). In the words of Jonathan Joseph, 'Although
[scientific realism]{.underline} can be put to work on a range of
different theories \... its [relationship to Marxist theory is the most
convincing]{.underline}' (Joseph, 2007: 345). Chris Brown also refers to
Marxism when he argues that CR 'might perform an important role in
reinvigorating a tradition of thought which has been unjustly neglected
for the last twenty years or more' (Brown, 2007: 409, 415). [CR indeed
provides]{.underline} very fruitful [grounds]{.underline} on which to
heed Fred Halliday's call [for an 'encounter' between IR theory and
historical materialism]{.underline} (Halliday, 1994). At the current
conjuncture of IR theorising, a [Marxism inspired by critical realist
philosophy represents a very important means for overcoming]{.underline}
the current [stalemate brought]{.underline} about [by the
rationalist/reflectivist or positivist/ post-positivist
divide.]{.underline} This can be made clearer by returning to some of
the theoretical controversies of the 1970s and early 1980s, when the
need for a critical realist understanding of IR theory was as acute as
it is today. The late 1970s can be understood as the moment of initial
crisis in mainstream IR theorising, at the core of which was the
recognition of the positivist nature of IR theory, its ahistorical and
problem-solving nature and its shortcomings in explaining social change.
Many of the defects associated with mainstream IR theory are
acknowledged today, but their initial exposure occurred almost 30 years
after the Cold War at a time when realism had achieved undisputed
hegemony in IR theory. It was after this period of crisis that IR theory
witnessed the proliferation of new approaches such as critical theory,
historical sociology and, somewhat later, various post-positivist
approaches. [The emergence of CR coincided]{.underline} chronologically
[with the]{.underline} emergence in the 1970s of the interparadigm
debate, the [growth of neo-realist structuralism and the development of
a historical sociology of IR]{.underline} (Yalvaç, 1981). In 1978, Roy
Bhaskar published A Realist Theory of Science, and in the following
year, in The Possibility of Naturalism, he turned the views he had
developed regarding the natural sciences towards the social sciences. At
the time, Bhaskar's argu- ments concerning a [non-positivist naturalism
in social sciences provided a]{.underline} very important [alternative
to]{.underline} the undisputed [hegemony of positivism in]{.underline}
social sciences, including [IR theory]{.underline}. Today, [CR
is]{.underline} presented as [offering a solution to the concerns
of]{.underline} both [positivist and post-positivist understandings of
the real- ity of IR and providing a basis for understanding its
discursive and structural aspects]{.underline} without separating the
two (Joseph, 2007). In the 1970s, however, the intellectual climate was
completely different. I will try to substantiate the claims for a
critical realist understanding without separating the two today by
summarising its major issues in the chronology of IR theorising that
made it not only possible, but also necessary, to benefit from CR for an
alternative understanding of IR.

most vulnerable from the effects of climate change and offer the best
chance of lifting more communities out of poverty. What she does not
address [is how such objectives can be achieved without radical and
economic change.]{.underline} How can she reconcile a desire for
environmental sustainability with her membership in the B-Team, a group
of business leaders (formed at Davos) that includes Richard Branson,
whose Virgin Galactica project promises space tourism for the
super-rich? [Robinson's efforts, regardless how well-intended,
essentially domesticate the notion of climate justice, reducing it to a
moral problem that can purportedly be solved by persuading the rich and
corporations to do better.]{.underline} As an ecosocialist, I am a
staunch advocate for the eradication of global capitalism, which I view
as the main driver of anthropogenic climate change. [Many climate
activists continue to be reluctant to identify capitalism as the
"elephant in the room]{.underline}," thinking that doing so will
alienate many mainstream progressives. Within the Australian context,
where I operate, some climate activists will even engage in
"red-baiting" of ecosocialists within the movement. As the Australian
Greens have tried to mainstream themselves, they have likewise made life
for ecosocialists and ecoanarchists within the party very uncomfortable.
[Nevertheless, I believe that climate activists need to advance
alternatives to capitalism, not just tweaks like the adoption of
renewables, electric cars, and carbon pricing.]{.underline} We
**[anthropologists understand that social systems do not last
forever]{.underline}**. European feudalism persisted for some 900 years
but gradually evolved into capitalism, which over the course of 500
years evolved into a world system. [Many scholars and activists argue
that the world tried socialism and it failed,]{.underline} as was
illustrated by the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the emergence
authoritarian regimes such as Maoist China, North Korea, and Pol Pot
Cambodia. [These efforts to construct socialism failed for a variety of
historical and social-structural, internal and external, factors. Now,
**socialism needs to be re-envisioned for the twenty-first
century**]{.underline}, an effort underway in various quarters,
including among those developing the notion of ecosocialism. We need to
transcend speaking of "postcapitalism" without clearly envisioning what
should be next. Whatever we term the next system --- ecosocialism,
ecoanarchism, postcapitalism, global democracy, Great Transition ---
[the more crucial question is how we go from A to B, from capitalism to
whatever we may wish to term B.]{.underline} [**Needed are radical
transitional system-challenging reforms**, such as new left parties;
steep emissions taxes at sites of production; public ownership of the
means of production; increased social equality; stabilization of global
population; broadened democratic structures; meaningful work and shorter
work week; a steady-state global economy; energy efficiency, renewable
energy sources, appropriate technology, and green jobs; public
transportation; sustainable food production and forestry;
postconsumerism; sustainable trade; and eco- and community-friendly
settlement patterns. The transitional steps provide loose guidelines,
not a blueprint, for shifting human societies toward a more socially
just, democratic, and environmentally sustainable system]{.underline}
that can return the planet to a safer climate. **[Constructing an
alternative to global capitalism is the ultimate climate mitigation
strategy]{.underline}**, even though it will not be achieved anytime
soon, if indeed ever. Along the way, of course, many of the more modest
objectives promoted by the climate movement would be part of a
transition to an alternative world system, one that will be manifested
in different ways in different countries. [**Social movements will play
a crucial role in initiating the radical transitional
reforms**]{.underline} that I have delineated. These include the labor,
anti-corporate, justice, ethnic, women's, indigenous, environmental,
climate, and peace movements, all of which have tendencies or segments
that are explicitly anti-systemic. [Also, radically changing the world
will require a **multiplicity of interstitial movements situated within
mainstream society**]{.underline} where people develop alternative
social relations and communities. Social movements have historically
focused on relatively limited objectives, whether better wages and
working conditions in the case of the labor movement, voting rights and
economic and educational opportunities in the case of the women's and
civil rights movements, regulation in the case of the environment
movement, and so on. [The challenge anti-systemic movements now face is
uniting in their struggle against a common foe, namely, global
capitalism.]{.underline} Ethnic, national, religious, and cultural
differences too often have divided subalterns around the world and
prevented their forming a united revolutionary movement. [**A viable
anticapitalist movement will have to address the material
impoverishment** of much of the world's population.]{.underline} Many
parties, ranging from the World Bank to entertainment celebrities, make
appeals to "eradicate extreme poverty" or "make poverty history."
However, "make wealth, particularly extreme wealth, history," and the
eradication of poverty will follow. Personally, I hope that [**the
ecosocialist vision will serve as an integrative focus for anti-systemic
movements,** including the climate justice movement]{.underline}, within
nation-states and transnationally, although I recognize how daunting
this task will be. Much of the climate movement is focused on moving
beyond fossil fuels, a worthwhile endeavor. However, just as capitalism
operated on other forms of energy prior to the Industrial Revolution,
capitalism could theoretically operate on renewable sources of energy,
which will also require enormous resources to develop and maintain.
[**Even though some version of green capitalism might bring down
greenhouse gas emissions to some degree, it would not address the social
inequities, limited democracy, militarism, and the threat of nuclear
warfare** that are part and parcel of global capitalism.]{.underline}
Climate justice and social activists face an incredibly daunting task.
The next two or three decades, if not the next decade, will bring great
hardship for much of humanity, exacerbated by the rise of
authoritarianism, including in the US White House. As climate change
increasingly impacts human and non-human beings, the powers-that-be will
be inclined to construct a Fortress World to protect their privileges,
borders, and market system. There are no easy fixes to these grim
realities, but [it is imperative that climate activists become climate
justice activists as part of a **meta-movement to challenge and
transcend global capitalism.**]{.underline}

#### Ecosocialism solves- it accesses anti-imperialist movements and combines it with environmentalist organizations in order to reform the world order-

**Angus 11** Editor of Climate and Capitalism, (Ian,\"How to make an
ecosocialist revolution,\" Climate & Capitalism,
<https://climateandcapitalism.com/2011/10/07/how-to-make-an-ecosocialist-revolution//rL>

What to do now? Now at this point, you should be asking, "How can we do
that? How do we win mass support for the program and objectives we know
are essential?" That is exactly the right question to ask. Because if we
can't translate our ideas and our program into action, then our ideas
are irrelevant, and so are we. To cite another famous comment by Marx,
our task is not just to explain the world, our task is to change it. As
[Marxists, we use our analysis of the world as a basis for determining
what to do. First we ask, "what's going on?" Then we ask, "What is to be
done?"]{.underline} When we ask those questions today, we are all
intensely aware that although the need for revolution is very clear to
us, we are in a minority, not just in society at large, but even within
the left and within the environmental movement. As Marxist scholar
Fredric Jameson has written, we live in a time when for most people, "it
is [easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of
capitalism." Most green activists do not see capitalism as the primary
problem -- or, if they do, they don't believe an ecosocialist revolution
is possible or desirable. So the key task before us is not to proclaim
the revolution from every street corner, [but rather to find ways to
work with the broadest possible range of people as they are
today]{.mark}. The Latin American Marxist Marta]{.underline} Harnecker
has expressed it this way: "Being radical is not a matter of advancing
the most radical slogans, or of carrying out the most radical
actions.... "Being radical lies rather in creating spaces where broad
sectors can come together and struggle. For as human beings we grow and
transform ourselves in the struggle. "Understanding that we are many and
are fighting for the same objectives is what makes us strong and
radicalizes us[." [It is through struggles for change that we can win
the people who today find it easier to imagine the end of the world than
the end of capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. We cannot artificially
create majority support, but fortunately we can depend on capitalism and
imperialism to help us. Long ago, Marx and Engels said that what [[the
bourgeoisie produces, above all, are its own gravediggers. In 2011, we
have seen capitalism's future gravediggers]{.mark} come into direct
conflict with authoritarian governments, with imperialism, and with
capitalist austerity programs]{.underline}, in countries as diverse as
Chile, Spain, Greece, Tunisia, Egypt, Britain and even the United
States. We cannot tell in advance where mass struggles will break out,
or what forms they will take. That's not under our control. The best
slogans in the world won't do it. But capitalism will make it happen.
The real question is, will the next radicalization peter out, or be
defeated -- or will it move forward, and ultimately challenge capitalism
itself? [The movement we need There are no guarantees. Marxism is not
deterministic. The ecosocialist revolution is not inevitable. It will
only happen if people consciously decide that is necessary, and take the
steps needed to bring it about. As long ago as 1848, Marx and Engels
posed an alternative: the class struggle would lead either to
"]{.underline}a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large," ...
or to "the common ruin of the contending classes." In this century of
environmental crisis, the common ruin of all, the destruction of
civilization, is a very real possibility. One factor that will determine
the outcome -- in my opinion the single most important factor -- [is the
role that will be played by the people in this room]{.underline}, and by
others like you around the world. Spontaneous uprisings such as those
we've seen in Europe and North Africa this year are inevitable, but they
are not, by themselves, sufficient to bring into being "a revolutionary
administration whose definite and conscious aim will be to prepare and
further, in all available ways, human life for an ecological
civilization." [[That will not be achieved unless we are successful in
creating, in advance, an organized movement with a clear vision, an
ecosocialist program, that can bridge the gap between the spontaneous
anger of millions of people and the beginning of the ecosocialist
revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meetings such as this one can be part
of the process of building that movement. I don't have a blueprint for
how to build the movement we need. Indeed, one of the lessons we can
learn from the failures of socialism in the 20th century is that
centrally-dictated, one-size-fits-all plans for movement building will
always fail. Rather than a blueprint, let me suggest four
characteristics that movements committed to ecosocialism must share if
they are to have any chance of success. 1. [[Ecosocialists will extend
and apply ecosocialism's analysis and program.]{.mark}]{.underline} This
might seem obvious, but it's very important. In the past century, many
Marxists tried to freeze Marxism. After the death of Marx, or Engels, or
Lenin, or Trotsky, or Mao -- each group had its own cut-off point --
their Marxism stopped developing. From then on, no matter what the
situation, all they had to do was consult the sacred texts. All of the
answers were there. Some [organizations on the left still do this today.
That approach is completely alien to Marxism, which gives us a method,
but not all the answers. It doesn't even give us all the questions. In
their lifetimes, Marx and Engels studied the scientific, technological
and other discoveries of their time,]{.underline} and learned from the
struggles of their day. They used their new knowledge to extend, deepen
or change their political conclusions. Ecosocialism must follow their
example. There is not, and there will not be a perfect and immutable
ecosocialist program, no document we can point to and say, "That's it,
no more changes, we know what to do in all circumstances." A key task
for ecosocialists everywhere is to take the beginning points that
ecosocialism offers today, and to build on them using the method of
Marxism, the best scientific work of our time, and the lessons we learn
in struggles for change. Then we must apply our new understanding in a
wide variety of places and circumstances. This hard to do, because [it
requires us to think, to understand our situations and respond
appropriately and creatively,]{.underline} not just repeat the same old
slogans. Only if we do that can ecosocialism contribute effectively to
saving the earth. 2. Ecosocialists will be pluralist and open. Another
lesson we can learn from the 20th century is that monolithic socialist
grouplets do not turn into mass movements. They stagnate and decay, they
argue and they split, but they don't change the world. So I want to
emphasize that I am not urging you to rush out and found yet another
sect. [Ecosocialism is not a separate organization, it is a movement to
win existing red and green groups and individuals to an ecosocialist
perspectiv[e]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our ecosocialist programs define who
we are, they are the glue that holds us together. [But within that broad
framework, we need to understand that none of us has a monopoly on truth
and none of us has the magical keys to the ecosocialist
kingdom]{.underline}. We will undoubtedly disagree on many issues, and
[our debates will be vigorous. But if you agree that "[there can be no
true ecological revolution that is not socialist; no true socialist
revolution that is not ecological,"]{.mark} then what unites us is more
important than our differences. [We]{.mark}]{.underline} need to build a
democratic ecosocialist movement together. 3. [Ecosocialists [will be
internationalist and anti-imperialist]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within the
broad environmental movement, ecosocialists must be the strongest voices
for global climate justice. [All serious environmentalists must be
internationalists, if only because ecosystems don't respect national
borders.]{.underline} In particular, there is no national solution to
climate change. It must be fought for country-by-country, but only
international change can defeat it. International communication,
collaboration, and solidarity are absolutely essential. But for those of
us who live in the wealthy countries, the imperialist countries, there
must be much more to our internationalism. It's been said many times
that the people of the global South, and [indigenous people everywhere,
are the primary victims of climate change and other forms of
environmental destruction.]{.underline} What isn't said as often, but is
even more important, is that the primary environmental criminals are
"our" capitalists in the North. That places a special responsibility on
ecosocialists in the wealthy countries to combat the policies of our
governments and of the corporations that are based in our countries.
Today, the most powerful and important struggles for ecological justice
are taking place in the so-called Third World. At the barest minimum[,
we in the imperialist countries need to publicize those movements and
expose the role our home-grown capitalists play.]{.underline} We need to
show our solidarity as concretely as we can. We must give particular
emphasis and support to the demands raised in the Cochabamba Peoples
Agreement. We must demand that our governments give financial support
for adaptation to climate change, including the development of
ecologically sound agriculture. We must demand direct transfer of
renewable energy and other technologies, so that the poorest countries
can have economic development without contributing to global warming. (I
want to stress that unless and until we win this, no one in the North
has any right to criticize the energy and development choices made by
progressive movements and governments in the Third World.) [[We must
oppose so-called market solutions,]{.mark} and the commodification of
nature.]{.underline} This includes rejecting carbon trading in all its
forms. We must welcome climate refugees to our countries, offering them
decent lives with full human rights. [4. Ecosocialists [will actively
participate in and build movements for a better
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} Finally, and most important, ecosocialists
must be activists. We need to slow capitalism's ecocidal drive as much
as possible and to reverse it where we can, to win every possible
victory over the forces of destruction. As I've said, our [[rulers will
not willingly change]{.underline}]{.mark} -- but mass [[opposition can
force them to act, even against their will]{.underline}]{.mark}. There
are many environmental issues facing the world today, and I'm sure that
ecosocialists will be active in a wide variety of campaigns[. But the
scope and potential destructiveness of the climate emergency make it the
most important issue, and we need to give it the highest
priority.]{.underline} Our goal must be to bring together everyone --
socialists, liberals, deep greens, trade unionists, feminists,
indigenous activists and more -- everyone who is willing to demand that
governments act decisively to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. And
at the same time, we need to unite the forces that understand the need
to go beyond defensive battles, [[and lay the basis for a]{.mark}
[movement that can in fact initiate the ecosocialist
revolution]{.mark}.]{.underline} Fortunately those two tasks are not in
conflict. Fighting for immediate gains against capitalist destruction
and fighting for the ecosocialist future aren't separate activities,
they are aspects of one integrated process. It is through united
struggles for immediate gains and environmental reforms that working
people and farmers and indigenous people can build the organizations and
[the collective knowledge they need to defend themselves and advance
their interests. The victories they win in partial struggles will help
to build the confidence needed to take on bigger targets. [And it is
only by participating in and building such struggles that the
ecosocialist movement can grow, can win a hearing from wider
numbers]{.mark}]{.underline} of people, and can ultimately make an
ecosocialist revolution possible. The challenge we face The Peoples
Agreement adopted in Cochabamba eloquently expresses the challenge
before us. "Humanity confronts a great dilemma: to continue on the path
of capitalism, depredation, and death, or to choose the path of harmony
with nature and respect for life." "It is imperative that we forge a new
system that restores harmony with nature and among human beings[. "And
for there to be balance with nature, there must first be equity among
human beings." There, in three sentences, is the case for building a
movement to save the world, the case for an ecosocialist revolution. As
I've said, it will not be easy, but I cannot think of a more important
and worthwhile cause. Working together, **[we can put an end to
capitalism, before it puts an end to us.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Alt -- Anti-Cap 

#### The alternative is to engage in anticapitalism, an act of radical resistance grounded in grassroots movements. Anticapitalism does not represent an unattainable utopia but challenges common myths about capitalism as a whole.

Critical Introduction*, Zed Books, 2014. ProQuest Ebook Central,

*A note on terminology* The book will draw on four core concepts. The
first of these is capitalism. The term capitalism is used throughout the
book to refer to the prevailing form of social organization. While
acknowledging that the ways in which capitalism operates and the
implications of these operations are contested, this book defines
capital­ ism in terms of one commonly accepted distinguishing feature:
that capitalism is a system that organizes the production, distribution
and exchange of goods, on the basis of private property, with a view to
realizing profit and therefore increasing wealth. The second term is
alternative capitalism, which is used to describe a system where the
capitalistic relationship between state and market is re-regulated, but
not fundamentally reformed, in order to try to produce optimal social
and economic outcomes. The aim of an alternative capitalism is to
maximize wealth and profit by introducing a different structure of rules
to govern capitalism. The third concept is that of an alternative to
capitalism. [[An alternative to capitalism]{.mark} is distinct from
capitalism because it [places an emphasis on social and civic
goals]{.mark}, rather than purely focusing on pecuniary gain. In
contrast to capitalism, an alternative to capitalism is founded on
collective or community property rights, rather than individual property
rights, although the form and extent of collective or community property
rights may vary.]{.underline} Where the book is referring to either an
alternative capitalism or an alternative to capitalism, it uses the form
'alternative (to) capitalism'. [The final concept the book uses is
anti-capitalism. It uses the term [anti-capitalism]{.mark} to [refer to
the act of resisting capitalism, whether this occurs by attempting to
influence the state, taking control of the state, or actions taken
independently or outside of the state.]{.mark} An individual who pursues
or wishes to pursue an alternative to capitalism can therefore be
described as an anti-capitalist.]{.underline}

Traditions of Resistance\
In its consideration of capitalism and its alternatives, this book
accepts that it is possible to perceive capitalism and its con­ sequences
in different ways. Furthermore, it acknowledges that the way in which
capitalism and its consequences are perceived will have a fundamental
impact on whether people deem capitalism to be desirable, whether they
would prefer an alternative capitalism or an alternative to capitalism,
and therefore whether they believe that it is important and worthwhile
engaging in resistance to capitalism through the social act of
anti-capitalism. However, [the central argument]{.underline} of this
book [is that **[capitalism displays intrinsic tendencies towards crisis
that make an alternative to capitalism desirable, and]{.mark} so
[justifies anti-capitalist action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In doing so,
it argues that [[capitalism is a product of social interaction between
people, and]{.mark} that it [is remade or resisted through our social
action. This ­emphasis on social constitution challenges common
assertions about the inevitability of capitalist logic,]{.mark} and in
the process shows that the prospect of realizing an alternative to
capitalism is more than wishful thinking]{.underline}. In its
discussions of alternatives to capitalism, however, [this book guards
against thinking of alternative forms of social organization as outcomes
or utopias. Rather, it shows how various forms of alternative social and
economic organization have shown a tendency to degenerate over time, or
to reproduce injustices of capitalist social relations. It therefore
suggests that **[alternatives to capitalism should be thought of as
processes that need to be continually]{.mark} made and [remade]{.mark}
if they are [not to degenerate or reproduce the injustices of capitalist
social relations, and if desirable outcomes are to be
realized]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Reflecting the book's emphasis on the
social constitution of economy and society, [it rejects 'top-down'
attempts to impose an alternative to capitalism by political means, and
argues that anticapitalist action should take a 'bottom-up'
form]{.mark}, which requires democratic and pluralistic experimentation
with different models of social and economic organization to expand the
space in which non-capitalist activity takes place.]{.underline}

[The arguments of the book therefore fit with a long tradition of
anti-capitalist resistance]{.underline}. One of the most well-known
instances of this kind of resistance was the insurrections of 1968,
typified by the student revolts in Paris in May of that year. However,
as Michael Watts (2001: 167) noted, the events of 1968 were far more
than a local phenomenon; over seventy countries 'had major student ­
actions during that year \[and between\] October 1967 and July 1968
there were over 2000 incidents worldwide of student protest alone'.
Furthermore, it was not just students engaged in the act of protest, the
act of anti-capitalism. According to Watts' (ibid.: 167) study, 'if one
were to add the related worker and other nonstudent demonstrations each
country in the world would, on average, have had over 20 "incidents"
over the nine-month period'. Nor was the substance of the protest
uniform; 1968 had what Watts (ibid.: 171-- 2) has described as its
Eastern, Western and Southern moments. In the first, typified by the
Prague Spring and the Cultural Revolution in China, the focus of
protests was anti-bureaucratic, and directed against the 'Old Left' and
the corruption people perceived in it. In the second, typified by
student protests in Paris and Berkeley, the focus of protests was
opposition to consumerism and the pursuit of civil and social rights. In
the third, the focus was the rejection of authority in the first
generation of independent states in Africa and Latin America, where
military dictatorship had displaced democratic rule.

Luc Boltanski (2002: 6) also highlights the diversity of the 1968
movement by distinguishing between its social and artistic critiques,
where the former focused on inequality and poverty stemming from
capitalism, and the latter on liberation, individual autonomy and
authenticity. Michael Löwy (2002: 95) links this distinction between the
social and artistic critique of capitalism to romanticism, which he
defines as 'rebellion against modern capitalist society, in the name of
past or premodern social and cultural values, as a protest against the
modern disenchantment of the world'. Therefore, [the significance of
1968 can be seen not just across space, but also as a reflection of
long-established traditions of resistance to prevailing social,
political and economic forms or organization. On such readings, [the
events of 1968 can be interpreted as a demonstration of long-standing
anti-capitalist feeling that rested on a critique of the world we live
in and the injustices it creates, and in turn motivated action in order
to try to address them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The alt is empirically supported and is part of a broader discussion on challenging capitalism.

However, [[the]{.mark} events of the late 19[60s]{.mark} were
significant in at least two senses. First, they [showed that people are
willing and able to ask important questions about society and to express
their discontent by taking action]{.mark}]{.underline} (Watts 2001:
160). Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the events occurred during
the pinnacle of the expansion of post-war liberal capitalism, and were
not the product of a capitalist crisis as such (ibid.: 162; Löwy 2002:
96). This suggests that [[resistance to capitalism is constantly
simmering beneath the surface as an expression of a generalized
discontent with the implications of the prevailing form of social and
economic organization]{.mark}, and that [anti-capitalism is more than a
fleeting moment associated with undesirable yet historically specific
circumstances]{.mark} such as unemployment or rising
inflation.]{.underline}

These [notions that the anti-capitalism of 1968 either represented 'pure
nothingness' or resulted in a compromised and co-opted political left
can clearly be challenged by [the persistence of anti-capitalist
activity throughout the world]{.mark}. There are many such examples,
which [include]{.mark} action by indigenous movements seeking to protect
their land from appropriation by the state. This is typified by [the
Zapatista resistance to]{.mark} the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}merican
[F]{.mark}ree [T]{.mark}rade [A]{.mark}greement in Mexico]{.underline}
(Cuninghame 2008), [[which has gathered support far beyond the Zapatista
communities themselves]{.mark}, as they have been able to use
communications technologies in order to 'get their message out despite
governmental spin and censorship']{.underline} (Cleaver 2008: 130).
Alongside other organized activities, [the ability of the Zapatista
movement ­ to raise awareness of its struggle has 'facilitated
discussions and debate among concerned observers [that led to the
organization of protest and support activities in over forty
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} around the world' (ibid.: 130). [Despite
claims that the anti-capitalism of the 1960s was a failure, such
movements show that people are still willing to question the capitalist
system and to try to create an alternative. [On a smaller scale,
organizations like the Starbucks Workers Campaign have shown a similar
willingness to question the prevailing form of social and economic
organization, by challenging the notion of progressive
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Shukaitis 2008: 104). Some of the
anti-capitalist actions featuring prominently in the media have included
the Battle of Seattle against the World Trade Organization, and the 2009
protests against the G20 in London, but there have been many more
besides (see Tormey 2004: 177-- 9 for a timeline). [[All of these
varying forms of ongoing struggle indicate people's continued
willingness to question capitalism, ponder alternatives, and consider
how they might be realized.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[One of the most enduring forums in which this tradition of res­istance
can be seen is [the World Social Forum]{.mark}, which [has brought
together civil society organizations]{.mark} every year since 2001 in
order [to discuss]{.mark} and debate the possibilities for [an
alternative future]{.mark}.\]{.underline}

JX.

"[A [real debate on the arms trade is]{.mark} nearly [absent from public
conversation]{.mark} because the industry can only thrive in secrecy and
duplicity. Consider former House Speaker Paul Ryan's final move as a
public official, in which he snuck a provision to curtail debate on
Saudi support in Yemen into the U.S. farm bill in December.]{.underline}
Fortunately, Ryan's manipulative tactics would fail to prevent the House
from finally passing a resolution to end U.S. support for the war in
Yemen on February 13. Trump has indicated the Yemen resolution will be
his first veto, as it represents a major check to executive power and a
direct rebuke to his arms export-based style of diplomacy. After Trump
pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as
the Iran nuclear deal, defense companies enjoyed an immediate boost to
their stock. This is because demand in the arms trade surges alongside
geopolitical instability. Heightened volatility encourages higher arms
sales, and the dissemination of weapons to despotic regimes increases
volatility, creating a vicious cycle further entrenched by a revolving
door of defense contractors who influence public policy to benefit
private weapons manufacturers. [In his famous farewell speech, President
Dwight Eisenhower warned the U.S. public of this exact predicament, what
he called the "military-industrial complex." President Eisenhower's
warning remains prescient nearly 60 years later, as the failure to

As shorthand for giving conceptual definition to the global ascent of a
balder, market-centric political logic, 'n[eoliberalism' will perhaps
inevitably be invoked in ways that suggest an all too neat doctrinal
coherence.1 The use of the term **risks two distinct
pitfalls**.]{.underline} [The first is the overly reductive use of a
necessarily reductive term, where its expanse becomes so broad, its
implications and effects so **monolithic** and **totalizing**, that the
fact of its different articulations is occluded; or sidelined as
'merely' a matter of rhetoric]{.underline}. The principal risk here is
that [this inculcates a mode of reified analysis where]{.underline}, to
paraphrase Smith\'s (2005) analogous observations of the commonplace
uses of the term 'globalization', [the 'thing' we call neoliberalism
starts assuming causal properties in its own right --- that is, it
becomes the 'it' which does the explaining, rather than the political
phenomenon that needs to be explained.]{.underline} [This
can]{.underline}, in turn, [spawn a kind of grand theorizing that can
easily suggest an outright colonization of the identity deemed
neoliberal]{.underline}, such as a 'state' or 'political party', [when
such institutions are much more usefully understood as composites of
multiple identities, aspects of which are likely to be the site of
hegemonic tensions with the neoliberalized elements.]{.underline}

[The second potential pitfall involves a more empirically exacting use
of the term]{.underline} --- the approach essentially followed by Smith
--- [where neoliberalism is more rigidly defined in terms of more
transparently neoliberal political identities]{.underline} (Thatcher,
Reagan, Joseph, Hayek, Friedman, etc.). Endeavouring to map and identify
a specific, theoretically literate neoliberal genealogy is certainly a
useful exercise. But [the danger here is that it orientates the analyst
towards a circumscribed mode of investigation, which deflects attention
from other, putatively non-neoliberal political agents and
structures]{.underline}. The point may seem trite, but one does not have
to exhibit the overt pro-market ideological posturing of a Thatcher or
Friedman to act 'neoliberal'. [The fact that neoliberalism is an
identity marker more routinely ascribed by critics and analysts, rather
than self-asserted by 'neoliberals' themselves]{.underline}, suggests
that [what takes place at a surface level of political
self-identification is not a very useful barometer for indicating 'who'
or 'what' might be constituted as neoliberal.]{.underline}

**[This article argues that it is far too soon---analytically in the one
case and historically in the other---to sign on to either the Marxist or
mainstream position about the relationship between human rights and
neoliberalism]{.underline}**. To the first position, **[much more
analytical clarity is required to prove more than a simple case of
conjuncture between the two phenomena that are sometimes too easily
conflated]{.underline}**. To the second, **[the record so far suggests
that human rights seem fit to provide little, if any, help in
remedying]{.underline}** (let alone overturning) **[the development in
the history of capitalism that its critics range under the heading
"neoliberalism]{.underline}**." In largest part that is because,
although the record of capitalism in our time is highly mixed when it
comes to the achievement and violation of basic human rights, its most
serious victim is equality (of resources and opportunities alike) both
in national and global settings---a value that the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights of 1948 and the international human rights movements
following in its wake do not even set out to defend.10 **[Since
globalizing neoliberalism and international human rights emerged at the
same moment and developed in parallel, there are undoubtedly connections
to be found. But the interactions between human rights and neoliberalism
are more subtle than Marxists so far claim]{.underline}**. Indeed, the
crucial connection is a missed connection: [precisely because the human
rights revolution has at its most ambitious dedicated itself to
establishing a normative and actual floor for protection, it has failed
to respond to---or even allowed for recognizing--- neoliberalism's
obliteration of the ceiling on inequality]{.underline}. "Neoliberalism,"
especially in leftist discourse, often does massive work in diverse
settings of argument, coming close through its overuse to functioning as
a call for explanation rather than the real thing. [And with its moral
charge, it is sometimes deployed like holy water, sprinkled liberally
for safety's sake to ward off evil]{.underline}. Although its rise as an
item of discourse and apotropaic talisman reflects understandable anger,
it is also symptomatic of explanatory confusion.11 Nonetheless, as David
Singh Grewal and Jedediah Purdy indicate in their introduction to this
issue, [citing an inadequate shorthand for the complex of individualist
thought, market solutions, and state retrenchment both domestically and
internationally is better than omitting these topics altogether, as
American legal scholarship has so far done to its
detriment]{.underline}.12 But looking beyond America, the prominence of
neoliberalism as a category in scholarship about human rights means that
the exact nature of the linkage of the two requires as much attention as
the omission of the former from thinking about the latter. "[Human
rights, as with power and money, became a means to an end of globalizing
neoliberal democracy,]{.underline}" Stephen Hopgood remarks in his much
noticed recent study, in a commonplace observation.13 And yet, so far,
**[Marxists such as Wendy Brown, Susan Marks, and others have offered
indeterminate and unsubstantiated claims that do not suffice to
plausibly elevate the chronological coincidence of human rights and
neoliberalism into a factually plausible syndrome]{.underline}**. For
there is a long way from historical "coincidence" or
companionship---which there certainly has been between neoliberalism and
the human rights phenomenon---to actual causality and complicity. "[We
would do well to take the measure of whether and how the centrality of
human rights discourse might render . . . other political possibilities
more faint,"]{.underline} Brown has argued in a classic indictment at
the center of the recent commentary.14 Even this displacement theory,
about which Brown explicitly invites further reflection rather than
offering a strong conclusion, is weak compared to the much stronger
accusation of complicity that Brown and others simultaneously offer.15
[Though it seems likely that some displacement of other schemes of
justice has indeed occurred thanks to the rise of human rights, I do not
think a much stronger claim is likely to work]{.underline}.16 To say
that human rights were coincident with or part of the context of
neoliberal victory is not only not to say more---it is also not to say
much. **[In particular, it is not to say that neoliberalism has required
human rights to make its way in the world---or vice
versa]{.underline}**. Picayune an agenda as it might seem to specify how
weakly related the ascent of human rights appears to the market
fundamentalism of our time, I suggest that the finding of only a tenuous
relationship between the two has substantial ramifications for judging
human rights and their spectacular rise in the last few decades---and
thus for assessing the mainstream position. [Excusing human rights from
causally abetting the free market victory of the neoliberal age is,
after all, no defense of their prominence today]{.underline}. It is
certainly worth considering the possibility that human rights provide
some sort of moral leverage against neoliberal developments. However,
even if the value of the normative guidance that human rights provide is
undoubted, the trouble is that it amounts to little more than a set of
mostly rhetorical admonitions. [Worse, by focusing on a minimum floor of
human protection, human rights norms prove inadequate in facing the
reality that neoliberalism has damaged equality locally and globally
much more than it has basic human rights outcomes]{.underline} (which,
in some cases, it may indeed have advanced). It is hardly less
distressing, but, so far, much more justifiable to conclude that human
rights have not made enough of a difference in the short timeframe and
global space they share with their neoliberal frère ennemi. They have
been condemned to watch but have been powerless to deter. Added to the
fact that human rights at least as canonically established have nothing
to say about the principal value of equality that neoliberalism
threatens, it seems hard to conclude that they are a useful resource in
response[. If my perspective in between Marxism and the mainstream is
adequate, it also follows that there is not much critical or political
value in opposing human rights out of understandable outrage at
neoliberalism]{.underline}. Instead, the economic transformations of the
current era force a heavy burden on those concerned to formulate or to
find a more serious analytical account of economic transformations and
to offer more robust political resistance than they have marshaled so
far. [And since human rights idioms, approaches, and movements are
unlikely to offer either---and, indeed, do not strive to do so when it
comes to inequality---they should stick to their minimalist tasks
outside the socioeconomic domain, in part to avoid drawing fire for
abetting the stronger companion of their historical epoch.]{.underline}

Forty years later, in September 2016, The Nation republished Letelier's
classic piece alongside documentation proving Chilean strongman Augusto
Pinochet's role in Letelier's Washington, D.C. killing. Introduced by
left­ wing intellectual Naomi Klein, it was now important to claim a
different or deeper link between human rights values and neoliberal
policies than Letelier had asserted. Since 1976, the economics that had
debuted in Chile had gone global, both to a series of other national
settings as a result of demo­ cratic choice and to international
financial institutions that were to impose them, far less willingly, in
many other locales as a matter of technocratic not enough expertise. For
[Klein,]{.underline} in the most popular history of neoliberalism ever
written, [it was not just that free market politics were inimical to
human rights outcomes. It was that human rights movements were to blame
for collusion or at least distraction from this truth]{.underline}. Her
admiration for Lete­ lier notwithstanding, [Klein asserted that human
rights imposed "blinders" on the relationship between neoliberalism and
terror]{.underline}. "The human rights movement," Klein observed of the
Chilean scene, "helped the Chicago School ideology to escape from its
first bloody laboratory virtually un­ scathed." Amnesty International,
for example, took a neutral attitude toward root causes, refusing to
single out the deepest culprit for the events so as to focus on an
informational politics that merely named and shamed incon­ testable state
abuses. "Where the effects of neo­liberal reconstruction began to bite,"
one of Klein's admirers puts the general case, human rights law and
mobilization "leav\[e\] unchallenged the conditions in which those
abuses had become possible." Is decrying the terrors of neoliberalism
without men­ tioning neoliberalism in effect to collude with evil?2 That
admirer, international lawyer Susan Marks, contends that "the history of
human rights cannot be told in isolation from developments in the
history of capitalism." If human rights fail to grapple with the causes
of state violence, the rise of neoliberalism is part of the explanation
why human rights took off as the prime optic for justice locally and
globally. "The human rights movement as we know it today took shape
during the 1970s," Marks explains. "\[And\] a rather important aspect of
the context for the movement's emergence is . . . the rise in that
period of the neo­liberal version of 'private' capitalism, with its now
familiar policy prescription of privatisation, deregulation and state
retreat from social provision." It is no accident that progressive
attempts to pursue human rights across the world have coincided with the
"last utopia" of neoliberalism. At the very least, campaigns for human
rights distract from the true source of the very evils they purport to
oppose.3 If few in the 1970s anticipated the neoliberal age that
followed, forty years on it seems pressing to reassess how human rights
fit into the political economy of their own age of at least rhetorical
ascendancy. Nationally, welfare states entered crisis; globally, if a
"new international economic order" prevailed, it was one in which market
fundamentalism made impres­ sive inroads, with inequality exploding in
many nations. Yet human rights enjoyed increasing prominence in that
very neoliberal age---breaking out into mass visibility in the 1970s
when neoliberalism experienced its first 174 Human Rights in the
Neoliberal Maelstrom breakthroughs, and ascending to something like a
consensus public phi­ losophy in worldwide ethics in the 1990s, when
neoliberalism occupied the same status in worldwide economics. The
striking correspondence between the two naturally raises the question of
their relationship to each other. [Klein's allegation]{.underline},
however, **[is exaggerated and implausible]{.underline}**. [It does not
fairly or properly position human rights in their neoliberal
age]{.underline}. [In what sense did human rights "help" neoliberalism
make its way?]{.underline} [Though sharing the same moral individualism
with their economic rival, and the same sus­ picion of collectivist
projects like nationalism and socialism, **human rights surely did not
bring the neoliberal age about**]{.underline}. It was not the job of
human rights activists to save Marxism from its theoretical quandaries
or the left from its practical failures. [There is no reason to think
that a human rights stigmatizing "superficial" abuses could not coexist
with a more "structural" politics,]{.underline} just as Letelier
demanded. Whatever the relationship so far of human rights law and
movements to their neoliberal companion, they also brought unprecedented
scrutiny not merely to state violence around the world but to the
profound failures of states to treat their citizens equally no matter
their gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation. [Human rights
movements also called more and more on longstanding
resources]{.underline}---starting with the social rights in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948---[for demanding economic
entitlement]{.underline}s, from employment to housing to food. And in
fact, for all of its sins, what Klein calls the "disaster capitalism" of
neoliberalism could sometimes fulfill the wildest dreams of human rights
law, as Chinese marketization brought more human beings out of poverty
than any other force---certainly including the human rights movement
itself---has in history. None of this means that human rights failed to
conform to their neoliberal ambiance. Just as before in its modern
career, the notion that individuals have basic rights was shaped by the
political economy that always affects so much else in moral ideals and
social relations. Human rights had been strongly linked to classical
liberalism in the nineteenth century, which meant their deployment as
slogans for defenders of free contracts and in­ violable property. In the
mid­twentieth­century age of national welfare, human rights were recast in
the spirit of egalitarian hopes within discrete and exclusionary
communities. Finally, [neoliberalism]{.underline} once again [exerted a
strong pressure of redefinition]{.underline}. [Never did the language of
human rights revert to the narrow protection of contract and
property]{.underline}, as in the nineteenth century when Karl Marx
denounced the effect and for which Hayek could 175 not enough still wax
nostalgic in the 1940s. [Although the two movements for human rights and
neoliberal policies shared the same abstract lifespan, **their concrete
relation to each other was far from straightforward**]{.underline} in
its details across time and space. When their relationship is
reconstructed more carefully, taking account of economic and social
rights as they were restored to the agenda after the Cold War ended, the
argument has to change dramatically. The older association of human
rights with national welfare was surely uprooted by a countervailing
trend. [Even as human rights were updated for a newly visible brand of
cross­border politics as neoliberalism's own version of cosmopolitan
globalization took off, **they were reimagined as international tools of
status equalization**]{.underline}, especially when it came to dis­
crimination against women and other subordinated groups. Human rights
law and politics, if not to blame for causing or distracting from
neoliberal assumptions, were nonetheless condemned to a defensive and
minor role in pushing back against the new political economy. **[The
trouble was not so much that human rights obscured a necessary
structural politics]{.underline}** as that, as latecomers in the new era
to distributional concerns of any kind, they stig­ matized only the shame
of material insufficiency while turning a blind eye to galloping
material inequality. Great advances were made when it came to status
equality and supranational responsibility, but at the high price of
material fairness at every scale, for which human rights law lacked the
norms and human rights movements the will to advocate.

[In examining the reasons why U.S. hegemony is antithetical to the
recognition, enforcement, and practice of human rights]{.underline} in
the Third World, three examples come to mind: (1) U.S. arms sales to the
Third World, (2) the 46 The Future of Global Relations issue of Third
World debt to the richer nations, and (3) U.S. foreign aid. [On the
matter of arms sales, "Third World arms expenditures]{.underline} after
1970 [grew nearly threefold]{.underline} by 1987, [even in
regions]{.underline} such as Latin America and Africa [that were
generally not at war, and in some years exceeded the economic aid they
received]{.underline}."15 As recently as August 2007, [**under the guise
of promoting a "security dialogue" in the Persian Gulf, the Bush
administration proposed \$63 billion in arms transfers** to the Middle
East over the course of the ensuing decade]{.underline}. The foundation
of the deal was a pledge to sell \$20 billion worth of high-tech arms to
Saudi Arabia and the other oil-producing states in the region. Further[,
**to ease any concerns about the Gulf buildup, the U.S. plan called for
increasing military aid to Israel and Egypt**]{.underline} to \$3
billion and \$1.3 billion per year, respectively. The cost to the U.S.
taxpayer for this kind of support amounts to about \$43 billion over the
ensuing decade. [**After more than sixty years of arms races in the
Middle East, it is clear that the only real beneficiaries will be U.S.
arms makers**. On the matter of Third World debt, we find
that]{.underline} "notwithstanding a temporary restructuring of nearly
half of its debt during the 1980s[, the external debt of the developing
nations increased to an all-time high]{.underline} of \$1.270 trillion
in 1991, only to catapult to \$1.970 trillion in 1999[; debt service
payments increased to 120 percent."16 Now, add to these numbers the real
story of U.S. foreign aid]{.underline}. On the matter of foreign aid, it
has been noted that "[if all foreign aid given since 1950 had been
invested in U.S. Treasury Bills, the assets of poor countries by 2001
would have amounted to \$2.3 trillion]{.underline}. Of course, the [aid
was not invested in such a fashion**. Instead, much of it went to build
a foreign aid bureaucracy**]{.underline}. For example, the World Bank's
administrative expenses grew from \$81 million in 1959--1960 to \$1.5
billion in 1993--1994...while its staff grew from 657 to 7,106."17
Meanwhile, the typical poor country has stagnated. In this regard, Noam
Chomsky notes, "[The basic rules of world order remain]{.underline} as
they have always been: [the rule of law for the weak, the rule of force
for the strong; **the principles of 'economic rationality' for the weak,
state power and intervention for the strong."**]{.underline}18

Putzel argues similarly, by stating that there is a growing consensus
that the United States has emerged as an imperial power- the world's
single superpower. [It appears that the US pursuits the ‗imperial'
project as ‗an attempt to permanently order the world of states and
markets according to its national interests.' What some argue from a
humanitarian perspective, others argue from an economic perspective,
underlining that the US has emerged as uncontested hegemonic capable of
enforcing peace and property rights and presiding over a new ‗liberal
international economic order', ensuring progress in both developed and
developing regions of the world through globalization.]{.underline} The
article further states that imperialism has become a precondition for
democracy (Putzel 2006[). As we have seen, the USA are hegemonic and
tries to rank itself as the world's only superpower, and in order to do
so, the concept of global democracy and the spreading of such was seen
vital for the American government. This attempt to spread democracy
globally will be discussed in the next part.]{.underline} [According to
Noam Chomsky, the main principle that the USA uses in order to be
globally dominant is instead ―the spreading of democracy‖, and he
explains that this imperial power is mainly represented by economic and
financial grip holds and ―liberations‖ that the US tries to force upon
the entire planet. The USA is exporting its free-market values through
global commercial agreements (―exporting American values‖). The
―American values‖ are most dramatically illustrated by the wave of the
future: telecommunications, the Internet, advanced computer technology,
and the other wonders created by the exuberant American entrepreneurial
spirit unleashed by the market (Chomsky 1999:65f). Chomsky explains that
the main political-economic principles and mission of American can be
found in the ―crusade for democracy‖, which was first waged during the
Reagan years. The results are commonly offered as a prime illustration
of how the USA became ―the inspiration for the triumph of democracy in
our time‖, to quote the editors of a leading intellectual journal of
American liberalism]{.underline} (Chomsky 1999:95). The primary
―barriers to implementation‖ of democracy are efforts to ―protect
domestic markets‖- that is to prevent foreign corporations to gain even
more control over the society. We are to understand, then, that
democracy is enhanced as significant decision making shifts even more
into the hands of unaccountable private tyrannies, mostly foreign-based.
Meanwhile the public arena is to shrink still further as the state is
minimized in accordance with the neoliberal political and economic
principles that have emerged triumphant. Thinking about this, we gain
some useful insight into the concepts of democracy and markets, as well
as American political-economic strategies, in the operative sense
(Chomsky 1999:96). Given the definition of the ―barrier to
implementation‖ of democracy, [Chomsky further argues, the USA has
totally failed to spread democracy globally. However, Washington has a
totally different concept and strategy and merely seems to use

I N SEPTEMBER 1999, THE UNITED STATES OFFERED NORTH KOREA A DEAL:
DOLLARS for disarmament. In exchange for North Korea freezing its
missile development program, the U.S. would lift the economic sanctions
that have prevented trade between the two countries for the past 50
years. Shortly before the June 2000 summit between the two Korean
leaders, the U.S. finally followed through on its promise to ease
sanctions. Despite a nascent détente on the Korean peninsula, however,
the U.S. refuses to retire its East Asian containment policy. In other
words, although the Clinton administration indicated a willingness to
help North Korea enter the global market, the U.S. has refused to remove
any of the weapons or troops that currently threaten North Korea. [This
combination of militarism and neoliberal engagement exemplifies U.S.
relations toward East Asia more generally\^ The U.S. struggles to
maintain the Cold War in Asia on the basis of 100,000 troops,
considerable hardware, and sizable contributions from Japan, South
Korea, and the Philippines. At the same time, particularly in the wake
of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, /the U.S. government has
consistently pushed for neoliberal reforms that involve the
privatization of state assets, the lowering of barriers to trade, and
the elimination of restrictions on the transnational movement of
capital.]{.underline} In some case U.S. economic and military objectives
have overlapped the U.S. State Department and the Commerce Department
have worked hand in hand. Conventional arms sales, high-tech research
programs, and lowered trade barriers have acconiplished both objectives
of greater market access for U.S. businesses and stronger alhed military
postures against perceived enemies. [Yet globalization and U.S.
militarism do not always mix well in East Asia. Certain military
imperatives, such as a regional missile defense system, have driven
wedges between countries that neoliberals want to unite through free
trade. Moreover, certain economic trends, such as the deregulation of
financial markets, have weakened some of the very countries that U.S.
troops and battleships are pledged to protect.]{.underline} Herein lies
the central problem for U.S. poHcy toward East Asia: the tension between
core mihtary and economic objectives. U.S. mihtary strategy in the
region depends on the maintenance of the Cold War, with North Korea,
China, or a set of new \"threats\" substituting for the Soviet Union.
U.S. economic strategy, although initially forged ih the crucible of the
Cold War, is increasingly dependent on breaking down ideological
divisions in the region. The U. S. is thus Janus-faced: simultaneously
looking backward to the Cold War and forward to the single global
capitahst market. In terms of international relations theory, this
conflict pits Reahsts, and their concern with balance of power, against
Liberals, and their behef that trade will foster greater interdependence
(Buzan and Segal, 1994: 3).2 Although the U.S. has not drawn down its
military presence in Asia and the arms trade has not diminished,
security relations in the region are nonetheless changing. Economic
forces have been undermining the pillars of security policy. [As the
effects of globalization intensify, new technologies and new trade
relations are changing the terms of military engagement.]{.underline}
[Perhaps the most salent of the technological changes involves weapons
of mass destruction. Since the Gulf War, there has been a growing
perception that conventional armies, no matter their size, cannot stand
up to a technologically advanced adversary]{.underline} (Bracken, 1999).
Throughout Asia, this perception has translated into more investments in
computerization (e.g., \"smart weapons\") and advanced communication
systems (e.g., satellites) (Parker, 1999: 5).5 Countries are also
investing in what they consider the cheaper alternative of ABC weapons
--- atomic, biological, and chemical --- despite considerable evidence
that atomic weapons are not cheap and biological/chemical weapons are
not as effective as advertised (Passell, 1998; Mueller and Mueller,
1999). India and Pakistan went public in 1998 with their nuclear weapons
program. North Korea has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons, and
was nearly drawn into war with the United States in 1994 over its
nuclear program. China is seeking to upgrade its strategic forces and
make up for its lack of spud-fuel intercontinental missiles and MIRV
capacity (Swaine, 1999: 36). Japan maintains its \"recessed deterrence\"
--- a capability to rapidly develop nuclear weapons if circumstances in
the region dramatically alter (Buzan, 1995: 41). [A new global market in
advanced weaponry --- the logical result of the neoliberal application
of market principles to all facets of existence --- is accelerating the
spread of these technologies. Nonproliferation regimes have largely
failed to hmit the sales of sophisticated weapons by developed and
developing countries alike.]{.underline} Security rationales drive
nonproliferation efforts; economics undercut them. The major
industrialized countries hope to increase meirket share for their own
mihtary industries, and to utilize economies of scale to cut the costs
of maintaining their own armies. The U.S. government, for instance,
officially supports \"free trade\" while simultaneously doing all it can
to subsidize the domestic arms industry. [Lockheed Martin, the world\'s
largest manufacturer and seller of arms, receives more federal funding
than the nation\'s largest welfare program (Arms Trade Resource Center,
2000). The major arms sellers routinely take advantage ofthe U.S.
government\'s Defense Export Loan Guarantee Fund to boost overseas sales
(Ibid.). Meanwhile, more economically desperate countries, such as North
Korea and Kazakhstan, do not bother with the \"free trade\" rhetoric;
they simply sell high-tech systems because they need the hard
currency.]{.underline}

A colorful legend holds that when God offered the Torah to the
Israelites at Mt. Sinai, they were reluctant to accept it. God then
lifted the mountain over their heads in a threatening manner, making
them an offer they could not refuse. They reconsidered. [The saga of
economic liberalism, sometimes dubbed \"neoliberalism,\" and Israeli
economic growth bears some similarities to that legend. Modern Israel
has developed into something of an economic miracle, largely as a result
of economic liberalization, driven by entrepreneurship, innovation,
investment, and the accumulation of human capital. Yet Israelis have
never been entirely comfortable with economic liberalism and indeed are
by and large hostile to it.1 Like their wandering ancestors, they have
benefitted in spite of their disinclinations.]{.underline} The Reluctant
\"Start-Up Nation\" Israelis may be the most entrepreneurial population

Western Europe, not per capita, but in absolute numbers.4 With a
population of eight million people, Israel has over 6,000 startups. In
the 2015 Bloomberg Innovation Index, Israel was ranked ahead of the
United States, France, and the United Kingdom.5 The number of Israeli
patents is among the largest for any country in the world6 while shares
of numerous Israeli companies trade on the American NASDAQ stock
exchange as well as other exchanges. Acquisitions of Israeli high-tech
companies by foreign investors inject many billions of dollars into the
country every year. Among the reasons for the country\'s success are its
well-educated labor force, a high household savings rate, high levels of
imported capital, a strong immigration rate (which includes many
highly-educated people), and especially\--in recent years\--an extremely
creative high-tech sector, which so far operates largely outside the
realm of government regulation. [This economic good news is all the more
remarkable in light of the fact that Israel began its existence in the
late 1940s as an impoverished third-world country, whose economy might
have been discussed in the same breath as that of India or Egypt. Today,
Israel has a gross domestic product per capita comparable to that of the
middle-income countries of Western Europe, roughly the same as Italy\'s.
Israel was one of the only countries in the world whose economy did not
contract during the global financial crisis that began in 2007. Its
rates of inflation and unemployment have been better than those of the
United States and Western Europe in recent years. The economy has shown
its resilience in the face of numerous challenges and shocks, including
chronic terrorism, frequent military conflict, a huge defense burden, a
dearth of physical natural resources, and the need to integrate people
arriving from scores of different countries and cultures. Ironically,
this dramatic transition from low-development status to today\'s very
high level took place largely despite economic policies that were, in
many cases, designed to prevent growth and efficiency. Economic policy
has been liberalized slowly over time, but this occurred by and large in
the face of governmental reluctance.7 In some cases, especially
regarding the reduction of import protectionism, this was forced upon
the government as part of multinational trade agreements.8]{.underline}
Israeli economic policy has almost always stifled competition; protected
inefficient sectors; allocated resources based on political negotiation,
lobbying, and political power; and suppressed market forces in large
swaths of the economy. This \"reign of pork\"9\-- has included the
maintenance of an enormous bloated public sector, a long series of
bailouts for failed enterprises, high tax rates, and a gargantuan
budget. Economic Cognitive Dissonance Israeli economic success is
disconnected from the every-day economic philosophy of most of the
Israeli public.10 Israelis from all parts of the political spectrum are
devoted to maintaining a near-Scandinavian level of welfare state
benefits.11 Income and wealth disparities are obsessions for a broad
swath of the citizenry, and all parties promise to redress them, often
by means of taxes that will \"soak the rich.\" Most Israelis use the
terms \"capitalist,\" \"privatization\" and \"deregulation\" as
pejoratives while \"socialist,\" or at times even \"communist,\" is
something of a romantic compliment (though one that has also come to
imply a certain naiveté.)12 Both middle-and upper-income Israelis are
highly likely to vote for political parties of the Left, like the
Israeli Labor Party or Meretz, which openly denounce economic liberalism
and romanticize the egalitarianism of socialism.13 Working-class and
low-income Israelis are much more likely to vote for the parties of the
Right and religious parties although these parties are often really
parties of the Left when it comes to economic liberalism. Modern Israel
has essentially always had two electoral parties with respect to
economic doctrine and policy, but they are neither Labor or Likud, nor
even their forbearers, the socialism-light of David Ben-Gurion\'s Mapai
or the quasi-capitalist Revisionists of Ze\'ev Jabotinsky. Rather, one
is a party that believes in maximizing governmental controls over the
economy, suppressing competition, cozying up to industrialists who show
party loyalty, restricting imports through protectionism, and
maintaining as many monopolies and cartels as possible. The other
political party advocates for freer markets, economic liberalization,
free trade, competition, de-politicization of the economy, and reduced
government controls. But the reality is that the party that believes in
maximizing governmental control is whichever of the two large political
parties happens to be in power. The free-market party is whichever of
the two main parties happens to be in the opposition. [Thus to
understand truly the state of economic liberalism in Israel, it is
necessary, first of all, to separate rhetoric from policy. The second
most important thing is to understand the depth of the cognitive
dissonance that characterizes the bulk of Israelis, especially the
political elite, with respect to economic liberalism. The same Israelis
who pine for Scandinavian socialism are masters of innovation and
entrepreneurship. Anti-liberal positions characterize all, or nearly
all, of the party campaign platforms regardless of place on the
right-left political spectrum. For example, there is not a single
Israeli political party that officially favors preserving and expanding
the private medical sector that operates alongside Israel\'s official
state-run and state-directed health system. However, governments headed
by the Likud and the Labor Party have quietly sat back and allowed
private medicine to develop while simultaneously speaking out against it
and its \"social dangers.\"14 In the words of the Israeli Medical
Association,]{.underline} Even those opposing the private medical care
in hospitals don\'t wish to prevent private medicine, and most likely,
prevention would have been against our founding principles, mainly the
right to try and achieve the best for one\'s health.15 In a similar
fashion, the Israeli minimum wage was raised shortly before the 2015
elections. Every single party in the Knesset supported the increase with
the only opposition coming from those who thought it was not raised
enough. A bizarre debate then took place between the mainly Arab
Communist Party (HADASH) and representatives of Habayit Hayehudi Party
(The Jewish Home, usually considered a far-right party), over which of
the two should be recognized as the more enthusiastic and effective
party in promoting the increase.16 While all parties are superficially
opposed to monopolies and cartels and supportive of competition, they
are all equally reluctant to implement effective antitrust policies. In
the last elections, the Labor Party (calling itself the \"Zionist Camp\"
for this vote) ran on a platform explicitly opposing removal of the crop
and production control mechanisms that maintain food prices higher than
they should be. With the exception of a new party run by ex-Likud
politician Moshe Kahlon (who ran on a platform calling for antitrust
initiatives in the Israeli banking sector), the parties generally
avoided spelling out which monopolies and cartels they wanted to see
disbanded. Similarly, none of the parties ran on a platform opposed to
import protectionism, especially for agricultural products. While
Habayit Hayehudi leaders did speak about the need for increased
competition to bring down food prices, its head, Naftali Bennett, had
been minister of commerce in the previous government where he did
virtually nothing to liberalize restrictions on food imports. The main
domestic issue in the 2015 elections was housing inflation. Every single
party spoke out about how troublesome that inflation was while none
offered any concrete plan for reining it in. The only party to propose
anything specific was the Yesh Atid party of Yair Lapid, who served as
minister of finance in the previous Netanyahu government. His proposal
to control housing inflation was a mixture of rent and price controls
plus an exemption from levying value added taxes (VAT) on new-home
buyers. This would have, in fact, increased demand for housing without
changing the supply curve. Allowing people to buy housing without paying
VAT would result in their bidding higher prices for the existing housing
stock. Stagnant supply combined with elevated demand can produce only
one thing. None of the parties ran on a platform to privatize
state-owned lands, state-financed universities, or most other public
holdings. None ran on a platform of expansion of school choice or use of
vouchers. No party ran on a platform of seriously reducing the
dimensions of the Israeli welfare state. Cooking Up Trouble with Gas
Under the pre-2015 Likud government, one of the most important economic
developments in the country\'s history took place involving the huge
reserves of natural gas found off Israel\'s shores. The ensuing policy
debate clearly demonstrated the continuing ambivalence of much of the
country toward economic growth. Israel has conducted oil and gas
exploration ever since its independence. But for many years, it appeared
that such efforts were an exercise in futility, mainly an excuse to
maintain employment of the large staffs at the government-sponsored
exploration companies. Starting in 2010, two substantial natural gas
fields with large reserves, Tamar and Leviathan, were discovered by the
private sector off the Mediterranean coast as well as additional fields
showing promise for future production. The fields are large enough to
turn Israel into a moderate-sized energy exporter and represent a major
windfall for the entire country.17 Instead of forming the basis for some
sort of national festival of energy independence, the discoveries
triggered two major policy debates for the government. The first had to
do with production royalties from the gas fields. To motivate
exploration in the past, the government had always signed generous
contracts promising considerable royalties to any company actually
striking gas, probably never expecting much success. However, once the
magnitude of the recent finds became evident, the government came under
public pressure to revise the agreements in order to capture a larger
portion of the profits for the public purse\--at the expense of the
private-sector exploration companies.18 \"Gas tycoons\" became targets
for populist ire.19 The government set up a public commission to examine
the royalties distribution question, headed by retired Hebrew University
economics professor Eytan Sheshinski. Sheshinski was in a bit of a
quandary because the matter was not really an economic question but
rather a public policy issue: Could the \"sacredness of contract\" of
the original lease agreements be traded off to capture a larger share of
the windfall for the public purse? In the end, Sheshinski proposed a
compromise, which was adopted by the government, and the private sector
discoverers were bullied into compliance.20 It violated the original
terms of the contract from the gas search phase and increased the share
of revenues going to the government. According to Shimon Feinstein, a
professor of geology at Ben-Gurion University: We\'re caught in this
very embarrassing situation where we sold a lease for exploration with
certain conditions, and due to the huge discoveries which were beyond
our imagination, we decided \"Oh, we made a mistake,\" and we are
changing the rules of the game after the game was over.21 No sooner had
the royalties issue been resolved than a different policy issue cropped
up. Initially, it had been expected that the bulk of the natural gas
bounty would be exported for hard currency. But the gas bonanza had
wakened a populist sentiment to keep more of the gas inside the country
supposedly for Israelis\' benefit. Why internal consumption of the gas
was more to Israel\'s benefit than export earnings was never made clear.
Fears of the \"loss\" of resources due to exporting can be found in
other countries, not just Israel. In the United States, there is popular
opposition to allowing \"foreigners\" to use U.S. energy resources or
technologies or to own U.S. real estate. Populists in Israel have been
similarly demanding that the discovered natural gas be kept in reserve
just for local use. Why selling some gas on the world market benefits
Israelis any less than selling Jaffa oranges or computer chips to other
countries is something the opponents of exporting cannot explain. A
larger portion of the gas was then pledged for domestic use, regardless
of export market considerations and returns on investments. Restricting
the ability to export the gas freely means it brings in a lower level of
revenue. It is a populist move designed to award domestic consumers with
unearned and undeserved profits at the expense of national revenues. But
that just opened a different can of worms. Since the portion of the gas
to be piped into Israel for domestic use would be sold by two private
sector corporations, concerns suddenly arose about the exploitation of
the local market by a \"duopoly,\" and Israel\'s antitrust official
became involved.22 Prime Minister Netanyahu wants the whole arrangement
to be exempted from the country\'s antitrust laws.23 The Netanyahu gas
resolution was struck down by the Israeli Supreme Court\--but over a
constitutional issue.24 The deal stipulated that the Knesset would be
barred from changing the regulatory regime covering the gas arrangement
for ten years. The court ruled that the current Knesset cannot limit
what future parliaments might do. At the time of writing, the government
is trying to find a resolution. It is not clear how seriously these
antitrust concerns will be taken. Israel can import natural gas from
other sources besides its own fields if what is charged by the two
domestic marketers is found to be above world market prices. It seems
likely that the subtext to the debate was an expectation that the gas be
sold domestically at well below world prices even though this would be
economically inefficient. A simple solution might be to regulate the
domestic sales price of the natural gas marketed inside of Israel and
then allow the \"duopoly\" to operate overseas as unregulated
entrepreneurs.25 The Knesset approved an arrangement for marketing the
gas inside Israel in September 2015 by a thin majority, but opposition
parties continue to protest and lobby against it. At the time of
writing, the matter is still unresolved and facing litigation. Housing
Inflation and Economic Populism Housing price inflation was the main
domestic issue in the last general election as well as the one before
it. Ironically, housing price inflation is a side effect of Israel\'s
economic success. Housing prices reflect economic wealth, and many
Israelis have become wealthy.26 An important avenue for making the most
of their growing wealth is by upgrading their housing. While not all
Israelis are wealthy, enough are so as to jack up housing prices.
Indeed, housing inflation as an indicator of economic success helps
explain why it is such a difficult matter to resolve. Housing prices can
be brought down fairly easily by making Israelis less wealthy, but that
is hardly likely to be a popular policy prescription. Clearly there are
both supply- and demand-side considerations that affect housing
inflation. Most of the price pressure, however, comes from the demand
side. Another important factor is the Bank of Israel\'s policy in recent
years of keeping interest rates very close to zero, a macroeconomic
monetary policy designed to keep up general economic growth. In
practical terms, such low rates mean that ordinary Israelis can borrow
large amounts of capital to bid on housing, which then drives prices
upward. The Bank of Israel has taken some small steps to reduce these
pressures by imposing regulations on the down payments required to
obtain mortgages (currently at about 30 percent of the purchase price).
But after years of quantitative expansion of the money supply, there are
plenty of Israelis flush with cash who have no problem making that down
payment. There are also factors on the supply side that aggravate price
inflation, and there is room for reform in these matters. Much of the
undeveloped land in Israel is still held by the government, and release
of that land for development purposes would bring down land prices,
which tend to be at least two-thirds of the cost of finished housing.
This might relieve some of the cost pressures, but most remaining
government holdings of undeveloped land are in distant locations, far
from the country\'s urban centers. The government has also tinkered with
modifying building regulations to allow for the construction of taller
buildings and more intensive and dense development, but such changes are
unlikely to be large enough in scale to have a major impact on prices.
Furthermore, many construction materials are still subject to monopoly
and cartel control; breaking these producer groups up could lower
construction costs somewhat. But all these supply-side measures together
are unlikely to fix the housing inflation problem. Yet most of the
solutions offered by the ministers of finance in the current and
previous governments are manipulations that could actually worsen
housing price inflation. Recently, the ministry of finance has proposed
offering government land to contractors at less than full market value,
hoping that the contractors would then pass on the savings to the
consumer in the form of housing units priced below market. Such a
delusion cannot withstand a freshman course in economics: Such
underpricing in the tender will merely be pocketed by the contractors.
If forced somehow to pass it on to home buyers, the windfall will just
be pocketed by the buyers. Housing stock will not be any less scarce or
expensive. As noted above, then-minister of finance Lapid proposed
exempting new home buyers from the value added tax on new housing units.
Never implemented, the measure would simply have increased housing
demand without changing supply. After the 2015 elections, the new
minister, Moshe Kahlon of the newly-established Kulanu (All of Us)
party, proposed increasing taxes on \"investments in housing\" (as
opposed to on housing consumers), presumably to drive \"speculators\"
out of the market.27 But how can the government distinguish between a
housing consumer and a housing investor or speculator? Besides, many
housing investors are also landlords. Driving them out of the market
will only cause rental housing costs to skyrocket more than they have
already as demand will once again outstrip supply. As such, the proposal
would simply siphon off some of the excess housing demand into the
rental market, pricing all but the richest yuppies out of Greater Tel
Aviv altogether. Likud Liberalization: Myths and Reality When Likud took
office for the first time in Israel\'s history in 1977, expectations
were that it would carry out far-reaching economic liberalization and a
dismemberment of the state control system. In fact, very little changed
although an urban legend was born: It claimed that the Menachem Begin
government disbanded Israeli socialism and thrust the country into the
clutches of capitalism under the guidance of Milton Friedman.28 In
reality, Begin had little interest in and even less understanding of
economic policy in general and economic liberalization specifically. The
only real liberalization that was introduced in 1978 was a relatively
minor change in the exchange rate regime, moving to a smoother system of
devaluations and eliminating some of the bureaucratic obstacles for
people who wanted to purchase and hold foreign currency. Yitzhak Shamir,
who succeeded Begin in 1983, had even less patience for and interest in
economic policy. Under him, many of the liberalization measures
regarding foreign currency were reversed. Licenses for purchasing
foreign currency were restored for a while, and a bizarre travel tax was
imposed on any Israeli leaving the country for any purpose. Serious
structural change, particularly in the capital markets, remained elusive
until 1985, prevented as part of the collaboration between the two large
parties, which the previous year formed a national unity government.
Starting in 1985, the financial markets were liberalized; bank savings
were released from government control, and government-provided credit
largely disappeared from the market. The movers in that process were
Yitzhak Modai, finance minister from the Liberal Party within the Likud,
Labor prime minister Shimon Peres, and Bank of Israel governor Michael
Bruno.29 Under later governments\--both Likud and Labor\--some limited
liberalization has indeed been introduced.30 Import protectionism has
been eliminated in large part though there are still complete
prohibitions on the import of many products and in many markets (such as
most fruits and vegetables). Other previously highly-protected markets,
such as textiles and electronics, have lost their tariff and non-tariff
protections. In the government of Ariel Sharon, then-finance minister
Benjamin Netanyahu pushed for and implemented decreases in tax rates,
perhaps his main reform.31 He also raised the retirement age. To his
credit, Netanyahu has begun initiatives to rein in the sabotage of the
seaports by union leaders, some of whom have been implicated in
wide-scale criminal activities and racketeering. There has also been
talk of opening \"private\" seaports to compete with the unionized
official ports, but such undertakings have yet to materialize. One of
Netanyahu\'s main achievements (though the Bank of Israel really
deserves the credit) is price stability, namely a very low rate of
inflation, lower than in the United States and most of Europe.
Unemployment has also remained low by international standards although,
once again, this is less thanks to policy prescriptions and more of a
result of labor market flexibility and efficiency. When people can move
freely from profession to profession and from location to location,
unemployment tends to fall. Economic liberalization has so far remained
largely rhetorical under Habayit Hayehudi, the Likud\'s current
coalition partner, whose platform also contained pro-market reform
slogans. But its leader Naftali Bennett, who served as minister of
economics (previously \"commerce\") in the 2013-15 Netanyahu government,
and as such was in a favorable position to eliminate many
anti-productive policies and institutions, did little to effect such
change. The Semi-Liberal Bottom Line While there has been some progress
in implementing liberal economic policy in Israel, there is still much
work to be done. Protectionism should have been pushed back even further
in recent years as the excess in foreign currency reserves has become a
serious headache for the Bank of Israel, which should have implemented
further import liberalization. Israeli agricultural cartels continue to
struggle to drive food prices ever higher. The uncompetitive banking
sector also remains a cartel today. Organized labor still roils the
economic waters. In its early decades, the country had a notorious
reputation for industrial unrest with countless strikes and industrial
actions led by unions and with the support of the national Histadrut
trade union federation. This situation has improved somewhat over the
years though not as a consequence of government policy; in part, it is
due to the massive growth in high-tech firms, which are almost never
unionized. Crippling strikes still occasionally occur in Israel,
including a general strike called by the Histadrut every year or so
lasting for a few days. The Histadrut also shuts down the airports every
once in a while. Nothing has been done to rein in the electric company
union, another syndicalist powerhouse of extortion. Wages in the Israel
Electric Company remain among the country\'s most inflated, due to union
pressures.32 The uncomfortable truth is that throughout much of the
Israeli political spectrum, economic liberalism remains a term of
disparagement. The Israeli media and much of the political establishment
continue to speak out against \"piggish capitalism,\" by which they mean
capitalism in general and economic liberalism.33 Interestingly, probably
the most outspoken media voice in Israel in favor of economic liberalism
is The Marker, the business supplement of the daily Haaretz, which is
without question the most leftist mainstream newspaper in Israel in its
editorial positions on non-economic issues. This may largely be due to
free marketer Nehemia Strassler running the business pages and
supplements in the paper. One often sees the temptation by the current
Likud government to revert to the government control policies of
yesteryear. Some of these impulses come from its coalition partners but
nevertheless have been implemented under Likud governments. A recent
example is a bizarre law designed to control\--and inflate\--book
prices. Proposals for price and rent controls in the housing market are
also becoming more common. Anti-trust policy continues to be meek and
confused. Attacks against business pyramid structures and concentration
are popular though largely rhetorical at this time. Fiscal constraint
seems to be falling by the wayside, and money supply has grown rapidly
in recent years. More money in circulation is the result of the absence
of fiscal restraint and is the cause of future inflation. Both Likud and
Labor governments have pursued privatization of government-owned
enterprises in a half-hearted and zigzag manner.34 There is actually
some evidence to indicate that Likud was less aggressive about
privatization than Labor in recent decades.35 Netanyahu, who has
dominated Israeli politics in one form or another for the last two
decades, has sometimes been described as a neo-conservative for his
foreign and defense views, especially by left-leaning commentators.36
These commentators also presume he is following neoconservative economic
policies yet most would have difficulties identifying which Likud
economic policies are such. In the 1990s, before Likud\'s return to
power under Netanyahu, a panel on economic policy was set up by
opposition Knesset members. This author was invited to speak to the
group. At one point, frustrated by the inability to get my points
regarding economic liberalization across to the group, I commented
sarcastically that perhaps Likud members should simply stop claiming to
be free marketers and just declare themselves the other socialist party.
Netanyahu was present and chuckled, \"No, we are not a socialist party,
we are a Peronist party.\" Peronism is widely regarded as a form of
corporate socialism or \"right-wing socialism.\" Whether Israel will
become serious about economic liberalization is still in question.

### L/T -- Saudi 

#### Saudi sales are the [linchpin]{.underline} of neoliberalism \-\-- they [prioritize profit]{.underline} and destroy anything in the way -- [empirics prove]{.underline}

in Pittsburgh, March/April 2018, "Loyal Customers Can Be as Naughty as
They Want to Be [Massive arms sales to Saudi Arabia helps fulfill the
neoliberal ideal]{.underline}" National Affairs) //AH

In August of 1945, as the world was winding down from more than a decade
of unrelenting political violence, ceaseless bloodletting and
unprecedented inhumanity, two seasoned but frail political leaders ---
one famous and of international renown, the other obscure and known
primarily to regional rivals --- took place on Egypt's quiet Great
Bitter Lake. Their face-to-face meeting aboard the American destroyer
the USS Quincy produced consequences that still impact politics,
international economics, diplomacy and human rights. The fabled Saudi
monarch Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud left his enigmatic kingdom and for the first
time appeared in front of television cameras and prying international
eyes. For President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, it was a version of a
well-practiced diplomatic mission, but one of unprecedented import. At
the time the meeting was arranged, FDR was at Yalta, along with Winston
Churchill and Joseph Stalin, deciding the fate of a completely
devastated Europe. Roosevelt's hasty departure left his European
colleagues perturbed. Upon hearing news of the president's imminent
departure for the Middle East, Churchill accosted one of FDR's aides and
accused the aging American leader of engaging in "a lot of horseplay!"
But the deed was done, and Roosevelt departed the day after announcing
his impending retreat from the European field of diplomacy. What awaited
him on the calm waters of the Great Bitter Lake, though, would be just
as groundbreaking as the decisions being made at Yalta. Aboard the USS
Quincy, FDR met face-toface with three kings: Ibn Saud, Egypt's King
Farouk (a pliable British puppet of Albanian descent set in place to
preserve London's financial interests in the Suez Canal), and Ethiopia's
Haile Selassie (a self-proclaimed direct descendant of Solomon and the
Queen of Sheba, the latest in an unbroken line of kings and queens
stretching back to the biblical kingdom of Sheba). But the jewel in the
crown was clearly Ibn Saud. One description of the generosity with which
Roosevelt treated him states: According to press secretary Steve Early,
"The President, seated on the forward gun deck of his ship, received the
royal visitors as the crew manned the rails, bugle calls sounded, and
the shrill notes of the boatswain's pipe kept all hands standing rigidly
at attention." [In anticipation of the king's visit, Roosevelt had
decided on an appropriate gift, a DC-3 Dakota, the two-engine
propeller-driven mainstay of U.S. commercial fleets. (Gardner, 2009: 20)
FDR, in return, received a gilded sword rumored to have been worth
\$100,000 in 1945 dollars. And with that, the two men began carving out
a mutually beneficial political and economic relationship that has
existed with uninterrupted intensity for the last 70 years.]{.underline}
[Washington's trumpeted claims to be the global leader in terms of
social justice and the still secretive Saudi regime's documented cases
of horrific human rights abuses has failed to disrupt this relationship,
for no Washington agency or administration has ever applied any
significant pressure on Riyadh to change its ways]{.underline}. [One
wonders how the kingdom, given its blatant double standards before the
law and between the sexes, consistent oppression of its Shi'a minority
and draconian corporal punishment for all manner of minor offences
manages to retain its Most Favored Nation Status as a U.S. trading
partner.]{.underline} With a patently racist immigration policy, with
homosexuality punishable by death (by crucifixion), and with the
criminalization of all forms of political dissent[, why does it not
appear on Donald Trump's list of states banned from entering the U.S.?
In short, if Saudi Arabia is such a habitual abuser of human rights, why
is it still considered a normal state within the international
community? If your answer to any of the above-posed rhetorical questions
was "money," "resources," "oil," or, more pointedly, "the neoliberal
ideal," then you are dead right.]{.underline} In an earlier piece for
Islamic Horizons (Jan.-Feb. 2018; p. 56) I [characterized contemporary
neoliberalism (quoting George Monbiot) as an "unrelenting ideology," the
global manifestation of unrestrained privatization and, more to the
point, the single greatest economic threat to human liberty as we know
it today.]{.underline} Its symptoms are plainly visible: selling the
public sector British Railways to greatly enrich a small number of
people and selling Flint's public water utility to private owners who
immediately cut the amount of corrosion-control treatment in the water
supply to reduce expenditures and vastly increase their own profits. [On
the international stage, it is the unprecedented growth of the arms
industry --- pouring hundreds of billions of dollars and other
currencies into developing newer, deadlier machinery to insert into
political conflicts, investments that are repaid tenfold through bloated
sales to foreign governments that seek military solutions to pressing
foreign and domestic political problems.]{.underline} Neoliberalism,
with its attendant unrelenting privatization and rampant market
creation, has been at the heart of the WashingtonRiyadh relationship
from day one. From this perspective, it would be accurate to describe
FDR as de facto CEO of the Seven Sisters, the 1940s-era oil cartel
comprised of seven ostensibly independent although indelibly
interconnected companies working hard to create and sustain their
respective market share of the exploding petroleum industry. FDR's
clandestine purpose was at best, therefore, multi-faceted. With his
intimate connections to the new global financial capital in New York
City and as the scion of the well-established Roosevelt clan, he was
uniquely situated not just because of his political office, but also
because of his family's well-known business interests. [Transcripts of
the two leaders' conversations in August of 1945 reveal that Ibn Saud
was happy to guarantee robust oil concessions to this American-centric
cartel for an indeterminate period of time. In exchange, FDR vaguely
offered "political support" for the fledgling state. Within a
generation, this promise became a completely laissez faire attitude, a
hands-off policy of complete silence that continues to this day, despite
\$100 billion in U.S. military equipment and training over the course of
the next decade.]{.underline} It is rumored that he also engaged in some
\"family\" business, just as FDR appears to have done. But perhaps
neoliberal practice is simply carried out more blatantly than it was
when FDR met the three kings. Riyadh's moribund brand of Islamic
jurisprudence and social organization and the kingdom's increasingly
grotesque violations of human rights. Compounding this Faustian pact of
cheap gas and zooming company profits, during the Reagan Administration
the U.S. famously began selling military equipment to Saudi Arabia, most
notably the 1986 sale of E-3 Sentry AWACS aerial intelligence aircraft.
Publicly, Israel was much chagrined by this shift of American military
favoritism in the Middle East. Privately, Israel need not have worried,
for there was plenty to go around. Since the 1980s, the U.S. has
doubled-down on this commitment by outfitting Saudi Arabia with the
latest military technology --- all from catalogs displaying the latest
wares from private defense firms based in the U.S. This trend shows no
sign of slowing down. [During his May 2017 two-day official state visit
to the kingdom, one of his first major diplomatic efforts, President
Trump pledged \$100 billion in U.S. military equipment and training over
the course of the next decade.]{.underline} It is rumored that he also
engaged in some \"family\" business, just as FDR appears to have done.
But perhaps neoliberal practice is simply carried out more blatantly
than it was when FDR met the three kings. [Remember that neoliberalism
functions by moving money from public hands into private pockets. Its
architects justify policies that benefit individual firms, families and
trust funds directly by declaring loudly that they do, in fact, serve
the public good. But that's just so much smoke and mirrors designed to
conceal their true motive: profit, profit and more profit. In this
forprofit system of privatized industry, the environmental and human
consequences glibly referred to as "externalities" simply don't exist.
However, they are clearly visible on the long, unbroken tarmac
connecting Washington to Riyadh.]{.underline} When private defense
contractors in the U.S. pack up and send off yet another shipment of
laser guided surface to surface missiles destined for the Saudi
military, they are playing the game by the game's own rules and,
according to the only measure that matters, winning. When those missiles
obliterate civilian encampments in war-wracked Yemen, the resulting
deaths are not mentioned on company balance sheets. Likewise, when the
entrenched Wahhabist state executes a prisoner for political dissent via
public beheading --- since 2014 Riyadh has done this with greater
frequency than even the Islamic State --- this obscenity produces no
meaningful consequences in Washington. Rather, Americans are simply told
that these contracts and diplomatic relationships are in the best
interest of the people. [Architects of the neoliberal ideal in both
countries have been playing this mutually beneficial game for decades
now, funneling oil profits into the hands of ever richer executive
offices while pouring mass casualty weapons into the hands of ideologues
willing to turn them against captive civilian populations at home and
abroad.]{.underline} It is enough to make one wonder aloud whether or
not the two old men sitting on board an American destroyer on that calm
salt lake so many decades ago would do it all over again if they had the
opportunity. Chillingly, I believe we all know the answer to that
question.

### ! -- Cap Good -- Poverty 

#### A less regulated free-market solves poverty -- current regulation is the reason for poverty

**Hathaway 18** (Jesse Hathaway, research fellow, 10/28/18, \"Want to
end poverty? Promote capitalism, not socialism,\" Washington Examiner,
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/want-to-end-poverty-promote-capitalism-not-socialism,
Accessed: 7-23-2019, MWM)

"Can't #endpoverty without ending capitalism," claimed a recent post on
Teen Vogue, an online-only media organ that\'s part of an empire
estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue each
year.

Ironically, Teen Vogue is owned by Conde Nast, a company that wouldn't
exist were it not for capitalism. That should shed some light on the
credibility of Teen Vogue's claim. [The reality is, all attempts to
indoctrinate the youth with failed ideologies aside, that [we need more
capitalism]{.mark} and less socialism [to end
poverty.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Capitalism is an economic system based on]{.mark} the idea of [the
free market]{.mark}. Instead of using central planners and compulsion,
[a free-market]{.mark} economy [harnesses the natural incentives]{.mark}
of millions and billions of individuals to pursue their own
self-interest, [and]{.mark} from these forces it [produces widespread
prosperity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As Adam Smith, the Scottish philosopher known for studying real-world
human behavior and formalizing economics into a science, wrote, "It is
not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that
we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."

Smith's philosophy of enlightened self-interest may sound selfish, but
it's not: Although [the average]{.underline} Teen Vogue [employee gets
what he or she wants]{.underline}, namely money to spend on desires and
necessities, [the employee is also providing a service to Teen Vogue.
Conde Nast gets what it wants]{.underline}, an online platform with
controversial clickbait articles, [and it provides an outlet for
employees to have their work published and for companies to
advertise]{.underline} their products. The various companies paying Teen
Vogue advertising money get exposure to potential consumers.

[[All]{.mark} the [actors are pursuing their own interest without being
forced]{.mark} to do so. And [this results in coop]{.mark}eration [and
benefits]{.mark} for all involved --- [wealth creation, useful
employment, and goods and services]{.mark}]{.underline} that people
want.

[[Socialism]{.mark} is [enforced by gov]{.mark}ernment [and]{.mark} the
[threat of violence]{.mark}. It is a [win-lose proposition and a
zero-sum game.]{.mark} Under socialist regimes, the government uses the
force of the state to take from some and gives to others.
[Capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the other hand, [[creates a win-win
scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}. In any given transaction in a free
market, [[every person]{.mark} involved [believes they
benefited]{.mark}, and they're all correct]{.underline}, or else the
transaction would not happen.

Teen Vogue's preposterous promotion of socialism is even more
hypocritical than that, though. It\'s not just that these calls for more
socialism are being made by entities that couldn\'t exist without
capitalism, but [the [free-market]{.mark} principles they are demonizing
comprise history\'s [only proven way to end
poverty.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[In 1981, 44 percent]{.mark} of the world\'s population was [classified
as living in "extreme poverty,"]{.mark}]{.underline} which means earning
\$1.90 per day or less in wages, according to the World Bank. [[As of
2013]{.mark}, that [number had declined to just 10.7 percent]{.mark}.
This was the [direct result of the transition]{.mark} by many large
countries --- including China, India, and Russia --- [to largely
free-market economies]{.mark} and away from socialism.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [[many countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the
United States, [[cling to]{.mark} suboptimal [big-government
policies]{.mark} and to policies that subject market forces to political
considerations. This is known as \"crony capitalism.\" But although
flawed, this is [still far better than]{.mark} a [full-fledged socialist
system]{.mark}]{.underline}, which would cause poverty to skyrocket.

[[If people]{.mark} truly [want to end poverty]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
and they should --- [they [should choose the only proven way]{.mark} to
do that]{.underline}, instead of endorsing pie-in-the-sky fantasies and
long-discredited ideologies. [[Big government wealth
redistribution]{.mark} policies are a [main cause of poverty]{.mark}.
People who create and innovate]{.underline}, including the bright minds
behind drawing readers and advertisers to Teen Vogue, [should be
celebrated for providing goods and services that people
want.]{.underline}

[[To end poverty, government needs to get out of the way of the people,
and let the]{.mark} magic of the [free market work, as it has every
single time]{.mark}]{.underline} it's been allowed to do so.

Michigan and Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He was an assistant professor
of finance at Stony Brook University; 4/5/19; \"Dumping Capitalism Won't

It has become fashionable on social media and in certain publications to
argue that capitalism is killing the planet. Even renowned investor
Jeremy Grantham, hardly a radical, made that assertion last year. The
basic idea is that the profit motive drives the private sector to spew
carbon into the air with reckless abandon. Though many economists and
some climate activists believe that the problem is best addressed by
modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, many activists believe
that the problem can't be addressed without rebuilding the economy along
centrally planned lines. [The climate threat is certainly dire, and
**carbon taxes** are **unlikely** to be enough to **solve** the problem.
But **eco-socialism** is probably **not** going to be **an effective
method** of addressing that threat. **Dismantling** an **entire economic
system** is **never easy**, and probably would **touch off armed
conflict** and **major political upheaval**. In the scramble to win
those battles, even the **socialists** would almost **certainly
abandon** their **limitation** on fossil-fuel use --- either to support
military efforts, or to keep the population from turning against them.
The precedent here is the Soviet Union]{.underline}, whose multidecade
effort to reshape its economy by force amid confrontation with the West
led to profound environmental degradation. [The **world\'s climate does
not have several decades** to spare. **Even without international
conflict**]{.underline}, there's [**little guarantee** that **moving
away from capitalism** would **mitigate** our **impact** on the
environment. Since **socialist** leader Evo Morales took power in
**Bolivia**]{.underline}, living standards have improved substantially
for the average Bolivian, which is great. But this has come at the cost
of **[higher emissions]{.underline}**. [Meanwhile, the **capitalist
U.S** managed to **decrease** its per capita **emissions**]{.underline}
a bit [during this same period]{.underline} (though since the U.S. is a
rich country, its absolute level of emissions is much higher). In other
words, in terms of economic growth and carbon emissions, Bolivia looks
similar to more capitalist developing countries. That suggests that
faced with a choice of enriching their people or helping to save the
climate, even socialist leaders will often choose the former. And that
same political calculus will probably hold in China and the U.S., the
world's top carbon emitters --- leaders who demand draconian cuts in
living standards in pursuit of environmental goals will have trouble
staying in power. [The **best hope** for the climate therefore lies in
**reducing** the **tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and
**carbon emissions**. That **requires technology** --- **solar**,
**wind** and **nuclear power**, **energy storage**, **electric cars**
and other vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The best
climate policy plans all involve technological improvement as a key
feature.]{.underline} Recent developments show that the
[**technology-centered approach can work**.]{.underline} A recent report
by Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyzed about [**7000 projects** in
**46 countries**, and found that **large drops in the cost** of solar
power from photovoltaic systems, wind power and lithium-ion batteries
have made utility-scale renewable electricity competitive with fossil
fuels. A **76 percent decline** in the cost of energy for short-term
battery storage since 2012 is especially important.]{.underline} In a
blog post, futurist and energy writer Ramez Naam underscores the
significance of these developments. Naam notes the important difference
between renewables being cheap enough to outprice new fossil-fuel
plants, and being inexpensive enough to undercut existing plants. The
former is already the case across much of the world, which is among the
reasons for an 84 percent decrease in the number of new coal-fired
plants worldwide since 2015. But when it becomes cheaper to scrap
existing fossil-fuel plants and build renewables in their place, it will
allow [**renewables** to start **replacing** **coal** and **gas** much
more quickly.]{.underline} Naam cites examples from Florida and Indiana
where this is already being done. He cites industry predictions that
replacing existing fossil-fuel plants with renewables will be
economically efficient almost everywhere at some point in the next
decade. Electricity is far from the only source of carbon emissions ---
there's also transportation, manufacturing (especially of steel and
cement), home and office heating, and agriculture to worry about. But
[the rapid advance of **solar** **technology** is a huge victory in the
struggle against climate change, because it will allow people all over
the world to have electricity without cooking the planet.]{.underline}
A[nd how was this victory achieved? A combination of **smart government
policy** and **private industry**.]{.underline} Massachusetts Institute
of Technology researchers Goksin Kavlak, James McNerney and Jessika
Trancik in a recent paper evaluated the factors behind the solar-price
decline from 1980 to 2012. [They concluded that from 1980 to 2001,
government-funded research and development was the main factor in
bringing down costs, but from 2001 to 2012, the **biggest factor was
economies of scale**. These economies of scale were **driven by private
industry increasing output**, but with government subsidies helping to
increase the incentive to ramp up production.]{.underline} It's
apparent, therefore, [that **both government and profit-seeking
enterprises** have their **roles to play.** Government funds the
development of early-stage technology and then helps push the private
sector toward adopting those technologies, while **private companies**
compete to **find ever-cheaper methods** of implementation. Instead of
eco-socialism, it's **eco-industrialism**. If there's **any system that
can beat climate change, this looks like it.**]{.underline}

March 23, 2015 --- To say the world has changed a lot in the last
century is a huge understatement. Industrial, medical and social
progress has resulted in unprecedented growth in the world's population
and economy, and that growth has placed tremendous burdens on the
planet's resources. These burdens create problems --- perhaps the most
substantive problems we have faced as a species: from water scarcity and
pollution to climate change, reliable access to nourishing food, and
affordable energy. Here's the thing, though: [where there are problems
to be solved, there's money to be made. And where there's money to be
made, we awaken one of the world's most powerful forces for change:
capitalism.]{.underline} Of course capitalism has played a starring role
in distressing the planet's resources. Historically, the combination of
unchecked industry, a readiness to externalize costs and a relentless
thirst for growth have plundered and polluted the earth. It's not a
debate, but simple fact that our population size and economies cannot
continue on their present trajectories without exhausting the world's
resources. Yet, a rapidly expanding global middle class ---
[increasingly
urbanized](http://ensia.com/infographics/the-global-population-in-2100/)and
[hungry for protein](http://ensia.com/voices/why-diet-matters/) ---
threatens further and accelerating distress. [The hopeful news is that
businesses, with their almost singular focus on economic self-interest,
and governments, motivated by a variety of interests, are beginning to
recognize and address in earnest these inevitable problems. Today, the
businesses that develop practical and affordable solutions to burdened
resource problems will end up being the world's most profitable
companies. No longer can they be considered "sustainability" businesses.
They are everyday businesses with a long view, targeting problems that
are not going away. **That's smart business.**]{.underline} [Burdened
resources have become a strong economic driver for businesses of all
sizes, in all industries everywhere to spend and change --- and one that
will only grow in scope and intensity over time. Too often people have a
narrow view of these solutions, thinking only of solar panels and
windmills. But **solutions are enormously diverse.** The companies that
provide effective solutions to burdened resources will provide superior
risk-adjusted returns to their investors as business and governments
accelerate their solutions spending out of their own economic
self-interest.]{.underline} [And because the products, technologies and
services these companies provide are common solutions to global problems
--- and are therefore exponentially repeatable --- these investments
will have **amplified positive impact** on global resource scarcity
issues.]{.underline} Too often people have a narrow view of these
solutions, thinking only of solar panels and windmills. But solutions
are enormously diverse: They include, among many others, agricultural
drones that monitor soil conditions, smart irrigation technology that
delivers water only where and when it's really needed, more efficient
distributed energy generation and component suppliers that make cars use
less gas. [We face a new reality in which our economic self-interest and
the long-term well-being of the planet are coming into
alignment.]{.underline} As a whole, the human race has a poor track
record when it comes to altruism. Although there are a great many saints
among us who spend --- and even sacrifice --- their lives to help
others, most of us are hard pressed to take care of ourselves and our
families. [We have a much better track record when it comes to investing
money in our own self- interest, which has fueled the unprecedented
innovation, economic and life-expectancy growth of the past
century.]{.underline} In the past, many people who invested in
sustainable solutions were motivated principally by conscience, willing
to accept reduced returns in order to invest their money in a way that
was consistent with their beliefs and convictions --- be they religious,
social or environmental. [Now]{.underline}, however, [we face a new
reality in which our economic self-interest and the long-term well-being
of the planet are coming into alignment. Because we have to face the
reality of burdened resources, **there's money in it.**]{.underline}
Recently, some asset managers have based investments on environmental,
social and governance screening, betting that good corporate citizens
are inherently better-managed companies, which will therefore be more
profitable over time. Increasingly, however, ESG screening is becoming
more pervasive and will likely over time become commonplace, robbing
this sort of screening as a differentiator when making investment
decisions. [The primary goal for investing in sustainable solutions is
to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns. Companies that provide
solutions to the issues of burdened resources will be the recipients of
a massive global spend cycle, no matter one's motivation. The fact that
one's investment is also part of the solution rather than the problem is
worth getting excited about. **Self-interest is what moves
markets.**]{.underline} According to McKinsey's report, [How to make
Green Growth the new
normal](http://mckinseyonsociety.com/make-green-growth-new-normal/), "In
order to mobilize the US\$3 trillion a year that will be needed to build
a resource-efficient growth model, investing in the markets of the
future needs to be seen as possessing superior risk-return
characteristics." [No government subsidy or charity case can move the
needle for long. Only capitalism has the power to retool industries,
reshape economies and rebuild infrastructure across the planet. **It's a
big part of what got us into this mess, but it's also what will get us
out**]{.underline}

with certain segments of the population, particularly young adults who

about socialism as they are about capitalism. Despite a [record-breaking

better take-home pay, and a job for nearly anyone who wants one, our
economic and political systems have failed to solve key problems. When
it comes to promoting clean energy and taking steps to reduce greenhouse
gases driving climate change, Republicans and Democrats agree [steps are
needed](https://cresforum.org/polling/), but too often actionable policy
solutions have been out of reach. [Advocates of change are working
together to develop actionable policy ideas focused around reducing
market barriers, reducing pollution, and increasing economic growth and
justice through free enterprise. Our goal is to speed the vetting and
uptake of policies that achieve better environmental and public health
results through capitalism.]{.underline} After a lost decade, federal
climate policy is being seriously debated again. [In just the past year,
Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have introduced climate
legislation.]{.underline} Unfortunately, the distance between the
proposals is reminiscent of partisan approaches to healthcare reform. At
the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House's proposed
Affordable Clean Energy rule correctly stays within the scope of the
Clean Air Act, but will be challenged in court unless more stringent
targets are established. Congress and the Trump administration can do
better by starting with a proposal that empowers states, municipalities,
and businesses and builds off their mosaic actions, instead of imagining
policies from whole cloth. [There's been a lot of work done already.
Nine northeast and mid-Atlantic states and California have employed
cap-and-trade systems to reduce greenhouse gases for more than a
decade.]{.underline} [Compliance costs were lower than expected, and the
economic and environmental benefits were so great that earlier this year
Democratic and Republican governors and state legislatures pledged to
drive down greenhouse gas emissions further over the next decade.
Separately, more than 3,500 mayors, governors, CEOs, college presidents,
faith organizations, and tribal leaders have moved to similarly track
and reduce emissions in " [We are Still
In](https://www.wearestillin.com/)" commitments.]{.underline} Because
many companies struggle to cut emissions in their own operations, the
purchase of offset credits allows them to compensate for reduced
emissions elsewhere. The tool has proved to be popular and resulted in a
[\$28
million](https://www.forest-trends.org/publications/unlocking-potential/)
voluntary offset credit market. [America's private and public sectors
have made great strides in deploying clean energy and reducing
emissions,]{.underline} but there is currently no way for these
accomplishments to be documented and organized on a single system where
their collective impact can be better understood by investors --- and
our friends abroad. Establishing a voluntary federal framework for
carbon reporting and offset exchange will increase transparency and
accountability, increase investment in clean energy and offsets, and
further decrease U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. [This type of limited
federal effort could help protect investors and maintain fair and
orderly functioning of voluntary carbon markets.]{.underline} State
compliance markets would still need their own enforcement mechanisms.
But for private actors in the voluntary carbon space, the federal stamp
of recognition could crowd-in investment the way that [Energy
Star](https://www.energystar.gov/about/history/major-milestones)
mainstreamed energy efficiency in the early 1990s through a voluntary
program. [Perhaps most importantly, voluntary greenhouse gas emissions
registry and standards for carbon offsets will not invent a new federal
system that attempts to supersede state progress.]{.underline} In short,
the federal government won't dictate how carbon emissions will be
reduced, but [individuals and capital markets will have centralized
access to information from companies that opt in and choose to lead in
this space. A voluntary greenhouse gas emissions registry and standards
for carbon offsets sets up a race to the top for environmental and
economic performance.]{.underline} This proposal for better accounting
and information may not be enough to meet climate change goals. Other
market-driven proposals are being developed that will lower taxes and
other barriers to capital that will further drive investment in
low-polluting or emissions-free technologies. [The marketplace of ideas
must assure a reliable supply of actionable policy solutions for
lawmakers who want to fulfill their election promises in a way that is
good for businesses, consumers, and the environment. To that end, clean
capitalism can bring about the changes needed to address climate
change.]{.underline}

peace of the past 70 years holds.]{.underline} What follows is a

Zack Beauchamp: One story you hear from political scientists for why
there\'s been less [war]{.underline} recently that
[i]{.underline}t\'[s]{.underline} [just less profitable ---countries
don\'t gain very much, economically or politically, from taking over new
land anymore]{.underline}. Does that seem right to you? Steven Pinker:
Yes, it\'s one of the causes. [It\'s the theory of the capitalist peace:
when it\'s cheaper to buy things than to steal them, people don\'t steal
them. Also, if other people are more valuable to you alive than dead,
you\'re less likely to kill them. You don\'t kill your customers or your
lenders, so the arrival of the infrastructure of trade and commerce
reduces some of the sheer exploitative incentives of
conquest.]{.underline} This is an idea that goes back to the
Enlightenment. Adam Smith and Montesquieu extolled it; it was on the
minds of the founders when they built incentives for free trade into the
Constitution. I don\'t think it\'s the entire story of the decline in
war. But I do think it\'s part of the story. There was a well-known
study from Bruce Russett and John Oneal showing [statistically that
countries that engage in more trade are less likely to get into
militarized disputes, and countries that are more integrated into the
world economy are less likely to get into trouble with their
neighbors.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism promotes peace -- it incentivizes nations to cooperate over trade for economic expansion

**Burns '17** (Sarah- PhD at Claremont Graduate University and is a
Professor at Rochester, "The Capitalist Peace: a New Way Forward for
American Foreign Policy")/ly

Scholars have recently discovered Montesquieu's unique capacity to
answer important contemporary questions. As both a classical liberal and
a pluralist he engages with the tension between these two principles.
While he clearly wishes to promote commercial expansion and political
liberalization, he is also a strong advocate for respecting sovereignty
and cultural diversity. [If we can agree that more stability, wealth,
security and rights protections are obvious goods and the U.S. is
ideologically compelled to promote these goods]{.underline}, [how should
we proceed?]{.underline} [One of the least invasive forms]{.underline}
of liberalization [is the promotion of trade relations]{.underline}
among states. Through commerce[, the U.S. can apply pressure on leaders
to create more liberal principles]{.underline}; if not for the sake of
their people, at least [for the sake of economic
development]{.underline}. [By focusing America's desire to promote
liberalization to the **realm of economics exclusively**]{.underline}, I
think [**we reduce the problem caused by** the combination of
**liberalism** and nationalism.]{.underline} Montesquieu calls this
theory doux commerce and currently [scholars refer to it as **Capitalist
Peace Theory**]{.underline}. The theory goes as follows: [As more
nations engage in trade, the number of commercial goods,
increases.]{.underline} [Commerce continuously expands and]{.underline}
if countries facilitate economic freedom, this [increases the standard
of living domestically]{.underline}. Each commercial activity leads to
more, and traders move from one place to another seeking new people to
trade with and new goods to bring back to their country. As they do,
they create communication among people because [the history of commerce
is that of communication among peoples]{.underline}\^ (Montesquieu 1989,
XXI.5). And this, for Montesquieu leads to a gentler form of
enlightenment. [Communication leads to a softening of
mores.]{.underline} This process will necessarily Bcorrupt\^ pure mores,
or any society that has closed itself off to communicating with others.
It corrupts them because interaction gives people the opportunity to
hear about different cultures and different laws. It stops them from
thinking their laws are the best simply. Montesquieu hopes to
demonstrate that we all appeal to the same basic ideals and we simply
access the truth about how human beings should live through the prism of
our particular culture (Howse 2006, 5). [As we communicate with each
other, we begin to develop a fuller picture of how societies
work]{.underline} and through that knowledge begin to see how societies
should work. [This knowledge]{.underline} Bmakes men gentle\^ and it
[makes them more humane]{.underline}, Bonly prejudice causes these to be
renounced\^ (Montesquieu 1989, XV.3). The reason Montesquieu thinks we
are likely to become gentler towards each other is because this is our
natural way of interacting together. [Prior to the existence of society,
man lives peacefully]{.underline} with other humans. He knows he is weak
and this makes him fearful. Recognizing this same feeling in his fellow
creatures, he develops a Bdesire to live in society\^ (Montesquieu 1989,
I.2).7 Once in society he forgets this natural gentleness. Montesquieu,
therefore seeks to return man, as much as possible to his natural form
of co-existence. This is why he advocates [commercial
relations]{.underline}: it [is the most likely to]{.underline} gently
[increase]{.underline} the possibility of [peaceful
relations]{.underline} among people throughout the world. This may
simply make people more respectful of cultural difference, or it may
lead to a change in mores. As more nations engage in trade, the number
of "movable effects" or commercial goods increases. Montesquieu presents
a semi-capitalist portrait of commercial interaction. Unlike
mercantilists who thought of commerce as a zero-sum game, he sees trade
as a means of creating an ever-increasing amount of wealth in the world.
Commerce continuously expands into Bnew branches\^ and these new
branches create new things to trade (Montesquieu 1989, XIX.9). These
exchanges can therefore increase domestic wealth if a state is careful
about its balance of trade. As this increases, the state develops the
ability to Bgive the necessary things to a greater number of its
subjects\^ (Montesquieu 1989, XX.23). Montesquieu thinks this virtuous
cycle should appeal to nations around the world, even those who are
ideologically reluctant. [As they increase their trade with others and
discover its benefits]{.underline},8 [they will be more and more
inclined to focus their energy on increasing trade]{.underline} and may
copy the British in allowing Bits political interest \[to\] give way to
the interests of commerce\^ (Montesquieu 1989, XX.7). This connects
everyone and shifts the focus of all states to the buying and selling of
these goods. It changes what is important because wealth, to everyone,
is at least somewhat important. [The result of this]{.underline} form of
interaction [would be a world that has diverse ethnic, religious and
racial makeup but an international economic system where everyone is
playing by]{.underline} the same rules[: liberal rules.]{.underline}
Despite these differences, [everyone is significantly more
connected]{.underline} together, [and more interdependent causing
leaders and people]{.underline} alike [**to continuously seek stable,
peaceful relations in order to continue to prosper.** This
is]{.underline}, in fact, [somewhat like the world we have
today]{.underline}. If one looks at the chart of countries with high
economic freedom, they are not all Western. The United Arab Emirates,
Jordan, Bahrain, Georgia, Qatar, Columbia---these countries all rank
very high or fairly high on economic liberty. Conversely, Freedom
House---which looks at political liberties and civil rights--- ranks
most of these states as oppressive.

#### Critiques of CPT lack in depth analysis on trade relations before and after conflicts -- only CPT is all encompassing

**Weede ' 19** (Erich- Professor of sociology at the University of Bonn,
Germany, "Peace," The Bonn Handbook of Globality, pp. 1129-1136)/ly

One may summarize the following propositions [under the label
"**capitalist peace**]{.underline}." According to them, [economic
freedom]{.underline} or capitalism[, foreign trade and investment, open
financial markets, or the avoidance of government ownership of
enterprises **contribute to the prevention of war**.]{.underline} [The
capitalist peace also includes a democratic component]{.underline}.
Since democracy requires economic freedom and the prosperity coming with
it, one may regard the democratic peace---wherever it works at all
(among democracies)---as a component of the capitalist peace. [Then
capitalism, free trade, and economic interdependence
contribute]{.underline} in two or three ways [to the avoidance of
war:]{.underline} [directly or indirectly via democracy]{.underline} and
possibly also via common memberships in international organizations.
Admittedly, this argument rests on a compilation of heterogeneous
empirical evidence, some of which still is debatable. [Without
capitalism]{.underline} and the prosperity made possible by it,
[democracy could not be viable.]{.underline} But capitalism does not
only contribute to democracy because of prosperity. [Private
ownership]{.underline} of the press, radio, and TV stations [generates
sources of information for citizens which are not directly controlled by
ruling politicians.]{.underline} Moreover, a prosperous private economy
makes it possible for politicians who have been voted out of office to
find well-paid work, whereas the losers of elections would depend on the
mercy of the winners in socialist economies. Attractive opportunities
for losers who have to give up offices contribute to the fortification
of democracy, because it becomes easier than otherwise for them to
accept a loss of power. "[Peace by free trade" has been the precursor of
the encompassing idea of a capitalist peace]{.underline}. [A large
number of studies confirmed that the risk of conflicts decreases, if two
countries trade a lot]{.underline} with each other. [**Studies which
question war avoidance** by free trade **suffer from** at least one of
the following **defects:**]{.underline} ([1) They **do
not**]{.underline} sufficiently [**control** for **what enables states
to wage wa**r against each other, such as]{.underline} neighborhood or
big [armed forces]{.underline}. For purely geographic reasons, one
should not assume that the risk of war between Sweden and Switzerland is
comparable to the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan. ([2) They **do not
distinguish** between those conflicts]{.underline} which remain
exchanges of threats and those where people are killed.
[(3)]{.underline} Unfortunately, [trade between countries is not
standardized by gross domestic product]{.underline} but by the foreign
trade volume. ([4) **Trade has not been measured** ahead of conflict.
Wherever these defects are avoided, peace is promoted by free
trade.]{.underline} Moreover, **[trade]{.underline}** (standardized by
GDP) [**is no longer the** **only** or]{.underline} even indisputably
the [best **predictor** of those characteristics of
capitalism]{.underline} or the invisible hand which promotes peace.
[**New measures** for free markets]{.underline} or the avoidance of
state-owned enterprises or protectionism [**have established stronger
pacifying effects** of economic than of political freedom]{.underline}.
Even foreign direct investment contributes to the avoidance of war.
[Openness of financial markets and economic freedom]{.underline} as
such---where free financial markets, free trade, and secure property
rights are components of the index---[have a similar
impact.]{.underline}

3.2. Crisis as an element of capitalist social order We hold the view
that [the occurrence of crises in capitalism is not due to it being an
ailing, doomed economic order; nor is it a proof of capitalism\'s
ineptitude for meeting ecological challenges. Instead, we deem that
**crisis is a fundamental element of the capitalist social order that
actually provides a chance for readjusting economic
processes.**]{.underline} Harvey (2011) explains that anything blocking
the circulation and accumulation of capital may pose a threat to the
capitalist system and induce a fundamental crisis. The finiteness of
fossil fuels is a crisis of this kind (McCarthy, 2015). Altvater (2007)
is convinced that capitalism will not be able to overcome this crisis;
therefore, future technologic progress had to be embedded in a
non-fossil, non-capitalist framework. Kallis (2011) also emphasises that
the approach to a steady state (cf. Daly, 1991, Daly, 2005) will
transform the institutional preconditions of property, work, banking,
and distribution to such an extent that in the end, it will be
impossible to still identify them as capitalistic. With regard to
Kallis\' doubts concerning the institutional robustness of capitalism,
Schumpeter points out that [precisely the ups and downs of industrial
development, which are the outcomes of successful innovations\'
intensifying competition, enable progress]{.underline} (Herzog and
Honneth, 2016). As crises therefore represent an immanent part of the
capitalist system, an environmental and resources-related crisis caused
by the capitalistic process does not provide sufficient evidence to
suggest a possible downfall of the capitalistic social order. [The
crisis might even be taken as proof of an economic cycle]{.underline},
if it is regarded as a period of depression between the dwindling fossil
and the emerging regenerative age. Böhm et al. (2012) and McCarthy
(2015) confirm that **[capitalism is capable of overcoming even
fundamental crises, actually using these as starting points of its
further expansion]{.underline}**. Concerning the environmental crisis,
Harriss-White and Harriss (2007) also concede that [the deployment of
renewable energies holds the potential of founding a new form of
capitalism that is characterised by a much lower degree of materialistic
lavishness.]{.underline} Bettini and Karaliotas (2013) emphasise that
[from a neo-liberal point of view, the accusation of capitalism bringing
about a resources-related and environmental crisis does not at all
provoke self-doubts. Rather, **it caused the profitable marketing of
adequate approaches to solutions** in the field of resource depletion
and environmental impacts **to move into economic focus**]{.underline}.
Even Altvater (2007) points out that [the externalised effects of
production and consumption on nature become relevant for companies once
they jeopardise profitability and accumulation.]{.underline} In that
case, **[environmental problems and their solutions can actually be made
part of capitalist logic]{.underline}**. Solomon and Krishna (2011) are
convinced that in order to solve the environmental crisis, it were not
even necessary to achieve further technologic breakthroughs, as the
technologies needed for the remodeling of society towards energy
efficiency were already mature and cost-efficient. Even if capitalism
might be sufficiently robust, [Kallis (2011) still takes the crisis as a
chance to break up obstructive social and political lock-ins that have
hitherto seemed unalterable and have lead into the crisis.]{.underline}
[Yet he does not regard the ability of social and political
transformation to be inherent in the traits of market, but as a
characteristic of a social order orientated towards
degrowth.]{.underline} Certainly, Kallis is right in saying that the
market is hard to control, making a concerted transformation towards
sustainability difficult. Still [his criticism only refers to that form
of capitalism which Schumpeter characterised as trustified capitalism
and which does lead to ecologically problematic lock-in effects. The
criticism cannot, however, be applied to competitive capitalism, which
generates those basic innovations giving rise to the revolutionary
crises]{.underline} described as so fertile by Kallis (2011). [Thus, an
opportunity is provided for alternative social conditions to be brought
about -- but within the capitalist social order -- and for
substantiating these new conditions through further
innovations.]{.underline} Innovations may emerge outside of competition
and market economy, but will then lack the required frequency and force,
as growth represents the most important incentive of innovation
(Wangler, 2013). On the other hand, [a continuous process of innovation
again leads to growth, which may revolutionise the present social
conditions]{.underline}, as Schumpeter states (Herzog and Honneth,
2016). Thereby, [a new combination of the given means of production
within new sites of production emerges, generating new goods, methods,
and markets]{.underline}. Productive resources are applied to hitherto
untested usages while being withdrawn from those usages they served
before (Geels, 2011). What Kallis (2011) terms technological optimism
with regard to the ecological innovative power of capitalism, is
therefore technological realism in the context of Schumpeter\'s
competitive capitalism. Without doubt, innovative boosts on the part of
already established companies are also conceivable and may give rise to
the possibility of maintaining trustified capitalism with its
ecologically precarious structures. An example hereof is the innovation
'Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage', by which the ecological impact of
the emission intensive electrical conversion of coal is being reduced
(Benson and Orr, 2008). [Technological progress may hence stabilise the
existent system of economy and policy that is accountable for the
environmental crisis]{.underline} (Bettini and Karaliotas, 2013). In
Schumpeter\'s view, however, the decisive economic order is competitive
capitalism, which is characterised by the aggressive economic demeanour
of new, innovative enterprises economically challenging the
establishment (Herzog and Honneth, 2016). The start-ups of new
companies, which are inseparably connected with the processes of
innovation, withdraw production goods from the present capitalist system
by underbidding, disturbing the former economic balance that is so
destructive for nature. **[Competition is therefore essential for
overcoming the environmental crisis]{.underline}**. In that respect,
[the concept of 'solidary economics' and its precept of surmounting the
allegedly ruthless principle of competition and emancipating oneself
from the logic of the markets]{.underline} (Embshoff and Giegold, 2008),
**[is counterproductive]{.underline}**, [as the renunciation of
competition impedes the breakup of crusted economic structures, **which
thus continue to harm the environment.**]{.underline} After all, the big
energy providers\' strategy was and is to hold on to the fossil-nuclear
power plant pool for as long as possible, suppressing alternative
concepts of energy supply (Gawel et al., 2012). A radical transformation
of the energy system therefore cannot emerge from the existent
structures, as Schumpeter assesses (Herzog and Honneth, 2016). Instead,
[innovative processes emerge outside of the old major companies until
proceeding to attack the incumbent regime through the rededication of
means of production]{.underline} (Geels, 2011). Innovative marketing
strategies of small and middle scale businesses supplanting cumbersome
large companies play an essential part especially in the field of
renewable energies (Walsh, 2012). In this, [competition is a decisive
element that cannot easily be superseded]{.underline}.

4\. Capabilities of green capitalism [A competitive green capitalism
develops great creativity by its high rate of innovation, which may also
reinvent the relationship between humans and nature.]{.underline} We now
want to exemplify how this might be brought about. Schumpeter holds the
view that [innovation is the result of the capitalistic entrepreneurial
spirit, not the other way round]{.underline} (Herzog and Honneth, 2016).
[Technological and social progress hence are no independent variables
materialising out of thin air, but arise from the logic of the
capitalist process.]{.underline} Meadows et al. (2004) accept that
innovations may relocate the limits of growth, making it possible to
maintain the living standard by continuously reducing the consumption of
crude materials and energy. However, one of the energy system\'s
prevailing deficits is that depleted or not yet tapped resources are
being (re-)obtained based on non-regenerative energy (Schwartzman,
2008), causing capitalistic production to be increasingly energetically
inefficient (Murphy and Hall, 2011). [Overcoming the energy crisis hence
calls for the consideration of thermodynamic principles]{.underline}
(Georgescu-Roegen, 1971, Georgescu-Roegen, 1986; Martinez-Alier, 1987).
Harriss-White and Harriss (2007) see the deployment of renewable
energies as a possibility of limiting the creation of entropy. Kaberger
and Mansson (2001) have shown that innovative resources-saving material
cycles may be possible and economical if they are based on the usage of
the inexhaustible energy of irradiance. [What is promising about this
approach is that, due to research and development, the utilisation of
solar energy becomes more and more efficient and lucrative]{.underline}
(Schmid, 2016). [Moreover, its inexhaustible potential allows for the
exploitation of material resources even from deposits with extremely low
crude material density.]{.underline} On a local level, the utilisation
of solar energy may actually lead to a reduction of entropy (Ebeling et
al., 1998; Kranert and Cord-Landwehr, 2010), as it is the case with the
usage of waste heat of solar thermal power plants for the desalination
of sea water (DLR, 2007). The integration of these capacities into smart
grids and the associated remodeling of every production process to
purely regenerative sources have been detailed in Section 3. [We further
argue that innovation surpasses conceivability.]{.underline} Even Harris
(2010) sees [a particularly high potential in unpredictable
technological innovations to break through economic routine, thus
encouraging further entrepreneurs in issuing their own innovations.
**Capitalism might thereby be provided with the chance to reduce its
ecological exploitation.**]{.underline} [But innovation exceeds strictly
technological aspects and may as well comprise social and institutional
aspects]{.underline} (Arentsen and Bellekom, 2014). [E.g., in the
mobility sector, whose pollutant emissions have significantly
contributed to the environmental crisis, innovations have led to new
features of cargo and passenger transportation.]{.underline} This is
illustrated by the example of car sharing as an innovative life style
(Prettenthaler and Steininger, 1999) or bicycle-sharing schemes in urban
areas (Midgley, 2011). Another representative case is the history of the
ozone hole, which Meadows et al. (2004) describe as a history of civil
success regarding the correction of a severe overshoot. Quite in the
sense of Schumpeter, Meadows et al. (2004) name the 'industry\'s
creative heads' as the crucial problem-solving determinant. [Through the
three innovative boosts 'better insulation', 'reduced toxic substitute
materials', and 'emission-free alternative substances', it will be
possible to rebuild the original density of the ozone layer by the
mid-21st century. Remarkably, **this is realised without abandoning the
existent economic system.**]{.underline} Furthermore, we argue that [it
is realistic to assume growth-oriented, competitive markets in the
future, rather than socio-material conditions beyond them]{.underline},
which, as stated by Van den Bergh (2011) are completely uncertain as of
now (e.g. Harris, 2013: socialist markets). We therefore hold the view
that it is more pragmatic to design future mass markets in an
eco-friendly way. Kallis (2011) rejects the possibility that the wonder
of a dematerialised economy might occur, as improvements of efficiency
were overcompensated by growing consumption. While dematerialisation may
be tantamount to a wonder, researchers still do put effort into
adjusting the materialised economy to ecological compatibility. [One
aspect is the thorough redefinition of nature protection, because
nowadays, nature protection is reduced to the attempt of limiting the
harmfulness of processes and products]{.underline} (Mulhall and
Braungart, 2010). However, due to the potential creation of new mass
markets for more eco-friendly and efficient processes or products, this
strategy holds the danger of actually augmenting unwanted effects
through rebound effects. In this regard, Alcott (2005) points to the
Jevon\'s Paradox which says it is a great error to think that
technologic innovations were going to reduce the consumption of
resources. Polimeni et al. (2015) name the example of the Green
Revolution: the remarkable increase of food production\'s area
efficiency was not at all able to abate the problems of hunger and area
consumption, as consequently, the population greatly increased.
Likewise, a mass market of efficient and eco-friendly products would
again lead to a massive amount of poison and waste, with disposed crude
materials hardly being recycled. The ecological costs then would have to
be externalised, which Sturm and Vogt (2011) regard as strong evidence
of the failure of the market. [The core problem hence lies in the fact
that products are being produced exclusively for the
technosphere]{.underline} (McDonough and Braungart, 2013). E.g., copper
is almost universally applicable to and beneficial for technological
systems, while in biological systems, this material is extremely
poisonous. Thus, the aim must be to design products in a way that makes
them equally usable in biosphere, i.e. subsequent to their technical
usage. [This calls for the development of a combined management of
nutrients for techno- and biosphere. Human ways of living, the processes
and products they are based on, may thereby be employed for the benefit
of nature. The focus must therefore be put on those innovations that
break up the present paradigm of environmental protection by realising
products that create a useful material connection between techno- and
biosphere.]{.underline} [An example of this kind of creative destruction
is the Austrian company Gugler, the first print shop worldwide that
produces printing products free from harmful ingredients and exclusively
with substances that can be biologically recycled]{.underline} (Gugler
GmbH, 2018). E.g., the accruing sludge is returned to biosphere and the
ash of burned printing products can be reused as a fertilizer. [These
conditions provide the possibility of designing economic activities to
be ecologically compatible despite a high resource
throughput.]{.underline}

#### No limits to growth - their models ignore feedback effects. 

**Lynch 16** (Michael, President of Strategic Energy and Economic
Consulting, Director of Asian Energy and Security at the Center for
International Studies at MIT, and a Lecturer at Tufts and Vienna
University. The "peak oil" scare and the coming oil flood. 63-74.)

More recently, [there has been a clamor about \"peak everything\" based
on the idea that, well, everything is finite and we \'re using it up, so
it is \"running out.\"]{.underline} Or at least, production must peak.
Or, as one physicist \[END OF PAGE 63\] points out, eventually human
energy production will generate as much heat as the sun does-eventually
being 1400 years.

Flat Earth

Colin Campbell, in the famed (well, famous in the IEA\'s offices) debate
at the IEA in 1997, compared resource optimists to the conservative
Spanish court that opposed the visionary, Columbus, and has since
referred to those, like Adelman and me, who disagreed with him as
\"flat-earth economists.\" Albert Bartlett later explained that the term
actually meant that economists thought the earth had two dimensions and
thus was infinite, containing equivalently infinite resources.

But [this description **ignores** two important variables: **capital and
knowledge**]{.underline}. [Additional investment can often increase the
production of renewables like agricultural products and nonrenewables
like minerals and oil in the same amount of space, as can **better
tech**]{.underline}nology. [Neo-Malthusians]{.underline} tend to
**[ignore this factor]{.underline}** and argue that the rate of
technological advance (and greater scientific knowledge) has diminished
or disappeared, as described in Chapter 7.

The argument is somewhat specious and relies in part the question of the
finiteness of resources, discussed earlier-or a static measure of
resources and dynamic view of consumption, as in The Limits to Growth.

HOW LONG?

Perhaps the most important factor that raises skepticism is the fact
that at least some [exponential alarmists fear the distant
future]{.underline}. Any number of pundits have looked at long-term
forecasts of economic and/or technological development and characterized
them as foolish. We have no flying cars, nuclear power is not too cheap
to meter, and no one is eating Soylent Green. On the other hand, [most
of these **were not serious forecasting efforts**, but rather
**off-the-cuff remarks**]{.underline} (or the equivalent), [and those
making them were not particularly serious about achieving them within a
specific time frame]{.underline}. And we do eat Soylent Green already;
only we call it tofu and vegemite. (Read the book, it wasn\'t people.)

NEWTON\'S FIRST LAW

[The biggest mistakes]{.underline} have [come from]{.underline} an
apparent source: [**extrapolation** of a trend **endlessly**, as if
there were no feedback or other variables]{.underline} \[END PAGE 64\]
[involved]{.underline}. Jay Forrester, the inventor of Systems Dynamics,
which was used in The Limits to Growth model (and which I have used),
reportedly once said that **[feedback effects]{.underline}** tend to
[**overwhelm** the initial stimuli]{.underline}, which is probably true
in many cases. [Yet]{.underline}, many neo[-Malthusians]{.underline} and
especially peak oil advocates tend to [extrapolate a given trend
endlessly, assuming no feedback effect whatsoever]{.underline}.

Indeed, the first wave of peak oil advocates explicitly argued that no
feedback effect would occur: prices didn\'t affect production or
consumption levels. Technological advances were either unimportant or
had ceased and so could not increase the resource base.

[An **important element** of the fear of exponential growth is the
analysts\' choice of **particularly high** growth rates]{.underline}. As
Figure 4.1 showed, [Ehrlich chose the **highest observed** growth in the
20th century for his calculations, even though it represented the
post-World War II **baby boom** and should have been considered **an
exception**]{.underline}, not the norm. [Similarly,
Bartlett]{.underline}, writing in 1998, [talks about the growth in oil
demand]{.underline} from the 1950s and 1960s [at 7 \[percent\] a
year]{.underline}, which causes a doubling of use every decade, 25
[which sounds alarming]{.underline}, given the arguments about the
difficulty of making a speedy energy transition, [until you realize that
consumption growth dropped to 3% per year in the]{.underline}
19[70s]{.underline} (a doubling time of 24 years), [and]{.underline}
under [**1 \[percent\] per year** in the]{.underline}
19[80s]{.underline} (a doubling period of 75 years), before recovering
to 1.5% in the seven years before his talk (48 years).¶ [This emphasizes
the lack of feedback mechanism used in these simplistic models and how
important they are in the real world]{.underline}.

REAL SCARCITY

Indeed, [the subtext of the fear of resource scarcity is that renewable
resources have repeatedly been the source of problems]{.underline}. In
**[Tainter]{.underline}**\'s The Collapse of Complex Societies, he
[talks about resources as causing the fall of a number of]{.underline}
(mostly) [ancient civilizations; **nearly all** suffered from problems
like **lengthy droughts** and **salt buildup** in irrigated
farmland]{.underline}. 26¶ And similar problems continue today,
especially if you consider endangered species, from rhinos to tuna. In
all cases, these are renewable resources, the very ones that are NOT

### AT: Root Cause

#### Neoliberalism isn't the root cause of arms transfers---export agencies and NGO's prove

**Williardson '13** (Spencer, PhD from the University of Iowa, M.S.
degree in Strategic Intelligence from American Military University,
"Under the influence Of arms: the foreign policy causes and consequences
of arms transfers," University of Iowa Research Online, pp. 5-6, Spring
2013,
<https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4789&context=etd>,
JLin)

[One fundamental problem with the way that arms transfers are treated in
the literature is that they are essentially taken for
granted]{.underline} from a theoretical standpoint. [A brief examination
of two of the main theoretical views within international relations
**illustrates the problem of making theoretical assumptions about the
transfer of weapons based solely on**]{.underline} a set of "isms" (Lake
2011). Here I contrast realism with [**neoliberalism**.]{.underline} For
realists, arms transfers can perhaps make sense because they represent
power, and a way to transfer capabilities that can help to balance
against other powerful states. For most realists, however, balancing
works because alliances are fluid and can be changed as capabilities,
and potential capabilities within a state, change. Arming another state
changes that state's capabilities rather than relying on a relatively
fluid alliance structure to change the balance when the more permanent
capabilities change. This challenges the strict "self-help" assumption
made by many realists and changes the concept of balancing accordingly.
[**Purely economic arguments (from the neoliberal
tradition**,]{.underline} for example) for weapons transfers also
[suffer from similar challenges. If arms transfers are simply a matter
of trade then **there would be no need to set up special export
agencies** within states to monitor and approve those transfers. **There
would not be calls from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and
intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) to control the flow of arms**
between states]{.underline} (Betts 1980; R. Smith and Udis 2003).
[States do trade weapons with other states -- but not freely. The two
largest arms trading states]{.underline} -- the United States and Russia
-- [both have agencies and procedures in place to ensure that arms
trades are more beneficial than harmful]{.underline} to the state. Thus,
[arms occupy a middle territory in the international relations
literature]{.underline} -- they are instruments of "hard power", the
primary currency in the international relations literature -- and yet
they are treated as simply another variable in most international
relations literature. Decision- 6 makers within states treat the sale of
weapons as a significant political act, and most states have a control
agency/mechanism in place to regulate the sale of arms. The foreign
policy reality of arms transfers seems to fall in the middle ground
between the two broad theoretical positions noted above.

### Can't Explain Ukraine/Russia

#### No RC -- Conditions for conflict extend beyond economic motives

Miami, "The Ukrainian Crisis: An Eclectic Analysis," 12-10-2018, Open

[This framework]{.underline}, on its own, as with neorealism, [does not
give enough credence to the social nature of humans, and focuses on the
state and its interests as a unit]{.underline} instead of human
interests and the interaction of societies as a whole. Even if combined
with constructivism, **[neoliberalism then dilutes the focus away from
what Russia and Ukraine are actually engaged in]{.underline}** in this
crisis, which is a fight for survival. [This is a situation which
neorealism explains more effectively through its focus on security as
the main interest of states]{.underline}. Russia is fighting for the
survival of its sphere of influence and its great power status against
perceived Western aggression in Ukraine, and Ukraine is fighting for the
survival of itself as a united state and its territorial integrity
against Russian aggression. Neorealism and constructivism combined are
more effective due to its focus on the human aspect and security as the
main interest of states and societies when explaining the Ukraine
crisis. Another view, contrasting with neoliberalism, and as discussed
in the University of Greenwich Professor Yuliya Yurchenko's Ukraine and
the Empire of Capital, is historical materialism. In her book,
[Yurchenko attempts to explain the Ukraine crisis through an analysis of
its political economy]{.underline} and claims that the influence of a
"authoritarian neoliberal kleptocracy with fascicisation tendencies" is
the source of the current conflict, with the austerity measures that
have had to be applied and the increase of Ukraine's sovereign debt
during Ukraine's adoption of the Western neoliberal ideals of 17
Keohane, Robert O., and Joseph S. Nye. Power and Interdependence: World
Politics in Transition. Boston, MA: Little, Brown and Company, 1977. p.
23-24. 11 free trade and the free market as the basis for "another
Maidan", as dispossessed workers gain ire for their situation, and the
inability of the "kleptocracy" to produce even the basic necessities for
social interaction.18 [This viewpoint, influenced by Marx, assumes a
world where economic factors are the source of all other
circumstances]{.underline}, and where the adoption of neoliberal
institutions and norms will inevitably lead to an ascendant right-wing
and disillusionment of the working class with its leadership.
[This]{.underline} theory, in my opinion, **[does not have enough
explanatory power for the analysis of the crisis as it
stands]{.underline}**. [It]{.underline} totally [ignores the political,
social, and cultural reasons for the current crisis in all the state
actors, including Ukraine]{.underline}. [It makes a crisis
that]{.underline}, in my opinion, [formed from a clash of cultures and a
political need from the Ukrainian people to have a democratic political
system they can control into a purely economic issue]{.underline},
dictated by external factors instead of internal ones. It also ignores
the baser factor mentioned before, that Ukraine and Russia are engaged
in a struggle for survival, which neorealism is more effectively able to
explain on the surface level. [This framework]{.underline}, even if
combined with either of two frameworks applied in this thesis,
**[remains too limited to create a full understanding of the crisis as a
whole]{.underline}**, unable to reconcile the cultural issues internal
to Ukraine and Russia with its own interpretation of the international
system as a system purely influenced by economics and capital.

### Can't Explain HR

#### Neoliberalism is too totalizing and can't explain Human Rights violations

**Moyn 15** (Samuel Moyn, A Powerless Companion: Human Rights in the Age
of Neoliberalism, 77 Law and Contemporary Problems,
https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/16073952/moyn.%20powerless%20companion.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,
2015, pg. 156-160)///PSC

The most plausible explanation for these facts is that [human rights and
neoliberalism shared both a predecessor and a target: a developmentalist
statism that, while certainly present in the welfarist west and
north]{.underline}, found its most famous expressions in Eastern Europe
and the global south. Put differently, [the paired breakthroughs of
human rights and neoliberalism shared common institutional foes and
especially negative conditions as those foes lost prestige]{.underline}.
A national welfarist commitment found across the North Atlantic,
normally defended in collectivist terms, was on the wane just as human
rights and neoliberalism began enjoying success, and the same was even
more true of the developmentalist vocation of the postcolonial
nation-state to prioritize rapid growth, often by pursuing economic
autarky. Without their departure[, it seems hard to imagine that either
international human rights or neoliberal frameworks and policies would
have begun their rapid ascent in the mid-1970s, which gave them a
kindred trajectory against a shared prior background]{.underline}.
[Furthermore, neoliberalism and human rights share key ideological
building blocks.]{.underline} Most obviously, they share a commitment to
the prime significance of the individual, whose freedoms matter more
than collectivist endeavors, even when those are justified on the
grounds that they will generally advance the well-being of individuals.
More controversially, their shared antipathy towards, or at least
suspicion of, the state, and especially the nation-state, also seems
plain, since both reject its moral credentials (even as both rely on its
agency for enacting policy reform). **[Though clearly neoliberalism and
human rights share several negative conditions and ideological building
blocks, the question is whether these common traits obscure much more
than they reveal about the causal interdependence of the two
phenomena---or, more accurately, lack thereo]{.underline}**f. After all,
the general affinities of human rights with market fundamentalism only
go so far. To state the obvious, [for human rights' many partisans, they
are a discourse of hope and reform and have typically been directed at
the totalitarian and authoritarian state.]{.underline} That state
persists in many places today, in response to which human rights
advocates continue to engage in their informational politics without any
conscious commitment to a particular scheme of economic relations (or
perhaps more accurately, with a conscious though frequently separate
commitment to unspecified visions of social justice). [The ongoing
critique of the atrocity, despotism, and misrule of the state in which
the human rights movement overwhelmingly engages hardly amounts to a
grim recipe for rollback of the national welfare state and could not
possibly entail that rollback on its own]{.underline}. And so, very
quickly in the assessment of how human rights have tracked the emergence
of a neoliberal age, one is pushed onto the ground of troubling
chronological simultaneity, negative conditions, and vague descriptive
affinity. All of these perhaps authorize suspicions of weak complicity,
but hardly of more dastardly synergy, between neoliberalism and human
rights. [And in spite of these parallelisms between the two phenomena,
it is an altogether different matter whether the moment of success in
the 1970s that each enjoyed depended on the success of the
other]{.underline}. [There are, in fact, many reasons to doubt that this
is the case]{.underline}. With their scalar novelty as global principles
informing a transnational political movement, [human rights were
resurrected under very specific circumstances]{.underline} from their
entombment in obscure United Nations documents and procedures (including
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 itself and the
international supervision some envisaged on its basis). **[There were
three great causal factors that led to their dissemination outside the
United Nations: (1) the loss of faith in Cold War paradigms of personal
engagement]{.underline}** (and notably the loss of faith in socialism)
**[in favor of a new and putatively "antipolitical" sort of movement;
(2) the rise of human rights as a language of state legitimacy in the
international system, surprisingly sponsored first and foremost by
American Presidents along with some West European leaders; and (3) the
achievement of decolonization, which, from Western capitals, often
seemed to cry out for a new form of rights-based international
supervision that suddenly seemed relevant]{.underline}**.28 For one
episode that suggests that the coincidence of the parallel breakthrough
of neoliberalism with the emergence of international human rights
politics may explain little, consider the example of the southern cone
of the Americas after 1973. Notoriously, General Augusto Pinochet, after
his fall 1973 coup, adopted Milton Friedman as an adviser, and the
neoliberal Mont Pèlerin Society held meetings in Chile. Indeed, Naomi
Klein takes this example as the starting point in her history of
neoliberal "shock."29 In a very brief section of her book, the most
popular history of neoliberalism ever written, Klein takes up how human
rights imposed "blinders" on the relationship between capitalism and
terror.30 Instead, she rightly says, [Amnesty International took a
neutral attitude toward structural matters]{.underline} (like the class
struggle and ongoing counterrevolution Marxists saw) [in order to focus
on an informational politics that merely singled out incontestable state
abuses]{.underline}.31 Marks agrees that "where the effects of
neo-liberal reconstruction began to bite, activists confined their
criticism to the denunciation of abuses, leaving unchallenged the
conditions in which those abuses had become possible."32 [But although
it is true]{.underline} (indeed, centrally important) [that the
coalescence of a new sort of transnational-rights movement in response
to Latin American misdeeds confined itself to state crimes, it is
important to be clear about what is and is not being said. No one
asserts that this early instance of a now-familiar sort of informational
activism was a cause of either the coups themselves or the disarmament
of other sorts of criticism against the misdeeds of Pinochet's
government or other new authoritarian regimes]{.underline}.33 Klein,
unlike Marks, registers clearly why, if contributory blame falls on
human rights optics, it is really only with regard to the regime's
external critics---for, at that point in history, its internal opponents
had no choice but to narrow their focus and ignore the political economy
of state terror. Klein writes, "Every facet of the human rights movement
was functioning under highly restricted circumstances . . . Inside the
affected countries . . . they didn't talk about the political or
economic agendas behind the disappearances because to do so was to risk
being disappeared themselves."34 [Klein could have added that the
coalescence of a transnational human rights movement, for all the price
that movement paid in muting structural critique, functioned in
coalitional ways quite differently from a more divisive revolutionary
politics. But it remains true that the international left was alive and
well, and part of the success of human rights in the 1970s was due to
the left's own failure either to escape savage repression in a range of
countries or to successfully bring together a coalition to denounce
dictatorial misdeeds with equal success as human rights
movements]{.underline}. It is true that Klein concludes that "the human
rights movement also helped the Chicago School ideology to escape from
its first bloody laboratory virtually unscathed."35 Yet the blame it
deserves in this regard seems rather negligible compared to a host of
other forces---including failures and mistakes on the left at what
remained a very open moment in history. Further, as **[Klein
acknowledges, the human rights "movement unquestionably played a
decisive role in forcing an end to the junta's worst
abuses]{.underline}**."36 As for the rest of Klein's book, which
proceeds through the present, nowhere else does it mention human rights
movements (except to rely serially on their information in order to
frame her critique). And in any case, much more interesting than a
debatable causal linkage between neoliberalism and human rights in the
1970s is the two movements' ongoing companionship as they both entered
adolescence in the 1980s and achieved close to full capture of their
respective realms of governance, both on national and international
scenes, in the 1990s. [Even as the transnational left remained alive and
well in the 1970s across the world, in the 1980s and 1990s]{.underline}
(and indeed, through today) huma[n rights frameworks came and continue
to come close to occupying the imagination of reformist-minded
individuals and groups the world over---and thus deserve much larger
causal association with a range of phenomena.]{.underline} (If there has
been "social resilience" in the face of various neoliberal successes
worth emphasizing, the left has not fared as well, in practice and
perhaps in theory too.37) And yet it remains a completely open research
question how exactly to frame the relationship of the human rights
explosion with neoliberal victory, in Latin America and especially
beyond. Was it the same everywhere and all along? I do not think so,
[for the allegation that human rights silenced structural and
"political" criticisms of what amounted to a neoliberal era became much
more valid and convincing only as time went on. But there is still the
work to accomplish to say even that much]{.underline}. As Mary Nolan
cautiously and insightfully puts it, "**[There is no single relationship
between human rights and market fundamentalism across countries and
types of rights]{.underline}**."38 The same observation applies across
time. The history of the initially distant companionship remains to be
written. To me, [it already seems clear that a better way to frame the
relationship between neoliberalism and human rights, at least based on
current research, is in terms of parallel trajectories]{.underline},
with the tragic consequence that (as some of Marks's own brilliant work
implies) structural insight into the root causes of social suffering
went missing at the time that it was badly needed.39 Yet this result
occurred only in small part because human rights became a more
coalitionally successful prism for interpreting and addressing injustice
than other imaginable frameworks. [It is possible]{.underline} (as I
have argued in The Last Utopia) [for the prestige and prominence of
international human rights to be symptomatic of a loss of structural
accounts of social relations without their being causally responsible or
morally culpable for it]{.underline}.40 If such modes of thought have
been lacking due to the "superficiality" of the informational focus of
human rights politics, it is not as if those politics are alone or even
primarily to blame. The failure of a convincing structuralism and the
programmatic aphasia that resulted is the work of many forces, and it is
implausible to believe that either has gone missing thanks primarily to
human rights hegemony. If all of the above holds---and one assumes that
historical coincidence is not necessarily a causal relationship---then
[the analysis becomes much less one about blame]{.underline} (or
excusal) [and much more about the failure of structural modes of
thinking and more activist political strategies to retain widespread
appeal]{.underline}. Human rights look more like a symptom of a much
broader syndrome, and the point of criticizing them changes accordingly.
It becomes about convincing their adherents that, although serviceable
for some tasks (like singling out state abuses), human rights fail at
others, and need to be supplemented by both new frameworks of analysis
and new modes of intra- and transnational activism.

## Alts 

### Alt Fails -- Communism 

#### The alt fails -- communist movements rely on the subjugation of ethnic minority groups to create a homogenized social order -- Mao's China proves.

**Hoddie 19** Matthew Hoddie, Department of Political Science, Towson
University, Towson, MD, USA, "Ethno-politics in the People's Republic of
China", *The Palgrave Handbook of Ethnicity*, 2019,
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-0242-8_147-1

This [tolerance toward minority communities]{.underline}, both in Tibet
and throughout the rest of China, [came to an abrupt end with the
initiation of the mobilization campaigns]{.underline} that some consider
the primary legacies of the Maoist era and that earned Mao his status as
one of the greatest mass murderers in history. [The most
notable]{.underline} of these mobilization campaigns [are the Great Leap
Forward and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Great Leap Forward ([GLF]{.underline}), associated
with the years between 1958 and 1961, [was Mao's mobilization campaign
to initiate rapid economic development]{.underline} in the country
through a reliance on the ingenuity and revolutionary zeal of the
peasantry. As the title of the campaign suggests, [the ambition of the
government was for China to take a giant leap into its economic
future]{.underline} and provide the country with the means to rival the
development of wealthier states.

[The]{.underline} era of the [Great Leap Forward had **disastrous
consequences for China's minority communities**]{.underline}. Earlier
[guarantees of autonomy were disavowed]{.underline} by the CPP and state
with the initiation of the GLF. [Consistent with the characterization of
minority cultures as "primitive," **distinctive minority practices were
now condemned as detrimental to the goal of promoting economic
development**]{.underline}. As a result, [minorities were discouraged
from speaking their own languages, wearing distinctive clothing
associated with their community, or taking time away from work to engage
in prayer]{.underline} (Dreyer 2004, 297--298).

An important element of the GLF was the development of [agricultural
communes]{.underline}. These communes typically [brought together
approximately 5000 families]{.underline} who were [required to work the
land in common]{.underline}. Functions that were once carried out by
individual families, such as child care and the preparation of meals,
were now the responsibility of the collective. **[Members of minority
communities found these communal arrangements to be particularly
difficult to accept as it often required that they compromise their
culture values.]{.underline}** To note one prominent example, members of
Muslim groups, such as the Uyghurs and Kazaks, objected to being served
meals that were not prepared in observance of the dietary requirements
of their religion (Dreyer 2004, 297--298).

It is clear that many citizens resented and resisted the loss of
independence associated with work in the communes, and the often-harsh
working conditions imposed on them in the context of the GLF. [Events in
Tibet serve to represent the exacerbated tensions that emerged between
minorities and the Han during this period]{.underline}. Concerned about
the growing assertiveness of party officials in Tibet, as well as
threats to his own safety, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 and
established a government-in-exile in neighboring India.

Most of [the experiments with management and technology initiated during
the GLF proved a failure]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the
mobilization campaign, [the country experienced widespread famine that
resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of people. These famines did
not spare minority communities; estimates suggest that **thousands of
Tibetans died during this period**]{.underline} (Sautman 2006, 243).

[The]{.underline} Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
([GPCR]{.underline}) serves as the second mobilization campaign that
defines the Maoist era. Initiated in 1966, the GPCR [was Mao's effort to
remove his political rivals]{.underline} from the CCP [and give the
emerging generation]{.underline} of Chinese a revolutionary experience
that would promote [a sense of patriotism and fervor for communist
ideals]{.underline}. Toward this end, Mao encouraged students from high
school and college to abandon their studies and join what were known as
the "Red Guards." Red Guards were assigned the task of identifying the
enemies of communism who promoted ideas and values contrary to the
spirit of the 1949 revolution.

Among the slogans that [Mao articulated]{.underline} during this time
was [the need for society to smash the "four olds"]{.underline} of
ideas, culture, customs, and habit. [Given the]{.underline} common
[perception of minority communities as representative of "primitive"
cultures, **Red Guards understood themselves to have license to
participate in acts of intolerance and brutality against these
groups**]{.underline}. Scholars have documented episodes of violence
targeting minority groups such as the Tibetan, Uyghur, Mongolian, and
Korean communities. [Beyond attacks on citizens, **there was also
damage** and insults **to** the **culture** of these societies through
the destruction of places of worship]{.underline} (such as Buddhist
temples) and cultural symbols (Hoddie 2006, 65--66).

4.4 Shortcomings of the alternatives [Alternatives to the conventional
growth economy have much to offer, but they also face legitimate
criticism, especially regarding their preconditions and the feasibility
of the transition they propose.]{.underline} [The first major, pragmatic
critique of negative and zero growth is that **transition is not very
popular in times of crisis**, and fear of unemployment and a decline in
living standards may be major obstacles to change]{.underline} (Kallis
et al., 2012). van den Bergh (2011) argues that alternative lifestyles
have always existed, but---by definition---are not accepted by the
majority. (However, many now mainstream ideas were once also considered
insignificant, and a period of crisis can be seen as a window of
opportunity for pushing changes through.) Second, Sorman and Giampietro
(2013) warn that [**a transition can only be forced upon societies**,
but---for unspecified reasons---**never achieved voluntarily or through
collective choice**.]{.underline} This approach suggests that [it is
highly unlikely that a negative or zero growth economy will ever arise
voluntarily within cultures that are generally composed of individuals
seeking ever‐higher levels of income and consumption]{.underline}
(Buch‐Hansen, 2018; Hamilton & Denniss, 2005). Third, [a lack of precise
knowledge and successful narratives concerning alternatives is also an
obstacle]{.underline}. Trainer (2010) [claims that transitioning to a
negative or zero growth economy voluntarily is very unlikely if
practical experience is insufficient]{.underline}. Alexander (2013) also
considers the lack of experience and infrastructure to be important
obstacles to the creation of simpler lifestyles (e.g., it is difficult
to exit car culture without the existence of safe and accessible cycle
paths). [Another major critique]{.underline} (based on Maslow\'s, 1954
thesis) [is that voluntary reductions in consumption may be lucrative
and attractive only in wealthy countries where basic needs are already
satisfied, and thus the approach **does not properly address
sustainability problems in low‐income countries**]{.underline}. Thus,
the question of whether "developing" low‐income countries should develop
according to the conventional (or positive) growth paradigm remains
open. For countries which are in a state of overshoot, it can be argued
that negative growth should continue until a "steady‐state" is
reached---that is, when ecological limits are fully observed (e.g.,
Goodland and Daly, 1996)---but from a policy perspective, it is still
difficult to know when this point has been achieved.

### Alt Fails -- Cap Inev

#### Neoliberalism is institutionally embedded -- means it's inevitable

**Cahill 14**---(Damien Cahill, Senior Lecturer in Political Economy,
University of Sydney, Australia, 2014, "The End of Laissez-Faire?: On
the Durability of Embedded Neoliberalism" p119-121)//don

Writing of the constraints imposed upon the ability of member states to
conduct autonomous fiscal and monetary policies by the European Union
(EU), van Appledorn (2009: 26) observes that '**[policy making is
structurally biased towards policies of neoliberal
restructuring']{.underline}**. This prompts recognition that [the
roll-out of neoliberalism]{.underline} has [entailed more
than]{.underline} just [the construction of new institutions to regulate
markets]{.underline} in which corporations have been granted greater
freedoms or in which newly privatised entities now operate. Rather,
[it]{.underline} has also [entailed the enactment of **new regulations
that commit states to neoliberal forms of governance.**]{.underline}
These are '**[structurally biased' towards neoliberalism]{.underline}**
[because they provide a framework of rules]{.underline} and obligations
[that privilege]{.underline} and commit [states to neoliberal forms of
regulation]{.underline} and response. While the fiscal and monetary
policy constraints of the European Union provide a clear example of
this, the [structural bias extends]{.underline} beyond the sphere of
European macroeconomic management. It is embodied in various forms of
competition policy, in the EU and beyond, and [in the articles of
the]{.underline} World Trade Organisation ([WTO]{.underline}) [as well
as numerous free trade agreements]{.underline}, **[all of which commit
states to neoliberal forms of governance]{.underline}**. Not only does
this highlight that [actually existing neoliberalism is underpinned
by]{.underline} much [more than fundamentalist neoliberal
ideas]{.underline}, **[it]{.underline}** also **[suggests that a shift
in the ideological adherence of policy makers away from neoliberal norms
is far from a sufficient condition to bring about a shift away from
neoliberal forms of state regulation.]{.underline}** Indeed, as several
authors have observed, the structural bias towards neoliberal policies
gives them a constitutional element (Gill 2001; Nicol 2010).
[The]{.underline} neoliberal [bias is institutionally
embedded]{.underline} in such a way as [to make neoliberal policy norms
part of the rules]{.underline}, principles and precedents [by which
nation-states are governed]{.underline}, [thus]{.underline} effectively
**[constitutionalising neoliberalism]{.underline}**. Nicol (2010: 46)
therefore calls such measures a 'constitutional law protection of
neoliberal capitalism', which draws attention to the ways in which such
regulations limit the policy freedom of states to move in non-neoliberal
directions, irrespective of the ideology or policy preferences of state
elites. The following section will detail key examples of
institutionally embedded neoliberalism which underpin the structural
bias towards, and constitutional nature of, neoliberal policy norms,
before turning to a consideration of the de-democratising tendencies
inherent within such structures and the ways in which they reinforce the
class embedded nature of neoliberalism, privileging not just neoliberal
forms of policy, but the interests of the owners and controllers of
capital as well. [The constitutionalisation of
neoliberalism]{.underline} [occurs at both the national and
supranational levels]{.underline}. At the supranational level
[neoliberalism has been]{.underline} [institutionally embedded and
constitutionalised via states joining]{.underline} or making [legally
binding commitments]{.underline} to supranational economic institutions
[including]{.underline} the **[IMF, World Bank, WTO, European Union,
EU]{.underline}** [and various multilateral trade agreements
such]{.underline} as the North American Free Trade Agreement
(**[NAFTA]{.underline}**). The mechanism by which neoliberalism becomes
embedded through these institutions varies, with the former two
institutions -- the IMF and World Bank -- providing a less durable form
of institutionally embedded neoliberalism than the latter agreements,
treaties and supranational governance bodies. The contrast between the
IMF and the WTO provides a good example of this differential durability.
Both have their origins in the post-World War Two era, as key
institutions for regulating the international political economy during
this period. Moreover, both were later transformed into institutions
which facilitated the expanded reproduction of neoliberalism. However,
differences in the membership, applicability and enforcement of the
rules of each organisation are at the heart of differences in the ways
in which each contributes to the expanded reproduction of neoliberalism.
[The IMF facilitates the institutional embedding of neoliberalism
through the conditions attached to the loans it brokers for
nation-states]{.underline}. That this **[supranational
organisation]{.underline}** **[requires states to implement a range of
neoliberal institutional transformations]{.underline}** as a condition
of access to finance means that, in such states, [neoliberalism becomes
state policy irrespective of the ideological disposition of state
elites]{.underline}. Thus, neoliberal policy norms are institutionally
embedded within the conditional lending rules of the IMF.

#### Capitalism is inevitable and their evidence mischaracterizes liberalism -- it's all propaganda

**Mises Institute 18** (Mises Institute, 9/26/18, \"The Myth of the
Failure of Capitalism,\" Mises Institute,
https://mises.org/library/myth-failure-capitalism)///PSC

[The nearly universal opinion expressed these days is that the economic
crisis of recent years marks the end of capitalism]{.underline}.
Capitalism allegedly has failed, has proven itself incapable of solving
economic problems, and so mankind has no alternative, if it is to
survive, then to make the transition to a planned economy, to socialism.
[This is hardly a new idea. The socialists have always maintained that
economic crises are the inevitable result of the capitalistic method of
production and that there is no other means of eliminating economic
crises than the transition to socialism]{.underline}. If these
assertions are expressed more forcefully these days and evoke greater
public response, it is not because the present crisis is greater or
longer than its predecessors, but rather primarily because today public
opinion is much more strongly influenced by socialist views than it was
in previous decades. 1. [When there was no economic theory, the belief
was that whoever had power and was determined to use it could accomplish
anything.]{.underline} In the interest of their spiritual welfare and
with a view toward their reward in heaven, rulers were admonished by
their priests to exercise moderation in their use of power. Also, [it
was not a question of what limits the inherent conditions of human life
and production set for this power, but rather that they were considered
boundless and omnipotent in the sphere of social affairs]{.underline}.
The foundation of social sciences, the work of a large number of great
intellects, of whom David Hume and Adam Smith are most outstanding, has
destroyed this conception. One discovered that [social power was a
spiritual one and not]{.underline} (as was supposed) [a material and, in
the rough sense of the word, a real one]{.underline}. And there was the
recognition of a necessary coherence within market phenomena which power
is unable to destroy. [There was also a realization that something was
operative in social affairs that the powerful could not influence and to
which they had to accommodate themselves, just as they had to adjust to
the laws of nature.]{.underline} [In the history of human thought and
science there is no greater discovery]{.underline}. If one proceeds from
this recognition of the laws of the market, [economic theory shows just
what kind of situation arises from the interference of force and power
in market processes]{.underline}. The isolated intervention cannot reach
the end the authorities strive for in enacting it and must result in
consequences which are undesirable from the standpoint of the
authorities. Even from the point of view of the authorities themselves
the intervention is pointless and harmful. Proceeding from this
perception, if one wants to arrange market activity according to the
conclusions of scientific thought --- and we give thought to these
matters not only because we are seeking knowledge for its own sake, but
also because we want to arrange our actions such that we can reach the
goals we aspire to --- one then comes unavoidably to a rejection of such
interventions as superfluous, unnecessary, and harmful, a notion which
characterizes the liberal teaching. It is not that liberalism wants to
carry standards of value over into science; it wants to take from
science a compass for market actions. [Liberalism uses the results of
scientific research in order to construct society in such a way that it
will be able to realize as effectively as possible the purposes it is
intended to realize]{.underline}. [The politico-economic parties do not
differ on the end result for which they strive but on the means they
should employ to achieve their common goal]{.underline}. The liberals
are of the opinion that private property in the means of production is
the only way to create wealth for everyone, because they consider
socialism impractical and because they believe that the system of
interventionism (which according to the view of its advocates is between
capitalism and socialism) cannot achieve its proponents\' goals. The
liberal view has found bitter opposition. But **[the opponents of
liberalism have not been successful in undermining its basic theory nor
the practical application of this theory]{.underline}**. They have not
sought to defend themselves against the crushing criticism which the
liberals have leveled against their plans by logical refutation; instead
they have used evasions. [The socialists considered themselves removed
from this criticism, because Marxism has declared inquiry about the
establishment and the efficacy of a socialist commonwealth
heretical]{.underline}; they continued to cherish the socialist state of
the future as heaven on earth, but refused to engage in a discussion of
the details of their plan. The interventionists chose another path. They
argued, on insufficient grounds, against the universal validity of
economic theory. Not in a position to dispute economic theory logically,
they could refer to nothing other than some \"moral pathos,\" of which
they spoke in the invitation to the founding meeting of the Vereins für
Sozialpolitik \[Association for Social Policy\] in Eisenach. Against
logic they set moralism, against theory emotional prejudice, against
argument the reference to the will of the state. [Economic theory
predicted the effects of interventionism and state and municipal
socialism exactly as they happened]{.underline}. [All the warnings were
ignored]{.underline}. For 50 or 60 years the politics of European
countries has been anticapitalist and antiliberal. More than 40 years
ago Sidney Webb (Lord Passfield) wrote, it can now fairly be claimed
that the socialist philosophy of to-day is but the conscious and
explicit assertion of principles of social organization which have been
already in great part unconsciously adopted. [The economic history of
the century is an almost continuous record of the progress of
Socialism]{.underline}.2 That was at the beginning of this development
and it was in England where liberalism was able for the longest time to
hold off the anticapitalistic economic policies. Since then
interventionist policies have made great strides. In general [the view
today is that we live in an age in which the \"hampered economy\" reigns
--- as the forerunner of the blessed socialist collective consciousness
to come]{.underline}. Now, because indeed that which economic theory
predicted has happened, because the fruits of the anticapitalistic
economic policies have come to light, a cry is heard from all sides:
this is the decline of capitalism, the capitalistic system has failed!
[Liberalism cannot be deemed responsible for any of the institutions
which give today\'s economic policies their character]{.underline}. I[t
was against the nationalization and the bringing under municipal control
of projects which now show themselves to be catastrophes for the public
sector and a source of filthy corruption; it was against the denial of
protection for those willing to work and against placing state power at
the disposal of the trade unions, against unemployment compensation,
which has made unemployment a permanent and universal phenomenon,
against social insurance, which has made those insured into grumblers,
malingers, and neurasthenics, against tariffs]{.underline} (and thereby
implicitly against cartels), against the limitation of freedom to live,
to travel, or study where one likes, against excessive taxation and
against inflation, against armaments, against colonial acquisitions,
against the oppression of minorities, against imperialism and against
war. It put up stubborn resistance against the politics of capital
consumption[. And liberalism did not create the armed party troops who
are just waiting for the convenient opportunity to start a civil
war]{.underline}. 2. **[The line of argument that leads to blaming
capitalism for at least some of these things is based on the notion that
entrepreneurs and capitalists are no longer liberal but interventionist
and statist. The fact is correct, but the conclusions people want to
draw from it are wrong-headed.]{.underline}** These [deductions stem
from the entirely untenable Marxist view that entrepreneurs and
capitalists protected their special class interests through liberalism
during the time when capitalism flourished but now, in the late and
declining period of capitalism, protect them through
interventionism]{.underline}. This is supposed to be proof that the
\"hampered economy\" of interventionism is the historically necessary
economics of the phase of capitalism in which we find ourselves today.
But **[the concept of classical political economy and of liberalism as
the ideology]{.underline}** (in the Marxist sense of the word) **[of the
bourgeoisie is one of the many distorted techniques of
Marxism]{.underline}**. If entrepreneurs and capitalists were liberal
thinkers around 1800 in England and interventionist, statist, and
socialist thinkers around 1930 in Germany, the reason is that
entrepreneurs and capitalists were also captivated by the prevailing
ideas of the times. In 1800 no less than in 1930 entrepreneurs had
special interests which were protected by interventionism and hurt by
liberalism. Today the great entrepreneurs are often cited as \"economic
leaders.\" Capitalistic society knows no \"economic leaders.\" Therein
lies the characteristic difference between socialist economies on the
one hand and capitalist economies on the other hand: in the latter, the
entrepreneurs and the owners of the means of production follow no
leadership save that of the market. [The custom of citing initiators of
great enterprises as economic leaders already gives some indication that
these days it is not usually the case that one reaches these positions
by economic successes but rather by other means]{.underline}. [In the
interventionist state it is no longer of crucial importance for the
success of an enterprise that operations be run in such a way that the
needs of the consumer are satisfied in the best and least expensive way;
it is much more important that one has \"good relations\" with the
controlling political factions, that the interventions redound to the
advantage and not the disadvantage of the enterprise]{.underline}. A few
more marks\' worth of tariff protection for the output of the
enterprise, a few marks less tariff protection for the inputs in the
manufacturing process can help the enterprise more than the greatest
prudence in the conduct of operations. [An enterprise may be well run,
but it will go under if it does not know how to protect its interests in
the arrangement of tariff rates, in the wage negotiations before
arbitration boards, and in governing bodies of cartels. It is much more
important to have \"connections\" than to produce well and
cheaply]{.underline}. Consequently the men who reach the top of such
enterprises are not those who know how to organize operations and give
production a direction which the market situation demands, but rather
men who are in good standing both \"above\" and \"below,\" men who know
how to get along with the press and with all political parties,
especially with the radicals, such that their dealings cause no offense.
This is that class of general directors who deal more with federal
dignitaries and party leaders than with those from whom they buy or to
whom they sell. [Because many ventures depend on political favors, those
who undertake such ventures must repay the politicians with
favors]{.underline}. [There has been no big venture in recent years
which has not had to expend considerable sums for transactions which
from the outset were clearly unprofitable but which, despite expected
losses, had to be concluded for political reasons.]{.underline} This is
not to mention contributions to non-business concerns --- election
funds, public welfare institutions, and the like. [Powers working toward
the independence of the directors of the large banks, industrial
concerns, and joint-stock companies from the stockholders are asserting
themselves more strongly]{.underline}. This politically expedited
\"tendency for big businesses to socialize themselves,\" that is, for
letting interests other than the regard \"for the highest possible yield
for the stockholders\" determine the management of the ventures, has
been greeted by statist writers as a sign that we have already
vanquished capitalism.[3 In the course of the reform of German stock
rights, even legal efforts have already been made to put the interest
and well-being of the entrepreneur, namely \"his economic, legal, and
social self-worth and lasting value and his independence from the
changing majority of changing stockholders,]{.underline}\"4 [above those
of the shareholder]{.underline}. With the influence of the state behind
them and supported by a thoroughly interventionist public opinion, the
leaders of big enterprises today feel so strong in relation to the
stockholders that they believe they need not take their interests into
account. In their conduct of the businesses of society in those
countries in which statism has most strongly come to rule --- for
example in the successor states of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire ---
they are as unconcerned about profitability as the directors of public
utilities. The result is ruin. [The theory which has been advanced says
that these ventures are too large to be run simply with a view toward
profit. This concept is extraordinarily opportune whenever the result of
conducting business while fundamentally renouncing profitability is the
bankruptcy of the enterprise]{.underline}. It is opportune, because [at
this moment the same theory demands the intervention of the state for
support of enterprises which are too big to be allowed to
fail]{.underline}. 3. It is true that socialism and interventionism have
not yet succeeded in completely eliminating capitalism. If they had, we
Europeans, after centuries of prosperity, would rediscover the meaning
of hunger on a massive scale. [Capitalism is still prominent enough that
new industries are coming into existence, and those already established
are improving and expanding their equipment and operations]{.underline}.
All the economic advances which have been and will be made stem from the
persistent remnant of capitalism in our society. [But capitalism is
always harassed by the intervention of the government and must pay as
taxes a considerable part of its profits in order to defray the inferior
productivity of public enterprise.]{.underline} The crisis under which
the world is presently suffering is the crisis of interventionism and of
state and municipal socialism, in short the crisis of anticapitalist
policies. Capitalist society is guided by the play of the market
mechanism. On that issue there is no difference of opinion[. The market
prices bring supply and demand into congruence and determine the
direction and extent of production. It is from the market that the
capitalist economy receives its sense. If the function of the market as
regulator of production is always thwarted by economic policies in so
far as the latter try to determine prices, wages, and interest rates
instead of letting the market determine them, then a crisis will surely
develop.]{.underline}

#### Neoliberalism is inevitable -- it is ideologically embedded in society

**Cahill 14**---(Damien Cahill, Senior Lecturer in Political Economy,
University of Sydney, Australia, 2014, "The End of Laissez-Faire?: On
the Durability of Embedded Neoliberalism" p119-121)//don

NEOLIBERALISM AS ELITE IDEOLOGY Chapter 2 illustrated the extent of
neoliberalisation across the capitalist world since the 1970s. As
numerous scholars have shown, **[part of this process of
neoliberalisation has been a convergence of state policy practices and
major party platforms around neoliberalism]{.underline}**
(FourcadeGourinchas and Babb 2002; Shields 2007; Belloc and Nicita 2011;
Mudge 2011; Horsfall 2013). For example, [Mudge's]{.underline} (2011:
365) [survey]{.underline} of the policy platforms [of]{.underline}
[major parties]{.underline} [across **51 countries**]{.underline} (OECD,
central and eastern Europe and Israel) from the 1970s until 2004
[found]{.underline} that **['\[m\]ainstream parties neoliberalised their
programs across the Western world after the 1970s']{.underline}**. Such
parties: [increasingly empha]{.underline}sised that the **[state's
responsibilities were primarily market supporting]{.underline}**, with
punitive intervention when necessary: education, work, and the law and
order rather than welfare protections. [Parties]{.underline} also
increasingly [described]{.underline} the [means by which the state
should act in market centric ways]{.underline}. (Mudge 2011: 358) To
note there has been convergence is [not]{.underline} to say that [all
capitalist states have become identical]{.underline}. Conversely, the
mere presence of [differentiation]{.underline} among states [is not
evidence against neoliberal convergence]{.underline}, as some have
suggested (Haupt 2010). [Rather, this is more satisfactorily explained
by the uneven process of neoliberalisation]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [is]{.underline} significantly [conditioned
by]{.underline} the [inherited institutional architecture]{.underline}
of any given nation-state (Fourcade-Gourinchas and Babb 2002). It is in
this sense that it is proper to speak of the uneven geographical
development of neoliberalism and of variegated neoliberalism (Brenner et
al. 2010; Macartney 2011). While the timing and articulation with
inherited institutions and social relations varies by country, the
neoliberal processes of privatisation, deregulation, marketisation,
corporatisation and those pertaining to macroeconomic policy have become
the dominant framework for policy making across capitalist states
globally (Gamble 2009). **[Neoliberalism is not only
dominant]{.underline}** within political parties and among members of
Parliament, but also [within bureaucracies, including]{.underline} the
[supranational lending organisations that have been so important in the
expanded reproduction of neoliberalism]{.underline} (Pusey 1991;
Chwieroth 2007). In Chapters 2 and 3 it was shown that neoliberal
normative theories were not the key driving force for the neoliberal
transformation of states and economies. However, while [neoliberal
ideas]{.underline} did not cause the neoliberal policy revolution, they
have [played an important role in its expanded
reproduction]{.underline}. Indeed, [the foundational principles of
neoliberal theory]{.underline} [provide an important discursive
framework that guides thinking]{.underline} about the desirable course,
nature and scope of policy [making in capitalist economies]{.underline},
particularly among political elites. [This]{.underline} discursive
[frame provides a]{.underline}n economic and philosophical
[justification for neoliberal policies]{.underline}, casting the
neoliberal policy revolution as a rational and almost inevitable
response to the logic of market forces, [as well as casting alternatives
to neoliberalism as unrealistic and]{.underline}/or
[romantic]{.underline} and opponents of neoliberalism as motivated by
ideology or narrow self-interest. Within this discursive frame: The
market is equivalenced as the sphere of economic freedom, while the
state is signified as the embodiment of illusory, and ultimately
coercive, political freedom. [The notion of a self-contained individual
subject is privileged, **ontologically and
epistemologically**]{.underline}, [while invocations of a collective
subject]{.underline} (the 'social', the 'public good', and so on) [are
regarded with suspicion.]{.underline} The market is valorized as the
means of individualized ends, while the misplaced -- however well
intentioned -- politics of social purpose or collective ends is
equivalenced with rationalistic, statist fallacies. This neoliberal
identity is then skilfully equivalenced, rhetorically, with the identity
of the common man/woman (as opposed to a more accurate identification
with the powerful elites that have most to gain from the expansion of
market freedoms), while statism or socialism is equivalenced with the
identity of elitist, unrepresentative, and 'know all' intellectuals.
(Phelan 2007: 33--4) [The]{.underline} internal [logic of neoliberal
theory allows it to]{.underline} [act as a highly malleable discourse
for justifying actually existing neoliberalism]{.underline}. Much like
the neoclassical economics with which it shares conceptual roots,
**[neoliberal theory is unfalsifiable from the point of view of its
adherents]{.underline}**. As Varoufakis (1998: 341) notes
**[neoclassical 'theories are so structured that no observation can
contradict them']{.underline}**, [**since** the
**predictions**]{.underline} of neoclassical theory **[are embedded in
its axiomatic assumptions]{.underline}**. **[This is also true of
neoliberal theory]{.underline}**, which means that the following
conclusion reached by Foley (2004: 341) about neoclassical economics,
also applies to neoliberalism: [**'\[n\]o** **accumulation of its
empirical anomalies or demonstration of its logical inadequacies will
somehow magically dispel \[its\] power'**]{.underline}. As noted in
Chapter 3, neoliberal theory has an ambiguous stance with respect to the
proper role of the state -- something that is particularly evident in
the work of Hayek. Both of these features allow phenomena that appear to
contradict neoliberalism's foundational principles or predicted effects,
to be explained away as the product of exogenous interferences,
incorrect application of the theory, or as being justified, given the
unique set of prevailing circumstances. This type of reasoning is
described by Dean (2008: 56) with respect to 'free trade': According to
the fantasy of free trade, everybody wins. If someone loses, then, this
simply indicates that trade was not free. Someone cheated, didn't play
by the rules. Someone had secret information, the benefits of insider
knowledge or advantages of an unfair monopoly. None of this is to
suggest that those for whom this neoliberal discursive frame constitutes
part of their common sense conception of the world have necessarily
read, imbibed nor fully understood the key canonical texts of neoliberal
theory. Indeed, [it is not necessary for someone to have read any of the
works of Hayek, Friedman, Buchanan or Becker for them nonetheless to
interpret the economy and economic policy through the neoliberal
discursive frame]{.underline}. Rather **[such frames are circulated
through neoliberal think tanks]{.underline}**, **[significant sections
of the mainstream media as well as being privileged by the institutional
architecture]{.underline}** through which neoliberal policy practices
are embedded, as discussed in Chapter 6. Moreover, to the extent that
the work of Hayek, Friedman and other key neoliberal intellectuals is
specifically drawn upon, it is often cherry picked or selectively
appropriated so as to support one's favoured policy option or historical
narrative.

### Alt Fails -- Transition Wars

#### Capitalism disintegration causes transition wars \-\-- three distinct scenarios

[A senior European Commission economist has warned that a Third World
War is an extremely "high probability" in coming years due to the
disintegration of global capitalism. In a working paper published last
month, Professor Gerhard Hanappi argued that since the 2008 financial
crash, the global economy has moved away from "integrated" capitalism
into a "disintegrating" shift marked by the same sorts of trends which
preceded previous world wars.]{.underline} Professor Hanappi is Jean
Monnet Chair for Political Economy of European Integration --- an
European Commission appointment --- at the Institute for Mathematical
Models in Economics at the Vienna University of Technology. He also sits
on the management committee of the Systemic Risks expert group in the
EU-funded European Cooperation in Science and Technology research
network. In his new paper, Hanappi concludes that global conditions bear
unnerving parallels with trends before the outbreak of the first and
second world wars. Key red flags that the world is on a slippery slope
to a global war, he finds, include: the inexorable growth of military
spending; democracies transitioning into increasingly authoritarian
police states; heightening geopolitical tensions between great powers;
the resurgence of populism across the left and right; the breakdown and
weakening of established global institutions that govern transnational
capitalism; and the relentless widening of global inequalities. [These
trends, some of which were visible before the previous world wars, are
reappearing in new forms. Hanappi argues that the defining feature of
the current period is a transition from an older form of "integrating
capitalism" to a new form of "disintegrating capitalism", whose features
most clearly emerged after the 2008 financial crisis.]{.underline} For
most of the twentieth century, he says, global capitalism was on an
"integrating" pathway toward higher concentrations of transnational
wealth. This was interrupted by the outbreaks of violent nationalism
involving the two world wars. After that, a new form of "integrated
capitalism" emerged based on an institutional framework that has allowed
industrialised countries to avoid a world war for 70 years. [This system
is now entering a period of disintegration. Previously, fractures within
the system between rich and poor were overcome "by distributing a bit of
the gains of the tremendous increase of the fruits of the global
division of labour to the richer working classes in these nations."
Similarly, international tensions were diffused through transnational
governance frameworks and agreements for the regulation of capitalism.
But since the 2008 financial crisis, wealth distribution has worsened,
with purchasing power for the middle and working classes declining as
wealth becomes even more greatly concentrated.]{.underline} Growth in
the Western centres of transnational capital has slowed, while formerly
sacrosanct international trade agreements are being torn to shreds. This
has fuelled a reversion to nationalism in which global and transnational
structures have been rejected, and 'foreigners' have been demonised. As
global capital thus continues to disintegrate, these pressures escalate,
particularly as its internal justification depends increasingly on
intensifying competition with external rivals. [While integrated
capitalism depended on a transnational institutional framework that
permitted "stable exploitation on a national level", Hanappi argues that
"disintegrating capitalism" sees this framework become disaggregated
between the USA, Europe, Russia and China, each of which pursues new
forms of hierarchical subordination of workers.]{.underline}
Disintegrating capitalism, he explains, will resort increasingly to
"direct coercive powers supplemented by new information technologies" to
suppress internal tensions, as well as a greater propensity for
international hostilities: "The new authoritarian empires need
confrontation with each other to justify their own internal, inflexible
command structure." [Great power conflict Hanappi explores three
potential scenarios for how a new global conflict could unfold. In his
first scenario, he explores the prospect of a war between the three most
prominent military powers: the US, Russia and China. All three have
experienced large increases in military spending since the collapse of
the Soviet Union. Despite a dip for the US since 2011, President Trump
has ushered in a new spike, while Russian spending has plateaued and
Chinese expenditures are rapidly increasing. All three countries have
also experienced an authoritarian turn.]{.underline} Drawing on game
theory, Hanappi argues that the calculus that none of these countries
would be capable of 'winning' a world war may be changing in the
perceptions of the leaderships of these countries. By one estimate,
China has the highest probability of survival at 52 per cent, followed
by the US at 30 per cent, and Russia at 18 per cent. This calculus
suggests that of all the three powers, China might be the most inclined
to escalate direct hostile military activities that challenge its rivals
if it perceives a direct threat to what it sees as its legitimate
interests. The US and Russia in contrast might transfer the focus of
their military activities on more covert, indirect and proxy mechanisms.
In the US case, Hanappi points out: "... the military strategy of Trump
seems to include the possibility to delegate part of local operational
responsibility to close vassals, which receive massive weapon support
from the US, e.g. Saudi Arabia and Israel in the Middle East. Turkey,
one of the strongest NATO branches in the area is a special case. It
seems to have been allowed to destroy an emergent state of the Kurdish
population, which would have been closer to the European style of
governance." There are growing signs of heightened great power tensions
which could erupt entirely by accident or unanticipated provocation into
a global conflict that nobody wants. The US-China trade war is
escalating, while both powers tussle over technology secrets and argue
over China's growing military footprint in the South China Sea.
Meanwhile Trump's massive expansion of the US Navy and Air Force point
to preparations for a major potential conflict with either China or
Russsia. Both the US and Russia have jettisoned a critical nuclear
treaty established since the Cold War opening the way to a nuclear arms
race. North Korea remains unrepentant about its ongoing nuclear weapons
programme while Trump's tearing up of the nuclear agreement with Iran
disincentivises that country from complying with disarmament and
reporting terms. Early last year, a statistical study of the frequency
of major wars in human history found that the so-called 70 years of
'long peace' is simply not an unusual phenomenon indicating an
unprecedented period of peace. The study concluded that there was no
reason to believe that the 70 year period so far would not give way to
another major war. [Small wars, global contagion Hanappi's second
scenario explores the prospect of a series of "small civil wars in many
countries". The ingredients for such a scenario are rooted in the
resurgence of both right-wing and left-wing populism. "Both
variants --- sometimes implicitly, sometimes explicitly --- refer to a
past historical national state form that they propose to return to,"
explains Hanappi. While right-wing populism harks back to the
authoritarian, racist regimes established in Germany and Italy in the
1930s, left-wing populism yearns to return to the model of "integrated
capitalism" that was in place during the first three decades after the
Second World War, and which reacted to the unequalising effects of
capitalism through the 'social net' of the so-called 'welfare state' as
well as various forms of state intervention in the economy alongside
private industry. But the challenge is that "integrated capitalism" is
already engulfed with its own internal contradictions, propelling the
shift toward disintegration.]{.underline} This puts left-wing populism
in a systematically weaker position, as right-wing populism can point to
the multiple failures of "integrated capitalism": the failure to
"overcome class antagonisms", and the failure to "fulfil the promise of
a substantially better life for the majority of people." According to
Hanappi: "The representatives of Integrated Capitalism are discredited
and cannot act as leaders, the movement therefore is forced to
experiment with new forms of national organization. More participatory
forms of democratic organization take more time, and with multiple
social groups involved this weakens this movements strength vis-à-vis
right-wing populism. Furthermore, its vision of an improved national
Integrated Capitalism is handicapped by the fact that many people still
remember its failures, while the song of national glory that right-wing
populism sings refers to an imagined far-away past that no one ever had
seen." In this context, he argues, the potential exists for outbreaks of
national civil war between emerging paramilitary branches of right-wing
and left-wing populist movements, in the context of either movement
adopting state power and coming into conflict with the opposition.
[Hanappi warns of the possibility of a regional or global "contagion"
effect, if these breakdowns occur within a similar time-scale. In that
scenario:]{.underline} "The fluid mobility of national ideological
political entrepreneurs, the creators of populist movements, meets the
rigidity of dire global economic constraints. This is the crash that
provokes local wars." This scenario is also backed by statistical data.
In 2016, a study by Lloyds Insurers found that since 1960 there has been
an increasing frequency in "pandemics" of "political violence contagion"
involving regional and transnational outbreaks of civil unrest within
and among states. The report said that social protest and dissent
against government policies of militarism abroad and neoliberal
austerity at home could act as potential precursors to "contagions" of
violence, along with other risk factors, including "an increase in the
share of internet users", greater urban concentration, increases in
infant mortality, and a growing young population. [Global insurgency of
the poor Hanappi's third scenario parallels the Lloyds study's finding
that in coming years, the world is likely to face a series of "super
strain pandemics" in the form of "anti-imperialist" and "independence
movements", "mass pro-reform protests against national government", and
"armed insurrection" or "insurgency" associated with two particular
ideologies, "Marxism" and "Islamism."]{.underline} According to Hanappi,
the plausibility of this scenario can be found in the "profoundly
divergent trajectories of welfare of poor parts and rich parts of the
world economy." While GDP has continued to grow overall, in the last
three decades income and wealth inequalities within almost every country
have widened, and look set to sharpen further. If this cycle continues,
a coalescence of grievances among the poorest three billion, spurred on
by the interconnectivity of communications in the smartphone era, is
plausible. [Hanappi argues that in reality, global conditions make a
combination of these three scenarios more likely than just one of them.
"Disintegrating capitalism is not a prediction. It already has arrived
and shapes everyday life. The vanishing of integrated capitalism is not
a forecast either. Disintegrating capitalism dissolves capitalism but to
do so it first has to destroy integrated capitalism, its immediate
predecessor."]{.underline} The distinguishing feature of disintegrating
capitalism is its tendency to establish "nationalist and racist
restrictions" designed to exclude "what its leaders define as an
inferior minority" in order to protect capital accumulation for a
parochially-defined narrow national identity. Old integrated capitalist
institutions are abandoned, and new more coercive governance structures
are introduced. In this context, Hanappi concludes that a third world
war will "not necessarily" take place, but carries "a frightening high
probability." To avert it, he suggests, requires the adoption of
effective counter-strategies, such as a global peace movement. Beyond
disintegration: what comes next? Hanappi's diagnosis is insightful, but
is ultimately limited due to his narrow focus on economics. Missing from
his analysis is any acknowledgement of the biophysical crises driving
the disintegration of global capitalism: the ecological and energy flows
by which capitalist economies function --- and thus the natural limits
(or planetary boundaries) they are breaching. However, his concept of
"disintegrating capitalism" --- bringing with it a heightened propensity
for violent conflict --- coheres well with a broader ecological concept
of civilisational decline explored in a recent paper by American
geographer Dr Stephanie Wakefield published in the peer-reviewed
journal, Resilience. Wakefield draws on the pioneering work of systems
ecologist CS Holling, who argued that natural ecosystems tend to follow
an "adaptive cycle" consisting of two phases, "a front loop of growth
and stability and a back loop of release and reorganisation." She points
out that while Holling's work focused on the study of local and regional
ecosystems, there remained the question of whether the idea of the "back
loop" could be applied on a planetary scale to understand the dynamics
of civilisational transition: "Are we in a 'deep back loop' that
presents the same opportunities and crises as the regional back-loop
studies that we have described?" he asked in 2004. Wakefield explores
the idea of the "back loop" of the Anthropocene, signalling a phase
shift in which a particular order, structure and value system
encompassing humanity's relationship with the earth is experiencing a
deep rupture and decline: "The claims to human mastery over the world
are being literally washed away by rising seas and unprecedentedly
powerful storms, while terminal diagnoses of western civilisation
proliferate as quickly as fantasies of the end." In this new phase,
there is a parallel between the escalation of environmental crises and
intensifying political disruption. "The list of anthropogenic-induced
tipping points crossed or neared grows: fisheries collapse; biodiversity
loss; the melting of the ice caps and rising seas; 350 ppm and now 400
ppm CO2; anthropogenic nitrogen inputs; ocean acidification and coral
reef bleaching; deforestation... But equally and together with these
processes, since 2011 we are also in an era of riots, revolutions, local
experiments and social movements from left to right that, to the front
loop mind, may look insane, but that are very real." But the parallel
between environmental and political disruption is no accident. Rather,
it is a fundamental feature of what Wakefield calls the "Anthropocene
back loop", a phase of systemic decline which sees the old order
unravelling --- but which simultaneously opens up new possibilities for
the emergence of a new system. "In short one thing would seem clear: we
are not in the front loop anymore," writes Wakefield. "If the front loop
was the 'safe operating space' of the Anthropocene... this complex,
nonlinear 'post-truth' world of fragmentation, fracture, dissolution,
and transfiguration is what I propose we call the Anthropocene back
loop." The front loop, then, is equivalent to the apex of Hanapper's
"integrated capitalism" that emerged after the Second World War and
continued to evolve through a 'golden age' of neoliberal growth from the
1980s to the early 2000s. Since then, we have increasingly witnessed the
eruption of internal contradictions with this 'front loop' of integrated
capitalism, in the form of a trajectory of disintegration which
manifests the "back loop" of systemic-civilisational decline: "The back
loop is our present, the moment of the naming of the Anthropocene (as a
failure), in which the past (front loop) has not disappeared, like
points trailing behind on a line, but is erupting in unpredictable ways
in the present." The phase of disintegrating capitalism, then, is part
of a wider "adaptive cycle" of global capital which now finds itself on
the cusp of protracted collapse. And yet, adopting this systems lens
beyond econometric thinking in a deeper ecological framework allows us
to see more than just the destruction of the old order at play, but
within that very process, the real emergence of unprecedented
possibilities for the emergence of a new 'front loop': "Viewing the
Anthropocene through the adaptive cycle lens, and in particular our
threshold 'now' of scrambled grounds, discombobulated modes of knowing
and being as a back loop, has a number of benefits," suggests Wakefield.
"Chief amongst these is the ability to see the Anthropocene not as a
tragic End or world of ruins, but a scrambling where possibility is
present and the future more open than typically imagined." Wakefield's
repositioning of the human condition within the framework of the 'back
loop' opens up space to envisage this as part of a longer historical
series of civilisational cycles of decline and renewal, in which the
task before us is to embrace our role in activating and enhancing the
possibilities for renewal. This means moving far beyond conventional
'front loop' models of resilience --- adapting stale, broken, extant
political and economic structures to a world of intensifying crisis;
into models of resilience aiming to reinvent and redesign ourselves and
our structures from the ground up: "Instead of accepting the end of
human agency except that of managing crisis --- and rather than
imagining ourselves as victims or managers of the back loop --- I argue
that another possibility exists: deciding for ourselves, locally and in
diverse ways, where and how to inhabit the back loop." Inhabiting
requires more than "fighting against or living in fear" of the back
loop. It requires a degree of acceptance of it, finding one's own place
in it: "to be familiar, comfortable, and involved with it... A habitual,
everyday act of free creation and building." And that requires
recognising that we are moving into fundamentally and literally unknown
terrain, which can only be done by dispensing with the old "modes of
thinking and acting from the fore loop." In the back loop, everything is
up for grabs --- not just old infrastructures, but also political
ideologies and assumed philosophical realities. And so, to respond to
the phase of disintegrating capitalism and the threat of a global war,
more is required of us than old models like the idea of a 'global peace
movement' --- we need an entirely new ethos and practice committed to
the ushering in of a new world: "What the back loop suggests to us is
that the Anthropocene is now a time to explore, to let go --- of
foundations for thinking and acting --- and open ourselves to the
possibilities offered to us here and now. This is an 'unsafe' operating
space because we have passed thresholds already, but also because there
are no blueprints, no transcendents, no guarantees, and no assurances:
the only thing to do is become creators of new values and new answers."
Wakefield's work reminds us that while the dangers of a third world war
are escalating in the Anthropocene back loop of disintegrating
capitalism, the opportunities for renewal, reorganisation and revival
are rapidly emerging. These need to be grasped and activated whether or
not war breaks out. Further, we need to work to sound the alarm,
relentlessly, at all levels to raise awareness of the true nature of the
phase shift we now find ourselves in as a species. Whatever ultimately
emerges, the end is not nigh -- rather, we stand at the unknown dawn of
a new beginning.

### Alt Fails -- Marxist Critical Realism

#### Marxists have no real theory of the political and can't explain the state

Political Marxism [The work of Political Marxists in IR in many respects
served to focus the problem of the international and its relation to the
development of capitalism]{.underline}. Marx and Engels, Benno Teschke
observes, did not 'develop an integrated theory that incorporates the
historical efficacy of international relations into their conception of
the overall course of world history' (2006: 332) and 'this relative
absence of the geopolitical has left a problematic legacy within
Marxism' (2006: 330--331). [A result of the increasing interest of
Marxists in the question of how international relations and capitalism
are to be understood together]{.underline} is, as Hannes Lacher
suggests, that the main issue to be studied has developed: where [the
theorists of classical imperialism were concerned to explain the
changing behaviour of states whose existence was assumed, 'the question
that has emerged as central in recent years is how the existence of an
interstate system in the capitalist epoch can be explained in the first
place]{.underline}' (2002: 148). Surveying the Marxist IR literature
that took inspiration from the so-called State Debate of the 1970s
within Marxism, Lacher suggests that while that approach can explain the
necessity of the state (in the singular) to capitalist society, it
cannot answer the question posed by Fred Halliday (cited in Lacher,
2002: 151): '**[why, if there is a world economy in which class
interests operate transnationally, there is a need for states at
all]{.underline}**. What, in other words, is the specificity and
effectivity of distinct states within a single economic totality?' [The
emergence of the modern form of political multiplicity, the capitalist
international, is therefore a central focus of the thinking of Political
Marxists in IR.]{.underline} The theoretical apparatus deployed is
derived from Robert Brenner, his purported reconstruction of Marx as a
'theory of social property relations'. In Teschke's view, '[the
constitution, operation, and transformation of geopolitical orders are
predicated on the changing identities of their constitutive units.
Social property relations, mediating the relations between the major
classes, primarily define the constitution and identity of these
political units']{.underline} (2003: 7; emphasis in original). In this
framework, 'class conflict remains the primum mobile of history'
(Teschke, 2003: 56[): a dominant class of exploiters extracts surplus
from a subordinate class of producers, and analysis focuses on tracing
the outcomes of the various class strategies of reproduction pursued and
on the struggles between classes over property in the output of the
production process]{.underline}. In line with this approach, Teschke
calls for a conceptual shift from the orthodox Marxist problematic of
'relations of production' to a revised problematic of 'relations of
exploitation', especially in regard to pre-capitalist societies (in this
instance, feudal Europe), because 'a focus on the logic of exploitation
overcomes the danger of conceiving the pre-capitalist "state" and
"economy" as two separate institutional spheres and foregrounds the
class-mediated nexus between political force and economic appropriation'
(2003: 56). This is because, schematically, [in pre-capitalist
societies, the economic and the political were organically connected:
the producers had direct access to the means of production and therefore
the ruling class's reproduction was secured through direct
domination]{.underline}, relations of lordship, what Brenner calls
'political accumulation'; whereas, **[in capitalist society, where the
worker is freed both from direct relations of domination and direct
access to the means of production, the economic and the political are
separated, a regime of absolute private property comes into being, the
purely political state is abstracted from civil society, and individual
capitalists and workers are compelled to pursue 'economic' strategies of
reproduction through the market]{.underline}** (the capitalists having
the advantage of ownership of the means of production). But Brenner's
theoretical construction is wholly inadequate to the depth of the
problem of the political. Examining Brenner's conception of social
conflict, Simon Bromley observes that on [Brenner's account of the
pre-capitalist world of settled agriculture, 'political power "was made
possible by the self-organization of exploiters (lords) precisely so as
to mobilize and monopolize the means of force", such that "the
structures of property rights behind unequal appropriation have been
about --- have been constituted in order to make possible --- the
economic reproduction of some collectivities at the expense or exclusion
of others"']{.underline} (2010: 238; emphasis in original). This means
that, as Brenner conceives it, 'rule was always ipso facto a form of
coercive domination over peasants and other subordinate groups' (2010:
238), economic exploitation enforced by the threat or use of violence.
Bromley is surely correct that this could only constitute an outer
boundary of political life,18 'rather than an adequate characterisation
of the pre-industrial historical record' (2010: 239), the reason being
that **[political community cannot be explained in the terms of simple
opposition between exploiters and exploited]{.underline}**. He cites the
Marxist anthropologist Maurice Godelier to the effect that '**[for
relations of domination and exploitation to be formed and reproduced in
a lasting fashion, they must be presented as an exchange, and as
exchange of services', and that 'not all the services provided by those
who were dominant were purely imaginary or illusory]{.underline}**.
Otherwise the movement which engendered estates, castes, classes and the
state, when that emerged in certain class societies ... would not have
forged ahead' (2010: 238). And Bromley also notes the argument of the
Marxist historian John Haldon, who suggests that ['a crucial element in
the longer-term success of a state formation is a degree of acceptance
of that state as normatively desirable, especially by elites, but even
by the broader populace from which it draws its resources']{.underline}
(2010: 238). The central point is that '**[politics is always about much
more than class domination and exploitation']{.underline}** (Bromley,
2010: 239).19 Indeed, Bromley argues that it is the case that 'at the
root of all organised --- that is, social --- power there is an element
of more or less conventional co-ordination. That is, [there is an
element of social co-operation in all organised forms of social
power.... Some form of co-ordinated collective action lies at the basis
of all enduring exercises of power, however limited the co-operating
sub-group and however much domination is involved in its relationship
with others']{.underline} (2010: 233). The crudity of Brenner's
conception leaves its mark on the work of the IR scholars who draw on
him for theoretical inspiration. In Benno Teschke's more than 300-page
book on the origins of the modern states system, there is a mere one
paragraph (2003: 31) that obliquely touches upon the issue of the
political, only to pass over it immediately: [a work devoted to
debunking the 'myth of 1648' as the seminal moment in the co-genesis of
capitalism and the modern form of political community, the nation-state,
and that attempts instead to demonstrate the absolutist]{.underline}
(and, it is asserted, non-capitalist) [origins of the latter, contains
no substantive theoretical discussion of the concept and meaning of the
political.]{.underline} For all its emphasis on 'attentiveness to
historical specificity and the agency of historically situated actors'
(Teschke, 2008: 184) and rejection of structuralist rigidity, [the
historical sociology of Political Marxism retains a rather simplistic
version of the traditional Marxist mono causal reading of history, class
conflict]{.underline} (rebranded as 'struggles over social property
relations' or 'strategies of reproduction'), [and as a result much else
falls outside its reach]{.underline}.20 While class conflict, strategies
of reproduction and contestation over property rights may in part
explain, at some level, the dynamics of social formations, processes of
change over time and thereby the characteristics of particular eras of
international relations, they surely do not grasp what is involved in
the constitution of political community; rather, they tacitly presuppose
the existence of a structured social space in which those conflicts take
place, and thus cannot reach as far back as to explain what the
political is, and therewith what the international is. **[The ironic
truth is that the Political Marxists have no theory of the
political]{.underline}**.

#### Marxism cannot explain itself absent IR theory

**Davenport 11** (Andrew Davenport, BA, Corpus Christi College,
University of Oxford MA, University of Sussex PhD, "Marxism in IR:
Condemned to a Realist fate?" University of Sussex, UK, DOI:

**[The concept of the political exists as something repressed within
Marxist theorizing, something thought to be long since overcome that yet
persists in making its presence painfully felt.]{.underline}** None of
the leading Marxist approaches extant within IR has sought to subject
the political itself to theory.25 Rather, it appears as an element that
is simply given, immediate. [The consequences can be read in the
entanglement of Marxism, both as theory and practice]{.underline}, in
the historical fate prescribed by Realism, the perdurable fragmentation
and anarchy of international politics. [This failure to inquire into the
meaning and significance of the political is referable back to the
ambivalence of Marx's own theoretical practice]{.underline}. On the one
hand, 'Marx consigned the whole sphere of politics to ideology' (Adorno,
2000: 143). There is a moment of world-historical freedom, not to be
discarded, in this brusquely achieved rupture. The hardened surface of
the social is broken through: no longer is society to be entranced and
deluded, in its self-understanding, by forms of appearance: politics,
law, religion and philosophy. **[Politics]{.underline}** is not, any
more than any of the others, to be hypostasized into something existing
in-itself, something autonomous and self-sufficient, something
ontological. Rather, it **[receives all its substance and contents from
elsewhere, from the societally mediated process of the interaction of
humans with nature: In the whole conception of history up to the present
this real basis of history has either been totally neglected or else
considered as a minor matter quite irrelevant to the course of
history]{.underline}**. [History must, therefore, always be written
according to an extraneous standard]{.underline}; the real production of
life seems to be primeval history, while the truly historical appears to
be separated from ordinary life, something extra-superterrestrial. With
this the relation of man to nature is excluded from history and hence
the antithesis of nature and history is created. [The exponents of this
conception of history have consequently only been able to see in history
the political actions of princes and States, religious and all sorts of
theoretical struggles]{.underline}. (Marx and Engels, 1968: 51) Marx's
historical materialism, dedicated to the primacy of the economic as the
mode of society's self-reproduction, had in the mid-19th century, and
continues to have, a decisively progressive aspect: the founders of
historical materialism 'wished for the revolution as one of the economic
relationships in society as a whole, in the fundament of its
self-preservation, not as the changing of the ground-rules of
domination, its political form' (Adorno, 2001: 'Antagonism
contingent?'). Only such a change in the basis of society's existence
could bring about the world-historical transformation that Marx and
Engels hoped for, the break from pre-history. [The failure of the
revolution of 1848 surely impressed upon Marx the necessity of a better
theoretical grasp of the essence of society: the decades-researched,
never completed study of political economy seeks precisely to lay bare
how it is that modern society actually reproduces itself, what form the
interaction with nature takes in capitalist society, what it means that
the object is a commodity]{.underline}. Yet, at the same time that the
ideological appearance of politics is stripped away by devastating
criticism, [the political itself is left standing; the content of
politics is revealed as arising out of the antagonistic nature of
society's mode of reproduction, the organization of the exploitation of
nature, but the form of the political, the space in which politics takes
place,26 is not subjected to crit]{.underline}ique. If politics is seen
through as appearance, it is nevertheless not explained how the societal
process of the productive interaction with nature generates the
distinctive form of the political that Realism insists upon --- its
delimitation and, on the global level, fractured, multiple existence.
[The critique of political economy can be considered a
quasi-transcendental account of economics --- What are the conditions of
possibility for such a thing as an 'economy' to exist at all? --- but no
such radical questioning is brought to bear on the political element: it
is not explained why economics is political economy]{.underline}. [So
the political itself remains obscure, unillumined by the light of
critique, with the result that the relationship between the categories
derived from the critique of the societal production process and the
political existence of humans remains unarticulated]{.underline}.
Paradigmatically, in the Communist Manifesto Marx and Engels write both
that 'the working men have no country' (2002: 241) and that 'the
struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national
struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all
settle matters with its own bourgeoisie' (2002: 232). The proletariat
both transcends the national context and yet is bound to it in a
relationship that is never properly explicated. '[Since the proletariat
must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the
leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is,
so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the
word']{.underline} (Marx and Engels, 2002: 241; emphasis in original).
But in what sense of the word? [The nation, the modern political
community, remains in Marx's thought the scene of the drama even despite
the sublation of the class struggle]{.underline}. The form of the
political is to be filled with a radically different content, but it is
never made clear whether or how this revolutionary change of content
itself changes the nature of the form.27 Consequently[, despite being
roughly negated]{.underline} (at least as high politics), [the political
continually recurs throughout Marx's oeuvre in a theoretically
undigested way as marking out the space within which revolutionary
activity is to take place]{.underline}, from the early critical works
motivated by the experience of German backwardness in relation to
Britain and France, through the texts on the failure of revolutionary
struggle in France, to the late Critique of the Gotha Programme and
documents for the First International. [The contradiction of
internationalism and national revolution remains latent and unresolved,
indeed unacknowledged]{.underline}.28 This ambivalence towards the
political, its simultaneous negation and retention, is preserved within
the Marxist tradition right through to the various strands of Marxism
within contemporary IR. [The World-Systems theorists and Political
Marxists, for instance, are at an extreme in their refusal to grant any
theoretical substance to the specificity of the political, to how and
why a bounded political space is created, and yet the political is
continually and massively present within their work, at least at a brute
empirical level --- how could it not be, when their studies are entirely
devoted to analysing the differential development of political
communities within the growth of capitalism]{.underline}? The same is
true generally of Marxism within IR: the political is always there
(necessarily, given that so much of IR Marxism takes the form of
historical-sociological studies) but almost invariably as an
unacknowledged element, something regarded as unproblematic, something
not worked through theoretically. **[Where Marxist historical sociology
has broached the question of the political]{.underline}** (Rosenberg,
2010), **[it has been unable to grasp it conceptually; and where,
exceptionally, Marxism has attempted a conceptual
treatment]{.underline}** (Bromley, 2010),29 **[it has effectively
conceded to Realist political fragmentation: 'In respect of political
order ... the Humean predicament is the human
predicament']{.underline}** (Bromley, 2010: 245). But, as a theory of
freedom, **[Marxism cannot afford such a concession; for it is precisely
the form of the political that Realism says creates the anarchic,
unchanging and essentially conflictual arena of the international, and
which forces each community into the fatality of the unending struggle
for self-preservation that is the condition of international
politics.]{.underline}**30 If this deficiency within Marxist thought
concerning political form is traceable back to Marx's own thinking, then
the solution to the problem of the political is not to be
straightforwardly found within the Marxian corpus. [It is necessary,
instead, for Marxism in IR to extend its reach beyond the prevailing
interest in historical-sociological studies of processes of development
and to engage critically with the tradition of political
theory:]{.underline}31 [above all, with such central categories as
sovereignty and legal order]{.underline}. The model for such an
engagement remains, nevertheless, the manner of Marx's own approach to
bourgeois political economy: [he neither rejected the categories
developed by classical political economy in favour of a 'socialist'
alternative, nor did he simply accept them at face value]{.underline}.
Rather, he interrogated them in such depth, exposing their social
mediatedness, as to demonstrate that the political economists did not
understand their own concepts. It is through this labour of conceptual
investigation that Marx broke the naturalization of the categories of
bourgeois society characteristic of political economy.32
[This]{.underline}, also, [is the way to escape Realist essentializing
in IR]{.underline}. [Just as Marx's theory of capital implies the
question of how a society]{.underline}, indeed a world, of generalized
exchange is possible, **[how it is that humans could totalize exchange
such that every object becomes a commodity, an economic thing, so, in
IR, the problem of the political demands investigation into how humans
could make themselves 'sovereign', an autonomous source of law, and how
the world could be transformed into political space]{.underline}**. The
premise of Marx's theoretical investigations is that it is necessary to
understand the being of capitalist society, what it actually is, if it
is to be transcended: only through investigating the conditions of
possibility of the society ruled by value does it become possible to
think what might be beyond universal commodity exchange. [Analogously,
for Marxist thinking in IR, it is only through interrogating the
fundamental categories of political thought, exposing what is involved
in their constitution, that it might be possible to think beyond the
delimited, particularist form of the political naturalized by Realism,
and to escape entrapment in the fateful condition of the
international.]{.underline}

pre-dates its]{.underline}** \[i.e. IR's\] **[formal
establishment]{.underline}** as an institutionalized field of study'
(Teschke, 2008: 163). The founders of historical materialism wrote
extensively on contemporaneous world events, but their interest was
largely one of analysing the tendency of those developments in order to
assess the possibilities of revolutionary political action.
[International relations presented a practical problem rather than a
theoretical one: the contradiction between the national and the
international was registered empirically but not penetrated by
theory]{.underline}.3 This deficiency was not corrected in the Classical
Marxist theories of imperialism developed in the early 20th century.
Certainly, [as the 19th-century expectation of socialist revolution in
Western Europe was confounded and capitalist development reached further
into the periphery and the non-capitalist world, imperialism theory, in
comparison with the international thought of Marx and Engels,
constituted a sustained attempt to link theoretically the dynamics of
international politics to the changing structure of capital accumulation
--- the theorization of imperialism as part of the dynamic of monopoly
capitalism]{.underline}. Further, the Marxist theories of imperialism,
in expectation of the imminence of revolution, pioneered analysis of
events in terms of epoch and conjuncture, a mode of thought that, even
long after the impetus of Marxism as a political movement was exhausted,
has continued to be enormously influential in Marxist thought, eliding,
in the specifically IR context, with conventional historiography and
historical sociology. But, [while imperialism theory had a consciously
international context, still the orthodox tradition of Marxism at no
stage posed the existence of political multiplicity and, correlatively,
the delimited form of the political as themselves worthy of, or
demanding, theoretical reflection]{.underline}. This deficiency
continues to hobble Marxism in IR. With the vertiginous onset of
globalization at the beginning of the 1990s, followed by the turn to a
self-declaredly militarized foreign policy by the leading capitalist
power and the eruption of the world financial crisis in 2007--8, the
continued relevance of the traditions of Marxist thought after the
polarizations of the Cold War and its eclipse as radical theory in the
1980s has sometimes been enthusiastically proclaimed:4 the Communist
Manifesto hailed as announcing globalization avant la lettre and the
foreign policy stance of the Bush administration evidencing, once again,
the perennial necessity of imperialist rivalry to the dynamics of
capitalism. However, **[Marxism's engagement with other theoretical
positions in IR during the same period revealed that the matter was more
complex than a straightforward reaffirmation of traditional Marxist
categories might suggest. The Marxist critique of globalization was to
the effect that]{.underline}**, far from announcing a new dawn of global
integration, **[overcoming inter-state rivalry through the networks of
civil society, promoting human rights and liberal governance, the
phenomenon was best explicated as the latest round of the intrinsically
expansionary dynamics of the capitalist accumulation
process]{.underline}**, with all the unevenness and contradictions that
that necessarily entailed, and that, conjuncturally, the precipitate end
of the Cold War unleashed in the early 1990s forces of capitalist
integration on a global scale that had been accumulating for at least 20
years.5 To a significant extent, [the Marxist account was aligned with
the narrower Realist critique of liberal internationalism in the 1990s,
which doubted whether the new era had surpassed inter-state rivalry,
that is, had radically transformed the nature of international
politics]{.underline}.6 At the turn of the millennium, the stridently
aggressive foreign policy posture of the Bush administration provoked on
the Marxist left a revival of the old theories of imperialism (never
absent from the mainstream of Marxist discourse but here given a shot in
the arm), updated to apply to the new global situation but recognizably
indebted to the Classical Marxist legacy. However, [where the critique
of globalization had indicated common ground with Realism and its
'sometimes splendid demolitions of liberal ideology']{.underline}
(Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2008: 96), [the arguments of the thinkers of
the so-called New Imperialism reveal the cost of any such
accommodation]{.underline}. For, where Lenin and the other early
20th-century thinkers of imperialism had needed geopolitical conflict as
an integral part of the theory because competition between the major
capitalist powers provided the opportunity, the space, for revolution in
the semi-periphery (hence the opposition to Karl Kautsky's theory of
ultra-imperialism), a century later the inevitability of geopolitical
rivalry had been definitively subsumed to the Realist tradition in
international thought. [If the economic reductionism of the old Leninism
could not be maintained, what was to be the status of geopolitics within
any updated concept of imperialism]{.underline}? [This issue has
coalesced with the investigation within Marxist historical sociology of
the specifically international dimension of the process of capitalist
development, the importance within the expansionary dynamic of
capitalism of the fractured, multiple nature of global political space,
to form the question, as posed by Alex Callinicos]{.underline} (2007):
'[Does capitalism need the state system]{.underline}?' Cleaving to the
theory of imperialism yet desiring to avoid its hard economism,
Callinicos proposes7 a conception of 'capitalist imperialism as
constituted by the intersection of, respectively, capitalist and
territorial logics of power and economic and geopolitical competition'
(Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2007: 539); in this way, [the states system,
geopolitics, is to be incorporated non-deductively into the broader
theory of capital, as an independent determination to be introduced as
one moves from Marx's abstract theorization by degrees closer to
reality]{.underline}. The relation between the two logics is apparently
to be conceived of as contradictory and dialectical rather than
functionally one-sided.8 'One implication of this', as Callinicos
admits, 'is that [there is, necessarily, a realist moment in any Marxist
analysis of international relations and conjunctures']{.underline}
(2007: 542). At [a simple analytical level this is, perhaps, reasonable
enough: geopolitical considerations do indeed form part of international
politics and ought therefore to find a place within any causal
account]{.underline}. Beyond that, [however]{.underline}, [all the
important questions remain unanswered]{.underline}. For Callinicos
purports simultaneously to incorporate geopolitics into a theory of
capitalism and to leave it as an autonomous element. Gonzalo Pozo-Martin
is quick to see the problem: '[if the territorial logic of competition
is autonomous, does it follow that we must relinquish an attempt to
explain its determinations from the perspective of historical
materialism?']{.underline} (2007: 554).9 **[Allowing a 'Realist moment'
immediately reopens the painful theoretical gap that Callinicos was
otherwise trying to close, for it leaves the 'territorial logic',
geopolitics, as itself something simply posited and underived: the
theory of capital is supposed to explain why there is a capitalist logic
of competition, but what is to explain why there is a territorial
logic]{.underline}**? In truth, the New Imperialism has done little to
remedy the deficiencies of the older theory regarding the relation
between capitalism and the states system. [Where the earlier theory,
along with its economic reductionism, 'took the nation state as a social
relation in its plural manifestations --- the states system --- as
given, failing to problematize, much less theorize, the fact that nation
states were "relevant units" in the world economy']{.underline}
(Teschke, 2008: 169), the new one, in flight from economism, replaces
this failure with a hypostasization of the territorial logic that the
states system is said to articulate. [The New Imperialism, like the old,
simply assumes the political, qua territoriality --- the very problem
that Realism poses to Marxist theory]{.underline}. Nonetheless, the
debate over the New Imperialism has served to suggest the specific
tension between Marxism and Realism: Pozo-Martin's doubt about
Callinicos's Realist moment, about whether **[Marxism can in any way
afford an accommodation with Realism senses without developing the fact
that Realism, pre-eminent theory of the geopolitical, presents a problem
for Marxist thought, one that is more far-reaching than the latter has
been willing to admit.]{.underline}**

#### Realist thought encompasses the material relations of capitalism

Uneven and combined development In his recent work, [Justin
Rosenberg]{.underline} has arguably gone further than any other Marxist
IR theorist in trying to explicate just what lies behind Realism's
dominance of the discipline, attempting to develop 'an alternative
theoretical framework --- one which has the same intuitive simplicity as
the balance of power, but which enables us finally to recover the lost
history of international relations, breaking with the old theory which
has shown us only an empty, meaningless struggle for power' (Rosenberg,
1996: 6).21 To recover this history, he [has been centrally concerned
with elaborating Trotsky's theory of 'uneven and combined
development',]{.underline} how developmental processes are refracted
through the varying configurations of different social formations,
creating specific and frequently unstable hybrids of combined
development. From the beginning, [Rosenberg has been concerned to push
Trotsky's idea as far as possible, to generate a 'general
abstraction']{.underline} (2006: 319; emphasis in original) [that would
capture a fundamental characteristic of the historical process as a
whole]{.underline}. This evolving theoretical perspective is designed to
incorporate precisely the issue central to Realism, the multiplicity of
political units. Thus, in the course of a critique of Rob Walker's
argument that 'the international', and its attendant dilemmas of inside
and outside, is the product of the peculiarly modern resolution of the
spatial dimension of politics by means of the concept of sovereignty,
Rosenberg proposes a more far-reaching grounding of the 'problematic of
the international' (2000: 65). [Arguing that Walker's reduction of the
international to one of its distinct historical forms constitutes 'an
illicit collapsing of the general into the particular']{.underline}
(2000: 73), [Rosenberg, instead, drawing on Marx's mooted procedure of
concept formation in the 1857 'General Introduction' in the Grundrisse,
argues for a clear conceptual distinguishing of the two, and for a
general abstraction of 'the international']{.underline} (akin to a
general abstraction of 'production' or 'labour'). **[However, at this
point, a discrepancy enters the argument]{.underline}**. Rosenberg notes
that the notion of the international rests on the anterior concept of
political community, and therefore for a general abstraction of the
international to be generated, this concept must first be explicated;
so, 'a successful general abstraction of "the international" presupposes
a prior general abstraction of "the political"' (2000: 77). **[But the
general definition of 'the political' that is then given turns out
already to presume what it is in fact supposed to define: 'the political
dimension of any social order comprises the means which it has
developed]{.underline}** (whatever they may be) **[for arriving at, and
giving effect to, collectively binding decisions and
rules']{.underline}** (Rosenberg, 2000: 78). **[This is a definition of
an aspect internal to political community ('of any social order'), not
of the political itself; it assumes the constituted political space
rather than enquiring into how that space comes into
being.]{.underline}** Nor is there anything in this definition to
suggest why political communities exist in the multiple. Indeed, in
Rosenberg's argument, that aspect is simply empirically derived ---
'given that no social order has ever yet been coextensive with humanity
as a whole' (2000: 79) and 'we need only the empirical assumption
itself: [in the known field of human history, social orders have always
co-existed']{.underline} (2000: 80; emphasis in original). Thus, at this
central point in the argument, the explication of the key concept of
Realist thinking is sidestepped. The critique of Rob Walker stands at
the beginning of Rosenberg's investigation of uneven and combined
development, and he has since unfolded the implications of the term in a
series of articles. But [the issue of the political remains
problematic]{.underline}. In a recent contribution (2010), [Rosenberg
attempts to derive political multiplicity from uneven and combined
development via an appropriation of Barry Buzan and Richard Little's
account of the emergence of the political, and therewith the
international, in the long pre-historical transition from
hunter-gatherer groups to settled and ultimately state
societies]{.underline}. Despite the evident significance of the
historical account, it is clear that what is actually provided is a
series of sociological factors, centred on the development of social
hierarchy, and internal differentiation and complexification, which are
then said to give rise, in a way that is unspecified, to something
designated 'the political'. There is a disjuncture in the argument,
which can only be awkwardly leapt over, not properly bridged: what '[the
political' actually is, what its conceptual specificity is, remains
undetermined and obscure]{.underline}.22 **[The causal sociological
factors are of great importance, but they do not suffice of themselves
to explicate the political]{.underline}**. For that, it would be
necessary to interrogate such categories as sovereignty, autonomy, law
and juridical order, but it is doubtful whether historical sociology is
capable of that register of conceptual inquiry.23 As a result of this
deficit, the reasons Rosenberg provides for the existence of political
multiplicity can again only be functional rather than properly
conceptual, contingent rather than intrinsic: '[since the level of
development of early states does not enable any one of them to engross
the whole of the human world, their hardening inside/outside division
necessarily congeals into finite entities' and 'because the causal range
of social relations and interactions within which they congeal far
outruns ... the reach of any centralized political power, the existence
of these early states is likely to stimulate reactive developments of
social differentiation and proto-state formation beyond themselves,
leading to the emergence of further "political" entities']{.underline}
(2010: 185).24 In the absence of a theorization of the concept of the
political, this approach risks conceding too much to Realism[. For all
that Rosenberg's account, importantly, shows the political and the
international to be historically emergent, the causal, sociological
manner of analysis, focused on processes of development, renders it
incapable of grasping the political qualitatively.]{.underline} It thus
remains caught in the Realist trap: for, if it is not possible to
specify what something is, it is impossible to think what might be
different from it. **[The investigation of the explanatory potential of
the idea of uneven and combined development may well solve the problem
of the Realist]{.underline}** (especially neo-Realist) **[reification of
geopolitics as a domain separable from the wider compass of 'the
social', reconnecting the international to the domestic and thereby
generating a more adequate analytic of social development per se, but it
does so at the expense of effectively naturalizing the Realist concept
of political community, its necessarily 'closed' nature and the
potential for conflict produced thereby.]{.underline}** The
historical-sociological mode of the investigation of uneven and combined
development can only ever ground Realism in social theory rather than
surpass it critically. In truth, the Realist problematic squats at the
root of the idea of uneven and combined development, rather than being
exposed and explicated by it.

#### Realism explains all of human history and the formation of capitalism, and Marx uses IR theory to explain capitalism 30-33

**Davenport 11** (Andrew Davenport, BA, Corpus Christi College,
University of Oxford MA, University of Sussex PhD, "Marxism in IR:
Condemned to a Realist fate?" University of Sussex, UK, DOI:

What is it that underlies the meditations on the intransigence of
international conflict in Realist thought? As Justin Rosenberg, whose
views on the depth of Realism have changed over the years, observes
[with regard to the relative philosophical resources of liberalism and
Realism in IR, 'in International Theory, I think it would be truer to
say that it is liberalism which is intrinsically shallow, and Realism
which, for all its problems, is connected to a circumstance of profound
significance']{.underline} (Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2008: 96). That
circumstance is the fact of 'inter-societal coexistence', the 'political
fragmentation' of humanity (Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2008: 96). This
kernel of Realist thought is set out axiomatically by Robert Gilpin.10
**[Three assumptions underlie the Realist view of political life: The
first is the essentially conflictual nature of international affairs....
The second ... is that the essence of social reality is the group ... in
a world of scarce resources and conflict over the distribution of those
resources, human beings confront one another ultimately as members of
groups, and not as isolated individuals.]{.underline}** Homo sapiens is
a tribal species, and loyalty to the tribe for most of us ranks above
all loyalties other than that of the family. **[In the modern world, we
have given the name 'nation-state' to these competing tribes and the
name 'nationalism' to this form of loyalty]{.underline}**. True, the
name, size, and organization of the competing groups into [which our
species subdivides itself do alter over time]{.underline} --- tribes,
city-states, kingdoms, empires, and nation-states --- [due to economic,
demographic and technological changes]{.underline}. Regrettably,
however, the essential nature of intergroup conflict does not. **[The
third assumption that I believe characterizes realist thinking is the
primacy in all political life of power and security in human
motivation.]{.underline}** (Gilpin, 1986: 304--305) Realism in IR is
based upon a strong claim about the nature of political existence: that
mankind, as πολιτικον ζωον, has always been divided into, or organized
itself into, communities, of one sort or another, that are inherently
limited and particularistic, creating group identities --- insiders and
outsiders, friends and enemies, countrymen and foreigners. **[Whatever
the multitude of economic, cultural and other interactions between
societies, of incalculable number in the present but doubtless existent
in some measure as far back as ethnology and archaeology can trace, the
boundary, what in the course of development hardened into the political
boundary, has not been effaced]{.underline}**. The inside, the space of
politics, may be the arena in which the pursuit of the good life is made
possible, but the character of its constitution is such that externally
it always remains within the state of nature, the domain of sheer
survival. [What Realism thus perceives with unequalled clarity is that
the form of the political simultaneously creates internal unity and
external division]{.underline}. So, as the Realists can easily concede,
[the configurations of the political, the modes of organization of the
inner space, may undergo immense historical change, from at least the
ancient polis through to the modern nation-state, as do, with it, the
dynamics of international relations in particular eras, but the
condition of the international, the global political being of humanity,
does not change, remaining always fractured and prone to
conflict]{.underline}. It is from this circumstance of fragmentation, of
multiple particularist political communities, with borders (whether
formally defined or not) creating divisions of inside and outside,
always interacting but always potentially hostile, that **[Realism
deduces the inevitable periodic recurrence of war and derives the
invariant abstraction of geopolitics]{.underline}**. The implications of
the circumstance of inter-societal coexistence for Marxist theorizing,
especially in IR, are substantial, and have been most extensively, if
idiosyncratically, set out in a too little noted article by R.N. Berki
from 1971. Berki opens with the assertion that 'the very existence of
international relations poses a serious, and perhaps intractable,
problem for Marxism' (1971: 80; emphasis in original) **[because
'international relations presuppose the horizontal division of mankind
into nations or states, and since Marxian thought postulates the
absolute unity of mankind as its ideal, problems relating to horizontal
group diversity are much more centrally relevant to the Marxian doctrine
than it is usually thought]{.underline}**'.11 In a summary overview,
Berki observes that, in 'conventional Marxism', 'classes ..., and not
nations or states, are the basic units of history, and the struggle
between classes, instead of interstate conflict, occupies the center of
attention' (1971: 81). In this view, [the state, an apparatus of
political domination, is a product of class conflict, organized to
maintain the system of exploitation internally, and externally to
facilitate the overseas expansion of the bourgeois class]{.underline}.
Competition for markets among a globally self-divided bourgeoisie
generates recurrent (though not constant) inter-state war.
[Correspondingly, the proletariat, having a unity of interest in
overthrowing bourgeois society, is essentially a nationless
class.]{.underline} However, Berki then turns to Waltz's Man, the State
and War to expose a problem with this line of thinking. In his
explication of the second image, [Waltz had surveyed the development of
socialist and Marxist thinking on international issues up to the
outbreak of World War I and drawn the conclusion that the argument that
peace can be achieved through the internal perfection of states is
faulty.]{.underline} Berki comments, 'Waltz's question is legitimate:
"**[Is it capitalism or states that must be destroyed in order to get
peace, or must both be abolished]{.underline}**?" The distinction
between these two phases, or tasks, is certainly warranted in point of
theory' (1971: 84). Elaborating, he observes that: **[The problem ... is
whether the disappearance of the 'state' after the overthrow of
capitalism refers only to its internal character as an agency
maintaining oppression and exploitation of one class by another ... or
also to its external function, which can be defined as organizing and
promoting the interests of a group of people distinguished by their
permanent occupation of a certain geographical area]{.underline}**. It
does not matter, of course, whether now one calls it 'state', 'nation',
or 'community', or the 'administration of things' ... as long as what is
meant is a plurality of these units. (1971: 84) Berki notes that [Marx
and Engels, in their practical political thinking, were sometimes
enthusiastic in their support of national independence and
separateness]{.underline} (as, for example, in relation to Ireland and
Poland) [and he traces the historical phases]{.underline} (or traumas)
[in the 20th century through which Marxist theorists and political
figures professing an adherence to Marxism gradually not only came to
terms with political diversity, the separateness of nations, but
embraced it, so that 'the tendency is to afford more and more implicit
recognition to the ideal of a non-antagonistic world community
consisting of separate national units']{.underline} (1971: 92). Such an
accommodation with political realism, with the seeming givenness of
national diversities, might appear simply to be a normal development as
the doctrine grapples with recalcitrant reality. However, Berki goes
further and asks: '[can Marxism afford this compromise? Does it make any
sense in terms of Marxian thought, to talk about non-antagonistic
diversity? Can Marxism at all entertain the idea of liberated but
separate nations living peacefully side by side]{.underline}, without
thereby losing its coherence?' (1971: 86). It is not necessary to concur
with all aspects of Berki's reading of Marx's early works to see the
force of the argument, which is that **[it is not possible to reconcile
Marx's idea of a condition of universal human freedom with nations,
understood not simply as the modern nation-state but, more broadly, as
particularist political communities that form divisions of inside and
outside, and claim a right over a territorial area and the resources
contained therein]{.underline}**. **[For it inevitably produces a
disabling fragmentation of any possible universalism, when each 'nation'
claims exclusive possession of an area of territory]{.underline}**. In
such circumstances, it is difficult to know what non-antagonistic
diversity might mean in a developed world of all-round interconnection
because 'the point is that nations cannot help but be self-regarding, as
long as their position is that of owners of property in a wider
community characterized by economic interdependence' (Berki, 1971: 103;
emphasis in original). Berki's account suggests [the difficulty that
Waltz's second image argument, if correct, poses for Marxism: that the
particularist, inside/outside character of political communities means
that they are always unreconciled, at least potentially antagonistic,
that among those communities internal politics may be hierarchic and
ordered in a great variety of ways, but international politics is always
essentially anarchic]{.underline}. It is here that the real and
continuing power of Realism lies, as Justin Rosenberg has recently
argued at some length. Piqued by Alex Callinicos's dismissal of Realism
as impoverished in comparison with the richness of the tradition of
liberal thought (Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2008: 83), Rosenberg, in a
sense malgré lui-même, rises to a defence of the profundity of Realism
in its grasp of the seemingly intractable dilemmas of international
coexistence. While 'the substantive political analyses of neo-Realist
writers \[are\] disablingly thin', the relationship between Realism and
liberalism 'is somehow more complex --- and more paradoxical --- than
any simple contrast of "rich" and "thin" implies' (Rosenberg, 2008: 96).
([The status of Realism within IR arises from the fact that 'there is a
real sense in which liberalism]{.underline} [and actually most Marxist
thought]{.underline}) [is not, and does not possess, an international
theory']{.underline} (Rosenberg, 2008: 96); that is, [it is only Realism
that has attended with the necessary seriousness to the central premise
of International Relations as a discipline: geopolitical fragmentation,
and its consequences.]{.underline} From this fact of fragmentation
Realism derives its normative resources and its ethical stance: 'an
ontological critique of easy, self-serving universalisms; a highly
developed moral and practical sense of the tension between ends and
means; and a genuinely tragic appreciation of the anarchically inscribed
conflict of particularist (national) and common (international)
interests' (Rosenberg, 2008: 97). [Problems of political life that,
however problematically, are in some degree resolved in the inner space
of domestic political community, are reopened in the international
domain: internally 'legitimate' violence appearing externally as
threatening military potential and the instability endemic to managing
the relations of sovereign entities in an anarchic field unmediated by
superordinate authority]{.underline}. What Realism grasps is that these
problems of the 'ethical irrationality' (Rosenberg, 2008: 98) of the
world assume their most intractable form in international relations
because there is no higher level at which they can be resolved: the
nature of the political is such that the rationality and order of the
delimited political space continually issue in the irrationality and
disorder of the international. [Realism's insistent emphasis on anarchy,
the balance of power and the tragic, fallen nature of international
politics simply says, again and again, that at the level of the whole,
the totality, humanity is unaware of itself and not in control of its
own social existence --- that there is not and never has been a global
social subject.]{.underline} The political, the modality of human
self-determination, remains, at the level of the international,
perennial unfreedom. 'This fatality ... is the deeper issue to which
Realism is connected' (Rosenberg, 2008: 98).12

Macroeconomic theoretical formulations which attempt to explain the role
of military expenditures in the postwar American Economy have, for the
most part, relied heavily upon the model of capitalism generated by John
Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money.
[The problem of modern capitalism]{.underline}, Keynes argued, [is that
it often fails to generate enough aggregate demand to achieve
full-employment]{.underline}. While Keynes treated one component of
aggregate demand, consumption, as reasonably stable, he felt that the
other major component, investment demand, was highly unstable. If
investment demand failed to grow at a rate which was sufficient to
achieve full-employment, then the economy could move in a cumulative
downward spiral. [[Chronic depression]{.mark} or low level stagnation
[could be the long run state of capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
situation could come about if there was an insufficient reason to
invest. Why invest? To make a profit[. But, the profit making potential
of a given investment would depend upon the nature of the demand for the
enduse product of the investment.]{.underline} Unfortunately, such
demands were limited in both a natural sense, - thus Keynes' famous
comment: &dquo;Two pyramids, two masses for the dead, are twice as good
as one; but not so two railways from London to York&dquo;. \[11\] - and
in an unnatural sense, - [the highly unequal distribution of income
under capitalism makes it impossible for many to realize through the
market-place their real economic demands.]{.underline} Because of this,
there are only so many profitable investments that can be made at any
point in time. Further profitable investments depend upon a
will-o'-the-wisp known as innovation. If new ideas are contrived and
adapted to the market-place, and if people want or can be made to want a
particular product, then all will be well, for a while. Keynes argued
that all would not always be well, and that it was folly to 'let nature
take its course,' particularly since it might well be thought natural,
since people naturally desire to eat, to abandon an economic system
which would generate depressions of indefinite length. Keynes' wellknown
solution was to increase the demands made upon the economic system by
government. Such demands were to 'prime-the-pump' through production
that would use resources, generate demands and profits, but not encroach
upon that area of production where capitalists had been or might be able
to make profits. Unfortunately, Keynes' view of the nature of the
'government,' or 'State' was extremely unsophisticated. \... he thought
he could separate the parasitic elements of capitalism from capitalism
itself in order to save the lifeblood of the system from exhaustion. One
hardly needs to add that when he spoke of the role of State policy, he
conceived of the State as an institution which not only stands above
classes, but stands also above the warring interests of particular
monopoly-groups; as an impartial institution which can represent the
'general interest of society as a whole' and hence steer capitalism in
the social interest.\[12\] [The nature of the 'State' is such that [the
'State' is quite far from representing the general interest of society
as a whole]{.mark}.]{.underline} Throughout the 1930s, for example,
capitalists bitterly resisted any attempts to sustain aggregate demand
through social spending schemes. A few reforms which in the end have
stabilized the social system and sustained production without
interfering with wage rates in the labor market, such as 'welfare' for
those who are clearly incapable of engaging in the labor market, and
Social Security, have been accepted by corporate leaders. The economic
growth generated by military expenditures during World War II nicely
solved the 'either-or' dilemma of stagnation or social reform which
corporate leaders had feared - throughout the 1930s. After World War II
the Cold War became the ideological lever which pried loose ( public
monies in amounts sufficient enough to solve the problem which Keynes
had explained so B eloquently. [This is not to argue that a
Machiavellian group of corporate leaders thought up the Cold War and its
accoutrements, but rather that [the forces and interests of the entire
social system;]{.mark} the interests in Central European markets, the
interest in maintaining Europe itself in the capitalist sphere, the
interest in moving into the international markets which the French,
British, Germans, and Japanese had abandoned, and the need to stabilize
the postwar economy as the 'pent-up' demands of the war period were met,
[all culminated in a move toward military expenditures as a device to
insure worldwide hegemony]{.mark} and maintain production at a tolerable
level.]{.underline} \-- **[[Military expenditures]{.mark}, then, [meet
all the requirements for the Keynesian solution given the parameters of
the social system]{.mark}.]{.underline}** First, no private capitalist
markets are encroached upon - quite the reverse is the case. Second,
military expenditures are at least 'neutral' with respect to the
distribution of socio-economic power.\[13\] Third, there is no increase
in productive capacity which will add to conventional domestic market
supply[. In fact, weapons cannot be over-supplied as there is no
definition of excess supply. [Weapons can be]{.mark} declared obsolete
and [scrapped,]{.mark} thereby [creating a need for new weapons
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fourth, by increas- , ing the government
sector and working through the B 'balanced budget multiplier effect'
Keynes' anticipation of stagnation is forestalled. Finally, military
expenditures can be used as a counter-cyclical de- vice at the same time
that they basically function as an anti-stagnation device. [The
[military budget can be juggled to fit the need]{.mark}. Missile systems
can be left half-built (and this has happened with billions of dollars
worth of 'systems'), or continued - such flexibility cannot be built
into school or dam building programs, much less aid to the
handicapped.]{.underline} Why, if Keynesian theory points to the need
for an enlarged, flexible government sector which has been so adequately
fulfilled through the dependency upon military expenditures, have there
been any irregularities whatsoever in postwar economic growth? First,
time was a necessary ingredient in constructing such a colossal control
factor. Thus, in the early postwar period, particularly from 1948
through 1952[, military expenditures were not successfully integrated
with the needs of the economic system]{.underline}. Second, the
macroeconomic system consists of an incredible number of
interrelationships. It is simply not possible with any great degree of
precision to estimate the magnitude of movements within the economy. [In
terms of interrelating military expenditures with the future needs of
the economic system it is necessary to attempt to predicts
expectations - a near impossible task. In / addition, there are
international factors that must be considered but rarely can be
controlled.]{.underline} Furthermore, there are dynamic destabilizing
and stabilizing movements taking place throughout the economy
simultaneously. It is difficult, particularly when it becomes necessary
to anticipate the rate of change of these dynamic actions, to anticipate
the effects of the dynamics of the economic system. In addition, there
are information lags and lags before actions can take place. Thus, as
Bill Warren has argued, [capitalist planning is limited primarily to
controlling the direction of the economy through the utilization of
contractionary or expansionary instruments of 'State'
power.]{.underline} Any number of disequilibria remain in capitalist
economies which, singly or in combination, can in principle easily
initiate a downswing. No system of capitalist planing yet devised has
eliminated such imbalances. But , the crucial problem is the reaction of
the economy as a whole to the initiating disturbance, and it is at this
point that the role of State policy has been decisive. [The
determination of post-war capitalist States to prevent various
recessions becoming catastrophic has not only limited the depth of such
recessions as have occurred, but has had the vital effect of creating
confidence in business circles that full employment policies with their
high levels, will be restored. This has in turn ensured that investment
levels have been maintained and/or raised despite limited and temporary
setbacks.]{.underline} This stimlating effect on business expectations
and expenditures, accompanied by similar effects on private consumption,
has been a powerful expansionary force, the very existence of which
lessens the need for government action to raise employment levels.
Provided investment rates are maintained and real wages rise pari passu
with increasing productivity, there is no reason to envisage a
stagnationist, under-consumptionist view of the prospects for capitalism
; and these are precisely what the capitalist state plus the trade
unions have jointly achieved.\[14\] Third, there is no unanimity as to
the 'best' level of macroeconomic performance amongst corporate leaders.
The 'liberal' corporate leaders generally prefer a more activist stance
in foreign affairs, and a more dynamic economy. They are generally
willing to trade price stability for economic growth (if they can). On
the other hand, the 'conservative' corporate leaders are more committed
to 'sound finance' and the 'sound dollar'. [High employment means rising
prices and wages, as well as some dynamic instability in the corporate
structure which might work to the disadvantage of entrenched corporate
wealth.]{.underline}\[15\] Total stability is an objective of most
Keynesian economists, but it is not a shared value amongst those who
make policy decisions. M. Kalecki noted, in 1943, that there was a
decided lack of commitment to conventional Keynesian values on the part
of corporate leaders. Moderate cycles were preferred, for the most part,
to maintaining full-employment. A business cycle, then, can be induced
by those who feel that is what the 1 system needs. Thus, the 'political
business cycle: ' This state of affairs is perhaps symptomatic of the
future economic regime of capitalist democracies. In the slump, either
under the pressure of the masses, or even without it, public investment
financed by borrowing will be undertaken to prevent large-scale unem-
ployment. But if attempts are made to apply this method in order to
maintain the high level of employment reached in the subsequent boom a
strong opposition of 'business leaders' is likely to be encountered. As
has already been argued, lasting full employment is not at all to their
liking. The workers would 'get out of hand' and the 'captains of
industry' would be anxious to 'teach them a lesson'. Moreover, the price
increase in the upswing is to the disadvantage of small and big rentiers
and makes them 'boom tired'.\[16\] Kalecki argued that corporate leaders
would see to it that only a 'reasonable' amount of macro stability was
ensured[. They would accept four basic forms of economic stimulus from
the State in order to avert an extreme depression: (1) Tax cuts; (2)
Lower interest rates; (3) Subsidization of investment, and (4) Increases
in armaments expenditures. In the postwar era in the U.S., corporate
leaders have been able to obtain all four of these through the military
program, at one time or another]{.underline} (progress payments which
eliminate the necessity to borrow in order to complete a contract, quick
depreciation schemes for 'defense related' investments in the 1950s, and
virtually ever-growing armaments programs). Therefore, Kalecki argued,
[the [postwar period]{.mark} would be [dominated by the 'political
business cycle']{.mark}: The regime of the 'political business cycle'
would be an artificial restoration of the position as it existed in
nineteenth-century capitalism]{.underline}. Full employment would be
reached only at the top of the boom, but slumps would be relatively mild
and short lived.\[17\] Something not unlike the 'political business
cycle' seems to explain the poor performance of the economy through
1960, and from 1969 through 1971. There was an obvious lack of
commitment to the concept of full-employment during these years. During
the late 1950s military expenditures were kept large in order to offset
stagnation tendencies, and they were employed counter-cyclically, but
not at levels which would have been adequate to achieve full-employment
growth - i.e., 'potential growth' of perhaps 4 percent per year. On the
other hand, Kennedy, and the corporate leaders he interacted with, were
committed to a 'get-the-countrymoving-again' view. As a consequence,
military expenditures and other forms of government stimulus were
employed in the 1960s to keep the growth rate high. Nixon publically
stated that he wanted to induce a recession in 1969, and in fiscal year
1970 military expenditures were reduced by \$1.8 billion. In fiscal year
1971 military expenditures were still not up to the 1969 level, and
military expenditures as a percent of GNP had fallen from 12.6 percent
in 1969 to 11.1 percent in 1971.

The Marxist perspectives on ME (military spending) and capitalism
present separate arguments that can be critiqued and to a considerable
degree dismissed. None are adequate alone and no com- bination yields a
satisfactory analysis. There are certain vague points of commonality
bet- ween these perspectives, but the most glaring commonality and, in
fact, the devastating weakness is their inability to place ME within the
context of a theory of the State. Other Marxists and the
Instrumentalists have made great strides in recent years in developing a
theory of the State \[11\]. None of the theories, unfortunately (and
surprisingly) treats the questions of ME in any depth - most ignore the
issue. Of all the theories, that which is most promising, in terms of ME
in particular, is a contemporary version of State Monopoly Capitalism or
Stamocap advanced by Ben Fine, Lawrence Harris and (less explicitly) Bob
Jessop.3 Unlike the stagnationist NM (Neo-Marxists), their version of
Stamocap asserts that the capitalist mode of production is one that has
as its dominant tendency the \"self-expansion of value,\" i.e. the
system is driven by expansionary forces. But Stamocap recognizes, as do
the NM, that monopoly capitalism short-circuits the feedback mechanism
whereby profits are \"automatically\" reinvested in capital
accumulation. Thus there is a tension between the monopoly sector and
the \"capital-logic\" of the system. Left to its own devices monopoly
capitalism leads inexorably to 1929. But at the level of the capitalist
mode of production a systemic solution is demanded. Internal to the
system - although external to the monopoly sector - is the need for a
counteracting tendency. The State, then, arises out of the ashes of the
depression and WWII not as an extension of Adam Smith\'s watchman State,
but as a State that is an integrated part of the entire capital
accumulation process. Thus the State is involved internally within the
sphere of exchange, and the sphere of distribution, but more crucially
for the argument here, the State is involved within the sphere of
production - as an integral part of production. From this perspective
the func- tion of the State is not simply or primarily to create waste
(although this may be done under certain historical circumstances) but
rather to create and continually recreate the necessary conditions for
the \"self -expansion\" of capital. [Regarding ME (military spending)
the State is involved in underwriting advanced technology both because
monopoly capital tends to underinvest and because many modern
technologies are beyond the funding capacities and/or too risky for even
the largest capitals (commercial satellites, the space shuttle, etc.).
[Arms contracting]{.mark}, then, [becomes a way of socializing the costs
of technical change]{.mark} which [leads to]{.mark} further [expanded
reproduction and,]{.mark} due to productivity increases, [wage increases
as well]{.mark}. A further advantage is that ME does not have to be
justified once it becomes part of the social fabric and therefore ME can
be mov- ed at will to counter business cycle tendencies. [ME]{.mark} (at
least in the U.S. case) [was the great Accumulator of late capitalism,
and the great Legitimator]{.mark} within the nation state [in the
postwar period]{.mark} (1948-1970). Beyond the nation-state the military
apparatus was and is used to gain access to raw materials and markets on
favorable terms from the Third World. [ME]{.mark} could also be
[used]{.mark} in a Keynesian fashion (spend in order to tax while
leaving a positive margin of accumulation) [to reconstruct Western
Europe and Japan]{.mark} thereby [rais- ing overall trade and]{.mark}
[enhancing]{.mark} the [possibilities of accumulation while underwriting
legitimation]{.mark} outlays [in]{.mark} these [advanced capitalist
nations.]{.mark}]{.underline} As a careful study of the postwar long
boom would indicate, military Keynesianism \"worked,\" but only under
cer- tain historical conditions. The NM have failed to qualify and limit
their analysis of military Keynesianism to specific conjunctural
conditions. CM, meanwhile, have spent more time denying the possibility
of the Keynesian policies fostering accumulation than they have trying
to understand how military Keynesianism functioned in the long expan-
sionary period. As is now obvious, the perpetual-motion machine of
Stamocap has now been exploded from within and without. From within
starting in the 1960s there was a noticeable falling- off of major
technical innovations \[26,-185-92\]. That may have been due to the fact
that while Stamocap combined the State with monopoly capital it did so
in a manner that left a degree of autonomy both to the supercorporations
and the State. In the 1960s strategic planners in the State became
preoccupied with advanced missile technologies that pro- duced
relatively few spin-offs into the sphere of production. (Meanwhile other
forms of state investments such as infrastructure failed to grow at
previous rates.) Two other equal- ly important elements precipitated the
as yet unresolved crisis that began in 1968-69. The State managers
entered into a crisis of the State and subsequently a crisis of social
relations due to their single-minded and elusive pursuit of victory in
Vietnam. Meanwhile, the hegemonic relationship that the U.S. maintained
over the advanced capitalist nations degenerated into rivalry as
signaled by the fall of the Bretton Woods system. [A fourth precipitator
is to be found in the productive forces brought to life during the
postwar boom in the Newly Industrializing Countries. The postwar
technologies allowed many corporations to produce, manufacture and
distribute on a world level. Capital became mobile and headed to cheap
labor havens.]{.underline} On the world market this created
overproduction/overaccumulation tendencies. Today the advanced
capitalist nations are burdened by three forces that have slowed to a
crawl the accumulation of capital: (1) stagnation in investment because
of a slowdown in the diffusion (if not in fact the creation) of
exploitable technologies, (2) stagnation in investment because the old
technologies of the third technological revolution (petrochemicals,
plastics, synthetics, telecommunica- tions, advanced and consumer
electronics, etc.) have been exported into the newly in- dustrialized
countries of the \"Third World\" and their ability to cut labor costs
makes fur- ther investments in the old technologies unprofitable in the
advanced capitalist nations, (3) excess capacity in the industrial
sectors of all advanced capitalist nations. Although the question of the
multiple sources of the current crisis cannot be detailed here it is
clear that there can be no \"theory\" of ME and capitalism that is
unrelated to the conjunctural moment as the system moves through the
long cycle of growth/barrier(crisis), reconstitution/growth. Therefore,
forms of analysis that explained phenomena in the postwar period, such
as military Keynesianism may fail to do so in the crisis-reconstitution
period. In the late 1960s and into the 1970s the OCC (expressed as the
value composition of capital) rose and the profit rate fell not only in
the U.S. but across the advanced capitalist nations \[3;21,57\]. To date
(1985) only the U.S. has partially recovered from the effects that
became manifest in the late 1960s (Japan\'s recovery is beyond the scope
of this paper). It is within the context of the breakdown of Stamocap
regulation that the rise of Reaganism must be located. In part,
Reaganism seeks to raise the profit rate by lowering the wage rate, but
that raises the specter of underconsumption. Reaganism also represents a
profound shift away from military Keynesianism (with its considerable
em- phasis on full-employment legitimation) to Functional Militarism
(which single-mindedly concentrates on national and international forms
of accumulation and upward redistribu- tion of income). [The \"capital
logic\" of Reaganism is to be found primarily in his \"Rearm- ing
America\" program where through 1984 ME was inordinately concentrated in
conven- tional weapons and precision-guided weapons that had the virtue,
from the perspective of \"capital-logic\" of picking-up the slack in the
old industries of the second technological revolution (oil, steel,
autos, machine-tools) as well as the output of industries arising from
the third technological revolution \[7; 10\].]{.underline} The impact,
however, has been greatest in terms of the sphere of distribution and
exchange. Very little new investment (aside from ra- tionalization
investments in autos and steel and sheer financial speculation) has
occurred. Another element of \"capital-logic\" in relation to ME in
recent years is the U.S. offensive against the \"Third World.\"
[Although the Newly Industrializing Countries have not been set-back too
far by this policy as yet, outlays on the rapid deployment force,
paramilitary forces, new bases, etc. may be understood as an effort to
maintain and expand the range of unequal exchange with the \"Third
World\" thereby raising the profit rate (and facilitating capital
accumulation).]{.underline} A third element, which as yet has defied
quantitative or qualitative measurement, is the attempt by the
Department of Defense to foster a sweeping reorganization of U.S. in-
dustrial production by way of the MANTECH (manufacturing technology)
program and related programs \[11. These broad programs (which cannot be
discussed here) would sug- gest that a Japanese style MITI may be U.S.
Stamocap\'s response to intensified interna- tional rivalry. While
future empirical work on the relationship between ME and Capitalism will
be forced to take into account the shift in State policies from military
Keynesianism to Func- tional Militarism a note of caution is necessary[.
Functional Militarism remains very much a policy-in-the-making while
powerful fractions of capital (and society at large) retain strong
material interests in military Keynesianism.]{.underline} Buffeted by
the forces unleashed by the increasing tendency toward the
internationalization of capital, nation-based Stamocap is undergoing
crucial metamorphoses. Rather than searching for a constant relationship
between ME and Capitalism, it is to be hoped that critical analysts
will, in the present conjuncture, turn their attention to the role of
the State within the context of economie crisis and the new role of ME
within State policy. Understanding the contribu- tions and detours of
the past is one (necessary) way of moving forward in this difficult
area.

**[[Against]{.mark} the [presumption]{.mark} that [the individual is the

and **[rupturing the status quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the actuality of
their movement displacing the politics of identity. Bringing together
thinkers such as Elias Canetti and Alain Badiou, I highlight the
"egalitarian discharge" of the crowd event as an intense experience of
substantive collectivity. I make fidelity to this event the basis for a
new theory of the communist party. [Because global movements

about these questions, we need to consider the party form unfettered by
the false concreteness of specific parties in the contingency of their
histories. Liberals and democrats are not the only political theorists
who can reflect on their modes of association in the abstract.
Communists must do this as well.

As a means of breaking out of the binaries of reform or revolution, mass
or vanguard party that historically have inflected discussions of the
party form, I approach the function and purpose of the communist party
psycho-dynamically. I draw from Robert Michels and Jacques Lacan to
think through the affects the party generates and the unconscious
processes it mobilizes. The role of the party isn't to inject knowledge
into the working class. Nor is it to represent the interests of the
working class on the terrain of politics. Rather, [[the function of the
party is to]{.mark} hold open a gap in our setting so as to **[enable a

Canetti makes a point I return to throughout the book: **[[crowds come

refers to as the "discharge." Akin to Lacan's notion of "enjoyment"
("jouissance," the only substance known to psychoanalysis), the
discharge provides a material ground for the party. [[The party]{.mark}

Neo-Gramscian theory Neo-Gramscian theory has been centrally concerned
to crack open Realism's 'billiard ball' conception of the 'national
territorial totality' and demonstrate how the state, and by extension
the states system, is a site of contestation for a range of conflicting
social forces of production. [The singular, homogeneous state is
replaced by the idea of a 'state--society complex' and thereby the
internal structure and development of states through various class
alliances and modernization programmes can be traced, using the
Gramscian conceptual terminology of 'historic blocs', 'passive
revolution', 'hegemony' and so forth.]{.underline} However, it is
recognized that the singular state--society complex exists within a
plurality of states: 'complexes of production relations, classes, and
historic blocs do not exist in isolated national compartments. They are
linked to a world order that bears directly on them, as well as
influencing them through their national states' (Cox, 1987: 6--7). [The
novelty of the neo-Gramscian approach is the extension of the Gramscian
concepts to the international sphere, especially the concept of
hegemony, by which, in the original Gramscian context, a dominant class
co-opts subaltern classes to its project of national development and
maintains their support more by consent than coercion, and, in its new
international sense, the dominant class of the leading state, through
alliances with like-minded classes or class fractions in other states,
constructs a particular world order]{.underline}. The focus of much
neo-Gramscian theorizing is the periods of transition between historical
world orders --- how one breaks down and a new one is constructed ---
with a view to determining whether the present constitutes a historical
moment of transition and, if so, what the possibilities are for a
broadly anti-capitalist or anti-imperialist hegemonic project.
Accordingly, much of Cox's major work (1987) is taken up with,
effectively, a narrative of the constitution and dissolution of first
British 19th-century, and then American 20th-century, hegemonies. The
problematic of the states system has been attended to from a
neo-Gramscian perspective by Mark Rupert. [Central to the argument is a
reading of the concept of 'alienation' as found in Marx's early
writings. Under capitalist relations of production, by which the worker
is freed from personal relations of domination but is also divorced from
direct access to the means of production, alienation works on multiple
levels]{.underline}: [the worker is alienated from the product of his
own labour, which under the regime of private property belongs to the
capitalist; he is alienated from his own life-activity, the process of
self-objectification through labour, because his labour is always for
an]{.underline} (antagonistic) [other]{.underline}; and 'estranged
labour involves the alienation of human beings from one another, and of
the individual from the species' (Rupert, 1993: 71). [These multiple
alienations are said to generate, at the general societal level, the
separation of economics and politics, and the abstraction of the purely
political state characteristic of capitalist societies]{.underline};
thus, 'the very existence of the kind of states portrayed by neo-realist
theory presupposes relations of alienation in which "politics" assumes
an identity distinct from "economics" and attains its own institutional
form of expression' (Rupert, 1993: 84). The result of this bringing
together of Marx's early writings and IR theory is that
'**[international politics may then be critically understood as a kind
of second-order alienation]{.underline}**. That is, **[international
politics concerns itself with the mutual estrangement of political
communities which are themselves constructed within relations of
alienation']{.underline}** (Rupert, 1993: 84). To the extent that
Rupert's approach limits itself to a theorization of the constitution
and nature of capitalist geopolitics, [it cannot fully go behind its
target, neo-Realism, because the Realist claim about the multiplicity of
political communities extends well beyond the capitalist epoch: to
explain the nature of one historical form of geopolitics is not to
explain geopolitics itself]{.underline}. Further, to speak of the
separation of economics and politics simply assumes the validity of the
two determinations rather than making them the object of critique. But
more widely, Rupert's argument exposes the question of the applicability
of Gramsci's concepts to the study of IR. **[The solution Rupert poses
to the problem of international alienation is a political practice that
'overturns the hegemony of state-based conceptions of politics ...
mediates between various "national" groups whose political practices had
been contained within such conceptions, and enables their active
participation in the construction of a global political
community']{.underline}** (1993: 87). This appears to envisage a
political strategy that self-consciously aims to transcend national
boundaries. By contrast, Robert Cox in his seminal article introducing
the Gramscian conceptual apparatus into IR insisted that an
[anti-capitalist hegemonic strategy must be based at the national level:
'A significant structural change in world order is,
accordingly]{.underline}, likely to be traceable to some fundamental
change in social relations and in the national political orders which
correspond to national structures of social relations' and so,
consequently, '**[the national context remains the only place where an
historic bloc can be founded, although world-economy and world-political
conditions materially influence the prospects for such an
enterprise']{.underline}** (Cox, 1983: 173--174).15 What Cox's
stipulation reflects is that Gramsci's theoretical thinking about
political praxis was centred on the national context and thereby assumed
the political. As Randall Germain and Michael Kenny put it: 'Throughout
the Prison Notebooks \[Gramsci\] is clear that [socialists have to embed
their arguments within the soil of national political and popular
cultures; hence the power of his understanding of the concept of the
"national-popular"]{.underline}' (1998: 12). In discussing the extension
of the concept 'historic bloc' from the national to the international
sphere, Stephen Gill and David Law contend that '[the concept of an
international historic bloc means much more than an alliance of
capitalist interests across national boundaries. It implies that
elements of more than one class were involved, its basis was more
organic and rooted in material and normative structures of
society']{.underline} (1993: 97). But can such concepts be smoothly
transferred 'across national boundaries' from the domestic to the
international? Germain and Kenny argue that [Gramsci's understanding of
the state--civil society complex was predicated on the national context
and that 'to speak of a specifically Gramscian reading of civil society
divorced from its necessary relationship to the state is therefore to
obscure the way in which the relationship of the two analytical
categories comprises for Gramsci a single social entity']{.underline}
(1998: 13; emphasis in original). In the international domain, despite
all talk of a developing 'international state', no such state structure
exists; rather, '[national states remain the only political authorities
capable of taking public decisions and acting with governmental
authority in world politics today']{.underline} (Germain and Kenny,
1998: 14). This surely makes problematic the use of Gramscian concepts
in the discussion and analysis of 'international civil society' and
global social forces. For the use of such concepts, which are
specifically predicated on the national context and thus presuppose the
particular characteristics of political community and the
national--international distinction central to Realist thinking,16 for
analysis of international relations serves largely to obscure, rather
than grasp and explicate, the problematic of the multiplicity of
particularist political units that Realists insist upon. To this extent,

Such an account has the benefit of [resisting 'economic determinist'
critiques of international law in which all juridical and political
relations and all forms of normativity are reduced to an economic mode
of production, and in which international law is condemned as merely the
expression of 'capitalist imperialism']{.underline}. In this respect the
account offers an alternative mode of 'left critique' than that offered
by the 'commodity-form theory of international law' as developed by
Pashukanis (1978) and popularised by Miéville (2006). In doing [so I
hope to develop a critique of the modern form of liberal international
law, while at the same time being able to hold onto the emancipatory
potential of international law via,]{.underline} albeit briefly[,
highlighting its inheritance of the traditions of radical natural law
and radical republican constitutionalism]{.underline}. [Remembering that
international law inherits at least aspects of these traditions helps us
to conceptualise global juridical relations as a site of contestation
**over questions of social and economic justice**.]{.underline} Within
this, [ongoing normative claims about justice, human dignity, equality
and democracy present a variety of counter-hegemonic discourses aimed at
reorganising and marshalling global political economy]{.underline}. Even
when confined to the margins, [the endless presence of counter-hegemonic
international legal discourses]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} often
[demand the rendering as public what has previously been rendered as
private, operate as a potential, enduring nightmare for liberal
international law]{.underline}.

### Perm -- Reforms 

#### Reformism is possible and better than a violent revolution. Helps transition from capitalism without dangerous processes of state-destruction.

the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the author of The Rise and
Fall of Neoliberal Capitalism, "All the King's Horses: Neoliberal

[The economic crisis of 2008 marked the end of the ability of the
neoliberal form of capitalism to promote stable economic
expansion]{.underline}. In the wake of the massive housing-bubble
collapse and financial crash, the previous debt-and-bubble-based growth
machine cannot be revived. The banks continue to find new speculative
ventures and corporate profits remain high, but this process no longer
brings normal economic expansion.

Change: Reactionary, Reformist, or Radical?

[So far, the powers that be, in the United States and elsewhere, have
been pursuing "austerity policy" as a way of doubling down on
neoliberalism, which has greatly rewarded the "one
percent."]{.underline} However, continuing along that path promises only
unending stagnation. [Long-lasting stagnation is destabilizing to
capitalism, tending to promote the growth of **political
movements**---on the left and the right---**demanding major political
and economic change**]{.underline}. This prods big business to consider
some restructuring of capitalism to overcome stagnation and its
dangerous consequences.

[**There is some evidence of the beginnings of big business
consideration of economic alternatives**.]{.underline} In January 2015,
[Lawrence Summers, a close ally of Wall Street who promoted bank
deregulation in the 1990s as treasury secretary in the Clinton
administration, coauthored a major report calling for significant
institutional changes]{.underline}---including measures to reduce
inequality and to redirect large corporations toward the pursuit of
long-run gains instead of short-run profits. (See John Miller, "The
'Secular Stagnation' Debate," D&S, May/June 2015.)

Big business is not the only actor on the stage. If history is any
guide, [we can expect that various groups and classes will become
increasingly active in the years ahead, pushing for changes that would
further their own interests]{.underline}. While significant change seems
highly likely, the precise outcome cannot be foretold in advance. [Three
possible directions of change can be identified---reactionary,
reformist, and radical. Which one emerges will depend on the relative
strength and determination of the potential beneficiaries of each kind
of change]{.underline}. If labor and other popular movements remain
relatively weak, as they have after several decades of demoralization
and demobilization under neoliberalism, big business will likely drive
change in the reactionary direction. This could take the form of a
statist and nationalist form of capitalism without any capital-labor
compromise.The neoliberal labor market and the current weak position of
labor would remain, while the underlying problem of inadequate growth of
demand would be solved via growing state spending for military purposes
and perhaps infrastructure and technological innovation. Nationalism is
the likely dominant ideology of such a transformation, focusing the
attention of the 99% on building national economic and military strength
and away from the limited economic benefits for them of this reactionary
direction of change. Two prominent right-wing intellectuals, Francis
Fukuyama and William Kristol, have recently suggested a move in that
direction. Such a reactionary program would not only spell continuing
bad conditions for American workers but, with further military buildup
and nationalist posturing, a growing danger of even greater inter-state
conflict than we have seen in recent times.

**[If the labor movement]{.underline}**, and other popular movements,
[**gain** in **strength**]{.underline}, then [a]{.underline} second[**,
reformist, direction of change would become possible**. This might
entail another capital-labor compromise]{.underline}. A form of
capitalism like the previous regulated capitalism, of the post-World War
II period, [could potentially **resolve the current economic crisis by
bringing a more balanced growth of profits and wages**]{.underline}. [It
would]{.underline} also likely [include a **growing state role focused
on infrastructure, innovation, education, social provision, and
environmental protection**.]{.underline} However, change of that type
has never come from a "forward-looking" big business class. It would
become a serious possibility only if the labor and progressive movements
revive and are able to force compromise on the capitalists. Unless big
business sees a mortal threat to capitalism, it is not likely to be
willing to compromise with labor.

[A reformist direction of change]{.underline}, while **[better for the
majority]{.underline}** than the reactionary direction, would still pose
serious problems. The previous capital-labor compromise of the 1940s to
the 1960s left out some groups, notably many women and many African
Americans, and it is not clear today if all of the 99% could be
accommodated under a renewed compromise. Also, such a reformed
capitalism is not a promising system for avoiding disastrous climate
change. Reformed capitalism would require---and give rise
to---relatively robust economic growth, which would make it difficult
and perhaps impossible to avoid the looming climate-change tipping
point. While reformed capitalism would likely include measures aimed at
environmental protection, large private companies tend to be effective
in resisting government measures that limit their freedom of action in
pursuit of profit.

#### Policymaking can solve for problems in the current system by instituting reforms and moving to Moral Capitalism

Stanford, JD from Harvard, 2/14/19, \"A Call to Moral Capitalism,\"
American Prospect, https://prospect.org/article/call-moral-capitalism,
Accessed: 7-23-2019, MWM)

Last month, our president told 800,000 federal employees to make do
without paychecks for 35 days. Full-time workers lined up at soup
kitchens. Families frantically begged for loan deferments, credit
extensions, and acts of mercy from their banks. Air-traffic controllers
put in ten-hour shifts, then worked as Uber drivers to make ends meet.
The contract workers who clean government offices, guard government
doors, and serve government meals are still not guaranteed one cent of
the pay they missed.

The January shutdown bore all the ugly hallmarks of the Trump
presidency, from overt racism to tone-deaf privilege. And---beneath it
all---an administration that sees the livelihood of ordinary Americans
as a bargaining chip they are willing to trade away.

For our president, it was the latest notch in the belt of a man who has
broken every populist promise he made. Elections---and history---will
put him in his rightful place. For our country, however, the past month
was one chapter in a saga that began long before Donald Trump and that
demands an equally profound reckoning: the mounting injustice of our
modern economy.

It's a story about GDP or stock prices or innovation. It's also the
story of a global superpower where 18.5 million people live in deep
poverty. Where we reward vast wealth with tax cuts, loopholes, and
endless ways to ensure dollars earn more dollars, but value actual labor
at only \$7.25 an hour. A place whose laws steadfastly protect
multinational corporations like Philips Lighting and General Motors when
they harvest millions from government tax cuts while laying off workers
from Fall River to Detroit; but where laws stand idle when a farmworker
in the Yakima Valley or a waitress in Boston are forced to work overtime
without pay, when a housekeeper in Phoenix faces sexual violence on the
job, when FedEx and Uber misclassify drivers to evade giving them basic
benefits, when Jiffy Lube destroys their workers' leverage to negotiate
better wages and WalMart refuses accommodations for pregnant workers and
fast-food franchises deny their employees predictable hours.

Here, our medical innovations subsidize global health, but our citizens
die rationing insulin they can't afford. Here, we dehumanize immigrants
with one hand while exploiting their cheap labor with the other. Here,
we let redlines course through housing markets and neighborhoods,
segregating schools 50 years after Jim Crow. We subject the poor to
endless tests of character for our taxes to cover their next hot meal.
But the rich face no such scrutiny when our taxes float their stock
prices. We let the wealthy divert and dilute resources from public
schools, public transit, and public housing meant to level the
inevitable tip of capitalist scales and then criminalize the
marginalized when they can't hang on.

This is the story of our modern economy and of a government that aided,
abetted, and encouraged its rise. It is the challenge of our time.
[American capitalism has undeniably done more good for more people than
any other economic system.]{.underline} But capitalism as we know it
today is badly broken and---rightfully---under attack. The sooner we
confront that, the sooner we can strip it to the studs and build
something better. [A moral capitalism, judged not by how much it
produces, but how broadly it empowers, backed by a government unafraid
to set the conditions for fair and just markets.]{.underline}

Today, the United States government is called to be an economic
activist; to remedy the injustice it has let fester on its watch; to
jump off the sidelines of an economy with the highest disparities of
almost any advanced nation on earth and demand, with the full force of
its mighty laws, that we do better.

First, [our government must aggressively address and redress economic
abuse]{.underline}. Decades of trickle-down dogma created a tsunami of
deregulation, union-busting, and rampant consolidation that destroyed
any semblance of balance between corporate power and worker clout.

[Reform efforts should end predatory corporate practices.]{.underline}
From non-competes and no-poach agreements to outdated antitrust laws
that have failed to check the consequences of monopoly power for both
consumers and employees. [Congress must flex its muscles and actively
disincentivize the shareholder-first mentality that gave corporate
America over \$1 trillion in stock buybacks last year while working
America got pink slips]{.underline}. Instead, we must defend a system of
fair taxation that demands significantly more from those at the top.

Particular industries require extra vigilance, from the technology
companies that commoditize our data, invade our privacy, and endanger
our democracy---to the pharmaceutical companies that price patients out
of life-saving treatment. [Strong and smart regulation is not a weight
on growth but a necessary condition for a capitalist system
capable---and worthy---of survival.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, economic abuse has not just been perpetrated by private
hands. Our public sector shares blame, creating and condoning
discriminatory systems that keep people of color, women, the LGBTQ
community, the disabled, and others under a heavy economic thumb. Racist
housing policies, segregation of neighborhoods and schools, a broken
criminal justice system, and inequitable delivery of federal dollars
make it nearly impossible for black America and other historically
oppressed communities to survive, compete, and build wealth.

Just 15 percent of the nearly \$550 billion our government issued in
contracts last year went to minority- and women-owned businesses. That's
not opportunity building, it's opportunity hoarding, for those already
in the driver's seat of our economy.

Second, [government must be a fierce guarantor of economic protection.
From independent contracting to low-wage job growth and gig employment,
our federal labor protections have failed to keep pace with the economic
reality]{.underline} for most American workers. We need to catch up.
[That means a livable minimum wage, health insurance detached from
employment status, paid family and sick leave, and a massive expansion
of the number of Americans assured these benefits in a modern
economy.]{.underline} It means anti-discrimination laws that apply to
all, a full-throated defense of a worker's right to organize, unionize,
and strike---and a justice system that protects class action, ends
forced arbitration, and promises recourse to any who are wronged or
abused.

Third, [government must be a reliable supplier of public goods. From
primary and secondary education to infrastructure and national
defense---we operate robust public systems for that which we deem
essential to our national interest.]{.underline} Which makes their
equitable and universal delivery worthy of public investment.

However, we fail to extend this mentality to two systems American
families most depend on---health care and child care. Existing federal
structures barely touch the level of need. At a time when the vast
majority of parents work outside the home, our current Child Tax Credit
gives eligible families---already a tiny sliver of the country---\$2,000
a year, at most, to defray costs. Meanwhile, the annual price tag of
full-time infant care in Massachusetts is over \$17,000---higher than
in-state tuition at our public university. And the devastating
inequities of American health care grow more painful by the day, with
GoFundMe pages becoming as common as insurance coverage.

It is time to create universal, public systems for both health care and
child care, where access isn't restricted by employment, income, or
geography---and where affordability comes with a government guarantee.

Finally, [government must mobilize our economy around our national
interest]{.underline}. In recent decades, Washington has taken a
stubbornly passive approach to economic mobilization, time and again
deferring to market forces, corporate profit, and private instincts. Not
since the Great Society have we proactively channeled our economic might
toward higher, nobler needs---health, safety, security, and livelihood.

But today a threat at our doorstep gives us the opportunity to change
that. Climate change. An arrow aimed at all of us. But striking hardest
where government insufficiency always does: those we have historically
repressed or systemically left behind. Black and brown, Indigenous and
Appalachian. Cancer Alley. Eastern Kentucky. Puerto Rico.

Where people are more likely to live near toxic facilities or
environmental waste and less likely to have access to the health care
and legal advocacy necessary to survive. More likely to be paralyzed by
disruptions to public services when violent storms and floods and fires
sweep through and less likely to have the resources to recover. More
likely to see their jobs decimated by our changing energy landscape and
less likely to reap the benefits of new technology, innovation, and
industry.

From environmental crisis to economic exclusion, climate change
exemplifies the far-reaching failures of a government that has refused
to marshal its resources toward the common good---leaving its citizens
vulnerable and inequities deeply rooted.

But [this is also an opportunity to put moral capitalism into
action]{.underline}. We should heed the call for a Green New Deal and
other aggressive climate strategies championed by lifelong advocates,
activists, and elected leaders. These solutions move beyond singular
policy reforms and [mobilize a nationwide response to a worldwide
crisis.]{.underline} They demand we [do more than just react to economic
winds but sound a public call to arms across our entire economy---new
jobs, new technology, new education, new industry, all powerfully backed
by the United States government]{.underline} and aimed at a threat none
of us will escape. Done right, done well, and done boldly, our climate
efforts could reorient our economy around common good, shared survival
... and a future with space for all.

[This is the level of public activism our broken economy demands and our
people deserve.]{.underline} And at this particular moment in history,
we are reminded of exactly what happens if we take another path. If we
choose not to act, someone else will.

Three years ago, a man named Donald Trump usurped America's economic
story. He offered a simple explanation for the hurt so many carry: It's
the other guy's fault. The brown guy. The immigrant. The gay one, the
woman, that one over there, who looks different and sounds funny.
He---like many an aristocrat and supremacist before him---deftly turned
us on each other, defusing the force that abusers of privilege fear
most: solidarity among the people they oppress.

So [Americans today fight each other over the scraps of our system,
instead of uniting to fight a system that finds them worthy of only
scraps to begin with]{.underline}. A system that fails the coal miner in
Harlan forced to defend his hard-earned pension and the nanny in the
Bronx battling for basic benefits. That siphons the livelihood of the
fifth-generation dairy farm in Oshkosh and the first-generation
immigrant business in El Paso.That ignores the profound human cost of
poverty on the reservation in South Dakota and the depleted communities
of Appalachia.

Their stories are different, their experiences distinct. But they share
the burden of a system that leaves most Americans behind. They hail from
places where polling locations suddenly disappear; where payday lenders
prey on local economies; where lead poisons children's water; where
neighborhoods spend years fighting injustice on their own before anyone
in power shows up. They disproportionately shoulder the hard words that
make life hurt---eviction, pollution, addiction, bankruptcy, violence.

They bear the swollen, stubborn scars of a government that has, for much
of a half-century, abdicated its role as guarantor of economic equity
and a country that has made it difficult to be middle-class,
excruciating to be poor, and downright impossible to be poor AND. Poor
and black. Poor and brown. Poor and female. Poor and gay. Poor and sick
or old or addicted.

President Trump has spent two years amassing these economic casualties.
He has built bunkers of privilege throughout government, mighty
fortresses from which he takes aim at those with no shield. But we don't
stand a chance against him until we come together to neutralize the
weapon he depends on most: an economy that keeps most American families
hanging on by the skin of their teeth.

### Perm -- Democracy 

#### Approaches that [eliminate democracy]{.underline} are [worse than capitalism]{.underline} -- the [perm]{.underline} is key to [fight capitalism]{.underline} while [maintaining liberal values]{.underline}

5\. Conclusion [The degrowth movement has developed out of a critique of
modernity\'s hypertrophies]{.underline}. Such critiques often exhibit an
ambivalent stance, implying that some aspects of modernity are to be
kept, others to be rejected. [Nonetheless, the radical currents of
modernity critique within the degrowth movement tend to dismiss the
institutions of liberal democracies as failed, corrupted and
democracy-in-name-only. In contrast, we propose to conceive of degrowth
as a **liberal project**]{.underline} (including the option of radical
change via reform, cf. Gorz, 1964); drawing upon Rorty\'s social hope
based on changing vocabularies and Sen\'s and Habermas\' deliberative
understanding of democracy, [we showed that not only is **this approach
compatible with a liberal conception of democracy**, "not giv\[ing\]
lightly up hope that by such means as argument and careful observation,
people may reach some kind of agreement on many problems of importance;
and that, even where their demands and their interests clash, it is
often possible to argue about the various demands and proposals"
(]{.underline}Popper, 2011\[1945\]: 431); [it also lays out a potential
road towards realization, since by promoting new vocabularies majorities
for the degrowth project can be created.]{.underline} While this
approach explicitly follows Habermas' call to carry on the "unfinished
project of modernity", the resulting degrowth vocabulary might also
productively draw on some aspects of the more radical modernity
critiques that have been exemplarily presented in this paper9:
•Heidegger\'s ethos of releasement has recently been introduced into the
degrowth literature (Heikkurinen, 2016). His (late) writings may further
nurture a vocabulary of self-sufficiency, mindfulness and openness
towards nature. •Marcuse\'s critique of the affluent consumer society
provides less in terms of specific terms and concepts but more in terms
of practice and attitude -- the Habermasian "defence of the lifeworld"
against systemic imperatives may benefit from Marcuse\'s spirit of
refusal. •Illich\'s convivial approach towards social and technological
tools has already been widely received in the degrowth literature (e.g.
Deriu, 2015, Samerski, 2016). On this basis, [technology might be
relegated back to its original function as a means for specific
ends.]{.underline} On a second level, [the degrowth movement may benefit
from the radical critiques of modernity by avoiding to repeat their
mistakes.]{.underline} Specifically, [the main lesson to be drawn is
that existentialist vocabularies]{.underline} (e.g., truth and
authenticity), [if employed in the political domain, may
**unintentionally endanger liberal values** (]{.underline}cf.
Heidegger\'s Nazism and Marcuse\'s non-condemnation of violence).
Therefore, [such vocabularies should be confined to the realm of
self-creation]{.underline} (cf. Illich\'s hope for institutional
inversion), [inspiring the refusal to conform with systemic pressures as
a personal virtue.]{.underline} Let us briefly consider two obvious
objections to the approach sketched here.10 First, [the idea that
changing vocabularies entails changing institutions, naturally sits at
odds with Marx-inspired views that highlight the primacy of economic
structures]{.underline} -- any effort to change vocabularies seems
futile if, by assumption, they only mirror economic structures. By
comparison, the post-Marxist calls for building a new hegemony (e.g.
Laclau and Mouffe, 2000) lie closer to and may even directly relate to
the approach favoured here. Second, [in practice, promotion of
vocabularies proceeds slowly. Political majorities will not be created
quickly.]{.underline} [Hence, it is not certain that the liberal
approach will prevent crossing of planetary boundaries in time or that
it will achieve all of degrowth\'s goals]{.underline}.11 [Still, given
that many of these goals are related to human autonomy, freedom and
"good life", it would be unwise to throw out the]{.underline} "baby"
(i.e. [the constitutive elements of a liberal democracy]{.underline}, as
defined in Section 1) [with]{.underline} the "bathwater" (i.e.
[modernity\'s hypertrophies such as excessive instrumental
rationalism]{.underline}). Particularly, the third element of liberal
democracy, i.e. [institutions that allow for corrections of the societal
course of action on the basis of public discourse, may inadvertently
come under pressure if a there-is-no-sustainable-alternative mantra were
to substitute for the neoliberal there-is-no-alternative
mantra]{.underline} (Buch-Hansen, 2014: 172). [This seems all the more
important because degrowth\'s grassroots origins notwithstanding, "the
majority of degrowth proposals \[...\] follow a top-down approach" in
that they "**require direct control by governments** \[...\], which
suggests the need for a high level of state intervention to pursue a
degrowth transition]{.underline}" (Cosme et al., 2017: 149). As regards
the prospects for such political interventions, we agree with Kallis et
al. (2012:178) that radicalism may play an important strategic role,
too: What about labour and women rights, the 40 hours\' workweek, social
security or free healthcare? Weren\'t these unthinkable reforms at the
time that compromised the profits of powerful vested interests? \[...\]
In many cases such radical agendas have come through electoral and
social pressure \[...\] it takes radical agendas to take power in order
to bring about reformist policies. In a sense, this paper fosters and
sharpens this message: [the degrowth movement rightly aims to correct
the hypertrophies of modernity but it should be more explicit about i)
which of liberal democracy\'s and, more generally, modernity\'s basic
tenets it intends to keep and ii) how this is to be
ensured.]{.underline} Eventually, [the spectre of authoritarianism is
often quite clear to see for those who want to see it]{.underline}.
Consider that already in 1918, the socialist revolutionary Rosa
Luxembourg condemned the Bolsheviks' dissolution of the Russian
Constituent Assembly in Saint Petersburg -- her [clear-sighted judgement
should alert all those who casually dismiss currently existing liberal
democracies as failed]{.underline}12: To be sure, every democratic
institution has its limits and shortcomings, things which it doubtless
shares with all other human institutions. [But the]{.underline} remedy
which Trotsky and Lenin have found, the [elimination of democracy as
such, is worse than the disease it is supposed to cure; for it stops up
the very living source from which alone can come correction of all the
innate shortcomings of social institutions. That source is the active,
untrammeled, energetic political life of the broadest masses of the
people.]{.underline}
