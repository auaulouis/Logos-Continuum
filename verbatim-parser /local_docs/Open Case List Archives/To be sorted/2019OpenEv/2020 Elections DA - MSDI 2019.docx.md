Aaron **Blake, 2018**, 11-4-2018, senior political reporter, \" Could
Losing The House Actually Help Trump In 2020\",

We're now three days from the 2018 election --- an election in which
Republicans appear likely to lose the House. The funny thing is that
President Trump seems at peace with that. His late strategy seems to be
all about motivating the base for key red-state Senate races. He is
focused on that even though that rhetoric seems less helpful --- and
possibly even harmful --- in the more endangered chamber, the House. "It
could happen," Trump said Friday about losing the House. "And you know
what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? 'Don't worry about it,
I'll just figure it out.' Does that make sense? I'll figure it out." An
election analyst might say he is conceding the House. A conspiracy
theorist might say he sees benefit --- personally, at least --- in
losing the House. **[There are very obvious downsides to Republicans\'
losing the House for Trump]{.underline}**. Chief among them is that
Democrats could leverage their newfound subpoena power to investigate
his administration. They could possibly even obtain those tax returns
that Trump clearly does not want us to see and expose what the New York
Times has said are fraudulent tax schemes. He would also be losing the
ability to pass legislation without Democratic votes, a setup that gave
him a signature tax-cut bill and at least a shot at other victories ---
a chance that could vanish the moment Democrats control the agenda in
half of Congress. But [if you are looking at this]{.underline} purely
[from the vantage point of Trump's self-interest]{.underline} ---
[particularly as it]{.underline} **[relates to winning reelection in
2020]{.underline}** --- there is a compelling case to be made [that [a
Dem]{.mark}ocratic [House might be a good]{.mark} [thing]{.mark} for the
president. The first reason is that]{.underline} [voters seem to like
divided government]{.underline}. [Of the last six presidents to
win]{.underline} [reelection]{.underline} since World War II, [only one
had complete control of Congress]{.underline} --- George W. Bush in
2004. In 1996, 1988, 1980, 1972, 1968 and 1956, one party controlled all
of Congress, but voters picked the other party for the White House. [The
second is that]{.underline} [[it gives Trump a
boogeyman]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [or, more apt, a boogeywoman. It's
one thing to campaign against]{.underline} House Minority Leader Nancy
[Pelosi]{.underline} (Calif.) [by warning that she could become
speaker]{.underline}; [it's another to do so if she is
speaker]{.underline}. [If **Democrats win the House, [Trump will have a
ready-made foil for his]{.mark} 2020 reelection
[campaign]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [even if his Democratic opponent is
not such a lightning rod. [Trump]{.mark} [could]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[blame the]{.underline}]{.mark} Democratic [[House]{.underline}
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [[his]{.underline}]{.mark} continued
[[failures to live up to his]{.underline}]{.mark} many, many
[[promises]{.underline}]{.mark}. (He has already done this to some
degree, even though Democrats have no control over any branch of
government.) Trump has fulfilled some promises, but key ones and
far-fetched ones such as the border wall (not to mention making Mexico
pay for it) remain improbable even if Republicans keep control of the
House and Senate. [If you are going to have gridlock, you might as well
have someone on which to blame it who is not in your own
party.]{.underline} And, finally, even that [subpoena power could
pose]{.underline} some [tough choices for Democrats]{.underline}. [There
will be [pressure]{.mark} from the party's base [to go after Trump
hard]{.mark} and]{.underline} even [impeach him]{.underline}, [but we've
seen how that **[can lead to overreach]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [most
notably]{.underline}, [when Republicans impeached]{.underline} Bill
[Clinton]{.underline} in the late 1990s. And [Democratic leaders have
already telegraphed a wariness about that]{.underline}. [What happens
when]{.underline} they actually have power and the [base wants them to
go further than they think is prudent]{.underline}? That doesn't mean
they will go too far, but there's a clear tension. This is all
speculative, yes. It is just as probable that Trump is campaigning so
much for Senate candidates because he and the people around him
recognize he is much better as a base motivator than a swing-voter
winner. You get more bang for your buck as president campaigning in one
of 35 Senate races than in one of 435 House races. But it is also true
that Trump's closing message is of much more questionable utility when
it comes to saving the House, and he does not seem to care much about
that, even though it would ostensibly be a major setback for his agenda.
This is also a president who has generally looked out for himself rather
than his recently adopted political party, and it is not unreasonable to
ask whether he truly cares about the fate of that party --- especially
if its **[[setback could be his own personal
gain]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Trump 2020 victory locks in catastrophic climate change

Of all the questions that will be answered by the 2020 election, one
matters above the others: [Is Trumpism a temporary aberration or a
long-term phenomenon]{.underline}? Put another way: [Will the changes
brought about by Donald Trump and today's Republican Party fade away, or
will they **become entrenched**?]{.underline} Trump's reelection seems
implausible to many people, as implausible as his election did before
November 2016. But despite the scandals and chaos of his presidency, and
despite his party's midterm losses, he approaches 2020 with two factors
in his favor. One is incumbency: Since 1980, voters have only once
denied an incumbent a second term. The other is a relatively strong
economy (at least as of now). Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at
Emory University who weights both of those factors heavily in his
election-forecasting model, gives Trump close to an even chance of
reelection, based on a projected 2 percent GDP growth rate for the first
half of 2020. [So far, much of the concern about the long-term effects
of Trump's presidency has centered on his antidemocratic
tendencies]{.underline}. [But even if we take those off the table---even
if we assume that Trump continues to be hemmed in by other parts of the
government and by outside institutions, and that he governs no more
effectively than he has until now]{.underline}---[**the impact of a
second term would be more lasting than that of the first.** In normal
politics]{.underline}, the policies adopted by a president and Congress
may zig one way, and those of the next president and Congress may zag
the other. The contending parties take our system's rules as a given,
and fight over what they understand to be reversible policies and power
arrangements. But some situations are not like that; a zig one way makes
it hard to zag back. This is one of those moments. [[After four years as
president, Trump]{.mark} will have made at least two Supreme Court
appointments, signed into law tax cuts, and rolled back federal
regulation of the environment and the economy]{.underline}. [Whatever
you think of these [actions]{.mark}, **many of them [can]{.mark}
probably [be offset or]{.mark} entirely [undone]{.mark} in the future**.
The effects of [a **full eight years of Trump will be**]{.mark} **much
more difficult, if not [impossible]{.mark}, [to undo.]{.mark}** Three
areas---climate change, the risk of a renewed global arms race, and
control of the Supreme Court]{.underline}---[illustrate the historic
significance of the 2020 election]{.underline}. **[The first two
problems will become much harder to address as time goes
on]{.underline}**. The third one stands to remake our constitutional
democracy and undermine the capacity for future change. In short, [the
biggest difference between electing Trump in 2016 and reelecting Trump
in 2020 would be irreversibility. [Climate policy is]{.mark} now [the
**most obvious example**]{.mark}. For a long time, even many of the
people who acknowledged the reality of climate change thought of it as a
slow process that did not demand immediate action.]{.underline} But
today[, amid extreme weather events and worsening scientific forecasts,
**[the costs of our delay are]{.mark} clearly [mounting]{.mark}, as are
the associated dangers.**]{.underline} [T[o have a chance at keeping
global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius]{.underline}]{.mark}[---the
objective of the Paris climate agreement---the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change says that [by 2030,]{.mark} **[CO2 emissions must drop
some 45 percent]{.mark} from 2010 levels. Instead of declining, however,
they are rising**. In his first term, [Trump]{.mark} [has]{.mark}
announced [plans to cancel]{.mark} existing [climate reforms]{.mark},
such as higher fuel-efficiency standards and limits on emissions from
new coal-fired power plants, [and]{.mark} he has pledged to
[pull]{.mark} the United States [out of the Paris
Agreement]{.mark}.]{.underline} [**His [reelection]{.mark} [would put
off]{.mark} a national commitment to [decarbonization]{.mark}
[until]{.mark} at least [the second half of the 2020s,]{.mark}** while
[encouraging other countries to do nothing as
well]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} And change that is delayed becomes
more economically and politically difficult. According to the Global
Carbon Project, [if decarbonization had begun globally in 2000, an
emissions reduction of about 2 percent a year would have been sufficient
to stay below 2 degrees Celsius of warming]{.underline}. **[Now it will
need to be approximately 5 percent a ye]{.underline}**ar. [[If we
wait]{.mark} another decade, it will be about 9 percent. In the United
States, [the economic disruption and popular resistance]{.mark} sure to
arise from such an abrupt transition [may be more than our political
system can bear]{.mark}. No one knows, moreover, **when [the world might
hit irreversible]{.mark} [tipping points]{.mark} such as the collapse**
of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would likely **doom us to a
catastrophic sea-level rise**.]{.underline}

polling, explained.
<https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/17/18681965/2020-presidential-election-polls-trump-biden-warren>

Now to the president. As [Vox's Matt Yglesias covered last
week](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18662196/trump-popularity-poll-democrats-2020),
[[Trump's reelection odds certainly appear bleak]{.underline}]{.mark}
based on hypothetical head-to-head matchups with the top 2020 Democratic
candidates: If you look at Donald Trump's polling lately, it sure looks
like [[he's in trouble for reelection]{.underline}]{.mark}. A [June 11
Quinnipiac
poll](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2627) showed
Trump losing 40-53 to Joe Biden. He's also down 51-42 to Bernie Sanders,
41-49 to Kamala Harris, 42-49 to Elizabeth Warren, 42-47 to Pete
Buttigieg, and 42-47 to Cory Booker. [[All plausible contenders at this
moment can take heart in the fact that just 40 to 42 percent of the
population feels like voting for Trump's
reelection]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The public is mostly saying they want
to vote for any Democrat,]{.underline}]{.mark} and the strongest pattern
so far indicates better-known Democrats do better than the more obscure
ones. None of this means that Trump is a sure bet to lose the election
in 2020 --- public opinion can change fast and there's nothing
particularly predictive about polling this far out --- but it's a pretty
clear snapshot of public opinion right now. The Trump 2020 campaign's
own internal polling also keeps leaking to political reporters and it
also doesn't look good: ABC News says that it has the data from Trump\'s
first internal reelection campaign poll. It found: Biden leading Trump
by 16 in Pennsylvania Biden leading Trump by 10 in Wisconsin Biden
leading Trump by 7 in Florida Trump leading Biden by 2 in
Texas[https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trumps-internal-polling-data-march-showed-joe/story?id=63718268
...](https://t.co/Ked9afCY8r) (The Trump campaign has said those numbers
are out of date, and Trump has disavowed them on Twitter, with news
emerging that [he has fired several of his
pollsters](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html)
over the leaks.) Now you, as a wise and seasoned monitor of campaign
polls, might think it is ridiculous to be polling November 2020 general
election matchups in June 2019 before the first Democratic primary
debates and you, dear reader, would be right to think that. But some of
the other indicators for Trump's reelection are equally dismal. [[Trump
is still [really
unpopular](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html)]{.underline}]{.mark}.
He's generally quite unpopular [[in the most important electoral
battleground states]{.underline}]{.mark} too. Here are the raw numbers
for Trump in the states that are expected to be competitive in the 2020
election, according to [the latest Morning Consult
data](https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trump/): New Hampshire: 39
percent approval, 58 percent disapproval Wisconsin: 42 percent approval,
55 percent disapproval Michigan: 42 percent approval, 54 percent
disapproval Iowa: 42 percent approval, 54 percent disapproval Arizona:
45 percent approval, 51 percent disapproval Pennsylvania 45 percent
approval, 52 percent disapproval Ohio: 46 percent approval, 50 percent
disapproval North Carolina: 46 percent approval, 50 percent disapproval
Florida: 48 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval Indiana: 49 percent
approval, 46 percent disapproval It's a grim picture. Wisconsin and
Michigan were critical Midwestern pieces of Trump's Electoral College
puzzle, and he is now deeply unpopular in both states. Pennsylvania was
maybe his most surprising win in 2016, and now he is 7 points underwater
there. Perhaps Trump can take solace in his even job approval rating in
Florida, but that is the only swing state where the president looks as
strong as he did on Election Day 2016. Everywhere else, his support has
deteriorated. Maybe the most striking finding is in Iowa, where Trump
beat Hillary Clinton by nearly 10 points. Iowans disapprove of his job
performance by a 12-point margin now, in a farming state that's been hit
hard by Trump's trade war. That would suggest the president's cult of
personality will not totally inoculate him from the unpopular parts of
his policy agenda. We still have a year and a half to go before the 2020
election. [[These approval numbers]{.underline}]{.mark} aren't the same
as a head-to-head matchup with a specific Democratic candidate (though
those have not been very encouraging for Trump either). But they do
[[indicate the unusual weakness of the president heading into his
reelection campaign.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Dems will win -- polls, battleground state data, and electoral vote projections

**[John Harwood](https://www.cnbc.com/john-harwood/) June 18 2019**
Trump is Wall Street's favorite to win in 2020, but his reelection
prospects look bad in state polls PUBLISHED TUE, JUN 18 2019 5:01 PM

<https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/trump-reelection-chances-look-bad-in-state-polls.html>

But [[a look at state-by-state data clarifies the scale of Trump's
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the [president tries to rally
supporters at a 2020 kickoff rally in Orlando on
Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/trump-launches-2020-election-campaign-with-orlando-florida-rally.html),
[[he is fighting from behind]{.underline}]{.mark}. A new Quinnipiac
University poll of Florida showed the president trailing former Vice
President Joe Biden by nine percentage points, 50%-41%, in their
potential matchup for that state's 29 electoral votes. Trump also
trailed other possible Democratic nominees, including Bernie Sanders and
Elizabeth Warren. Last week, a veteran Michigan pollster showed Trump
trailing Biden by 11 points for that state's 16 electoral votes. Before
that, statewide polls in North Carolina and Texas showed Biden ahead by
12 and four percentage points, respectively. Trump carried all those
states in 2016, and could do it again in 2020. Polls four years ago
showed Trump way behind Hillary Clinton. Sixteen months of campaigning
remain. But [[the data show that Trump will have to climb out of the
deep hole he has dug for himself]{.underline}]{.mark} in nearly two and
one-half years in office. Americans know him much better than they did
in 2015 -- and not in a good way. [[Despite a strong
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, this week's NBC News/Wall Street Journal
national survey shows that [[62% of Americans report themselves
uncomfortable or with reservations about a second Trump
term]{.underline}]{.mark}; 52% called themselves "very uncomfortable."
[[A Fox News poll showed every major Democratic candidate ahead of
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} -- Biden by 10 percentage points. Of course,
results in battleground states determine the Electoral College winner.
That's how Trump, while losing the popular vote to Clinton, reached the
Oval Office in the first place. Yet [[key battlegrounds have grown
increasingly unhappy with him]{.underline}]{.mark}. This far from
Election Day, with the Democratic nominee still unknown, the best
measurement comes from his approval ratings in those places. The polling
firm Morning Consult continually measures state-level presidential
approval. Its latest calculations show that Trump's net approval has
declined in all 50 of them. That poses particular problems in the three
battleground states where his narrow 2016 victories moved him past the
270 electoral votes needed to win: Michigan (16), Wisconsin (10) and
Pennsylvania (20). In Michigan, the firm shows Trump with approval of
42%, disapproval of 54%. That net-negative of 12 percentage points is 20
points worse than in January 2017. In Wisconsin, his net-disapproval
stands at 13 percentage points -- 19 points worse than the start of his
term. In Pennsylvania, he's underwater by 7 points, an erosion of 17
points since the start of his presidency. Indeed, Trump currently faces
net-negative job approval rating in 27 states with 328 electoral votes.
Add Florida, where he breaks even on job approval but trails in the
Quinnipiac Poll, and [[the eventual Democratic nominee would hold a
strong chance of winning 358 electoral votes]{.underline}]{.mark}. At
this point, there's little reason to expect such a lopsided result. No
Democrat can count on winning Arizona (where Trump's net-disapproval is
6 percentage points), Ohio (-4 points), North Carolina (-4) or even Iowa
(-12). But [[winning will require Trump to make up ground across the
electoral map at a time when signs point to slowing economic
growth]{.mark}]{.underline} and, in personal terms, the public views him
negatively.

#### Dems will win -- Trump trails all dem rivals

<https://www.salon.com/2019/06/25/president-trump-trails-all-democratic-rivals-in-new-head-to-head-matchups-of-2020-race/>

President Donald [[Trump trails all of his Democratic rivals in
hypothetical matchups of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[2020]{.underline}]{.mark} presidential race, according to the result
of a new poll released Tuesday. [The survey, conducted by Emerson
Polling](https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/june-national-poll-all-eyes-on-the-democratic-debates-biden-sanders-and-warren-separate-from-the-field),
found that the president lags behind former vice president Joe Biden and
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., by 10 points nationally --- 45 percent to 55
percent. He also trails Sen. Elizabeth Warren by six points --- 47
percent to 53 percent ---and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South
Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg by four points --- 48 percent to 52
percent. In regards to the crowded Democratic primary field, Spencer
Kimball, director of the Emerson Poll, pointed out: \"Similar to our
other polls, Biden and Sanders voters are the most loyal with 50 percent
to 55 percent saying they are set on their candidates.\"
\"Comparatively, 33 percent of Warren, 18 percent of Harris and 17
percent of Buttigieg voters say they will stick with their current
choices,\" he added. \"This suggests that about 30 percent of the
Democratic electorate are spoken for and another 30 percent leaning
toward the top two candidates as of now leaves a narrow lane for another
candidate to grab a plurality of the vote.\" [[The survey also showed
that Trump maintains a steady approval rating of 43 percent, while his
disapproval rating has dropping one point since last month to 48
percent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Fox News](https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/fox-news) host [Chris

[[there's no way [Donald

president doesn't seem to care about anyone else now. Smith asked if
Trump is simply going to "stay with the base, placate the base and
forget everybody else and just figure out a way come 2020?" "You can't
do it," Wallace responded, "because there's just not enough votes in the
base." E[[ven with polling that indicates as much as 40 percent of
eligible voters may be "ever-Trumpers]{.underline}]{.mark}," [[that's
"not enough to win an election]{.underline}]{.mark}," Wallace
emphasized. "So he's going to have to expand his base." While his
backers love his [border
wall](https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/border-wall), it's not popular
with the majority of Americans, Wallace noted[[. He's going to need the
"independents \... suburban Republicans, suburban
women]{.underline}]{.mark}," Wallace added. He suspects Trump hopes the
Democrats will nominate someone "so far to the left \... that it's going
to make it easier for him; he doesn't have to pivot as far to the
center" to pick up some of that support, Wallace added.

#### Trump loses 2020 now\-\--suburban voters collapse the coalition he needs for an electoral college victory

Tim **Mullaney, 18**, 11-7-2018, \"How Trump lost (and why it will get
worse)\",
\[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-trump-lost-and-why-it-will-get-worse-2018-11-07\],
AVD

Worse, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} cobbled-together
[[coalition]{.underline}]{.mark} of states [[that let Trump]{.mark}
squeak to his]{.underline} Electoral College [[win]{.underline}]{.mark}
disappeared --- and [[showed **signs of
collapsing**]{.underline}]{.mark} altogether **[[by
2020]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is not what you'll hear from a
president who routinely, and falsely, claims his Electoral College win
was historically large. [He won]{.underline} 306 electoral votes in 2016
[by winning stunning, [**narrow** victories in **Wisconsin, Michigan and
Pennsylvania**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a total of 36 electoral votes.
That's exactly the 36 votes he won over and above the 270 he needed to
win. [[**All three**]{.mark} states [elected]{.mark}
**[Dem]{.mark}**ocratic **[governors]{.mark}** Tuesday]{.underline}, two
of them handily. (Tony Evers squeaked to a win over Republican incumbent
Scott Walker in Wisconsin, as expected). [**All three** re-elected
**Dem**ocratic **[senators]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ohio, an industrial
state that Trump won big, easily re-elected a Democratic senator and
elected a GOP governor, in a mild upset, who's much closer,
ideologically and temperamentally, to outgoing Gov. John Kasich, who
openly loathes Trump. Pennsylvania flipped three suburban House seats to
Democrats. And Iowa, which swung hard to Trump on the backs of older
voters in 2016 after supporting Democrats for president every election
since 1984 except one, turned out two GOP House incumbents. The only
Iowa Republican in the next House will be Steve King, the noted bigot
and ogler of European neo-Nazi parties. All that leaves Trump six votes
short of a coalition even if he hangs on to Ohio. He's down to 246 if he
doesn't. And it gets worse. [Trump's political challenge has always been
that he's attempting to build a coalition all but **exclusively of
yesterday's men**.]{.underline} (Yes, I do mean men). And that only got
worse yesterday. [[In **state after state**]{.mark},
[Republicans]{.mark} did even [worse than]{.mark} Trump did in [2016 in
the **suburbs**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and made up part of the difference
by doing even better in rural areas and some exurbs. [Problem is,
**suburbs are [where population]{.mark}**]{.underline}, wealth and power
[**[are growing]{.underline}**]{.mark} in America. [And with Trump
likely to spend the next two years acting just as **divisively** as in
the last two, [**he's not likely to get**]{.mark} a lot [**more
popular** with]{.mark} the [educated folks]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially white women, among whom he got clobbered Tuesday. Dismiss, if
you want, all the suburban House seats lost in California, New Jersey
and New York as coming from states Trump won't contest in 2020 anyway,
But [Republicans should be **super-afraid** of the three seats they lost
in Virginia]{.underline} --- not just the one in Washington's suburbs
they knew they would lose, but the one in a military district including
Virginia Beach and the one around Richmond where only four years ago
ex-House Minority Leader Eric Cantor lost a primary challenge from his
right. [[Those have been core GOP areas --- but]{.underline}]{.mark} the
logic of [[suburbanization]{.underline}]{.mark}, complete with a rising
percentage of the female white college graduates who disapprove of Trump
by wide margins, and especially of immigrants, [[means they are
getting]{.mark} more]{.underline} important and more [[dangerous]{.mark}
to the GOP]{.underline}. And [Trump should be terrified that Democrat
Stacey Abrams won 56% of Gwinnett County]{.underline}, with 920,000
people [the largest suburban county in Georgia]{.underline}, in the
state's still-undecided governor's race. Gwinnett rarely if ever voted
Democratic for president before Hillary Clinton, who won 51%, and has
grown by 115,000 people since 2010. Nearby Cobb County,with 755,000
people and Newt Gingrich's old geographic base, gave Abrams almost 54%.
The area appears to have split its two House seats, both now represented
by Republicans, though both races are very close. Demographically, the
districts won't be close for long. [[**The president should be
petrified** that]{.mark} Beto O'Rourke's unsuccessful Senate bid in
[Texas delivered enough turnout to topple veteran]{.mark} House
[Republicans in suburban Houston and Dallas]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump
won Texas by nine points. Last night, Sen. Ted Cruz won re-election by
two and a half. [Arguing with demographic change is like arguing with
gravity]{.underline}. Even for a president who disputes climate change,
another inconvenient bit of science, it ain't gonna work. [Trump is
incapable of recognizing that he needs to stop alienating the
suburbs]{.underline} --- by demonizing immigrants, trying to cut health
insurance, disrespecting women and redistributing income to the rich.
[**[Chances are outstanding]{.mark}** he will keep doing exactly what
lost his party the House. And **[Trump will lose in
2020]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### A2: Incumbent

#### Trump will lose despite being the incumbent

Jonah **Goldberg, 18**, 12-14-2018, \"Maybe Trump can\'t win in 2020,
but Democrats can lose\",

AVD

[Donald **[Trump]{.mark} probably [can't]{.mark} [win]{.mark}** the 2020
presidential election, **[but]{.mark} the [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}
[can lose]{.mark}** it.]{.underline} What I mean is that in a contest
[between Trump and a generic Democrat, [Trump would almost surely lose
if the current political climate holds through
2020]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to a Fox News poll released
Wednesday, 38 percent of respondents said they would "definitely" or
"probably" vote for Trump, while 55 percent said they would "definitely"
or "probably" vote for someone else. Trump's boosters are often quick to
dismiss the polls, claiming they were wrong in 2016, when everyone said
he had no chance of winning. The problem with this defense is that the
national polls were actually pretty accurate in 2016. If you average out
the 13 final national polls of 2016, they showed Hillary Clinton ahead
by 3.1 percentage points. She won the popular vote --- the only thing
national polls measure --- by 2.1 percentage points. Trump carried the
Electoral College because he won Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by 0.7
points each and Michigan by 0.2 points. A mere 78,000 votes carried the
day. Most presidents work assiduously to build on the coalition that
brought them to power. President [Trump has done almost the opposite,
catering to his base while doing almost everything he can to alienate
suburban Republicans and independents, which is why the GOP got
shellacked in the midterms.]{.underline} So [[if Trump
runs]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which is probably a bigger "if" than many
people think --- [[the cards are stacked against him.]{.mark}
Fortunately for him, the Democrats will not nominate someone named
Generic Democrat.]{.underline} Instead, the Democrats are poised to
re-create the same dynamic that got Trump the GOP nomination in the
first place. While it's technically true that Trump beat 16 opponents,
as he likes to say, the truth is a bit more complicated. Trump never won
a majority of votes in the primaries. He benefited from a
collective-action problem in which various candidates defeated each
other while a sticky plurality of voters stuck with Trump. [If the field
had been narrower, with only two or three contenders other than Trump,
his base of support might not have been enough. But with each additional
player, the number of votes he needed to win shrank.]{.underline} Right
now, it's almost easier to list the number of prominent Democrats who
aren't thinking of running. No one knows for sure, but estimates on the
number of potential Democratic candidates range from 20 to 40. In that
kind of field, the ability to attract a small but passionate cadre of
supporters will be more important than arguments about electability.
Thus, there will be an enormous incentive to replicate the Trump model
of taking unorthodox positions, stated as boldly as possible, in order
to win over the most passionate ideologues and activists. Moreover, the
mood among Democrats is more than a little analogous to the mood among
Republicans in 2016. Hillary Clinton was a uniquely disliked and feared
figure among conservatives. The argument that America would be "over" if
she won found purchase among millions of Republican voters. One need
only listen to a few minutes of discussion on CNN or MSNBC, or to read
the op-ed pages on almost any given day, to see that a similar attitude
is widespread among Democrats. If you can't imagine chants of "Lock him
up!" at the Democratic convention in 2020, you haven't been paying
attention. Thus, the odds that the Democrats will elect their own Trump
are very high. Of course, the one thing Trump fans and foes alike can
agree on is that Trump is a unique political personality. But a
Democratic candidate could substitute policy outlandishness for personal
outlandishness quite easily. Many in the Democratic base could easily
rally to someone promising to abolish ICE, deliver "Medicare-for-all,"
repeal the Second Amendment, whatever. [[That would give Trump the
ability to]{.mark} [persuade]{.mark} many otherwise hostile voters to
cast ballots [against the Democrats rather than for the
incumbent]{.mark}.]{.underline} He can't win, but they can still lose.

### A2 Thumpers - general

#### No thumpers\-\--Trump [MUST]{.underline} shift the narrative to get re-elected\-\--but there's zero chance he does that in the status quo.

**Yglesias 18** (Matthew Yglesias, 11-14-2018, \"What the 2018 results

That's frustrating to Democrats, who feel in their bones that his
numbers should be in the cellar. But it really ought to scare
Republicans, because [[**his holding pattern** in the **low 40s** puts
them on track to **lose in 2020**]{.mark}.]{.underline} More than
anything else, that is the lesson of the midterms. [Trump's numbers were

like,]{.underline} [with Democrats beating Republicans badly enough that
the geographical details didn't matter very much]{.underline}. [[Two
years is plenty of time for **Trump to turn** that **around** and
**become more popular**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[if he]{.mark} [wants to get reelected]{.mark}, [he does need to

### A2: Thumper\-\--Econ

#### Trump is unique\-\--the economy is less important and won't decide the election.

a Recession\",

President Donald Trump's advisers are rattled. Not because the second
year of his presidency is about to end with little to show for itself.
Or because the Mueller investigation is
[intensifying](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/12/mueller-flynn-russia-collusion.html)
and continues to ensnare people close to the president. Or because Trump
is historically unpopular, with an approval rating that has [never even
hit 50
percent](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo).
Or even because the Republican Party was just handed [a historic
defeat](https://www.axios.com/2018-midterm-elections-democrats-won-house-biggest-margin-a56a1049-8823-4667-8d81-2c67ef3f36f4.html)
in the midterm elections. On Friday, [Politico
[reported](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/07/trump-2020-election-economy-recession-trade-war-1048197)]{.underline}
that "Trump's economic officials are reassuring investors about recent
white-knuckle stock market volatility, while [Trump's]{.underline}
political advisers are increasingly alarmed that the economy could
present a stiff 2020 campaign headwind.... allies acknowledge that his
[reelection prospects hinge in large part on [how Americans
judge]{.mark} their [economic prospects at the]{.mark} time [of
the]{.mark} next [election]{.mark}." This [has been the **conventional
wisdom**]{.mark}]{.underline} in American politics [for some
time]{.underline}: that citizens cast their votes based on their
economic well-being. There's a reason why [["It's the economy,
stupid"]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid)
[is one of Washington's most persistent cliches.]{.underline} But
[[Trump has **defied** all sorts of **conventional**]{.mark}
**[wisdom]{.mark}** to date.]{.underline} For starters, he defeated the
nominee of the party that oversaw America's recovery from the Great
Recession; by the 2016 election, the economy had been expanding for
seven straight years. That trend has continued under Trump---the economy
was even [historically
great](https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/30/news/economy/us-economy-boom-history/index.html)
last year---and yet, his approval rating has been [mired in the
low-40s](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo).
[[A recession]{.mark} almost certainly [wouldn't]{.mark} [help]{.mark}
Trump's reelection chances, [but]{.mark} [**it seems like an
overreaction** to pin his]{.mark} political [future on]{.mark}
[whether]{.mark} or not [one occurs]{.mark} in the next eighteen
months.]{.underline} There's limited evidence that a recession would
doom Trump. A sitting president hasn't run for reelection in the midst
of a recession since Jimmy Carter in 1980, as CNBC's John Harwood
[pointed
out](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/06/trump-may-be-first-president-since-carter-to-seek-reelection-in-recession.html)
on Thursday. Carter, of course, lost in historic fashion, with Ronald
Reagan taking 44 of 50 states in the Electoral College. [Other
[recent]{.mark} [presidents who saw recessions]{.mark}]{.underline} in
their first term---Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, George W.
Bush---[[survived]{.underline}]{.mark}, though those recessions had all
ended by election day, Harwood noted. But there is reason to fear a
recession. The economic recovery has been unusually long---the
[second-longest
expansion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-01/as-u-s-expansion-hits-endurance-milestone-here-s-what-s-next)
in U.S. history, after 1991-2001. Last year's enormous corporate tax
cuts provided a shot in the arm for the economy, but its effects are
wearing off as warning signs mount. "A strong dollar, weaker growth
abroad, mounting corporate debt, a slowdown in housing and the ongoing
havoc that tariffs are wreaking on global supply chains are each taking
a toll," [wrote Diane
Swonk](https://www.grantthornton.com/library/articles/advisory/2018/economic-analysis/economic-outlook/economic-outlook-december-2018.aspx),
chief economist for Grant Thornton LLP. "No one knows for sure which
straw will break the camel's back, only that they are piling up." [Trump
would certainly own any recession that occurred in the next few
years]{.underline}. His economic protectionism has [spooked global
markets](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/9/17955106/imf-economy-trump-trade-war-growth)
and damaged relationships with key allies and trading partners. The
administration's [weak-dollar
policies](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/25/trump-weak-dollar-policy-could-kill-economy-analyst-bove-says.html)
and financial regulatory rollbacks would also be
[blamed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trump-administration-is-making-our-next-recession-worse/2018/06/05/ad6a48f4-6051-11e8-b2b8-08a538d9dbd6_story.html?utm_term=.2adbfbcc00a5)
for making any economic slowdown worse. [But **[being
responsible]{.mark}**]{.underline} for something [[and **being
punished**]{.mark} **for it [politically]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} **two
[different]{.mark} things.**]{.underline} The [[[economic
indicators]{.mark}](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hillary-clinton-will-win-in-november-says-the-economy-2016-05-25)
heading [in]{.mark}to the [2016]{.mark}]{.underline} election
[[suggested]{.mark} that [Trump should
lose]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The economy, taken broadly, was
doing quite well under Democratic leadership and Hillary Clinton had
pledged to largely continue President Barack Obama's economic policies.
Polls suggested that the majority of people felt good about the economy
and their place in it. But Trump, who consistently painted a bleak and
inaccurate picture of the economy under Obama, prevailed nevertheless.
Of course, Trump won partly by appealing to people who had been left
behind by the economic recovery. As the economy has continued to grow,
though, Trump's approval rating has [remained in the low
40s](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/). A
Quinnipiac poll released late last month revealed that 53 percent of
voters approved of Trump's handling of the economy, but only 41 percent
approved of Trump overall. The last few years have revealed that [[there
are **partisan correlations** on **economic
polling**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[Republicans tend to think the economy
is doing well when a Republican is in office, and vice
versa]{.underline}---but these are still staggering numbers, given the
aggregate economic numbers. A recession, Politico reported, "could be
the biggest threat to Trump's chances at winning a second term,
according to interviews with eight current and former senior
administration officials and close White House advisers." What should
really trouble those officials and advisers, though, is that Trump
hasn't seen any political benefit for the performance of the economy so
far. [[The real problem]{.mark} facing Trump ahead of 2020 isn't the
economy, stupid. **[It's that a]{.mark} clear [majority dislikes
him]{.mark}**,]{.underline} no matter what.

On this day four years ago, roughly two years before the 2016

field for the Republican presidential nomination. Donald Trump didn't

Then again, history was no real guide in 2016.

#### That's key\-\--early campaigning has a statistically [significant effect]{.underline} on final results.

Elections Engage the Electorate", January 2017, American Politics
Research, Volume: 45 issue: 2, page(s): 186-223)

In this article, [[we take **a long view** of the]{.mark} mobilizing
effects of the [presidential]{.mark} [campaign
season]{.mark}]{.underline}. We demonstrate that feelings about the
candidates and campaign communications early in the primary season, as
well as late in the general election campaign, mobilize citizens during
the fall campaign. [These findings emerge from a six-wave panel of
potential voters during]{.underline} the [2008]{.underline} presidential
campaign [involving more than **10,000 respondents**.]{.underline}
**[[This is an ideal dataset]{.underline}]{.mark}** to explore
individual-level variation across the length of the campaign. We know
that [[campaigns]{.mark} and candidates]{.underline} are able to
activate potential voters by [[reaching out to]{.underline}]{.mark} them
directly (e.g., [Gerber & Green,
2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezp.lib.rochester.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X16677278?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider);
[Nickerson & Rogers,
2014](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezp.lib.rochester.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X16677278?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
However, we build on these findings by demonstrating that
[[individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}, who are contacted by campaigns
during the primaries[, [**months prior**]{.mark} to the **beginning of
the general election** campaign]{.underline}, [[are **significantly more
likely** to **participate** in the **fall**]{.mark} **general
election**]{.underline}. This finding is new and drives home the
importance of asking voters directly to participate in the campaign
process, **[irrespective of the propinquity of Election
Day]{.underline}**. [Furthermore, scholars have determined **citizens'
exposure to campaigns**]{.underline}, and candidate information [leads
to higher levels of engagement]{.underline} by potential voters (e.g.,
[Kahn & Kenney,
1999](https://journals-sagepub-com.ezp.lib.rochester.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X16677278?utm_source=summon&utm_medium=discovery-provider)).
These findings, however, come exclusively from general election
campaigns. Again, we demonstrate that the importance of examining the
entire campaign by showing [exposure to [advertisements **during the
primaries** translate]{.mark}s [to **higher**]{.mark} **levels of voter
[engagement]{.mark}** [in the **fall**]{.mark} campaign]{.underline}.
Exposure to primary campaign messages, measured as early as March, is
linked in significant ways to the likelihood of engagement in the
general election. [This relationship holds true even controlling for
exposure to political advertisements during the fall
campaign.]{.underline}

#### Political science research proves\-\--voter preferences are [shaped early]{.underline}, but [aren't static]{.underline}.

William **Jennings 16**. PhD, Senior Lecturer in Politics and
International Relations at the University of Southampton; and
Christopher Wlezien, professor at University of Texas-Austin; American
Journal of Political Science, "The Timeline of Elections: A Comparative
Perspective", January 2016, p. 219-233

Discussion and **[Conclusion]{.underline}** [Voter preferences evolve in
a systematic way over the election timeline]{.underline} in a wide range
of representative democracies. There is structure to preferences well in
advance of elections, indeed, years before citizens actually vote. That
is, [[very **early polls** **predict the vote**]{.underline}]{.mark}, at
least [to some extent]{.underline}. This largely reflects differences in
the equilibrium support of parties and candidates. [Polls do become
increasingly informative over time]{.underline}, however, [pointing to
real evolution of preferences]{.underline}. That this pattern holds
across countries is important and points towards 35 a general tendency
in the formation of electoral preferences. But the pattern is not
precisely the same in all countries. Political institutions structure
the evolution of voters' preferences.23 Government institutions are
important. Preferences come into focus later in presidential elections
than in parliamentary ones. A year out from Election Day, parliamentary
elections are more predictable from the polls than are the outcomes of
presidential races. This presumably reflects the greater uncertainties
involved in the assessment of presidential candidates and also the time
it takes for voters to directly factor in their dispositions toward the
political parties (Erikson and Wlezien 2012). In parliamentary systems,
by contrast, parties matter more early on. This is important because
partisan dispositions, while not fixed, are more durable than those
toward candidates. That preferences are in place much later in
presidential systems thus comes as little surprise. That there is no
real difference between legislative elections in presidential and
parliamentary systems may surprise, however. It implies that parties do
not matter consistently more to voters in the latter. Electoral
institutions also are important. Preferences in legislative elections
come into focus more quickly and completely in proportional systems. We
find limited evidence of general differences across systems---that
proportional representation per se is what matters. We find stronger
evidence that the party-centricity of the systems matters most of all.
Although closely related to proportionality, there is significant
variation in party-centricity within both proportional and plurality
systems, and this variation is of consequence for the formation of
electoral preferences. The number of parties, meanwhile, appears to have
little effect. We have only scratched the surface of the variation in
context. To begin with, political institutions differ in ways that we
have not considered. Perhaps more importantly, there are other
differences in context that we have not even begun to explore. Some of
the differences relate to countries themselves. For instance, following
Converse (1969), there is reason to think that the age of democracy is
important to the formation and evolution of preferences. Other
differences relate not to political institutions or the countries
themselves, but to characteristics of political parties. There are
numerous possibilities here, most notable of which may be whether
parties are in government or opposition, as is suggested by the
literature on economic voting (e.g. Fiorina 1981; Duch and Stevenson
2008). Another is whether parties are catch-all or niche. The age and
size of parties also could matter. Clearly, much research remains to be
done, and our methodology can guide the way. That said, we have learned
something about the general pattern relating preferences and the vote
over the election timeline and the structuring influences of political
institutions. We have shown that [[preferences are often in place **far
in advance** of Election Day and]{.mark} that they [evolve
**slowly**]{.mark}]{.underline} [over time]{.underline}. Indeed,
[[the]{.mark} final [outcome is fairly clear]{.mark} in the polls
[before the]{.mark} election [campaign really begins]{.mark}. This is
[not to say that the campaign]{.mark} [does not
matter]{.mark},]{.underline} as [it d]{.underline}oes, particularly in
37 certain types of countries and elections where candidates are
central. [Even there]{.underline}, however, [it is clear that [the "long
campaign" **between elections** matters **most**]{.mark} of
all]{.underline}.

**[[The race starts early]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[With]{.mark} such [a
sprawling field]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[many candidates **are expected
to jump in earl**]{.mark}**y**]{.underline}. Only one Democrat, little
known U.S. Representative John Delaney of Maryland, has formally
announced a bid so far. **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[who filed

fight**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [He has taken to]{.underline} belittling
potential Democratic rivals during his [[frequent political
rallies]{.mark} to support Republican candidates,]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} [has been building **his**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[supporter lists]{.mark}** for nearly **two years.** [He]{.mark}
already has a campaign slogan,]{.underline} "Keep America Great" -
following "Make America Great Again" in 2016 - [and [has raised \$106
million for re-election]{.mark}, financial reports show. He is unlikely
to face a serious Republican primary challenge]{.underline}, and any
longshot bid would be a largely symbolic one from the party's narrow
anti-Trump wing, led by Ohio Governor John Kasich, who lost to Trump in
2016, and Arizona Senator Jeff Flake. Both are frequent Trump critics
who are leaving office. "I would seriously doubt" there will be a
challenge to Trump, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said,
adding Republicans feel good about their political standing. "From a
right of center point of view, it doesn't get any better than this
Congress. And I think the president has many things to feel good about,"
McConnell said. Democrats have no illusions about the race. Trump has
repeatedly shown his ability to dominate opponents and turn
controversies into rallying cries for his base. The 2020 campaign will
be Trump's first time on a ballot since his shocking 2016 upset of
Clinton, when he used his fame as a businessman and former reality TV
star with no experience in elected office to cast himself as the change
candidate who would smash the status quo. This time, Democrats say they
must be the agents of change. "If we are in a race where voters are
deciding between Trump and someone who is defending the Obama years,
we'll be in trouble," Tanden said.

### A2: Russia Hack

#### No impact---states are switching to paper

**Weise 9/19** (September 19th, 2017, Elizabeth Weise covers computer
security, technology and Silicon Valley out of USA TODAY\'s San
Francisco bureau. "Paper ballots are back in vogue thanks to Russian
hacking fears," USA Today.

AVD

According to the FBI, as many as 39 states had their election systems
scanned or targeted by Russia. [[There\'s no ev]{.mark}idence [of votes
changed]{.mark}]{.underline}. But given the stakes, some state agencies
that run elections are trying to curb any further interference prior to
mid-term elections in November. [Their tool of choice: Ensuring systems
can\'t be hacked, and if they are, making those breaches immediately
obvious]{.underline}. To do this, [some are taking the unusual move of
rewinding the technological dial, debating measures that would [add
paper ballots]{.mark}]{.underline} --- similar to how many Americans
voted before electronic voting started to become widespread in the
1980s. A week ago [Virginia announced it would no longer use
touch-screen-only voting machines]{.underline} after a hack-a-thon in
Las Vegas showed how easily they could be breached. [States with
electronic-only voting machines want to [add a paper back-up
that]{.mark} would [mandate]{.mark}, for every electronic ballot cast,
creation of [a paper version that could be counted, and]{.mark}
presumably, [not]{.mark} easily [altered]{.mark}. Rhode Island is set to
vote on a measure Tuesday that would require an audit of voters\' paper
ballots after each election. Georgia is fighting a suit by voters
that]{.underline}, among other claims, [alleges the state needs to
switch to a paper-ballots-based voting system]{.underline} because it
now uses touch-screen voting machines that do not meet the requirements
of state law due to their age and vulnerability to hacking. The U.S.
voting machine industry is dominated by three privately-held companies,
Election Systems & Software in Omaha, Neb., Dominion Voting Systems in
Toronto and HartInterCivic in Austin, Texas. A wholesale refitting of
the nation\'s voting machine infrastructure would represent a sizable
sales opportunity for them. But there\'s little money in the system to
make that happen, say experts. Too often voting officials lack the
resources necessary to protect and upgrade election infrastructures,
said Lawrence Norden, at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York
University School of Law and author of a report in June called Securing
Elections from Foreign Interference. "The federal government says it's
up to the states to fund it, the states often put it down to the
counties and the counties say they have no money. So we need some shared
responsibility for funding elections and making sure they're free and
fair,\" he said. Even so, [some states are moving to overhaul their
voting apparatus to be more secure]{.underline}. Last week, [Virginia's
Board of Elections voted to replace touch-screen-only voting machines
used in 22 localities in the state to those that have paper
back-ups.]{.underline} They did this after hackers at DefCon, a computer
security conference, demonstrated in July that they could easily break
into them. Touch-screen voting machines are considered insecure because
they don't produce a paper copy of the vote and therefore can't be
rigorously audited. Voting integrity activists aren\'t advocating
returning to a totally paper-based voting system, but instead requiring
that voting machines produce a paper record that can be used to check
the reported electronic totals. "[The step we took]{.underline} today to
decertify paperless voting systems [is necessary [to ensure the
integrity of]{.mark} Virginia's [elections]{.mark}]{.underline},"
said James Alcorn, chair of the State Board of Elections, in a
statement.

#### Election hacking is not a threat- Reforms have been made since 2016 and the threat is way overhyped

Brennan **Weiss** 6-17-20**18**. (\"US intelligence officials say Russia
will be back to try to undermine the 2018 elections. But here\'s why
Americans shouldn\'t be so worried..\" Business Insider. Web. 6-17-2018.

\>. MJD)

On June 23, 2016, unidentified hackers made their way into the statewide
voter-registration system in Illinois. They remained undetected in the
system for three weeks until they appeared to intentionally overload the
voter-registration website with a massive amount of traffic. It was only
then that IT staff at the Illinois State Board of Elections (SBE)
noticed that something was wrong. On July 13, state technicians took the
website offline to investigate the attack. For about a week, people in
Illinois weren\'t able to register online to vote, although they could
still do so by contacting their local election officials directly. The
IT experts doggedly scoured their online system for any trace of who
might have been behind the breach. They changed the system\'s code to
eliminate the technical vulnerabilities that opened the door to the
hackers in the first place. Having kicked out the hackers from their
election system, Illinois officials were back in control. But the
attacks on the voter-registration website continued unabated. Monitoring
of hacker activity revealed that IP addresses linked to the SBE were
being targeted five times per second, 24 hours a day. Then, on August
12, seven weeks after the initial breach, the attacks abruptly stopped.
The Illinois SBE was no longer under assault. Illinois SBE officials
didn\'t learn who was behind the attack until about a year later, when
officials from the Department of Homeland Security
[testified](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4674853/russian-interference-us-elections-federal-intelligence-cybersecurity-officials-state-government)before
the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia was behind the targeting
of election systems in 21 states, including Illinois. That hackers
linked to the Kremlin were responsible for the breach didn\'t come as a
surprise. Matt Dietrich, an SBE spokesman, told Business Insider that
the Board assumed Russia was the culprit because Moscow had also been
implicated in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, which
occurred around the same time in June and July 2016. \"But that was more
or less immaterial to us,\" Dietrich recalled. \"Our concern was just
that it happened. How do we not let it happen again?\" **[[After the
attack, the SBE strengthened its relationship with DHS, implementing
weekly cyber-hygiene tests]{.mark} in October 2016 [to scan for
vulnerabilities]{.mark} in the state\'s election
infrastructure.]{.underline}** [Those weekly tests still take place
today along with continuous monitoring of network activity on state
computers, as well as regular cybersecurity awareness training for state
employees provided by the Illinois Department of Innovation and
Technology[.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Illinois is one of 32 states that
have requested and received ongoing cyber hygiene scans]{.mark},
according to an official from the National Protection and Programs
Directorate at DHS]{.underline}**. **[The state is also scheduled to
undergo a full-scale risk and vulnerability assessment from DHS to make
sure the state\'s election systems are prepared for the 2018
midterms]{.underline}**. \"[It was just human error and some programming
that allowed our breach to happen,\" Dietrich said. \"But we fixed that,
and now we think that we\'ve enhanced our system to guard against
something like that from ever happening again]{.underline}. But you just
don\'t know.\" After the US intelligence community\'s
[assessment](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) found
that the Russian government tried to interfere in the 2016 US
presidential election --- representing \"Moscow\'s longstanding desire
to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order\" --- panic set in
around the country. Election officials complained they lacked the
resources to adequately address cyber threats. Lawmakers warned of an
[impending
breakdown](https://www.businessinsider.com/marco-rubio-describes-how-a-foreign-power-could-undermine-us-election-2018-3)
in American democracy. And President Donald Trump hardly made things
better by
[wavering](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/02/words-trump-russian-meddling/),
on more than one occasion, when asked whether he believed claims of
Russian interference. Americans also started questioning their own
election-day votes. When DHS
[announced](https://www.businessinsider.com/r-wisconsin-20-other-us-states-targeted-by-russian-hackers-in-2016-election-2017-9)
in September 2017 that it had contacted officials in 21 states targeted
by Russian government hackers, many voters misinterpreted that
assessment to mean that the Russians had changed actual votes. That
never happened, as Brent Davis, the director of operations at the
Illinois SBE,
[explained](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/highland-park/news/ct-hpn-election-integrity-forum-tl-1102-20171031-story.html)
last year during a panel discussion about his state\'s 2016
voter-registration breach. \"I\'m not trying to say it\'s not a big deal
because it is a big deal for a lot of reasons,\" Davis said. \"But it is
completely unrelated to voting on election day or voting early or by
mail or the tabulation of those ballots.\" [[Election officials have
described Russia\'s cyberattacks]{.mark} against state voting databases
[as a \"rattling of doorknobs]{.mark}.\" \"It\'s really reconnaissance
by a bad guy to try and figure out how they could break into your
computer,\"]{.underline} Trevor Timmons, a spokesman for the Colorado
secretary of state\'s office, [told The Associated
Press](https://apnews.com/cb8a753a9b0948589cc372a3c037a567) last year
after Colorado was informed it was one of the states targeted by the
Russians. \"**[[It\'s not an attack. I wouldn\'t call it a probe. It\'s
not a breach. It\'s not a penetration.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** In
fact[, the Illinois breach appears to have been Russia\'s only
successful attack against a state\'s election system in
2016]{.underline}. DHS officials [previously
confirmed](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/06/21/written-testimony-ia-cyber-division-acting-director-dr-samuel-liles-and-nppd-acting)
in testimony to Congress that \"a small number of networks were
successfully compromised.\" But when Business Insider followed up on the
admission, DHS officials would not provide details about any other
potential successful breaches. Nevertheless, US officials have said
repeatedly that Russia\'s interference affected no votes during the 2016
election, despite the [Senate Intelligence Committee\'s
finding](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-hackers-had-access-to-delete-or-alter-voter-data-before-2016-election-2018-5)
that Russia-linked hackers had access to \"alter or delete voter
registration data\" in a small number of states before the election. But
[[state and local election officials aren\'t]{.mark} necessarily
[worried about foreign hackers changing votes. In many cases, hackers
don\'t even have the capabilities to probe actual voting machines on
election day, and the highly decentralized nature of the US election
system]{.mark} --- where counties and states are the ones running
elections --- would make it difficult for hackers to alter votes on a
massive scale.]{.underline} \"**[[Our systems are better defended than
other places are, and it gives us strength]{.mark},\"]{.underline}**
said Bob Kolasky, the deputy assistant secretary for Infrastructure
Protection at DHS. \"[[It\'s extremely difficult to have a massive
impact on the voting process without that being observed.]{.mark} And we
do feel like with voting machines, there is perhaps a lower
vulnerability.\"]{.underline} The fear, therefore, lies in a bad
actor\'s ability to undermine faith in the legitimacy of the election
process itself. Election officials say this can be done by the mere
appearance that election systems are vulnerable to hackers. Russia, or
anyone else seeking to sow discord, doesn\'t actually have to change any
votes to upend an election. Planting that seed of doubt was part of
Russia\'s goal, US intelligence officials have concluded --- hacking was
just one part of their campaign to scare Americans into thinking their
elections could be compromised. Using social media to spread partisan
bias and fake news were part of their tactics, too. \"I don\'t believe
hackers can get to the heart of the matter --- to the votes,\" said Noah
Praetz, the director of elections in Cook County, Illinois, the US\'s
third-most-populous county. \"But they can sow enough distrust\" that
people could lose faith in the democratic process. David Becker, the
founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told
Business Insider he thinks this is what Russia was trying to do in
Illinois. \"If you look at how the Illinois data breach occurred, the
hackers very slowly accessed a very small number of records for a couple
weeks and they weren\'t noticed,\" Becker said. \"Then all of a sudden
they started accessing a massive amount of records and that was noticed
since it sucked up all the bandwidth.\" \"If the hackers were sitting
inside a system and not being noticed, why would you do something to get
noticed?\" he added. \"The answer\'s obvious: Because you want to get
noticed. You want Americans to doubt their own functioning democracy.
That\'s the goal of the Russians and others who are seeking to
interfere. And we have to be careful not to help them.\" \'After 2020,
we still have to be vigilant\' In rare bipartisan fashion, Congress
approved [\$380
million](https://www.eac.gov/2018-hava-election-security-funds/) in
election-security funding in March, the largest distribution of such
funds since the passing of the Help America Vote Act in 2002, which
provided \$4 billion to the Election Assistance Commission to divvy up
among states. The funding will help states replace [outdated voting
machines](https://www.businessinsider.com/old-voting-machines-threaten-election-security-2018-3),
implement postelection audits, and provide election officials with
cybersecurity-awareness training, among other improvements in election
security. \"In this challenging political time, this has to be seen as a
win and a recognition that \[election security\] is an important
responsibility,\" Adam Ambrogi, the director of the Elections Program at
the Democracy Fund, [previously
told](https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-included-election-security-in-spending-bill-2018-3)
Business Insider. But Congress has yet to pass any singular legislation
in response to Russia\'s 2016 election meddling[. This has created the
false perception that nothing has been done to shore up weaknesses in
state election infrastructures and that state officials are balking at
the notion that election security is an urgent matter, Becker told
Business Insider. \"**That is absolutely not the case**,\" he said. \"It
can be both true that the threat is real and we have to be extremely
vigilant and that the actors charged with that vigilance are acting
responsibly.]{.underline} And I think both of those things are true.\"
[There is a lot of evidence supporting Becker\'s claim.]{.underline}
Before Virginia\'s gubernatorial election last November, election
officials there
[ordered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/paper-ballots-make-a-comeback-in-virginia-this-fall/2017/10/07/724106ec-a92b-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html?utm_term=.e4394a60ba4c)
all towns, cities, and counties to use paper ballots. In February,
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said all new voting machines purchased in the
state must include a paper trail. And in the Georgia House, lawmakers
were considering a bill that would replace electronic touchscreen voting
with a paper-based system. [After the 2017 elections in Colorado, state
officials conducted a first-in-the-nation election audit --- or what\'s
sometimes called a \"risk-limiting audit\" --- to verify the results,
which they plan to use for future elections]{.underline}. Rhode Island,
Virginia, Iowa, Washington, and Mississippi have also passed legislation
requiring some variation of risk-limiting audits or an enhanced
recording of votes, according to data collected by the [National
Conference of State
Legislatures](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/2017-election-legislation-enacted-by-state-legislatures.aspx).
Other states, including Nevada, Minnesota, and Utah, have appropriated
funds for updating voting equipment. Federal officials have made some
gains as well. In January 2017, then DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson
[announced](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/06/statement-secretary-johnson-designation-election-infrastructure-critical)
that election infrastructure would be considered \"critical,\" a
seemingly inconsequential but significant move that enables the federal
government to devote resources more easily to protect US elections. It
also allows more streamlined communication between state officials and
Washington. The relationship between DHS and state election officials
has \"improved tremendously,\" said Connie Lawson, the president of the
National Association of Secretaries of State and Indiana\'s top election
official. \"As long as DHS says they\'re here to provide services and
their mission is not to take over elections at all, then I think states
will learn to trust them even more,\" Lawson said, referring to concerns
some state election officials have about the federal government getting
too involved in how states run elections. [At least 15 states have also
requested a risk and vulnerability assessment from DHS, and eight of
them have been completed so far.]{.underline} One DHS official told
Business Insider the remaining assessments were scheduled and would take
place before the midterm elections in November. The DHS official
described the risk and vulnerability assessment as the department\'s
\"most extensive\" election security related service. The assessment
involves an on-site evaluation of a state\'s election infrastructure by
three to five DHS officials who make up what\'s called a Hunt and
Incident Response Team. The team typically spends a couple weeks
conducting the assessment, testing technical controls and offering
customized advice to election officials on how to improve their systems.
But while a risk and vulnerability assessment could help states
safeguard their election systems, it won\'t guarantee foolproof election
security. \"As states and counties get better and have more secure
systems, the bad guys are going to get better as well,\" Becker said.
\"We need state legislatures and Congress to think of elections as more
of a 365, seven-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day thing.\" \"[We\'re not going
to cross a finish line and say, \'We\'re secure,\'\" he added. \"Even
after 2020, we\'re still going to have to be vigilant.\"]{.underline}

Daniel **Malloy 18**, writer for OZY, 11/11/18, "DONALD DOSSIER: HOW
TRUMP CAN WIN BY LOSING,"
https://www.ozy.com/opinion/donald-dossier-how-trump-can-win-by-losing/90568

In 1987's The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump, by way of ghostwriter Tony
Schwartz, had this to say about his pugilistic nature. "\[W\]hen people
treat me badly or unfairly or try to take advantage of me, my general
attitude, all my life, has been to fight back very hard. The risk is
you'll make a bad situation worse, and I certainly don't recommend this
approach to everyone. But my experience is that if you're fighting for
something you believe in --- even if it means alienating some people
along the way --- things usually work out for the best in the end."¶ Or,
as he put it on Wednesday when asked in a rollicking news conference if
he would be able to work on bipartisan initiatives with Democrats if
they pursue investigations into his administration: "If they do that,
then it's just --- all it is, is a warlike posture."¶ [[A]{.mark}
critical [turning point]{.mark} in the Trump presidency [just
arrived]{.mark}]{.underline}, and if he thought the Swamp was against
him before, just wait until January. After taking over the House in
Tuesday's midterm elections, [[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} all of a
sudden [have **leverage on legislation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[big and
small]{.mark}.]{.underline} Perhaps more importantly, they have the
power to subpoena documents and witnesses from the administration, as
well as drive news coverage with high-profile hearings. Does Trump or
his new interim attorney general want to fire Special Counsel Robert
Mueller? Fine, the House Judiciary Committee will simply invite Mueller
over to share his findings with every TV camera within a 30-mile
radius.¶ [And [yet,]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[this]{.mark} new dynamic
[suits Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}**.¶ [The Republican Congress has been
mostly compliant]{.underline}, passing tax cuts while the House
Intelligence Committee runs interference on the Mueller probe. [But it's
created awkwardness when Trump doesn't get his way,]{.underline} for
example, on funding a wall at the border or the repeal of Obamacare.
[He's comfortable taking shots at Paul Ryan, Bob Corker or the late John
McCain, but the optics aren't great]{.underline}. Remember the seminal
moment of this year was when the entire GOP and conservative universe
aligned with Brett Kavanaugh against Democrats and his accusers and
installed him on the Supreme Court? Plan to see that dynamic play out
again and again.¶ [For the next two years, the Washington [storylines
will not be driven by Republican infighting, but by a]{.mark} clearly
defined]{.underline} **[[Dem]{.mark}ocrat [versus Republican
battle]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [It]{.underline}]{.mark} [all [improves
Trump's chances for re-election]{.mark} in 2020]{.underline}. **[[He's
better with a foil]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and instead of ejecting
reporters]{.underline} from the White House grounds, [[he can
focus]{.mark} better [on Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Though the mutually beneficial CNN fights will surely continue.)¶ Sure,
Trump still has the capacity to surprise. He could swing left on a deal
to spend \$1 trillion on new roads and bridges or crack down more on the
pharmaceutical industry. He's expressed a fondness in the past for
dealmaking with his pals "Chuck and Nancy," who seem to understand his
transactional nature.¶ But don't bet on it.¶ [The [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s
will start with **carefully choreographed hearings** and
investigations]{.mark} of only the most egregious-seeming
scandals]{.underline} --- they've already requested records related to
Attorney General Jeff Sessions' ejection last week and the installation
of Mueller critic Matt Whitaker over the special counsel probe.
Speaker-in-waiting Nancy [[Pelosi has done her best to tamp down
expectations of impeachment]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the pressure will
only grow as 2019 gets underway. A Wall Street Journal report on Friday
laying out federal prosecutors' evidence of Trump likely breaking
campaign finance law to pay off mistresses in 2016 will be more than
enough for many Democrats to shout "high crimes and misdemeanors."¶ [The
political argument against impeachment for sex-related offenses is
obvious to anyone who lived through the late 1990s, and]{.underline}
**[[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [leaders will be cautious about
overreach]{.mark}]{.underline}**.¶ Not that it will matter much to
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, who, as always, [[will be keen to

#### 2. Votes of key swing demographics -- they support arms sales and their benefit to the US.

Andrew **Exum** former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Middle
East Policy (US Department of Defense), PhD in War Studies (King's
College London) **2017** "What Progressives Miss About Arms Sales," *The
Atlantic,*
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/americas-right-to-sell-arms/527805/

I want to spend a little time talking about one of the reasons why the
trip went so well. I'll warn you: This is a somewhat taboo subject for
progressive foreign-policy types. The subject, friends, is arms sales.
[[Progressives don't like arms sales very much, but they need to pay
attention to them]{.underline}]{.mark}, because [[they're one big way
Republicans are fighting for---and winning---the votes of working-class
Americans who have traditionally voted for
Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the president was in Saudi Arabia,
the Trump administration announced \$110 billion in arms sales to Saudi
Arabia---with an additional \$240 billion committed over a 10-year
period. If you've ever worked in government, you know this is what is
called a "deliverable," the clunky management-consultantese term for a
tangible outcome of a visit or meeting. When Donald Trump is asked to
justify his trip to Saudi Arabia, he'll cite that \$110 billion in arms
sales. There are a few interesting things about these sales. The first
is that many of these sales were already in the works. The Obama
administration spent eight years quietly selling a lot of arms to Saudi
Arabia: When President Obama left office, for example, the United States
still had \$100 billion in the foreign military sales pipeline with
Saudi Arabia and, in 2011, had inked what was previously the largest
arms sale in U.S. history with the Kingdom---a \$29 billion deal to sell
F-15s to the Saudis. Obama-era sales to Saudi Arabia were in keeping
with sales to other Gulf states: Both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
bought a tremendous amount of U.S. arms between 2009 and 2017. Qatar
bought more U.S. arms than any other state in 2014 and, in the waning
days of the Obama administration, announced that it would buy nearly \$4
billion in Boeing-made F-15s in addition to \$19 billion in commercial
aircraft, also from Boeing. Overall, the Arab Gulf states went on a
spending spree during the Obama years, and most of the money was spent
on American arms. So why didn't you hear a lot about this from
Democratic politicians during the 2016 election season? There are two
main reasons---one strategic and one moral. Strategically, not everyone
is convinced that arming the Arab Gulf states to the teeth is a wise
idea. Some worry that these arms might someday endanger Israel's
security, while others worry the Arab Gulf states might be encouraged to
use their new toys on disastrous military interventions against Iran or
Iranian proxies in, say, Yemen. The quick and unsatisfying answer to
these concerns is the global market. The Arab Gulf states have money,
and that money will buy the weapons that are available. If U.S. arms are
not for sale, fine: French, Chinese, or Russian arms will be. (And if
you don't believe me, look at the way in which Gulf states---frustrated
by U.S. export controls on drone technology---are turning to the
Chinese.) Selling U.S. arms to the Gulf states, by contrast, further
ties them to U.S. interests by deepening cooperation and
interoperability between the U.S. military and its Gulf partners. One of
the reasons Qatar wanted to buy U.S. fighters to partially replace its
French-made fleet, for example, was because they discovered how
difficult it was for their existing fighter aircraft to fly with the
U.S. air force as part of coalitions over Libya and Syria. [[Arms sales
also drive down the cost of our own weapons and thus the amount of money
U.S. tax-payers have to spend on defense instead of other
priorities]{.underline}]{.mark} like, say, the State Department, school
lunches, or housing subsidies. Here's one example: Because the United
States is buying fewer F-35s than originally planned and using more of
its "fourth generation" fighters (F-15s, F-16s, etc.) in the skies over
Iraq and Syria than previously anticipated, the Department of Defense
will likely need to buy more of those fourth generation fighters in the
coming years. The recent sales of F-15s to Qatar, F-18s to Kuwait, and
F-16s to Bahrain will drive down the cost per plane for the Pentagon.
That's a good thing---at least financially. Morally, though, many
progressives just grow ill at the idea of selling weapons abroad.
Senator Chris Murphy, for example---one of the more eloquent and
consistent critics of U.S. arms sales in the Senate, even though his own
state has a very robust defense industrial base---sees nothing admirable
about the idea of selling weapons to the Saudis that might be used in
Yemen. Other progressives agree: Yes, they argue, we understand the
demand of the market will be met by someone, but do we have to be
complicit in providing the supply? In other countries, progressives have
even taken to the courts in an effort to halt sales. I have a lot of
respect for these progressives and their values. I spent too much time
in Sunday School as a kid to not feel a little uneasy about the business
of selling weapons. And the angst many progressives feel about U.S. arms
sales has been enough to keep many Democrats from talking up their
successes in helping U.S. industry abroad. I wonder, though, if there
isn't a real political cost to not doing so. [[Boeing employs 157,000
people---almost all of them in the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}.
14,500 people work in Boeing's facilities in Missouri, where the F-15
and F-18 are made, where Senator Claire McCaskill is up for reelection
next year, and where Donald Trump trounced Hillary Clinton 56 to 38
percent in 2016. (Those 14,500 people do not include the many thousands
of other Americans who make parts for the F-15 and F-18 elsewhere in
America.) Lockheed Martin, meanwhile, a huge winner in the recent arms
deal with Saudi Arabia (despite ace businessman Jared Kushner
negotiating the price down on behalf of the Saudis), employs an
additional 97,000 workers---again, most of them in the United States.
And Raytheon, another big winner last week, employs another 60,000 or so
Americans. Donald Trump obviously has no moral qualms about selling
weapons to our partners and allies abroad. And so [[while Democrats
leave points on the board with working-class voters by not talking about
how much Democrats do to support U.S. industry, Republicans swoop in to
take credit with assembly line workers]{.underline}]{.mark} for even
those things that Obama approved and set in motion. [[The way in which
Trump brags about U.S. arms sales, of course, is in keeping with the
strain of economic mercantilism that ran through his populist campaign
message]{.underline}]{.mark}. That message worked with voters throughout
the Midwest, helping to cost Clinton the election. So while progressives
might have moral qualms about companies that sell weapons, [[the roughly
1.2 million American voters who work in the aerospace and defense
sector---together with the roughly 3.2 million Americans who support the
sector indirectly---see little wrong with the sales]{.underline}]{.mark}
that help ensure their livelihoods and provide a future for their
children. This might be another area in which progressive elites---who
have the kinds of education and skills that don't require them to seek
work on the assembly line---are simply out of touch with the voters they
need to win back control of the Congress and state assemblies, never
mind the presidency. And politics aside, surely even the moral calculus
of arms sales gets more complicated when you think about the millions of
American mouths that are fed by mothers and fathers who work in the
aerospace and defense sector. [[Donald Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
his part, [[is speaking to those voters]{.underline}]{.mark}. And even
as progressives fret about U.S. arms sales, they should also fret about
what it will mean for the rest of their agenda when Republicans claim
credit for protecting some of the last good assembly-line jobs in
America.

With the House speaker's gavel now in hand, Nancy [[Pelosi has]{.mark} a
chance [to sketch]{.mark}]{.underline} out [a vision of [how Democrats
would govern if voters award them]{.mark}]{.underline} control of
Congress and [the White House [in 2020]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Addressing the House chamber on Thursday, [[Pelosi ticked off an agenda
that was]{.underline}]{.mark} **[a [ready-made]{.mark} campaign
platform]{.underline}**: mitigating [income inequality]{.underline},
tackling the "existential threat" of [climate change]{.underline},
protecting young undocumented [immigrants, gun control and cracking down
on lobbying]{.underline} in Washington. [**[Not mentioned]{.underline}**
[was]{.underline}]{.mark} the biggest single motivator for many of the
voters who returned Democrats to control of the House: [Taking on
President Donald [Trump]{.mark}. "These two years --- **[we've got to
get]{.mark} some [stuff done]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
**[[this is an audition]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Connecticut Democrat
Jim [Himes said]{.underline} Thursday. "So [[we need

**[but]{.underline}**]{.mark} [we also need to show]{.underline} that
**[we can [accomplish things]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to
address]{.underline} the [concerns]{.underline} that people have
**[[around the kitchen table."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Pelosi will have
to steer her agenda through a diverse and restive group of Democratic
lawmakers that includes including younger members and progressives such
as New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who are unwilling to defer to
tradition and seniority. It also includes Democrats in more conservative
districts who refused to back Pelosi for speaker. Cutting Deals [[The

erratic and also so self-centered," [said]{.underline} Representative
Judy [Chu]{.underline} of California. "How do you deal with that? How do
you deal with the Senate, which is still controlled by Republicans?\"
[The tricky calculation will be]{.underline} knowing [when to team
up]{.underline} with Trump [and when to confront him]{.underline}.
\"[**[The biggest challenge]{.underline}** [is doing two things at once.

credit]{.underline}** with him potentially on certain major
accomplishments,\" [said]{.underline} Representative Raja

[[The overall progressive policy on this question means campaigning for

(AUMF). In general, [[privileging diplomatic over war strategies starts
with withdrawing troops and halting the arms sales that flood the region
with deadly weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. Those weapons too often end up
in the hands of killers on all sides, from bands of unaccountable
militants to brutally repressive governments, with civilians paying the
price. [[Congress members should demand an end of massive arms
sales]{.underline}]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other U.S.
allies carrying out brutal wars across the Middle East, and they should
call for an end to the practice of arming non-state proxies who kill
even more people. They should call for a U.S. arms embargo on Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan,
Jordan and Israel (which presents a whole other set of arms-related
challenges), while urging Russia to stop its arms sales to Syria, Iran
and Pakistan. [[Given the power of the arms industries in the United

winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_winter), [[it ought to take
precedence over all other risk concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} --- at
least [[in the near-term]{.underline}]{.mark}. Let's make sure we get
our priorities straight.

#### Irreversibility is the metric for weighing impacts

**Sunstein 2007** Cass R.---Professor in the Department of Political
Science and at the Law School of the University of Chicago ("Worst-Case
Scenarios", Harvard University Press)

Most worst-case scenarios appear to have an element of irreversibility.
Once a species is lost, it is lost forever. The special concern for
endangered species stems from the permanence of their loss (outside of
Jurassic Park). One of the most serious fears associated with
genetically modified organisms is that they might lead to irreversible
ecological harm. Because some **[greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere
for centuries, the problem of [climate change may be
irreversible,]{.mark} at least for all practical
purposes]{.underline}**. Transgenic crops can impose irreversible losses
too, because they can make pests more resistant to pesticides. If we
invest significant wealth in one source of energy and neglect others, we
may be effectively stuck forever, or at least for a long time. One
objection to capital punishment is that errors cannot be reversed. In
ordinary life, **[our [judgments ]{.mark}]{.underline}**about worst-case
scenarios **[[have everything to do with
irreversibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course an action may be hard
but not impossible to undo, and so there may be a continuum of cases,
with different degrees of difficulty in reversing. A marriage can be
reversed, but divorce is rarely easy; having a child is very close to
irreversible; moving from New York to Paris is reversible, but moving
back may be difficult. People often take steps to avoid courses of
action that are burdensome rather than literally impossible to reverse.
**[In this light, we might identify an Irreversible Harm Precautionary
Principle, applicable to a subset of risks]{.underline}**.\' As a rough
first approximation, the principle says this: [S**[pecial steps should
be taken to avoid irreversible harms]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, through
precautions that go well beyond those that would be taken if
irreversibility were not a problem.]{.underline}** The general attitude
here is \"act, then learn**[,\" as opposed to the tempting alternative
of \"wait and learn.\"]{.underline}** In the case of climate change,
some people believe that research should be our first line of defense.
In **[their view, we should refuse to commit substantial resources to
the problem until e]{.underline}**vidence of serious harm is
unmistakably clear.\' But even assuming that the evidence is not so
clear, research **[without action allows greenhouse gas [emissions
]{.mark}]{.underline}**to continue, which might [**[produce risks that
are irreversible]{.underline}**,]{.mark} or at best difficult and
expensive to reverse. For this reason, **[the best course of action
might well be to [take precautions]{.mark} now as a way of [preserving
flexibility]{.mark} [for future generations]{.mark}. In the
environmental context in general, this principle suggests that
regulators should proceed with far more aggressive measures than would
otherwise seem justified]{.underline}**.

#### Every bit of reduced emissions is good- lowers the damage and risk of extinction

**Nuccitelli '12** (9-1 Dana Nuccitelli is an environmental scientist at
a private environmental consulting firm in the Sacramento, California
area. This piece was originally published at Skeptical Science and was
reprinted with permission. "Realistically What Might The Future Climate
Look Like?" ThinkProgress
http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/09/01/784931/realistically-what-might-the-future-climate-look-like/

Clearly **[[our CO2 emissions have not yet
peaked]{.underline}]{.mark}**\-\--in fact they increased by 1 billion
tonnes between 2010 and 2011 despite a continued global economic
recession; therefore, the green curve is no longer an option. There has
also been little progress toward an international climate accord to
replace the Kyoto Protocol, which suggests that the blue curve does not
represent a likely scenario either\-\--in order to achieve peak
emissions in 2015 we would have to take serious steps to reduce
emissions today, which we are not. The red curve seems the most likely,
but the required cuts are so steep that it is unlikely we will be able
to achieve them, which means we are indeed likely to surpass the 2°C
target. Thus it is worth exploring the question, what would a world with
\>2°C global surface warming look like? Global Warming Impacts The 2007
IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) summarizes the magnitudes of impact
of various degrees of warming here, and graphically in Figure 2,
relative to \~1990 temperatures (\~0.6°C above late 19th Century
temperatures). Some adverse impacts are expected **[even before we reach
the]{.underline}** 2°C **[limit]{.underline}**, for example hundreds of
millions of people being subjected to **[increased water
stress]{.underline}**, increasing drought at mid-latitudes (as we
recently discussed here), increased **[coral bleaching]{.underline}**,
increased coastal damage from **[floods and storms,]{.underline}** and
increased morbidity and mortality from more **[frequent and intense heat
waves]{.underline}** (see here), floods, and droughts. However, by and
large these are impacts which we should be able to adapt to, at a cost,
but without disastrous consequences. **[[Once we surpass the 2°C target,
the impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}** listed above **[[are
exacerbated]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and some new impacts will occur.
Most corals will bleach, and widespread coral mortality is expected
\~3°C above late 19th Century temperatures. Up to **[30% of global
species will be at risk for extinction]{.underline}**, and the figure
could exceed 40% if we surpass 4°C, as we continue on **[the path toward
the Earth's sixth mass extinction.]{.underline}** Coastal flooding will
impact millions more people at \~2.5°C, and a number of adverse health
effects are expected to continue rising along with temperatures. Reasons
for Concern Smith et al. (2009) (on which the late great Stephen
Schneider was a co-author) updated the IPCC impact assessment, arriving
at similar conclusions. For example, "There is medium confidence that
\~20--30% of known plant and animal species are likely to be at
increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature
exceed 1.5 °C to 2.5 °C over 1980--1999″ "increases in drought, heat
waves, and floods are projected in many regions and would have adverse
impacts, including increased water stress, **[wildfire
frequency]{.underline}**, and flood risks (starting at less than 1 °C of
additional warming above 1990 levels) and adverse health effects
(slightly above 1 °C)" "climate change over the next century is likely
to adversely affect hundreds of millions of people through increased
coastal flooding after a further 2 °C warming from 1990 levels;
reductions in water supplies (0.4 to 1.7 billion people affected with
less than a 1 °C warming from 1990 levels); and **[increased health
impacts]{.underline}** (that are already being observed" Smith et al.
updated the 2001 IPCC report 'burning embers' diagram to reflect their
findings (Figure 3). On this figure, white regions indicate neutral or
low impacts or risks, yellow indicates negative impacts for some systems
or more significant risks, and red indicates substantial negative
impacts or risks that are more widespread and/or severe. They have
grouped the various climate change consequences into 'reasons for
concern' (RFCs), summarized below. Figure 3: Risks from climate change,
by reason for concern (RFC). Climate change consequences are plotted
against increases in global mean temperature (°C) after 1990. Each
column corresponds to a specific RFC and represents additional outcomes
associated with increasing global mean temperature. The color scheme
represents progressively increasing levels of risk and should not be
interpreted as representing ''dangerous anthropogenic interference,''
which is a value judgment. The historical period 1900 to 2000 warmed by
0.6 °C and led to some impacts. It should be noted that this figure
addresses only how risks change as global mean temperature increases,
not how risks might change at different rates of warming. Furthermore,
it does not address when impacts might be realized, nor does it account
for the effects of different development pathways on vulnerability. Risk
to Unique and Threatened Systems addresses **[the]{.underline}**
potential for increased **[damage to]{.underline}** or
**[irreversible]{.underline}** loss of **[unique and threatened
systems]{.underline}**, such as coral **[reefs]{.underline}**, tropical
glaciers, **[endangered species]{.underline}**, unique ecosystems,
**[biodiversity hotspots]{.underline}**, small island states, and
**[indigenous communities.]{.underline}** Risk of Extreme Weather Events
tracks increases in extreme events with substantial consequences for
societies and natural systems. Examples include increase in the
frequency, **[intensity]{.underline}**, or consequences
**[of]{.underline}** heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires, or
**[tropical cyclones]{.underline}**. Distribution of Impacts concerns
disparities of impacts. Some regions, countries, and populations face
greater harm from climate change, whereas other regions, countries, or
populations would be much less harmed---and some may benefit; the
magnitude of harm can also vary within regions and across sectors and
populations. Aggregate Damages covers comprehensive measures of impacts.
Impacts distributed across the globe can be aggregated into a single
metric, such as monetary damages, lives affected, or lives lost.
Aggregation techniques vary in their treatment of equity of outcomes, as
well as treatment of impacts that are not easily quantified. Risks of
Large-Scale Discontinuities represents the likelihood that certain
phenomena (sometimes called tipping points) would occur, any of which
may be accompanied by very large impacts. These phenomena include the
deglaciation (partial or complete) of the West Antarctic or Greenland
ice sheets and major changes in some components of the Earth's climate
system, such as a substantial reduction or collapse of the North
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. All of these reasons for
concern enter the red (substantial negative impact, high risk) region by
4°C. Aggregate impacts are in the red region by 3°C, and some types of
concerns are in the red region by 1°C. For more details we also
recommend Mark Lynas' book Six Degrees, which goes through the climate
impacts from each subsequent degree of warming, based on a very thorough
review of the scientific literature. A brief review of the book by Eric
Steig and summary of some key impacts is available here. National
Geographic also did a series of videos on the Six Degrees theme, which
no longer seem to be available on their websites, but which can still be
found on YouTube. This is Why Reducing Emissions is Critical We're not
yet committed to surpassing 2°C global warming, but as Watson noted,
**[[we are]{.mark} quickly [running out of time to]{.mark} realistically
[give ourselves a chance to stay below that 'danger
limit']{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, **[[2°]{.mark}C [is not a
do-or-die threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Every bit
of]{.underline}**]{.mark} CO2 **[[emissions we can reduce means that
much avoided future warming,]{.mark} which means that much avoided
climate change impacts[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As Lonnie Thompson
noted, **[[the more global warming we]{.mark} manage to [mitigate, the
less adaption and suffering we will be forced to cope with]{.mark} in
the future]{.underline}**. Realistically, based on the current political
climate (which we will explore in another post next week), limiting
global warming to 2°C is probably the best we can do. However, there is
a big difference between 2°C and 3°C, between 3°C and 4°C, and anything
greater than 4°C can probably accurately be described as catastrophic,
since various tipping points are expected to be triggered at this level.
Right now, we are on track for the catastrophic consequences (widespread
coral mortality, mass extinctions, hundreds of millions of people
adversely impacted by droughts, floods, heat waves, etc.). But we're not
stuck on that track just yet, and **[we need to move ourselves as far
off of it as possible by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions as soon
and as much as possible[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There are of course
many people who believe that the planet will not warm as much, or that
the impacts of the associated climate change will be as bad as the body
of scientific evidence suggests. That is certainly a possiblity, and we
very much hope that their optimistic view is correct. However, what we
have presented here is the best summary of scientific evidence
available, and it paints a very bleak picture if we fail to rapidly
reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. If we continue forward on our
current path, **[catastrophe]{.underline}** is not just a possible
outcome, it **[is the most probable outcome]{.underline}**. And an
intelligent risk management approach would involve taking steps to
prevent a catastrophic scenario if it were a mere possibility, let alone
the most probable outcome. This is especially true since the most
important component of the solution\-\--carbon pricing\-\--can be
implemented at a relatively low cost, and a far lower cost than trying
to adapt to the climate change consequences we have discussed here
(Figure 4).

### 2NC Paris solves warming

The historic [[[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark}
Agreement](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/what-is-the-paris-agreement-on-climate-change/)
on climate change has [[added wind to the sails of already accelerating
climate-smart investment markets]{.underline}]{.mark}. The year 2015 was
another record-breaking one for renewable energy with nearly \$350
billion invested, more than doubling the amount going to coal and
gas-fired power generation. So, where are the most promising investments
and what do the governments need to do to unlock private finance? To
answer these questions, IFC---a member of the World Bank Group and the
largest global development institution focused on the private sector in
developing countries---analyzed the national climate commitments made in
Paris by [[21 emerging market economies where we expect to see major
investment in infrastructure and climate-smart solutions. If these
countries make good on their ambitions to scale up]{.underline}]{.mark}

that will be Central America's biggest. [[As governments move to
implement their renewable energy targets post-Paris, we can expect more
Penonome-type investments]{.underline}]{.mark}. Wind turbines are
pictured at a wind farm in Penonome, Cocle province, Panama, November
10, 2015. Image: REUTERS/Carlos Jasso Energy efficiency investments are
also a growing opportunity, with 110 countries targeting investments in
cogeneration, efficient appliances, and green buildings in their Paris
commitments. One example of an energy efficiency investment that we can
expect to see more of is IFC's China Utility Energy Efficiency
programme, which provided Chinese banks with a risk-sharing facility and
advisory services to help them implement energy efficiency investments.
The programme, supported by the Global Environment Facility, started in
2006 with two Chinese banks and has grown to drive 11 billion Chinese
yuan (\$2 billion) in finance through local banks, including in the
country's poorest regions. These investments have helped prevent more
than 22 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. And as China urbanizes
further, we estimate \$2.1 trillion in new green buildings investments
by 2020. Many similar investments in other countries are also possible.
The outlook for investments in climate solutions by the private sector
is strong. Still, unlocking this potential and in some cases creating
new markets also requires sustained action by governments to put in
place the right set of policies and measures. We see three key
priorities for countries seeking to attract private investments in the
climate space: First, turn [[climate targets into long-term clean growth
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} with supportive policies and budgets.
This means integrating commitments into national development strategies
and establishing clear and consistent policies such as carbon pricing.
Governments should integrate climate considerations into key sector
policies such as energy and agriculture by removing inefficient
production or consumption subsidies and aligning tax and fiscal
policies. [[Countries can use innovative support
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark} like reverse auctions and competitive
procurements. [[And IFC, and the World Bank Group as a whole, stand
ready to help]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Reject passivity and de-prioritization --- counteracts effect of cognitive bias in shaping political discussion.

Bill **McKibben 18,** April 27, 2018, (American environmentalist,
author, and journalist who has written extensively on the impact of
global warming. He is the Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury
College and leader of the anti-carbon campaign group 350.org.)
\"Hiroshima, Kyoto, and the Bombs of Climate Change,\" New Yorker,
https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/hiroshima-kyoto-and-the-bombs-of-climate-change

I spent Earth Day in Kyoto, the next day in Hiroshima, and the time
since pondering the difference between the two. Hiroshima has a special
grip on the planet's consciousness. To see the remains of the great
explosion is moving, and it's equally powerful to realize that basically
every building you drive by was constructed after 1945. Millions of
people come here to tour the museum---its exhibits all the more
chastening for their dry and almost clinical precision. Hiroshima has
become symbolic shorthand for the nuclear horror that still haunts
humanity; when we think about weapons of mass destruction, it's the
mushroom cloud above the Japanese city that we see in our mind's eye.
Kyoto, in a different way, could have become shorthand for another,
equally huge problem---[global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[is
producing changes even more far-reaching than a nuclear
standoff]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was in Kyoto, twenty-one years ago,
that the world first came together to try to address the climate crisis,
reaching a small but useful agreement to begin limiting carbon
emissions. Yet the pact accomplished little, and has slipped into
history. I saw no sign in Kyoto that the conference ever took place---no
shrine or statue, and, what's more, no discernible change in the way
that the city operates. (Japan met its obligations to the treaty by
using offset techniques, such as planting trees and purchasing carbon
credits, while emissions rose.) In what is a race against time, time has
largely stood still here, as it has in most places. [It's not as if we
have solved the nuclear issue]{.underline}, [but at least we understand
that it is a crisis]{.underline}. The entire act of the North Korean
leader, Kim Jong Un, depends on the collective understanding that these
weapons are uniquely, intolerably awful. [Even]{.underline} Donald
[Trump]{.underline} [dimly groks that denuclearization is
good]{.underline}. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is filled with
the texts of treaties that have brought the number of warheads slowly,
steadily down; [we could see that mushroom cloud and understand its
danger in our gut]{.underline}. [With climate change, it's different.
The explosion of a billion pistons inside a billion cylinders every
minute of every day just doesn't induce the same tremble]{.underline}.
True, Trump is alone among world leaders in dismissing global warming,
but most of his peers might as well agree: they've done very little of
what's required even to begin addressing this issue. As a result, [the
explosions go off constantly]{.underline}. Scientists estimate that,
each day, our added [[emissions trap the heat equivalent of four hundred
thousand Hiroshima]{.mark}-sized [bombs]{.mark},]{.underline} which is
why the Arctic has half as much ice as it did in the nineteen-eighties,
why the great ocean currents have begun to slow, why we see floods and
storms and fires in such sad proportion[. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were
the only atomic bombs we ever dropped]{.underline}; [climate bombs rain
down daily, and the death toll mounts unstoppably]{.underline}. I can
think of several explanations for this difference in attitude. The most
important, probably, lies in the power of the fossil-fuel industry,
which has spent billions of dollars defending the precise practices now
wrecking the planet. The industry's disinformation and lobbying
campaigns---the details of which have slowly come to light, though the
broad outlines have been clear for decades---have been spectacularly
effective. I remember watching the closing moments of the Kyoto
conference, in 1997, as delegates congratulated themselves on what
President Bill Clinton called "a huge first step." I was standing next
to a lobbyist for the energy industry, who had spent much of the week
trying to water down and derail the agreement. He took in my tired
pleasure and said, "I'm glad we're going back to D.C., where we've got
this under control." That turned out to be accurate, though even he
could not have predicted the ultimate success of his work: an American
President who insists that the entire thing is a hoax manufactured by
the Chinese. [Still, global warming doesn't haunt even the uncorrupted
imagination in quite the same way as the bomb, perhaps because it
unfolds more slowly]{.underline}. On a geologic time scale, a day and a
century are roughly the same unit, but for the purposes of a news cycle,
the difference is crucial. [**[Every single day, climate change is the
most important thing happening on the planet]{.mark}**---**[there's
nothing even remotely close]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[But,]{.mark} on
[any single day]{.mark}, [there's always something more dramatic, more
urgent]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It feels as if we have time to deal with
global warming, whereas deportations or assault rifles or lunatics in
white vans mowing down women must be dealt with now]{.underline}. ([In
fact, [climate change is the one problem]{.mark} that the planet has
ever faced [that comes with an absolute time limit]{.mark}; past a
certain point, it won't be a problem anymore, because it won't have a
solution]{.underline}.) And the fact that it's happening everywhere,
which should mean that it engages us more deeply, seems in some ways to
do just the opposite. [Hiroshima was an obvious, hideous breach of the
ordinary]{.underline}. (The curators of the museum at ground zero
understand this: you enter through a room filled with pictures of normal
life in the months leading up to the bombing, and these pictures of
smiling schoolchildren are at least as powerful as the images of charred
bodies by the exit.) [But [the sheer repetition of flood and firestorm
ratchets down the terror]{.mark}]{.underline} some; we're in the process
now of [[routinizing]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark} and the
[destruction]{.mark} it wreaks]{.underline}. It's becoming the baseline.
Hurricane Katrina was shocking; Harvey and Irma and Maria, less so.
Perhaps it doesn't matter. Perhaps the free-falling price of solar and
wind power will be enough to spur the necessary transition. But I doubt
it. Inertia is such a strong force that, [[without]{.mark} a
[decisive]{.mark} [push]{.mark} [from a motivated]{.mark}]{.underline}
human [[population]{.mark}, [we won't]{.mark} make the change in time to
[defuse the climate bomb]{.mark}.]{.underline} That was my sense
watching normal, unchanged life in Kyoto and reading the editorial in
Monday's Yomiuri Shimbun, which called for balancing economic and
environmental interests. [Climate change would be helped, the editors
said, by the advent of new technologies that turned off lights when
people weren't in the room]{.underline}.

[[By not addressing climate change]{.mark} more aggressively and
[creatively]{.mark}, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is squandering]{.mark} an opportunity to
secure its **[global primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the next few
generations to come. [To do this]{.underline}, though, [[the U.S. must
rely on **innovation** to help the world escape the coming
**environmental meltdown**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Developing]{.mark}
the key [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [that will save the planet
from]{.underline} global [warming [will allow the U.S. to
outmaneuver]{.mark}]{.underline} potential **[[great power
rivals]{.underline}]{.mark}** [seeking to replace it as the
international system's hegemon]{.underline}. But the greening of
American strategy must occur soon.¶ [The U.S., however, seems to be
stuck in time, unable to move beyond oil-centric
geo-politics]{.underline} in any meaningful way.¶ Often, the gridlock is
portrayed as a partisan difference, with Republicans resisting action
and Democrats pleading for action.¶ This, though, is an unfair
characterization as there are numerous proactive Republicans and quite a
few reticent Democrats.¶ The real divide is instead one between realists
and liberals.¶ Students of realpolitik, which still heavily guides
American foreign policy, largely discount environmental issues as they
are not seen as advancing national interests in a way that generates
relative power advantages vis-à-vis the other major powers in the
system: Russia, China, Japan, India, and the European Union.¶ Liberals,
on the other hand, have recognized that global warming might very well
become the greatest challenge ever faced by \[hu\]mankind. As such,
their thinking often eschews narrowly defined national interests for the
greater global good. This, though, ruffles elected officials whose sworn
obligation is, above all, to protect and promote American national
interests.¶ What both sides need to understand is that [[by
becoming]{.mark} a lean, mean, [green]{.mark} fighting machine, [the
U.S. can]{.mark}]{.underline} actually bring together liberals and
realists to advance a collective interest which benefits every nation,
while at the same time, [[secur]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [America's
global [primacy]{.mark} well into the future]{.underline}.¶ [To do so,
[the U.S. must re-invent itself]{.mark} [as]{.mark}]{.underline} not
just your traditional hegemon, but as [[history's first]{.mark} ever
green [hegemon]{.mark}.¶]{.underline} Hegemons are countries that
dominate the international system - bailing out other countries in times
of global crisis, establishing and maintaining the most important
international institutions, and covering the costs that result from
free-riding and cheating global obligations. Since 1945, that role has
been the purview of the United States.¶ Immediately after World War II,
Europe and Asia laid in ruin, the global economy required resuscitation,
the countries of the free world needed security guarantees, and the
entire system longed for a multilateral forum where global concerns
could be addressed. The U.S., emerging the least scathed by the systemic
crisis of fascism's rise, stepped up to the challenge and established
the postwar (and current) liberal order.¶ But don't let the world
"liberal" fool you. While many nations benefited from America's
new-found hegemony, the U.S. was driven largely by "realist" selfish
national interests. The liberal order first and foremost benefited the
U.S.¶ With the U.S. becoming bogged down in places like Afghanistan and
Iraq, running a record national debt, and failing to shore up the
dollar, [the future of American hegemony now seems to be facing a
serious contest: potential rivals - acting like sharks smelling blood in
the water - wish to challenge the U.S. on a variety of
fronts]{.underline}. This has led numerous commentators to forecast the
U.S.'s imminent fall from grace.¶ [Not all hope is lost
however.¶]{.underline} [With the impending systemic crisis
of]{.underline} global [warming on the horizon, the U.S. again finds
itself in a position to address a transnational problem in a way that
will benefit both the international community collectively and the U.S.
selfishly.¶]{.underline} The current problem is two-fold. First, the
[[competition for oil is fueling animosities]{.mark} between the major
powers]{.underline}. The [[geopolitics of oil has already emboldened
Russia]{.mark} in its 'near abroad' [and China]{.mark}]{.underline} in
far-off places like Africa and Latin America. As oil is a limited
natural resource, [[a nasty zero-sum contest could be looming]{.mark} on
the horizon for the U.S. and its major power rivals]{.underline} - [a
contest [which threatens American primacy and **global
stability**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}¶ Second, converting fossil fuels
like oil to run national economies is producing irreversible harm in the
form of carbon dioxide emissions. So long as the global economy remains
oil-dependent, greenhouse gases will continue to rise. Experts are
predicting as much as a 60% increase in carbon dioxide emissions in the
next twenty-five years. That likely means more devastating water
shortages, droughts, forest fires, floods, and storms.¶ In other words,
if global competition for access to energy resources does not undermine
international security, global warming will. And in either case, oil
will be a culprit for the instability.¶ Oil arguably has been the most
precious energy resource of the last half-century. But "black gold" is
so 20th century. [The key resource for this century will be green gold -
clean, environmentally-friendly energy like wind, solar, and hydrogen
power]{.underline}. Climate change leaves no alternative. And the sooner
we realize this, the better off we will be.¶ [What Washington must do in
order to avoid the traps of petropolitics is to convert the U.S. into
the world's first-ever green hegemon.¶]{.underline} For starters, the
federal government must drastically increase investment in energy and
environmental research and development (E&E R&D). This will require a
serious sacrifice, committing upwards of \$40 billion annually to E&E
R&D - a far cry from the few billion dollars currently being spent.¶ By
promoting a new national project, the U.S. could develop new
technologies that will assure it does not drown in a pool of oil. Some
solutions are already well known, such as raising fuel standards for
automobiles; improving public transportation networks; and expanding
nuclear and wind power sources. Others, however, have not progressed
much beyond the drawing board: batteries that can store massive amounts
of solar (and possibly even wind) power; efficient and cost-effective
photovoltaic cells, crop-fuels, and hydrogen-based fuels; and even
fusion.¶ Such [**[innovations]{.mark}** will not only provide
alternatives to oil, they [will]{.mark} also [give the U.S. an edge in
the global competition for hegemony. If the U.S. is able to produce
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[that allow modern]{.mark},
globalized [societies to escape the oil trap, those nations
wil]{.mark}l]{.underline} eventually [have no choice but to [adopt such
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies. And [this will give the U.S. a
tremendous economic boom, while simultaneously providing it with means
of leverage that can be employed to keep potential foes in
check.]{.underline}

[[A pilot project to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere and turn it into
pellets that can either be used as fuel or stored underground for later
has been launched]{.mark} by a Vancouver-based start-up called Carbon
Engineering.]{.underline} While the test facility has so far only
extracted 10 tonnes of CO2 since its launch back in June, its operations
will help inform the construction of [a \$200 million commercial plant
in 2017, which is expected to extract 1 million tonnes per
day]{.underline} - the equivalent of taking 100 cars off the road every
year. [[It plans to start selling CO2-based synthetic fuels]{.mark} by
2018. \"[It\'s now possible to take CO2 out of the atmosphere, and use
it as a feed stock, with hydrogen, to produce net zero emission
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline},\" company chief executive Adrian Corless
[told the
AFP.](http://www.afp.com/en/news/canadian-firm-opens-facility-pull-carbon-air)
[Funded by private
investors](http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/environment/canadian-firm-opens-pilot-project-to-pull-carbon-from-air/article/446240),
including billionaires Bill Gates and oil sands financier Murray
Edwards, [Carbon Engineering is [not the only company in the
world](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-are-building-a-system-that-could-turn-atmospheric-co2-into-fuel)
intent on solving our carbon dioxide problems]{.underline}, but it
claims to be the first to demonstrate how its technology can be scaled
up to have both an actual environmental impact and commercial potential.
Instead of tackling the CO2 that pours out of factory smokestacks -
because there are existing machines [that do this pretty
well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage) - the
Carbon Engineering \'direct air capture plant\' will deal with everyday
carbon emissions from buildings, transportation, and agriculture.
\"Emissions from sources you just can\'t otherwise capture,\" [Corless
says.](http://www.afp.com/en/news/canadian-firm-opens-facility-pull-carbon-air)
\"It\'s still a pilot-scale plant,\" [he told CBC
News](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/carbon-capture-squamish-1.3263855).
\"But [it\'s very important, because it\'s the first time that anyone\'s
demonstrated a technology that captures CO2 that has the potential to be
scaled up to be large enough to be relevant from an environmental or
climate point of view.]{.underline}\" As we reported [back at the time
of the test plant
launch](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-are-building-a-system-that-could-turn-atmospheric-co2-into-fuel),
direct air capture works just like [these new solar
cells](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-figure-out-how-to-make-solar-cells-produce-fuel-and-electricity)
that split water into a hydrogen fuel. The recycling plant extracts CO2
from the air using a giant complex of fans and a liquid hydroxide
solution that reacts with the air to form a carbonate mineral. This
carbonate pellet is processed inside a locked vessel and converted back
into carbon dioxide and water vapour, which can be used as fuel, or
stored for later. Carbon Engineering [According to CBC
News,](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/carbon-capture-squamish-1.3263855)
[the larger plant should be able to produce up to 400 litres of gasoline
or diesel per day]{.underline} using this method. [One of the main
things it has going for it is that because it turns the CO2 into fuel,
no change in infrastructure will be needed to power big fuel-guzzlers
such as ships, planes, and long-haulage trucks]{.underline}. Even
existing petrol pumps can work with the fuel. A major limitation of
solar and wind technologies, on the other hand, is that they require
specific technologies to capture and disperse energy. \"[[The nice thing
about the technology is that there are no real limitations for it to
ultimately, in theory, displace all of the existing fossil-based
transportation fuels]{.underline}]{.mark},\" [Corless
said.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/carbon-capture-squamish-1.3263855)
Going forward, the most important thing for Carbon Engineering to figure
out is how to be commercially viable. As Kesavan Unnikrishnan [points
out at Digital
Journal](http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/environment/canadian-firm-opens-pilot-project-to-pull-carbon-from-air/article/446240),
carbon can cost anything from \$1/tonne (Mexico and Poland) to
\$130/tonne (Sweden) around the world, and Carbon Engineering will need
to sell its product at around [\$100/tonne to support itself
commercially](http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/10/08/snatching-co2-back-from-the-air.html)

\[ΔT was changed to "temperature change"\]

One clear message that emerges from Figs. 2.15 and 2.16 is that to
achieve the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, emissions of GHGs must
fall significantly below those used to drive RCP 8.5. The range of
ΔT2100 shown in Fig. 2.16b is 1.6--4.7 °C. **[[Climate
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([rapid rise of sea level, large
shifts in patterns of drought and flooding, loss of
habitat,]{.underline} etc.) [[will]{.mark} **almost certainly
[occur]{.mark}** [by end of this century if the emissions]{.mark} of
GHGs]{.underline}, particularly CO2, [[follow]{.underline}]{.mark} those
used to drive [[RCP 8.5]{.underline}]{.mark}.32 The book Six Degrees:
Our Future on a Hotter Planet (Lynas 2008) provides an accessible
discourse of the consequences of global warming, organized into 1 °C
increments of future ΔT. In the rest of this chapter, policy relevant
projections of ΔT are shown, both from the EM-GC framework and CMIP5
GCMs. Figures 2.17 shows the statistical distribution of ΔT2060 from our
EM-GC calculations. The EM-GC based projections are weighted by 1/χ2
(i.e., the better the fit to the climate record, the more heavily a
particular projection is weighted). The height of each histogram
represents the probability that a particular range of ΔT2060, defined by
the width of each line segment, will occur. In other words, [the most
probable value]{.underline} of ΔT [in]{.underline} year
[2060]{.underline}, [for the EM-GC projection]{.underline} that uses RCP
4.5, [is **1.2--1.3 °C** above pre-industrial]{.underline}, and there is
slightly less than 20 % probability ΔT will actually fall within this
range. In contrast, [the CMIP5 GCMs project]{.underline} ΔT in [2060
will]{.underline} most probably [be **2.0--2.2 °C**]{.underline} [warmer
than pre-industrial]{.underline}, with a \~12 % probability ΔT will
actually fall within this range. A finer spacing for ΔT is used for the
EM-GC projection, since [we are able to **conduct many
simulations**]{.underline} [in this model framework]{.underline}. Figure
2.18 is similar to Fig. 2.17, except the projection is for year 2100.
The collection of histograms shown for any particular model (i.e.,
either CMIP5 GCMs or EM-GC) on a specific figure is termed the
probability distribution function (PDF) for the projection of the rise
in GMST (i.e., ΔT). The [PDFs]{.underline} shown in Figs. 2.17 and 2.18
[reveal **stark differences**]{.underline} [in projections]{.underline}
of ΔT [based on the EM-GC framework and the CMIP5 GCMs. **In all
cases**]{.underline}, ΔT \[[temperature change]{.underline}\] [from the
GCMs **far exceed** projections using our]{.underline} relatively simple
[approach]{.underline} that is **[tightly coupled]{.underline}** [to
observed ΔT, OHC, and various natural factors that influence
climate.]{.underline} These differences are quantified in Table 2.1,
which summarizes the cumulative probability that a specific Paris goal
can be achieved. The cumulative probabilities shown in Table 2.1 are
based on summing the height of each histogram that lies to the left of a
specific temperature, in Figs. 2.17 and 2.18. Time series of ΔT found
using the CMIP5 GCM and EM-GC approaches are illustrated in Figs. 2.19
and 2.20, which show projections based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The
colors represent the probability of a particular future value of ΔT
being achieved, for projections computed in the EM-GC framework weighted
by 1/ χ2 . Essentially, the red (warm), white (mid-point), and blue
(cool) colors represent the visualization of a succession of histograms
like those shown in Figs. 2.17 and 2.18. The GCM CMIP5 projections of ΔT
(minimum, maximum, and multi-model mean) for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 are
shown by the three grey lines. These lines, identical to those shown in
Fig. 2.3a (RCP 4.5) and Fig. 2.3b (RCP 8.5), are based on our analysis
of GCM output preserved on the CMIP5 archive. The green trapezoid, which
originates from Fig. 11.25b of IPCC (2013), makes a final and rather
important appearance on these figures. Also, the Paris target (1.5 °C)
and upper limit (2 °C) are marked on the right vertical axis of both
figures. [There are **resounding policy implications**]{.underline}
inherent in Figs. 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, and 2.20. First, most importantly,
and beyond debate of any reasonable quantitative analysis of climate,
[if GHG emissions follow anything close to RCP 8.5]{.underline}, [there
is **no chance** of achieving either the goal or upper limit of the
Paris climate agreement]{.underline} (Fig. 2.20). Even though there is a
small amount of overlap between the Paris targets and our EM-GC
projections for year 2100 in Fig. 2.20, this is a false hope. In the
highly unlikely event this realization were to actually happen, [[it
would just be a matter of time before]{.underline}]{.mark} ΔT
\[[[temperature change]{.underline}]{.mark}\]
[[broke]{.underline}]{.mark} through [the **[2 °C]{.mark}
barrier**]{.underline}, [with all of the attendant negative
consequences]{.underline} (Lynas 2008). Plus, of course, 1.5--2.0 °C
warming (i.e., the lead up to breaking the 2 °C barrier) could have
rather severe consequences. This outcome is all but guaranteed if GHG
abundances follow that of RCP 8.5. The second policy implication is that
projections of ΔT found using the EM-GC framework indicate that,
[[if]{.mark} [emissions]{.mark} of GHGs [can be limited to]{.mark} those
of [**RCP 4.5**, then]{.mark} by end-century [there
is]{.mark}]{.underline}: (a) [[a **75 %
probability**]{.underline}]{.mark} the Paris target of [[1.5 °C
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} above pre-industrial [[will be
achieved]{.underline}]{.mark} (b) [[a **greater than 95 %
probability**]{.underline}]{.mark} the Paris upper limit of [[2 °C

3, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} cumulative [[effect]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
the **[commitments]{.mark} from nations [to restrict future
emissions]{.mark}** of GHGs]{.underline}, [up[on]{.mark}
which]{.underline} the [[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark} Climate Agreement
[is based, [have the world **on course** to achieve]{.mark} GHG
[emissions]{.mark} that fall **[just below]{.mark} those of [RCP
4.5,]{.mark}**]{.underline} provided: (1) both conditional and
unconditional commitments are followed; (2) reductions in GHG emissions
needed to achieve the Paris agreement, which generally terminate in
2030, are continually improved out to at least 2060. [The policy
implication articulated above]{.underline} **[differs
considerably]{.underline}** [from the consensus]{.underline} in the
climate modeling community [that emission of GHGs must follow RCP 2.6 to
achieve even the 2 °C upper limit of Paris]{.underline} (Rogelj et al.
2016). We caution those quick to dismiss the simplicity of our approach
to consider the emerging view, discussed in Chap. 11 of IPCC (2013) and
quantified in their Figs. 11.25 and TS.14, as well as our Figs. 2.3 and
2.13, that the [CMIP5 GCMs]{.underline} **[warm much
quicker]{.underline}** [than has been observed during the past three
decades]{.underline}. In support of our approach, we emphasize that
[[our projections]{.mark} of ΔT [are bounded **nearly
exactly**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by the]{.underline}]{.mark} green
trapezoid of IPCC (2013), which reflects the [[judgement
of]{.underline}]{.mark} at least one group of [[experts]{.mark} [as to
how]{.mark}]{.underline} ΔT \[[[temperature change]{.underline}\] [will
evolve]{.underline}]{.mark} [over the next two decades]{.underline}.
Given our present understanding of Earth's climate system, we contend
the [[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark} Climate Agreement is a beacon of hope
because it [[places the world on a course of]{.mark} having a reasonable
probability of **[avoiding climate
catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### AT: Adapt to warming

#### Adaptation fails

[Global [change]{.mark} will [strike]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} oldest and [[most complex]{.mark}
[ecosystems]{.mark} of the world [hardest]{.mark}, [regardless
of]{.mark} their [past stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. This alarming
finding is reported in a JRC-led article published in *Nature
Communications*. The authors hypothesized that [invasive
species]{.underline}, the [[warming]{.mark} climate and environmental
degradation]{.underline} have [[altered]{.mark} natural
[habitats]{.mark} **[so deeply]{.mark}** that species
[adaptation]{.mark} to historical conditions [may not be helpfu]{.mark}l
under these new circumstances]{.underline}. Interestingly, the authors
[found]{.underline} independent [[support]{.underline}]{.mark} for this
hypothesis [[from]{.mark} [both]{.mark} **[computer
simulations]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[real-world
data]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Starting from a single ancestor digital
organism, the authors let artificial life communities evolve for
hundreds of thousands of generations under different, stable
environmental settings. These simulated communities included both
free-living and \'parasite\' digital organisms that helped researchers
investigate how biodiversity and ecological networks develop over time,
under different environmental conditions. Over several generations, both
hosts and parasites diversified, and their interactions became more
complex. The [authors]{.underline} then investigated how these
communities would respond to different scenarios of biodiversity loss.
They [found]{.underline} that [[when species]{.mark} [become]{.mark}
[extinct]{.mark} in a sequence [consistent with]{.mark} their degree of
adaptation to]{.underline} the [[\'natural\']{.mark} environmental
[conditions]{.mark} within which they had evolved, [their
extinction]{.mark} [has]{.mark} only a [limited
effect]{.mark}]{.underline} on the overall diversity of the community.
[Any [deviation from this]{.mark} pattern [however]{.mark}, may
[trigger]{.mark} **[extinction cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline},
eventually [leading to the **[collapse]{.mark}** of **[the entire
network]{.mark}**. The tendency of consuming species to rely and
specialise]{.underline} (develop in a way most suited to the
environment) [on dependable resources]{.underline} has
[enabled]{.underline} the [evolution of complex systems. This basic
mechanism may have doomed many species to extinction]{.underline} \--
the authors demonstrate it by comparing the results of their artificial
life simulations with several empirical host-parasite networks of
different animal groups. Resources that had been largely available in
the past are now becoming increasingly scarce, putting at risk the
species that rely on them.

#### Warming is [existential]{.underline}---adaptation fails 

**Klein 14 --** Naomi Klein, award-winning journalist, syndicated
columnist, former Miliband Fellow at the London School of Economics,
member of the board of directors of 350.org, This Changes Everything:
Capitalism vs. the Climate, pp. 12-14

But the bigger problem---and the reason Copenhagen caused such great
despair---is that because governments did not agree to binding targets,
they are free to pretty much ignore their commitments. Which is
precisely what is happening. Indeed, emissions are rising so rapidly
that unless something radical changes within our economic structure[, 2
degrees now looks like a utopian dream.]{.underline} And it's not just
environmentalists who are raising the alarm. [The World
Bank]{.underline} also warned when it [released its report
that]{.underline} "[[we're on track to a 4-C]{.mark} warmer
[world]{.mark}]{.underline} \[by century's end\] [[marked by]{.mark}
extreme [heat waves, declining]{.mark} global [food]{.mark} stocks,
[loss of ecosystems]{.mark} and biodiversity, [and]{.mark}
life-threatening [sea level rise]{.mark}]{.underline}." And the report
cautioned that, "[[there is]{.mark} also [no certainty that
adaptation]{.mark} to a 4-C world [is possible]{.mark}]{.underline}."
Kevin [Anderson,]{.underline} former director (now [deputy director) of
the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change]{.underline}, which has quickly
established itself [as one of the U.K's premier climate research
institutions, is even blunter; he says]{.underline} [4 degrees Celsius
warming]{.underline}---7.2 degrees Fahrenheit---[is "incompatible with
an organized, equitable, and civilized global community]{.underline}."¶
We don't know exactly what a 4 degree Celsius world would look like, but
even the best-case scenario is likely to be calamitous. [[Four
degrees]{.mark} of warming [could raise global sea levels]{.mark} by 1
or possibly even 2 meters [by 2100]{.mark}]{.underline} (and would lock
in at least a few additional meters over future centuries). This would
drown some island nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu, and inundate
many coastal areas from Ecuador and Brazil to the Netherlands to much of
California and the northeastern United States as well as huge swaths of
South and Southeast Asia. Major cities likely in jeopardy include
Boston, New York, greater Los Angeles, Vancouver, London, Mumbai, Hong
Kong, and Shanghai.¶ Meanwhile, [brutal heat waves that can kill tens of
thousands of people]{.underline}, even in wealthy countries, [would
become entirely unremarkable summer events on every continent but
Antarctica]{.underline}. [The [heat would]{.mark} also [cause staple
crops to suffer dramatic]{.mark} yield [losses]{.mark} across the
globe]{.underline} (it is possible that Indian wheat and U.S. could
plummet by as much as 60 percent), this at a time [when demand will be
surging due to population growth and a growing demand for
meat]{.underline}. And since crops will be facing not just heat stress
but also extreme events such as wide-ranging droughts, flooding, or pest
outbreaks, the [losses could easily turn out to be more severe than the
models have predicted]{.underline}. [When you [add]{.mark} ruinous
[hurricanes]{.mark}, raging [wildfires, fisheries collapse]{.mark}s,
widespread [disruptions to water]{.mark} supplies, [extinctions,
and]{.mark} globe-trotting [diseases]{.mark} to the mix, it indeed
becomes difficult to imagine that a peaceful, ordered society could be
sustained]{.underline} (that is, where such a thing exists in the first
place).¶ And keep in mind that [these are the optimistic scenarios in
which warming is more or less stabilized at 4 degrees Celsius and does
not trigger tipping points beyond which [runaway warming would
occur]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Based on the latest modeling, it is
becoming safer to assume that [[4]{.mark} degrees [could bring
about]{.mark} a number of extremely dangerous [feedback
loops]{.mark}]{.underline}---an Arctic that is regularly ice-free in
September, for instance, or, according to one recent study, [global
vegetation that is too saturated to act as a reliable
"sink]{.underline}", leading to more carbon being emitted rather than
stored. [Once this happens, any hope of predicting impacts pretty much
goes out the window]{.underline}. And this process may be starting
sooner than anyone predicted. In May 2014, [NASA and]{.underline} the
[U]{.underline}niversity of [C]{.underline}alifornia, [Irvine scientists
revealed]{.underline} that [glacier melt]{.underline} in a section of
West Antarctica roughly the size of France now "[appears
unstoppable]{.underline}." This likely spells down for the entire West
Antarctic ice sheet, which according to lead study author Eric Rignot
"comes with a sea level rise between three and five metres. Such an
event will displace millions of people worldwide." [The disintegration,
however, could unfold over centuries and there is still time for
emission reductions to slow down the process and prevent the
worst]{.underline}. ¶ Much more frightening than any of this is the fact
that [plenty of mainstream analysts think that]{.underline} on our
current emissions trajectory, [[we are headed for]{.mark} even [more
than 4 degrees]{.mark} of warming]{.underline}. In 2011, [the usually
staid International Energy Agency]{.underline} (IEA) [issued a report
predicting that]{.underline} [we are actually on track for [6
degrees]{.mark} Celsius]{.underline}---10.8 degrees Fahrenheit---of
warming. And as the IEA's chief economist put it: "Everybody, even the
school children, knows that [this [will have catastrophic
implications]{.mark} for all of us]{.underline}." (The evidence
indicates that [[6 degrees]{.mark} of warming [is likely to set in
motion]{.mark} several [major tipping points]{.mark}]{.underline}---not
only slower ones such as the aforementioned breakdown of the West
Antarctic ice sheet, but possibly more abrupt ones,
[[like]{.underline}]{.mark} [massive [releases of methane from]{.mark}
Arctic [permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}.) The accounting giant
PricewaterhouseCoopers as also published a report warning businesses
that we are headed for "4-C , or even 6-C" of warming.¶ These various
projections are the equivalent of every alarm in your house going off
simultaneously. And then every alarm on your street going off as well,
one by one by one. They mean, quite simply, that **[[climate change has
become an existential crisis]{.mark} for the human
species]{.underline}**. The only historical precedent for a crisis of
this depth and scale was the Cold War fear that we were headed toward
nuclear holocaust, which would have made much of the planet
uninhabitable. But that was (and remains) a threat; a slim possibility,
should geopolitics spiral out of control. [The vast majority of nuclear
scientists never told us that we were almost certainly going to put our
civilization in peril if we kept going about our daily lives as usual,
doing exactly what we were already going, which is what climate
scientists have been telling us for years]{.underline}. ¶ As the Ohio
State University climatologist Lonnie G. Thompson, a world-renowned
specialist on glacier melt, explained in 2010,
"[Climatologists]{.underline}, like other scientists, [tend to be a
stolid group. We are not given to theatrical rantings]{.underline} about
falling skies. Most of us are far more comfortable in our laboratories
or gathering data in the field than we are giving interviews to
journalists or speaking before Congressional committees. [When then are
climatologists speaking out about the dangers of global
warming?]{.underline} The answer is that virtually [[all of
us]{.underline} [are]{.underline}]{.mark} [now [convinced that]{.mark}
global [warming poses a]{.mark} clear and present [danger to
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}."

#### Even shocks cause nuclear war and disease

**Cribb 14**---Canberra science writer \[Julian Cribb, "Human
extinction: it is possible?" [Sydney Morning Herald]{.underline},
Published: April 2, 2014, p.
http://www.smh.com.au/comment/human-extinction-it-is-possible-20140402-zqpln.html\]

However [our]{.underline} [own behaviour is liable to be a]{.underline}
far [more immediate determinant of human survival or
extinction]{.underline}. Above two degrees -- which we have already
locked in -- [the world's [food harvest is going to become increasingly
unreliable]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change warned this week. [[That means]{.mark} **mid-century
[famines]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} places like [[**India**,
**China**, the **Middle East** and **Africa**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But
what scientists cannot predict is how humans living in the tropics and
subtropics will respond to this form of stress. So let us turn to the
strategic and military think tanks, who like to explore such scenarios,
instead.

The Age of Consequences study by the US Centre for Strategic and
International Studies says that under a 2.6 degree rise "nations around
the world will be overwhelmed by the scale of change and pernicious
challenges, such as pandemic disease. The [[internal
cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark} of nations [[will be under]{.mark} great
[stress]{.mark}]{.underline}...[as a result of]{.underline} a dramatic
rise in migration and [changes in agricultural patterns]{.underline} and
water availability. The flooding of coastal communities around the
world... has the potential to challenge regional and even national
identities. [[Armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} between nations [[over
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}... [[is likely and **nuclear war is
possible**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The social consequences range from
increased religious fervour to outright chaos." Of five degrees -- which
the world is on course for by 2100 if present carbon emissions continue
-- it simply says the consequences are \"inconceivable\".

[[Eighteen nations]{.mark} currently [have nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} technology [or access to it, **[raising the
stakes on nuclear conflict]{.mark} to the highest level** since the end
of the Cold War]{.underline}. At the same time, with more than 4 billion
people living in the world's most vulnerable regions, scope for refugee
tsunamis and pandemic disease is also large. [It is on the basis of
scenarios such as these that]{.underline} scientists like Peter
Schellnhuber -- [[science advisor to German
President]{.underline}]{.mark} Angela Merkel -- and Canadian author
Gwynne Dyer have [[warned of the]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[**loss
of most of the human population** in the conflicts, famines and
pandemics]{.mark} spinning out of climate impacts]{.underline}. [Whether
that adds up to extinction or not rather depends on how many of the
world's 20,000 nukes are let off in the process]{.underline}. These
issues all involve assumptions about human, national and religious
behaviour and are thus beyond the remit of scientific bodies like the
IPCC, which can only hint at what they truly think will happen. So you
are not getting the full picture from them.

### AT: US Not Key

#### U.S. emits more than 1/6 of emissions and its participation is symbolically important for other countries 

#### US reductions are modeled globally

**Schmidt 2014,** Jake Director of the International Program at the
Natural Resources Defense Council, fourteen years' experience in climate
policy development including state, US national, Europe, developing
countries, and international negotiations, 11/7/14, "U.S. Can Still
Implement Strong International Climate Actions,"
http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jschmidt/us_climate_actions.html

Domestic opponents of strong U.S. climate action have always complained
that if the U.S. acted "unilaterally," that no one else would act
(almost two decades ago they used the catch phrase "It's not global and
it won't work"). They claimed to support [a global response to climate
change]{.underline} that requires strong actions by all key countries.
Luckily for them this [is exactly what the U.S. and other countries are
preparing to agree next year]{.underline}. The agreement to be reached
next December will have strong commitments from key countries to
continue to implement actions to address their climate pollution and to
take even bolder steps by 2025. As I discussed recently [you can see
strong evidence that this is emerging as China will be prepared for bold
climate targets next year]{.underline} and Europe has already outlined
its next round of climate targets. Similar signs are emerging in other
key countries around the world such as India, Mexico, and South Korea.
At the same time, [[international action]{.mark} on climate change [is
dependent on]{.mark} the actions that [countries]{.mark} take [at
home]{.mark}.]{.underline} When President Obama articulated the Climate
Action Plan he boosted [[U.S. international]{.mark} [credibility]{.mark}
on climate [change]{.mark} [as countries have **always craved strong
U.S.**]{.mark} **domestic [action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As [one of
the]{.mark} world's **[largest economies]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[major
emitter]{.mark}**, [the]{.mark} actions of the [U.S. **matter a
lot.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Following the election we will have to fight
back efforts to undermine President Obama's domestic climate change
actions, but what the President is implementing is based upon the laws
that Congress has already passed. And as President Obama said: "Congress
will pass some bills I cannot sign." We expect him to veto bills to gut
his efforts on climate change (as reported in The Hill). And the new
Congress lacks the votes to override him. On the international level,
the story is essentially the same. [What the U.S. commits to next year
as a part of the new international agreement will clearly be based upon
the laws enshrined in the U.S.]{.underline} The President has
implemented or set in motion [[strong actions for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[key sectors]{.underline} of the U.S. economy [including the
[electricity]{.mark} sector]{.underline}, transportation, and
hydrofluorocarbons that **[[put the U.S. on a]{.mark}
[trajectory]{.mark} [to meet their]{.mark} current climate
[target]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Through existing law the U.S. can make
strong commitments to cut carbon pollution in 2025 that are ambitious,
economically achievable, and legally achievable. We expect that the U.S.
will lay out an ambitious climate target early next year. [U.S. action
helps to [spur]{.mark} [international action]{.mark} on climate
change]{.underline}. **[[By acting aggressively]{.mark} at-home [the
U.S. is in a stronger]{.mark} [position]{.mark} [to achieve]{.mark}
strong [commitments from]{.mark} [other]{.mark}
countrie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This creates a positive dynamic
where U.S. action helps to solidify even more action.]{.underline} We
expect challenges to these efforts from those that want to deny that
climate change exists or entities that want to continue to dump
unlimited carbon pollution in to the air. But those efforts go against
what the American public wants. A recent ABC/Washington Post survey, for
instance, found that 7 in 10 Americans view climate change as a serious
problem and support federal action to reduce carbon pollution. And a
growing group of businesses understand that failure to act on climate
change hurts their bottom-line and that taking bold action is achievable
(for example see these leading companies). [Strong U.S. domestic and
international action on climate change]{.underline} is what the American
public and businesses want. It is enshrined in the U.S. domestic law. It
[is what our children and grandchildren need]{.underline}. President
Obama can continue to lead on this effort by fully implementing the
steps in the Climate Action Plan and helping to secure a strong
international agreement next year.

### AT: Won't Withdraw

#### Dem presidential victory key to staying in Paris agreement

Chelsea **Harvey**, 6-5-20**17**, Withdrawing from the Paris deal takes
four years. Our next president could join again in 30 days., Washington
Post,

[While President [Trump]{.mark} has [[vowed to]{.mark} formally
[withdraw from]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark} climate
agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/06/01/trumps-paris-decision-comes-today-with-the-world-watching/?utm_term=.31699f2ed96c)]{.underline},
sparking international outrage, it doesn't necessarily mean the end of
U.S. involvement forever. [[A future president could]{.mark} have us
[back in the agreement in]{.mark} as little as [30
days]{.mark}]{.underline}, legal experts say. [Under the rules of the
Paris agreement, parties are allowed to exit and reenter as they choose,
although withdrawing is a much lengthier legal process than
returning.]{.underline} And there are no provisions stipulating how much
time has passed after withdrawal before a nation can begin the process
of rejoining the agreement. "A subsequent president would thus be able
to submit a document stating the United States' intention to become a
party to the Agreement as soon as she or he wanted to," [Michael
Burger](http://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/michael-burger), executive
director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law
School, said in an email to The Washington Post --- although he added
that such an action is certainly outside the norm. "Countries don't
typically withdraw from complex international agreements that they led
the way in negotiating," he said. The rules of withdrawal [As it is,
Trump's verbal pledge to withdraw, which he revealed in an
internationally resounding announcement last week, is not final --- yet,
anyway.]{.underline} Withdrawal requires a formal process, which will
take nearly four years to complete. The earliest a U.S. withdrawal could
be finalized is Nov. 4, 2020[. According to the [rules of the Paris
agreement](https://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/paris_agreement_english_.pdf),
nations wishing to exit must first submit a document to the United
Nations specifying their intent to withdraw. However, this is permitted
only after three years have passed since the agreement entered into
force --- and that date was Nov. 4, 2016. This means that the U.S. can
submit its written notice Nov. 4, 2019, at the earliest. After that, the
rules specify that the official withdrawal will take effect exactly one
year later at the earliest, or potentially on a later date of the
party's choosing.]{.underline} In that intervening year, a nation may
decide to cancel its withdrawal at any point, said Maria Manguiat, a
climate expert with the United Nations Environment Program's Law
Division. "It doesn't make the country look very good, but legally it's
entitled to do that," she told The Washington Post. [Altogether, if
Trump acted as quickly as possible to withdraw from the agreement, the
process could be [completed]{.mark} Nov. 4, 2020, at the earliest.
That's [the day after the next presidential
election]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rejoining the agreement And as Burger
pointed out, [[there's nothing stopping a future president from adding
us right back in]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to the agreement's
rules, parties may officially join in one of two ways. First, they can
join by signature and ratification --- that is, by participating in the
agreement's original negotiations and then signing on board. This is how
the United States originally became a part of the agreement. After the
deadline for signature has passed, which occurred April 21 of this year,
parties may join through a process called accession, which is
essentially the legal term for joining an agreement at a later date,
after it has already been negotiated and signed by other nations.
Parties that join by accession are subject to all the same conditions as
parties that joined by signature, and nothing in the rules prevents a
nation from joining by signature, withdrawing and then rejoining by
accession. [According to Manguiat, [the United States could do just that
by simply submitting another document to the United Nations]{.mark},
which it may do at any time after withdrawal takes effect --- even
immediately, if the president so chose. [Its reentry would take legal
effect just 30 days later]{.mark}. In theory, our next president could
start this process immediately upon taking office --- potentially right
after the Jan. 20, 2021, inauguration, if a transition occurs at that
time. And in the meantime, it's likely that rejoining [Paris will
feature]{.mark} as [a key campaign promise for]{.mark} any [liberal
candidates]{.mark} running against Trump in 2020]{.underline}.
International outrage aside, [polls suggested that [most Americans
want]{.mark}ed the U.S. [to remain in]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark}
agreement[, and]{.mark} it's likely that [many]{.mark} would [support an
immediate reentry]{.mark} under a new leader.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
the United States can actually keep participating in Paris negotiations
The country will legally remain a party to the agreement and have a seat
at the table in future Paris-related negotiations until it officially
exits. It's unclear how involved the United States will be in these
processes now that the intent to withdraw has been announced. According
to Manguiat, there are important negotiations still coming up in the
next few years that the United States has the potential to influence
while it's still a party to the agreement. Among these is the crafting
of the Paris "rule book," a set of guidelines on how parties should
communicate updates on their domestic climate action, review their
collective progress and other issues related to the implementation and
enforcement of the agreement. These guidelines are supposed to be
completed in 2018, according to Manguiat, meaning the United States will
still have the opportunity to be involved. "Whether that means that the
U.S. would still insist on certain positions or whether it will take a
backseat knowing that it won't be in the agreement in a few years, no
one can tell," she said.

[Just as the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [appeared poised
to take a victory lap after securing a string of successes on climate
change]{.underline}, Donald [Trump was elected]{.underline} to the U.S.
presidency, [suggesting that Washington might abandon its leadership
role]{.underline} instead. [Trump]{.underline} and his advisers have
[vowed to withdraw]{.underline} the United States [from climate accords
abroad and to abandon]{.underline} President Barack [Obama's push for
clean energy at home]{.underline}.¶ [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[keeps]{.mark} those
[promises, China will]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[step into
the]{.mark} leadership [vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline} left by the United
States. **[At first glance, that might seem like good news, since China
is the world's largest emitter]{.underline}** of greenhouse gases, leads
the world in the production and deployment of clean energy, and will
probably meet the international climate-action pledges it has made so
far.¶ The trouble is that China would lead on climate-change issues only
insofar as doing so would advance its national interests. Some of those
interests, such as China's desire to cultivate foreign markets for clean
energy exports and curb domestic air pollution, [line up with combatting
climate change. Others, such as the **[incentives the country faces to
export coal]{.mark} power plants abroad, [could get in the way of
reducing emissions]{.mark}**. In some cases, it is unclear where China's
interests lie---for example, whether it wants to promote or stunt
breakthrough innovations in clean-energy technologies]{.underline}.

standing]{.underline}]{.mark}** and position in the race to supply the

precipitously]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a result.¶ THE COST OF RETREAT¶
Washington helped shepherd a breakthrough on climate change in late
2015, when 195 countries signed the Paris agreement, under which
governments volunteered action plans to control their greenhouse gas
emissions. The Obama administration played a crucial role in building
the international consensus around that agreement, and it coordinated
the deal's rapid entry into force just a year later, after 115 countries
had ratified it. Together with the several ancillary deals that the
United States recently helped broker---aimed at limiting refrigerant
emissions that warm the earth, curbing the carbon footprint of aviation,
and hashing out financial assistance that will help developing countries
address climate change---the Paris agreement gave the range of climate
accomplishments secured during the Obama administration's final year a
breathtaking scope.¶ China is now poised to build up an advanced nuclear
industry at the United States' expense.¶ These [[successes have earned
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[diplomatic [capital,]{.mark} particularly [among]{.mark} its [European
allies]{.mark}, that it would be foolish to squander. **[Reversing
course]{.mark} on climate policy [could enrage]{.mark} the United
States' [partners]{.mark} across the Atlantic [and might make them less
willing to cooperate on Washington's geopolitical interests, such
as]{.mark}** presenting a unified front [**against Russian
aggression**,]{.mark} and its economic ones, such as the repatriation of
corporate profits stashed in Europe. Nevertheless, the president-elect's
advisers have exuberantly described Trump's plans to withdraw the United
States from the Paris agreement and possibly even the overarching 1992
international framework]{.underline} for climate diplomacy. On the
campaign trail, Trump vowed to cancel payments to UN climate bodies,
such as the Green Climate Fund, which provides financial assistance to
developing countries. He also pledged to repeal Obama's Clean Power
Plan, thus reducing the likelihood that the United States will uphold
its international commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by
at least 26 percent relative to 2005 levels before 2025.¶ In a sign of
its willingness to take over the mantle of climate leadership, China has
strongly denounced Trump's promises. Senior Chinese officials have urged
the United States to uphold its climate commitments, and Beijing has
pledged to make good on its own regardless of what the next
administration does.¶ [The opportunity to take over climate
leadership]{.underline} from the United States [would be a gift to
China]{.underline}. Facing international tensions on several fronts,
from it posture in the South China Sea to its tacit support for North
Korea, [Beijing stands to gain prestige and goodwill abroad]{.underline}
by leading on climate change. And now that the United States has done
the heavy diplomatic lifting of rallying the world to reach an agreement
in Paris, China can earn plaudits just by publicly prodding other
countries to live up to the pledges they signed up for. China, for its
part, will have no problem meeting its own climate pledge---it has
promised to reduce its emissions from 2030 onward, and economists
forecast that slowing economic growth will naturally lead to a peak in
Chinese emissions well before then.

#### US-Russia war causes extinction

**Fisher 15** (Max, Foreign affairs columnist at VOX, \"How World War
III became possible,\" 6/29,
http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war)

That is why, analysts will tell you, [today\'s **tensions** bear far
more similarity to]{.underline} the period before [**World War I**: an
unstable power balance, belligerence over peripheral conflicts,
entangling military commitments, disputes over]{.underline} the future
of [the European order, and dangerous uncertainty]{.underline} about
what actions will and will not force the other party into conflict.
[Today\'s **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, once more the strongest
nation in Europe and yet weaker than its collective enemies, [calls to
mind the turn-of-the-century German Empire]{.underline}, which Henry
Kissinger described as \"too big for Europe, but too small for the
world.\" Now, as then, [a rising power, propelled by nationalism, [is
**seeking to revise the European order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now, as
then, it believes that through superior cunning, and perhaps even by
proving its might, it can force a larger role for itself. Now, as then,
the drift toward war is gradual and easy to miss --- which is exactly
what makes it so dangerous. But [there is one way in which today\'s
dangers are less like those before World War I]{.underline}, and more
similar to those of the Cold War: **[the apocalyptic logic of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. [[Mutual suspicion]{.mark}, [fear]{.mark} of an
existential threat[, armies parked across]{.mark} [borders]{.mark} from
one another, [and hair-trigger]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark} all
**[make any small skirmish]{.mark} a potential
[armageddon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In some ways, that logic has grown
even more dangerous. [Russia]{.underline}, hoping to compensate for its
conventional military forces\' relative weakness, [has dramatically
relaxed its rules for using nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Whereas Soviet
leaders saw their nuclear weapons as pure deterrents, something that
existed precisely so they would never be used, Putin\'s view appears to
be radically different. [**[Russia\'s]{.mark}** official [nuclear
doctrine calls on]{.mark} the country to **launch a [battlefield nuclear
strike]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} case of a **[conventional war]{.mark}**
that could pose an existential threat]{.underline}. These are more than
just words: Moscow has repeatedly signaled its willingness and
preparations to use nuclear weapons even in a more limited war. [This is
a **terrifyingly low bar** for nuclear weapons use]{.underline},
particularly given that any war would likely occur along Russia\'s
borders and thus not far from Moscow. And it suggests Putin has adopted
an idea that Cold War leaders considered unthinkable: that a \"limited\"
nuclear war, of small warheads dropped on the battlefield, could be not
only survivable but winnable. \"It's not just a difference in rhetoric.
It's a whole different world,\" Bruce G. Blair, a nuclear weapons
scholar at Princeton, told the Wall Street Journal. He called Putin\'s
decisions more dangerous than those of any Soviet leader since 1962.
\"There's a low nuclear threshold now that didn't exist during the Cold
War.\" Nuclear theory is complex and disputable; maybe Putin is right.
But many theorists would say he is wrong, that the logic of nuclear
warfare means [a \"limited\" nuclear strike is in fact likely to trigger
a larger nuclear war]{.underline} --- **[a doomsday
scenario]{.underline}** [in which major American, Russian, and European
cities would be targets]{.underline} for attacks many times more
powerful than the bombs that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [**Even
if** a nuclear war did somehow remain **limited**]{.underline} and
contained, recent [studies suggest that environmental and atmospheric
[damage **would cause a \"decade of winter**]{.mark}]{.underline}\" and
mass crop die-outs that could kill up to 1 billion people in a global
famine.

### 2NC Econ Mod

#### Second-term Trump collapses the global economy and causes fast unstable retrenchment from U.S. international commitments

Patrick **Porter 18**, Chair in International Security and Strategy at
the University of Birmingham, 8/6/18, "CRISIS AND CONVICTION: U.S. GRAND
STRATEGY IN TRUMP'S SECOND
TERM," <https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/crisis-and-conviction-u-s-grand-strategy-in-trumps-second-term/>

Thus far, the bottom line about [[Trump]{.mark}'s]{.underline}
presidency is that before he took office, he [threatened to govern as an
isolationist, but]{.underline} he [has not]{.underline}. Instead of
addressing the failures of primacy, he is exacerbating them. When
running for office, Trump promised to extricate America from unnecessary
wars. He toyed with the idea of tolerating others' nuclear
proliferation. He pronounced NATO to be "obsolete." He took up the
slogan of interwar isolationism, "America First." This worldview
persists. He is no convert to the traditional ethos of the Pax
Americana. In his contractual view of international affairs, [he [would
prefer to draw down]{.mark}]{.underline} global military deployments. He
would prefer not to be bound by alliance commitments. He would rather
accommodate other major powers and let them dominate their back yards.
He would be content for regional powers to be security providers. And he
has no time for the traditional logic that the hegemon pays more than
the lion's share of the defense bill in order to keep allies
subordinate[. He has not governed this way. Look beyond the tweets to
follow the money and the troops. Trump is aggressively reasserting
American primacy, not dismantling it]{.underline}. Rather than bringing
the legions home, Trump is reinforcing their central importance,
emptying the treasury to strengthen them, and even asking for military
parades. Thanks to his deficit-financed military build-up plus his
extravagant tax cuts, the annual budget deficit has ballooned by 12
percent since last year, and is projected to rise by an additional \$100
billion a year. In the Middle East, Trump has doubled down on America's
bid to remain predominant for the foreseeable future, increasing
civilian and military deployments by 33 percent (as of November 2017)
along with accelerated arms sales, whilestrengthening ties with the
Saudi bloc and Israel to confront and coerce Iran, America's main rival
in the region. In Asia, Trump has pursued the nuclear disarmament of
North Korea while [[increasingly confronting China]{.underline}]{.mark}
about Taiwan, trade, [and the South China Sea]{.underline}. We can
debate what to call this, but it isn't isolationism. The disjuncture
between Trump's anti-traditionalism and American deeds, indeed between
Trump and the policy thrust of the executive branch, is most apparent in
U.S.-Russian relations. Trump's notorious words are often contradicted
by the details of actual policy. Trump stands accused of treasonous
collaboration with Vladimir Putin's regime, due not only to allegations
of electoral interference and private one-on-one meetings, but
deferential statements about Russia's security interests, congratulating
Putin on re-election, and suggesting that Russia be invited back to the
G-7. But amid the U.S. foreign policy establishment's fascination for
the extent of Trump's collusion with Putin, its almost Trumpian fixation
with televisual optics, and its fondness for grandiose tracts about
"world order," it neglects the prosaic details of concrete commitments.
Consider the totality of American policy towards Russia since January
2017, which is the product of multiple decision-making centers, and some
of which is forged despite Trump. Around the infamous Brussels and
Helsinki reports, a significant act went under-reported. Before he went
to Brussels, Trump addressed the Three Seas Initiative at Warsaw, where
he pitched the United States as an alternative energy supplier to
Russia, explicitly to break Russia's gas monopoly, his Energy Secretary
presented the United States as an alternative market provider to the
Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Moscow noticed with displeasure. Whether or not
Trump threatened to quit NATO, its members are spending evermore on
defense, which is not a happy result for Russia. [Despite protestations,
European states retain powerful incentives to stick with Washington.
There are no signs of their abandoning the alliance to
rearm]{.underline} independently [or bandwagon with other
powers]{.underline}. Consider too other measures. He has appointed
hawkish American primacists and Putin critics to Russia-related official
posts. He has expanded sanctions, including an expanded Magnitsky list
of targets. The Justice Department has forced Russia Today to register
as a foreign agent. Trump has expelled Russian diplomats. Trump has
armed Ukraine, Romania and Poland. The U.S. has reinforced NATO's
enhanced forward presence in Poland and the Baltic states with increased
troop numbers and more exercises, and presided over the expansion of
NATO into Montenegro and Macedonia, against Russian efforts to keep its
clients in the Balkans and resist E.U.-NATO enlargement, while courting
Ukraine and Georgia as future alliance members. The United States also
acquires low-yield nuclear weapons with the explicit rationale of
competition against Moscow, to remain "top of the pack" among nuclear
powers. Trump twice authorized airstrikes against Syria, Russia's Middle
Eastern client state, against Putin's protests. He also loosened the
rules of engagement in Syria, struck Russian troops and mercenaries
there and bragged about it. So far, the U.S. refuses to recognize Crimea
as part of Russia. Is this Putin's dream? Some commentators, like Daniel
Vajdich and James Carafano, maintain this confrontational stance is
Trump's own. Carafano attributes Trump's reassertion of American
hegemony to a coherent Trumpian vision, a "large dose of peace through
strength: showing strong face to his enemies with military and economic
pressure," while offering them a "chance to stop competing." This is an
elegant explanation. But it overstates the president's command of the
policy process. The picture that emerges is more fraught. A surer
verdict must await future archives, but from the pattern of what we can
know about the process behind these choices, [a reluctant Trump is
constrained to maintain a hard-line policy mix]{.underline}. This is
despite his public braggadocio and despite his instinctive belief that
Washington should delegate anti-Putin countermeasures to Europeans.
Similarly, [he retains a personal preference for pulling troops
out]{.underline} of Afghanistan, South Korea, and Syria. Yet advisors
pressed him successfully to maintain the traditional U.S. posture so
far. "You guys want me to send troops everywhere," Trump charged
Secretary of Defense Mattis, whose response ("You have no choice")
carried the day. As well as being subject to constant advice to maintain
a tough stance on Russian adventurism, domestic criticism of any
conciliation of Russia and the Mueller investigation that the foreign
policy establishment has encouraged have led Trump to complain that he
"can't put on the charm" or "be president." Trump acknowledges that he
is boxed in: "Anything you do, it's always going to be... 'He loves
Russia.'" "I just want peace," he complained when aides pushed him
(successfully) to supply lethal aid to the Ukraine. The White House
initially invited Putin to visit Washington, but subsequently postponed
the occasion, citing the "Russia witch hunt." If Trump had his way, as
one former official put it, he would purse a "much more open and
friendly policy with Russia." [So far, he hasn't had his
way]{.underline} on most first order questions. The environment is too
resistant. The actor is not determined enough [and doesn't have enough
political capital to spend]{.underline}. True, in the field of
economics, Trump's stoking of trade wars and large leaps in
protectionism are a departure from post-Cold War policies, though he
adheres to the impulse of creating markets open for American business
and on American terms. On security questions, though, if it is hard
politically to arrange a Putin visit to the White House, the constraints
against doing what Moscow would like, negotiating a "Yalta-2" grand
bargain to recognize a Russian sphere of influence --- or withdraw from
Europe --- are strong. It is thus premature to argue that Trump is "[off
the chain]{.underline}," as Hal Brands does. Brands notes that the
constraining influence of Secretary Jim Mattis has waned, now that he
has fallen out of favor, and that Trump is increasingly being Trump. Yet
none of the concrete policies identified above have lapsed. And to focus
on palace intrigue over which appointee is in the ascendancy is to miss
the larger pattern. While Trump periodically falls out with just about
everyone, the policy ecosystem is dominated by primacists and the
primacy consensus. Though Tillerson and McMaster fell from grace and
departed, the pool of capable talent from which the president selected
appointees remains primacist. As Steve Bannon once observed, once you
remove anti-Trump neoconservatives and never-Trumpers, the group of
viable conservative candidates for official positions is not a "deep
bench." Accordingly, Trump has [replaced estranged hawkish primacists
with even more hawkish primacists]{.underline} as his new consiglieres:
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John
Bolton, alongside U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley who endures as the
unapologetic voice of superpower assertion. The Precipice: Trump's
Second Term We would be wise to [entertain the possibility of a second
term of Trump]{.underline}. Thus far, it has proven futile for Trump's
critics to seek refuge in wishful expectations that he would go away, a
wish found wanting every time it is updated. Recall that critics have
hoped Trump wouldn't win the nomination; that he would lose the
election; that he would be impeached; that he will not stand again for
office. The hope for a post-Trump return to political normality is
similarly vain. After Trump there will likely be more Trumps, given the
force of populist revolt that he has stirred, and the general
dissatisfaction with the alleged liberal world order, whose breakdown
and failures made Trumpism possible in the first place. There are good
reasons to expect Trump to be a strong contender for re-election. Since
World War II, incumbency has been a strong force in U.S. presidential
politics. It has been rare for one of the two major parties to hold the
presidency for only one term. Consider too Trump's standing. His
disapproval ratings are at historic highs, yet [he]{.underline} also
[strongly mobilizes his base]{.underline}. Donations to Trump's
re-election campaign flood in. Trump enjoys near record approval from
Republican voters, with no sign of mass defections. [As things stand, he
can campaign]{.underline} for a second term [with a]{.underline}
contentious but [powerful story: a booming economy]{.underline}, low
unemployment, a rising stock market, [strictly enforced]{.underline}
borders and [tariff walls]{.underline}, and making peace through tough
confrontation of North Korea and Iran. Each of these claims can be
unpicked. But rebutting them takes explanation. In politics, if you're
explaining, you're failing. Trump may be fortunate that his re-election
timetable coincides with the right side of an economic "boom bust"
cycle. Were he to win [a second term]{.underline}, and especially if the
margin was more decisive, the [conditions of his presidency would
change]{.underline}. If he won big, he [would have more political
capital to spend]{.underline}. He would feel vindicated by the authority
of a second mandate. Term limits would mean that he would no longer need
fear election failure. It is possible that Trump "Mark 2" would be [more
willing to tolerate the costs of introducing major change in American
grand strategy]{.underline}. Consider further the possibility of a major
strategic shock, with an impact comparable to the Wall Street Crash of
1929, the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor in 1941, or the OPEC oil
embargo of 1973. By definition, the shape and outline of the shock is
unclear. And we can't know when it would happen. But if the literature
on great power decline is sound, it would likely have military and
economic dimensions, featuring some fatal interaction of war and debt.
The source of the next financial crisis could lie elsewhere, but
[[Trump's own policies also make more likely]{.underline}]{.mark} what
was an implicit tendency, increasing the debt-deficit load and repeating
a familiar pattern, whereby a large deficit-financed military build-up,
[[deficit-financed wars (alongside tax cuts]{.underline}]{.mark})
stimulates demand, creates bubbles of irrational exuberance, [overheats
the economy]{.underline}, and eventually [leads to [a loss of confidence
in markets]{.mark}]{.underline}. This would be [followed by a
contraction]{.underline}, but this time [[without the
financial]{.underline} [reserves that were available to mitigate the
last financial crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This process could erupt
sooner rather than later]{.underline}. It would take the combination of
[[a strategic shock]{.underline}]{.mark} great enough to discredit the
status quo and a determined revisionist president. If so, then these
forces [[might come together, to take the president off the
chain]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to create a domestic environment more
hospitable to major change. Earlier security shocks, such as the 2008
financial crisis, did not lead in this direction because the Bush
administration was averse to retrenching commitments. With
[Trump]{.underline} or a Trumpian figure in the white house, one
response that was once taboo would be on the table: a [fundamental
retrenchment of overseas commitments]{.underline}, along the lines of
Trump's instincts. It isn't certain what this will involve, but it would
be drastic and imply a different assumption about how to pursue
security. [It could lead the United States to, for example, withdraw
from the Gulf and let Saudi Arabia acquire the bomb, or to acknowledge
Russia's view of its sphere of influence while withdrawing from
NATO]{.underline} or decisively repudiating Article 5, or to reduce
military expenditure just to the level needed for the United States to
deter attacks and defend itself. American "greatness" would still be
Trump's signature tune, but it would be redefined around liberating
America from foreign entanglements, investing in and walling off the
country, and an industrial renaissance. To be sure, the American foreign
policy class would fight back furiously. But like in the era of Vietnam
and the oil embargo, its power and confidence would be diminished.
Already scarred by the last global financial crisis, stagnating wages
and general alienation, the populace would be more receptive. An
emboldened and more risk-prone president would be willing to hire
outsiders as officials, less experienced and capable but ideologically
attuned to the narrower security vision of "America First." All this
might be difficult to imagine. But rapid realignments of grand strategy
can happen. As I argued, one example is Great Britain's postwar
abandonment of empire. New conditions were inhospitable to the exhausted
country maintaining its colonies. These included the cumulative fiscal
pressures of World War II, decolonization resistance, the United States'
dismantling of the economic order of imperial preference and the
sterling bloc; and the shock of the Suez crisis of 1956, which revealed
Britain's vulnerability to U.S. coercion. Successive British governments
were impelled to bow to these pressures once they became overwhelming.
They then redefined Britain's status around alliances and nuclear
weapons, presenting retreat from empire as a graceful management of
change and casting the emergence of independent countries as "the
crowning achievement of British rule." If we see a different kind of
President Trump unleashed by new conditions, less constrained and more
emboldened, in a context where major retrenchment becomes thinkable and
attractive, only then will he or his heirs probably try to bring down
the priesthood's temple. If so, as Steve Bannon suggested, the next
episode of [Trump's prime-time show will be as "wild as
shit."]{.underline}

 

#### That causes global nuclear war

Thomas H. **Henricksen 17**, emeritus senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, 3/23/17, "Post-American World
Order," <http://www.hoover.org/research/post-american-world-order>

The [tensions stoked by]{.underline} the [[assertive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square [[could
spark]{.mark} a political or military incident]{.underline} that might
set off a chain reaction leading to [a [large-scale
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, powerful rivalries nearly always
lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. The anomalous
[Cold War era spared]{.underline} the United States and Soviet Russia a
direct conflict, largely from concerns that one would trigger a [nuclear
exchange destroying]{.underline} both states and much of [the world.
Such a repetition might reoccur]{.underline} in the unfolding
three-cornered geopolitical world. It seems safe to acknowledge that an
ascendant China and a resurgent Russia will persist in their
geo-strategic ambitions. What Is To Be Done? The first marching order is
to dodge any kind of perpetual war of the sort that George Orwell
outlined in "1984," which engulfed the three super states of Eastasia,
Eurasia, and Oceania, and made possible the totalitarian Big Brother
regime. A long-running Cold War-type confrontation would almost
certainly take another form than the one that ran from 1945 until the
downfall of the Soviet Union. What prescriptions can be offered in the
face of the escalating competition among the three global powers? First,
[[by staying militarily and economically strong, the United States
will]{.underline}]{.mark} have the resources to
[[deter]{.underline}]{.mark} its peers' hawkish behavior that might
otherwise trigger a [[major conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Judging by
the history of the Cold War, [the]{.underline} coming [strategic chess
match]{.underline} with Russia and China [will prove tense]{.underline}
and demanding---[since all the countries boast nuclear arms]{.underline}
and long-range ballistic missiles. Next, the United States should widen
and sustain willing coalitions of partners, something at which America
excels, and at which China and Russia fail conspicuously. [There can be
little room for error in fraught crises among nuclear-weaponized and
hostile powers]{.underline}. Short- and long-term standoffs are likely,
as they were during the Cold War. Thus, [the playbook]{.underline}, in
part, [involves a waiting game]{.underline} in which each power looks to
its rivals to suffer grievous internal problems which could entail a
collapse, as happened to the Soviet Union.

offering a crucial point of debate for the [2018 midterm
elections](https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-expect-pre-existing-conditions-defense-will-resonate-2018).
More broadly, however, the persistence of the health care battle also
reflects the prominence of health policy in presidential races for
decades. [As a new Commonwealth Fund report
documents](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2018/jun/getting-ready-health-reform-2020-presidential),
since 1988, health care has been among the most important issues in
presidential elections. Since 1940, virtually every presidential
candidate has put his or her health care vision forward through the
party's platform (Figure 1). The contours of the 2020 health reform
platforms have already emerged. President Trump, who has indicated he
will run for reelection, included in his
[budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/budget-fy2019.pdf)
the so-called Graham--Cassidy--Heller--Johnson amendment. The proposal
would repeal federal financing for the ACA's Medicaid expansion and
Health Insurance Marketplaces, using most of the savings for a state
block grant for health care services. A revised version was introduced
by conservative think tanks this week. The Democratic contender will
likely embrace a "Medicare for More" or "Medicare for All" proposal,
expanding rather than contracting government's role in coverage.
Numerous such
[proposals](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/whats-difference-between-health-reform-proposals/)
have been introduced in the last year. That said, key questions about
the campaign plans remain, with their direction and details to be
developed in the coming months and into next year. Studies suggest that
roughly two-thirds of campaign promises have been kept by presidents in
the last five decades. [Contrary to conventional wisdom, [campaign plans
matter]{.mark}---including, and perhaps [especially, health reform
plans]{.mark}. They signal to voters the direction of each party; they
impact elections and are used to hold elected officials accountable;
and, perhaps most importantly[, they set the agenda]{.mark} for a
president and influence future policy outcomes. Studies suggest that
roughly two-thirds of campaign promises have been kept by presidents in
the last five decades. Policymakers, experts, and concerned [citizens
alike should start caring about the major health reform plans]{.mark}.
And now is the time to do so, for now is when they are being developed,
modified, and solidified. In short, now is when they most merit our
scrutiny. If past is prologue, [this work]{.mark} today [will]{.mark}
yield [better public policy on the other side of the presidential
election.]{.mark}]{.underline}

program]{.underline} for testing suspect bacteria [turned up unusual
antibiotic-resistance genes 221 times in]{.underline} 2017, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention reported. [And 11 percent of people
screened for these superbugs carried them, even though they had no
symptoms, the CDC said]{.underline}. ["CDC's study found several
dangerous [pathogens]{.mark}, hiding in plain sight, that [can cause
infections]{.mark} that are **difficult or [impossible to]{.mark}
[treat]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} said the CDC's Dr. Anne Schuchat. "While
they are appearing all over the place, an aggressive approach can snuff

### 2NC Democracy Mod

#### Dem win key to democracy

Jennifer **Rubin**, 5-16-20**18**, Opinion, Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/05/16/democrats-seek-the-key-to-beating-trump-in-2020/,
accessed 11-29-2018 {\\\\EP}

[On Tuesday, the Center for American Progress (CAP) held its annual
ideas conference. On one level, it was about rebutting the argument that
Democrats don't have an alternative to President Trump's
populist/nativist agenda. The event gave a slew of possible presidential
candidates the opportunity to get in front of prominent Democrats and
show off their rhetorical skills. The most successful of these hit on
the idea of building an agenda around a common theme.]{.underline}
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) spoke passionately about climate change,
using that as a jumping-off point to talk about high-paying jobs, the
role of governors (who took up the climate-change fight after Trump
backed out of the Paris climate agreement) and the moral obligation we
have to our children. "Climate change will no longer be on the back
burner," he vowed. For him that was the starting point to "fashion,
articulate and communicate a positive, optimistic, visionary message of
economic growth for everybody in our community." For Rep. Joe Kennedy
(D-Mass[.), it was a [heartfelt plea for access to mental-health
care]{.mark} --- in fact, all types of health care. He argued that the
means by which we get there can be debated but that [Democrats need to
take up the obligation to make sure no one falls through the
cracks]{.mark}. He bemoaned the fact that in the United States the
largest providers of mental health and addiction treatment are jails.
He, too, found a theme about which he is passionate and knowledgeable
and managed to weave in criminal-justice reform and emphasize his
party's values (e.g. inclusion, social responsibility).]{.underline}
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) fashioned himself as a wonkish reformer who
sees the United States falling behind other countries according to a
variety of indices, including economic competitiveness, high school and
college graduation rates, and investment in research and development.
Lacing his speech with stories about his father, who died six days
before Booker was elected to the Senate, he roamed around the stage with
a hand-held microphone, showing himself to be the more gregarious of the
possible 2020 contenders. [And finishing off the day, the most polished
speaker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), argued that [the country
cannot address]{.mark} issues including [climate change, education,
trade, health care, etc., without first fixing]{.mark} our "crumbling"
[democracy]{.mark}. She took on gerrymandering, voter suppression,
**[Trump]{.mark}'s effort "to [undermine the integrity of our
democracy]{.mark},"** and requiring presidents to disclose their tax
returns and remove all conflicts of interest. She honestly acknowledged
that the purpose of her Democratic Party is to win elections, starting
with state legislative and gubernatorial races. **[Only if the party
wins]{.mark}, she says, [can Democrats "help fulfill the promise of
democracy]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}"]{.underline} Finding a way to humanize
the candidate and draw listeners is apparently a substantial part of the
2020 playbook. Booker and Warren stressed their humble beginnings;
Kennedy told poignant stories of parents of children with mental
illnesses. But Democrats' bigger problem is to figure out a way not to
overwhelm voters with a blizzard of promises and programs. Finding an
organizing theme or issue, these four potential contenders showed, is
one way. Another is rooting policy ideas in expressions of values (e.g.
equality, opportunity, inclusion). It's far from clear which, if any, of
the CAP speakers will run in 2020. The winner may be the candidate who
projects earnestness and decency (a fine contrast with Trump) and can
organize his or her agenda and message around a single issue or short
list of issues. [Warren was right about one thing: [You cannot
accomplish your agenda if you don't win the
election.]{.mark}]{.underline} The corollary might be: You cannot win
elections if voters don't know you and can't figure out what you really
care about.

#### Democratic collapse is an existential threat \-\-- controls every impact

Foundation, former World Chess Champion, "Democracy and Human Rights:

https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/021617_Kasparov\_%20Testimony.pdf)

[As]{.underline} one of the [countless millions]{.underline} of people
who [were]{.underline} freed or [protected from totalitarianism by the
United States]{.underline} of America, [it is easy for me to talk about
the past]{.underline}. To talk about the belief of the American people
and their leaders that this country was exceptional, and had special
responsibilities to match its tremendous power. [That a nation founded
on freedom was bound to defend freedom everywhere]{.underline}. I could
talk about the bipartisan legacy of this most American principle, from
the Founding Fathers, to Democrats like Harry Truman, to Republicans
like Ronald Reagan. I could talk about how the American people used to
care deeply about human rights and dissidents in far-off places, and how
this is what made America a beacon of hope, a shining city on a hill.
[[America led by example and]{.mark} set a high standard, a standard
that [exposed]{.mark} the hypocrisy and cruelty of
[dictatorships]{.mark} around the world. But there is no time for
nostalgia]{.underline}. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse
of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War,
[[Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}, and America, [[have retreated]{.mark}
from those principles, and **[the world has become much worse
off]{.mark} as a result**]{.underline}. American skepticism about
America's role in the world deepened in the long, painful wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, and their aftermaths. Instead of applying the
lessons learned about how to do better, lessons about faulty
intelligence and working with native populations, the main outcome was
to stop trying. This result has been a tragedy for the billions of
people still living under authoritarian regimes around the world, and it
is based on faulty analysis. You can never guarantee a positive
outcome--- not in chess, not in war, and certainly not in politics. The
best you can do is to do what you know is right and to try your best. I
speak from experience when I say that the citizens of unfree states do
not expect guarantees. They want a reason to hope and a fighting chance.
[People living under dictatorships want the opportunity for
freedom]{.underline}, the opportunity to live in peace and to follow
their dreams. From the Iraq War to the Arab Spring to the current
battles for liberty from Venezuela to Eastern Ukraine, people are
fighting for that opportunity, giving up their lives for freedom. [The
United States must not abandon them. The United States and the rest of
the free world has an unprecedented advantage in economic and military
strength today. What is lacking is the will.]{.underline} The will to
make the case to the American people, [the will to take risks and invest
in the long-term security of the country, and the world]{.underline}.
This will require investments in aid, in education, in security that
allow countries to attain the stability their people so badly need. Such
investment is far more moral and far cheaper than the cycle of
[**[terror, war]{.mark}**, refugees, [and]{.mark} **military
i[ntervention]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[results when America leaves
a vacuum]{.mark} of power.]{.underline} The best way to help refugees is
to prevent them from becoming refugees in the first place. The Soviet
Union was an existential threat, and this focused the attention of the
world, and the American people. There [**[existential threat]{.mark}**
today is not found on a map, but it **[is very
real]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [forces of the past are making steady
progress against the modern world order. **[Terrorist]{.mark}**
movements in the Middle East, [extremist parties]{.mark} across Europe,
a paranoid tyrant in **[North Korea]{.mark} threatening [nuclear
blackmail,]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}, at the center of the
web, [an **[aggressive]{.mark} KGB dictator in
[Russia]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} They all want to turn the world back to a
dark past because their survival is threatened by]{.underline} the
[values of the free world, epitomized by the United States. And **they
[are thriving as the U.S. has retreated]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
global freedom index has declined for ten consecutive years. No one like
to talk about the United States as a global policeman, but [**this is
what happens when there is no cop on the beat. [American leadership
begins at home]{.mark}**, right here. America cannot lead the world on
democracy and human rights if there is no unity on]{.underline} the
[meaning and importance of these things. []{.mark}**Leadership is
required to make that case clearly and powerfully**. Right now,
Americans are engaged in politics at a level not seen in decades. It is
an opportunity for them to rediscover that making America great begins
with believing America can be great.]{.underline} The Cold War was won
on American values that were shared by both parties and nearly every
American. Institutions that were created by a Democrat, Truman, were
triumphant forty years later thanks to the courage of a Republican,
Reagan. This bipartisan consistency created the decades of strategic
[stability]{.underline} that [is the great strength of democracies.
Strong institutions that outlast politicians allow for long-range
planning]{.underline}. In contrast, dictators can operate only
tactically, not strategically, because they are not constrained by the
balance of powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own survival.
This is why a dictator like Putin has an advantage in chaos, the ability
to move quickly. This can only be met by strategy, by long-term goals
that are based on shared values, not on polls and cable news. The fear
of making things worse has paralyzed the United States from trying to
make things better. There will always be setbacks, but the United States
cannot quit. [The spread of **[democracy is the only]{.mark}** proven
**[remedy for]{.mark}** nearly [**every crisis that plagues the world
today. War, famine, poverty, terrorism**--all are generated]{.mark} and
exacerbated [by authoritarian regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. A policy of
[America First inevitably puts American security last. **[American
leadership is required because there is no one
else]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and because it is good for America. [There
is no weapon or wall that is more powerful for security than America
being envied, imitated, and admired around the world. Admired not for
being perfect, but for having the exceptional courage to always try to
be better]{.underline}. Thank you.

### Turns Case - War

#### Warming causes extinction, outweighs nuclear war, and increases the propensity for violent conflict 

**McKibben, 16**---Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College
(Bill, "We're under attack from climate change---and our only hope is to
mobilize like we did in WWII,"
<https://newrepublic.com/article/135684/declare-war-climate-change-mobilize-wwii>)

In the North this summer, a devastating offensive is underway. Enemy
forces have seized huge swaths of territory; [with [each]{.mark} passing
[week]{.mark}, another [**22,000 square miles** of Arctic ice
disappears]{.mark}]{.underline}. Experts dispatched to the battlefield
in July saw little cause for hope, especially since this siege is one of
the oldest fronts in the war. "In 30 years, [[the area has
shrunk]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately [[by
**half**]{.underline}]{.mark}," said a scientist who examined the
onslaught. "There doesn't seem anything able to stop this." In the
Pacific this spring, the enemy staged a daring breakout across thousands
of miles of ocean, waging a full-scale assault on the region's [[coral
reefs]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In a matter of **months**,]{.underline}
long stretches of formations like the Great Barrier Reef---dating back
past the start of human civilization and visible from space---[[were
reduced to **white bone-yards**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Day after day,
week after week, saboteurs behind our lines are unleashing a series of
brilliant and overwhelming attacks. In the past few months alone, [[our
foes have used]{.underline}]{.mark} a firestorm to force the total
evacuation of a city of 90,000 in Canada, [[**drought** to ravage
crops]{.underline}]{.mark} to the point where southern Africans are
literally eating their seed corn, and floods to threaten the priceless
repository of art in the Louvre. The enemy is even deploying
**[[bio]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** to spread
psychological terror: The Zika virus, loaded like a bomb into a growing
army of mosquitoes, has shrunk the heads of newborn babies across an
entire continent; panicked health ministers in seven countries are now
urging women not to get pregnant. And as in all conflicts, [[**millions
of refugees** are fleeing]{.underline}]{.mark} the horrors of war,
[their numbers **swelling daily**]{.underline} as they're forced to
abandon their homes to escape famine and desolation and disease.
[[**World War III** is]{.underline}]{.mark} well and truly
[[underway]{.underline}]{.mark}. And we are losing. For years, our
leaders chose to ignore the warnings of our best scientists and top
military strategists. [Global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}, they told
us, was beginning a stealth campaign that [[would lay waste
to]{.underline}]{.mark} vast stretches of **[[the
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, uprooting and killing millions of
innocent civilians. But instead of paying heed and taking obvious
precautions, we chose to strengthen the enemy with our endless
[combustion]{.underline}; a billion explosions of a billion pistons
inside a billion cylinders [have fueled a global threat **[as lethal
as]{.mark}**]{.underline} the mushroom-shaped **[[nuclear
explosions]{.underline}]{.mark}** we long feared. [[Carbon and
methane]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[represent the **deadliest enemy of
all time**, the first force **fully capable** of]{.underline}
[harrying]{.underline}]{.mark}, scattering, and impoverishing [[our
**entire civilization**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We're used to war as
metaphor: the war on poverty, the war on drugs, the war on cancer.
Usually this is just a rhetorical device, a way of saying, "We need to
focus our attention and marshal our forces to fix something we don't
like." But this is no metaphor. [By most of the ways we measure wars,
climate change is the **real deal**: Carbon and methane are [**seizing
physical territory**, **sowing havoc**]{.mark} and **panic**, [racking
up **casualties**, and even **destabilizing
governments**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Over the past few years,
record-setting droughts have helped undermine the brutal strongman of
Syria and fuel the rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria.) It's not that global
warming is like a world war. It is a world war. Its first victims,
ironically, are those who have done the least to cause the crisis. But
[[it's a world war **aimed at us all**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And if we
lose, we will be as decimated and helpless as the losers in every
conflict\--except that this time, [there will be **no winners**, and no
end to the planetwide occupation that follows]{.underline}.

5\. [Winning In [2020 Is **More Important** Than]{.mark} Winning In
[2016]{.mark}]{.underline} No one wishes for the global economy to
crumble or for the world to be embroiled in deadly international crises.
But it's not that hard to imagine a Trump presidency going off the rails
without any Democratic assistance. And that would cause enormous
political consequences. [[If Trump manages to **drag down the
entire**]{.mark} **Republican [Party]{.mark}** [with him]{.mark} over
the next four years, [Democrats might]{.mark} be able to [snag the
**biggest**]{.mark} **political [prize of all]{.mark}** in the 2020
elections: majority [control of state]{.mark} legislative
[chambers]{.mark} --- just [in time for]{.mark} the congressional
**[redistricting]{.mark}** process [that will follow the]{.mark} 2020
[Census. That would give Democrats]{.mark} the [ability to

**undo**]{.mark} **Republican [gerrymandering]{.mark} efforts**
[that]{.mark} have [delivered the GOP a]{.mark} House [majority]{.mark}
even while Democratic House candidates nationally earn more votes. [If a
**Trump-fueled**]{.mark} **GOP [collapse]{.mark}** [leads to **full
control** of]{.mark} the federal executive and legislative [branches, a
**lasting**]{.mark} **Democratic [realignment]{.mark}** [may]{.mark}
still [be upon us]{.mark}]{.underline}. None of that should make
liberals sanguine about the potential for lunatic Supreme Court
appointments, a freeze on crucial efforts to arrest global warming, a
cruel immigration crackdown, a rise in "alt-right"-fueled racism and
sexism, as well as other unforeseen horrors. But [[with
unity]{.underline}]{.mark} of purpose, strategic smarts and tenacious
organizing, [the damage of a Trump presidency can be mitigated, and the
[Democratic]{.mark} Party's political [fortunes may **rapidly
turn**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Trump 2020 victory locks in conservative Supreme Court majority, turns the case and undermines progressive regulations broadly

Democratic Societies. May **2019**, Trump's Second Term,\" Atlantic,
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/trump-2020-second-term/585994

Finally, [a [second term for Trump would **entrench changes at
home**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} [perhaps the most durable of which
involves the Supreme Court]{.underline}. **[With a full eight years, [he
would]{.mark} probably have the opportunity to [replace two more
justices]{.mark}]{.underline}**: Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be 87 at the
beginning of the next presidential term, and Stephen Breyer will be 82.
Whether you regard the prospect of four Trump-appointed justices as a
good or a bad thing will depend on your politics and preferences---but
**[there is no denying that the impact on the nation's highest court
would be momentous.]{.underline}**

Not since Richard Nixon has a president named four new Supreme Court
justices, and not since Franklin D. Roosevelt has one had the
opportunity to alter the Court's ideological balance so decisively. In
Nixon's time, conservatives did not approach court vacancies with a
clear conception of their judicial objectives or with carefully vetted
candidates; both Nixon and Gerald Ford appointed justices who ended up
on the Court's liberal wing. Since then, however, the conservative
movement has built a formidable legal network designed to ensure that
future judicial vacancies would not be squandered.

[The justices nominated by recent Republican presidents reflect this
shift]{.underline}. [But because the Court's conservative majorities
have remained slim,]{.underline} a series of Republican
appointees---Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and most recently
John Roberts---have, by occasionally breaking ranks, held the Court back
from a full-scale reversal of liberal principles and precedents.
**[[With a 7--2]{.mark} rather than a 5--4 [majority]{.mark}, however,
[the Court's conservatives could no longer be checked]{.mark} by a lone
swing vote.]{.underline}**

[Much of the public discussion about [the Court's future focuses
on]{.mark} Roe v. Wade and other decisions expanding [rights]{.mark},
protecting [free speech, or]{.mark} mandating separa[tion of Church and
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Much less public attention has been paid to
[conservative activists']{.mark} interest in [reversing
precedents]{.mark} [that]{.mark} since the New Deal era [have enabled
the federal government to **regulate labor and the
economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [In the late 19th and early
20th centuries, conservative justices regularly struck down laws and
regulations such as limits on work hour]{.underline}s. Only in 1937,
after ruling major New Deal programs unconstitutional, did the Court
uphold a state minimum-wage law. In the decades that followed, the Court
invoked the Constitution's commerce clause, which authorizes Congress to
regulate interstate commerce, as the basis for upholding laws regulating
virtually any activity affecting the economy. A great deal of federal
law, from labor standards to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to health and
environmental regulation, rests on that foundation.

[But [the Court's conservative majority]{.mark} [has]{.mark} recently
[been chipping away at]{.mark} the expansive interpretation of the
commerce clause, and some jurists on the right want to return to the
pre-1937 era, thereby sharply **limiting [the government's regulatory
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2012, the Court's five conservative
justices held that the Affordable Care Act's penalty for failing to
obtain insurance---the so-called individual mandate---was not justified
by the commerce clause. In a sweeping dissent from the majority's
opinion, four of those justices voted to strike down the entire ACA for
that reason. The law survived only because the fifth conservative, Chief
Justice Roberts, held that the mandate was a constitutional exercise of
the government's taxing power.

[[If the Court had included seven conservative justices]{.mark} in 2012,
it [would almost **certainly have declared the ACA null and
void.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**This is the fate awaiting much existing
social and economic legislation and regulation if Trump is
reelected**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [And that's to say nothing of future
legislation such as measures to limit climate change, which might well
be struck down by a Court adhering to an originalist interpretation of
our 18th-century Constitution]{.underline}.

[[Democracy]{.mark} is always a gamble, but ordinarily the stakes
involve short-term wins and losses. **Much more [hangs in the
balance]{.mark} next year**]{.underline}.

[With a second term]{.underline}, [**Trump's presidency would go from an
aberration to a turning point in American histor**y]{.underline}. But it
would not usher in an era marked by stability. The effects of climate
change and the risks associated with another nuclear arms race are bound
to be convulsive. And Trump's reelection would leave the country
contending with both dangers under the worst possible conditions, deeply
alienated from friends abroad and deeply divided at home. [The Supreme
Court, furthermore, would be far out of line with public opinion and at
the center of political conflict, much as the Court was in the 1930s
before it relented on the key policies of the New Deal.]{.underline}

News, October 16, 2007.
\<http://news.mongabay.com/2007/1016-climate.html)

[[Climate change will have a significant economic impact on the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, reports a new
study published by researchers from the University of Maryland. The
report, The U.S. Economic Impacts of Climate Change and the Costs of
Inaction, aggregates and analyzes previous economic research in order to
develop a better estimate of the costs of climate change. \"[[The range
of climatic changes anticipated in the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates --- from rising sea levels to stronger and
more frequent storms and extreme temperature events --- [[will have real
impacts on the]{.underline}]{.mark} natural environment as well as
human-made infrastructure and their [[ability to contribute to economic
activity and quality of life]{.underline}]{.mark},\" write the authors.
\"These impacts will vary across regions and sectors of the economy,
leaving future governments, the private sector and citizens to face the
full spectrum of direct and indirect costs accrued from increasing
environmental damage and disruption.\" The authors say there has been
limited research on the long-term costs of addressing [[the economic
impacts of climate change on the agricultural, manufacturing and public
service sectors]{.underline}]{.mark}. They argue that inaction
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} steeply [[increase the cost of
adaptation.]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[[Climate change will affect every
American economically in significant, dramatic
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the longer it takes to respond, the
greater the damage and the higher the costs,\" said lead researcher
Matthias Ruth, director of the University of Maryland\'s Center for
Integrative Environmental Research. \"The national debate is often
framed in terms of how much it will cost to reduce greenhouse gases,
with little or no consideration of the cost of no response or the cost
of waiting. Review and analysis of existing data suggest that delay will
prove costly and tip the economic scales in favor of quicker strategic
action.\" The report concludes: Economic impacts of climate change will
occur throughout the country. Economic impacts will be unevenly

#### Turn the heg

**Matthew 8** -- University of California, Irvine \[Richard A., "Global
Climate Change National Security Implications," May,
<http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB862.pdf>\]

Against this background, [[climate change and security can be linked in
a number of ways]{.underline}]{.mark}. Where climate changes abruptly,
security problems will be immediate and extensive and perhaps even
existential. [[We can easily envision threats on this scale in
Bangladesh or other poor low-lying countries, but even here a
significant number of Americans would be affected by a sudden barrage of
massive flooding, Katrina-sized hurricanes, and tropical disease
epidemics**---**]{.underline}]{.mark}perhaps enough to make climate
change a national security issue. [[Another possible threat that we
should take seriously is that of the gradual erosion of American power
as endless demands are placed on it due to abrupt changes
elsewhere.]{.mark}]{.underline} These are likely to arise as we face
humanitarian disasters, as drought intensifies throughout Africa, and as
South Asia collapses into conflict over things like fresh water. The
greater our sense of interdependence, the greater our sense that
national security depends on the welfare of things beyond our borders,
and the more likely it is that the climate change will be a real
security threat. This poses a big problem today

#### Warming turns hegemony---Climate change military overstretch

**AP 2009**---Fox News, August 9, 2009, "Report: Climate Change Could
Warrant U.S. Military Action.,"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2009/08/09/report-climate-change-warrant-military-action

[[Climate change will pose]{.underline}]{.mark} profound [[challenges to
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates in the coming decades, [[raising the
prospect of military intervention]{.mark} to deal with its
effects]{.underline}, The New York Times reported, citing military and
intelligence analysts. [[Crises such as drought,]{.mark} violent
[storms,]{.mark} mass [migration and pandemics could topple governments,
feed terrorist movements or destabilize]{.mark} entire
[regions.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Times reported that for the first
time, [[intelligence agencies and the Pentagon are taking
a]{.underline}]{.mark} hard [[look at]{.underline}]{.mark} the possible
[[security implications]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting from climate
change. In particular, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South and
Southeast Asia, will face the prospect of food shortages, water
[[crises]{.underline}]{.mark} and catastrophic flooding driven by
climate change that [[could call for U.S. military
response.]{.underline}]{.mark} The [[U.S. military]{.underline}]{.mark}
also faces a direct challenge with climate change, the Times reported,
because many of its [[installations are vulnerable to storm surges and
rising seas]{.underline}]{.mark} and plans to protect naval stations in
Norfolk, Va., and San Diego, Calif., are already underway. \"The sense
that climate change poses security and geopolitical challenges is
central to the thinking of the State Department and the climate
office,\" said Peter Ogden, chief of staff to Todd Stern, the State
Department\'s top climate negotiator. A U.S. government study of
glaciers released Thursday said climate change is melting America\'s
glaciers at the fastest rate in recorded history, exposing the country
to higher risks of drought and rising sea levels. \"The observations
show that the melt rate has definitely increased over the past 10 or 15
years,\" Ed Josberger, a USGS scientist, said. \"This certainly is a
very strong indicator that climate change is occurring and its effects
on glaciers are virtually worldwide.\"

#### Global warming threatens US oil production

**Reuters** 20**07**--- ("Global warming could threaten U.S. oil
output." October 18, 2007.
\<http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSN1836566920071018\>)

Global [[warming]{.mark} may [produce stronger hurricanes that]{.mark}
could [disrupt U.S. oil]{.mark} production]{.underline} in the Gulf of
Mexico and damage ports and pipelines along the coast that move fuel
supplies, a new government report said on Thursday. The report from a
team of climate change experts and scientists at seven Energy Department
laboratories is the first to provide details on the impact global
warming could have on the U.S. energy sector. The report warns of more
strong storms like [hurricanes [Katrina and Rita]{.mark}]{.underline} in
2005 that [[destroy]{.underline}ed]{.mark} over [[100 offshore
production platforms and damaged]{.mark} almost 600
[pipelines]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result, [a large chunk of [U.S.
**oil and natural gas** production was shut in for
months]{.mark},]{.underline} onshore pipelines were unable to transport
gasoline supplies to major cities and pump prices hit record highs
across the country. \"Increases in storm intensity could threaten
further (energy supply) disruptions of the sorts experienced in 2005,\"
the report said.

The rationale driving the shift to nuclear energy in the first place
(energy and [**[climate stress]{.underline}**)
[will]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[translate

[Politically, this may translate into]{.underline} [changes in the

### Turns Case\-\--Climate\-\--Trade

#### Climate change will cause protectionist carbon tariffs that spark trade war

**Talley and Barkley 2009**---Ian Talley and Tom Barkley, March 18,
2009, Wall Street Journal, "Energy Chief Says U.S. Is Open to Carbon
Tariff," http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123733297926563315.html

Mr. Chu, speaking before a House science panel, said [[establishing a
carbon tariff would help \"level the playing field\" if other countries
haven\'t imposed greenhouse-gas-reduction mandates similar to the
one]{.underline}]{.mark} President Barack [[Obama plans to
implement]{.underline}]{.mark} over the next couple of years. It is the
first time the Obama administration has made public its view on the
issue. \"[[If other countries don\'t impose a cost on carbon, then we
will be at a disadvantage\...\[and\] we would look at
considering]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[duties that would offset that
cost]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Mr. Chu said. Li
[[Gao]{.underline}]{.mark}, a senior Chinese negotiator from the
National Development and Reform Commission, [[told]{.underline}]{.mark}
Dow Jones Newswires Monday [[that a carbon tariff would be a
\"disaster,\" would prompt a trade war and wouldn\'t be legal
under]{.underline}]{.mark} [[W]{.underline}]{.mark}orld
[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}rade [[O]{.underline}]{.mark}rganization
[[agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} \"It does not abide by the rule of
\[the\] WTO and, secondly, it\'s not fair,\" Mr. Gao said, adding that
his delegation would relate China\'s concerns to U.S. officials. Mr.
Chu\'s comments came amid other signs of concern among U.S. trading
partners about protectionist rhetoric and legislation from Washington.
On Monday, Mexico announced it would put tariffs on \$2.4 billion of
U.S. goods in retaliation for a measure to limit the access of Mexican
truckers to U.S. roads. \"Buy American\" provisions tied to the recent
stimulus package have prompted concerns from some U.S. trading partners,
and trade issues are expected to be prominent on the agenda at meetings
next month among leaders of the Group of 20 leading nations.

#### The US would levy a tariff to prevent companies from going to places without carbon regulations

**Loris 2009**---Nicolas Loris, Research Associate at The Heritage
Foundation, March 2009, "Protectionism in the Name of Global Warming
Regulations,"
http://blog.heritage.org/2009/03/19/protectionism-in-the-name-of-global-warming-regulations/

[[Protectionism is always bad policy.]{.underline}]{.mark} But
protectionism during an economic downturn, after taxes have already
risen, and in addition to a massive \$2 trillion tax on energy
consumption is, well, not good. Yet [[that is]{.underline}]{.mark}
exactly [[what Energy Secretary]{.underline}]{.mark} David [[Chu seems
to be edging towards. In response to the notion that American companies
will move overseas when CO2 is capped]{.underline}]{.mark}, Secretary
[[Chu suggested that the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[levy a
carbon tariff on imports.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is why Secretaries
of Energy should stick with energy and not economic policy. This is why
free-markets work and command and control economies do not. At any rate,
the supposed logic goes something like this. Since energy, predominately
fossil fuel, is the lifeblood our economy, industries across the board
will be hit with higher energy costs. Particularly hit hard will be the
manufacturing sector. In the first 20 years, the Lieberman-Warner cap
and trade bill would have destroyed over 900,000 jobs, caused nearly 3
million job losses in the manufacturing sector by 2029, caused some
manufacturing sectors (e.g., paper, chemicals, and plastics).

### Turns Case\-\--Climate\-\--Terror

#### Climate change causes ISIS rise and further conflict

**Think Progress 15**\-\--("The link between climate change and ISIS is
real," July 23, 2015,
https://thinkprogress.org/the-link-between-climate-change-and-isis-is-real-399789412b41#.5gsutmwvp)
Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley linked climate change
to the rise of ISIS earlier this week.
[Conservatives](http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/07/20/martin-omalley-climate-change-created-isis/)
[pounced](http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/20/omalley-global-warming-created-isis/).
Score this round for O'Malley.

For three years now, [leading security and [climate
experts]{.mark} --- and Syrians themselves --- have [made the connection
between climate change and the Syrian civil war.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}Indeed, when a [major peer-reviewed
study](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241.abstract) came out on in
March making this very case, Retired Navy Rear Admiral David Titley
[said](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/03/02/study_climate_change_helped_spark_syrian_civil_war.html)
it identifies "a pretty convincing climate fingerprint" for the Syrian
drought. Titley, a meteorologist who led the U.S. Navy's Task Force on
Climate Change when he was at the Pentagon, also said, "[[you can draw a
very credible climate connection to this disaster we call ISIS right
now."]{.underline}]{.mark} Compare the words of Admiral
Titley --- former Deputy Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for
Information Dominance (!) and currently Director of Penn State's [Center
for Solutions to Weather and Climate
Risks](http://solutions2wxrisk.psu.edu/). --- with O'Malley's ([video
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKfYq24eWGg)): ["One of the things
that preceded]{.underline} the failure of the nation-state of Syria and
[[the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}
and the mega-drought [that]{.underline} affected that region, [[wiped
out farmers]{.mark}, [drove people to cities]{.mark}, [created a
humanitarian crisis that created the symptoms]{.mark} --- or rather, the
conditions --- [of extreme poverty that has led now to the rise of
ISIL]{.mark}]{.underline} and this extreme violence." Let's run through
the science underpinning what O'Malley, Admiral Titley, and others have
said. We know that the Syrian civil war that helped drive the rise of
the terrorist Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) was itself
spawned in large part by what [one
expert](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2012/03/03/437051/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/)
called perhaps "the worst long-term drought and most severe set of crop
failures since agricultural civilizations began in the Fertile
Crescent," from 2006 to 2010. That drought destroyed the livelihood of
800,000 people according to the U.N. and sent vastly more into poverty.
The poor and displaced fled to cities, "where poverty, government
mismanagement and other factors created unrest that exploded in spring
2011," as the study's [news
release](http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2015/015046/perfect-storm) explains.
The [March 2015
study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/02/23/1421533112),
"Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent
Syrian drought," found that [[global warming made Syria's 2006 to 2010
drought two to three times more likely.]{.mark} "]{.underline}While
we're not saying the drought caused the war," lead author Dr. Colin
Kelley explained. "We are saying that it certainly contributed to other
factors --- agricultural collapse and mass migration among them --- that
caused the uprising." [The study identifies "a pretty convincing climate
fingerprint]{.underline}" for the Syrian drought, Admiral Titley told
[Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/03/02/study_climate_change_helped_spark_syrian_civil_war.html)
at the time. Titley is the former COO of NOAA. In particular, the study
finds that [climate change is already drying the region]{.underline} out
in two ways: "First, weakening wind patterns that bring rain-laden air
from the Mediterranean reduced precipitation during the usual
November-to-April wet season. In addition, higher temperatures increased
moisture evaporation from soils during the usually hot summers." [This
study and others make clear that for large parts of the
not-terribly-stable region around Syria --- including Lebanon, Israel,
Jordan, and parts of Turkey and Iraq --- [brutal multi-year droughts are
poised to become the norm in the coming decades if we don't reverse
carbon pollution trends ASAP. ]{.mark}]{.underline}Climate models had
long predicted that the countries surrounding the Mediterranean would
start drying out. In general, climate science says dry areas will get
dryer and wet areas wetter. In 2011, a major NOAA study
[concluded](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/10/27/355639/noaa-climate-change-mediterranean-droughts/)
that "human-caused climate change \[is now\] a major factor in more
frequent Mediterranean droughts." Reds and oranges highlight lands
around the Mediterranean that experienced significantly drier winters
during 1971--2010 than the comparison period of 1902--2010. Via NOAA
\[Click to enlarge\]. "The magnitude and frequency of the drying that
has occurred is too great to be explained by natural variability alone,"
explained Dr. Martin Hoerling of NOAA's Earth System Research
Laboratory, the lead author of the 2011 study. [The connection between
the conflict in Syria and climate change is not new]{.underline}. In
March 2012, Climate Progress
[published](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/03/03/437051/syria-climate-change-drought-social-unrest/)
a piece by Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell, co-founders and
directors of the Center for Climate and Security, which made the case
for the link between climate change and events in Syria. In 2013, Tom
Friedman went to Syria to learn firsthand about the connection between
the drought and the civil war. His New York Times column, "[Without
Water,
Revolution](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/opinion/sunday/friedman-without-water-revolution.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0),"
explains what he discovered. Friedman also filmed his visit, where he
talked to actual Syrians about the causes of the civil war. It was for
the premiere episode in April 2014 of the Emmy-winning Showtime series,
"[Years of Living Dangerously](http://yearsoflivingdangerously.com/),"
which can be viewed on Netflix [right
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brvhCnYvxQQ). Many other recent
studies have been done on this subject, such as "[Water, Drought,
Climate Change, and Conflict in
Syria](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/WCAS-D-13-00059.1?journalCode=wcas)"
by climate and water expert Peter Gleick. Perhaps [[the central
takeaway]{.underline}]{.mark} from this area of research [is that **[the
greatest danger to humanity this century from human-caused climate
change is
[Dust-Bowlification](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/10/02/3572205/warming-dust-bowlify/)
and the threat to our food supplies and hence global security.
]{.mark}**]{.underline}That's because [large parts of the most inhabited
and arable parts of the planet --- including the U.S.
breadbasket --- face the exact same heating and drying that have already
affected the Mediterranean]{.underline}. The 2014 study, "[Global
warming and 21st century
drying](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~bc9z/cook_pdsi_clidyn_REV_v01.pdf),"
projected this bleak future: The bottom line: Homo sapiens is currently
on track to make drought and extreme drying the normal condition for the
Southwest, Central Plains, the Amazon, southern Europe, the entire
region around the Mediterranean, and many other key areas post-2050. As
Femia bluntly told an interviewer in 2013, the time to act is now: "[if
you let this problem get out of hand you're going to have a number of
situations in the future, whether they're major disasters or conflicts,
that our security forces may have to respond to. [It will cost us a lot
more in the long term if we do nothing now."]{.mark}]{.underline}
Returning to O'Malley's comments, it's pretty clear that they are quite
reasonable and defensible. Personally, because the causes of war and
terrorism are so complicated and interconnected, I prefer to say things
like "climate change HELPED create conditions for rise of ISIS." Not
that nuanced phrasing will not spare anyone the attacks from the
anti-science crowd.

### Uniqueness

#### Trump will win -- incumbency benefit and attention focus

[PETER **NICHOLAS**](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/peter-nicholas/)
9:40 AM **June 28 2019** It's Still the Trump Show Donald Trump wasn't
onstage during the first Democratic debates, but he might as well have
been. ET
<https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/trump-2020-debates/592927/>

Former Vice President Joe Biden called President Donald Trump a tool of
Wall Street who has "ripped" out the nation's soul. The author Marianne
Williamson accused Trump of exploiting people's fears. Senator Bernie
Sanders of Vermont cast Trump as a "pathological liar" and a "racist."
[[Trump might as well have been gripping a podium of his own last night,
so prominently did he figure into the two-hour Democratic
debate]{.underline}]{.mark} in Miami. And if a spot onstage had been
offered to him, you had a sense he might have grabbed it. Trump was
nearly 8,000 miles away from the 2020 Democrats invoking his name,
starting a whirlwind day of meetings with foreign leaders in Osaka,
Japan. But the scene in Miami was much on his mind. Between meetings
with German and Indian leaders, the president made time to tweet about
the 10-person debate and later told reporters he had caught a snippet of
it on television. Standing beside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump
mentioned the previous night's debate with 10 candidates, saying, "It
wasn't very exciting." Merkel didn't play along. Listening to Trump's
foray into partisan domestic politics, the German leader stood
"stoned-faced," a pool reporter wrote[[. If these first two debates
showed anything, though, it's how tough it will be for Democratic
candidates to compete with Trump for]{.underline}]{.mark} [[attention.
Incumbency gives any president an advantage---even more so in Trump's
case.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[He's shown he can commandeer news cycles
through unexpected policy pronouncements that move markets and rattle
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Democratic candidates who stay focused
on the finer points of U.S. industrial policy risk getting drowned

around the clock. "BORING!" Trump tweeted from Air Force One while

Democrats Still Favored to Win in 2020, But Odds Are Slipping
<https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/news/politics/democrats-still-favored-win-2020-odds-slipping/>

[[For Donald Trump and the Republicans, everything is going to come down
to the economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. He's not an eloquent President --
if anything, he rubs many people the wrong way -- and he's definitely
made the foreign situation with America's allies quite challenging. At
the same time, [[history shows that the voters will stick with the
incumbent if the economy is strong]{.underline}]{.mark}. The prospect of
switching to someone like Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could have a
sizable impact on the economy and voters will be worried about that.
What's the Best Bet? [[With unemployment is really
low]{.underline}]{.mark}, African American unemployment at all-time
lows, [[and the economy pumping -- even with all sorts of tariffs --
it'll be hard for the Democratic Party to win if the economy is going
well. I'd bet Trump to return to office for four more
years]{.underline}]{.mark} as of right now.

#### Trump will win -- huge base momentum, support for ideals, and a strong economy

**[Dave Ball](https://www.americanthinker.com/author/dave_ball/) June
27, 2019** Why President Trump wins in 2020
<https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2019/06/why_president_trump_wins_in_2020.html>

President [[Trump will be re-elected in 2020. Here\'s
why]{.underline}]{.mark}. America is great because President Trump has
been doing what he promised to do during the 2016 campaign. It is great
because President [[Trump has captured the attention and enthusiasm of a
large and diverse base. The constant obstruction he has faced only
energizes his base more]{.underline}]{.mark}. A lot of Americans again
care about America. On Tuesday, June 18, President Trump formally
confirmed what we all knew: he is running for re-election as president
of the United States. He made his re-election announcement in front of
20,000 exuberant supporters in a packed Orlando, Florida arena. There
were that many or more supporters outside as well, and 120,000 people
had requested tickets for the event. In addition to the energy of the
crowd, observers reported that it contained more women and Hispanics
than previous crowds. That\'s an ominous sign for the Democrats. The
president\'s campaign theme this year is \"Keep America Great.\" [[The
president\'s policies are working. Lower taxes have a positive effect on
the economy. When the economy grows, jobs are created, unemployment
falls, and people live better]{.underline}]{.mark}. Reason tells us that
creating a positive environment for business will result in thriving
business. This means minimal government regulation. For business to grow
does not require intervention from the government; it does not require
huge market-distorting subsidies; it is not helped by the government
forcing social policy on business. It does not require that the
government tell people how to spend or invest their money. It simply
requires the government to stay out of the way. The free market works.
Providing opportunity to people is far superior to subsidies for growing
the market. This was the president\'s platform in 2016. It is working,
and his 2020 platform will be to continue building and defending this
nation and its people, keeping America great. [[The enthusiasm for
Trump\'s America has not subsided]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The Democratic
Party, on the other hand, continues to drift farther
left]{.underline}]{.mark}. The 25 currently announced candidates appear
to be in a competition to show themselves as more liberal than the rest.
The general theme is that everything Trump has done is wrong and must be
reversed immediately. They are saying to the American people, We want to
take away your successful and growing economy; we want to open our
borders and flood the nation with illegal aliens; we want to eliminate
your jobs, depress wages, and increase unemployment; we want to drive
business out of this country and back overseas; and we want to increase
your taxes dramatically. How do the American people benefit from that?
The Democratic National Convention will be held in July 2020. In the
year between now and then, it\'s safe to say the current candidate
stampede will see attrition. In the end, the Democrats will place before
the American people a candidate and a platform that promise a lot of
free stuff that really isn\'t free, big government control over people
and business, massive uncontrolled immigration, oppressive regulation
and high taxes. That is not exciting, particularly when fewer and fewer
people require all the freebies because they are now working. [[Next
November\'s election will be not the popularity contest the Democrats
hope for]{.underline}]{.mark}, but rather a statement by the American
people as to whether they want to continue to enjoy prosperity and
security or if they wish to give that up in favor of a return to failed,
smothering government control. In today\'s world, there are many
common-sense Democrats whose values do not align with their party of
registration. They, along with many independents and Republicans,
understand the importance of a free-market economy, low taxes,
individual effort, and minimal government interference. Conventional
wisdom says elections are all about the economy. As demonstrated in
[this
article](https://www.thoughtco.com/presidential-elections-and-the-economy-1146241),
that may not always be entirely true. An improving economy at election
time appears to be a positive influence but not a determinate one. What
is occurring in the world and elsewhere in the country is also
significant, as is the product the opponent is trying to sell. [[The
economy will play a role in this election, but so will an inferior
Democratic candidate]{.underline}]{.mark}, which appears inevitable,
[[and a Democratic platform that is distasteful to many Americans of
both parties]{.underline}]{.mark}. Add to this the reality that many
Americans are sick of the distortion by the media that becomes more
obvious each day. [[Americans]{.underline}]{.mark} are sick of the
falsehoods attached to the Mueller investigation, they are sick of
threats to their livelihood by unelected bureaucrats through regulation,
and [[they appreciate that Trump takes on the bad
guys.]{.mark}]{.underline} These people believe that America is a great
nation. [[If the enthusiasm of the Republican base so far and the
\"return to failure\" character of the Democratic platform, coupled with
the unattractiveness of the possible candidates, are any indication,
President Trump will win four more years]{.underline}]{.mark}.

President Donald [[Trump has raised \$36 million since he announced his
2020 reelection campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} a week ago. From
[CNBC](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/735852558/democratic-presidential-debate-see-the-20-candidates-who-will-be-onstage):
[[Trump's seven-day haul is double the entire first-quarter fundraising
total for]{.mark}]{.underline} Sen. Bernie
[[Sanders]{.underline}]{.mark} of Vermont , [[whose \$18 million led the
field of two dozen Democratic presidential
hopefuls]{.underline}]{.mark}. At a donor event on Tuesday at the Trump
International Hotel in Washington, the president raised \$6 million with
225 people in attendance in support of his joint fundraising committee,
according to Republican officials with direct knowledge of the matter.
The committee, called Trump Victory, distributes donations between the
Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. Trump's total for
Tuesday's event was barely short of the \$6.3 million that former Vice
President Joe Biden raised in his first day of campaigning for the
Democratic presidential nomination. The RNC Chairwoman claimed that
Trump brought in \$24.8 million in the first 24 hours. [[Since the
Democrat Party has over 20 candidate hopefuls, Trump's campaign and the
RNC hope they will have a financial advantage by the time the Democrats
[pick a

[["This time next year, we hope to have a huge advantage of money on
hand as the Democrats will just be selecting a nominee and will have
spent all of their cash to win the nomination,"]{.underline}]{.mark}
said Roy Bailey, a national finance co-chairman for Trump's reelection.
[[Bailey also said the campaign is "off to a booming strong start" and
will be able to sustain the momentum through Election Day 2020. Trump
already has \$40 million in his war chest]{.underline}]{.mark}. The RNC
continues to crush the DNC in fundraising as it has \$37 million.

#### Trump will win -- appealing to his base, he is an incumbent, and the economy is growing

According to news stories, the Trump campaign fired pollsters who
allegedly leaked polling results that show President Trump performing
poorly against Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in battleground states.
Regardless of the accuracy of the story, what can polling really tell us
now? At this time in 2015, polls were showing Hillary Clinton 17 points
ahead of Donald Trump. [[According to Gallup, Ronald Reagan\'s approval
rating was about the same as President Trump\'s at the same time into
his presidency]{.underline}]{.mark}. In November 1984, 18 months later,
[[Reagan won a historic landslide victory,]{.mark}]{.underline} winning
49 of 50 states, losing only Walter Mondale\'s home state of Minnesota.
Turning around the ship of state is not an easy affair, and it takes
time. What happens in November 2020 will reflect three things: the skill
with which respective candidates run their campaigns; the extent to
which their message resonates; and what actually happens between now and
then on the economic, social and international fronts. Consider
Reagan\'s famous question that propelled him to an upset victory in 1980
and a landslide victory in 1984. \"[[Are you better off than you were
four years ago?\"]{.underline}]{.mark} How do we measure this? I use my
three criteria: the Constitution, Christianity and capitalism. On all
three fronts, Donald Trump is making America great again. The Supreme
Court now has a solid conservative majority with the addition of Trump
nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Overall, 107 Trump court
nominees have been confirmed, including 40 appeals court nominees. As a
result of a more solidly conservative judicial front, President Trump
has improved the environment friendly to the Christian values that we
need to restore our respect for life and family. Aggressive moves in the
states to enact anti-abortion laws increase the chances of this vital
issue being revisited in the nation\'s now more conservative high court.
Most recently, new Trump administration rules bring major new
constraints on conducting research on fetal tissue using federal funds.
And regarding the third \"C,\" capitalism, [[Harvard economist Robert
Barro estimates that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \"added 1.1 percent
per year to United States\' GDP growth rate for
2018-19]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" This is a boost in growth almost a third
over the average growth rate in the Obama years[[. Optimism among the
nation\'s small businesses is surging]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
the most recent National Federation of Independent Business Small
Business Optimism Index. Record-low unemployment among Hispanics and
blacks could be paying political dividends for this president. A new
Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows President Trump\'s approval at 32
percent among Hispanics and 17 percent among blacks. Compared with 29
percent of Hispanics and 8 percent of blacks who voted for Trump in
2016, this could be a game changer favoring President Trump in 2020.
President Trump\'s courage to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel has changed the face of the Middle East, and potentially the
world, for the better. Now a historic U.S.-sponsored meeting is
scheduled in Bahrain, where Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, the
United Arab Emirates and Qatar will join with the U.S. to focus on
capitalism and prosperity as the keys to Middle East peace rather than
the political dead ends of the past. None of these achievements would be
imaginable without Donald Trump\'s conviction that American greatness is
unique and based in key principles rooted in my three Cs --- the
Constitution, Christianity and capitalism. Even the market-opening trade
demands toward China, which have elicited criticism in some circles, are
driven by these principles. Success will make everyone, including China,
better off. Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, the most unconventional
president in American history, [[is delivering, and the dividends are
starting to flow]{.underline}]{.mark}. Americans will face a clear
choice in 2020 between individual responsibility and freedom or,
alternatively, collectivism and tyranny. [[I anticipate a Donald Trump
landslide in 2020]{.underline}]{.mark} not seen since Ronald Reagan.

#### Trump wins 2020 -- the Dems are too far left

Kevin **McCullough March 3 2019** (Kevin McCullough, writer for Town
Hall, citing polls from Gallup and Rasmussen, March 3, 2019. "7 Signs
Trump Will Landslide 2020."
https://townhall.com/columnists/kevinmccullough/2019/03/03/7-signs-trump-will-landslide-2020-n2542498)

[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[2020]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[election]{.underline} [[were held today]{.underline}]{.mark} President
Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[would win by
a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[bigger margin]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[2016]{.underline}]{.mark}, carrying the
most number of states since the Re-election of President Ronald Reagan.
I say this because like I did two years before Barack Obama was elected,
I saw trends that added up to a significant win, I noted them in this
column, and they occurred in near complete detail. In 2016 with polls
and every media pundit, and even many of his own supporters doubting the
outcome of the election, I predicted the map that would match the
election night result minus one western state and one congressional
district in Maine. As in those two cases I'm not claiming some sort of
prescience. Rather I'm saying [the momentum on the ground seems to tell
us something different than perhaps what social media, old media, recent
history or even traditional political logic would seem to indicate will
happen]{.underline}. It won't come without a major amount of hard work.
(Something then Candidate Trump demonstrated in 2016 in greater
abundance all while spending far less money than his opponent.) But
**[[the signs point to a]{.mark}n enormous [win]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Here's some of what I see: 17 of 30 above 50. The latest Gallup polling
data released this week indicates perhaps the most telling reason.
President Trump won 30 states on election night. President [Trump's
approval rating on the day he was sworn into office was 45%. For
perspective Presidents Obama, Clinton, & Reagan were at 47%, 46%, & 40%
finishing up February of the third yea]{.underline}r. All of them
cruised to re-election. **[[Trump's approval]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
Gallup is 44% and [[continues to hover around]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[50%]{.mark} in Rasmussen]{.underline}** where he spent almost the
entirety of February. But in Gallup's most recent survey the key is
where his strength is centered. [[The]{.mark} **top [30
states]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[where]{.underline}]{.mark} President
[[Trump's approval is the **highest**]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[mirror]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[the 30 states he **carried**]{.mark}
**on election night**]{.underline}. [With the top **17 of those 30
sitting above 50%,** exceeding 60% in more than one. Simply repeating
wins in these 30 states insures victory]{.underline}. [16 of 20 below
40. A deeper look reveals room for growth in additional
states]{.underline}. On election night Trump lost 20 states (a couple of
them by lower margins than Hillary's closest state losses.) Yet in only
16 of those 20 does his approval rating sit below the 40% threshold.
Colorado and Minnesota sit at 39%. New Mexico at 38%. Surely Brad
Parscale strategically understands that **[7 additional states are
within reach]{.underline}**. [He is likely already on the ground and on
the web targeting those pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-commonsense pockets
and developing effective messaging to reach them]{.underline}. The
Complicit Media. The media has already convinced themselves of the
impossibility of a Trump re-election similarly to how they were popping
corks on the Hillary Presidency in 2016. The inability to react to their
free market which continues to give them lower ratings and smaller
audiences at every turn seems to point to a delusional run at coverage
for 2020 that will be worse---not better---than 2016. And the more they
do, the more **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** wins. The President has
outpaced all who have come before him in understanding how to actually
[[make the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[media **work for
him**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And in his term it has simply been to allow
them to demonstrate their abject deranged bias, while he uses the power
of rallies and Twitter to not just respond, but to direct and redirect
the news cycle. **[They are in a sense his greatest
ally]{.underline}**---simply because their hatred and bias seem
undeterred. The Corrupt New Guard. One of the most interesting things
about Trump's approval ratings is that they occur largely in the most
biased media environment in history. [Another item of interest is the
lack of clear leadership from the opposing party]{.underline}. In
addition, the [[voices that are the **loudest**]{.underline}]{.mark}
stemming [[from the Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark} (so much so that they
have been universally embraced by every Democratic presidential hopeful
to date) [[are the **most out of touch with swing
states**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Ocasio-Cortez-Omar-Tlaib nexus is a
crossroads to out-of-touch that the Democrats may have long believed but
would never be foolish enough to campaign on. Americans do not have \$93
trillion dollars to put toward the New Green Deal. Most American cities
would welcome 25,000 new jobs and \$27 billion in new taxable revenues.
Most Americans do not align themselves with dictators, defend groups
aligned with terrorism, nor argue that former citizens that have joined
terrorist groups be allowed back into America. New scandals have emerged
concerning Ocasio-Cortez' hypocrisy in jet travel and questionable
residency in her district. Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib have also both been
implicated in questionable use of and laundering of donor money in
payments to themselves or their boyfriend. Ocasio-Cortez is also
prepping a hit list of democrats she will help primary in 2020 for the
extreme offense of listening to their district as opposed to "her" in
how they vote in the 2019 Congress. The Known President. As a backdrop
to the utter nonsense of the Democrats President Trump is demonstrating
greater Presidential leadership than the media has ever indicated
possible. Many fell into the meme that the Vietnam summit with the North
Korean dictator would turn out to be like Obama's extreme desperation in
seeking the Iran deal. What actually happened was The President pulled a
page from the Reagan playbook and walked out on a negotiation that he
sensed was not productive. Many observers believe that the results will
be similar: Reagan eventually disarmed Gorbachev. Trump may just disarm
Kim. Additionally [the domestic success of Trump policy has **surpassed
historic possibility**]{.underline}. President Trump is having the
transformational impact that President Obama so desperately wished he
could have. More people of every race, sex, and background are working
better jobs, making better wages, and living better lives than we've
ever measured in history. The President is also making good on
delivering a more secure border and in the process increasing his
approval ratings with voters who [[The Dem]{.underline}]{.mark}ocrats
have long taken for granted. The Unknown
[[Candidate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Though [we do not know who will face
off against the President in the general election of 2020, some things
are increasingly clear]{.underline}. They all represent a clear
regression on the progress that the current administration has
delivered. This is why they hope against hope that one of the many
impeachment-priming committees will uncover something that both houses
of Congress, multiple media outlets, and to date a broadly empowered
Special Counsel have been unable to. The candidate [[will be forced
to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[embrace socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[or **face the wrath**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of the]{.mark}
new]{.underline} [[hardliners]{.mark} on the left]{.underline}. And with
California being such an early primary state in this cycle expect the
wildest most extreme public policy positions to emerge. Hence it is
important to remember that the "[[dem]{.mark}ocrat[s" who vote in
the]{.mark} general election in the entirety of the **[rust
belt]{.mark}** [will have]{.mark} **[little in common]{.mark}** [with
"The Dem]{.mark}ocrat" [who wins]{.mark}]{.underline} California's
[presidential [primary]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Blue State, The Red
Map. So how does he do it? With people like "@AOC" becoming every day
faces (as well as the number two---only behind President
Trump---influencer on social media) of The opposition party? Simple.
**[The darker the hard blue states become, the easier it is for purple
states to turn pink]{.underline}**. The issue comes down to this: [[With
the President holding **90% of his base**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
with his best approval ratings occurring in the 30 states he already
won]{.underline}\... [With Democrats holding Congress and the 13**%
approval rating** that comes with it]{.underline}\... [With Democrats
watching 4-7 additional states beginning to slip through their fingers
because of an improved economy, higher wages, better border
security,]{.underline} and a long list of presidential promises kept\...
With Democrats proposing ill-conceived non-solutions that show
(according to analysts) only marginal climate alteration after they warn
us that we will die in 12 years and a \$93 trillion dollar price tag\...
It appears (pretty convincingly) that President
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} earn a
**[[second term]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And given the options, more
people in more states seem to be coming to the same conclusion.

### Thumper Dump

**Trump blames Dems all the time anyway\-\--debt ceiling, wall &
immigration, investigations\-\--they'll overreach with investigations
and obstructing his agenda**

**Too many black swans and thumpers make predictions impossible**

**Young and Jackson,** DailyBeast, 12/6/**18** \[Clifford, and Chris,
"Trump Should Have a 70% Chance of Winning in 2020",
[[https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-should-have-a-70-percent-chance-of-winning-in-2020]{.underline}](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-should-have-a-70-percent-chance-of-winning-in-2020),
accessed 1/4/19\]

**[There is, however, one major variable that can upend these
statistical likelihoods: Is Trump just too different from past
presidents? After all, he only has the support of his base; he spurns
all norms of behavior for a president; he is besieged by multiple
scandals; his relationship with the truth is malleable; he only won by
razor-thin margins in many swing states; and so on. Put differently,
[should Trump's real chances of victory be discounted relative to "what
is typical" based on his atypical behavior?]{.mark}]{.underline}** There
are some indicators that suggest he may underperform the models in 2020.
**[[1. Trump's approval ratings could decline.]{.mark}]{.underline}** If
fewer than 40 percent of Americans approve of his job performance, that
shifts his advantage to a tossup. Trump's approval could take hits from
any number of sources, including an economic downturn or external
events, such as the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Today,
Trump's numbers are being buoyed by the strong economy. Yet with
predictions of a weakening global economy and higher interest rates,
these numbers could be in jeopardy---a point of increase in unemployment
levels corresponds with a 2 point decline in approval ratings, for
instance. But absent a major economic crash, the effect on Trump's job
approval is likely to be small. Beyond the economy, Trump's history of
suboptimal leadership decisions, questionable personal conduct, and
corruption scandals have had negative impacts on his approval ratings.
However, these dips typically have a short half-life with his numbers
reverting back to the status quo ante. **[The open question will be: Do
the Mueller report or Democratic investigations lead to a more prolonged
dip? If Trump loses 4 to 5 percentage points heading into 2020, that
could be enough to potentially sink re-election. [2. Turnout will be key
in 2020.]{.mark} With Democrats holding a 5 percentage point advantage
in the total number of voters, [strong turnout in the Republican base is
vital for Republican chances.]{.mark} In 2016, Republican voters were
more engaged than Democrats on the whole]{.underline}**. Under Trump,
polling in the lead-up to the 2018 election signaled that Democratic and
Republican enthusiasm was roughly tied, and indeed more Democrats voted
than Republicans in the recent election. If this Democratic enthusiasm
can hold through 2020, Trump could be in trouble. Further, with the 2020
nomination battle wide-open, Democrats could nominate a charismatic
figure able to run a more popular effort than Hillary Clinton was able
to muster in 2016. That would further energize the Democratic base and
persuade undecided voters and independents. **[[3. The Future of White
Identity Politics is complicated.]{.mark} Trump won in 2016 with
explicit appeals to white identity politics. He needs to again win the
majority of white voters in 2020. However, there are signs that he does
not have this portion of the electorate locked down.]{.underline}**
College-educated white women, in particular, are the Republican
Achilles\' heel. In 2016, Trump won white voters overall but lost
college-educated white women by 7 points. In 2018, congressional
Republicans lost college-educated white women by 20 points. With these
women representing one-sixth of the electorate, Trump needs to break
even here while rolling up large margins with other white voters in
order to win. **[[4. Whither 2020?]{.mark}]{.underline}** With all
things being equal, **[the Republicans should be in a strong position
going into 2020. With approval ratings in the low 40s, a typical
incumbent has a 70 percent chance of winning reelection. But this
projection assumes all things are equal, and with Donald Trump, one
should never make such strong assumptions. At this moment in time,
evidence indicates that [Trump]{.mark} will be at the lower end of
historical range. While he still [has the advantages of incumbency and
an unmatched ability to control the news cycle]{.mark}, he has limited
his ceiling of support and nurtured fervor on the other side. As a
starting point, some 23 months before the election, we say his [odds of
reelection are 55/45. Still the favorite, but it can be anyone's
game.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

challenging N]{.mark}ational [R]{.mark}ifle [A]{.mark}ssociation-backed
Republicans in this year's midterm elections.]{.underline} Sen. Chris
Murphy, D-Conn., organized the one-day effort, which includes some of
his most famous colleagues: Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Cory
Booker, D-N.J., Kirsten Gillibrand D-N.Y., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Tim
Kaine, D-Va., and Rep. Joe Kennedy --- all of whom have been discussed
as potential presidential candidates. "[[It's amazing how this issue has
become one of the few litmus test issues in our party]{.mark}," Murphy
said in an interview with NBC News, noting he was advised to avoid
talking about guns when he first ran for Congress in 2006. "If you want
to be a leader in the Democratic Party, you not only have to have the
right position on guns, but you have to be a leader on
guns.\"]{.underline} Next Friday, the lawmakers will use their large
email fundraising lists and social media platforms for a one-day push to
raise money for eight House and Senate candidates running against
Republicans with perfect ratings from the NRA. The effort, dubbed
\"NR8\" aims to raise at least \$1 million for Democrats in seven key
battleground House districts and one contested Senate state, Nevada.
After years of being outmaneuvered by the NRA, gun control groups met
shortly after the Parkland, Florida shooting this year and agreed to
better coordinate their electoral efforts for this year's elections,
instead of pursuing separate strategies. [["This is the first time that
we've all gotten together, identified a handful of really important
races', and taken the movement for a test drive,]{.mark}" Murphy said,
noting his effort includes nearly all the major gun violence group. "I
think we're at a very different moment than we were a few years
ago."]{.underline}

[[After healthcare topped]{.mark} voter priorities in the [2018

plans for 2020 campaigns]{.mark}. Here are three takeaways: [Candidates
will continue to promote familiar plans for reform in 2020. Democratic
candidates are likely to present a range of plans]{.mark} that include a
public option, from single-payer healthcare to hybrid plans that
incorporate elements of the private insurance industry.]{.underline}
Republican candidates will focus on opposing the ACA and presenting a
state-based reform plan, similar to the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson
amendment presented in the Senate in fall 2017. The focus will likely be
to repeal at least some of the ACA and replace it with legislation that
gives states more control over their healthcare policy, likely in the
form of block grants.

[The partial government shutdown is beginning to drag on President
Trump's approval rating, which is at]{.underline} its lowest point in
months. As of early Wednesday evening, his approval rating was [40.2
percent](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/),
according to our tracking of public polling, down from 42.2 percent on
Dec. 21, the day before the shutdown began. It's his lowest score since
last September. And Trump's disapproval rating was 54.8 percent, up from
52.7 percent before the shutdown. His net approval rating, -14.6
percent, was at its lowest point since February 2018. [There shouldn't
be much doubt that the shutdown is behind the negative turn in Trump's
numbers.]{.underline} While there have been other newsworthy events over
the past few weeks, such as [turnover among Trump's senior
staffers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/jim-mattis-defense-secretary-trump.html)and
a [wobbly stock
market](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=%5EDJI), the shift is
well-timed to the start of the shutdown on Dec. 22. Trump's approval
ratings had been steady at about 42 percent for several months before
the shutdown. Since then, they've been declining at a fairly linear rate
of about half a point for every week that the shutdown has been
underway, while his disapproval rating has increased by half a point per
week. [Trump's increasingly negative ratings match polling showing

In a [Marist College
poll](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_1901141359.pdf#page=3)
that was released this week, for example, 61 percent of respondents said
the shutdown had given them a more negative view of Trump, while just 28
percent said they felt more positively toward him. **[So [all of that
sounds pretty bad for Trump. But will any of it really matter]{.mark} to
Trump's political standing, [in the long run]{.mark}? The glib answer is
["probably not." We're a loooong way from the presidential
election.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [And presidential approval ratings, as
well as those for congressional leaders, [typically rebound within a
couple of months of a shutdown
ending](https://news.gallup.com/poll/164714/history-suggests-shutdown-stakes-may-not-high.aspx)]{.underline}.
A shutdown in October 2013 that caused a [steep decline in
ratings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-major-damage-to-gop-after-shutdown-and-broad-dissatisfaction-with-government/2013/10/21/dae5c062-3a84-11e3-b7ba-503fb5822c3e_story.html?utm_term=.acd499ffd0ea)
for congressional Republicans didn't prevent them from having a
[terrific midterm in
2014](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2014/11/05/4156eaf0-5330-11e4-892e-602188e70e9c_story.html),
for instance. [Also [consider the]{.mark} [[insane velocity of the news
cycle under President
Trump](https://morningconsult.com/seen-read-heard/). If the shutdown
were to end on Feb. 15, and special counsel Robert Mueller's report on
the Russia investigation were to drop the next day, would anyone still
be talking about the shutdown]{.mark}?]{.underline} Moreover, there
hasn't been that much of a shift, so far. In the context of the narrow
historic range of President Trump's approval ratings, which have rarely
been higher than 43 percent or lower than 37 percent, a 2-point shift
might seem relatively large. But it's still just 2 points, when many
past presidents saw there numbers [gyrate up and down by 5 or 10 points
at a
time](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo).
But I wonder if that answer isn't a little too glib. There are some
reasons for Trump and Republicans to worry that the shutdown could have
both short- and long-term downsides. For one thing, there's no
particular sign that the shutdown is set to end any time soon. And if
the decline in Trump's approval rating were to continue at the same rate
that it has so far, it would take his political standing from bad to
worse. By Jan. 29, for example, the day that Trump was originally set to
deliver the State of the Union address before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
[disinvited him from addressing
Congress](https://www.ajc.com/news/national/state-the-union-address-can-nancy-pelosi-rescind-donald-trump-invitation/t0TQQVPpCmVTpd9PDsiO7H/),
his approval rating would be 39.3 percent, and his disapproval rating
would be 55.9 percent. By March 1, at which point [funding for federal
food stamps could run
out](https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/jan/15/delaware-health-and-social-services/are-food-stamps-going-be-unavailable-march/),
his approval rating and disapproval rating would be 36.9 percent and
58.4 percent, respectively, roughly matching the lowest point of his
presidency so far. In addition, because this is already the longest
shutdown in U.S. history, past precedent for the political impact of
shutdowns may not be fully informative. There's the possibility that the
shutdown ends not with a whimper (with Trump caving or with he and
Pelosi anticlimactically reaching a compromise) but instead with a
literal or proverbial bang, such as the government bungling a [response
to a natural or man-made
disaster](https://www.alternet.org/2019/01/expert-in-natural-disaster-planning-explains-why-the-shutdown-will-affect-workers-long-after-federal-employees-return-to-work/).
A prolonged shutdown could also [materially affect the
economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/government-shutdown-economy.html),
although there could be some [catch-up growth
later](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12510974). A temporary
decline in GDP or consumer confidence probably wouldn't affect Trump's
re-election, although a [long-term decline obviously
would](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/measuring-the-effect-of-the-economy-on-elections/).
**[Despite those possibilities, I'd still put a lot of weight toward our
historical priors, which contain relatively good news for Trump. With
almost 22 months to go until the election, [it's too early for either
approval ratings or economic data to be highly predictive of a
president's re-election chances]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Furthermore,
approval ratings tend to rebound after shutdowns, and in any event, the
decline in Trump's numbers hasn't been all that large, yet. Nonetheless,
if I were hoping for Trump's re-election, there are two indirect reasons
that the shutdown and its fallout would worry me. One has to do with his
relationship with the congressional GOP; the other with his strategic
posture toward his re-election bid. The shutdown may have frayed Trump's
relationship with Republicans in Congress Republican leaders in Congress
didn't want the shutdown in the first place. Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell and former Majority Whip John Cornyn [originally thought
they'd talked Trump out of shutting down the
government](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/18/white-house-indicates-it-wants-to-avoid-partial-government-shutdown-1067922)
--- "I don't know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think
all the president's advisers are telling him this would not be good,"
Cornyn told Politico on Dec. 18 --- before Trump shifted strategies [in
response to right-wing
pressure](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/423019-retiring-gop-lawmaker-trump-fell-in-line-behind-hannity-on-border-wall).
Meanwhile, two of the most vulnerable Republican senators ---
[Colorado's Cory
Gardner](https://www.denverpost.com/2019/01/03/cory-gardner-calls-for-shutdown-to-end/)
and [Maine's Susan
Collins](https://www.pressherald.com/2019/01/03/sen-collins-support-for-ending-shutdown-points-to-cracks-in-republican-strategy/)

[Trump's unpopularity]{.underline} really [matters, and it works against
him]{.underline} Despite the shifts documented above, [[Trump]{.mark}
**doesn't win over his followers on every issue**]{.underline}. [And in
general, he [might be making the public **less sympathetic to his
views**]{.mark} rather than more so]{.underline}. [Even when
[Trump]{.mark} does convert followers]{.underline} to his point of view,
**[that [doesn't]{.mark} mean that he's [convert]{.mark}ed [the
public]{.mark} at large]{.underline}**. [There are more independents and
Democrats than there are Republicans]{.underline}, so [if independents
and Democrats are both getting more anti-Russia and Republicans are
growing more pro-Russia,]{.underline} then [that would mean Russia is
getting **less popular overall.**]{.underline} Furthermore, [when a
president is unpopular, people are less likely to tell pollsters that
they're a member of that president's party]{.underline}. [That can bias
the president's apparent popularity]{.underline} among his party
[upward]{.underline}, since pollsters are then only asking people who
are sufficiently committed that they haven't stopped identifying with
that party. [[Trump is]{.mark},]{.underline} of course, **[unusually
unpopular]{.underline}**, and sure enough, [you can see
that]{.underline} unpopularity [[having a pronounced effect on]{.mark}
overall public opinion on **[specific issues]{.mark}.**]{.underline} My
colleague Matt Yglesias refers to it as a "reverse Midas touch." [Take
[Obamacare]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example. [For much of]{.underline}
President [Obama's second term, the bill's popularity was
underwater]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} April [2016]{.underline}, for
instance, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that [[49 percent]{.mark}
of adults [viewed]{.mark} the bill [unfavorably]{.mark}]{.underline}
compared to only 38 percent viewing it favorably. [[Since Trump took
office]{.underline}]{.mark} [and the Republican effort to repeal the law
began, **[this has reversed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The bill has
consistently had higher approval than disapproval, with polling this
month finding a **50 percent favorable**]{.underline} to 42 percent
unfavorable spread. In December, Pew Research similarly found that for
the first time in its polling, more Americans say the law has helped the
country than say that it's hurt:

Pew Research Center "[Much of the increase in positive views of the

writes. "Opinions among Republicans and Republican leaners have shown
less change." [The [Trump]{.mark} presidency]{.underline} then [has
mostly served to [entrench pro-Obamacare]{.mark}
[sentiment]{.mark}]{.underline} among Democrats [while not reducing it

WASHINGTON --- [[Congress is sending]{.underline}]{.mark} President
Donald [[Trump a strong message of discontent]{.mark} with his foreign
policy in a number of critical areas, a]{.underline} growing rebuke that
increasingly [includes members of Trump's]{.underline} own Republican
[Party. On Afghanistan and Syria, the GOP-run Senate has issued a stern
warning against the president's plans to withdraw troops.]{.underline}
Lawmakers in [the House and Senate are questioning [Trump's]{.mark}
diplomacy with North Korea, his easing of sanctions on]{.underline} a
[Russian]{.underline} oligarch and even [his intent to stay]{.underline}
involved [in Yemen's]{.underline} civil war. And [his threats to pull
out of NATO]{.underline} are causing consternation on Capitol Hill. The
bipartisan rebuke has left the president increasingly standing alone on
consequential issues of international affairs. **[He is [seeing]{.mark}
[pushback from every corner]{.mark} of the ideological spectrum [and
across both parties]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the latest reproach,
[[the Senate]{.underline}]{.mark} Thursday [[overwhelmingly passed an
amendment]{.mark} that disapproves of the sudden withdrawal of troops
from Afghanistan and Syria]{.underline}. Forty-three Republicans backed
the measure. Perhaps an even more critical component of the resolution
is that it was authored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., who has been careful not to publicly split with the president. It
was also backed by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, and James Risch, R-Idaho, the chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., voted against the
amendment because he said he doesn't know if Trump is "right or wrong"
on Syria. But Kennedy minced no words when he said there is no coherent
policy in the Middle East. "Our Middle East policy right now looks like
something my dog's been keeping under our back porch. Nobody knows what
it is, but it's ugly," he told NBC News. The [newfound [willingness to
challenge the president on foreign policy by Republicans reflects
tensions]{.mark} over his unconventional]{.underline} or seemingly
impulsive [decisions]{.underline} that simmered quietly during his first
two years but were rarely voiced in public. Two years in, and following
midterm elections in which dozens of Republicans lost their House seats,
[Trump's party appears more willing to directly confront
him]{.underline} on his more controversial decisions. McConnell's
amendment, for example, is part of a larger Middle East bill that slaps
new sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and
shores up U.S. support for Israel and Jordan. Two Senate Republican
aides say it was deliberately introduced as the first piece of
legislation in the new Senate and given the designation Senate Bill 1 in
a conspicuous bid to push back at Trump's Syria withdrawal and remind
the president that Congress has a role in foreign policy. While the
measure is mostly symbolic, it reflects concern among Republicans about
the message that Trump's Syria move sent to Israel and Jordan --- U.S.
allies and Syrian neighbors intimately affected by the decision to
withdraw U.S. troops**[. The [move]{.mark} essentially [allowed
lawmakers to go around the president]{.mark} to show the two countries
that at least Congress has their back.]{.underline}** In recent years,
most mainstream Republicans have advocated an active U.S. role overseas
to ensure national security at home, a world view that has at times been
an awkward fit with Trump's "America First" doctrine. Still, polls show
that, by and large, most rank-and-file Republicans continue to support
Trump's foreign policy. Thursday\'s action was only the latest example
of a newfound willingness by Congress to insert itself in trying to
issue a course correction. **[[Lawmakers]{.mark} are also [expressing
condemnation on issues of trade, Russia, North Korea, Yemen and
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In some places the president is indulging
his inclination to extricate the U.S. from overseas entanglements by
withdrawing troops in Afghanistan and Syria, threatening a retreat from
NATO and contemplating reducing troops on the Korean Peninsula. But in
other areas he's showing more willingness to take an active role in
overseas affairs, intervening diplomatically in Venezuela and
maintaining a presence in Yemen's civil war, giving critics of all
stripes space to interject. James Carafano, foreign policy scholar at
the conservative Heritage Foundation who advised the Trump presidential
transition, said there are legitimate concerns about some of the
president's foreign policy pronouncements. He cited issues raised in
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' resignation letter in December --- which
suggested Trump was insufficiently supportive of U.S. allies --- as a
critique that had resonated with many conservatives. "The president is
an unconventional statesman, we get that," Carafano said. "Nothing in
the Constitution says that he can't be. But he does have a
responsibility to make sure his administration's policies are clear and
consistently understood by our friends and enemies. And sometimes, it's
not." Last week [the House]{.underline} of Representatives [spoke with a
near-unanimous voice, voting 357-22 to prohibit the use of funds to
withdraw from NATO]{.underline}, something the president threatened to
do during his campaign and at times throughout his presidency. On
Venezuela, there's wide agreement on Capitol Hill among Republicans and
Democrats that the president is following the lead of Sen. Marco Rubio.
The Florida Republican was instrumental in the White House's decision to
back Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó over President Nicolás
Maduro, according to Senate aides. And now that White House has adopted
that position, Congress is attempting to ensure that there is a strategy
in place to address the fallout. At a bipartisan briefing for staff on
Wednesday by the White House, State Department, Defense Department and
USAID officials, [Senate staff strongly pushed for answers about the
humanitarian plan, security at the embassy and what a political
transition in the South American country would look]{.underline} like,
according to a Senate source. "They are building the plane while flying
it," one Democratic Senate aide familiar with the briefing said.
[Senators are also pushing for insight ahead of Trump's upcoming meeting
with North Korea]{.underline} President Kim Jong Un. Sen. Cory Gardner,
R-Colo., confirmed that he spoke Wednesday by phone with the U.S.
special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, about the
upcoming summit. Gardner, who has not been pleased with the lack of
information coming from the administration on North Korea, said he
didn't want to get into too many details about the call but said: "The
hope is that those concrete actions will be taken in the lead-up to any
summit. If there's no concrete action, I don't think they should meet."
Gardner also confirmed that he and Sen. Bob [Menendez,]{.underline}
D-N.J., [will reintroduce the North Korea Policy Oversight Act, which is
essentially a bill to monitor the administration on North Korea
talks]{.underline}. The 2018 version requires oral and written briefings
from the White House on the negotiations, continued sanctions and
"underscores the importance\" that the number of U.S. forces on the
peninsula are not part of the negotiations with North Korea. As the
special counsel investigation continues into potential Trump campaign
collusion with Russia, **[[Republicans]{.mark} have also [shown
increasing willingness to call out the president]{.mark} on policies
they see as insufficiently tough on Moscow.]{.underline}** In January,
after Trump's Treasury Department said it would ease sanctions on
companies that had been controlled by Russian oligarch and Vladimir
Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, 11 Republicans joined Democrats in an attempt
to keep the sanctions in place. The bill failed narrowly in the Senate.
In the House, [Republican and Democratic lawmakers have introduced a
number of pieces of legislation to oversee the president's foreign
policy.]{.underline} Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., has introduced biting
bills that would financially prevent the administration from removing
troops from Syria and South Korea and withdrawing from NATO. His goal,
he said, is \"to remain engaged internationally so we can shape events
and to maintain and build strong allies." "**[[Congress needs to claw
back its authority]{.mark}, particularly on foreign
policy,"]{.underline}** Gallagher told NBC News. The flurry of movement
comes as a coalition of senators on the left and the right has
reintroduced a measure cutting off U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in
Yemen despite the president's intention to continue that support. The
measure passed the Senate last year, an unexpected move that reflected
growing frustration with Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist
Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of the Saudi government. "It strikes me as
**[the Senate reasserting its traditional role in foreign
policy,"]{.underline}** said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who
advises numerous GOP senators. "President Trump is a nontraditional
president. Some of his nontraditional positions on foreign policy
diverge rather markedly from many of the senators, particularly on the
Republican side."

### 2AC Russia Hacks

#### Get hacked -- Russians and trolls -- multiple methods to affect results

**Osnos 17** (Evan, joined The New Yorker as a staff writer in 2008, and
covers politics and foreign affairs. He is the author of "Age of
Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China," "Why the
2018 Midterms Are So Vulnerable to Hackers," December 28, 2017,
<https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-the-2018-midterms-are-so-vulnerable-to-hackers>)

[The first primary of the 2018 midterm elections]{.underline}, in Texas,
[is barely eight weeks away. It's time to ask: [Will the **Russian
government** deploy]{.mark} "[active measures]{.mark}" of the kind it
used in 2016? Is it possible that [a **wave of
disinformation**]{.mark}]{.underline} on Facebook and Twitter [[could
nudge]{.mark} the [results of a tight]{.mark} congressional
[race]{.mark}]{.underline} in, say, Virginia or Nevada? [[Will
**hackers** infiltrate low-budget campaigns]{.mark} in Pennsylvania and
Nebraska, and leak their e-mails to the public?]{.underline} Will the
news media and voters take the bait?

[By most accounts, [the answer is likely]{.mark} to be
**[yes]{.mark}**---and, for several reasons, [the election may prove to
be **as vulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[or
more]{.underline}]{.mark}** so, [**[than]{.mark}** the **[2016]{.mark}**
race that brought]{.underline} Donald [Trump to the White
House.]{.underline}

Part of the explanation is political: [the 2018 midterms are shaping up
to be extraordinarily competitive. Consider]{.underline} the spectacle
currently unfolding in [Virginia.]{.underline} Before the most recent
election, on November 7th, Republicans controlled Virginia's House of
Delegates by a comfortable sixteen-seat majority. [In a wave of
Democratic wins]{.underline}, propelled by the state's highest turnout
in twenty years, [the Republican majority nearly
evaporated.]{.underline} Final control of the House now rests on the
results of the 94th District, which is deadlocked at 11,608 votes
apiece. The Virginia Board of Elections planned to draw the name of a
winner out of a pitcher, a tactic unused in Virginia in more than four
decades, but, on December 26th, the state postponed the plan, because of
pending court challenges. If the Republican incumbent David Yancey loses
to the Democrat Shelly Simonds, the House will be tied fifty-fifty, and
the two parties will share power.

[Nationwide, voters will have similar motivations to turn out in 2018,
an election with higher stakes than any midterm in memory. Voters could
determine control of both chambers of Congress, and]{.underline},
indirectly, [the fate of]{.underline} President [Trump.]{.underline} If
Democrats take control of the House, they are likely to face pressure to
embark on an impeachment. Party leaders still say that discussion is
premature---and, perhaps, counterproductive, if talk of impeachment
inspires Republican voters to come out in defense of Trump. In polls,
however, three out of four Democrats already favor impeaching Trump. In
December, fifty-eight House Democrats---nearly a third of their
caucus---voted to start debate on impeachment.

[For Democrats to win control of the House, they will need to gain
twenty-four seats. Historically, a President's party loses twenty-five
seats in a midterm, which would give the Democrats control by one vote.
When I reported]{.underline}, [in May]{.underline}, on the outlook for
2018, [the chances of a Democratic victory looked small]{.underline},
because gerrymandered districts have reduced the number of competitive
elections, and morale among Democrats was low. [Seven months
later]{.underline}, the chances of Democrats taking the House are still
modest, but less so: [The President remains uniquely unpopular, and
Democratic surges]{.underline}, like those in Virginia and Alabama,
[have produced results that were once thought impossible.]{.underline}
By the end of the year, [political analysts figured that as many as
forty races will be competitive in 2018]{.underline}, and Republicans
hold thirty-two of the seats in question. [That is [the makings of a
**brutally tight year**]{.mark}---and [a **perfect setting** for hackers
to make mischief.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["[An attacker]{.mark} who wants to affect the national outcome
[could]{.mark} try targeting all of those races, [find]{.mark} the
[states where]{.mark} the election [systems are]{.mark} most [weakly
protected, and strike there]{.mark},"]{.underline} J. Alex [Halderman,
the director of the Center for Computer Security and Society at the
University of Michigan, told me.]{.underline} In the language of hacking
and cyber-defense, [the 2018 [midterms present a]{.mark}n unusually
[**large** "**attack surface**,"]{.mark} because of the sheer number of
competitive races.]{.underline} "About [[a dozen states still rely on
obsolete paperless voting machines]{.mark}, and most states fail to
routinely conduct rigorous post-election audits]{.underline}," he said.

On a technical level, [the American election system is almost as
vulnerable as it was in 2016. According to U.S. intelligence, Russian
hackers tested the vulnerabilities of registration rolls in twenty-one
states]{.underline}, but did not alter the vote tallies. Halderman, who
testified recently in Congress about gaps in election defenses, told me,
"[Unfortunately, [there haven't been]{.mark} widespread [security
improvements]{.mark} so far.]{.underline} We can be sure that [our
[adversaries]{.mark} have been paying attention, and so they [may be
more likely to try attacking]{.mark} election systems [in
November]{.mark}]{.underline}." [At the Def Con hackers'
conference]{.underline} in July, [[attendees]{.underline}]{.mark}
demonstrated that they [[could break into thirty voting machines]{.mark}
of multiple types]{.underline}, some in as little as ninety minutes.
[Without altering the results, hackers could sow doubt]{.underline}
about the outcome [by shutting down or disrupting voting
machines]{.underline} on Election Day.

In October, Senator Richard M. Burr, a Republican of North Carolina, who
is [chair]{.underline}man [of the Senate Intelligence Committee, warned
[political candidates]{.mark}]{.underline} that [they [should **expect
Russian interference**]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2017 and 2018. "The
Russian intelligence service is determined---clever---and I recommend
that every campaign and every election official take this very
seriously." The committee's ranking Democrat, Mark Warner, of Virginia,
added a specific warning about the vulnerabilities across multiple
states. ["You could pick two or three states in two or three
jurisdictions and alter an election,"]{.underline} he said.

Two weeks later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified before Burr's
committee, and Ben [Sasse]{.underline}, a Republican of Nebraska, [asked
if the U.S. is ready to fend off further Russian interference. Sessions
replied, "Probably not, we're not."]{.underline} Despite voluminous
reports by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, [Sessions
asserted that [the Justice Department remains incapable of addressing
the challenge]{.mark}.]{.underline} He said, "The matter is so complex
that for most of us we're not able to fully grasp the technical dangers
that are out there."

[[Since 2016, Russia has]{.mark} not withdrawn its interference in
American politics; it has [expanded]{.mark} it.]{.underline} In the
Washington Post this week, Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Jaffe
described the ways in which [[Russian trolls have ventured]{.mark}
beyond Twitter bots and Facebook posts [to write full-fledged
articles]{.mark} for opinion sites]{.underline}, such as CounterPunch,
which don't have the resources or structure to vet whether "Alice
Donovan," a self-described freelancer with a distinctly pro-Russian
angle, is a real person.

Nearly four years after U.S. officials intercepted [a classified cable
from Russia's military intelligence unit]{.underline},
[lay]{.underline}ing [out a playbook for the use of fake online personas
to spread disinformation abroad]{.underline}, [the U.S. has yet to mount
a full-scale response.]{.underline} According to the Post, U.S. spy
agencies have planned a "half-dozen specific operations to counter the
Russian threat," but "one year after those instructions were given, the
Trump White House remains divided over whether to act."

After a year in office, [Trump and his aides continue to resist adopting
greater protections against Russian interference, because Trump is
insulted by the intelligence community's finding that Russia aided in
his victory.]{.underline} ("The president is right. The Democrats are
using the report to delegitimize the presidency," a White House official
told the Post.) If any action is taken, it will likely come from
Congress, where several bills seek to impose federal standards for
voting machines, and provide funding to states to overhaul outdated
equipment and install software patches. [It might be too late: By this
point in the 2016 election cycle, Russian hackers had already broken
into the Democratic National Committee, and had been rooting around in
the e-mail system for four months.]{.underline}

How much of an effect could Russian interference actually have in 2018?
The [effects could be meaningful, even if they never touch the tallies
directly.]{.underline} "More and more Americans seem to distrust the
basic institutions of democracy. Unfortunately, that means that [an
attacker could do serious damage by throwing election results into
further doubt]{.underline}," Halderman said. "[[Sabotaging election
infrastructure]{.mark} to make it fail on election day, [resulting in
**long lines**]{.mark} and other visible chaos, [would be even easier
than]{.mark} actually [stealing votes]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

4 Why humanity is unprepared for averting climate catastrophe

An attentive analysis of the latest scientific data demonstrated that
the worst climate scenarios are not distant dystopias. [Catastrophic
**[climate risk is closer than most of humanity can perceive]{.mark}**:
we might have already crossed the core planetary boundary for climate
change.]{.underline} The planet is experiencing record temperatures, and
even 2°C global warming could trigger tipping points in the Earth\'s
system; the [prevailing estimates and assumptions are based on the
stability of threatened crucial terrestrial biomes, such as boreal
forests and the Amazon rainforest]{.underline}, and **[[political action
under the Paris Climate Agreement is clearly imprecise and insufficient
to prevent dangerous climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, pushing the
world closer to transcending the IPCC\'s mid‐range RCPs. However,
policymakers are disregarding the risk of crossing a climate tipping
point. Furthermore, the real gravity of the climate risk is widely
recognized by natural scientists but by only a small segment of the
social sciences.

As experts working on GCR reduction have stated, 'we can reduce the
probability that a trigger event will occur at a certain magnitude,
(...) the probability that a certain consequence will follow, and (...)
our own fragility to risk, to decrease the potential damage or support
faster recovery' (Global Challenges Foundation, 2016, p. 12); however,
humanity is presently entirely unprepared to envisage and avert, and
even less manage, the devastating consequences of potential CCC. Let us
now focus on a number of cognitive and cultural, as well as
institutional and political, limitations that hinder our capacity to
prevent climate catastrophe.

First, the limitations of our cognitive ability prevent us from thinking
accurately about catastrophe: the human brain is wired to process linear
correlations, so our minds are not prepared to make sense of sudden,
rapid, and exponential changes. Human cognitive expectations are failed
by the uncertainty and non‐linearity of the Earth and social systems
(Abe et al., 2017; Posner, 2004). In addition, modern societies have
developed under the stable and predictable environmental conditions of
the Holocene. As a result, the current political‐legal system was
developed to address structured, short‐term, direct cause and effect
issues, providing simple solutions that produce immediate effects.
Acknowledgement of the Anthropocene\'s features is essential. The
traditional premises of a stable environment are no longer valid: as we
have seen, humans are profoundly and systemically altering the Earth\'s
system, and the consequences are uncertain given the intrinsic
non‐linear properties of the system itself (Viola and Basso, 2016).
Moreover, catastrophic climate risk is not only marked by high levels of
uncertainty, but it also offers little or no opportunity for adaptive
management, that is, learning from experience and revising policies and
institutions. Effectively managing catastrophic climate risk requires a
proactive approach that anticipates emerging threats, mobilizes support
for action against potential future harm, and undertakes measures that
are sufficiently correct the first time. Nevertheless, current
institutions do not seem capable of acting in this manner, and attempts
to follow a proactive approach within less perfect institutions could
translate into oppressive behaviours and security measures, such as
restrictions of civil liberties (Bostrom, 2013). Few existing governance
instruments can be used to prevent unprecedented and uncertain threats.

Furthermore, when addressing potential CCC, it is important that
policies neither misplace priorities nor produce catastrophic risk‐risk
trade‐offs, that is, creating a new catastrophic risk through efforts to
prevent another, as in the case of using solar radiation management
techniques (namely, stratospheric aerosol injection) to overcome global
warming, which might, for instance, accelerate stratospheric ozone
depletion. In the absence of concrete progress, pressures for early
deployment of several poorly understood geoengineering options, the
outcomes of which are unpredictable, could arise. This task is
particularly demanding in managing risk‐risk trade‐offs (Pereira, 2016;
Wiener, 2016). Hence, financial resources for innovative research and
policy foresight are needed to better anticipate the future consequences
of our present choices. Nevertheless, the multidisciplinary nature of
CCC, as well as it being not easily manageable by traditional/familiar
scientific research methodologies, hinders research and, as a
consequence, our capacity to address the problem (Bostrom, 2013).

Second, avoiding CCC requires breaking with one of the core dogmas of
the prevailing scholarship and politics: the nature‐society dichotomy.
Climate change is generally considered an external enemy (Methmann and
Rothe, 2012). However, one key lesson from the Anthropocene\'s new
geological conditions is that there is an unbreakable link between the
natural and social worlds: humans are now geological agents, and threats
to security are no longer limited to outside agents of each national
society (Fagan, 2016; Pereira, 2017; Pereira and Freitas, 2017). The
twenty‐first century human development paradigm recognizes only
rhetorically the importance of nature. Averting climate catastrophe is
thus inseparable from an honest and open reflection about the materials
and energy systems used to produce consumer goods, as well as
consumption patterns, lifestyles, values, beliefs, and current
institutions. The world requires new ideas, stories, practices, and
myths that promote fundamental changes in the manner in which humanity
thinks and acts in relation to nature (Burke et al., 2016; Dalby, 2013).
However, recognition that overcoming climate change demands a major
paradigm shift in our fundamental thinking and acting has fuelled
climate sceptics, who have been raising their voices in the media,
creating popular confusion and inflaming political resistance (Capstick
et al., 2015; Gupta, 2016).

Additionally, as Chris Hedges (2015) noted, there seems to be a human
tendency towards dismissing reality when it is unpleasant as well as a
'mania' for positive thinking and hope in Western culture; a belief that
'the world inevitably moves toward a higher material and moral state'.
This naïve optimism ignores the fact that history is not linear and
moral progress does not always accompany technical progress, defying
reality. History had long dark ages; in the absence of vigorous action,
nothing can ensure us a safe future. Yet this 'ideology of inevitable
progress' hinders our capacity for radical change. In Oryx and Crake,
Margaret Atwood also touched upon this idea, asserting that humanity is
'doomed by hope'.

Third, current generations need strong incentives to adopt new
practices. The mitigation of climate change is usually associated with
the far future argument, that is, the assumption that people should act
to avert catastrophic threats to humanity with the aim of improving the
far future of human civilization. Nevertheless, many people lack
motivation to help the far future, being concerned only with the near
future or even only with themselves and those around them (Baum, 2015).
GCR reduction is an intergenerational public good, thus addressing a
problem of temporal free riding: future generations enjoy most of the
benefits; consequently, the current generation benefits from inaction,
while future generations bear the costs (Farquhar et al., 2017).
Resisting short‐term individual benefits (such as enjoying current
consumption patterns) to achieve long‐term collective interests requires
strong discipline and persistence.

Moreover, catastrophe\'s large magnitude of impact can result in
numbing. In psychology, Slovic (2007) found that people are usually
willing to pay more to save one or two individuals than a mass of people
-- high‐magnitude situations usually translate into general distrust in
human agency, thus demobilizing people. He also found that willingness
to pay increases as a victim is described in greater detail and if he or
she is given a face since it stimulates compassion. Conversely, future
generations are a vast and blurred subject. For the same reasons,
numbing also seems to occur regarding the conservation of nature. In
addition, people tend to be concerned about recent, visible events that
stimulate strong feelings, but global catastrophes are very rare or
ultra‐low‐frequency risks; consequently, they are not recent or visible.
Since they have not been experienced, there is no psychological
availability, so public concern for them is low, in turn generating
neglect in politics (Wiener, 2016). Catastrophic risks could thus face
undervaluation.

In this regard, it is worth considering David Wallace‐Wells' New York
Magazine cover story, 'The Uninhabitable Earth', published in July 2017,
and the debate it raised within the climate science community about the
consequences of elevating the idea of environmental catastrophes (see,
for instance, Mooney, 2017). The American journalist described an
apocalyptic scenario in which climate change renders the Earth
uninhabitable by 2100. This projected scenario of hopelessness received
harsh criticism by climate scientists such as Michael Mann, Jonathan
Foley, Marshall Shepherd, and Eric Steig, who described the article as
'paralyzing', 'irresponsible', and 'alarmist', presenting the problem as
unsolvable (Mooney, 2017). Indeed, apocalyptic scenarios can stimulate
numbing, so the Wallace‐Wells story is clearly not an example of how
climate risk should be communicated. Additionally, as we have seen in
Section 2, the future consequences of climate change may actually be
catastrophic without necessarily implying the existential risks
described in 'The Uninhabitable Earth'. Consequently, it is possible to
address catastrophic climate risk without succumbing to hopeless
descriptions of the 'end of the world'. Since public concern for
catastrophic climate risk is an essential condition for overcoming
neglect in politics, elevating the importance of the topic among the
public appears inevitable. One premise seems certain, however: CCC
should not be framed as unavoidable or impossible to mitigate, but the
problem should neither be addressed with an unrealistic sense of
optimism/hope that masks the need for vigorous action. As Hedges (2015)
put it, 'hope, in this sense, is a form of disempowerment'.
Communicating the potential catastrophic consequences of the climate
crisis without stimulating mass numbing, along with avoiding excessive
positive thinking that hinders the necessary radical collective action
is fundamental. Yet this is not an easy undertaking.

Fourth, [[averting global catastrophes requires **deep levels of global
cooperation**]{.mark}. Nevertheless, countries have historically been
unwilling to truly cooperate]{.underline} without having first
experienced a crisis; however, [global catastrophes might not offer
opportunities for learning.]{.underline} As Barrett (2016) observed,
[[**strong threshold uncertainty** **undermines collective
action**]{.mark} to avert catastrophic events.]{.underline} When
uncertainty about the threshold is substantial, [[acting]{.mark} to
avert a catastrophe [is a **prisoners' dilemma**]{.mark} because
countries have a major collective incentive to act but a very
significant individual incentive not to. **[If the threshold is
certain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and every other country plays its part
in averting the catastrophe, [**[each country wants to
participate]{.mark}** since it is certain that a lack of effective
action by one country will lead to a catastrophic outcome. [Conversely,
when the threshold is uncertain]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if every
other country plays its part, [[each country has]{.mark} an
[**incentive** to **diminish** its **efforts**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[.]{.underline} In this case, a country reduces its costs considerably
and increases the odds of catastrophe only marginally. Nevertheless,
when [all countries face this same incentive and behave accordingly,
efforts to avert a catastrophe decrease significantly, **[rendering a
catastrophic outcome]{.mark}** nearly [**certain**, which is the
**current international political scenario**]{.mark} regarding
catastrophic climate risk.]{.underline}

[President Trump\'s decision to withdraw from]{.underline} the
**[[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark}** Agreement [[is **symptomatic**]{.mark}
of the enormous challenges facing global cooperation.]{.underline}
Actually, [[there has been a **slowdown** in global]{.mark}
intergovernmental [cooperation, with a **tendency** towards
**abandoning** **legally binding**]{.mark}]{.underline} quantitative
**[[targets]{.underline}]{.mark}**; climate governance is now the result
of bilateral and multilateral agreements, voluntary alliances, and city
coalitions, as well as public‐private partnerships. [Climate change is a
'super wicked' problem, intricately linked to everything
else]{.underline}: water, food, energy, land use, transportation,
housing, development, trade, investment, security, etc. As a result, it
seems inevitable that there is a lack of consensus regarding the
distribution of rights and responsibilities among countries and that the
governance of the problem has undergone a number of different actors and
stages (Gupta, 2016). However, and [although bottom‐up initiatives are
an important part of the solution, [a **global, legally binding
agreement is fundamental** if humanity is to reduce net]{.mark} GHG
[emissions]{.mark} to zero.]{.underline}

#### Paris won't solve -- can't limit to 2 degrees, free-riders, and leakage

Michael A. **Mehling et al 18**, 7-16-2018, (Michael A. Mehling, Harro

10.1038/d41586-018-05708-7

Meanwhile, nations are reviewing the pledges they made to cut emissions
[as part of the]{.underline} 2015 [[Paris]{.mark}
Agreement]{.underline}. [Everyone]{.underline} [knows]{.underline} that
[current [pledges]{.mark} [will not keep]{.mark} global [warming below
the 'safe' limit of 2 °C]{.mark} above preindustrial levels --- [even if
all nations deliver on]{.mark} their [promises]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[The question is how to strengthen actions so that emissions drop
sharply once the Paris framework takes effect in 2020.]{.underline} The
[Paris]{.underline} process [has two main problems]{.underline}. First,
[the [pledges are uneven]{.mark}. [Countries]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that

ride]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will withdraw]{.mark} from the Paris
Agreement in 2020, leaving others to do more]{.underline}. [Second,
[carbon emissions 'leak' across borders]{.mark}. [A country can keep its
budget low by buying carbon-intensive goods]{.mark} made
[elsewhere]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some regions, such as [[Western and
Northern Europe, import a considerable share of high-emission
good]{.mark}s, allowing them to emit less themselves]{.underline} (see
'Carbon balance').

#### Trump will not pull out of Paris---making rulebook to accommodate him

Dave **Keating, 12-11**-2018, \"Touting Coal But Negotiating Emissions

For the moment, the U.S. is still in the pact. That's because under the
Paris Agreement's rules, a country can't pull out until November 2020 --
coincidentally just after the next US presidential election. In the mean
time, [the [Trump]{.mark} administration [has taken]{.mark} full
[advantage of its]{.mark} continued [status as a party to the Paris
Agreement]{.mark} by [arguing for its own interests]{.mark} at the
negotiation table]{.underline}, just like all of the other 183 countries
in it. [This has [prompted many to speculate that the U.S.
doesn't]{.mark} actually [intend to leave the]{.mark} Paris
[Agreement]{.mark} at all]{.underline}. Behind the scenes, [the
negotiators from the Trump administration have continued to argue the
main points that the U.S. did under the Obama
administration]{.underline} -- most notably that developed and
developing countries shouldn't have different levels of responsibility
under the accord. The Trump administration is also trying to get
developed countries as a whole out of having to finance the climate
change adaptation and mitigation efforts of developing countries. All of
this is being debated as delegates debate the 'rulebook' for the Paris
Agreement -- to be agreed next year and take effect in 2020. [According
to [people involved in]{.mark} the [talks]{.mark}, [the intention seems
to be: get a rulebook that Trump, or his successor, can sign up to in
the end]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. could easily cancel its
notification of intention to withdraw from the agreement.

#### Paris agreement not enough to curb emissions, and US states are making independent pledges---don't need Paris

Amaury **Laporte, 12-15**-2018, \"Agreement in Poland Advances Climate
Action---But Not Enough\", Environmental and Energy Study Institute,
https://www.eesi.org/press-releases/view/agreement-in-poland-advances-climate-actionbut-not-enough,
ke

[This Saturday]{.underline}, [[197 countries]{.mark}---[including the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates---[agreed on a rule book for]{.mark} the
[Paris]{.mark} Climate Agreement]{.underline}, which calls on the
world\'s nations to keep global warming significantly below 2 degrees
Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Participating countries have already
submitted written pledges to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, by
transitioning to cleaner energy sources and by promoting energy
efficiency. But rules were needed to ensure that countries could monitor
each other's actions, and properly measure their impacts. "Today's
agreement is a solid step in the right direction," said EESI Executive
Director Carol Werner. "The details still need to be ironed out, but the
agreed-upon rules set the stage for the effective implementation of the
commitment made in Paris to substantially reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. The international community also agreed to increase its
greenhouse gas reduction commitments by 2020, and to provide more
financing for vulnerable nations. [[But does this get us to where we
need to be? No]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The global community has failed
to seize an opportunity to take]{.mark} the truly [decisive]{.mark},
[urgent action]{.mark} we need to see.]{.underline} The latest U.N.
climate report, Global Warming of 1.5 ºC, warns that we really should be
aiming to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius---not 2---and that we
only have 12 years left to act if we want to avoid drastic
consequences." Shockingly, the United States joined three other major
oil-producing countries---Kuwait, Russia, and Saudi Arabia---to block
language that would have embraced the 1.5 C Report and called for more
urgent, ambitious climate action. The Trump Administration has already
indicated that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate
Agreement at the earliest opportunity, in 2020. [In addition,
[Brazil]{.mark}, under a new administration, [blocked rules that would
have]{.mark} helped [set]{.mark} [a carbon trading
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} "The failure of the United States to lead
on climate action, as it has in the past---it played a key role in
getting the Paris Climate Agreement past the finish line---is mortifying
and saddening," said Carol Werner. "[Fortunately, [U.S. states, cities,
and businesses are stepping up]{.mark} to the plate [and pledging
to]{.mark} decisively [curb their carbon emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
They are being joined by activists, nonprofits, tribes, and educational
and religious institutions, which is much more reflective of American
public opinion. [And, we are looking to [the new Congress to provide
robust discussion of climate]{.mark} and resilience [actions]{.mark}.
Many in the large incoming freshman class and new House Committee chairs
are deeply concerned about climate change and want to take action on
behalf of the country]{.underline}."

#### Paris is not enough and Trump is jeopardizing US ability to meet commitments regardless of US inclusion in the agreement

Chris **Mooney** Reporter covering climate change, energy and the
environment June 1 **2018** "Trump withdrew from the Paris climate deal
a year ago. Here's what has changed."

ke

The lingering effect of last year's announcement, however, has still
been a climate of uncertainty for business leaders who thought they were
supposed to be acting on climate change --- and for other countries who
thought the world was united. "Officially all nations have maintained
that despite what the U.S. has announced it is going to do, that they
are still going to stick with Paris," said John Sterman, an MIT
professor who works with the D.C. based Climate Interactive on
projections of where the world is headed on climate change. "That's the
official story, and that's good. But I don't think there's any doubt
that behind the scenes, if the U.S. is not going to follow through,
other nations are finding it harder to maintain their commitments in
view of domestic political pressures." Most of all, while the United
States has not made any sudden or dramatic turn in its emissions
trajectory, that's not really the point. [[Even achieving]{.mark} the
[Obama]{.mark} administration's [Paris goals]{.mark}, of a 26 to 28
percent emissions cut below 2005 levels, [would]{.mark} ultimately [be
too little]{.mark},]{.underline} at least if the agreement's formal
objectives are to be taken seriously. [[The whole world is off
course]{.mark} on climate change by that metric, meaning that many
countries, including the United States, under-promised in
Paris]{.underline}. [The world's commitments thus far[, assuming they
are realized, would lead to]{.mark} a warming of [3.3]{.mark}
[degrees]{.mark} Celsius]{.underline} (5.94 degrees Fahrenheit), rather
than the 2 or 1.5 degree Celsius (3.6 or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) targets
of the Paris agreement, according to Sterman. So [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, as the second largest global emitter of
greenhouse gases, [would need to do considerably more than President
Barack Obama promised to cut its emissions]{.underline}. Instead, it is
underperforming even those modest commitments. [The country [is
currently on course for]{.mark} a roughly [11 to 13 percent
decrease]{.mark} in its emissions below 2005 levels by the year
2025,]{.underline} according to a new analysis by the Climate Action
Tracker, which is produced by Climate Analytics, the NewClimate
Institute and Ecofys. That's about halfway to the Obama administration's
pledge. Höhne cautions, though, that it's early. [[Attempted Trump
rollbacks]{.mark} continue [and weakened fuel efficiency
standards]{.mark} for cars, if those come to pass, [could]{.mark}
certainly [lead to increased]{.mark} carbon dioxide
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. One analysis by the Rhodium Group
suggests they could add over 100 million tons annually by the year 2035
because of an auto standards rollback alone. Another analysis, also
released last year by the Rhodium Group, found slightly better overall
numbers for the United States --- a 15 to 19 percent projected cut in
emissions by 2025 --- but still, well short of the Obama promise. These
figures on the national level, however, are being amplified by intense
activity at the state and local level, with Virginia and New Jersey
becoming the latest states looking to cut their emissions, new electric
vehicle policies in Colorado and California, and much more. Much of this
has been an explicit reaction to Trump's Paris withdrawal. "There's a
lot that is happening, fortunately," said Vicki Arroyo, the director of
the Georgetown Climate Center. "Nobody would say it's enough, but at
least we're not losing the momentum in the way we feared a year ago."
The effects of state and local policies are hard to quantify, and new
commitments are still rolling out. Höhne thinks all of this could
potentially rescue the Obama administration's Paris commitment ---
meaning the United States could still meet its official goal. But not
everyone is so sure. "Cities that are progressive and doing more are in
states with pretty clean energy already, or that have made those types
of commitments, so it's hard to know what's additional," Larsen said. In
the end, then, despite the uproar over the Paris withdrawal, it's
notable that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are hardly set to explode and
the country is still slowly moving toward lower greenhouse gas
emissions. But what Trump's move did do was create a fog when it comes
to what U.S. national policy is or should be --- something not even the
administration seems to know. [The fundamental reality remains that
neither the U.S. pledge nor other countries' commitments under the deal
were strong enough to achieve what all those countries said they wanted
in the first place.]{.underline} Slow progress didn't end under Trump,
but according to physics, slow progress and the world's climate change
goals are not compatible.

#### Most countries in Paris accord are not meeting emission goals and even if they did it wouldn't be enough to curb temperature rise

Justin **Worland**, 11-27-**2018**, \"The U.S. Isn\'t the Only Major
Country Not Meeting Its Climate Goals\", Time,
http://time.com/5463519/climate-change-united-nations-report/, ke

Three years ago, world leaders from nearly every country around the
world laid out specific plans to fight climate change that included
strategies to slash their greenhouse gas emissions. Those commitments
generated optimism that the world might finally address global warming
and helped seal the deal on the Paris Agreement. Now, [[the majority of
G20 countries aren't following through on]{.mark} their
[promises]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a new report from the
United Nation Environment Programme. And[, [even if countries followed
through, the world would fall short of limiting temperature rise to safe
levels]{.mark}. "Countries are not doing enough]{.underline}," says UNEP
official Phillip Drost, who coordinated the report. "We need to mitigate
more emissions." The report is the latest stark warning that the clock
is ticking for countries to address climate change. [[Global carbon
dioxide emissions grew in 2017]{.mark} after three years of stabilizing
and show no signs of peaking, according to the report.]{.underline}
[Some leading scientists say [emissions need to peak and decline by 2020
for the world to keep global temperatures from rising]{.mark} to unsafe
levels]{.underline}. [The report looks specifically at [G20
countries]{.mark} and shows that the vast majority,]{.underline}
including the United States, the world's second largest emitter, [[are
not on track to reduce]{.mark} their [emissions]{.mark} in line with
their 2015 commitments. [And som]{.mark}e of the countries [that
are]{.mark}]{.underline} --- such as Russia and Turkey ---
[[have]{.mark} been criticized for [set]{.mark}ting [unambitious]{.mark}
[targets]{.mark}]{.underline}. China is one notable exception to the
trend: the country's greenhouse gas emissions will likely begin to
decline before 2030 as it promised even as it continues its breakneck
economic growth.

[The [most likely levels of]{.mark} global [warming are very unlikely to
cause]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 The
[[existential risks]{.mark} of climate change]{.underline} instead
[[stem from tail risk]{.underline}]{.mark} climate change -- [[the low
probability of extreme]{.mark} levels of [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- [and interaction with other sources of risk]{.underline}. It is
impossible to say with confidence at what point global warming would
become severe enough to pose an existential threat. Research has
suggested that [warming of 11-[12°C would render]{.mark} most of [the
planet uninhabitable]{.mark}]{.underline},16 and would completely
devastate agriculture.17 This would pose an extreme threat to human
civilisation as we know it.18 Warming of around 7°C or more could
potentially produce conflict and instability on such a scale that the
indirect effects could be an existential risk, although it is extremely
uncertain how likely such scenarios are.19 Moreover, [the
[timescales]{.mark} over which such changes might happen could
[mean]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[humanity is able to
adapt]{.underline}]{.mark} enough [[to avoid extinction in even]{.mark}
very [extreme scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}. The probability of these
levels of warming depends on eventual greenhouse gas concentrations.
According to some experts, [unless strong action is taken soon by major
emitters]{.underline}, it is likely that [we will pursue a medium-high
emissions pathway]{.underline}.20 If we do, the chance of extreme
warming is highly uncertain but appears non-negligible. Current
concentrations of greenhouse gases are higher than they have been for
hundreds of thousands of years,21 which means that there are significant
unknown unknowns about how the climate system will respond. Particularly
concerning is the risk of positive feedback loops, such as the release
of vast amounts of methane from melting of the arctic permafrost, which
would cause rapid and disastrous warming.22 The economists Gernot Wagner
and Martin Weitzman have used IPCC figures (which do not include
modelling of feedback loops such as those from melting permafrost) to
estimate that [if we continue to pursue a medium-high emissions
pathway]{.underline}, the [[probability of]{.mark} eventual warming of
[6°C is]{.mark} around [10%]{.mark}]{.underline},23
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[10°C is]{.underline}]{.mark} around
[[3%]{.underline}]{.mark}.24 [[These]{.mark} estimates
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} of course [[highly
uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It is likely]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the world will take action]{.mark} against climate change [once it
begins to impose]{.mark} large [costs]{.mark}]{.underline} on human
society, [[long before]{.mark} there is [warming of
10°C]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, there is significant inertia
in the climate system: there is a 25 to 50 year lag between CO2
emissions and eventual warming,25 and it is expected that 40% of the
peak concentration of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere 1,000 years
after the peak is reached.26 Consequently, it is impossible to reduce
temperatures quickly by reducing CO2 emissions. If the world does start
to face costly warming, the international community will therefore face
strong incentives to find other ways to reduce global temperatures.

#### No environment impact - redundancy, intervening actors, boundaries will never be crossed

**Kareiva & Carranza 18** (Peter Kareiva & Valerie Carranza. Institute
of the Environment and Sustainability,. "Existential Risk Due to
Ecosystem Collapse: Nature Strikes Back." Volume 102, September 2018,
Pages 39-50)

[The]{.underline} interesting [question is whether any]{.underline} of
the planetary [[thresholds]{.underline}]{.mark} other than CO2
[[could]{.underline} **[also portend existential
risks]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Here [[the answer is **not
clear**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [One boundary often mentioned as a concern
for the fate of global civilization is
**[biodiversity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Ehrlich & Ehrlich, 2012), with
the proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than .001% per
year (Rockström et al., 2009). [[There is **little
evidence**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that]{.underline} this particular .001%
[annual loss is a threshold---and it is **hard to imagine any data**
that would allow one to identify where the threshold was]{.underline}
(Brook et al., 2013; Lenton & Williams, 2013). [A better question is
whether one can imagine **any scenario**]{.underline} [by which the loss
of too many species leads to the collapse of societies and environmental
disasters]{.underline}, even though one cannot know the absolute number
of extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia. [While
there are [data]{.mark} that relate **local reductions**]{.underline} in
species richness [to altered ecosystem function, these results **[do not
point to]{.mark} substantial [existential risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[The [data are]{.mark} **small-scale experiments**]{.underline} [in
which plant productivity, or nutrient retention is reduced as species
number declines locally]{.underline} (Vellend, 2017), [or are **[local
observations]{.mark}** of increased variability in fisheries yield when
stock diversity is lost]{.underline} (Schindler et al., 2010). **[Those
are not existential risks]{.underline}**. [To make the link even more
tenuous, there is little evidence that biodiversity is **even declining
at local scales**]{.underline} (Vellend et al 2017; Vellend et al.,
2013). **[Total]{.underline}** planetary [biodiversity may be in
decline, but local and [regional biodiversity is **often staying the
same**]{.mark}]{.underline} [because species from elsewhere **replace
local losses**]{.underline}, [albeit homogenizing the world in the
process]{.underline}. [Although the majority of conservation scientists
are likely to flinch at this conclusion, there is **growing skepticism**
regarding the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss
to an existential risk for humans]{.underline} (Maier, 2012; Vellend,
2014). [Obviously if **all biodiversity disappeared civilization would
end**---but **[no one is forecasting the loss of all
species]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It seems plausible that [the loss of
**90%**]{.underline} of the world's species [could also be apocalyptic,
but no]{.underline}t [one is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss
either]{.underline}. [Tragic, but **plausible** is the possibility our
planet suffering a loss of as many as **half** of its species. If global
biodiversity were halved, but at the same time locally the number of
species stayed relatively stable, **what would be the mechanism for an
end-of-civilization or even end of human prosperity
scenario?**]{.underline} [Extinctions and biodiversity loss are ethical
and spiritual losses, but]{.underline} perhaps **[not an existential
risk.]{.underline}** What about the remaining eight planetary
boundaries? Stratospheric **[[ozone depletion]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
one---but [thanks to the Montreal Protocol]{.underline} ozone depletion
[[is being **reversed**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hand, 2016). [[Disruptions
of the **nitrogen cycle**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} of the **[[phosphorous]{.underline}]{.mark}**
cycle [have also been proposed as representing potential planetary
boundaries]{.underline} (one boundary for nitrogen and one boundary for
phosphorous). [There are compelling data linking excesses in these
nutrients to environmental damage]{.underline}. For example,
over-application of fertilizer in Midwestern USA has led to dead zones
in the Gulf of Mexico. Similarly, excessive nitrogen has polluted
groundwater in California to such an extent that it is unsuitable for
drinking and some rural communities are forced to drink bottled water.
[However, **[these impacts are local]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [At the
same time that there is **too much** N loading in the US, there is a
need for **more N in Africa**]{.underline} [as a way of increasing
agricultural yields]{.underline} (Mueller et al., 2012). [While the
disruption of nitrogen and phosphorous cycles clearly perturb **local
ecosystems**]{.underline}, **[[end-of-the-world]{.mark}
scenarios]{.underline}** [[seem]{.underline}]{.mark} a bit
**[[far-fetched]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Another hypothesized planetary
boundary entails the conversion of natural habitats to **[agricultural
land]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The mechanism by which too much
agricultural land could cause a [crisis is
**unclear**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[unless it is because]{.underline}
land [conversion causes so much biodiversity loss that is species
extinctions that are the proximate cause of an
eco-catastrophe]{.underline}. Excessive **[chemical
pollution]{.underline}** and excessive atmospheric aerosol loading
[have]{.underline} each [been suggested as planetary boundaries as well.
In the case of these pollution boundaries, there are well-documented
mechanisms by which surpassing some concentration of a pollutant
inflicts **severe human health hazards**.]{.underline} [There is
abundant evidence linking chemical and aerosol pollution to higher
**mortality** and lower reproductive success in humans, which in turn
could cause a major die-off. It is]{.underline} perhaps [appropriate
then that when Hollywood]{.underline} [envisions an unlivable world, it
often invokes a story of humans poisoning themselves. That said, **[it
is doubtful]{.mark} that [we will poison ourselves towards
extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Data show that [as
[nations]{.mark} develop and increase their wealth, they [tend to
**clean up their air and water**]{.mark} **and reduce environmental
pollution**]{.underline} (Flörke et al., 2013; Hao & Wang, 2005). [In
addition, as economies become more **circular**]{.underline} (see
Mathews & Tan, 2016), [environmental damage due to waste products is
likely to decline. The key point is that the pollutants associated with
the planetary boundaries are **so widely recognized**]{.underline}, [and
the **consequences of local toxic events are so
immediate**]{.underline}, [that [it is **reasonable to expect national
governments to act before we suffer**]{.mark} **a [planetary
ecocatastrophe]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### Climate change is [not]{.underline} catastrophic --- their impacts [exaggerate]{.underline}. IPCC agrees.

[[Humans are]{.mark} a **[tough and adaptable]{.mark}** species. People
live on the equator and in the Arctic, in the desert and in the
rainforest. We survived the ice ages with primitive technologies. [The
idea that climate change poses an existential threat]{.mark} to
humankind [is **laughable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Climate change will have consequences]{.underline}, of course. Since
different plants and animals thrive in different climates, it will
affect natural ecosystems and agriculture. Warmer and wetter weather
will advance the spread of tropical diseases. Seas will rise, putting
pressure on all that lives on the coast. [These impacts sound alarming
but they need to be **put in perspective** before we draw conclusions
about policy]{.underline}.

[According to]{.underline} Monday's report by [the
I]{.underline}ntergovernmental [P]{.underline}anel on
[C]{.underline}limate [C]{.underline}hange, a further warming of 2C
could cause losses equivalent to 0.2-2 per cent of world gross domestic
product. On current trends, that level of warming would happen some time
in the second half of the 21st century. In other words, [half a century
of climate change is about as bad as losing one year of economic
growth]{.underline}.

Since the start of the crisis in the eurozone, the income of the average
Greek has fallen more than 20 per cent. [Climate change is
not]{.underline}, then, [the biggest problem facing humankind. It is not
even its biggest environmental problem. The W]{.underline}orld
[H]{.underline}ealth [O]{.underline}rganisation [estimates that about 7m
\[million\] people are now dying each year as a result of air pollution.
Even on the most pessimistic estimates, [climate change is not expected
to cause loss of life on that scale **for another 100
years**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As already noted, [the [IPCC scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline} themselves
[[are wildly alarmist]{.underline}]{.mark}, not only on the basic
science but also [on the]{.underline} [underlying]{.underline} economic
[assumptions]{.underline}, which in turn drive the alarmist impacts.
[The result]{.underline} [cannot withstand critical
analysis]{.underline}. Economists Ian Castles and David Henderson, for
example, show the extent to which the analysis is driven by the desire
to reach predetermined outcomes.50 Other economists have similarly
wondered what purpose was served by pursuing such unrealistic scenarios.
It is hard to credit the defense put forward by Mike Hulme, one of the
creators of the scenarios, that the IPCC is not engaged in forecasting
the future but in creating "plausible" story lines of what might happen
under various scenarios.51 [[Each]{.underline}]{.mark} [scare
[scenario]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} based on linear projections
[without]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[any [reference to]{.mark}
technological developments or [adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}. If, on a
similar linear basis, our Victorian ancestors in the UK, worried about
rapid urbanization and population growth in London, had made similar
projections, they would have pointed to the looming crisis arising from
reliance on horse-drawn carriages and omnibuses; they would have
concluded that by the middle of the 20th century, London would be
knee-deep in horse manure, and all of the southern counties would be
required to grow the oats and hay to feed and bed the required number of
horses. Technology progressed and London adapted. [Why should the rest
of humanity not be able to do likewise]{.underline} [in the face of a
trivial rise in temperature over the course of more than a
century]{.underline}? [The work on physical impacts is]{.underline}
[equally over the top]{.underline}. [All the scenarios
assume]{.underline} [only negative impacts]{.underline}, [ignore the
reality of]{.underline} [adaptation]{.underline}, [and attribute any and
all things bad to global warming]{.underline}. [Assuming the GHG theory
to be correct means that its impact would be most evident at night and
during the winter]{.underline} in reducing atmospheric heat loss to
outer space.52 It would have greater impact in increasing minimum
temperatures than in increasing maximum temperatures. Secondary
[studies]{.underline}, however, generally [ignore this
facet]{.underline} of the hypothesis. [The IPCC believes that a warmer
world will harm human health]{.underline} [due]{.underline}, for
example, [to increased disease, malnutrition, heat-waves, floods,
storms, and cardiovascular incidents]{.underline}. As already noted
[[there is no basis for the claim about severe-weather-]{.mark}related
threats or malnutrition]{.underline}. The claim about heat-related
deaths gained a boost during the summer of 2003 because of the tragedy
of some 15,000 alleged heat-related deaths in France as elderly people
stayed behind in city apartments without air conditioning while their
children enjoyed the heat at the sea shore during the August vacation.
Epidemiological studies of so-called \"excess\" deaths resulting from
heat waves are abused to get the desired results. Similar studies of the
impact of cold spells show that they are far more lethal than heat waves
and that it is much easier to adapt to heat than to cold.53 More
fundamentally, this, like most of the alarmist literature, ignores the
basics of the AGW hypothesis: the world will not see an exponential
increase in summer, daytime heat (and thus more heat waves), but a
decrease in night-time and winter cooling, particularly at higher
latitudes and altitudes. Based on the AGW hypothesis, Canada, China,
Korea, Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, and
Argentina will see warmer winters and warmer nights. There are clear
benefits to such a development, even if there may also be problems, but
the AGW industry tends to ignore the positive aspects of their alarmist
scenarios. The feared [spread of malaria]{.underline}, a much repeated
claim, [is largely unrelated to climate]{.underline}. [Malaria's worst
recorded outbreak]{.underline} [was in Siberia long before there was any
discussion of AGW]{.underline}. Similarly, the building of the Rideau
Canal in Ottawa in the 1820s was severely hampered by outbreaks of
malaria due to the proximity of mosquito-infested wetlands in the area.
Malaria remains widespread in tropical countries today in part because
of the UN's lengthy embargo on the use of DDT, the legacy of an earlier
alarmist disaster. Temperature is but one factor, and a minor one at
that, in the multiple factors that affect the rise or decline in the
presence of disease-spreading mosquitoes. Wealthier western countries
have pursued public health strategies that have reduced the incidence of
the dis- ease in their countries. Entomologist Paul Reiter, widely
recognized as the leading specialist on malaria vectors and a
contributor to some of the early work of the IPCC, was aghast to learn
how his careful and systematic analysis of the potential impacts had
been twisted in ways that he could not endorse. In a recent paper, he
concludes: "Simplistic reasoning on the future prevalence of malaria is
ill-founded; malaria is not limited by climate in most temperate
regions, nor in the tropics, and in nearly all cases, 'new\' malaria at
high altitudes is well below the maximum altitudinal limits for
transmission. Future changes in climate may alter the prevalence and
incidence of the disease, but obsessive emphasis on 'global warming\' as
a dominant parameter is indefensible; the principal determinants are
linked to ecological and societal change, politics and economics."54
[Catastrophic [species loss]{.mark}]{.underline} [[similarly
has]{.underline} [little foundation]{.underline} ]{.mark}[in past
experience]{.underline}.55 [Even if the GHG hypothesis were to be
correct]{.underline}, [[its impact would be slow]{.underline},
[providing]{.underline} ]{.mark}[significant scope and [opportunity for
adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including by ﬂora and
fauna]{.underline}. One of the more irresponsible claims was made by a
group of UK [modelers]{.underline} who [fed wildly improbable scenarios
and data into their computers and produced the much-touted claim of
massive species loss]{.underline} by the end of the century. [There are
literally]{.underline} [thousands of websites]{.underline} [devoted to
spreading alarm about species loss]{.underline} and biodiversity.
[Global warming is]{.underline} [but one of many claimed human threats
to the planet's biodiversity]{.underline}. [The claims,]{.underline}
fortunately, [are largely hype]{.underline}, based on computer models
and the estimate by Harvard naturalist Edward O. Wilson that 27,000 to
100,000 species are lost annually - a figure he advanced purely
hypothetically but which has become one of the most persistent of
environmental urban myths. The fact is that [scientists]{.underline}
[have no idea of the extent of the world\'s ﬂora and fauna]{.underline},
with estimates ranging from five million to 100 million species, and
that [there are no reliable data about the rate of loss]{.underline}. By
some estimates, [95 per cent of the species that ever existed have been
lost over the eons]{.underline}, most before humans became major players
in altering their environment. A much more credible estimate of recent
species loss comes from a surprising source, the UN Environmental
Program. It reports that known [species loss is slowing reaching its
lowest level in 500 years]{.underline} in the last three decades of the
20th century, with some 20 reported extinctions despite increasing
pressure on the biosphere from growing human population and
industrialization.57 The alarmist community has also introduced the
scientifically unknown concept of \"locally extinct," often meaning
little more than that [a species of plant or animal has responded to
adverse conditions by moving to more hospitable
circumstances]{.underline}, e.g., birds or butterflies becoming more
numerous north of their range and disappearing at its extreme southern
extent. Idso et al. conclude: "Many [[species have shown the ability
to]{.underline} [adapt rapidly to changes in
climate]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Claims that global warming
threatens]{.underline}]{.mark} large numbers of species with
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} [typically [rest
on]{.mark}]{.underline} a false definition of extinction (the loss of a
particular population rather than en- tire species) and [[speculation
rather than]{.mark} real-world [evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
world's species have proven]{.underline} [very resilient]{.underline},
[having survived past natural climate cycles that involved much greater
warming and higher C02 concentrations than exist today or are likely to
exist in the coming centuries?"]{.underline}

#### Warming doesn't cause conflict \-- best statistical evidence

**Gleditsch, 2012**- Professor of Political Science at the Norwegian
University of Science and Technology (Nils Petter Gleditsch, January
2012, "Whither the weather? Climate change and conflict," published in
the Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 49, No.1)

Climate change is the world's first truly global man-made environmental
problem13 and a firm warning that human activities can influence our
physical environment on a global scale. The range of possible
consequences of climate change is so wide, even for the limited
temperature changes foreseen in the IPCC scenarios, that it is difficult
to sort out the main priorities. Obviously, if a reversal of the trend
towards a more peaceful world was one of these consequences, it should
have a prominent place on the policy agenda[. [Based on]{.mark} the
[research]{.mark} reported here, such [a pessimistic view may not be
warranted]{.mark} in the short to medium run. However, as noted by
Feitelson, Tamimi & Rosenthal (2012) and Salehyan (2008), [framing
climate change as a security issue may influence]{.mark} the perceptions
of the [actors]{.mark} in local and regional conflict and lead to
militarized responses [and]{.mark} thus perhaps [contribute to a
self-fulfilling prophecy]{.mark}.]{.underline} The study of the
relationship between climate change and conflict has advanced noticeably
in the past five years. With regard to how changes in precipitation may
influence internal conflict, the one area where we now have a fair
number of studies, the dominant view seems to be that rainfall abundance
is associated with greater risks than drought and that in any case other
conflict-generating factors are more important[. [Studies of how climate
change]{.mark} may [promote interstate conflict]{.mark} over water
resources also seem to [point in the direction of a]{.mark} weak or a
[null relationship]{.mark}. In other areas, the number of studies is
still very low, so it is premature to offer a summary. On the whole,
however, it seems fair to say that [so far there is not]{.mark} yet much
[evidence for climate change as a]{.mark}n important [driver of
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} In recent reviews of this literature,
Bernauer, Böhmelt & Koubi (2012) and Gleditsch, Buhaug & Theisen (2011)
conclude that although environmental change may under certain
circumstances increase the risk of violent conflict, the existing
evidence indicates that this is not generally the case.

### A2 Democracy

**Democracy is resilient- no collapse- empirics prove. --elections and
legal limits check authoritarianism.**

**Bunce 10** \[Ingredients of a Resilient Democracy 25 January 2010 By
Valerie Bunce Valerie Bunce, professor of government and Aaron Binenkorb
Chair of International Studies at Cornell University, is an expert on
democracy and authoritarian rule in post-communist Europe and Eurasia.

\
**[[Elections in a]{.mark} healthy [democracy hold governments
accountable]{.mark} to the governed and facilitate peaceful transfers of
power.]{.underline}** Democratic elections require more than the casting
and counting of ballots. In a healthy democracy, elections hold
governments accountable to the governed. This happens when: • Citizens
are free to select their political representatives. • Citizens can
choose among candidates seeking their support. • Officeholders must be
re-elected to retain their positions after a specified interval. They
face regular electoral verdicts on their performance and risk losing
power at the ballot box. Competitive elections promote uncertainty among
political aspirants and thus encourage their responsiveness to citizens.
**[Elections]{.underline}** will only **[produce accountability when
they are regularly held and when they are free and fair.]{.underline}**
In many new democracies in sub-Saharan Africa and post-communist
Eurasia, electoral competition has not ensured accountability. Sometimes
this is because electoral procedures are irregular, rather than
transparent and in full conformity with constitutional guidelines. In
some nations, incumbents dominate the political playing field by
dispensing patronage to established and potential supporters, or they
manufacture "fake" oppositions and harass their "real" opposition.
Moreover, seemingly democratic regimes can prolong their hold on power
by controlling voter registration, voter turnout, and vote tabulation.
The gap between simulation and actual democratic practice narrows when
opposition parties and candidates run vigorous campaigns. These mobilize
citizens and civil society groups, which in turn organize to register
voters, get out the vote, and monitor elections. This is precisely what
happened in the pivotal elections that took place **[[in
Slovakia]{.mark} in 1998, [Croatia]{.mark} and [Serbia]{.mark} in 2000,
[Georgia]{.mark} in 2003, [and Ukraine]{.mark} in 2004.]{.underline}**
In each case, **[[citizens employed democratic]{.mark} methods,
including voting and protests, [to force authoritarian
incumbents]{.mark}]{.underline}** or their anointed successors **[[to
admit defeat.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Transitions challenge any political
system. Healthy democracies handle the dilemma smoothly and peacefully.
Clean elections and peaceful transitions demonstrate that today's losers
might be tomorrow's winners, and vice versa. Winners and their
supporters must remain responsive to the opinions of their rivals,
keeping an eye on the next election cycle. Losers and their advocates
can focus on present and future possibilities, rather than past
resentments. Confident that the rules can work for them next time, they
more easily accept the existing political order and are less likely to
seek a democratic government's violent overturn. **[Every transition to
new leadership implies change, and]{.underline}** hence a challenge to
political stability. **[Democracies minimize this challenge by holding
regular and competitive elections]{.underline}** that open genuine
opportunities for emerging new leaders and through transparent power
transfers that help winners and losers accept their fates. However,
democracies differ in how they weigh the benefits of stability against
the need for political dynamism and change, and even against the voters'
desire to return the same candidate to office over and over again. For
example, **[[in the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, **[Russia, Armenia, [and more than 30
countries]{.mark} in sub-Saharan Africa, there are [constitutional
limits on how long leaders can serve.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[These
limits [guard against autocracy]{.mark} by preventing any one individual
from holding power too long,]{.underline}** but also deprive citizens of
the opportunity to vote for a "termed-out" candidate.
**[[Elections]{.underline}]{.mark}** therefore **[serve]{.underline}**
two **[vital functions in a democratic order]{.underline}**. **[They
[hold government accountable]{.mark} to the governed, [and]{.mark} they
[facilitate peaceful transfers of political power]{.mark}. These two
effects, in turn, [legitimize democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Citizens
of a healthy democracy view representative government as the "only way"
to conduct politics.

### A2 Econ Impact

**Economic downturns don't cause conflict**

Stress and International Cooperation: Evidence from International

[Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary
conflict?]{.underline} Or might downturns encourage austerity and
economizing behavior in foreign policy? [This paper provides new
evidence that [economic stress is associated with conciliatory
policies]{.mark} between strategic rivals.]{.underline} For states that
view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward
bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political
steps to manage the competition. [Drawing on data from 109 distinct
rival dyads since 1950, 67 of which terminated, the [evidence suggests
rivalries were]{.mark} approximately [twice as likely to terminate
during]{.mark} economic [downturns]{.mark}]{.underline} than they were
during periods of economic normalcy. [This is true [controlling for
all]{.mark} of the main alternative [explanations for peaceful

### A2 Disease

#### Natural pandemics won't cause human extinction

1.1.3 Engineered pandemics For most of human history, natural pandemics
have posed the greatest risk of mass global fatalities[.]{.underline}37
However, there are some reasons to believe that **[[natural pandemics
are very unlikely to cause human extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Analysis of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
red list database has shown that [[of]{.mark} the 833
recorded]{.underline} plant and animal [[species
extinctions]{.underline}]{.mark} known to have occurred [since 1500,
[less than 4%]{.mark} (31 species) [were]{.mark} ascribed to [infectious
disease]{.mark}]{.underline}.38 [[None]{.mark} of the mammals and
amphibians on this list [were globally dispersed, and other
factors]{.mark} aside from infectious disease also [contributed]{.mark}
to their extinction. It therefore seems that [our]{.mark} own
[species]{.mark}, which [is]{.mark} very **[numerous]{.mark}**, globally
[**dispersed**, and capable of]{.mark} a **[rational response]{.mark}**
to problems, **[is very unlikely to be killed off by a natural
pandemic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One underlying explanation for this is
that [[highly lethal pathogens]{.mark} can [kill their hosts before
they]{.mark} have a chance to [spread, so **there is a selective
pressure for pathogens not to be highly lethal**]{.mark}. Therefore,
pathogens are likely to co-evolve with their hosts rather than kill all
possible hosts]{.underline}.39

#### Immunity and burnout mean disease doesn't cause extinction

**Walker, 16** (Robert, reporter for Science 2.0, \"Could Anything Make
Humans Extinct In The Near Future?\", APril 5
[www.science20.com/robert_inventor/could_anything_make_humans_extinct_in_the_near_future-169780](http://www.science20.com/robert_inventor/could_anything_make_humans_extinct_in_the_near_future-169780)
NL)

That leaves, diseases. But [you generally get a few **immune** to it if
it is a natural disease]{.underline}.¶ [[If it kills too quickly, **it
won\'t spread**. If it kills slowly]{.mark} with an incubation period,
then **[some will]{.mark}** be likely to **[be immune]{.mark}** to
it]{.underline}. The thing is, [[it is an **advantage** to the
disease]{.mark} virus or microbe also [to keep humans alive, so the
disease also **will adapt to humans**]{.mark}]{.underline} if it can.
It\'s mainly diseases that are recently transferred to humans that are
most lethal.¶ [[It is possible for species that are]{.mark} already
[rare]{.mark} and weakened by other stresses [to go extinct]{.mark}
through disease. [But humans are **widespread** and occur in **many
different habitats**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[a few groups]{.mark} of
humans [are **geographically isolated**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the
uncontacted tribes. So that\'s a different situation from some rare frog
species that only exists in one particular habitat.¶ We have made some
species of insect locally extinct by the sterile male technique of
[releasing large numbers of males that are sterile so overwhelming the
population of fertile
males](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_insect_technique) . But
that wouldn\'t work with humans :).¶ [[It would be possible]{.mark}
surely [to genetically engineer some bug to]{.mark} intentionally [make
us extinct - but]{.mark} since it would have a latency period, [a
few]{.mark} people [would be naturally immune]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
there would also be others that never are contacted. If nothing else,
then the uncontacted tribes, which still exist in a few islands and
forests, would emerge from their forests bewildered to an uninhabited
world :), That would make a fun sci fi story though I don\'t think it is
likely in reality.

Recent developments in biotechnology may, however, give people the
capability to design pathogens which overcome this trade-off. Some
gain-of-function research has demonstrated the feasibility of altering
pathogens to create strains with dangerous new features, such as
vaccine-resistant smallpox40 and human-transmissible avian flu,41 with
the potential to kill millions or even billions of people. [[For an
engineered pathogen to **derail humanity**]{.mark}**'s long-term
future**, [it would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[have to have
**extremely high fatality rates**]{.mark} or **[destroy reproductive
capability]{.mark}**]{.underline} (so that it killed or prevented
reproduction by all or nearly all of its victims), **[[be extremely
infectious]{.underline}]{.mark}** (so that it had global reach), [[and
**have delayed**]{.mark} **onset of [symptoms]{.mark}**]{.underline} (so
that we would fail to notice the problem and mount a response in
time).42 [[Making such a pathogen would be]{.mark} close to
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline} at present. However, the cost of
the technology is falling rapidly,43 and adequate expertise and modern
laboratories are becoming more available. Consequently, states and
perhaps even terrorist groups could eventually gain the capacity to
create pathogens which could deliberately or accidentally cause an
existential catastrophe.

#### Diseases don't spark international conflict -- sparks cooperation and turn inward

**Peterson 02** - associate professor at the College of William & Mary
\[Peterson, Susan. \"Epidemic disease and national security.\" Security
Studies 12.2 (2002): 43-81\]

\*IDs = Infectious Diseases

Nevertheless, [**[states are unlikely to come into conflict with other
states over]{.mark}** such **[health]{.mark}**-related foreign policy
disputes for]{.underline} at least [two reasons. First]{.underline}, and
somewhat paradoxically, [[disease]{.underline}]{.mark} theoretically
[[may **reduce** the likelihood of such conflicts
arising]{.underline}]{.mark}. As disease increases, a society may devote
a greater proportion of national budgets and human resources to disease
control. Some [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[weakened by
disease may not want to bear the **additional costs of lost trade and
military conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} and so [may respond to
epidemics by turning inward]{.underline} to deal with this and related
domestic issues.51 [Second]{.underline}, [[disease]{.underline}]{.mark}
actually [[may facilitate **international
cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the nineteenth century, for
instance, disparate national quarantines produced international
collaboration, not military conflict. [[States]{.underline} [recognized
the trade benefits of **standardizing quarantine
policies**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [met]{.underline}
regularly [to hammer out regulations]{.underline} on disease prevention
and control. [The current dispute over AIDS therapies suggests a similar
lesson: Pharm]{.underline}aceutical [[corporations]{.underline}
[negotiate]{.underline}]{.mark} with foreign governments and companies
[[to make their medications available]{.mark} at significantly lower
prices]{.underline} in developing than in developed countries, [[while
**preserving** their patents]{.underline}]{.mark}. David [Gordon argues
that]{.underline}, in the long run, [[the ID threat
will]{.underline}]{.mark} "further **[[energize]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the international community and most [[countries to devote more
attention and resources to improved ID surveillance]{.mark}, response,
and control capacity]{.underline}."52

### A2 US-Russia War

#### No Russian war or aggression

**Trenin 7-20-18** -- Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center (Dmitri,
"Fears of World War III are overblown," Politico, 7-20-18,
https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-nato-crimea-fears-of-world-war-iii-are-overblown/)

Helsinki was a PR disaster. But [[Russia is **no more likely to attack
its neighbors than it was**]{.mark}.]{.underline} MOSCOW --- Donald
Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki was widely derided in
the U.S. and Europe as a public relations disaster with dire
implications for the geopolitical world order. Yes, Putin came away
looking better than the U.S. president. But there's no point in letting
the event's admittedly bad optics overshadow the substance of the thing
itself. [[Europeans fretted about the end of NATO. But]{.mark} seen from
Moscow, [the military alliance]{.mark} still [appears]{.mark} to be very
much [alive]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump's harsh words to his allies on
spending haven't changed that. Russia is all too aware that the alliance
is focused on its eastern flank, and not only rhetorically. Since it
rediscovered Russia as a threat in 2014, [[there have been new
deployments]{.mark}, a [higher]{.mark} degree of [mobility, and
more]{.mark} military [exercises along the]{.mark} Russian
[border]{.mark}]{.underline}, from the Barents to the Black Seas. Hardly
a boon for Russia. It was clear at last week's NATO summit that allies
agree on the need to upgrade the bloc's military efforts. Germany,
Italy, France, the U.S. --- they all agree members' defense spending
should go up. Whether by 2 percent of GDP as agreed in Wales, or by 4
percent as now demanded by Trump, is, of course, important. However,
with Russia's GDP often likened to that of Spain, or the state of New
York, either figure is considered significant in Moscow, given that the
money will be spent with Russia in mind. NATO allies also worry about
Trump's comment this week that it is problematic for the U.S. to come to
the defense of smaller NATO allies such as Montenegro. But let's not
forget that at the height of the Cold War it was never 100 percent
certain what the U.S. would do in case of an attack on West Germany.
Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt would not have asked for U.S.
medium-range missiles in Europe in the 1970s had he had full confidence
in NATO's largest member. Nor is NATO enlargement off the table
completely. Macedonia has just crossed a major hurdle in its push for
membership. Predictions that Trump would recognize Crimea at the
Helsinki meeting were also overblown. There was never any question of
the U.S. accepting Crimea's status as part of Russia, or Washington
leaning on Kiev to fulfill its side of the Minsk II accords. In
Helsinki, Trump and Putin simply acknowledged the issue, and moved on.
The U.S. continues to support both Ukraine and Georgia in their
conflicts with Russia and to promote their eventual membership in NATO,
which most in the West privately regard as increasingly dangerous. NATO
is still very much exerting pressure on Russia. It's considered more of
an annoyance than an immediate threat in Moscow, but also keeps the
country in permanent "war mode" vis-à-vis the U.S. Because Moscow is
focused on Washington, this means Europeans usually get a pass. [As for
Russia's]{.underline} own [intentions]{.underline}, [two things are
clear]{.underline}. [[There is **no interest in Moscow in attacking the
Baltic states or Poland**]{.underline}]{.mark}. These countries are as
safe now as they were before 2014. [Suggestions otherwise simply point
to the deep wounds in both nations' psyche]{.underline}, which will not
be healed for many decades. [Should Ukraine's leaders decide
to]{.underline} repeat Mikheil Saakashvili's mistake in 2008 and [launch
a major offensive to retake Donbas]{.underline} --- however unlikely ---
[the Russian response could indeed be devastating]{.underline} and lead
to Ukraine's loss of sovereignty, as Putin recently stated. [But does
this mean Russia will move on Ukraine unprovoked?]{.underline} **[Most
certainly not]{.underline}**. [[Putin's main concerns are]{.mark}
**largely [domestic]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [He]{.underline}]{.mark}
[has an ambitious program that logically **[calls for more economic ties
with the West]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To move forward, [he is [looking
to **ease tensions with the EU and**]{.mark} **the
[U.S]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What Putin wanted to get out of Helsinki
was mainly to start a dialogue with Washington. Those hopes are now
visibly going up in smoke. It is safe to bet that Russia will continue
to face the same opposition from a coalition of U.S. and EU interests.
The first détente in the hybrid war between Russia and the West was
indeed nipped in the bud by Trump's behavior and the vehemence of his
domestic critics. So be it. [Moscow will not capitulate]{.underline},
[and will indeed push back]{.underline}. [But [it's **not likely to take
the form of an aggressive**]{.mark}**, overt [military
attack]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Fears of]{.mark} new [wars are
**far from accurate**]{.mark}. Moscow's strategy should now be one of
**patience**]{.underline}, [leaving America and Europe to their own
devices and focusing on relations with countries far more relevant to
its future]{.underline}: [Asia and the Middle East]{.underline}.

Trish Regan played a clip of MSNBC pundit Donny Deutsch positing that
\"in the sad event\" President [[Trump runs for reelection, he would
lose the race but likely \"call the military\" and refuse to leave
office]{.mark}.]{.underline} Deutsch, a longtime New York City ad
executive, said he believes Trump will be \"disqualified\" before the
election heats up. [[If Trump ends up running and losing to the Democrat
candidate, \"it will be stunning what we would see. He would be a
president going, I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. Call the
military]{.mark},\" he said. \"We have to look at this man. [He really
would do that. He would say, 'No, no, no. I'm still here]{.mark}.'\"
Deutsch continued. \"[He would turn to 50 million Americans and say I'm
still your president and this is my new government]{.mark}]{.underline}
Regan and Media Research Center director Tim Graham discussed Deutsch\'s
statements relative to the debate over the outstanding results from the
2018 elections. NewsBusters, a partner website of Graham\'s MRC,
[[[wrote that Deutsch was effectively

#### Trump would not leave the white house, would call on his supporters to prevent removal causing constitutional crisis

Robert **Mann**, Columnist, 12-8-20**17**, What if Donald Trump loses
and refuses to leave?, NOLA,
https://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2017/12/what_if_trump_loses_and_refuse.html,
accessed 11-28-2018 {\\\\EP}

In the annals of sore losers, few presidents stand out like John Adams
after his loss to Thomas Jefferson in 1800. On Inauguration Day, the
testy Adams passed up his successor\'s swearing-in. He left the White
House, boarded his horse-drawn coach and fled toward Quincy, Mass.,
before sunrise. Adams\' offense was leaving too soon. The question
worrying me, however, is: What if Congress ousts Donald Trump by
impeachment \-- or he\'s defeated for reelection \-- and he won\'t go?
Before you sneer at this notion as preposterous, consider the exhausting
list of our president\'s normalized behaviors and outrageous offenses
that, two years ago, would have been unfathomable: A torrent of lies and
insulting tweets, public affection for tyrants, turning the presidency
into a profit center, alleged obstruction of justice, unabashed racism,
praise of Nazis and stunning denigration of the State Department, FBI
and CIA. Today, Trump\'s ill-mannered, infantile and illegal behavior
prompts nary a raised eyebrow with 30 percent of the public. The rest,
meanwhile, cannot remain scandalized about yesterday\'s outrage because
of today\'s new outrage and the expectation of what fresh hell comes
tomorrow. The other day, Trump endorsed Roy Moore, the bigoted, lawless
Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Alabama accused of child
molestation. This shameful, shocking endorsement is now known as
\"something that happened on Monday.\" [[The idea Trump might barricade
himself in the White House, declare his impeachment unconstitutional \--
or his reelection stolen \-- is within the realm of possibility]{.mark}.
It comports with what we know about Trump\'s anti-democratic,
authoritarian tendencies. From there, it\'s easy to picture Trump going
a dangerous step further and urging his supporters to descend on
Washington and prevent his removal. [Honestly, it doesn\'t take much
imagination to envision Trump, if he loses, encouraging civil unrest to
save his hide]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hogwash, you say. The president must
leave if the Senate convicts or voters reject him. [OK, show me the
clause in the Constitution that spells out who arrests a defeated
president and escorts him from the White House. Here\'s what the
Constitution says about presidents who refuse to leave: Nothing,
absolutely nothing. It turns out American democracy is built upon the
now-shaky assumption that our elected officials respect the voters\'
will. Our system works because those who serve at all levels know they
answer to the people. The president is not above the law. And no one,
especially the president, has the legal standing to veto an election (or
an impeachment conviction by the Senate). The United States differs from
pseudo-democracies in that if you lose, no one need send the cops or the
troops to extract you from office. It\'s been the long tradition in
American politics that losing, outgoing officials cooperate in the
transition of power. I ask you this: Knowing what you know about Trump,
his values and his personality, what are the chances he would relinquish
the office peacefully?]{.underline} If you don\'t believe Trump regards
himself as above the law, consider that his attorney recently declared
it impossible for the president to obstruct justice, the key charge
against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton during their respective
impeachment proceedings. The \"President cannot obstruct justice because
he is the chief law enforcement officer under \[the Constitution\'s
Article II\] and has every right to express his view of any case,\"
Trump\'s lawyer, John Dowd, told [Mike Allen of the news site
Axios](https://www.axios.com/exclusive-trump-lawyer-claims-the-president-cannot-obstruct-justice-2514742663.html)
last weekend. Trump and his spokespersons have yet to repudiate the
outrageous position that the president is now a monarch. [A president
such as Trump, with autocratic impulses, who persists in claiming the
popular vote was stolen from him by three million illegal ballots would
have no qualms voiding the results of the next election.]{.underline} A
Congress that attempted to enforce the election outcome or its
impeachment decision could not remove [Trump from office if he resolved
to stay. What official could get past the Secret Service to arrest and
imprison a former president who refuses to abdicate? Does that mean
defenders of democracy might have to storm the White House, overpower
the former president\'s protectors and drag him from the
building?]{.underline} Laugh at this scenario, but two years ago you
would have scoffed at the possibility of 95 percent of what Trump has
done since Jan. 20. Consider also the recent speculation that Trump
might fire special counsel Robert Mueller or pardon himself and current
and former staff members if they are indicted. After Trump sacked FBI
Director James Comey, these once-preposterous notions are now
conventional wisdom. None of it should surprise anyone who\'s paid
attention. In the era of Trump, the obscene becomes normalized. What was
unimaginable last year is next year\'s plausible nightmare. I pray it
will not happen, but with Donald Trump as president, [[it would be
foolish not to discuss it and prepare for just such a constitutional
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}
