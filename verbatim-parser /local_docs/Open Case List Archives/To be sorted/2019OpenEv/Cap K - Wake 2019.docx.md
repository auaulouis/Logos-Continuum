The real question is: \"[[is this the method that can overthrow Israeli
imperialism?]{.underline}]{.mark}\" The answer from the [[BDS
activists]{.underline}]{.mark} [[always returns to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the experience of [[South Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. How was South
African Apartheid Really Overthrown? In the Western media and academia,
there is a myth that the sanctions against South Africa were the weapon
that brought down the apartheid regime. Nothing could be further from
the truth. [[Sanctions]{.mark} [played]{.mark}]{.underline} a relatively
[[little role in undermining the white regime]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[which merely passed on the privations to the black working
class]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It was not pressure from above, but fear
of revolution from below, that led the South African ruling class to
adopt "democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}". Faced with horrendous
exploitation and oppression the [[black workers developed powerful mass
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Congress of South African Trade
Unions ([[COSATU]{.mark}), and the South African Communist
Party,]{.underline} in alliance with the African National Congress, all
stood for the eradication of capitalism and the institution of a
socialist society. Together these mass organizations encompassed
millions of workers. COSATU [[launched onto the road of]{.mark} strikes
and [class struggle]{.mark} and played a decisive role in [uniting the
working class.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The strategists of capital came to
the conclusion that if there was not reform from above, there would be
revolution from below]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[They did a deal with
Mandela]{.underline}]{.mark} and the ANC leadership to end "white rule"
in government as long as the capitalists continued to rule the economy.
[[South African apartheid was overthrown by the mass struggle of the
black working class]{.underline}]{.mark}, who produced all of the
products of South African society, and therefore held enormous power in
their hands once united. [[It was this threat of socialist revolution
from below that forced the granting of concessions from
above]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it should not be forgotten either that
[[it was a bittersweet victory]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The masses could
have]{.mark} easily [overthrown capitalism]{.mark} and taken power;
[instead they continue to live the same misery as before, but with a
black president.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the new South Africa, the gap
between the black working class and the bourgeoisie has become even
wider than it ever was under apartheid. The only difference now is that
the ANC leaders who betrayed the workers' real aspirations of a decisive
change and carried out this abortion have been rewarded handsomely for
their services. They have all raised themselves above the masses. A
layer of black bourgeoisie has arisen, and black bosses sit on the
boards of directors of major corporations. For them, life is
spectacular. For the black masses, nothing has changed. [[Apartheid
enforced by law and repression has been replaced by economic
apartheid]{.mark} and we are seeing a new wave of class struggle in
South Africa today. [This underlines the need for a working class
solution.]{.mark} Without it, and [within the confines of capitalism,
there is no way forward]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Intifada and Palestinian self-defence [[The Palestinian movement has
gone through the entire spectrum of tactics---from guerrilla war,
to]{.mark}]{.underline} plane hijackings, kidnappings, [[terrorism,
bourgeois compromises, and now, boycott]{.underline}]{.mark}. Throughout
the past decades, [[while the Palestinian
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}
already [[moving towards]{.underline}]{.mark} some kind of
[[deal]{.underline}]{.mark} with the state of Israel, [[something was
developing beneath the surface in Palestinian
society]{.underline}]{.mark}. The first Intifada burst forth in 1987.
[[The revolution did not wait for]{.underline}]{.mark} the Palestinian
[[leaders; it came despite their failures]{.underline}]{.mark}, and did
its work without them. The Palestinian masses threw up councils of
revolutionary action to organize their struggle throughout the occupied
territories, and even in Palestinian-Israeli neighbourhoods.
Spontaneously, and with a leadership thrown up on the ground within the
neighbourhoods and with sheer determination and spirit drove the
movement forward. The councils mushroomed, the expression of the
collective activity of downtrodden masses flooding onto the stage of
history for the very first time. In contrast to the corrupt methods and
stale tactics of the isolated groups that had, until then, dominated
political activity, the movement was truly democratic and put forward
concrete demands. Some [[councils organized mass boycotts of Israeli
taxes, which were collected by the army]{.underline}]{.mark}. General
strikes arose and barricades were constructed. [[This was a political
earthquake]{.underline}]{.mark}, and achieved what all the tactics of
the established Palestinian leaders could not achieve in decades: [[fear
gripped the Israeli ruling class]{.underline}]{.mark}. The repression
and intensified house demolitions were only spurring the movement on.
The exploited Israeli working class watched its sons sent to the front
lines to kill fearless stone-throwing children; the capitalists
rightfully feared the effect this would have on their consciousness. The
Israeli capitalists' worst fears were that Israeli workers would make
the connection between cuts to their wages and services, and to the
attacks on the Palestinian masses. [[A general strike in Israel, in
solidarity with the Palestinian masses and their popular insurrection,
would have spelled the beginning of the end of Israeli
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, the Israeli workers' leaders
were tied to the Israeli bosses and worked with them to sell out the
struggles of the workers. They did everything possible to support the
Israeli regime in its hour of need. US imperialism led the efforts to
negotiate a compromise that could offer a more secure order in the
territories. The Israeli imperialists found willing servants in the
nascent Palestinian bourgeoisie. In effect, a privileged Palestinian
elite was given the task of policing the Palestinian masses, and
profited from the occupation. Palestinians worked for Israeli companies,
crossing into Israel and returning home at night, but also worked for
other Palestinians who built bottling plants and booming capitalist
operations. [[The Palestinian petty-bourgeois leadership developed into
a bourgeoisie and got comfortable and corrupt]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Fatah evolved from an organization that at least talked of socialism and
revolution into the party of the capitalists and super rich in the
occupied territories. [[The BDS campaign claims a rejection of violence,
**but that is not the point**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[self-defence
of the Palestinian people is justified and
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}; if anything[[, the Intifada taught the
neighbourhood councils that they needed arms to defend the revolution,
prevent the massacres, and inflict defeats on the Israeli army when it
enters Palestinian territory. But]{.underline}]{.mark} this revolution
[[had nothing in common with the tactics of suicide attacks, or firing
rockets on Israeli working class]{.mark}]{.underline} neighborhoods.
Such desperate actions are no threat to the Israeli state; they only
terrorize the Israeli workers. The first suicide attack in Palestinian
history came on 16th April 1993, and can be viewed as a result of
desperation due to the failure of the revolution and the onset of
reaction in Palestinian society. This revolution also heightened the
yearning for a solution by the Israeli workers and brought them closer
to the Palestinian masses, unlike the rockets and bombings, which have
had the opposite effect.

#### Foregrounding settler colonialism fuels violent Zionist reactions -- stops a class based struggle that ends colonial and capitalist violence

The approaches of sections of the international [[left who adopt a
narrow national approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to the problem and propose
to [[ignore the fears of millions of Israeli Jews]{.underline}]{.mark}
and their will for national self-determination, [[do not represent any
serious road for a solution]{.underline}]{.mark}. The catastrophic
process of occupation, expropriation and oppression of the Palestinians
by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel does not negate the fact
that masses of Jewish refugees from European countries and from Arab and
Muslim countries were cynically exploited by the world powers and by the
nationalist Zionist elite. [[The simplistic nationalist reference to all
Israeli Jews as 'settlers' ignores]{.underline}]{.mark} among other
things the fact that [[the majority]{.underline}]{.mark} of them [[are
country-born, without any affinity to another
country]{.underline}]{.mark}. Considering the history of the Holocaust,
the persecution of Jews and the anti-Semitic threats of reactionary Arab
and Islamist forces in the Middle East, a programme that would propose
that millions of Israelis simply give up national independence will be
perceived as an 'annihilation' plan**[[. It will push the Israeli
working class more strongly into the hands of the Israeli right-wing and
for a 'survival war' by any means, including nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More than this, even in a hypothetical
bloody scenario in which an external force subdues Israel militarily,
then millions of Israelis Jews would become an oppressed national
minority and the national conflict would continue in a terrible new
form. True, [[the Zionist movement]{.underline}]{.mark} and the State of
Israel have implemented and [[implement]{.mark}]{.underline} until this
day a [[colonialist policy]{.underline}]{.mark} striving for the pushing
aside and expropriation of the Arab-Palestinian population in favour of
the Israeli-Jewish population. This policy includes not only the history
of uprooting the Palestinian population and the settlements enterprise
today in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but also organised plans of
the state for the 'Judaization' of territories within the Green Line,
particularly in the Negev and Galilee. The [[Israeli ruling class sees
the expropriated Palestinian masses as an existential threat for the
future of its rule]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Israeli capitalist regime,
which is still in a conflict with the Palestinian population and with
the Arab and Muslim populations in the region, strives to base its
existence on mobilising support from the Jewish population in Israel and
through collaborations with the imperialist policy of the capitalist
powers, especially the US, as well as with autocratic regimes which are
willing to do business with it. Not by accident it supported and even
was mobilized for imperialist wars in the region; assisted the Jordanian
monarchy to crush the 1970 Black September uprising; was one of the last
partners the Apartheid regime in South Africa maintained; has assisted
for decades the armament and military training of dictatorships around
the world, including the former military dictatorship in Chile and the
militias which committed the genocide in Rwanda; and symbolically it
offered the Egyptian autocrat Mubarak political asylum. Against this
background, [[there are currents]{.underline}]{.mark} in the left
[[opposing the 'right of existence' of Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of
course the Marxist left opposes all regimes of oppression in the region
and globally. But on this basis one could allegedly oppose also the
'right of existence' of the United States, Germany, Britain or France,
which as major imperialist powers have caused the greatest horrors in
history. There are those who claim that specifically the right of
existence of Israel should be opposed [[because it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} a nation state 'made up' and
[[established]{.mark} [under]{.mark}]{.underline} the sponsorship of the
[[capitalist powers]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to serve their
imperialist policy in the Middle East, and because it's been established
through the expropriation of the Palestinian masses. However, generally,
the national borders in the Middle East, which the civil wars in Iraq
and Syria undermine now, were dictated to a large extent by the
imperialist powers, through the Sykes-Picot agreement signed secretly a
hundred years ago and a series of following imperialist agreements. The
claim in regards to national states which the imperialist powers created
de facto or nurtured for their benefit can serve also against the right
of existence of a series of other states in the world, including in the
former USSR territories, the Balkans, the Baltic area, Pakistan or
Taiwan, for example. Aside from that, although the process of
establishment of the State of Israel had unique features and although
the Marxist left had warned about the expected destructive repercussions
of the Partition Plan and opposed it, it should be taken into account
that a long list of national states were created in a tragic manner as a
result of occupations, mass uprooting of populations, colonial
expropriation and nationalist policy striving to change the demographic
composition in favour of the ruling national-ethnic group. However,
[[the important question]{.underline}]{.mark}, also in relation to the
US for example, is [[how]{.underline}]{.mark} it's possible
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[advance]{.underline}]{.mark} from a reality
of oppression and robbery [[to a solution to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
fundamental problems and for the [[establish]{.underline}]{.mark}ment of
[[a new]{.underline}]{.mark}, democratic and equal
[[society]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The Marxist left]{.underline}]{.mark}
cannot suffice in pointing to the reactionary character of regimes and
their bloody history -- it [[needs to show how capitalist and
imperialist nations are based on contradictions, how they could split on
a class basis and how it would be possible to get over the
calamities]{.underline}]{.mark} of the capitalist and imperialist era in
that way. Thus the State of Israel as well is not only a
settler/colonial state, ruled by one nationality and expropriating
another -- it is also a capitalist state of class exploitation and
oppression in a crisis-ridden class society. Parts of the international
[[left tend to adopt a nationalist attitude to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
millions of Israeli [[Jews, as one block]{.underline}]{.mark} of
reaction, [[a society of settlers]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which the
fundamental contradiction is allegedly not a class one but a national
one, and in which the masses have no real interest in ending the
oppression of the Palestinians, in social liberation or in socialist
change. [This]{.underline} is a [crude abstraction]{.underline}, to say
the least, of the concrete reality. As such it [is]{.underline} actually
blurring, and not sharpening, the picture of the forces of reaction in
society, as does every nationalist approach which abstractly blames the
masses for the crimes of "their" ruling classes and regimes. [[Such an
approach reduces]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, [[the responsibility of
generals, tycoons and nationalist parties for the horrors they help
create]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[befogs the
difference between]{.underline}]{.mark} ideological
[[settlers]{.underline}]{.mark}, including [[nationalists, who take an
active part in the barbaric expropriation]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Palestinian families within the Green Line, [[and millions of exploited
and]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively [[impoverished workers who suffer
from Israeli capitalism and from the ongoing national
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is an approach which depicts Israeli
society in a non-dialectical fashion and almost as one without internal
contradiction. Although the national antagonism is usually the most
prominent one and restraining the development of the class struggle on
the side of the workers, [[the class antagonism is nevertheless the
fundamental internal contradiction which undermines 'national unity' and
represents the potential for getting beyond Israeli capitalist society
and building a new society]{.underline}]{.mark}. Objectively, and
regardless of the moods and reactionary perceptions which are widespread
at the current stage, the Israeli working class has a key role to fulfil
in the struggle against Israeli capitalism and for the socialist change
of society.

Against the blanket boycott of Israel - for a working class solution For
a working class approach The working class has proven, time and again,
its power when united[[. Only organized working class action will help
liberate the Palestinian masses]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[not vague
consumer boycotts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Palestinian masses have
shown amazing heroism, enough to put through a dozen revolutions, but
the reality is that only [[one force can overthrow Israeli
imperialism---the Jewish and Arab Israeli working class.]{.mark}
[Without their work, not a single gear moves in the factories of
Israel]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israeli imperialism is built on the myth
that the Israeli worker and boss share a common interest and should
stand together for mutual defence. Our task is to explode this myth, and
our tactics must take this into account. Something must be done, on this
we agree. What kind of tactics would a working class campaign undertake?
There is [[only one kind of boycott]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[was
effective during]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[South African
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}: the [[targeted union
boycott]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Workers\' unions on the docks refused to
load any arms shipments destined for South Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} is a very clear
[[method]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[relies not on petitioning
corporations, or]{.underline}]{.mark} appeals to the [[tricksters in the
UN]{.underline}]{.mark} or in parliament[[, but on immediate and
vigorous implementation by the working class]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Activists should launch a campaign, based on union affiliation, where
armaments workers, transport workers, and postal workers refuse to fill
weapons orders meant for Israeli imperialism. The Canadian Union of
Postal Workers has signed on to BDS. Instead of calling on its workers
to boycott Israeli goods, the union should call on its members to refuse
to deliver any mail to SNC-Lavalin or similar weapons companies so long
as they build weapons for Israeli capitalism.
[[Alongside]{.mark}]{.underline} this union campaign, [[mass
demonstrations]{.underline}]{.mark} can be organized [[against visiting
representatives of Israeli imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Current
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was given a spectacular welcome by
thousands of protesters when he attempted to speak at Concordia
University in 2003. This is correct; such criminals and apologists for
Zionism should be shut down. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} kinds of
[[tactics, which differentiate between the Israeli workers and their
ruling class, are the kinds of]{.underline}]{.mark} working class
[[methods that]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[help the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Israeli and [[Palestinian working masses overthrow Israeli
imperialism.]{.mark}]{.underline} Class unity and the fight for
socialism **[[There is no force on Earth other than the Israeli working
class that can destroy Israeli imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Unity
between the Israeli proletariat and the Palestinian toilers and
fallaheen (farmers) is the first necessity for carrying out a revolution
that will end the bloodshed once and for all. The movement in solidarity
must be based on that unity. We reject the perspective of \"Jews to the
sea\". [[The solution will not come without working class Israeli
Jews]{.underline}]{.mark}; they will play the central role! [[This is
why we reject the BDS campaign as counter-productive, and a campaign
that strengthens bourgeois Zionism.]{.mark}]{.underline} We reject any
attempt to place blame on the Israeli workers for the crimes of their
ruling class, no less than we reject attempts to blame the Palestinian
masses for the blood spilt by Hamas and Fatah. The blame rests squarely
on the shoulders of the Israeli and Palestinian bourgeoisies, and the
capitalist classes in the US, Canada and the rest of the western world.
This is why the workers and youth in the advanced capitalist countries
cannot stop at solidarity[[. This fight must be linked to the fight for
socialism at home.]{.underline}]{.mark} Our imperialists profit from
these wars, and [[the only solution is a movement to throw them out here
as well]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Capitalism worldwide must be
overthrown.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [[Jewish and the Palestinian
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[have a strong socialist and
revolutionary history]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[With help from the
international workers' and solidarity movement]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[they will]{.underline}]{.mark} be able to find the way back to these
traditions and [[throw nationalism and fundamentalism on both sides to
the trash pile]{.underline}]{.mark}. Freed from fratricidal warfare and
the meddling of imperialism, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Palestinian and
Israeli working [[masses would be]{.underline}]{.mark} able to unite in
a voluntary socialist union of both peoples as [[the first step
towards]{.underline}]{.mark} a Socialist Federation of the Middle
East[[: liberating]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} and using them [[for human need instead
of for profit]{.underline}]{.mark}, and to rapidly develop in common and
rise out of the collective misery. Therefore, we appeal to all those who
fight for the liberation of the Palestinian peoples to adopt the
following course of action: Abandon the blanket boycott of Israel, which
pushes the Israeli workers into the arms of the imperialists. Adopt a
workers' boycott that targets the Israeli state and representatives of
the regime. Promote strategies that build solidarity between Jewish and
Arab workers. Fight for socialism, both at home and in the Middle East.

#### China's entrance onto the world stage is conditioned by the United State's Sinological-orientalism. To guide China's entry onto the world stage is inextricably tied assimilation into a Western regime of global governance

**Vukovich 2012** \[Vukovich, Daniel. Associate Professor of Critical
Theory at Hong Kong University. (2012). China and Orientalism: Western
knowledge production and the P.R.C. Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon:
Routledge.\]

In "Orientalism Now," the concluding chapter of Edward Said's 1978 book,
we are left with the migration of orientalism from European empires and
philology to the U.S. imperium and the dominance of social scientific
discourse. This project begins where Said left off. It argues that there
is a new, ["[Sinological]{.mark}"]{.underline} form of
[[orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark} at work in the world, one that
[[takes]{.mark} as its object [an "Other]{.mark}]{.underline}" that has
since the 1970s occupied an increasingly [[central]{.underline}]{.mark}
place [[within]{.underline}]{.mark} the world system and
[[Western]{.underline}]{.mark} intellectual--political
[[culture]{.mark}:]{.underline} the People's Republic of China. As with
Said's formulation rooted in the Middle East and South Asia,
[Sinological-orientalism]{.underline} and its production of a textual
"China" [helps constitute the]{.underline} identity or ["Self" of the
West]{.underline} (what Balibar aptly calls the "Western-
Christian-Democratic-Universalist identity") ("Difference" 30). [[The
U.S.-West is what China is not, but which the latter will
become]{.mark}.]{.underline} So, too, [[the new orientalism is part
of]{.underline}]{.mark} a neo-colonial or imperialist project: not just
the production of knowledge about an "area" but [the]{.underline}
would-be [[management]{.underline}]{.mark} and administration [[of the
area for economic, political, and
cultura]{.mark}l]{.underline}--symbolic [[benefit]{.mark}.]{.underline}
But whereas orientalism in Said turned upon a posited, essential
difference between Orient and Occident (as in Kipling's famous verse:
"Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet"),
the new form turns upon sameness or more specifically, upon China's
becoming sameness. [China is seen as in a process of]{.underline}
haltingly but inevitably [becoming-the-same as "us":]{.underline} open,
liberal, modern, free. Put another way, "China" is understood as
becoming generally equivalent to the West. What [[this
reflects]{.underline}]{.mark}, in part, is the by now familiar
resurgence of [[modernization rhetoric under the cover of
"globalization"]{.underline}]{.mark} and the end-of-history thematic
famously captured by Francis Fukuyama. But that, in turn, was triggered
by the collapse of the former Soviet Union as well as by the fateful
deployment of the market mechanism and the logic of capital within
China. After a noble but brief interruption of the politics and
discourse of modernization by Chinese Maoism and by the long decade of
the 1960s and early 1970s, the former is back in charge not only of area
studies but of global intellectual--political culture. When one recalls
the Marxist cultural analysis of capital as such, namely as an
historical force of abstraction that makes unlike things alike on the
basis of some third thing called the value-form (their "exchange value"
or "general equivalent"), the relationship between this orientalism and
global capitalism appears in sharper relief. Sinological-orientalism is
in an important sense a capital-logic, just as historical capitalism
betrays an orientalist one. As Said himself made clear (in at least my
reading of him), orientalism and colonial discourse may precede the rise
of capitalism, but in the modern era they are hand in glove. So, too,
for the present moment, whereby [[Western]{.underline}]{.mark}
investment and "constrainment" [[strategies are]{.underline}]{.mark}
often [[rationalized on the basis of]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[being
beneficial to]{.underline}]{.mark} the Chinese and their [progression
towards [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} and human rights (whatever these
mean), as well as helping "balance" and protect the rest of Asia from
China's rise. I further address the relationship between orientalist and
capital logics in a final chapter. My argument is a totalizing,
"functionalist" one about the integral relationship between capitalism
and orientalism. But then, so is the thing. The historical conditions of
possibility for a global Sinological-orientalism are the momentous if
not counter-revolutionary changes within China itself -- its Dengist
"era of reform and opening up" dating from 1979 -- and the West's
economic, political, and discursive responses to this subsequent rise to
global prominence. This paradoxical relationship is captured in the
logic of becoming sameness: [[China is still not
"normal"]{.underline}]{.mark} (and has been tragically different),
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[engaged in a "universal" process such
that it]{.underline}]{.mark} will, and [[must]{.mark}, [become the same
as "us."]{.mark}]{.underline} Whether it wants to or not. That is the
present--future offered to China within this discourse, and -- as anyone
who watched the 2008 Olympics opening ceremonies knows ("one world, one
dream") -- it is also one taken up within China itself.I turn to the
question of Occidentalism below, and at other times make reference to
Westernized/liberal views within China. But I only partially address the
internalization of orientalism within China and the current Party state.
That is surely an important matter worthy of its own book. But my focus
here reflects in part my conviction that [it is [the]{.mark}
[Western]{.mark}]{.underline} -- now fully global -- dimensions and
[[roots of orientalism]{.mark} that [are the]{.mark}]{.underline} main
[[problem]{.mark} [underlying the]{.mark}]{.underline} often
dysfunctional, [[neo-colonial relationship between China and the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}. My concern is the production of knowledge
about the P.R.C. outside of China and the cultural, ideological, and
other politics that subtend this. One could write a different project
focused on the representation of China from within the mainland; this
would have to include indigenous constructions and essentializations of
China outside of, as well as prior to, foreign imperialism or
orientalism. But the impact in China of modern imperialism and "contact"
remains decisive for all of us, and once we reach this era we need
necessarily engage the orientalist and post-colonial questions. There
will be no "new" Sinology until this conversation at least begins. As
will quickly become clear, my analysis of Sinological-orientalism
abounds with gestures and full-on references to what I take to be some
of the complexities of Maoist and post-Mao China in political,
ideological/cultural, and other terms. Contra Said's own practice in
1978, then, I do take it to be important to at least attempt to argue
for some of those complexities and "brute realities of the Orient" (his
words) that are occluded by the isolated details and positional
superiority of orientalism. His decision not to do so has meant that his
work there is often reductively appropriated by cultural and
postcolonial studies that reduce the problem of orientalism to some
basic Freudian Othering process, the deployment of stereotypical images
in film, a simple self/other identity dynamic, and so forth. While all
of these are part of orientalism, to be sure, the larger problems and
challenges of epistemology, political knowledge, and the constitution of
discourse were too often obscured even within the postcolonial field.
**[Positional superiority refers to that tactic]{.underline}** or de
facto strategy **[by which [the object of study is kept in place, never
allowed to challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}** let alone displace the
effectively a priori assumptions, conclusions, and
[discourse:]{.underline} it places "the Westerner in a whole series of
possible relationships with the Orient without ever losing him the upper
hand" (Orientalism 7). It is not just a heuristic but the foundational
rule of colonial discourse and orientalism.1 For our purposes this means
that **[[the authority]{.underline}]{.mark}** and a priori knowledge
**[[of the Sinologist]{.underline}]{.mark}**-analyst-watcher **[[reigns
supreme]{.underline}]{.mark}** and untroubled. For all its detailed
knowledge, then, Sinological-orientalism works as a circular,
self-enclosed system. It is also paradoxical in that what I am calling
its emphasis on [China's "becoming-sameness" is]{.underline} also [at
odds with this]{.underline} flexible [superiority,]{.underline} which is
also to say [the ultimate inferiority of]{.underline} the native,
[Chinese reality]{.underline}. For all of these reasons, one must take
the risk of trying to argue for and signify these complexities,
counter-factuals, and counterstories about the P.R.C. This is
surprisingly difficult to do, in part because the language we have to
describe such things fits not at all with the dominant, Western, liberal
humanist paradigm of the humanities and human sciences. This is, I
believe, also Wang Hui's problem in his brilliant and searching but
difficult works on Chinese histories and Western theory.2 My own
emphases have been with the political, Maoist past as well as its traces
today, even after its demonization at home and abroad. Others would
certainly write all of this differently, and it is again something
worthy of book-length treatment despite the professional risks involved
(writing "positive" scholarship about the Mao era). Some already have.
In addition to others cited in this study, Lin Chun's The
Transformations of Chinese Socialism is another case in point (albeit
focused on the reform era). But all of this work is of very recent
vintage and remains marginal to the overall China field.
[[Sinological-orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark} and its basic logic [[can
be understood as a development within]{.mark}]{.underline} colonial
discourse in [the]{.underline} present, [[postcolonial]{.mark} era
of]{.underline} intensive [[globalization]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is as
if what Dipesh Chakrabarty memorably described as **[[the "waiting room
of history"]{.mark} -- or [the continual saying of "not yet" to the
colonized who would be free]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- has subtly but
importantly shifted.3 The time is at hand. The denouement has inched
closer. **[The last]{.underline}** real **[constraint remains the Party
state which will depart]{.underline}** from the historical stage **[with
our help. This marks a shift from]{.underline}** the essential
**[difference]{.underline}** between East and West **[to]{.underline}**
their -- China's -- **[general equivalence:]{.underline}** a sameness
structured by a hierarchical difference. The denigrating and
condescending faith that they are, after all, becoming the same as us
(or should be made so) has become stronger and is no longer simply the
view of enlightened liberals like J. S. Mill. While a range of temporary
-- as opposed to essential -- [[obstacles can be
summoned]{.underline}]{.mark} up [to [explain why China is not
yet]{.mark}]{.underline} free and [[normal]{.mark}, the
main]{.underline} and seemingly most fungible [one remains the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty
(state). **[Were it not for this]{.underline}** anachronistic, evil
**[institution,]{.underline}** the logic goes, **[China
would]{.underline}** and will **[be becoming-the-same]{.underline}** and
joining the normal world. [A Sinified,]{.underline} mainland [Chinese
path is]{.underline} more or less [impossible,]{.underline} be it in the
Maoist attempt at alternative modernity (itself a Western/Marxist
hybrid) or in the various, nascent post-Mao efforts to reform and
develop a Chinese state and society adequate to the nation's various,
complex challenges, and that might catch up to the heretofore largely
unchecked, rapid, and dislocating deployment of capitalism.4

2\. Blinded Identities: Race and Racism Under Racialized Globalized
Neoliberalism As we mentioned above, experience suggests that the
market-state overtakes the nation-state both from within and without.
Most recently in historical terms, [[the]{.mark} widespread
[establishment of multinational corporations]{.mark}, and the
intensifying virulence of top-down corporate globalization, [have put
new]{.mark} and morphing [pressures on this]{.mark}
uncertain]{.underline} \[\*1565\] [[relationship between law and justice
in]{.mark} the material, political and constitutional context of the
modern [liberal democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. n163 Whereas both laws
and corporations are, formally, creatures and creations of the modern
nation-state, both laws and corporations seem operationally to have
decisively outgrown the limits of their creators. n164 Perhaps,
therefore, this newly complicated interplay olaws, corporations and
nation-states now threatens the very viability of the traditional world
order based on traditional rule-of-law notions because the efficacy of
foundational concepts and premises-borders, territoriality, jurisdiction
and the like-seem increasingly antiquated or impotent in the face of
challenges and trajectories during this still- young century. n165 Much
of law, as we already noted, is devoted both directly and indirectly to
the maintenance and administration of the nation-state, the so-called
free market, and the myriad actors that operate within and across each.
n166 Yet, today, under this rule of law, all three-the nation-state, the
free market, and law itself-are said to be in existential crises. n167
Indeed, the decline or the collapse of the racialized neocolonial
nation-state is said to be impending, even as the nation-state continues
to be a key pivot point in everything, both sub and supra-national.
Under this forecast, nation-states will become increasingly irrelevant
because they will become progressively less able to deliver on the
traditional goods that justify and undergird their existence. Under this
kind of analysis, [the nation-state increasingly will become unable to
protect itself and its people from increasingly globalized social,
economic, and environmental problems, or from increasingly proliferating
weapons of mass destruction, or from increasingly Borg-like assimilation
of culture and market in the form of corporate globalization. Under this
type of account, [the nation-state will give way to the
market-state]{.mark}, which will be devoted mainly [to
sustain]{.mark}ing the conditions necessary for fundamentalist market
[capitalism]{.mark} to operate]{.underline} \[\*1566\] much as we know
it today, except even more so. n168 Under this sort of scenario,
moreover, [traditional [identities like race or ethnicity \"naturally\"
tend to become irrelevant]{.mark}; so do relative or diverse cultural
and political normativities; [all that matters is \"the
market,\"]{.mark} in which colorblinded multiculturalism will
occur]{.underline}, if at all, [organically]{.underline}, as it should,
of course. [The market-state]{.underline}, however, [will be not only
colorblind, but identity blind: blind, for example, to the increasingly
documented exploitation of traditionally subordinated identity
groups-women, indigenous people, children, poor communities, oftentimes
of color]{.underline}-throughout the entire planet by the
agro-industrial complex owned and controlled by traditionally elite
groups. n169 Consequently, under this account [the colorblind
market-state will help to usher in a new and normalized post- racial
sensibility that mirrors the equivalent sensibility being propagated
domestically]{.underline}. Under this account, [the only color said to
count either domestically or transnationally is the color of merit and
money-as if the neocolonial color of merit and money can ever be
disconnected from the cultural and material stratification of life
emplaced through identity-based colonialism and
imperialism]{.underline}. Under this account, in effect, [neoliberal
globalization and corporate capitalism are a done deal for the world\'s
masses. Our fate is set: \"free-market fundamentalism\" is the new
(colorblind, post-racial) normativity]{.underline}, if one exists at
all. n170 If this prognostication is correct, the traditional
nation-state increasingly will become (mainly/merely?) a shell for
advancing corporate activity-a condition some might say is already the
case, and perhaps has been all along. n171 This predicted (or ongoing)
transition from the nation-state to the market-state no doubt will
depend in great measure on the management of law-both internal and
international, both as written and as applied. Already, however, we can
see (again) at the international or transnational level the replication
of contradiction, corruption, complexity, and the makings of crisis. The
same racialized and identity- inflected dynamics that historically gave
shape to law\'s structural dissonance and systemic dysfunction at the
national/domestic level are today giving shape to \[\*1567\]
internationalized or transnationalized law. n172 In short, the
identitarian frame misalignments that CRT confronted within the
nation-state during the past twenty years now await critical race
interrogation across the world system of nation-states caught in the
riptides of globalized neoliberalism. 3. Law, Nation-State, and
Racialization: From Colonialism to Imperialism to Global Neoliberalism
Historically, the dominant narrative of international law is that it is
the result of practical and political arrangements devised pragmatically
by dominant sovereigns on the basis of the nation-state system. This
dominant narrative is a colorblind fiction because the origins of
international law-like the origins of law generally-are found in the
more specific need of the ruler to rule the ruled. International law,
like domestic law, is the product of local and national elites
constructed through race and gender politics reproducing at the
trans-national level the same arrangements imposed at the national and
sub-national levels: relationships of domination and subordination in
the name of goals and values like justice, equality, and dignity. Thus,
[[the origins of internationalized law are found in the structural need
of (white)]{.mark} colonial [elites]{.mark} [to control]{.mark} and
exploit their (non-white) [colonies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It is found
in the need of]{.mark} dominant nation-states in [the North and
West]{.mark} of the globe during the fifteenth through nineteenth
centuries [to promote their]{.mark} own sense of [security]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} their self-serving systems of exploitative
[commerce]{.mark}]{.underline}. n173 More recently, [after World War
II]{.underline}, as we noted above, [we see the emergent and
consolidating system of [international law]{.mark} take on a tripartite
agenda that crystallizes during the twentieth century these original and
historical imperatives. The racial and racializing continuities that
stretch from colonialism to imperialism and, now, neoliberal
globalization [underscore]{.mark} the continuities of \"[domestic\"
racisms within the nation-state and those that travel a]{.mark}nd
replicate [transnationally]{.mark} across the face of this
Earth]{.underline}. Not too surprisingly, [[the first item]{.mark} on
this modern and re-racialized agenda [remains the management of former
colonies]{.mark}-now denominated as a \"third world\"-[in a manner that
still preserves]{.mark} \"traditional\" [neocolonial
privilege]{.mark}]{.underline}. n174 Not unconnected to this aim is the
second agenda item: \[\*1568\] orchestrating the management of Cold War
politics at a global level to ensure again the triumph of the
(white-controlled) North and West nation-states, and their political or
economic preferences, in the \"new\" world order under construction
after the Second World War. n175 And the third item of this modern
agenda for internationalized law has been [the promotion of economic
\"[globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}\" as a process that
[systematically [buttresses neocolonial hierarchies]{.mark} and related
socioeconomic arrangements [through]{.mark} the [care]{.mark} and
feeding [of]{.mark} mega [multinational]{.mark}
[monsters]{.mark}]{.underline}. n176 These three modern-day and
continuing pursuits effectively crystallize the historical racial
imperatives and \"traditional\" political utilities of international law
based on colonial, national, imperial and, now, globalized systems of
law and power. Of course, since World War II, international law also has
been increasingly influenced by the mobilization of mass social
movements, initially organized around national and class interests but
more recently organized around other categories of identity such as
race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and other axes of
identification and regulation. n177 Thus, the emergence of \"civil
society\" at both the national and transnational levels has added
additional actors to the historical makers of international law. n178
More importantly, the emergence of social movements in this increasingly
globalized political setting has created an opening for the articulation
of antisubordination principles within the making of international law.
n179 Nonetheless[, the contemporary transnational status quo engendered
by this complex of forces slowly but surely has led to a \"neoliberal\"
conception of globalization and internationalization that effectively
demands a normative, political and legal preference for profit
over]{.underline} people, especially \"[surplus\" people]{.underline}.
As many observers have noted, this neoliberalization of
internationalized legal arrangements has promoted human rights mostly
for corporations. n180 [[Despite protest]{.mark}, critique and
resistance, [neoliberalism]{.mark}, in practice, [has amounted to
corporate globalization. This legacy]{.mark}]{.underline}, most recently
and ironically, [[is]{.mark} being [consolidated]{.mark} by
the]{.underline} \[\*1569\] \"[neoconservative\" construction of
globalization [under internationalized law]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some
observers say this neoconservative approach to law, transnationalism and
globalization aims to construct an imperial sovereign, or an \"imperial
sovereignty,\" to push for a nationalist international law. n181 Either
way, then, [the structural and material bottom line once again remains
constant: neoconservatism, like neoliberalism, is perfectly content with
a racialized yet colorblinded transnational system of law designed to
freeze tops and bottoms in the current global order precisely in their
traditional, neocolonial and subordinated/privileged
places]{.underline}. Thus, as it was in the beginning, [[international
law]{.mark} today [continues to be a racial]{.mark} and material
[project of the]{.mark} (white-identified) [Global North and West in
which the]{.mark} (colored) [Global South is the object of material
control and political rule. International law]{.mark}]{.underline}, like
domestic law, thereby [[protects]{.mark} the identitarian interests and
material legacies of [colonialism and imperialism in the name of
democracy and human rights.]{.mark} International law]{.underline}, like
domestic law, consequently is a project freighted with contradiction,
corruption, and complexity. Like domestic law, international law is a
recipe for brewing crisis for very similar reasons: both are constructed
and controlled by ruling neocolonial elites and their agents to proclaim
one thing but to do quite another. [In material and more concrete terms,
internationalized law is being used to produce a global identity-based
economic space]{.underline}, much like domestic law was used to produce
a national identity-based economic space; [much like domestic law has
been deployed to produce and prop up a national racial-capitalist class
hierarchy, international law is being used to produce and prop up a
transnational racial- capitalist class hierarchy]{.underline}. At both
levels, legalized injustice is a key hallmark of these socio-legal
regimes, which relentlessly commodify both the human species and its
habitats in the avowed name of \"liberty\" but in the actual interest of
those racialized, [neo-colonial elites who profit most directly from
today\'s version of \"free\" market fundamentalism. Thus, [contemporary
international law]{.mark} typically [protects]{.mark} the interests of
[capital over labor]{.mark}, of the corporation over the environment or
the community, of exploitation over sustainability]{.underline}. Like
traditional forms of domestic law, [it thereby effectively and
structurally elevates the interests of identity-based elites over
similarly identity-based masses]{.underline}. The non-stop chatter about
human rights for humans in peril oftentimes remains mostly just that:
chatter. No wonder, then, that [international law now is increasingly
characterized by the same dynamics of identitarian
contradiction]{.underline} under the rule of law that gave shape to
domestic law in centuries past. Both levels \[\*1570\] of law are based
on noble and inspiring specified values but applied by judicial
appointees and other legal actors in direct or indirect repudiation or
subversion of them; both are characterized by an overt commitment to
justice coupled with a covert sabotaging of that commitment. Like
domestic law, [[international law ensures]{.mark} racialized (and
gendered) [instability]{.mark}, [exploitation]{.mark},
[violence]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [inequality]{.mark}-all in the name of
colorblind development, security, freedom and justice]{.underline}. Like
domestic law, international law is [driven more by raw power and
\"traditional\" neocolonial identity politics than by principled or
colorblind justice]{.underline}. n182

Four centuries ago, somebody starving in the drought afflicted Elbe
region in what is today the Czech Republic, anonymously chiseled onto
the stone of the receding river bank a warning. Here, along the river
where one day American and Soviet troops would meet on their duel
approach to Berlin, a graffito made by unknown hand marks 1616 as the
oldest year recorded on one particular "Hunger Stone", and on that
surface there is a memento mori which reads "Wenn du mich sicht, dann
weine." This summer, among the hottest recorded, and the Elbe once again
receded to the point where observers could read that ominous missive:
"If you see me, weep." Something to tattoo on the brain with the Monday
release of the United Nations Intergovernmental Report on Climate
Change. Authored by 91 scientists, representing 40 countries and based
on over 6,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies, the conclusions of the
commission are horrifying. According to Coral Davenport at the New York
Times the climatologists discovered that if "greenhouse gas emissions
continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as
2.7 degrees Fahrenheit" by 2040, radically earlier than had been
thought, meaning that most readers of this article will bear witness to
"inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty." **[[A
child born today will have just turned the drinking age in a world
where]{.mark} close to all of the [coral reefs will be extinct]{.mark}
and where [massive storms like]{.mark} Hurricane Florence or Hurricane
[Maria]{.mark}, which has nearly destroyed a Puerto Rico abandoned by
the government of the United States, [will be common]{.mark}. Where the
social, cultural, and economic affects of climate change will be
recorded not on revealed hunger stones, but [in pandemics, wars,
famines, and genocides]{.mark} exacerbated by the effects of higher
temperatures.]{.underline}** Brandon Miller and Jay Croft at CNN write
that we'll see in starker detail the horrific results of industrial
man-made global warming earlier than in two decades, with the report
concluding that humanity has "only till 2030 to stem catastrophic
climate change." Alterations to human behavior which might hasten the
worst effects of climate change are technically possible, though the
study's authors doubt such change is politically feasible, as it would
require direct action on the part of the industrial economies of the
world, something with "no documented historic precedent." Myles Allen of
Oxford University explained that "we need to reverse emissions trends
and turn the world economy on a dime" if we're to stave off an
ecological apocalypse which we now understand isn't centuries in the
future, but rather mere decades, if not years. We already see the
effects in the increasing ferocity of storms, the droughts that mark not
just the developing world, but increasingly North America and Europe,
and in the wildfires, which have burnt their way across the west. As the
world's temperature rises we see an equivalent political slow burn,
nations increasingly moving toward the delusional reactionary
nationalisms as a means of punishing refugee populations often affected
either directly by climate change or by the civil strife made possible
by it, for as Mark Fishcetti describes the Syrian civil war in
Scientific American, "Human-induced drying in many societies can push
tensions over a threshold that provokes violent conflict" -- a reality
that if the Trump administration pretends to deny, has long been
acknowledged by the Pentagon. Climate change has resulted in
civilizational catastrophe before. Historian John Kelly notes in The
Great Mortality, his book on the Black Death of fourteenth-century
Europe, that pestilence was furthered by "climactic and ecological
instability," the bubonic plague encouraged by weakened immune systems
brought on by drought and famine. Polymathic anthropologist Jared
Diamond has considered how climate change brought collapse in cultures
as varied as the Anasazi and Maya or the medieval Norse settlements of
Greenland, writing that the "collapse of industrial civilization...
could assume various forms, such as the worldwide spread of diseases or
else of wars, triggered ultimately by scarcity of environmental
resources." Arguably the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia and the
Indus River Valley were felled by climate change, and one wonders if the
peasants of Sumer were as despondent as that German speaker on the Elbe
who asked future generations to weep, or if they were rather as myopic
as we are, saying of such changes that "This too shall pass" while what
expires is civilization itself? Humans are unable to imagine the actual
passing of their way of life. A sense that history changes has been
novel for most cultures, even apocalyptic minded ones, as medieval
paintings which depict Christ as a Flemish peasant or ancient Judeans as
Florentine nobleman can attest. The idea that the past was radically
different from the present and that tomorrow will be distant from today
is an innovation of Renaissance humanism and then modernity. Rather,
it's always been easier to imagine that your world will literally pass
into oblivion than that the values your civilization holds dear might
disappear (or need to disappear). During those lean times on the Indus
River, on the Euphrates, or the Elbe, women and men may have dreamt of
the end of days, but they couldn't have quite dreamt of us. The myths
that structured their world precluded it. Lest we be too arrogant, ours
is not so different a perspective, for as the literary theorist Frederic
Jameson famously noted, it is "easier to imagine the end of the world
than to imagine the end of capitalism." Similar for the hungry penitent
in the temple to all the gods of Sumer, or to the starving medieval
pilgrim who could envision the return of Christ, but not that he might
look different from those who populated his world. Limited perspective
is the wage of any totalizing ideology, and all eras are structured by
such paradigms. As a priest in Moloch's temple or a monk in a medieval
monastery had their religions, so have we ours, but the cracked gods of
our world differ in one important respect -- only capitalism's Mammon
has the capability of bringing about the apocalypse. **[Only capitalism
was able to inaugurate a new geological epoch in the Anthropocene;
unique is our dominant ideology's status in being able to obliterate all
of humanity. IPCC Co-Chair Debra Roberts said that the report is a "line
in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment
and we must act now," but what should disturb us most is the authors'
accurate alarm at the lack of political will to avert catastrophe. In
the United States the coal, oil, and gas industries' obfuscate, high
percentages of Americans believe the lie that climate change is a hoax
(while record heat affects the Midwest this October), and the Trump
administration trashes the Paris Accords.]{.underline}** Noam Chomsky
has said that the Republican "party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as
possible to destruction of organized human life. There is no historical
precedent for such a stand," with modern fascism directly correlated to
the increasing chaos of climate change itself. Roy Scranton in We're
Doomed. Now What? writes that as the "gap between the future we're
entering and the future we once imagined grows ever wider, nihilism
takes root in the shadow of our fear.... **[\[Y\]ou can see it in the
[pull to nationalism, sectarianism, war, and racial hatred]{.mark}. We
see it in the election of Donald Trump." What must be reckoned with is
how [this situation was directly engendered by industrial
capitalism]{.mark}, and [in particular by the]{.mark} partisans of its
[most extreme ideological manifestations of libertarianism and
neoliberalism]{.mark} who have provided cover for policies that have
enflamed the crisis. Past centuries were circumscribed by their
worldviews, be it medieval Catholicism, or classical Roman Augustan
paganism, or the varied gods of Sumer in ancient Mesopotamia. Even the
most visionary of individual perspectives must be limited by a culture's
dominant way of thinking, but while [our adherence to the market]{.mark}
is as all-encompassing as a Babylonian's loyalty to Marduk, it is only
our dark religion which actually [threatens Armageddon]{.mark}.
Unfettered, unregulated, capricious, [vampiric capitalism has brought us
to the brink]{.mark}, [and the mass inability to comprehend this]{.mark}
fact [evidences how ingrained said ideology is]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Our blinders are such that human tragedy that is attributable directly
to our economic system is often naturalized as simply being "The way
that things are," thus precluding even the possibility of different ways
of arranging our world. Deathdue to differing ideologies is always
interpreted as conscious and preventable, but capitalist tragedy is
simply understood as how life operates. Consideration of those who have
died because of capitalism (and those who will, which may yet include us
all) doesn't require a cover-up**[. So inured are we to seeing
capitalism as its own imposed ideology that we fail to understand its
death toll. Franco-Bulgarian philosopher Tzvetan Todorovwrote that
"remembrance of our own woes prevents us from seeing the suffering of
others," and while true, the converse is also accurate]{.underline}**.
While admitting that capitalism provided for unprecedented class
mobility and technological innovation, an honest consideration of its
death toll in any hypothetical Black Book of Capitalism would have to
include not just the obvious fatalities of those who died in industrial
accidents or whose lives were shortened by their labor, but indeed the
victims of colonialism, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and of fascismo
corporativo, which is simply capitalism driven to its horrifying end
Invisibility of such atrocities through normalization is a species of
what the philosopher Louis Althusser termed "interpellation," that is to
say that we're all molded subjects of the ideology that governs our
world so that we mostly hold uncritical assumptions about capitalism's
normativity. Writer William T. Vollmann addresses future generations in
his new tome on climate change Carbon Ideologies, explaining that "We
all lived for money, and that is what we died for." **[[As 2040
approaches our ignorance is]{.mark} a form of [collective
suicide.]{.mark} The Editorial Board of theWashington Post writes that
future "Historians will look in absolute astonishment" that not only did
our governments and corporate elite fail to halt climate change, but
that our policy makers "actually pushed in the wrong direction." That's
[assuming that there will even be any]{.mark} historians [left after the
climate change horseman of pestilence]{.mark}, famine, war, and death
gallop across the scorched and burning world, their riders named
"Deregulation," "Bottom Line," "Market," and "Profit." An August
environmental impact statement prepared by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration concedes that far from being a "Chinese hoax" as
Trump has alleged, the average temperature will rise seven degrees by
century's end. Quite a wide gulf between what the Trump administration
knows to be true and what his deluded believers will
swallow]{.underline}**. Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis, and Chris Mooney
at the Washington Post write that the Trump "administration did not
offer this dire forecast ... as part of an effort to combat climate
change," for their "analysis assumes the planet's fate is already
sealed**[." [Why prevent collapse when]{.mark} Trump concludes that
[there is]{.mark} still so much [money to be made]{.mark} in not
averting disaster? [This is the nightmare logic of scarcity
capitalism]{.mark}, the macabre calculus which is content to let
millions of people starve in the third world and that will ultimately
exterminate refugees who dare to escape a parched landscape, all [so
that the economic status quo can be maintained before the process kills
us all]{.mark}. The puritanism of corporate eco-individualism which
configures environmental protection as simply a matter of driving a
Prius or taking short showers is moral contrition or personal branding
rather than policy, a quasi-theological sacrifice before the altar of
the dying Earth. [What's]{.mark} actually [required is a massive,
international, eco-socialist mobilization of governments]{.mark} and
industries [that are responsible for this
calamity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Because right now capitalism's final
solution is nothing less than complete ecological collapse. In his 1888
autobiographical Ecce Homo, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche
eerily predicted that the 20th century would witness "wars as have never
happened on earth." With chaos brought about by the scarcity resulting
from climate change, we may reevaluate how prescient Nietzsche was about
the last century, realizing that he was perhaps actually off by a
hundred years.

The slogan also promotes the idea that the political powers-that-be---if
pressured by enough people---could scale back their military, stop
attacking other countries, and instead use the money for jobs,
education, and other social welfare programs at home. But that's not how
the system actually operates! [[Wars, invasions, and occupations are
not]{.mark} policies of one set of politicians or another, or [arbitrary
choices made by this or that president]{.mark}.]{.underline} At this
stage in history, [capitalism is a global system, with the U.S. the
world's most dominant capitalist-imperialist power, presiding over a
worldwide empire of exploitation. This [empire rests on the domination

essential to it]{.underline}, and to the U.S.'s overall global
dominance. [This is why]{.underline} the U.S. [rulers are
compelled]{.underline}---and willing [to---spend trillions on the
military, including during periods of severe economic and fiscal stress,
no matter who happens to sit in the White House or
Congress.]{.underline} This system of [global
capitalism]{.underline}-imperialism headed by the U.S. [is the main
source of the horrors that torment so many across the
globe---[from]{.mark} the [ethnic cleansing and slow genocide of the
Palestinian people]{.mark} by the U.S. and Israel, [to]{.mark} the [mass
incarceration]{.mark} and slow genocide [of Black people in the U.S.;
from the rape of the planet to the systematic degradation and violence
against women]{.mark}---here and around the world; from the extreme
deprivation and starvation faced by billions across the planet to the
growing poverty and desperation faced by millions in the
U.S.]{.underline} The [rulers]{.underline} in these imperial metropoles
[distribute some of the spoils of empire to provide a higher standard of
living than in the oppressed countries and buy social peace and loyalty
at home]{.underline} (which "Money for Jobs, Not For War" encourages).
People in the U.S. should reject that foul pact! The vast majority in
the U.S. have a profound interest in making common cause with oppressed
people worldwide, not in siding with "their" rulers. That means
fostering a morality that declares: "American lives are not more
important than other people's lives!"---not pandering to American
chauvinism, which strengthens the system responsible for so much misery.
It means people shouldn't appeal to those on the top to "spend more on
jobs," but to clearly and unequivocally demand a STOP to the horrors the
U.S. is committing around the world.

#### The alternative is to reject the aff as a mode of interrogation through Marxist IR theory -- Marxism is not a theory, it is a tool of critique that locates the historical contingency of phenomena -- the alternative closes the gap between Marxism and the political to enable revolutionary socialist praxis

to a Realist fate?" European Journal of International Relations 19(1)

The concept of the political exists as something repressed within
Marxist theorizing, something thought to be long since overcome that yet
persists in making its presence painfully felt. [[None of the leading
Marxist approaches]{.mark} extant [within IR has sought to subject the
political]{.mark} itself [to theory.]{.mark}]{.underline}25 Rather, it
appears as an element that is simply given, immediate. [[The
consequences can be read in the entanglement of Marxism]{.mark}, both as
theory and practice, [in]{.mark} the historical fate prescribed by
[Realism]{.mark}, the perdurable fragmentation and anarchy of
international politics.]{.underline} This failure to inquire into the
meaning and significance of the political is referable back to the
ambivalence of Marx's own theoretical practice. On the one hand, 'Marx
consigned the whole sphere of politics to ideology' (Adorno, 2000: 143).
There is a moment of world-historical freedom, not to be discarded, in
this brusquely achieved rupture. The hardened surface of the social is
broken through: no longer is society to be entranced and deluded, in its
self-understanding, by forms of appearance: politics, law, religion and
philosophy. Politics is not, any more than any of the others, to be
hypostasized into something existing in-itself, something autonomous and
self-sufficient, something ontological. Rather, it receives all its
substance and contents from elsewhere, from the societally mediated
process of the interaction of humans with nature: In the whole
conception of history up to the present this real basis of history has
either been totally neglected or else considered as a minor matter quite
irrelevant to the course of history. History must, therefore, always be
written according to an extraneous standard; the real production of life
seems to be primeval history, while the truly historical appears to be
separated from ordinary life, something extra-superterrestrial. With
this the relation of man to nature is excluded from history and hence
the antithesis of nature and history is created. The exponents of this
conception of history have consequently only been able to see in history
the political actions of princes and States, religious and all sorts of
theoretical struggles. (Marx and Engels, 1968: 51) [Marx's historical
materialism, dedicated to the primacy of the economic as the mode of
society's self-reproduction, had in the mid-19th century, and continues
to have, a decisively progressive aspect: the founders of historical
materialism 'wished for the revolution as one of the economic
relationships in society as a whole, in the fundament of its
self-preservation, not as the changing of the ground-rules of
domination, its political form']{.underline} (Adorno, 2001: 'Antagonism
contingent?'). [Only such a change in the basis of society's existence
could bring about the world-historical transformation that Marx and
Engels hoped for, the break from pre-history.]{.underline} The failure
of the revolution of 1848 surely impressed upon Marx the necessity of a
better theoretical grasp of the essence of society: the
decades-researched, never completed study of political economy seeks
precisely to lay bare how it is that modern society actually reproduces
itself, what form the interaction with nature takes in capitalist
society, what it means that the object is a commodity. Yet, [[at the
same time that the]{.mark} ideological [appearance of politics is
stripped away]{.mark} by devastating criticism, [the political itself is
left standing]{.mark}; the content of politics is revealed as arising
out of the antagonistic nature of society's mode of reproduction, the
organization of the exploitation of nature, but the form of the
political, the space in which politics takes place,]{.underline}26 [is
not subjected to critique.]{.underline} [If politics is seen through as
appearance, [it]{.mark} is nevertheless not explained how the societal
process of the productive interaction with nature generates the
distinctive form of the political that Realism insists upon --- its
delimitation and, on the global level, fractured, multiple
existence.]{.underline} The critique of political economy can be
considered a quasi-transcendental account of economics --- What are the
conditions of possibility for such a thing as an 'economy' to exist at
all? --- but no such radical questioning is brought to bear on the
political element: it is not explained why economics is political
economy. So the political itself remains obscure, unillumined by the
light of critique, with the result that the relationship between the
categories derived from the critique of the societal production process
and the political existence of humans remains unarticulated.
Paradigmatically, [in the Communist Manifesto [Marx and Engels write
both that 'the working men have no country']{.mark}]{.underline} (2002:
241) [[and that 'the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie
is]{.mark} at first [a national struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters
with its own bourgeoisie' (2002: 232). [[The proletariat]{.mark} both
[transcends the national context and yet is bound to it i]{.mark}n a
relationship that is never properly explicated. ']{.underline}Since the
proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to
be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation,
it is, so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the
word' (Marx and Engels, 2002: 241; emphasis in original). But in what
sense of the word? [[The nation,]{.mark} the modern political community,
[remains]{.mark} in Marx's thought [the scene of the drama]{.mark} even
[despite]{.mark} the sublation of [the class
struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline} The form of the political is to be filled
with a radically different content, but it is never made clear whether
or how this revolutionary change of content itself changes the nature of
the form.27 Consequently, despite being roughly negated (at least as
high politics), [[the politica]{.mark}l continually [recurs throughout
Marx's oeuvre in a]{.mark} theoretically [undigested way as marking out
the space within which revolutionary activity is to take
place]{.mark}]{.underline}, from the early critical works motivated by
the experience of German backwardness in relation to Britain and France,
through the texts on the failure of revolutionary struggle in France, to
the late Critique of the Gotha Programme and documents for the First
International. **[[The contradiction of internationalism and national
revolution remains]{.mark} latent and unresolved, indeed
[unacknowledged.]{.mark}]{.underline}**28 This ambivalence towards the
political, its simultaneous negation and retention, is preserved within
the Marxist tradition right through to the various strands of Marxism
within contemporary IR. The World-Systems theorists and Political
Marxists, for instance, are at an extreme in their refusal to grant any
theoretical substance to the specificity of the political, to how and
why a bounded political space is created, and yet the political is
continually and massively present within their work, at least at a brute
empirical level --- how could it not be, when their studies are entirely
devoted to analysing the differential development of political
communities within the growth of capitalism? The same is true generally
of Marxism within IR: the political is always there (necessarily, given
that so much of IR Marxism takes the form of historical-sociological
studies) but almost invariably as an unacknowledged element, something
regarded as unproblematic, something not worked through theoretically.
Where Marxist historical sociology has broached the question of the
political (Rosenberg, 2010), it has been unable to grasp it
conceptually; and where, exceptionally, Marxism has attempted a
conceptual treatment (Bromley, 2010),29 it has effectively conceded to
Realist political fragmentation: 'In respect of political order ... the
Humean predicament is the human predicament' (Bromley, 2010: 245). But,
[[as a theory of freedom, Marxism cannot afford such a
concession;]{.mark} for it is precisely [the form of the
political]{.mark} that [Realism says creates the anarchic]{.mark},
[unchanging]{.mark} and essentially [conflictual arena of the
international]{.mark}, and [which forces each community into the
fatality of the unending struggle for self-preservation]{.mark} that is
the condition [of international politics.]{.mark}]{.underline}30 If this
deficiency within Marxist thought concerning political form is traceable
back to Marx's own thinking, then [[the solution to the problem]{.mark}
of the political [is not]{.mark} to be [straightforwardly found within
the Marxian corpus.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It is necessary]{.mark},
instead, [for Marxism in IR to extend]{.mark} its reach [beyond]{.mark}
the prevailing interest in [historical-sociological studies of
processes]{.mark} of development [and to engage critically with]{.mark}
the tradition of political theory]{.underline}:31 **[above all, with
such central categories as [sovereignty and legal
order.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The model for such an engagement remains,
nevertheless, the manner of Marx's own approach to bourgeois political
economy: [he neither rejected the categories developed by classical
political economy in favour of a 'socialist' alternative, nor did he
simply accept them at face value.]{.underline} Rather, [[he interrogated
them in such depth, exposing their]{.mark} social [mediatedness, as to
demonstrate that the political economists did not understand their own
concepts.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[It is through this labour of
conceptual investigation that Marx broke the naturalization of]{.mark}
the categories of [bourgeois society]{.mark} characteristic of political
economy.]{.underline}**32 **[[This, also, is the way to escape Realist
essentializing in IR.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Just as Marx's theory of
capital implies the question of how a society, indeed a world, of
generalized exchange is possible, how it is that humans could totalize
exchange such that every object becomes a commodity, an economic thing,
so, [[in IR, the problem of the political demands investigation into how
humans could make themselves 'sovereign',]{.mark} an autonomous source
of law, [and how the world could be transformed into political
space.]{.mark}]{.underline} The premise of Marx's theoretical
investigations is that [[it is necessary to understand]{.mark} the being
of [capitalist society]{.mark}, what it actually is, [if it is to be
transcended]{.mark}: only through investigating the conditions of
possibility of the society ruled by value does it become possible to
think what might be beyond universal commodity exchange.]{.underline}
Analogously, [for Marxist thinking in IR, **it [is only through
interrogating]{.mark} the fundamental [categories of political
thought,]{.mark} exposing what is involved in their constitution, [that
it might be possible to think beyond the delimited,]{.mark}
particularist [form of the political]{.mark} naturalized by Realism,
[and to escape entrapment in the fateful condition of the
international.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Bio Securitization

#### **The affirmative's invocation of bioterrorism enables a form of biosecuritization that enables both medical surveillance and the rapid consumption of information and technology, focused solely on profit, further enabling the neoliberal hellscape that is the healthcare industry**

**Fisher and Monahan 10** (Jill A. Fisher, Torin Monahan, 27th November
2010, "The 'Biosecuritization' of Healthcare Delivery: Examples of Post
9/11 Technological Imperatives", Social Science and Medicine 72, Pages

[In contrast, the paradigm of biomedicalization shifts emphasis away
from treating patients' illnesses to providing services for
consumers.]{.underline} Clarke et al. (2003) have referred to it as the
"Biomedical TechnoService Complex, Inc." in their in-depth exploration
of the characteristics of biomedicalization[. Marking 1985 as the
beginning of biomedicalization, they describe this transformation in
terms of medicine's colonization and commodification of health and
concomitant expansions in the political economy of healthcare sectors. A
key component of biomedicalization is the increased surveillance of
health and risk behaviors in order to prevent, postpone, or manage
serious illness (Clarke et al., 2003). While this surveillance is often
represented within popular culture as both lifeand cost-saving, Mechanic
(2002) reminds us that preventive medicine and health-promoting care are
not always cost-saving at the aggregate level. This is often the case
for breast and prostate cancer screening, which frequently includes
individuals with low risk profiles, so the chance of detecting single
cases of cancer is quite low at a significant cost. Biomedicalization,
however, is not about costsaving; rather it is about profit-generating.
Seen from this perspective, the high cost of diagnostic tests and
procedures that are conducted in the name of health promotion should be
no surprise because the purpose of this mode of medicine does not serve
to cut total healthcare expenditures but to create and profit from new
markets]{.underline}. Likewise, the many so-called "lifestyle"
pharmaceutical products that have been developed for cholesterol,
insomnia, and anxiety/depression are designed to alleviate symptoms only
while patients consume them and so need to be consumed long-term (Dumit,
2002). [The technological imperative within biomedicalization can thus
be understood in terms of the expansion of healthcare markets to
products and services for healthy consumers and for longterm use by
patient populations.]{.underline} "Medical progress" within this frame
becomes defined by and measured in terms of consumption: the number of
individuals subscribing to treatment and prevention regimens and
accessing illness-prevention and health-promotion services. [Developing
upon Clarke et al's. (2003) framing of biomedicalization, we identify
biosecuritization as a type of technological imperative operating within
the "Biomedical TechnoService Complex, Inc." and transforming U.S.
healthcare infrastructures. A key component of the biomedicalization
paradigm is the redefinition of who is a consumer and what products are
available for consumption.]{.underline} [In its biosecuritization mode,
this manifests as massive investments in information and communication
technologies. The term biosecurity is often mobilized as a response to
perceived risks of contagion from biological agents, with an emphasis on
risks introduced by bioterrorism, even if such a focus occludes more
mundane threats to biosecurity (Collier, Lakoff, Rabinow, 2004; Cooper,
2006; Lentzos, 2006; Vogel, 2008]{.underline}). Nonetheless, within the
context of healthcare delivery, biosecuritization draws upon the
dominant national-security frame of emergency preparedness to alter
organizational practices and priorities in interesting and complex ways.
[Rather than having its orientation toward the provision of services to
patients, biosecuritization targets hospitals and other healthcare
organizations to consume information, communication, and security
technologies]{.underline}. While much media attention has focused on
federal, state, and local efforts to stockpile supplies and medications
for pandemic flu outbreaks, less public are the infrastructural
investments that have received high priority, from software applications
such as FluSurge 2.0, distributed by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (DHHS), to advanced monitoring systems designed to detect
exposure patterns of infection (Radonovich, Magalian, Hollingsworth, &
Baracco, 2009; Thuemmler, Buchanan, Fekri, & Lawson, 2009). Some of
these systems are purported to enable more efficient distribution of
services to patients in emergency situations while others are designed
to help triage or manage the location and condition of patients (Curtis
et al., 2008). [As media coverage of outbreaks of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian flu (H5N1), and most recently swine
flu (H1N1) spreads fear about the presumed scale of contagion (Davis,
2005; Lakoff & Collier, 2008), what get eclipsed are the relative risks
of these "new" viruses in relation to the risks of more quotidian
illnesses, especially in terms of the strains they create on the
healthcare system. In other words, hospitals are urged to consume
technologies for low-probability disaster situations as part of a
security discourse that privileges the spectacular or exceptional cases
of mortality and morbidity in healthcare]{.underline}. On one hand,
these investments turn cost-benefit calculations on their head because
the systems tend to be expensive and have little benefit for routine
practices and procedures. On the other, these investments illustrate the
extent to which a new type of technological imperative is operating
within healthcare settings. [Even without occasion to be used to manage
catastrophes, technologies within this domain offer significant symbolic
value because of the promise they provide for the public's health and
safety, and this type of value often prompts investment in them (TFAH,
2007). The media, federal government, technology vendors, and the
hospital rankings published by the American Hospital Association all
contribute to the urgency that hospital administrators might feel to
adopt these technologies.]{.underline} More than this, however, is that
these technological systems often provide tangible resources for
hospital administrators. Rather than seeing these technologies as having
primary uses in emergency situations, it is instead possible e and
likely preferable e to view these technologies in terms of the
managerial tools they offer administrators. [Just as systems can be used
to track infection vectors, those same systems can also be used on a
daily basis to monitor the workflow of hospital personnel, including
nurses, physicians, and custodial staff, and to discipline or reward
according to performance (Fisher, 2006; Fisher & Monahan,
2008).]{.underline} [In other words, the biosecuritization modality of
biomedicine leads to the framing of "medical progress" as the
"rationalization" of organizations through technological monitoring,
which aims to promote accountability and new forms of responsibilization
of healthcare workers]{.underline}. With biosecuritization, the benefits
of technological change are not as easily felt by patients or providers
as they are by hospital administrators. In the social sciences,
empirical case studies of medicalization and biomedicalization have
provided analytic insights into the complex manifestations of these
phenomena in healthcare settings (Clarke, Mamo, Fosket, Fishman, & Shim,
2010; Conrad, 2007; Klawiter, 2008; Mamo, 2007; Sullivan & Weitz, 1988).
In contrast, there has been little work to date exploring the process of
biosecuritization of healthcare (e.g., King, 2003, 2005; Lakoff &
Collier, 2008), and as a result, media portrayals dominate, providing
inadequate critical appraisal of the trends. This paper serves as a
partial corrective by illustrating some of the ways in which security
discourses are used to justify the implementation of identification and
tracking technologies in U.S. hospitals.

#### **The impact is controlling surveillance in hospitals reinforcing hierarchical control**

**Fisher and Monahan 10** (Jill A. Fisher, Torin Monahan, 27th November

Workflow management represents the second key area for the use of
identification and tracking systems in hospitals. Some hospital
administrators engage in this activity by requiring hospital staff (and
increasingly patients) to wear RTLS tags that will transmit
identification, location, movement, and proximity data to a central
computer system by means of detectors installed within specific
departments or throughout the facility. [As might be expected, those
employees with lower professional status, such as nurses and clerks, are
much more likely to be tracked in this way than are those with higher
status, such as physicians and administrators]{.underline}. Workflow
management regimes of this sort reinscribe the rational control of
Taylorism, replete with "efficiency studies" for the reduction of staff
labor and the reduction of staff (Taylor, 1911). [Through such
information systems, administrators hope to identify objectively
"bottlenecks" in the coordination and execution of care-giving
activities and to take decisive action, such as retraining, redeploying,
**or eliminating staff,** to contend with what they perceive to be
inefficiencies in the system]{.underline}. As one hospital administrator
succinctly stated in an interview: "If you can measure it, you can
manage it." [Therefore, one goal is to use these systems to translate
all hospital activities into discrete, measurable units that can be
soberly managed from afar.]{.underline} Elsewhere we have called
attention to the power dynamics and surveillance potentials of hospital
systems for inventory tracking and workflow management (Fisher, 2006;
Fisher & Monahan, 2008; Monahan & Fisher, 2008[). Namely, such systems
tend to intensify labor and add additional responsibilities for nursing
staff who lose degrees of control over their workplaces when
administrators implement RTLS.]{.underline} Whereas typical hospital
settings allow for complex social arrangements with nursing staff often
stashing and sharing equipment as needed, inventory management systems
seek to circumvent existing hospital cultures by establishingdor
reassertingdtop-down control over departments. Moreover, lowlevel staff
are often tasked with the data-entry, tag management, and equipment
roundup activities of RTLS, which may reduce some of the labor
associated with finding items e or what administrators disparagingly
refer to as "hunting and gathering" e but also add additional work in
the form of responding to alarms, replacing batteries in tags, adding
new inventory into the database, and so forth. [Although, in interviews,
administrators state that they are not interested in tapping the "Big
Brother" capabilities of these systems, informants have communicated to
us telling examples of people being disciplined and fired because RTLS
data proved that they were taking breaks when they were not supposed to
or were lying about their locations. Thus, it is not all that surprising
that some nursing staff are reluctant to wear location tags and that
some have even sabotaged the systems (Fisher, 2006). Identification and
tracking systems clearly lend themselves to surveillance and control
functions. Instead of approximating any totalizing or panoptic form of
discipline (Foucault, 1977), however, the ad-hoc and partial deployment
of RTLS, coupled with material and cultural constraints, attenuate overt
surveillance uses.]{.underline}

### China Engagement

**Engagement with China is hijacked by neoliberal forces to expand
global capitalism**

**Roden 3** (Mark, Sept, "US--China Relations in the Contemporary Era:
An International Political Economy Perspective", Politics September,
vol. 23 no. 3 192-199, Url:
http://pol.sagepub.com.libproxy.scu.edu/content/23/3/192.short)

Based on the above Bill Clinton should be regarded as an enormously
successful president. By 1996 the national deficit had been brought to
its lowest ebb in over a decade and US economic power was in the
ascension fuelled by export-led growth (Walker, 1996, p. 350). Michael
Cox has forcefully argued that Clinton detractors largely ignored the
administration\'s switch of emphasis 'from geo-politics to
geo-economics' (M. Cox, 1995). Moreover**[, [US ideological power waxed
rather than waned]{.mark} during the Clinton years. [Governments across
the globe followed the US]{.mark} lead [in lowering trade barriers and
adapting themselves to]{.mark} the competitive exigencies of
[globalisation in its neoliberal form -- namely deregulation and
enhancing]{.mark} the rights of [global capital]{.mark}]{.underline}**
vis-à-vis nationally based labour. This trend was compounded by the
formation of key institutions integral to an overall policy of promoting
free market policies throughout the world. Most significantly, the
Clinton administration secured the passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994; the 1995 agreement of the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation (APEC) to develop a free trade zone; and, also in
1995, the formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The important
point here was that the institutionalisation of US power at the regional
and global levels harnessed what were ostensibly competitor economies
(such as those of Japan, Germany, and to some extent China) to economic
ideas emanating from Washington. It would be wrong to see the promotion
of liberal free trade policies in solely negative terms. There were
positive aspects. Firstly, the US was engaged in the world and stressing
the role of trade and investment in overcoming historical conflicts. As
Michael Cox has cogently argued Clinton\'s involvement in the Northern
Ireland peace process was a crucial element in persuading the formerly
Marxist Irish Republican Army (IRA) to end that conflict (M. Cox, 1998).
Part and parcel of Clinton\'s free trade policies has been that of
fostering socio-economic stability and conditions conducive to the free
flow of capital, goods and services. This has had a progressive impact
beyond furthering US interests alone. The Clinton years, though driven
by economic liberalism and a large dose of 'enlightened' self-interest,
were also informed by a renewed belief in multilateral institutions and
internationalism (Ruggie, 1996). A crucial question in creating a new
global economic order and legitimating US leadership in the Clinton era,
however, was how to bring China within the institutional framework of
the post-Cold War world order while also maximising the opportunities
for US firms in a huge emerging market. Previous Section Next Section
The IPE of US--China relations in the Clinton era The Clinton
administration\'s overall approach was to bring China within the family
of nations assenting to liberal norms. Moreover, despite coming to power
castigating George Bush Senior\'s Republican administration for
'coddling' dictators, the IPE of US--China relations were played out in
correlation with key structural goals that placed liberal economics
above the promotion of liberal politics (Hughes, 1995). Gerard Segal has
dubbed the US approach 'positive conditionality' -- a useful turn of
phrase that connotes China\'s gaining access to trade benefits in return
for system-maintaining behaviour (Segal, 1995, p. 71). It was in the
light of this strategy that the Clinton administration jettisoned its
initial China policy of tying China\'s Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status
to progress on human rights. Linkage, as this policy was known, came to
be seen as a harmful impediment to US firms and was further viewed as
undercutting the overriding logic of policies pursued by key economic
agencies such as the Department of the Treasury, the Office of the
United States Trade Representative (USTR), and the Commerce Department.
Indeed, intense bureaucratic rivalries surfaced during Clinton\'s first
term as the administration moved to replace 'linkage' with a policy of
'comprehensive engagement' in May 1994. The new priority given to
geoeconomics was polarised by the administration\'s decision to give
unequivocal support to the annual renewal of China\'s MFN trade status
when voted upon by the US congress. Moreover, the role of the State
Department was noticeably downgraded as were protectionist arguments
(from both left and right) fuelled by the seemingly intractable trade
deficit that existed between the two countries (Lampton, 1994). The
intellectual argument for engaging China was perhaps best articulated by
Laura D\'Andrea Tyson who claimed that congressional revocation of MFN
would 'slow the flow of information about Western culture, ideas,
business practices, and perspectives that accompany foreign investment'
(Wall Street Journal, 28 May 1997). **[[The case for the engagement of
China was also the result]{.mark}, however[, of established economic
forces within the US state. Extensive]{.mark} and highly organised
[lobbying by business groups took full advantage of the fact that their
opponents]{.mark} on the left and right [were
fragmented]{.mark}]{.underline}** and offering unattractive
alternatives. In 1991 around 75 prominent US trade groups formed the
Business Coalition for US--China Trade, whose members included lobbying
giants such as the US Chamber of Commerce, the US--China Business
Council and the 500-member strong National Foreign Trade Council
(Sutter, 1998, p. 57). **[[These groups were particularly visible
during]{.mark} the 1994 [deliberations over]{.mark} delinking MFN from
[human rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example the Emergency
Committee for American Trade (ECAT) (representing 55 large US
corporations with worldwide sales of \$55 trillion in 1992) was
instrumental in the sending of an open letter to the Clinton
administration from 300 captains of industry and business (Sutter, 1998,
p. 58). From 1994 to 2000 an agglomeration of US business groups,
pro-engagement members of Congress and administration officials
successfully ensured that MFN was renewed annually. This occurred
despite the often animated protestations of human rights lobbyists and
protectionists. The IPE of US--China relations during the Clinton
administrations revolved primarily around two fundamental issues. The
first was the bilateral trade deficit. The second was China\'s accession
to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Previous Section Next Section The
trade deficit The US--China trade deficit, though real, has been
politicised in a way that falsely portrays China as protectionist and
belligerent in her approach to free trade. **[[It is therefore]{.mark}
highly [significant that key neoliberal scholars have actually applauded
China\'s gradualist approach to reform]{.mark},]{.underline}** having
witnessed events in the former Soviet Union (Overholt, 1993; Lardy,
1994). As Nicholas Lardy points out, the deficit (which stood at \$80
billion in 2001) does not represent a Chinese ploy to take advantage of
the world trade system but something altogether more benign. The deficit
is structural and reflects changes in the positions of the Newly
Industrialising Countries (NICs) in Asia taken as a whole. Thus although
China\'s share of world exports in clothing, toys, sporting goods and
footwear rose from 14 per cent in 1984 to 39 per cent in 1994, the share
in these sectors simultaneously fell in the four Asian Tiger economies
(Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea) from 55 per cent to 24 per
cent. In short China has merely filled the vacuum left by other Asian
nations that have moved into high-technology sectors (Lardy, 1998, p.
188). According to Robert Ross, 'the cumulative US trade deficit with
China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan has not appreciably
grown since 1998; only the distribution among the markets has changed'
(Ross, 1997, p. 48). Moreover, China\'s trade deficit with the US has
also reflected the realities of consumer demand in the US where
low-value-added goods, manufactured largely in China, have been
necessary imports since the 1980s. The US economy had long since moved
away from the mass production of toys, plastics and footwear (Lardy,
1994). Thus it was argued that the deficit should not preclude China\'s
entry to the WTO. Previous Section Next Section The World Trade
Organisation As a number of observers of US--China relations have noted,
China has largely acquiesced in the role of global institutions since
the end of the Cultural Revolution (Foot, 1995; Cheung, 1998).
**[[Despite protracted negotiations]{.mark} (beginning in 1986) [over
China\'s entry to]{.mark} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
and then [the WTO, China has been admitted]{.mark} to the latter [on
terms largely congruent with neoliberal]{.mark} policy
[goals]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Conditions for China\'s entry to the WTO
were agreed upon on 15 November 1999. Despite US approval these
conditions were initially subject to bilateral agreements between China
and Canada and China and the European Union. A six year phase-in period
was approved by the US and involves the following: 'China\'s agreement
to cut duties on a wide range of products; to give foreign companies the
right to distribute products within China; and to allow foreign car
makers to provide car financing. Most significantly, in terms of
US--China relations, general tariffs will be cut between 14.5 per cent
and 15 per cent while new sectors of the Chinese economy, such as
banking, insurance, the Internet, telecoms, and electronics will be
opened to the forces of global competition' (Far Eastern Economic
Review, 25 November 1999). Significantly, since 1999 pro-business and
pro-Chinese forces within the lobbying world and within the US Congress
have been pushing for an end to the yearly debate over MFN, urging the
approval of a Permanent Normal Trade Relations Act (PNTA). In June 2001
this Act was passed with the approval of George W. Bush\'s Republican
administration. **[[This further 'normalisation' of US--China
relations,]{.mark} in correlation with China\'s entry to the WTO,
[suggests that both nations are moving ever closer in their mutual
recognition of the neoliberal ideas underpinning
globalisation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, the claim that the two
countries represent diametrically opposed civilisations heading for
imminent collision appears rather premature if not entirely spurious.1
This point has been underscored in recent times by the reactions of
Chinese president Jiang Zemin and George W. Bush to the terrorist
attacks of September 11 and their joint resolve to ensure a stable
global order.

### Econ Collapse

#### Economic threat predictions are the driving force behind imperialist interventions\-\--link turns the whole case and empirically kills millions

**Neocleous,** Prof of Gov, **8** \[Mark Neocleous, Prof. of Government
@ Brunel, *Critique of Security*, p95-100\]

In other words, [the new international order moved very quickly to
reassert the connection between economic and national
security]{.underline}: the commitment to the former was simultaneously a
commitment to the latter, and vice versa. As the doctrine of national
security was being born, [the major player on the international stage
would aim to use perhaps its most important power of all -- its economic
strength -- in order to re-order the world. And this re-ordering was
conducted through the idea of 'economic security'.9]{.underline}9
Despite the fact that 'econ omic security' would never be formally
deﬁned beyond 'economic order' or 'economic well-being',100 the
signiﬁcant conceptual con sistency between economic security and liberal
order-building also had a strategic ideological role. By playing on
notions of 'economic well-being', economic security seemed to emphasise
economic and thus'human' needs over military ones. [The reshaping of
global capital, international order and the exercise of state power
could thus look decidedly liberal and 'humanitarian'. This appearance
helped **co-opt the liberal Left into the process**]{.underline} and, of
course, played on individual desire for personal security by using
notions such as 'personal freedom' and'social equality'.101 Marx and
Engels once highlighted the historical role of the bour geoisie in
shaping the world according to its own interests. The need of a
constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over
the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle
everywhere, establish connections everywhere . . . It compels all
nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of
production; it compels them . . . to become bourgeois in themselves. In
one word, it creates a world after its own image.102 In the second half
of the twentieth century [this ability to 'batter down all Chinese
walls' would still rest heavily on the logic of capital, but would also
come about in part under the guise of security. The whole worldbecame a
garden to be cultivated -- to be recast according to the logic of
security]{.underline}. In the space of ﬁfteen years the concept
'[economic security']{.underline} had [moved]{.underline} from connoting
insurance policies for working people [to]{.underline} the desire to
shape the world in a capitalist fashion -- and back again. In fact, it
has constantly shifted between these registers ever since, [being used
for the constant reshaping of world order and resulting in a
comprehensive level of intervention and policing all over the
globe]{.underline}. Global order has come to be fabricated and
administered according to a security doctrine underpinned by the logic
of capitalaccumulation and a bourgeois conception of order. By
incorporating within it a particular vision of economic order, the
concept of national security implies the interrelatedness of so many
different social, econ omic, political and military factors that more or
less any development anywhere can be said to impact on liberal order in
general and America's core interests in particular. Not only could
bourgeois Europe be recast around the regime of capital, but so too
could the whole international order as capital not only nestled, settled
and established connections, but also'secured' everywhere. [Security
politics thereby became the basis of a distinctly liberal philosophy of
global 'intervention', fusing global issues of economic management with
domestic policy formations in an ambitious and frequently violent
strategy**.**]{.underline} Here lies the Janus-faced character of
American foreign policy.103 One face is the 'good liberal cop':
friendly, prosperous and democratic, sending money and help around the
globe when problems emerge, so that the world's nations are shown how
they can alleviate their misery and perhaps even enjoy some prosperity.
The other face is the 'bad liberal cop': should one of these nations
decide, either through parliamentary procedure, demands for
self-determination or violent revolution to address its own social
problems in ways that conﬂict with the interests of capital and the
bourgeois concept of liberty, then the authoritarian dimension of
liberalism shows its face; [the 'liberal moment' becomes the moment of
violence]{.underline}. This Janus-faced character has meant that through
the mandate of security the US, as the national security state par
excellence, has seen ﬁt to either overtly or covertly re-order the
affairs of myriads of nations -- those 'rogue' or 'outlaw' states on the
'wrong side of history'.104 'Extrapolating the ﬁgures as best we can',
one CIA agent com mented in 1991,'[there have been about 3,000 major
covert operations and over 10,000 minor operations]{.underline} -- all
illegal, and all [designed to disrupt, destabilize, or modify the
activities of other countries']{.underline}, adding that '[every covert
operation has been rationalized in terms of U.S. national
security'.]{.underline}105 These would include 'interventions' in
Greece, Italy, France, Turkey, Macedonia, the Ukraine, Cambodia,
Indonesia, China, Korea, Burma, Vietnam, Thailand, Ecuador, Chile,
Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
Uruguay, Bolivia, Grenada, Paraguay, Nicaragua, El Salvador, the
Philippines, Honduras, Haiti, Venezuela, Panama, Angola, Ghana, Congo,
South Africa, Albania, Lebanon, Grenada, Libya, Somalia, Ethiopia,
Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and many more, and many of these more than
once. Next up are the '60 or more' countries identiﬁed as the bases of
'terror cells' by Bush in a speech on 1 June 2002.106 [The methods used
have varied: most popular has been the favoured technique of liberal
security -- 'making the economy scream' via controls, interventions and
the imposition of neo-liberal regulations. But a wide range of other
techniques have been used: terror bombing; subversion; rigging
elections; the use of the CIA's 'Health Alteration Committee' whose
mandate was to 'incapacitate' foreign ofﬁcials; drug-trafﬁcking;107 and
the sponsorship of terror groups, counterinsurgency agencies, death
squads. Unsurprisingly, some plain old fascist groups and parties have
been co- opted into the project, from the attempt at reviving the
remnants of the Nazi collaborationist Vlasov Army for use against the
USSR to the use of fascist forces to undermine democratically elected
governments, such as in Chile]{.underline}; indeed, one of the reasons
[fascism ﬂowed into Latin America]{.underline} was [because of the
ideology of national security]{.underline}.108 Concomitantly, 'national
security' has meant a policy of non-intervention where satisfactory
'security partnerships' could be established with certain authoritarian
and military regimes: Spain under Franco, the Greek junta, Chile, Iraq,
Iran, Korea, Indonesia, Cambodia, Taiwan, South Vietnam, the
Philippines, Turkey, the ﬁve Central Asian republics that emerged with
the break-up of the USSR, and China. [Either way, the whole world was to
be included in the new'secure' global liberal order]{.underline}. [The
result has been the slaughter of untold numbers]{.underline}. John Stock
well, who was part of a CIA project in Angola which led to the deaths of
over 20,000 people, puts it like this: Coming to grips with these
U.S./CIA activities in broad numbers and ﬁguring out how many people
have been killed in the jungles of Laos or the hills of Nicaragua is
very difﬁcult. But, adding them up as best we can, [we come up with a
ﬁgure of six million people killed -- and this is a minimum
ﬁgure]{.underline}. Included are: one million killed in the Korean War,
two million killed in the Vietnam War, 800,000 killed in Indonesia, one
million in Cambodia, 20,000 killed in Angola -- the operation I was part
of -- and 22,000 killed in Nicaragua.109 [Note that the six million is a
minimum ﬁgure, that he omits to mention rather a lot of other
interventions, and that he was writing in 1991. This is security as the
slaughter bench of history]{.underline}. All of this has been more than
conﬁrmed by events in the twentyﬁrst century: in a speech on 1 June
2002, which became the basis of the ofﬁcial National Security Strategy
of the United Statesin September of that year, President [Bush
reiterated that the US has a unilateral right to overthrow any
government in the world, and launched a new round of slaughtering to
prove it.]{.underline} While much has been made about the supposedly
'new' doctrine of preemption in the early twenty-ﬁrst century, the
policy of preemption has a long history as part of national security
doctrine. [The United States has long maintained the option of
pre-emptive actions to counter a sufﬁcient threat to our national
security. The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of
inaction]{.underline} -- and the more compelling the case for taking
anticipatory action to defend ourselves . . . To forestall or prevent
such hostile acts by our adver saries, the United States will, if
necessary, act pre emptively.110 [In other words, the security policy of
the world's only superpower in its current 'war on terror' is still
underpinned by a notion of liberal order-building based on a certain
vision of 'economic order']{.underline}. The National Security Strategy
concerns itself with a 'single sustainable model for national success'
based on 'political and economic liberty', with whole sections devoted
to the security beneﬁts of 'economic liberty', and the beneﬁts to
liberty of the security strategy proposed.111

### Environment

#### The attempts at simple policy change are too late -- We need to reorient the structures that allow the consequences of climate change to form in the first place. 

**McDufff 19**, Phil, "Ending climate change requires the end of
capitalism. Have we got the stomach for it?",
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/ending-climate-change-end-capitalism

[Climate change activism is increasingly the domain of the
young,]{.underline} such as 16-year-old [Greta
Thunberg](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant),
the unlikely face of the [school strike for climate
movement](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/school-climate-strike-greta-thunberg),
which has seen many thousands of children walk out of school to demand
that their parents' generation takes responsibility for leaving them a
planet to live on[. [In comparison, the existing political establishment
looks more and more like an impediment to change. The consequences of
global warming have moved from the merely theoretical and predicted to
observable reality over the past few years, but this has not been
matched by an uptick in urgency. The need to keep the wheels of
capitalism well-oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires,
floods and hurricanes. Today's children, as they become more politically
aware, will be much more radical than their parents, simply because
there will be no other choice for them.]{.mark} This]{.underline}
emergent radicalism is already taking people by surprise. The Green New
Deal (GND), a term [presently most
associated](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/29/green-new-deal-plans-proposal-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-movement)
with 29-year-old US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has
provoked a wildly unhinged backlash from the "pro free market" wing, who
argue that it's a Trojan horse, nothing more than an attempt to
piggyback Marxism onto the back of climate legislation. The criticism
feels ridiculous. Partly because the GND is far from truly radical and
already represents a compromise solution, but mainly because the radical
economics isn't a hidden clause, but a headline feature. [Climate
change](https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange) is
the result of our current economic and industrial system. GND-style
proposals marry sweeping environmental policy changes with broader
socialist reforms because the level of disruption required to keep us at
a temperature anywhere below "absolutely catastrophic" is fundamentally,
on a deep structural level, incompatible with the status quo. Right now
we can, with a massive investment of effort by 2030, just about keep the
warming level below
[1.5C](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45678338). [This
is "[bad, but
manageable](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/2030-or-bust-5-key-takeaways-ipcc-report)"
territory. Failing to put that effort in sees the world crossing more
severe temperature barriers that would lead to outcomes like ecosystem
collapse, ocean acidification, mass desertification, and coastal cities
being flooded into inhabitability**[. We will simply have to throw the
kitchen sink at this. Policy tweaks such as a [carbon tax won't do
it](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/7/20/17584376/carbon-tax-congress-republicans-cost-economy).
We need to fundamentally re-evaluate our relationship to ownership, work
and capital. The impact of a dramatic reconfiguration of the industrial
economy require similarly large changes to the welfare state. Basic
incomes, large-scale public works programmes, everything has to be on
the table to ensure that the oncoming system shocks do not leave vast
swathes of the global population starving and destitute. Perhaps even
more fundamentally, we cannot continue to treat the welfare system as a
tool for disciplining the supposedly idle underclasses. Our system must
be reformed with a more humane view of worklessness, poverty and
migration than we have now.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Unfortunately for our
children, the people they have to convince of all this are the people
who have done very well out of this system, and are powerfully
incentivised to deny that it is all that bad. Already, Joke Schauvliege,
a Belgian environment minister, [has been forced to
resign](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/belgian-environment-minister-joke-schauvliege-claimed-children-climate-protests-a-set-up)
after falsely claiming that she had been told by Belgian state security
services that "ghosts" behind the scenes were behind demonstrations in
Belgium. This conspiracism of the elite, these claims that genuine mass
movement can't possibly really exist and must be in some way being
guided by agents provocateurs, is just one of the ways in which those
currently running things have resorted to a kind of political
gaslighting in an attempt to maintain their grip on power.
[Gaslighting](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/16/gaslighting-manipulation-reality-coping-mechanisms-trump)
is a term I don't use lightly, because it describes a genuine form of
emotional abuse, where an abuser will deny reality in an attempt to get
their victim to literally doubt their own sanity, and this should not be
diluted by overuse. Yet I struggle to think of another word that
adequately sums up the way in which "sensible" adults are doubling down
on their tactic of manufacturing a political reality which bears no
relationship to the world we see around us. It's the Marxism of Groucho
rather than Karl: "Who are you going to believe? The serious political
professionals or your own lying eyes?" US Senator Dianne Feinstein's
meeting with schoolchildren petitioning her to take action over [the
issue went
viral](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/22/dianne-feinstein-sunrise-movement-green-new-deal)
because of the way she condescended to them for, basically, asking her
to leave them a planet behind to live on. "I've been doing this for 30
years," she said, "I know what I'm doing." [The obvious response is, of
course, that messing something up for 30 years is quite long enough,
thanks. Long tenure without results is not the same thing as expertise.
This is a tough and bitter pill to swallow for the political
professionals whose feet are firmly under the table. It is increasingly
obvious that all their tactics have done almost nothing except run down
the clock, but still they insist that it's the young who just don't get
it and that things aren't that simple.]{.underline} They're the living
embodiment of the famous [New Yorker
cartoon](https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a16995), with a suited man
sat in a post-apocalyptic landscape telling his young audience "Yes, the
planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a
lot of value for shareholders." This is reality v the vested interests
of the powerful. Any meaningful policy has to upset the established
power base and the political donor class. Any policy that doesn't upset
these people will be useless. To pretend that we can compromise our way
through this while we wait for a magical, technological bullet that will
keep temperatures down without costing us anything is beyond wilful
ignorance now. It is a question of basic morality. Many of today's
climate strikers won't even be 30 by the time the 1.5C deadline comes
around in 2030. They are asking us to consider a simple question: is
their future worth more than preserving our reputations? What will our
response to them be?

#### The very notion of growth and consumption that Capitalism demands is antithetical to the very notion of Environmentalism -- These strucutres prevent any meaningful chance to stop Climate Change -- Eco socialism is key

**Polychroniou 18**, C. J., "Interview - Climate Change Is the Product
of How Capitalism "Values" Nature",
https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/19/11/2018/interview-climate-change-product-how-capitalism-values-nature

[[Climate change is the greatest existential crisis facing humanity
today. Capitalist industrialization has led us to the edge of the
precipice, and avoiding the end of civilization as we know it may
require the development of a view in direct opposition to the way in
which capitalism "values" nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to John
Bellamy Foster, professor of sociology at the University of Oregon and
editor of the socialist magazine Monthly Review. C. J. Polychroniou: We
live in a period of massive environmental disturbance, such that it has
led to the claim that we are no longer in the Holocene epoch but instead
in the midst of the Anthropocene era. Assuming that this claim,
popularized in the West by the atmospheric chemist and Nobel laureate
Paul Crutzen, is scientifically correct, to what extent can economic
growth itself be blamed for the catastrophic effects of human activities
on the environment, including influencing the climate by burning fossil
fuels, cutting down rainforests and farming livestock? John Bellamy
Foster: It is worth noting that the Anthropocene concept originated in
the early USSR. It first appeared in the English language in the
translation of The Great Soviet Encyclopedia in the 1970s. This arose
out of discussions of anthropogenic change and the biosphere pioneered
in Soviet science, pointing to today's Earth System perspective and to
our current, more developed notion of the Anthropocene. It now appears
to be the consensus in natural science that the Anthropocene epoch in
geological history commenced in the early 1950s, marked by a Great
Acceleration of anthropogenic impacts on the Earth System. The 2018
special report of the IPCC released last month emphasizes the shift from
the Holocene to the Anthropocene as signifying that anthropogenic
factors are now the leading sources of change in the Earth System, most
notably in the form of climate change. Economic activity at present, as
you note, relies heavily on burning fossil fuels, cutting down
rainforests, and livestock farming, all of which lead to the emission of
greenhouse gases that are accelerating climate change. [[Today's
planetary ecological crisis is due first and foremost to the increasing
scale of the capitalist world economy. The greater the scale of the
economy the more it rivals the fundamental biogeochemical cycles of the
planet. All of this is connected to the nature and logic of capitalism,
understood as a system directed at the accumulation of capital.
Capitalism is a grow-or-die system. If accumulation declines, the result
is economic crisis. The answer of the system is to boost accumulation.
This, however, intensifies global environmental crises as the already
visible impact of the economy on the Earth System
increases.]{.mark}]{.underline} To speak of economic growth as a
principal problem, and of the need for a steady-state economy as a
solution, immediately raises the specter in people's minds of the end of
human progress. However, we should be careful not to identify economic
growth, as that term is used today, with human advancement as a whole.
Economic growth was deified in the 1950s, following the introduction of
national income accounting during the Second World War. The system of
national or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) accounting is rooted in
capitalist notions of value added, profit and accumulation. It
accurately reflects the logic of capital accumulation but it is far
removed from growth in the wider sense in which people usually think of
it. This can be understood by looking at some of the details GDP
measurement. The work of subsistence workers in agriculture (or women
working in the household) is not included in GDP since their production
is outside the commodity market. If an oil tanker hits an iceberg
causing an oil spill, GDP increases, due to all the cleanup costs,
insurance payments, and lawyer fees. However, there is no deduction in
GDP for the effects of the oil spill on the environment. Social and
environmental costs, in this sense, are treated as "externalities," that
is to say, they are excluded from national-income accounting. The growth
of a forest adds nothing to economic growth. But the cutting down of the
same forest (viewed as so many millions of board feet of standing
timber) for sale on the market counts as growth. A war that kills
millions drives up economic growth, and leads to faster growth
afterwards because of the need to replace capital destroyed. The lives
lost in the war, however, count for nothing in economic growth terms.
[The problem here is not GDP accounting itself. Rather this way of
measuring growth accurately reflects how the capitalist system works. It
conceives progress only in terms of the cash nexus (whatever passes
through the market), as opposed to what benefits people or the planet.
In the advanced capitalist economies by far the greater part of
production consists of waste in terms of negative use values, that is,
products that are unproductive, superfluous, and destructive, while the
most basic human needs are often not met.]{.underline} This is
"rational" for today's monopoly-finance capital, but it is irrational
for society as a whole. All of this means we have to move away from
economic growth as it is understood in the current system and toward a
society of sustainable human development. Some mainstream
environmentalists believe that the problem is that nature is not fully
internalized within the system of market value, and that all of nature
should therefore be seen as "natural capital." However, we must remember
that value isn't everything: real wealth, life itself, cannot be reduced
to the logic of market valuation without undermining the very basis of
its existence. [You have been arguing for doing away with the concept of
"value" when it comes to nature. Does this mean that capitalism is
unavoidably bad for the environment? **[As far as its inner logic is
concerned, the answer is yes. For capitalism, accumulation of capital is
everything, the Earth and its inhabitants nothing. If value is created
by the exploitation of labor, this nonetheless requires constant
expropriation of a natural environment which is considered a free gift
to capital.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In its narrow pursuit of profits, the
capitalist system points inexorably to creative destruction on a
planetary scale. Karl Marx theorized this as the problem of the
metabolic rift, in which capitalism robbed the Earth itself as a basis
of the accumulation of capital. At the current carbon-emission rate, the
world will break the global carbon budget (i.e., will [reach the
trillionth metric ton in cumulative carbon
emissions](http://trillionthtonne.org/)) in seventeen years, threatening
out-of-control climate change. Other planetary boundaries are also being
crossed: resulting in the sixth extinction, ocean acidification, the
disruption of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, loss of forests,
global freshwater shortages, etc. These urgent problems have to be
addressed in the context of the present reality. This requires creation
of a massive, irrepressible, global movement toward socialism that goes
against the logic of the system: igniting a long ecological revolution.
I suppose then that you are not optimistic about technological solutions
curbing climate change and dealing with other environmental challenges
like air pollution, cleaning up the oceans and so on. **[[New technology
is indispensable in addressing global problems. But we have to have a
critical social theory of technology, and not see it as a deus ex
machina. Today's planetary emergency is partly the result of
technologies aimed almost exclusively at promoting profits. Destructive
technologies are employed, undermining living beings and the planet as a
safe home for humanity. We need a massive shift to solar and wind and
other alternatives, but the fossil-fuel economy and the goal of capital
accumulation stand in the way. Rational development and application of
technology in accordance with scientific and human criteria necessitates
a major transformation of our social relations.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The big mistake is to fall for a crude technologism, viewing technology
as a magic solution to all problems. This ideology is heavily promoted
by the system because it inculcates the idea that the current
acquisitive order can continue unchanged in its social relations. We are
told that some futuristic technology will enter in to save the day. The
fact is that a simple technological fix that would make it possible for
capitalist business as usual to continue indefinitely defies both the
laws of physics and the results of critical social science, which are
set aside in such technological fantasies... The consumerist strategy
--- that is, the idea that we can in effect do good things for the
environment and bring about overall social and economic change --- is
probably hopelessly romantic, at least for those of us who subscribe to
the materialist view of history. The question, then, is this: What is
needed to ensure that we can go on improving the standard of living
without causing harm to the environment? As a teacher, I have found that
one of the hardest things to convey to my students is that "consumer
sovereignty" is a myth. Most individuals in our society, absorbing the
received ideology, have come to believe that as consumers they dictate
what happens in the economy and the society. Hence, if they were to
choose as individuals and in the aggregate to change their consumption
habits and only buy Green products, the market would turn Green. All the
problems of the environment, they are convinced, are due to consumers
themselves. There are a lot of reasons to reject such views. First,
power in the capitalist economy rests on ownership and control of the
means of production, not with the consumer. Second, if all the household
waste in the United States going into municipal landfills were
eliminated this would only take care of about a small portion, [maybe as
little as 3
percent](https://discardstudies.com/2016/03/02/municipal-versus-industrial-waste-a-3-97-ratio-or-something-else-entirely),
of the total solid waste generated in the economy) , the rest occurs in
the realm of production under the aegis of corporations. Third, John
Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society pointed to what he called "the
dependence effect": What is consumed depends largely on what is
produced. Fourth, [over a trillion
dollars](http://www.metrics2.com/blog/2006/06/26/us_marketing_spending_exceeded_1_trillion_in_2005.html)
are spent per year in the US economy on marketing with the object of
getting people to buy things they neither need nor want. Fifth, the
sales effort has penetrated into the production process to such an
extent that there is little distinction nowadays between a product and
its brand image. Sixth, the enormous surveillance system in the private
sector organized around the Internet is mainly a means of manipulating
consumers. All of this suggests that gaining political control over
production is essential if the tendency toward environmental devastation
(together with the exploitation of labor) is to be surmounted. Given the
disastrous legacy of "actually existing socialism" with regards to the
environment, let alone political repression and other human rights
violations, how do you envision socialism in the 21st century?
Soviet-type societies were destructive of the environment on a level
comparable to the West, and turned into repressive class societies sui
generis (of their own type). Nonetheless, a vast environmental movement
developed in the USSR in the 1970s and '80s, led by scientists, along
with the emergence of the largest conservation organization in the
world. There were proposals by some Soviet economists, to revise the
USSR's planning system in terms of indicators of "gross social wealth,"
considering ecological factors. All of this went away with the
dissolution of the USSR. But it is important to understand that there
was a powerful ecosocialist critique developing among leading critical
Soviet intellectuals. What we see today as China's notion of "ecological
civilization" was first developed by ecosocialist thinkers in the Soviet
Union. Meanwhile, ecosocialism arose separately in the West in the 1980s
and '90s, and now has spread across the world. [[Ecosocialism thus
emerged as a radical movement both in capitalist and "actually existing
socialist" societies. Unlike mainstream Green theory, it recognizes that
to overcome the greatest historical challenge humanity has ever faced it
will be necessary to carry out a revolutionary reconstitution of society
at large. More and more people, especially in the global South, are
concluding, as a result of their own material experiences, that the
degradation of the environment and the exploitation of human beings have
a common basis in an alienated system that needs to be transcended. This
takes us back to the classical historical-materialist tradition
associated with Marx and Engels, which emerged at a time when struggles
over the workplace, the urban environment, and the land were seen as
inextricably connected. Understood in these terms, ecosocialism, is
based on the dual necessity of substantive equality and ecological
sustainability. System Change Not Climate Change!]{.mark}]{.underline}

[It's looking pretty apocalyptic out there. We're not just losing the
fight against climate change]{.underline} --- [we're losing it
badly](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/world/climate-change-un-emission-report-2018-wxc/index.html).
Carbon emissions aren't just not falling --- [they're
accelerating](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/12/05/we-are-trouble-global-carbon-emissions-reached-new-record-high/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.326cd87725e3):
2018's going to be the highest year ever. What's going wrong here? I
think that we need to change the story that we tell about climate
change, if we want to change our world. So far, it goes like this.
[[Climate change is "anthropogenic", man-made, an inevitable outcome of
a crowded, industrializing world]{.mark}.]{.underline} This story is
vague, imprecise. It says that we are all responsible. It assigns us all
some measure of guilt and shame, and therefore, some measure of
responsibility and grief, too. The problem is that this story is true
only in the most limited way --- and for that reason, it limits our
power to ever really fight climate change, too. If we look a little
deeper, I think we see a truer truth. [[Climate change isn't just
"man-made", as in caused by all of us, "humankind", a sad but
inescapable outcome of more people using more stuff. This story ---
which is a Malthusian one --- dooms us to impotence, through fatalism,
resignation, and sheer powerlessness. But climate change isn't some kind
of hopeless tragedy --- whose lines were written by sociobiological
destiny. **Climate change isn't just "anthropogenic." It's caused by
capitalism. If we're wise, we'd start calling it CCCC, capitalist caused
climate change, or corporate caused climate change if you
prefer.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Mom!! Umair's being mean to me again!!
Calm down, Tucker. Before you accuse me of being a college leftist, I
invite you to consider two stark empirical realities, which lead me to
that conclusion. When I put these two facts together, there is simply no
other conclusion that I think any reasonable person can really come to,
except that the story of climate change as merely "anthropogenic" is
inadequate, a half-truth, a polite evasion --- but I'll return to all
that. First, the two realities. [[The vast majority of carbon emissions
come not from just 100 companies --- a full 71% of
them](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change).]{.underline}
That's a stunning figure, isn't it? But what does it tell us? Well,
nearly all of them are oil and gas suppliers --- and most of them are
corporations. It's a truism to say something like "those companies
supply your energy!" Of course they do. The point is that as
corporations, they have no incentive to do so on what we might call
genuinely economical terms. Their sole purpose is to profit, and sweep
their "externalities", their hidden and unwanted costs, under the rug,
or shift them right back to you and me. Hence, you and I pay a far
larger chunk of our incomes in taxes than the corporations responsible
for 71% of carbon emissions do --- and we go on hoping that one day
maybe the hugely disproportionate tax dollars we pay will rein these
giants in. That, my friends, is a recipe for disaster --- [[because
while government can tax you and me, doing so won't really alter how
energy is supplied in the first place. Under capitalist terms, the
supply of energy will always be as dirty, brutal, and costly to society
and the planet as a corporation can possibly get away
with.]{.mark}]{.underline} Hence, stark evidence emerging that these
very same corporations have tried to brush the facts of climate change
under the rug, turning what should be a fact into a "controversy",
[funding propaganda and pseudoscience and so
forth](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tobacco-and-oil-industries-used-same-researchers-to-sway-public1/),
just like with tobacco. (That isn't to say something like "every oil and
gas supplier is bad!" Or "India and China are bad!" I want you to really
understand the point. The rules of global capitalism still simply don't
count environmental costs as "real", even while cities are beginning to
drown (LOL), and therefore, the way that energy is extracted and
supplied has little incentive to ever really change. The cheapest,
dirtiest forms, kinds, and methods will always be used until they simply
run out. Capitalism needs fundamental, systemic transformation at the
level that global GDP is counted, measured, and conceptualized.) Now,
the superconcentration of carbon emissions amongst capitalists might be
a damning enough indictment of capitalism --- but try this one. [The
only region of the world where greenhouse gas emissions have fallen is
Europe](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwj4kuzR4ovfAhWE-qQKHedhDLcQFjAAegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fenergy-environment%2F2018%2F12%2F05%2Fwe-are-trouble-global-carbon-emissions-reached-new-record-high%2F&usg=AOvVaw1lTQTcqbMJdXuqKkfOaJU7).
They've risen in China, America, and India. What does that mean? Let me
translate that fact into the hard terms of political economy. [[The only
system of political economy that we know of which appears capable of
reversing or mitigating climate change is social democracy. Wherever we
see capitalism --- whether it's Chinese state capitalism, or American
predatory capitalism, or Indian export-led capitalism --- nations fail,
and fail badly, to address climate change in any way
whatsoever.]{.underline}]{.mark} In stark contrast, European social
democracy has led to emissions falling --- which is exactly what the
world needs. Why is that? The reason isn't too hard to put your finger
on. Social democracy is better at fighting climate change because
there's (wait for it) less capitalism. Under social democracy, in much
of the economy, profit isn't maximized above all. Social investment can
happen --- whether in clean energy or in social systems, which support
it, like town squares and bike lanes. Regulations and rules are easier
to pass, and punishments are more severe. Cultural norms emerge which
sanction corporate misbehaviour. Different constituencies --- employees,
investors, managers, citizens --- can work together, instead of
adversarially, as in capitalism. As a result, social democracies are
able to take far more responsibility for their own true costs and
benefits --- instead of simply kicking the can down the road to the next
generation, country, decade, or century. It's not a surprise that Europe
leads the world in terms of green innovation --- it is the result of
social democracy doing what capitalism can't. Hence, Europe takes
agreements like Paris and Kyoto seriously --- it is able to because it's
political economy lets it do what capitalism alone cannot. [Let's put
the two facts together above now. Just 100 companies are responsible for
71% of greenhouse gas emissions, most of which are corporations --- all
of which are governed by a global capitalist system that still
"externalizes" environmental costs.]{.underline} Wherever societies are
governed by the logic of capitalism, even at this grim juncture,
emissions are accelerating in a kind of runaway fashion. The only region
in the world where those emissions have fallen is governed by social
democracy, which is able to treat climate change very differently than
capitalism, financially, economically, socially, and culturally. Are you
getting the picture I am yet? When I put all those dots together, here
is what I see. [Climate change isn't "anthropogenic", caused by
humankind in some kind of numinous, vague, general fashion, so much as
it is caused by a very specific kind of political economy ---
capitalism.]{.underline} Part of the challenge every great obstacle
presents us with is really understanding it. And to do that, we must
tell ourselves an accurate story about it. So far, the story we have
told about climate change isn't nearly that --- it is a half-truth, or
maybe just a fraction of the truth. It leaves probably the most
important part of the story out --- the cause, the reason, the motive,
the purpose, the driver. [We should stop calling it "anthropogenic"
climate change, and start calling it CCCC, capitalist caused climate
change (corporate caused climate change if you like.) That way, we begin
to tell a far more accurate, resonant, and powerful story of what really
went wrong in the world. It wasn't just that "more people" began to
"consume more resources." It was that the way that those resources were
consumed was foolish, wasteful, and wrong.]{.underline} Corporations
began to plunder and pillage the earth, sky, and oceans with abandon ---
institutions which didn't have to pay the costs of restoring any of the
damage they were doing, because, thanks to the rules of global
capitalism, that damage was a benefit, not a cost. And so they ripped
across the planet like locusts. But it didn't have to be that way ---
and it still doesn't have to be that way. It was that way because the
rules of capitalism made it that way. When we understand that part of
the story, we have made a crucial link: we have connected environmental
catastrophe with political economy. And that is still something we are
reluctant to do at this stage, too often, even as severe climate
changes, fire, flood, and famine, descend upon us. Don't you think it's
strange we are still afraid, still hesitant, to connect the dots of
political economy and environmental catastrophe --- even while cities
and states begin to sink, crumble, and burn? I do. How long will it take
us to do so? Are we employing the logic Americans use for fascism ---
"you can't say that person's a fascist until the Holocaust arrives!" If
that's our logic --- then haven't we failed the test of reason? [Instead
of a system that weighed the true social and environmental costs and
benefits of consuming a resource --- which is what social democracy
begins to allow Europeans to do --- the world stayed stuck in the
capitalist paradigm that America had exported. But under the terms of
this paradigm, the entire world could quite literally burn down, and GDP
would "grow" --- as long as you and I had to put out the
fire.]{.underline} [[The capitalist paradigm, which is an American
creation, is only concerned, perhaps obsessed, with maximizing profit
--- but that also means that it is dead set against ever assessing,
counting, or weighing it's real costs, much less ever paying them, much
less ever investing in reversing them.]{.underline}]{.mark} Hence, the
engine of world trade today, China lending to America so that Americans
can buy cheap Chinese made goods on credit, would collapse in an
instant, if environmental costs were added to the bill. But those costs
don't just disappear --- they are simply shifted forward to the future
with interest, like a debt. And the problem is that when that debt isn't
made of money any longer, but made of floods, fires, and famines --- how
is it to be repaid? [We need to change our story of climate change ---
and we need to change it now --- so that we can change our world.
Capitalism isn't just "bad at" fighting climate change. It is what is
causing climate change in the first place --- it is incapable of
"fighting" the very thing it causes.]{.mark} The moment that we
understand that climate change is caused by capitalism, not just
"humankind", then we gain newfound power to really fight it. Then we
understand that really rescuing the planet from flood, fire, and famine
is going to require a paradigm change in political economy, too. It is
going to require something like the dawn of global social democracy. If
that sounds impossible to you, then you have decided, in a way, that the
future will be catastrophe. If it sounds possible to you, then perhaps
you understand the scale of the challenge now in a different way. The
choice, as always, is yours.

### Heg

#### Capitalism and Global Hegemony are Intertwined

"[Global [hegemony]{.mark}" might [be defined as a situation in which
one nation]{.mark}-state [plays a]{.mark} predominant [role in
organizing, regulating, and stabilizing the world]{.mark} political
[eco]{.mark}nomy. [The]{.mark}]{.underline} use of armed force has
always been an inseparable part of hegemony, but military power depends
upon the [[economic]{.underline}]{.mark} resources at the disposal of
the state. It cannot be deployed to answer every threat to geopolitical
and economic interests, and it raises the danger of imperial overreach,
as was the case for Britain in South Africa (1899--1902) and the United
States in Vietnam (1962--1975). Britannia ruled the waves from 1815 to
1913, but by the 1890s she was under economic challenge from the United
States and Germany, and between the two world wars was no longer able to
function as underwriter to the world system. U.S. hegemony began during
the Second World War and peaked some thirty years later. The United
States still has immense---unequalled---[[power]{.underline}]{.mark} in
international economics and politics, but even as the sole superpower it
finds itself less able than it once was to influence and control the
course [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} events abroad. Its military supremacy
is no longer matched in [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} economic and
political spheres, and is of dubious value in preserving the global
economic order and the stake that [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} capital
has in it. Even during the golden days of 1944--1971 the United States
was unable to avoid military defeat in Vietnam and a draw in Korea. Slow
Merge Ahead: Hegemony Since the 1970s An idea of [the [decline]{.mark}
of American economic power can be forme[d]{.mark} from the following:1
[In 1950 the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [supplied half the
world's gross product, against 21 percent at present. Sixty percent of
the]{.mark} world's [manufacturing production]{.mark} in 1950 [came from
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [25 percent in
1999]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. share of exports of commercial
services, the fastest growing part of the world economy, stood at 24
percent in 2001, while the European Union (EU) had 23 percent---40
percent if intra-EU exports were counted. [[Non-U.S. companies
dominated]{.mark} major industries in 2002, accounting for [nine of the
ten]{.mark} largest [electronics and electrical equipment
manufacturers;]{.mark} [eight of the ten largest motor vehicle makers
and]{.mark} electric and gas utilities; [seven of the ten]{.mark}
largest [petroleum refiners]{.mark}; [six of ten telecommunications
companies; five of ten pharmaceutical firms; four of six chemical
producers; four of seven airlines.]{.mark} [Of]{.mark} the
[twenty-five]{.mark} [largest banks in the world, nineteen were non-U.S.
banks,]{.mark} although the two largest were Citigroup and Bank of
America. [Of the top one hundred corporations in the world]{.mark} in
2000 ranked by foreign-held assets, [twenty-three were
American]{.mark}.]{.underline} Together, Germany, France, the United
Kingdom, and the Netherlands, with a combined gross domestic product
(GDP) seven-tenths that of the United States, had forty; Japan had
sixteen. During the 1990s, the share of U.S. multinationals in the
foreign sales of the world's one hundred largest multinationals
decreased from 30 to 25 percent; the share of EU-based companies
increased from 41 to 46 percent. [[Twenty-one percent of the world's
stock]{.mark} of direct investment in other countries [was
American]{.mark} in 2001, [compared with 47 percent in 1960.]{.mark}
During 1996--2001, 17 percent of all new direct investment abroad came
from the United States and 16 percent from Great Britain; together,
France and Belgium-Luxembourg supplied 21 percent. Of the twenty-five
largest mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the United States in
1998--2000, five involved takeovers by foreign multinationals (three
British, two German). Of the top twenty corporations involved in
cross-border M&As from 1987 through 2001, only two were U.S. (General
Electric and Citigroup); they accounted for 5 percent of the value of
all M&A deals during these years.]{.underline} In global finance, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} not only [less dominant, but
vulnerable. The]{.mark} weak link is the [dollar, whose status as the
world's]{.mark} key [currency has been eroding]{.mark} since the 1970s,
irregularly and with periodic revivals.]{.underline} Between 1981 and
1995, the share of private world savings held in European currencies
increased from 13 percent to 37 percent, while the dollar's share fell
from 67 to 40 percent. Forty-four percent of new bonds have been issued
in euros since the new currency was introduced in 1999, closing in on
the 48 percent issued in dollars. Half the foreign exchange reserves
held by the world's central banks were composed of dollars in 1990
compared to 76 percent in 1976; the proportion rose back to 68 percent
in 2001 because of the phasing out of ecus (reserves issued to European
banks by the European Monetary Institute) to make way for the euro.2
[For the first time since the Second World War there is another source
of universally acceptable payment and liquidity in the world
economy---at a moment when the U.S. balance of international payments is
chalking up record deficits. Since 1971, when [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [had a deficit in]{.mark} its [trade]{.mark} in goods
(merchandise) [for the first time in seventy-eight years]{.mark},
exports have exceeded imports only in 1973 and 1975.]{.underline} A
nation can run deficits in its trade in goods and still be in overall
balance in its dealings with foreign countries. Deficits in trade in
goods can be offset by having a positive balance in sales of services
abroad (financial, insurance, telecommunications, advertising and other
business services) and/or income from overseas investments (profits,
dividends, interest, royalties, and the like). But the U.S. merchandise
deficit has become too big to be paid for by services sold to foreigners
plus remittances on investments. [The U.S. current account (the sum of
the balances in trade in goods and services plus net income from
overseas investment), almost constantly in surplus from 1895 to 1977, is
now deteriorating sharply; the merchandise deficit has become too big to
be paid for by services sold to foreigners. And since 1990, the positive
balance [on investment income has been shriveling]{.mark} as foreign
investment in the United States has grown faster than U.S. investment
abroad. In 2002, the balance turned negative: for the first time the
United States is paying foreigners more investment income from their
holdings here than it receives from its own investments abroad. Like
most gaps between income and expenses, the current account deficit is
covered by borrowing. In 2002, the United States borrowed \$503 billion
from abroad, a record 4.8 percent of GDP. When foreigners receive
dollars from transactions with U.S. residents (individuals, companies,
governments), they can use them to buy American assets (U.S. Treasury
bonds, corporate bonds and stocks, companies, and real
estate).]{.underline} This is how the United States turned into a debtor
nation in 1986; foreign-owned assets in the United States are now worth
\$2.5 trillion more than U.S.-owned assets abroad. By mid-2003,
[[foreigners owned 41 percent of U.S. Treasury]{.mark} marketable
[debt,]{.mark} 24 percent of all U.S. corporate bonds, and 13 percent of
corporate stock. U.S. companies are continuing to invest abroad, but
unlike the British Empire in the decades before the First World War, the
United States is unable to finance those investments from its current
account. By contrast, Great Britain's current account was in surplus,
averaging 3 to 4 percent of GDP every year from 1850 to 1913, when
income from services and foreign investment was larger than its
merchandise trade deficits.]{.underline}3 So far the global investor
class has seemed willing to finance America's external deficits, but it
may not be forever. The [deficits are exerting a downward drag on the
dollar, arousing suspicion that the United States favors a cheaper
dollar to help pay off its ballooning trade deficit. As the dollar
declines in value, the return to foreign investors on dollar-denominated
assets falls. German investments in choice office properties in New
York, San Francisco, and elsewhere were cut back sharply in
2003.]{.underline} While the buildings were becoming cheaper in euros,
rents were shrinking when converted from dollars back home. "We can get
the same return in Britain and the Nordic countries, so why go to the
United States, where the currency risk is greater?" asked the chief
investment officer of a Munich-based property fund.4 Until recently all
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sold their oil for
dollars only; Iraq switched to the euro in 2000 (presumably terminated
with extreme prejudice in March 2003), and Iran has considered a
conversion since 1999. In a speech in Spain in April 2002, the head of
OPEC's Market Analysis Department, Javad Yarjani, saw little chance of
change "in the near future...\[but\] in the long run the euro is not at
such a disadvantage versus the dollar. [[The Euro-zone has a bigger
share of global trade than the US]{.mark} and...a more balanced external
accounts position."]{.underline} Adoption of the euro by Europe's
principal oil producers, Norway and Britain, could create "a momentum to
shift the oil pricing system to euros." Thus, concluded Yarjani, "OPEC
will not discount entirely the possibility of adopting euro pricing and
payments in the future."5 If foreign investors get cold feet, ceasing to
invest in U.S. industries or selling off their dollar holdings, the
dollar would start falling faster. Interest rates in the United States
might surge, borrowing money would become harder, and consumers would
pay more for imported goods, draining income from other purchases and
dampening the economy. A dollar rout could cause skittish investors to
dump U.S. stocks and bonds, sending Wall Street into a dive. In any
event the dollar is now perceived to be as risky an asset as the euro
and possibly two or three other currencies (yen, sterling, Swiss franc).

### Human rights

#### Human rights produces a distinct subjectivity known as homo juridicus - that reinforces market ideology in society

**Odysseos 10** Louiza, "Human Rights, Liberal Ontogenesis and Freedom:
Producing a Subject for Neoliberalism,
tps://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/12710695/Millennium_2010_published.pdf,
2010

This article offers a contribution to critical examinations of human
rights within contemporary liberalism. [[Human rights today attempt to
concretise liberalism's commitment to individual freedom and to act as a
counterweight against charges that it is the ideology of the market and
of the economic status quo, marginalising the poor and
disadvantaged]{.mark}.]{.underline}1 The article is chiefly interested
in examining [[human rights' largely under-explored role in
subjectification, which is important for understanding liberalism's
complex (global) politics. Specifically, the article uses Michel
Foucault's recently translated discussions of liberalism and
neoliberalism2 to interrogate the ways in which human rights produce a
distinct subjectivity, which it calls homo
juridicus:]{.underline}]{.mark} this is a subject amenable to
self-government and, as such, acts as a partner, indeed a predicate, to
neoliberal governmentality. To do so, the article eschews the
commonplace understandings of liberalism as a theory of individual
freedom or as an ideology of the socio-economic status quo. Rather, it
reads liberalism as a historically distinct 'technology of government'
characterised by its signature impulse, what Foucault called 'the
internal rule of maximum economy'.3 [[The liberal technology of
government best embodies the rule of maximum economy -- which refers to
the attempt to achieve maximum ends with minimal, cost-effective action
-- by evolving away from extensive and direct state involvement towards
the more minimalist directing of the 'possible fields of action of
others'.4 A contracting state is accompanied, however, by an expansion
of 'government'.]{.mark}]{.underline} '[Government' here refers to the
regulative but often indirect activities by state, para- or sub-state
agents, and civil society actors and institutions: government becomes
'the conduct of conduct'.5 However, this is no straightforward retreat
of the state;]{.underline}6 rather, it marks the state's
'governmentalisation', which refers to its involvement in the pastoral
care and welfare of the population, that is, in 'biopolitical' and
'governmental' ends. Given the costly and intensive nature of such an
expansion in the biopolitical goals of government, it has to
increasingly promote and encourage 'self-government' and, in particular,
the calling into being of types of subjects able to take up freedom in
radically new ways and govern themselves.7 Understanding liberalism as a
technology of government, therefore, demands closer examination of its
'relations of subjectivation' to 'manufacture' the free, self-governing
subject.8 Taking inspiration from Foucault's specific discussion of homo
oeconomicus, 9 a type of self-interested and rational self-governing
subject which makes possible the limitation of neoliberal governmental
practice, the article illustrates how human rights' production of homo
juridicus also predicates liberalism and neoliberal governmentality and
the evolving global liberal order.10 In doing so, the discussion acts as
an immanent critique of Foucault's relative neglect of human rights11
and his cursory dismissal of the juridical subject's subjectification as
enabling of neoliberalism.12 The article identifies human rights'
relations of subjectification as 'liberal ontogenesis', the latter being
a term retrieved from its origins in developmental biology where it
usually denotes the development of organisms from embryonic origin to
maturation. 13 [[Critically applying the term 'ontogenesis' to the
engendering of a mature moral and legal subject of human rights, the
article illustrates this complex process in its distinct but related
forms. These are rhetorical, epistemic, performative and structural
ontogeneses. Exploring each form of liberal ontogenesis confirms that
liberalism does have an intimate relationship with freedom but not
because it is predicated upon the pre-given, free and sovereign
individual, which is the core ontological premise or ground of liberal
thought.14 Rather, liberal governmental practice requires -- and indeed
must produce, and produce globally, through its discourses, knowledge
production, law-making and restructuring of the 'conditions of
freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}'15 -- the free and sovereign (here
understood as self-governing) subject, whose behaviour can then be
directed according to the 'right' (here understood as minimal)
'disposition of things'.16 In other words, the liberal ontogenesis by
human rights now becomes an integral part of governmental practice,
while recasting irrevocably the very meaning of freedom itself. The
first section below selectively explores a number of important elements
in Foucault's discussions of liberalism, pastoral power and homo
oeconomicus as the partner subjectivity of neoliberal governmentality.
[This prefaces and provides key concepts for the subsequent examination
of human rights and their production of homo juridicus in the main
section of the article. The final section explores the implications of
liberal ontogenesis for our understanding of freedom and the dilemma
this poses for critical thought.]{.underline}

### Nuclear War

#### Fears of nuclear war are a tactic ginned up as the puerile and declining imperial bourgeoisie at last face defeat from worker's states. You should refuse their blackmail.

**Posadas 72** \[J. Posadas, also known as Homero Rómulo Cristalli
Frasnelli, big brained Argentinian Marxist, *WAR IS NOT THE END OF THE
WORLD: IT IS AN ATOMIC 'CHARCO'*, 9/20/72, //Stefan\]

The question of the atomic war is one of the overriding themes that
dominate the preoccupation of the human beings, of the proletariat. This
preoccupation, however, is not the same as fear. The concern is: How are
we to face this? What will happen before, during and after? How will
humanity behave? [In the matter of the atomic war, as in any other
situation of calamity and class struggle, one must cling with great
firmness to the class analyses, class conclusions and class experiences
that put their entire trust in the proletariat and in humanity. Although
the atomic war petrifies the bourgeoisie, the latter will launch it all
the same. The bourgeoisie senses that the atomic war is 'curtains' for
it -- and this cripples it with fear. In the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and other countries, it makes shelters for itself
hundreds of meters belowground]{.underline}, with cinemas, generators,
bathrooms and domestic servants' quarters. [Bourgeois people may take
refuge in there, but capitalist power will end, even if imperialism wins
the war. Imperialism winning the war would bring new conditions in
history. Triumph and power would fall to military types who will oust
the political leaders of private property. The retrogression will fling
society back to the middle Ages, under a system of production inferior
even to the middle Ages. The conditions will not exist to create a new
form of property, and those in charge will have to fight in order not to
be dispossessed. To live on, they will have to increase the use of
science and technology, and today's problems will return. There is no
perspective for those people, even if they win the war. We reiterate
that we do not want the atomic war.]{.underline} The Bolshevik programme
was against war. To those who asked the Bolsheviks why they were
fighting, the Bolsheviks answered that their fight was "war against
war", to stop the oppression and the massacres of the class enemy. Did
they have another option? Is there another option? Should someone
discover another option, we will support it! But there is none. [The
atomic war is inevitable because imperialism is going to use all its
weapons. Hence we prepare for it, counting on all the possible forces,
like the Workers States and Revolutionary States that exist today. As a
class, the proletariat feels secure in history. It does not fear the
atomic war.]{.underline} Its industrial and political preparation
disposes it to revolutionary action, but it derives this disposition
mainly from its role in society -- regardless of Trade Union and
political preparation. Through its function in the economy and in
society, the proletariat sees that capitalism is unnecessary. The
proletariat lives the daily reality of capitalism's social role making
no contribution to the human relations. Within itself, the proletariat
feels that it is producing, reproducing and contributing usefully,
whether the capitalists stand over it or not. The proletariat sees its
labour as part of human ingeniousness. It feels part of the intelligence
that elaborates science and technology. Although the proletariat
realises that society depends upon it, it does not adopt the attitudes
of superiority or arrogance to be found in the other social classes. In
the other social classes, conservative and egoistical sentiments
motivate their attitudes and social inclinations. The proletariat as a
class cannot have such attitudes, motives or social inclinations,
because it does not generate such sentiments. The role that the
proletariat plays in the economy guards it against conservatism and
egoism. It knows that its effective labour is part of an endeavour that
includes the technicians and scientists. It sees also that the
capitalists operate right outside that endeavour, utilizing technology
for themselves, just as they utilize science and human labour. The
proletariat knows that society and production depend upon it, in a way
that would not change if there were no capitalists. This is why those in
power experience any Trade Union proposal as a power duality, a bid for
power, a casting out of the capitalist. Due to its function in society
and the economy, the proletariat feels confident and secure. Production
having become increasingly socialised, this inner confidence has grown
over time into an unfettered communist consciousness. In Roman times,
the proletariat played a role too, but not as a class. It is capitalist
development and big industry that developed the proletariat as a class.
Big capitalist industry and collective production have given rise to
collective consciousness. Collective consciousness arises from the
socialised process of capitalist production, where a collective form of
participation became necessary. The proletariat feels fundamentally part
of this. In its historic class development, proletarian consciousness
evolved through Workers Parties that eventually led to the Bolshevik
Party. At the time of the First International -- and later with the
Socialist parties -- partial and limited aspects of this consciousness
emerged. With the triumph of the Russian Revolution, the proletariat
came to full consciousness through Communist Parties aware now that
progress demanded the transformation of society. The structure of
society as it stands, along with its relations of production and
exchange, makes any new form of private property impossible. The
centralisation of property has given rise to a great technical capacity
where each new level of concentration generates more productivity.
Matters have now reached the point where this great concentration and
centralisation simply need planning. With planning, productivity will be
a hundred times what it is now. The obstacle in the way is private
property and competition -- that is to say, the market. The proletariat
developed through those forms; and when Marxism arrived, it gave a
consciousness that only the proletariat can have. The proletariat
derives its ability from its function in society, as we said, but it
derives it also from the Party8. The collective consciousness of the
proletariat mounts from the established form of production up towards
the Party. The Party then takes on the task of upholding it consciously
and teaching it. The Party defends the historic notion and spreads the
comprehension that the new society must start from the levels and
structures attained in capitalism, i.e., from big and centralised
production[. Human progress must start from the level of concentration
and centralisation reached in capitalism. All it needs is a new form.
What new form? The Workers State! And from the Workers State to
Socialism!]{.underline} [The proletariat is conscious; it feels secure.
It does not fear catastrophes, economic mayhem or the destruction of the
riches that humanity has produced. It feels like those who have nothing
to lose. Its position in the economy clears its consciousness of
egoistical conclusions. The capitalists cannot live outside accumulation
and profit-making]{.underline} Capitalist society has concentrated the
means of production. This has brought about big industrial development,
high technology and high productivity. Capitalism knows how to produce
more, in less time and at the same costs. If this talent were applied to
a collective society, production would triple at once. It is only that,
in capitalism, property is concentrated through competition and through
the capitalists' implacable need to profit and accumulate. No capitalist
can change this without going bankrupt. Any attempt at changing this
breaks the M-C-M cycle (money-commodity-money). It is to keep this cycle
going that the capitalists must preserve the existing social and
economic order. Capital has reached the point where it can no longer
boost its own capacity to expand. It reacts by turning in upon itself,
increasing it financial centralisation. This lessens the number of
capitalists because competition liquidates them. Meanwhile, the Workers
States continue to advance. They are plagued by a lack of means, of
traditions and of preparation, but they can still resolve in 20 years
what capitalism never did in 200. The proletariat takes stock. It will
start from that level of attainment when it finally breaks the
bureaucratic yoke. The proletariat is confident and secure in the notion
that anything and everything can be rebuilt. Where the proletariat
stands, society stands too, for society depends upon it. The proletariat
occupies a place at the heart of production where there are no
sentiments of egoism, appropriation, competition, vanity or selfishness.
These sentiments are those of private property. When private property
has gone, those sentiments will go too. The proletariat enters the war
with these characteristics. The proletariat has the historic and actual
experience of 14 Workers States and 16 Revolutionary States. The
Revolutionary States are influenced by the proletariat through the
concept of the Workers State -- i.e. State-owned property and the
collectivised economy. That is to say, the world at large views the
proletariat in light of the Workers States. The irrepressible confidence
of the proletariat stems from its feeling socially irreplaceable. The
proletariat is unafraid; it has nothing to lose "but its chains", as
Marx says. Through its function as a class, the proletariat already
feels itself to be organising history. It has no world Party, but it
knows itself to be the decisive factor of social organisation. You get a
measure of this when you look at its behaviour. Its conduct in the
Workers States is of a very fine order when you consider how it resists
bureaucracy and takes great care not to harm the Workers State. This has
been the conduct of the proletariat at every turn: in Germany in 1953,
Hungary in 1958 and in Stettin & Dantzig (Poland) this year9. [The
proletariat enters the war with this ability and knowledge. It has
nothing to lose and everything to gain]{.underline}. From where it has
stood in history and in the economy, [it has grown the sort of
confidence, resilience and determination that makes the rest of the
population wish to follow it. The atomic war is going to produce
disarray, horror and shock. There will be a loss of reasoning in many
people, but the proletariat will be the least affected. Those most
affected will be the bourgeois whom you already see futureless and
perspective-less, seeing nothing but death ahead. The bourgeois hope to
secure their future by burying themselves 100 meters below the ground --
where they will stay. A preview of how the proletariat is going to enter
the nuclear war shows already in the conduct of the masses of Vietnam,
of the Middle East, and of anywhere indeed. The proletariat gives
constant demonstrations that it does not let itself be bullied, wiped
out or debilitated. It is going to enter the atomic war with the all
vigour it displays in the class struggle. The Yankees have threatened to
use atomic weapons against Vietnam, but the proletariat did not quake.
It went on supporting Vietnam and encouraged it to fight on. The mayhem
and monstrous capitalist crimes that will mark the start of the nuclear
war will be immediately followed by the proletariat moving into action.
The proletariat will embark upon social reorganisation. It will draw
together what is left of the world populations and make a ruling class
with it. In that process, its intervention will focus on the liquidation
of every remnant, if any, of capitalism and bureaucracy]{.underline}. \*
\* \* \* The First World War produced the Soviet Workers State. In spite
of Stalin's best efforts to stop the extension of the Russian
Revolution, [the Second World War brought 8 more Workers
States.]{.underline} There are now 14 Workers States and 16
Revolutionary States. [The Third World War is the end of the capitalist
system. Mind that we do not seek the nuclear war. We do not reckon that
such a war was the right way to get rid of the capitalist system, but
this is how history has panned out.]{.underline} We just speak as we
find. As far as we are concerned, we prepare to face this situation by
treasuring every useful means that history creates along the way,
determined to do everything and draw all the conclusions necessary for
the construction of Socialism. It is not that we are without feelings!
From the most profound of our Communist emotions, [we lament the tragedy
which is coming to millions and millions of human beings. We are not
those who are guilty or responsible for it. Capitalism is!]{.underline}
Feeling this too, [the proletariat is all the more determined not to
feel intimidated.]{.underline} The notion that the atomic war is going
to crush so many millions of people fills us with appalling distress,
but we do not feel responsible or guilty. [Where we feel we have a
responsibility, yes, is in proposing ways and means to help overcome the
atomic 'charco' as fast as possible, and get Socialism under way. At the
start of, and during the atomic war, humanity will be penetrated by the
collective sentiment of the proletariat -- the very sentiment that helps
the proletariat not to fear the atomic war and the consequences of
capitalist barbarism.]{.underline} Observe how elevated the behaviour of
humanity already is, in spite of finding itself without a class-and-mass
revolutionary Party. It has mass parties, but they are not
revolutionary. Humanity is going to behave in the way made necessary by
its need to face up. If someone could prove to us that postponing the
Socialist Revolution by 20, 30 or 50 years could avoid the nuclear war,
we would go along with the idea. The matter however stems from a
historic necessity, not a number of years. [The atomic war is
inevitable. And it will be followed, immediately, during and afterwards,
by the world triumph of the Socialist Revolution.]{.underline}

[Capitalism's basic problems are intrinsic.]{.underline} They comprise
the employer-employee relationship at its core and that relationship's
results for the broader economy, politics and culture. Modern society's
systemic problem is capitalism, not this or that kind of capitalism.
[[Reforms have replaced one kind of cap]{.mark}italism [with
another]{.mark}. Beside the problems that reforms could not solve, the
[reforms]{.mark} themselves [proved temporary and insecure]{.mark}.
Usually won by employees' long battles, the [reforms get lost because
capitalists have the incentives]{.mark} (profits) and resources
(profits) [to]{.mark} evade, weaken or [repeal them]{.mark}. For
example, progressive give way to regressive taxes, once-separated

#### Reforms to Capitalism Fail- History Proves

But the question none of them ever addresses, let alone answers in any
meaningful sense, is why did this so-called social compact---itself more
a fantasy than a reality because post-war America was riven with class
and social conflicts---collapse? It is as if suddenly one morning,
around the end of the 1970s, political leaders in the US and around the
world woke up on the wrong side of the bed and decided that the ideology
of the unfettered free market had to be adopted, destroying
[[the]{.mark} very [social order]{.mark} that they had so carefully
constructed in order [to maintain capitalist rule]{.mark} after the
turbulent, and at times revolutionary, struggles of the previous
period.]{.underline} There is no trace of science, economic or
otherwise, in such a method. It seeks the source of changes in the
capitalist economy in the mindset of bourgeois politicians, such as
Reagan or Thatcher in the 1980s, or in the shifts in the theories of
bourgeois economics from Keynesian state regulation to the free market
doctrines of Milton Friedman. A scientific explanation for the ending of
the post-war boom must be sought in the internal, material, objective
processes of the capitalist economy, which were the source of the
adoption of neo-liberalism based on the unfettered domination of the
market and finance capital. In an effort to boost his assertion of the
possibility of "progressive capitalism," Stiglitz harks back to the
period following World War II when it appeared that the "American
Dream," after the devastation of the 1930s, was finally being realised.
"As an economist," he writes, "I am always being asked: [Can we afford
to provide [this middle class life]{.mark} [for most,]{.mark} let alone
[all, Americans]{.mark}? Somehow, we did [when we were a]{.mark} much
[poorer society]{.mark} after World War II." The implication is that
since [America today is]{.mark} a [much richer]{.mark} country in terms
of the production of material wealth th[an]{.mark} the post war
perio[d]{.mark}, then it must be possible, under capitalism, to [provide
the rising living standards]{.mark} that characterised the three decades
following the war. Such assertions [are]{.mark} based on a fundamental
[flaw]{.mark}.]{.underline} The driving force of the capitalist economy,
its inherent dynamic, is not the provision of more material wealth.
Capitalism is driven by the accumulation of profit, the source of which
is the surplus value [extract[ed]{.mark}]{.underline} from the working
class in the process of production. And here the key question is the
rate at which this accumulation takes place, measured by the rate of
profit. [The historical development of the post-war boom, its demise and
the evolution of the capitalist economy in the period since then must be
examined from this standpoint. America was a "poorer" country in the
post-war period in the sense that it produced less material wealth both
on an absolute and per capita basis than today. But in that period
American capitalism enjoyed stable and even rising profit
rates]{.underline}. This upswing, following the disasters of the 1930s,
was the result of global processes. It was the outcome of the extension
of the more productive methods of American industrial capitalism to the
other major economies---Germany and Western Europe, the UK, Japan and
lesser capitalist powers such as Australia and New Zealand---which
significantly increased the mass of surplus value extracted from the
working class[. From the standpoint of the capital accumulation process,
[all reforms]{.mark} and concessions to the working class---rising wages
and improved social conditions---[represent a deduction from]{.mark} the
mass of [surplus value]{.mark} available to capital for its
expansion.]{.underline} But such was the expansion of the available
surplus value in the post-war boom that both rising profit rates and
rising living standards were possible. As the saying had it: a rising
tide lifted all boats. To the short-sighted bourgeois academy, it
appeared that the fundamental contradictions of capitalism, laid bare by
Marx, contradictions that had produced two world wars, fascism and the
Great Depression in the space of just three decades, had been overcome.
But the expansion of the post-war boom could not continue indefinitely.
By the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, profit rates
began to turn down. [The law of the tendency of the rate of profit to
fall, characterised by Marx as the most important law of political
economy from the historical point of view, had begun to reassert itself.
In essence, this meant that the concessions made to the working class
now came into direct conflict with the requirements of capital
accumulation, that is, with the motive force of the profit system. All
attempts to resolve this situation within the framework of the post-war
social and economic order failed. Efforts to step up the exploitation of
the working class within the existing system of industrial production
only produced ever more militant struggles.]{.underline} At the same
time, the methods of Keynesian economics, based on the stimulation of
the economy through government intervention, only resulted in
stagflation. That is, a rise in unemployment coupled with accelerating
inflation, which the Keynesian doctrine had ruled out. Faced with this
intractable situation, the ruling classes in the US and the other major
economies, now espousing the doctrines of neo-liberalism, organised a
fundamental restructuring of the capitalist economy. It comprised a
series of interconnected components including: the destruction of vast
areas of post-war industry; [the organisation of global production to
utilise cheaper sources of labour; and the employment of new
computer-based technologies and information systems to slash production
costs and intensify the exploitation of labour. These measures were
accompanied by the unleashing of finance capital from the constraints
that had been imposed on it during the post-war boom. This enabled it to
play a central role in the complete reorganisation of industry through
takeovers, mergers and acquisitions, often via the so-called junk bond
market, as well as creating the conditions for the accumulation of
profit via the stock market and other forms of speculation.]{.underline}
The upshot was to institutionalise a system in which the wealth created
by the labour of the working class was siphoned up to the heights of
society, leading to the stagnation and outright decline in real wages
and the creation of the greatest level of social inequality seen at any
point in history, in the US and around the world. Sweeping changes were
required in the legal framework to facilitate this domination of finance
capital. In his article, Stiglitz points to the key role played by the
Reagan administration in beginning this process. But he stops there. The
measures adopted under Reagan were only the start. They were continued
and deepened under the Clinton administration, of which Stiglitz himself
was a part as chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers
in 1995-97. [It was the Clinton administration, with Robert Rubin taking
the helm as treasury secretary after 26 years at Goldman Sachs, which
ended "welfare as we know it" and repealed the Glass-Steagall Act in
1999, removing the last remnants of the restrictions imposed on finance
capital in the 1930s]{.underline}. [While the measures enacted over the
past three decades have enabled an increase in profit rates, there has
been no return to the conditions of the post-war boom. [The US
econ]{.mark}omy [is no longer characterized]{.mark}, as it was in that
period, [by]{.mark} the growth of investment and the [expansion of
decent-paying jobs, but]{.mark} by [the rise]{.mark} and rise [of
parasitism and speculation. This has been accompanied by new forms of
exploitation]{.mark}, ever-present job insecurity, two-tier wage systems
and the growth of casual and just-in-time employment conditions, coupled
with the worsening conditions for public employees, above all
teachers.]{.underline} The US economy is no longer driven by the
investment in new production facilities but has become increasingly
dependent on the injection of trillions of dollars into the financial
system to fund speculation, starting with the decision of the then
chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, to open the spigots
for the banks and finance house following the October 1987 stock market
crash. All of these tendencies and processes have reached new levels in
the decade since the financial crash of 2008 such that the US economy
and financial system cannot tolerate any return to what were once
considered "normal" monetary policies lest this produce a new and even
more devastating crisis. The central plank of the program advanced by
Stiglitz and others is an increase in taxes to bring about a new social
compact. But the bankruptcy of this perspective is immediately exposed
when one considers what would be the outcome of such measures. Long
before being enacted, they would be met with a counter-revolution from
above directed against the working class. The lineaments are already in
view with the drive by the Trump administration to develop authoritarian
forms of rule, supported by the Democrats as they seek to deflect
opposition to the Trump regime behind the bogus allegations of Russian
interference. [The paths opening up before [the]{.mark} American
[working class,]{.mark} and by extension the work[i]{.mark}ng
clas[s]{.mark} the world over, are [not a "choice"]{.mark} between
reform---the development [of]{.mark} "prog[re]{.mark}ssive
capitalism"--- and socialism. Rather, the two alternatives are
counter-revolution or the [f]{.mark}ight for s[o]{.mark}cialist
[r]{.mark}evolution, that is, the taking of political power by the
working class in order to end the domination of the financial oligarchy
and carry out the reorganisation of the entire economy to meet human
needs.]{.underline}

#### Reforms to the system distract from the Alt and allow for the continuation of Violence

John **Peterson**, 1-29-**19**, \"You Can't Reform Capitalism---It Must
Be Overthrown,\" In Defence of Marxism,
<https://www.marxist.com/you-can-t-reform-capitalism-it-must-be-overthrown.htm>
JI

Interest in socialism has skyrocketed over the last two years. Millions
of people yearn for change and want to fight back against capitalism.
They are looking for ideas and an organization that can help them do
just that. But there is as yet no viable point of reference, no mass
socialist party, no clear and confident exit indicated out of the
burning building. As a result, most people doubt whether a serious
challenge to the system and its institutions can be mounted, let alone
its total overturn. This explains the revival of interest in reformism.
As Marxists, we support any and all reforms that improve the lives of
the workers and poor, even within the limits of capitalism. But there is
a difference between fighting for concrete reforms that raise class
consciousness, confidence, and unity, and believing that capitalism can
be "reformed" out of existence. We do not content ourselves with a
"kinder, gentler" form of wage slavery. A system that cannot
productively make use of the diverse talents of every individual for the
greater good, and which condemns millions to "enforced idleness" has no
right to rule over the majority. [We should also understand that those
social welfare [programs that do exist are]{.mark} by-[products of
revolutionary struggle and are maintained]{.mark} solely [to
prevent]{.mark} the threat of [revolution]{.mark}.]{.underline} Our
historic aim is not to win a few more crumbs for the destitute, but to
ensure that everyone on the planet has food, clothing, shelter,
education, and long, productive, healthy lives. To be sure, reformism is
a natural first stage of political awakening. The idea that we should
try to tone down this or that "excess" of capitalism seems the only
"pragmatic" thing to do. But there is a difference between [the
reformism of the average person, who can't yet conceive of any system
that goes beyond what they have experienced so far in their lives, and
that of committed reformists who consciously reject the need for
revolution,]{.underline} or at best, postpone it to the indefinite
future. Having no confidence in themselves or the working class, they
eviscerate Lenin of his revolutionary essence and embrace the ideas of
the German Social-Democrat Karl Kautsky. [Ultimately, as with
[all]{.mark} utopian socialists and [reformists]{.mark}, their
[aim]{.mark} is [to "pressure" the capitalists and]{.mark} their
politicians [to "do the right thing." However, history
prov]{.mark}id[es]{.mark} ample evidence [that this is a dead
en]{.mark}d.]{.underline} As Leon Trotsky succinctly put it, "[No amount
of 'pressure' can make the bourgeoisie stop being the bourgeoisie: it
must be overthrown."]{.underline} Nevermind that in the midst of an
organic crisis of capitalism, there is no material basis for reforms,
only counterreforms. Some on the left believe they have stumbled upon a
"third way" between reformism and revolution. They propose that the way
forward lies in reviving the ideas of the "New Left," specifically,
those of André Gorz and his conception of "non-reformist reforms." [Now,
if what they mean by this is [a reform that doesn't limit itself to
cap]{.mark}italism, [cannot be fully realized]{.mark} within this
system, [and]{.mark} therefore [helps people draw the conclusion that a
socialist revolution is necessary]{.mark}, then this would effectively
be a classical Marxist "transitional demand" by another
name]{.underline}. But that's not what they mean. They envision reforms
that can somehow "decommodify" this or that strategic sector of the
capitalist economy, thus "undermining its hegemony," in a "war of
position" waged from within the limits of the system. Take, as an
example, the much-needed struggle for universal socialized healthcare.
[Those activists who fight for "Medicare for All" in the abstract---in
isolation from the broader fight for a mass socialist party and class
struggle trade unionism---end up merely trying to exert "pressure" on
capitalist politicians]{.underline}. Canvassing is an important way to
meet and engage workers and to explain the ideas of socialism[. But if
the concrete result is simply to get signatures for a petition "urging"
the Democrats to "do the right thing," then not a single step towards
universal healthcare is taken, never mind socialism]{.underline}. [The
Democrats are a party of big business. They are not about to
"decommodify" the health insurance and provision industries, which are
among the most profitable sectors of the capitalist
economy.]{.underline} To sow any illusions whatsoever in the Democratic
Party is to sow confusion and disappointment. Those who argue for
"non-reformist reforms" also have a formalistic understanding of what a
revolution is and is not. As a result, they focus on the so-called "war
of position" instead of prioritizing the building of a class-independent
mass revolutionary party in advance of the revolution. They have no
perspective of future mass movements of the workers, of a revival of the
class struggle in the unions and in politics. While critical of
capitalism, they don't fully explain the system or how it can be changed
through working-class organization, mobilization, and revolution. They
do not deny that the system is exhausted and reactionary, but they
grudgingly accept it nonetheless. This is a perspective of cynical
pessimism and surrender, veiled in the language of academic sagacity.
The idea that the workers are "not ready" for socialism is a cop-out.
Millions came out in support of Bernie Sanders's call for "revolution
against the billionaire class." It was his capitulation to the
Democratic Party that led to mass abstention, protest votes and the
eventual victory of Donald Trump, not a lack of enthusiasm for socialism
and revolution. Fortunately for humanity, working-class consciousness
can, does, and will catch up with a bang, and this will completely
transform the situation. When precisely this will happen is impossible
to say. But in society, as in nature, similar conditions lead to similar
results. The task of socialists is to painstakingly prepare for such
dramatic changes in consciousness. Our role is not to artificially try
to "build working class power" or "spark" the movement, but to prepare
ourselves to help channel the pent-up energy of the working class into
useful revolutionary change once it inevitably moves into action to
change society. We must also not forget that betrayal is inherent in
reformism. In one European country after another in the recent period,
the reformists have played the role of derailing revolutionary energy
into channels that are safe for capitalism, even before they get
anywhere near power. In an epoch of crisis and counterreforms,
"non-reformist reforms" will end up as run-of-the-mill reformism without
reforms. As Marxists, we must enter a friendly and patient dialogue with
those who have honest reformist illusions but aren't committed
reformists. Most Americans, even on the left, have never been presented
with a revolutionary socialist program. But illusions in reformism
cannot last forever. American workers are pragmatic by nature and will
judge parties and politicians on the basis of their experience. At a
certain stage, if revolutionary socialists are present in sufficient
numbers to reach the broader working class with our ideas, millions will
enthusiastically embrace the need for socialist revolution. The task of
Marxists is to help shorten the time needed to draw these
conclusions---but we do not have all the time in the world to do so.
That capitalism passes through different phases of development is
absolutely true. But to propose, as some on the left do, that it is only
a "neoliberal" version of capitalism that has failed is patently wrong.
Capitalism remains capitalism from its dynamic infancy to its senile
decay. It is predicated on the merciless exploitation of wage labor and
is more than happy to make use of even crueler modes of exploitation in
its relentless quest to accumulate, concentrate, and expand capital. To
argue for the continuation of any form of this system is to settle for a
status quo of poverty, ignorance, exploitation, and oppression. This at
a time when the objective potential for an entirely different way of
organizing society is abundantly evident. In essence, this is what is
meant by the concept of "late capitalism," which reflects the
instinctive understanding among the youth the "old society is pregnant
with the new." In an article titled, "How to Be an Anticapitalist
Today," published in Jacobin, the author concludes: "Give up the fantasy
of smashing capitalism. Capitalism is not smashable, at least if you
really want to construct an emancipatory future." The American workers
and youth can do without this kind of learned defeatism. A better future
may seem out of reach as the economic, political, and social crisis
grinds on, with even worse to come. But as the immortal revolutionary
John Brown expressed it, "I cannot remember a night so dark as to have
hindered the coming day, nor a storm so furious or dreadful as to
prevent the return of warm sunshine and a cloudless sky." That is the
sort of revolutionary optimism we must be filled with. As Leon Trotsky
explained, the crisis of humanity is the crisis of working-class
leadership. A bold leadership with a confident vision of the socialist
future is what we must build. History and the youth are on our side. The
sooner we get this over with, the sooner future generations will get to
live in a world of superabundance without the state, money, or
compulsion of any kind. Join the International Marxist Tendency and help
us fight for these ideas in the socialist movement.

### Russia Relations

#### US-Russia tensions push Russia and the PRC together now- the plan is a strategy of US imperialism to lure Russia into its own global aegis as during the Yeltsin years- we should refuse to allow the incorporation of resistance to U.S. imperialism

**Shi 19** \[Shi Jingtao, former diplomat and China reporter, *Is China
and Russia's 'marriage of convenience' Donald Trump's worst strategic
blunder?*, *South China Morning Post*, 8 June 2019, //Stefan\]

When US President Donald [Trump and his hawkish advisers singled out
Beijing and Moscow as "revisionist powers" and Washington's biggest
threat]{.underline} over a year ago, they may not have foreseen an
[alliance developing between the two countries against a common
foe]{.underline}. During his visit to Russia this week, Chinese
President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [and "best friend"]{.underline} and
counterpart Vladimir [Putin ushered in a new era for bilateral
ties]{.underline} between the two countries that were communist rivals
during the cold war. According to former diplomats and analysts, the
"[bromance]{.underline}" between the two leaders that has been splashed
across both countries' state-controlled media [is]{.underline} not just
[a show of resentment at Trump's big-stick diplomacy]{.underline}, but
of the geostrategic implications on the shifting global political and
economic order. Xi's three-day tour, his eighth official visit to Russia
since taking power in 2012, comes amid worsening tensions between China
and the United States over trade and technology. It has so far seen two
joint statements -- including one denouncing Trump's unilateral,
disruptive foreign policy -- and a raft of deals on natural gas,
security and technology worth more than US\$20 billion. "This year marks
the 70th anniversary of our diplomatic ties and China's ties with Russia
are deepening at a time of profound change in the global geopolitical
landscape," said Ma Zhengang, a former Chinese ambassador to Britain.
Ma, also former president of the China Institute of International
Studies in Beijing, said the so-called new era of China-Russia ties was
apparently a reference to the US' changing role in world affairs. "It
has steadily withdrawn from the global leadership role and waged an
offensive against China after years of hostility towards Russia. That
has given us new impetus to develop closer ties with Moscow," he said.
Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of
London, also said China's efforts to edge closer to Russia underlined
changes in their relations with the US. "The context has changed. The
restart of the trade war, the US measures against Huawei as well as
China's responses suggest that China and the US are entering a process
of decoupling, not only in the economic relationship but more
generally," Tsang said. "This implies a structural change in the global
strategic line-up. As this progresses, China under Xi will need to
strengthen its capacity to face the US and its allies. Putin's Russia
comes in handy in this context." In a series of meetings with Putin in
Moscow and St Petersburg, [Xi repeatedly said both countries stood at a
historical juncture in their pursuit of development and national
rejuvenation. As nuclear-armed powers, Xi said China and Russia should
boost cooperation, forge a stronger strategic partnership and fight
against "illicit moves to curb the development of emerging economies" at
a time of greater uncertainty.]{.underline} "Under the current
circumstances, the two sides should deepen strategic coordination, not
only to safeguard the interests of China and Russia, but also to defend
basic international norms and justice as well as world peace, security
and stability," the Chinese president said on Thursday. [Xi described
Putin, who he has met nearly 30 times, as "my best and bosom
friend"]{.underline}, which according to Katie Stallard-Blanchette, a
fellow at the Wilson Centre in Washington, [was "unusually
effusive".]{.underline} In a lengthy statement after talks between the
two leaders in Moscow on Wednesday, hailing a new era for bilateral
ties, both praised their frequent exchanges and upgraded relations.
Apart from listing [16 potential areas for future cooperation -- ranging
from Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative to joint space and Arctic
explorations -- almost half of the 10,000-word document focuses on their
shared approach to international crises and issues such as Iran, Syria
and North Korea]{.underline}. [In a second joint statement on countering
threats and challenges to international security, Xi and Putin were much
less restrained, naming the US directly about 10 times. They criticised
Washington's decision to withdraw from the]{.underline}
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty ([INF]{.underline}), a key cold
war-era arms control pact, saying it would "undermine strategic
stability". Xi and Putin also raised concern about the growing threat of
an arms race in space, calling for a legally binding international
agreement banning weapons in orbit. "A ban on deployment of any weapons
in space would avert a serious threat to global peace and security," the
statement said. Huawei signs deal to develop 5G in Russia, on sidelines
of Xi-Putin meeting Shi Ze, a former Chinese diplomat in Russia and a
senior fellow at the China Institute of International Studies in
Beijing, said [the statements set the tone for bilateral ties in the
years to come against the backdrop of Washington's deteriorating ties
with both China and Russia.]{.underline} "The strongly worded statement
lashing out at the US is fairly unusual and shows the urgency for
Beijing to join hands with Moscow on global issues that are considered
their core national interests," he said. "For China's part, it also
underlines the Chinese government's willingness and readiness to play a
leading role to counter efforts that will undermine the existing global
security structure." [Russia's ties with the US are at a low
point]{.underline}, with [Putin concerned about more sanctions from the
US and its allies over the crisis in Ukraine, the war in Syria and
allegations the Kremlin meddled in the 2016 US presidential
elections.]{.underline}

## Impacts

###  Bifo

#### Neoliberalism is an inhuman system -- absent immediate confronting, it expands endlessly. The world is capitulating, it's only a question of who takes control of the energy during collapse -- capitalism's erosion of meaning leaves fascism to fill in and enable endless violence against the periphery, environmental degradation, and the end of life as we know it.

**Bifo 16.** Franco "Bifo" Berardi, Italian post-autonomist activist,
artist, and theorist, professor of Social History of the Media at the
Accademia di Brera, "The Coming '17," e-flux journal #78 -- December
2016, http://www.e-flux.com/journal/78/82058/the-coming-17/

The hundredth anniversary of the Soviet Revolution will likely coincide
with a global collapse. The oft-announced recovery is not coming, and a
rightist wave with racist undertones is mounting. [[The collapse]{.mark}
of capitalism [will be]{.mark} interminable and enormously [destructive,
**as long as a new subjectivity does not emerge and a different social
model does not develop**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The subjectivity that in
the nineteenth century was expressed by the workers' movement appears
today so disintegrated that we cannot imagine any possible recomposition
in the near future]{.underline}. [The anti-financial uprisings of 2011
have not succeeded in reversing the route of financial plunder, and the
European leftist parties have accepted austerity politics, even if this
betrayal is likely to provoke their final defeat]{.underline}. [[The
dynamics that led to the ascent of the Nazis and]{.mark} then to [the
Second World War are back]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Contemporary
[nationalist parties]{.mark} are echoing what Hitler said to the
impoverished workers of Germany: you are not defeated and exploited
workers, but national warriors, and you will win**. They [did not win,
but they destroyed Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They will not win
this time either, but [they are poised to destroy the world.]{.mark}
[The]{.mark} ongoing [**impoverishment of society** is not a natural
necessity, but a consequence of the **politics of financial
accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The neoliberal model implements
itself by force of automatism, while consensus melts away]{.underline}.
The July 2016 issue of The Economist had the theme "Anarchy in the UK"
and admitted the bankruptcy of neoliberal globalism. [[The symptoms are
visible: stagnation; overproduction and]{.mark} then [deflation; looming
recession.]{.mark}]{.underline} The sources of stagnation and
unemployment---market saturation and the reduction of necessary labor
time---are not inherently negative trends in themselves. On the
contrary, from the perspective of social usefulness they prove that the
era of scarcity is over and the emancipation of human time from
repetitive work is imminent. The material basis now exists for people to
devote their time to the care of others, self-care, education, and other
non-market activities. [[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
**[[is semiotically unable to implement the potentialities inherent to
knowledge and technology]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [its dynamic tends in
fact to contain those potentialities within old frameworks of growth and
accumulation]{.underline}. Consequently, [[it transforms the
potentialities]{.mark} of knowledge and technology [into]{.mark} factors
of [scarcity and destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This distortion has
impoverished]{.mark} European [society and is **unleashing an antiglobal
reaction that is feeding resentment, fascism, and
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. What will happen next? 1917 Will Not Happen
Again [In the age of bio-info-political power, the Winter Palace is
empty]{.underline}. But [we must revisit 1917]{.underline}, because the
Soviet Revolution established the paradigm that presided over the
political landscape of the last century: the working class organized via
political parties into a social vanguard, seeking to seize central power
and use it against the capitalist class. [The vision that Lenin
expressed in his writings]{.underline} (particularly in What Is To Be
Done?) [provided a military framework for class struggle]{.underline}.
This tactical move allowed the Bolshevik party to seize power, but [this
was also Lenin's strategic mistake, and maybe his crime. The Leninist
party gave birth to a state and an army, but Lenin's determination
**turned class struggle into war**]{.underline}, thereby [suffocating
the processes of revolutionary autonomy in Germany, Italy, and also in
the United States, where the Industrial Workers of the World were
expanding their social organization.]{.underline} In order to win the
war unleashed by the Leninist revolution, Western capitalism fomented
fascism against the working class. We know the story of what followed:
[Soviet communism and Anglo-American capitalism were forced into an
alliance]{.underline}. Then [democracy defeated the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. In the second half of the century, [democracy
emerged as the winning mythology, but its triumph did not
last]{.underline}. [Beginning in Chile on September 11, 1973, the
neoliberal reformation started cancelling democracy, and went on to
cancel democracy everywhere else (including in Greece in July
2015]{.underline}). The dictatorship of the abstract over concrete life
emerged under the label of neoliberal governance, which thrived more or
less peacefully until the end of the '90s. Since the dot-com crash of
spring 2000 and the new September 11 of the first year of the new
century, the global landscape has fragmented into countless conflicting
identities that are now exploding into a global civil war. Colonialism
and Internationalism Zbigniew [Brzezinski]{.underline}, former adviser
to US president Jimmy Carter, has written important books about the
global political landscape. In 1993 he [published Out of Control: Global
Turmoil on the Eve of the 21st Century, a book in which he subverted the
prevailing optimism of that period and **predicted the uncontrollable
proliferation of identitarian conflict**]{.underline}. In a recent issue
of The American Interest, [Brzezinski published an essay entitled
"Toward a Global Realignment." Notwithstanding the flavorless title, the
article contains a dramatic consideration that may be summarized as
follows: **[after centuries of colonial domination]{.mark} and violence,
the former [colonies are asking for]{.mark} a moral and economic
[restitution that the West is unwilling and unable to
pay]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The concrete historical debt we own to those
we have exploited cannot be paid because we are forced to pay our
abstract financial debts. Brzezinski's style in the essay is elegant,
but his words are appalling and unequivocal. He deserves to be quoted at
length: [Special [attention should be focused on the non-Western
world's]{.mark} newly [politically aroused masses]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Long-repressed political memories are fuelling]{.mark} in large part
the sudden and very [explosive awakening]{.mark} energised by Islamic
extremists in the Middle East, but what is happening in the Middle East
today may be just the beginning of a wider phenomenon to come out of
Africa, Asia, and even among the pre-colonial peoples of the Western
Hemisphere in the years ahead]{.underline}. [[Periodic massacres]{.mark}
of their not-so-distant ancestors [by colonists]{.mark} and associated
wealth-seekers largely from Western Europe]{.underline} (countries that
today are, still tentatively at least, most open to multiethnic
cohabitation) [[resulted]{.mark} within the past two or so [centuries in
the slaughter of colonised peoples on a scale comparable to Nazi World
War II crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}: **[literally [involving]{.mark}
hundreds of thousands and even [millions of
victims]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Political self-assertion enhanced by
delayed outrage and grief is a powerful force that is now surfacing,
thirsting for revenge, not just in the Muslim Middle East but also very
likely beyond. In the sixteenth century, due largely to disease brought
by Spanish explorers, [the population of the native Aztec Empire in
present-day Mexico declined from 25 million to approximately one
million]{.underline}. Similarly, [in North America, an estimated 90
percent of the native population died within the first five years of
contact with European settlers]{.underline}, due primarily to diseases.
In the 19th century, [various wars and forced resettlements killed an
additional 100,000]{.underline}. In India from 1857--1867, the British
are suspected of killing up to one million civilians in reprisals
stemming from the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The British East India
Company's use of Indian agriculture to grow opium then essentially
forced on China resulted in the premature deaths of millions, not
including the directly inflicted Chinese casualties of the First and
Second Opium Wars. In the Congo, which was the personal holding of
Belgian King Leopold II, 10--15 million people were killed between 1890
and 1910. In Vietnam, recent estimates suggest that between one and
three million civilians were killed from 1955 to 1975. [As to the Muslim
world in Russia's Caucasus, from 1864 and 1867, 90 percent of the local
Circassian population was forcibly relocated and between 300,000 and 1.5
million either starved to death or were killed]{.underline}. [Between
1916 and 1918, tens of thousands of Muslims were killed]{.underline}
when 300,000 Turkic Muslims were forced by Russian authorities through
the mountains of Central Asia and into China. [In
Indonesia]{.underline}, between 1835 and 1840, [the Dutch occupiers
killed an estimated 300,000 civilians]{.underline}. In Algeria,
following a 15-year civil war from 1830--1845, [French brutality,
famine, and disease killed 1.5 million Algerians]{.underline}, **[nearly
half the population]{.underline}**. In neighboring Libya, the Italians
forced Cyrenaicans into concentration camps, where an estimated 80,000
to 500,000 died between 1927 and 1934. More recently, [in Afghanistan
between 1979 and 1989 the Soviet Union is estimated to have killed
around one million civilians; two decades later, the United States has
killed 26,000 civilians during its 15-year war in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. **[[In Iraq, 165,000 civilians have been
killed]{.mark} by the United States and its allies in the past 13
years]{.underline}**. (**[The disparity between the reported number of
deaths inflicted by European colonisers compared with the United States
and its allies in Iraq and Afghanistan may be due in part to the
technological advances that have resulted in the more productive use of
force and in part as well to a shift in the world's normative
climate]{.underline}**.) **[Just as shocking as the scale of these
atrocities is how quickly the West forgot about them]{.underline}**.1 I
agree with Brzezinski's diagnosis, but he forgets to say that in the
twentieth century, [internationalism emerged as a way to avert the kind
of global conflict he describes]{.underline}. Only the workers'
internationalist sentiment could avoid a planetary bloodbath. But
[communism has been defeated]{.underline}, and [the internationalist way
has dissolved]{.underline}. [[We now face a war of all against all for
the sake of nothing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

###  Environment

#### Capitalism's drive and desire for endless consumption is deleterious for the impact of the climate -- The environment falls prey to the compulsive market behavior that drive the capitalist mode of production 

**Movahed 16** (Masoud is a Researcher in development economics at New
York University. He contributes to, among others, Harvard Economics
Review, Yale Journal of International Affairs and Al Jazeera English.
"Does capitalism have to be bad for the environment," World Economic
Forum, 2-15-16,
<https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/02/does-capitalism-have-to-be-bad-for-the-environment/>)

[[Ecologists and environmental scientists often take "overpopulation"
and the subsequent exploitation of natural resources as the point of
departure in their prognoses of environmental
crises]{.mark}.]{.underline} While refusing to look beyond what seems to
be the roots of the malaise, they argue that overpopulation compounded
with unbridled industrial activity leads to environmental disasters such
as global warming, climate change, acid deposition, soil degradation,
air and water pollution[. [There is no denying that overpopulation, and
indeed, the massive industrial outputs of both developed and developing
countries, do have irrevocably deleterious impact on the climate. But
what is often omitted in their diagnoses is the environmental hazards
inherent to the dynamics of capitalism as a universal economic
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} Capitalism - defined as production for
profit for a competitive market - is an economic system in which the
private profit-maximization motif lies at the core of its virtues and
maladies[. Its virtues are embedded in its impressive productivity and
growth rates. The profit-maximization logic induces the producers to
specialize in what they are best at producing and invest in the latest
technologies to increase productivity and efficiency.]{.underline} The
profit-maximization motif also provides incentives for entrepreneurs to
increase productivity on a large scale to optimize profit. The same
profit-maximization motif, too, enables economic agents to allocate
resources in such ways that are conducive to growth and dynamism.
[[Compelled by the competitive force of the market, firms find it
rational to invest in cost-cutting technologies, which allow them to
resist the pressure that comes for their peers in the marketplace. This
altogether leads to a virtuous cycle of efficiency, productivity, and
optimized profit. Examples of success in terms of growth rates are
numerous in the modern history of capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
massive industrial development of England in the 18th and 19th
centuries, the United States as early capitalist developers prior to the
two devastating World Wars, the remarkable growth of rates western
Europe (i.e. Germany, France, Italy,) in the post-war era followed by
Japan in the last half a century, the rise of the East Asian Tigers and,
of course more recently, the Chinese leviathan are the conspicuous
examples of stunning economic development in contemporary capitalism. So
what is the problem? After all, if capitalism has been very successful
in projecting itself as the engine of productivity and growth, why
should it be blamed for environmental disasters[? It is herein that the
very core dynamics of capitalism that generate its virtues, also cause
its maladies. Capitalism requires endless growth of production in order
to remain stable, raise the standards of living, and produce ample
employment for the young and increasing world population. Production
itself is contingent on consumption. [Without sufficient consumption,
which creates more demands for production, the production cycle would be
paralyzed. Consumption is thus the flip side of the coin of a thriving
production cycle. But while capitalism stimulates tremendous
productivity rates, it biases productivity towards more consumption to
ensure that the production process is not impeded. Therefore, mass
consumption - or consumerism - is not merely a cultural
phenomenon.]{.mark} It is embedded in the core tenets of capitalism as
an economic system.]{.underline} The higher consumption, the higher
production, the higher production, the higher sales, and with higher
sales, higher profits are generated, which are largely re-invested in
the sustainability of the firm or the business-unit. But if we live in a
finite planet with limited ecological and natural resources that ought
to be preserved for sustainability purposes, how than, can we resolve
this contradiction? [If the carrying capacity of the world cannot
sustain endless consumption and production, there is clearly a
contradiction at stake here[. This contradiction naturally raises the
more important question: how to reconcile the quandary of maintaining a
capitalist system that meets necessary growth rates to remain stable on
the one hand, and simultaneously contain the environmental hazards that
threaten our planet on the other?]{.mark}]{.underline} To answer these
questions, there are three propositions about the very nature and
dynamics of capitalism that have to be examined. First, firms in a
capitalist setting are under enormous pressure to cut costs, because if
they don't, their competitors will. Since their competitors cut costs to
be able to reinvest in the firm's growth and thereby, become more
competitive, if one firm refrains from doing so, it will be soon pushed
out of the market by others. As the economic sociologist Erik Wright of
the University of Wisconsin-Madison said, one way of cutting cost is to
project some of that cost onto the environment. Imagine, for instance,
throwing a can of soft drink from a car window because this is a
low-cost way of disposing of a can, and being totally indifferent to its
negative impact on others[. The same behaviour is often adopted by large
businesses. [The market dynamics in capitalism do not provide any
mechanisms in themselves to prevent this behaviour; it requires some
forms of non-market intervention either by state or by organized social
forces. States have shown that they are reluctant to or deliberately
ignore taking measures against this.]{.mark}]{.underline} In democratic
countries, however, social forces are given relative freedom to organize
around this cause. Social activists with a whole slew of interests -
including the environment - usually take it upon themselves to draw
public attention to this issue. [Through mass organization,
environmentalists can pressure the state to impose certain regulations
on firms to conduct activities that are less detrimental to the
environment. Secondly, the price of non-renewable natural resources
under capitalism is usually organized around relatively short-term
horizons with almost no account of the future value of these finite
resources]{.underline}. The rate of greenhouse gas emissions into the
atmosphere has increased sharply since the mid-1990s, driven mainly by
strong economic growth in developing countries that often consume
massive natural resources such as oil, gas, and other minerals. China
and India have grown rapidly in the past two decades and the bedrock of
development in their industrial settings are non-renewable natural
resources, which happen to generate one of the highest rates of carbon
gas emissions. Non-renewable natural resources are often underpriced
since their future value is not accounted for in the dynamics of supply
and demand. In an influential study for the World Bank, Margaret Slade
shows in great detail [[that the enormous negative "externality" -
negative impact - that's inflicted onto the environment as a result of
extraction, production, and the use of minerals is largely due to
underpricing those natural resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} Which is to
say, the massive minerals consumption that's responsible for a large
fraction of world pollution are not taken into account in the prices
that they are offered in the market. The upshot is that buyers tend to
overconsume these resources. The fluctuating price of oil that's
produced by the Persian Gulf States is the most telling example. Source:
World Resources Institute What can be done? As I alluded earlier, the
architecture of market under a capitalist setting does not provide any
mechanisms to counter the environmental hazards that the large-scale
production and consumption processes inflict on the environment. Hence,
there have to be non-market interventions to contain or reduce
environmental damages. [[This non-market intervention can be either
state or social forces. Of course, one could argue that it is state's
responsibility to regulate this inimical behaviour of the firms against
the environment by heavily taxing those firms that violate the
environmental regulations that the state sets in
place.]{.underline}]{.mark} But the problem is that states in democratic
and non-democratic countries alike often overlook this, or deliberately
neglect it due to the pressure that comes from the influential business
groups. In most countries, the state is subservient to the bindings of
the influential business groups. The state needs to provide incentives
for business groups to ensure that they remain as dynamic as possible to
ensure economic growth and ample employment opportunities. So the state
on its own would be reluctant to take measures that might reduce the
profit rates of business-groups for the sake of the environment. Take
for instance the Chinese or the Indian states who are totally oblivious
to the environmental disasters around the industrial settings in those
countries. Hence, obliging the states to intervene is going to be a
challenge. Individual firms, too, do not have an incentive to oversee
regulations that protect the environment because they are compelled to
maximize profit under the tremendous pressure of market competition.
There remains another form of non-market intervention, which is social
forces. In democratic states people enjoy a certain level of freedom for
social activism. Thus, in democratic states, environmental activists can
form disruptive movements that seriously demand far more stringent
regulations to save the environment. In some cases, they may be able to
compel the state to impose restrictions on the firms and inspect them
regularly. This seems to be a viable option, but the responsibility to
organize around the cause will be endured by the activists to organize
massive public demonstrations to pressure the state and the firms.
International cooperation is also key for effective abatement. But
achieving meaningful international cooperation has proven to be a hard
task. Even though nations have a common interest in preventing climate
change, many are reluctant to reduce carbon emissions voluntarily. The
recent Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in which 195 countries adopted
the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal, is indeed
a very positive move towards international cooperation to protect the
planet. In short, the market mechanisms under capitalism do not provide
incentives for preserving the environment. Firms are constantly
threatened by market competition to cut costs and optimize profit. [[The
environment thus falls pray to the compulsive market behaviour of the
capitalist mode of production. Without the intervention of non-market
entities such as the state, international organizations and social
forces, capitalism as an economic system simply will not safeguard our
planet.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Capitalism causes environmental collapse -- The uncontrollable expansion of capitalism disrupts the ecological equilibrium and depletes resources in the name of wealth

**Broumas 17** Antonis "Ecological Struggles in the Neoliberal era,"
Resilience,
[https://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-10-27/ecological-struggles-neoliberal-era/)](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-10-27/ecological-struggles-neoliberal-era/)-)

[[Growth is a social phenomenon intertwined, on the one hand, with
natural degradation and, on the other hand, with domination and
exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Any productive activity has not only
positive but also negative externalities upon nature and human
capacities, metabolizing and consuming the latter in its process of
production. [[The uncontrollably expansive production of capitalism
deepens and intensifies the repercussions upon nature and society. In
the context of capitalist societies, production is inextricably
connected with anti-production.]{.underline}]{.mark} In terms of nature,
as Vandana Shiva comments, "\[w\]hen sustenance is the organizing
principle of society's relationship with nature, nature exists as a
commons. It only becomes a resource when profits and capital
accumulation become the organizing principles and create an imperative
for the exploitation of resources for the market" (Shiva 2010 : 239).
[In terms of labour, as Maurizio Lazzarato writes, "\[a\]t the same time
as it produces wealth, capitalism necessarily produces misery and
poverty \[...\] growth is a perverse solution to the social question and
to the problem of justice, for growth is simultaneously production and
destruction]{.underline}" (Lazzarato 2013 : 57-8). The process of
capitalist growth should be viewed as a process of undermining the
general sources of wealth, i.e. nature and human productive activity.
[[As a result, the more capitalist societies pledge on ideologies of
infinite growth the greater relations of domination and exploitation
intensify, deepen and multiply.]{.mark} In this sense, capital becomes a
machine of destructive social power so efficient that mankind has never
seen before, a machine of destruction which needs to be smashed by
social counter-power under conditions of radical emancipatory and
democratic transformation. In processes of capitalist domination,
destruction comes first and production follows.]{.underline} The first
act of commodity market expansion is the enclosure of the commons[.
[Commodification is a moment of destruction and radical transformation
towards societies dominated by capital.]{.mark}]{.underline} At the
moment of enclosure communal forms of life and governance of means of
sustenance are annihilated and replaced by circuits of commodities and
money, practices of economic exchange for profit, ethics of
individuality and the violent monopolization of the political sphere by
the state. What is also destroyed is the abundance of the means of
sustenance for whole populations, previously guaranteed by social
practices of sharing and pooling together. As Pierre Clastres and
Marshall Sahlins have proven, communities within the commons reject the
assumption of scarcity and adhere to rationalities of sharing, mutual
aid, sustenance and symbiosis with nature in the allocation and
consumption of available resources (Clastres 2010, Sahlins 1972). [On
the contrary, the starting point of bourgeois economics is the efficient
management of scarce resources. Commodity markets are based on the
construction and allocation of scarcity and inequality among social
agents]{.underline}. In the words of Vandana Shiva, "\[the\] diversion
to the market economy generates a condition of scarcity for ecological
stability and creates new forms of poverty for people" (Shiva 2010 :
240). The construction of scarcity under the dominance of capital takes
place in two phases. **[[At the phase of the enclosure, populations are
separated from the means of their subsistence and communal forms of life
are ideologically degraded and violently dismantled. At this phase,
societies fall under the reign of capital but still preserve great parts
of their reproduction under the sphere of the commons. At the phase of
ecological disequilibrium, ancillary crises are countered by the
expansion of processes of commodification to most facets of social
reproduction.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This is the moment when capital
replaces pre-existing natural and social cycles of reproduction with
artificial circuits of reproduction according to its image, i.e. the
construction of commodity markets in terrains which were previously
commons. For instance, [[the repercussions of climate change have
created novel needs in order to make lives bearable again, such as the
widespread use of air-conditioning appliances and bottled water. Through
this vicious circle the attainment of basic needs and every-day desires
is all the more penetrated by the commodity and the logic of capital
accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}. After all, for capital ecological
disequilibrium and catastrophe just means new markets and more profits.
In corollary, in terms of the degree of social dependence to capital,
the first phase marks the formal and the second the real subsumption of
societies under capital.

**The desire for capital without end results in the devastation and
collapse of the environment**

**Magdoff 12** Fred Magdoff, Professor emeritus of plant and soil
science at the Unviersity of Vermont, "Harmony and Ecological
Civilization," Monthly Review, June 2012, Vol. 64, Issue 2, p. 1-9

There is an overriding issue when considering harmony as I have briefly
described it. **[[Harmony in the world---among its
people]{.underline}]{.mark}** and between humans **[[and the rest of the
ecosystems---is not possible in the context of
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
system that has been in existence for some 500 years (merchant
capitalism for approximately 250 years and industrial capitalism for
about 250 years)---a relatively short time in the 150,000 year history
of anatomically modern humans---[[has shown that it fosters
interpersonal relations and metabolic interactions with the earth that
are detrimental to achieving a harmonious
existence.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is a result of capitalism's basic
characteristics and the relationships it creates as it normally
functions. The purpose of capitalism is not to satisfy human needs and
preserve the environment. [[There is only one purpose and driving
force]{.underline}]{.mark}---ultimately responsible for both its dynamic
periods and its crises and long periods of slow growth
(stagnation)---[[and that is the accumulation of capital without
end]{.mark}.]{.underline} The capitalist system has a number of basic
characteristics and also fosters specific human characteristics and
relationships. Here are ten key aspects of capitalism[[: It has to
grow]{.underline}]{.mark} (or else it is in crisis) and its very logic
and motivating force impels growth. It has no other driving force than
[[the accumulation of ever greater amounts of
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}. Through the creation of so-called
"externalities" (or side effects) it wreaks damage on humans as well as
the ecosystem and the life support systems needed by humanity and other
species. In Paul Sweezy's words: ["As far as the natural environment is
concerned, capitalism perceives it not as something to be cherished and
enjoyed but as a means to the paramount ends of profit-making and still
more capital
accumulation.]{.underline}"[1](https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization/#en1)
It promotes the use of nonrenewable resources without regard to the
needs of future generations, as if there was no end to them, and abuses
even renewable resources such as ocean fisheries and forests. It creates
vast inequality in income, wealth, and power both within and between
countries. Not only class, but race, gender, and other inequalities are
built into its laws of motion. [It requires and produces a reserve army
of labor---people precariously connected to the economy, most kept in
poverty or near poverty---so that labor is available during economic
upswings and workers can easily be fired when not needed by
businesses.]{.underline} It promotes national economic and political
competition and imperialism, leading to wars for domination and access
to resources. It fosters and rewards those particular human traits that
are useful for thriving or even just existing in such a
possessive-individualist society---[selfishness, individualism,
competition, greed, exploitation of others, consumerism---while not
allowing the full expression of those human characteristics needed for a
harmonious society]{.underline} (cooperation, sharing, empathy, and
altruism). It leads to the breakdown of human health since people
operate in a hierarchical society, with many working under dangerous and
physically debilitating conditions or in jobs that are repetitive and
boring---while subject to job loss or fear of losing their job. (There
are many adverse long-term health effects following the loss of one's
job.)[2](https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization/#en2)
It leads to the breakdown of healthy communities as people become more
solitary in outlook and behavior and indigenous culture is replaced by
the dominant national or international capitalist culture and outlook.
People become dedicated to obtaining more for themselves and their
families and depending less on reciprocal relationships with others.
[T[he growth imperative of capitalism deserves special attention because
it is one of the major stumbling blocks with respect to harmony between
humans and the environment. Accumulation without end means using ever
greater quantities of resources]{.underline}]{.mark}---without
end---even as we find ways to use resources more efficiently. [An
economy growing at the very meager rate of 1 percent a year will double
in about seventy-two years, but one growing at 2 percent a
year]{.underline}, still a low rate, will double in size in thirty-six
years. And when growing at 3 and 4 percent, economies will double in
twenty-four and eighteen years respectively. China recently has seen
recorded growth rates of up to 10 percent, meaning economic output
doubles at a rate of approximately every seven years! Yet, we are
already using up resources far too fast from the one planet we
have---depleting the stocks of nonrenewable resources rapidly and
misusing and overusing resources that are theoretically "renewable." If
the world's economy doubles within the next twenty to thirty years this
can only hasten the descent into ecological, and probably societal,
chaos and destruction[[. Thus capitalism promotes the processes,
relationships, and outcomes that are precisely the opposite of those
needed for an ecologically sound, just, harmonious
society.]{.underline}]{.mark} In the alienated ideology and practice of
bourgeois society, Marx and Engels noted in The German Ideology, "the
relation of man to nature is excluded from history and hence the
antithesis of man to nature is created." Proletarians thus had the
historical task of bringing their "'existence' into harmony with their
'essence' in a practical way, by means of a revolution" (italics
added).[3](https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization/#en3)
Only in this way could they reestablish a harmonious connection to
nature and to their own production. That Marx and Engels were referring
directly to the early stages of what we now call the ecological crisis
is indicated by the following: "The 'essence' of the fish is its
'being,' water---to go no further than this one proposition. The
'essence' of the freshwater fish is the water of a river. But the latter
ceases to be the 'essence' of the fish and is no longer a suitable
medium of existence as soon as the river is made to serve industry, as
soon as it is polluted by dyes and other waste products and navigated by
steamboats, or as soon as its water is diverted into canals where simple
drainage can deprive the fish of its medium of
existence."[4](https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization/#en4)

ME.

Four centuries ago, somebody starving in the drought afflicted Elbe
region in what is today the Czech Republic, anonymously chiseled onto
the stone of the receding river bank a warning. Here, along the river
where one day American and Soviet troops would meet on their duel
approach to Berlin, a graffito made by unknown hand marks 1616 as the
oldest year recorded on one particular "Hunger Stone", and on that
surface there is a memento mori which reads "Wenn du mich sicht, dann
weine." This summer, among the hottest recorded, and the Elbe once again
receded to the point where observers could read that ominous missive:
"If you see me, weep." Something to tattoo on the brain with the Monday
release of the United Nations Intergovernmental Report on Climate
Change. Authored by 91 scientists, representing 40 countries and based
on over 6,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies, the conclusions of the
commission are horrifying. According to Coral Davenport at the New York
Times the climatologists discovered that if "greenhouse gas emissions
continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as
2.7 degrees Fahrenheit" by 2040, radically earlier than had been
thought, meaning that most readers of this article will bear witness to
"inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty." **[[A
child born today will have just turned the drinking age in a world
where]{.mark} close to all of the [coral reefs will be extinct]{.mark}
and where [massive storms like]{.mark} Hurricane Florence or Hurricane
[Maria]{.mark}, which has nearly destroyed a Puerto Rico abandoned by
the government of the United States, [will be common]{.mark}. Where the
social, cultural, and economic affects of climate change will be
recorded not on revealed hunger stones, but [in pandemics, wars,
famines, and genocides]{.mark} exacerbated by the effects of higher
temperatures.]{.underline}** Brandon Miller and Jay Croft at CNN write
that we'll see in starker detail the horrific results of industrial
man-made global warming earlier than in two decades, with the report
concluding that humanity has "only till 2030 to stem catastrophic
climate change." Alterations to human behavior which might hasten the
worst effects of climate change are technically possible, though the
study's authors doubt such change is politically feasible, as it would
require direct action on the part of the industrial economies of the
world, something with "no documented historic precedent." Myles Allen of
Oxford University explained that "we need to reverse emissions trends
and turn the world economy on a dime" if we're to stave off an
ecological apocalypse which we now understand isn't centuries in the
future, but rather mere decades, if not years. We already see the
effects in the increasing ferocity of storms, the droughts that mark not
just the developing world, but increasingly North America and Europe,
and in the wildfires, which have burnt their way across the west. As the
world's temperature rises we see an equivalent political slow burn,
nations increasingly moving toward the delusional reactionary
nationalisms as a means of punishing refugee populations often affected
either directly by climate change or by the civil strife made possible
by it, for as Mark Fishcetti describes the Syrian civil war in
Scientific American, "Human-induced drying in many societies can push
tensions over a threshold that provokes violent conflict" -- a reality
that if the Trump administration pretends to deny, has long been
acknowledged by the Pentagon. Climate change has resulted in
civilizational catastrophe before. Historian John Kelly notes in The
Great Mortality, his book on the Black Death of fourteenth-century
Europe, that pestilence was furthered by "climactic and ecological
instability," the bubonic plague encouraged by weakened immune systems
brought on by drought and famine. Polymathic anthropologist Jared
Diamond has considered how climate change brought collapse in cultures
as varied as the Anasazi and Maya or the medieval Norse settlements of
Greenland, writing that the "collapse of industrial civilization...
could assume various forms, such as the worldwide spread of diseases or
else of wars, triggered ultimately by scarcity of environmental
resources." Arguably the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia and the
Indus River Valley were felled by climate change, and one wonders if the
peasants of Sumer were as despondent as that German speaker on the Elbe
who asked future generations to weep, or if they were rather as myopic
as we are, saying of such changes that "This too shall pass" while what
expires is civilization itself? Humans are unable to imagine the actual
passing of their way of life. A sense that history changes has been
novel for most cultures, even apocalyptic minded ones, as medieval
paintings which depict Christ as a Flemish peasant or ancient Judeans as
Florentine nobleman can attest. The idea that the past was radically
different from the present and that tomorrow will be distant from today
is an innovation of Renaissance humanism and then modernity. Rather,
it's always been easier to imagine that your world will literally pass
into oblivion than that the values your civilization holds dear might
disappear (or need to disappear). During those lean times on the Indus
River, on the Euphrates, or the Elbe, women and men may have dreamt of
the end of days, but they couldn't have quite dreamt of us. The myths
that structured their world precluded it. Lest we be too arrogant, ours
is not so different a perspective, for as the literary theorist Frederic
Jameson famously noted, it is "easier to imagine the end of the world
than to imagine the end of capitalism." Similar for the hungry penitent
in the temple to all the gods of Sumer, or to the starving medieval
pilgrim who could envision the return of Christ, but not that he might
look different from those who populated his world. Limited perspective
is the wage of any totalizing ideology, and all eras are structured by
such paradigms. As a priest in Moloch's temple or a monk in a medieval
monastery had their religions, so have we ours, but the cracked gods of
our world differ in one important respect -- only capitalism's Mammon
has the capability of bringing about the apocalypse. **[Only capitalism
was able to inaugurate a new geological epoch in the Anthropocene;
unique is our dominant ideology's status in being able to obliterate all
of humanity. IPCC Co-Chair Debra Roberts said that the report is a "line
in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment
and we must act now," but what should disturb us most is the authors'
accurate alarm at the lack of political will to avert catastrophe. In
the United States the coal, oil, and gas industries' obfuscate, high
percentages of Americans believe the lie that climate change is a hoax
(while record heat affects the Midwest this October), and the Trump
administration trashes the Paris Accords.]{.underline}** Noam Chomsky
has said that the Republican "party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as
possible to destruction of organized human life. There is no historical
precedent for such a stand," with modern fascism directly correlated to
the increasing chaos of climate change itself. Roy Scranton in We're
Doomed. Now What? writes that as the "gap between the future we're
entering and the future we once imagined grows ever wider, nihilism
takes root in the shadow of our fear.... **[\[Y\]ou can see it in the
[pull to nationalism, sectarianism, war, and racial hatred]{.mark}. We
see it in the election of Donald Trump." What must be reckoned with is
how [this situation was directly engendered by industrial
capitalism]{.mark}, and [in particular by the]{.mark} partisans of its
[most extreme ideological manifestations of libertarianism and
neoliberalism]{.mark} who have provided cover for policies that have
enflamed the crisis. Past centuries were circumscribed by their
worldviews, be it medieval Catholicism, or classical Roman Augustan
paganism, or the varied gods of Sumer in ancient Mesopotamia. Even the
most visionary of individual perspectives must be limited by a culture's
dominant way of thinking, but while [our adherence to the market]{.mark}
is as all-encompassing as a Babylonian's loyalty to Marduk, it is only
our dark religion which actually [threatens Armageddon]{.mark}.
Unfettered, unregulated, capricious, [vampiric capitalism has brought us
to the brink]{.mark}, [and the mass inability to comprehend this]{.mark}
fact [evidences how ingrained said ideology is]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Our blinders are such that human tragedy that is attributable directly
to our economic system is often naturalized as simply being "The way
that things are," thus precluding even the possibility of different ways
of arranging our world. Deathdue to differing ideologies is always
interpreted as conscious and preventable, but capitalist tragedy is
simply understood as how life operates. Consideration of those who have
died because of capitalism (and those who will, which may yet include us
all) doesn't require a cover-up**[. So inured are we to seeing
capitalism as its own imposed ideology that we fail to understand its
death toll. Franco-Bulgarian philosopher Tzvetan Todorovwrote that
"remembrance of our own woes prevents us from seeing the suffering of
others," and while true, the converse is also accurate]{.underline}**.
While admitting that capitalism provided for unprecedented class
mobility and technological innovation, an honest consideration of its
death toll in any hypothetical Black Book of Capitalism would have to
include not just the obvious fatalities of those who died in industrial
accidents or whose lives were shortened by their labor, but indeed the
victims of colonialism, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and of fascismo
corporativo, which is simply capitalism driven to its horrifying end
Invisibility of such atrocities through normalization is a species of
what the philosopher Louis Althusser termed "interpellation," that is to
say that we're all molded subjects of the ideology that governs our
world so that we mostly hold uncritical assumptions about capitalism's
normativity. Writer William T. Vollmann addresses future generations in
his new tome on climate change Carbon Ideologies, explaining that "We
all lived for money, and that is what we died for." **[[As 2040
approaches our ignorance is]{.mark} a form of [collective
suicide.]{.mark} The Editorial Board of theWashington Post writes that
future "Historians will look in absolute astonishment" that not only did
our governments and corporate elite fail to halt climate change, but
that our policy makers "actually pushed in the wrong direction." That's
[assuming that there will even be any]{.mark} historians [left after the
climate change horseman of pestilence]{.mark}, famine, war, and death
gallop across the scorched and burning world, their riders named
"Deregulation," "Bottom Line," "Market," and "Profit." An August
environmental impact statement prepared by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration concedes that far from being a "Chinese hoax" as
Trump has alleged, the average temperature will rise seven degrees by
century's end. Quite a wide gulf between what the Trump administration
knows to be true and what his deluded believers will
swallow]{.underline}**. Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis, and Chris Mooney
at the Washington Post write that the Trump "administration did not
offer this dire forecast ... as part of an effort to combat climate
change," for their "analysis assumes the planet's fate is already
sealed**[." [Why prevent collapse when]{.mark} Trump concludes that
[there is]{.mark} still so much [money to be made]{.mark} in not
averting disaster? [This is the nightmare logic of scarcity
capitalism]{.mark}, the macabre calculus which is content to let
millions of people starve in the third world and that will ultimately
exterminate refugees who dare to escape a parched landscape, all [so
that the economic status quo can be maintained before the process kills
us all]{.mark}. The puritanism of corporate eco-individualism which
configures environmental protection as simply a matter of driving a
Prius or taking short showers is moral contrition or personal branding
rather than policy, a quasi-theological sacrifice before the altar of
the dying Earth. [What's]{.mark} actually [required is a massive,
international, eco-socialist mobilization of governments]{.mark} and
industries [that are responsible for this
calamity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Because right now capitalism's final
solution is nothing less than complete ecological collapse. In his 1888
autobiographical Ecce Homo, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche
eerily predicted that the 20th century would witness "wars as have never
happened on earth." With chaos brought about by the scarcity resulting
from climate change, we may reevaluate how prescient Nietzsche was about
the last century, realizing that he was perhaps actually off by a
hundred years.

###  Extinction By 2050

#### Racialized capitalism requires the very environmental exploitation and structural violences that undermine its own stability. This collapse will come by 2050 and cause extinction absent radical recalibration.

**Streeck 16** (Wolfgang, Emeritus Director of the Max-Planck-Institute
for the Study of Societies, Cologne, *How Will Capitalism End?: Essays
on a Failing System*, p. 1-15)

[[Capitalism has]{.mark} always [been]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}an
improbable social formation, full of conflicts and contradictions,
therefore [**[permanently unstable]{.mark}** and in flux]{.underline},
and highly conditional on historically contingent and precarious
supportive as well as constraining events and institutions. [Capitalist
society]{.underline} may be described in shorthand as a \'progressive\'
society in the sense of Adam Smith 1 and the enlightenment, a society
that has [coupled its \'progress\' to the continuous and unlimited
production and accumulation of]{.underline} productive [capital,
effected through]{.underline} a conversion, by means of [the invisible
hand of the market and the visible hand of the state]{.underline}, of
the private vice of material greed into a public benefit.\' [[Capitalism
promises **infinite growth**]{.underline}]{.mark} of commodified
material wealth [[in a finite world]{.mark}, by conjoining itself with
modern science and technology]{.underline}, making capitalist society
the first industrial society, [and through unending expansion of
free]{.underline}, in the sense of contestable, [risky markets, on the
coat-tails of a hegemonic carrier state and its market -opening
policies]{.underline} both domestically and internationally. 3 As a
version of industrial society, capitalist society is distinguished by
the fact that its collective productive capital is accumulated in the
hands of a minority of its members who enjoy the legal privilege, in the
form of rights of private property, to dispose of such capital in any
way they see fit, including letting it sit idle or transferring it
abroad. One implication of this is that the vast majority of the members
of a capitalist society must work under the direction, however mediated,
of the private owners of the tools they need to provide for themselves,
and on terms set by those owners in line with their desire to maximize
the rate of increase of their capital. Motivating non-owners to do so-
to work hard and diligently in the interest of the owners - requires
artful devices - sticks and carrots of the most diverse sorts that are
never certain to function - that have to be continuously reinvented as
capitalist progress continuously renders them obsolescent. [The tensions
and contradictions within the capitalist political-economic
configuration make for an ever-present possibility of structural
breakdown and social crisis]{.underline}. Economic and social stability
under modern capitalism must be secured on a background of systemic
restlessness4 produced by competition and expansion, a difficult
balancing act with a constantly uncertain outcome. Its success is
contingent on, among other things, the timely appearance of a new
technological paradigm or the development of social needs and values
complementing changing requirements of continued economic growth. For
example, for the vast majority of its members, a capitalist society must
manage to convert their ever-present fear of being cut out of the
productive process, because of economic or technological restructuring,
into acceptance of the highly unequal distribution of wealth and power
generated by the capitalist economy and a belief in the legitimacy of
capitalism as a social order. For this, highly complicated and
inevitably fragile institutional and ideological provisions arc
necessary. The same holds true for the conversion of insecure workers -
kept insecure to make them obedient workers - into confident consumers
happily discharging their consumerist social obligations even in the
face of the fundamental uncertainty oflabour markets and employment.\'
In light of the inherent instability of modern societies founded upon
and dynamically shaped by a capitalist economy, it is small wonder that
theories of capitalism, from the time the concept was first used in the
early 1800s in Germany\" and the mid-1800s in England/ were always also
theories of crisis. This holds not just for Marx and Engels but also for
writers like Ricardo, Mill, Sombart, Keynes, Hilferding, Polanyi and
Schumpeter, all of whom expected one way or other to see the end of
capitalism during their lifetime.\" What kind of crisis was expected to
finish capitalism off differed with time and authors\' theoretical
priors; structuralist theories of death by overproduction or
underconsumption, or by a tendency of the rate of profit to fall (Marx),
coexisted with predictions of saturation of needs and markets (Keynes),
of rising resistance to further commodification oflife and society
(Polanyi), of exhaustion of new land and new labour available for
colonization in a literal as well as figurative sense (Luxemburg), of
technological stagnation (Kondratieff), financial-political organization
of monopolistic corporations suspending liberal markets (Hilferding),
bureaucratic suppression of entrepreneurialism aided by a worldwide
trahison des clercs (Weber, Schumpeter, Hayek) etc., etc.\" While none
of these theories came true as imagined, most of them were not entirely
false either. In fact, [the history of modern capitalism can be written
as a succession of crises that capitalism survived only at the price of
deep transformations of its economic and social institutions, saving it
from bankruptcy in unforeseeable and often unintended ways]{.underline}.
Seen this way, [that the capitalist order still exists may well appear
less impressive than that it existed so often on the brink of collapse
and had continuously to change, frequently depending on contingent
exogenous supports that it was unable to mobilize endogenously. [The
fact **that capitalism has**]{.mark}, until now, **[managed to outlive
all predictions of its impending death, need not mean that it will
forever be able to do so]{.mark}**; there is no inductive proof
here]{.underline}, and [we cannot rule out the possibility that, **next
time**, whatever cavalry capitalism may require for its rescue may fail
to show up]{.underline}. A short recapitulation of the history of modern
capitalism serves to illustrate this point. 10 Liberal capitalism in the
nineteenth century was confronted by a revolutionary labour movement
that needed to be politically tamed by a complex combination of
repression and co-optation, including democratic power sharing and
social reform. In the early twentieth century, capitalism was
commandeered to serve national interests in international wars, thereby
converting it into a public utility under the planning regimes of a new
war economy, as private property and the invisible hand of the market
seemed insufficient for the provision of the collective capacities
countries needed to prevail in international hostilities. After the
First World War, restoration of a liberal-capitalist economy failed to
produce a viable social order and had to give way in large parts of the
industrial world to either Communism or Fascism, while in the core
countries of what was to become \'the West\' liberal capitalism was
gradually succeeded, in the aftermath of the Great Depression, by
Keynesian, state-administered capitalism. Out of this grew the
democratic welfare-state capitalism of the three post-war decades, with
hindsight the only period in which economic growth and social and
political stability, achieved through democracy, coexisted under
capitalism, at least in the OECD world where capitalism came to be
awarded the epithet, \'advanced\'. In the 1970s, however, what had with
hindsight been called the \'post-war settlement\' of social-democratic
capitalism began to disintegrate, gradually and imperceptibly at first
but increasingly punctuated by successive, ever more severe crises of
both the capitalist economy and the social and political institutions
embedding, that is, supporting as well as containing it. This was the
period of both intensifying crisis and deep transformation when \'late
capitalism\', as impressively described by Werner Sombart in the 1920s,
11 gave way to neoliberalism. Crisis Theory Redux [Today, after the
watershed of the financial crisis of 2008]{.underline}, critical and
indeed crisis-theoretical reflection on the prospects of capitalism and
its society is again en vogue. Does Capitalism Have a Future? is the
title of a book published in 2013 by five outstanding social scientists:
Immanuel Wallerstein, Randall Collins, Michael Mann, Georgi Derluguian
and Craig Calhoun. Apart from the introduction and the conclusion, which
are collectively authored, the contributors present their views in
separate chapters, and this could not be otherwise since they differ
widely. Still, all five share the conviction that, as they state in the
introduction, [\'something big looms on the horizon: [a structural
crisis much bigger than the]{.mark} recent [Great
Recession]{.mark}]{.underline}, which might in retrospect seem only a
prologue to a period of deeper troubles and transformations: 12 On what
is causing this crisis, however, and how it will end, there is
substantial disagreement- which, with authors of this calibre, may be
taken as a sign of the multiple uncertainties and possibilities inherent
in the present condition of the capitalist political economy. To give an
impression of how leading theorists may differ when trying to imagine
the future of capitalism today, I will at some length review the
prospects and predictions put forward in the book. A comparatively
conventional crisis theory is probably the one offered by
[[Wallerstein]{.underline}]{.mark} (pp. 9-35), who [[locates
c]{.mark}ontemporary [capitalism at the bottom of a Kondratieff
cycle]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Kondratieff B) [[with no]{.mark}
prospect of a new]{.underline} (Kondratieff A)
[[upturn]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is said to be [due to a \'structural
crisis\' that began in the 1970s]{.underline}, as a result of which
\'capitalists may no longer find capitalism rewarding\'. Two broad
causes are given, one a set of long-term trends \'ending the endless
accumulation of capital\', the other the demise, after the \'world
revolution of 1968\', of the \'dominance of centrist liberals of the
geoculture\' (p. 21 ). Structural trends include [the exhaustion of
virgin lands]{.underline} and the resulting necessity of environmental
repair work, [growing [resource shortages, and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
increasing need for public infrastructure. All of this costs money, and
so does the [[pacification of]{.underline}]{.mark} a proliferating mass
of [discontented [workers]{.mark}]{.underline} and the unemployed.
Concerning global hegemony, Wallerstein points to what he considers
[[the]{.mark} final [decline of the U.S.-centred world order]{.mark}, in
military and economic]{.underline} as well as ideological
[terms]{.underline}. Rising costs of doing business [[combine with
global disorder to make restoration of]{.mark} a stable [capitalist
world]{.mark} system [impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Instead
Wallerstein foresees \'an ever-tighter gridlock of the system. [Gridlock
will]{.underline} in turn [result in ever-wilder fluctuations, and will
consequently make short-term predictions - both economic and political -
ever more unreliable]{.underline}. And this in turn will aggravate \...
popular fears and alienation. It is a negative cycle\' (p. 32). For the
near future Wallerstein expects a global political confrontation between
defenders and opponents of the capitalist order, in his suggestive
terms: between the forces of Davos and of Porto Alegre. Their final
battle \'about the successor system\' (p. 35) is currently fomenting.
Its outcome, according to Wallerstein, is unpredictable, although \'we
can feel sure that one side or the other will win out in the coming
decades, and a new reasonably stable world-system (or set of
world-systems) will be established: Much less pessimistic, or less
optimistic from the perspective of those who would like to see
capitalism dose down, is Craig Calhoun, who finds prospects of reform
and renewal in what he, too, considers a deep and potentially final
crisis (pp. 131-61). Calhoun assumes that there is still time for
political intervention to save capitalism, as there was in the past,
perhaps with the help of a \'sufficiently enlightened faction of
capitalists\' (p. 2). But he also believes \'a centralized socialist
economy\' to be possible, and even more so \'Chinese-style state
capitalism\': \'Markets can exist in the future even while specifically
capitalist modes of property and finance have declined\' (p. 3). Far
more than Wallerstein, Calhoun is reluctant when it comes to prediction
(for a summary of his view see pp. 158-61 ). His chapter offers a list
of internal contradictions and possible external disruptions threatening
the stability of capitalism, and points out a wide range of alternative
outcomes. Like Wallerstein, Calhoun attributes particular significance
to the international system, where he anticipates the emergence of a
plurality of more or less capitalist political-economic regimes, with
the attendant problems and pitfalls of coordination and competition.
While he does not rule out a \'large-scale, more or less simultaneous
collapse of capitalist markets \... not only bringing economic upheaval
but also upending political and social institutions\' (p. 161), Calhoun
believes in the possibility of states, corporations and social movements
re-establishing effective governance for a transformative renewal of
capitalism. To quote, The capitalist order is a very large-scale, highly
complex system. The events of the last forty years have deeply disrupted
the institutions that kept capitalism relatively well organized through
the postwar period. Efforts to repair or replace these will change the
system, just as new technologies and new business and financial
practices may. Even a successful renewal of capitalism will transform it
\... The question is whether change will be adequate to manage systemic
risks and fend off external threats. And if not, will there be
widespread devastation before a new order emerges? (p. 161) Even more
agnostic on the future of capitalism is Michael Mann (\'The End May Be
Nigh, But for Whom?: pp. 71-97). Mann begins by reminding his readers
that in his \'general model of human society\', he does \'not conceive
of societies as systems but as multiple, overlapping networks of
interaction, of which four networks - ideological, economic, military
and political power relations - are the most important. Geopolitical
relations can be added to the four .. : Mann continues: Each of these
four or five sources of power may have an internal logic or tendency of
development, so that it might be possible, for example, to identify
tendencies toward equilibrium, cycles, or contradictions within
capitalism, just as one might identify comparable tendencies within the
other sources of social power. (p. 72) Interactions between the
networks, Mann points out, are frequent but not systematic, meaning that
\'once we admit the importance of such interactions we are into a more
complex and uncertain world in which the development of capitalism, for
example, is also influenced by ideologies, wars and states\' (p. 73).
Mann adds to this the possibility of uneven development across
geographical space and the likelihood of irrational behaviour
interfering with rational calculations of interest, even of the interest
in survival. To demonstrate the importance of contingent events and of
cycles other than those envisaged in the Wallerstein-Kondratieff model
of history, Mann discusses the Great Depression of the 1930s and the
Great Recession of 2008. He then proceeds to demonstrate how his
approach speaks to the future, first of U.S. hegemony and second of
\'capitalist markets\'. As to the former, Mann (pp. 83-4) offers the
standard list of American weaknesses, both domestic and international,
from economic decline to political anomy to an increasingly less
effective military- weaknesses that \'might bring America down\'
although \'we cannot know for sure: Even if U.S. hegemony were to end,
however, \'this need not cause a systemic crisis of capitalism\'. What
may instead happen is a shift of economic power \'from the old West to
the successfully developing Rest of the world, including most of Asia.
This would result in a sharing of economic power between the United
States, the European Union and (some of) the BRICS, as a consequence of
which \'the capitalism of the medium term is likely to be more statist\'
(p. 86). Concerning \'capitalist markets\' (pp. 86-7), Mann believes,
pace Wallerstein, that there is still enough new land to conquer and
enough demand to discover and invent, to allow for both extensive and
intensive growth. Also, technological fixes may appear any time for all
sorts of problems, and in any case it is the working class and
revolutionary socialism, much more than capitalism, for which \'the end
is nigh: In fact, if growth rates were to fall as predicted by some, the
outcome might be a stable low-growth capitalism, with considerable
ecological benefits. In this scenario, \'the future of the left is
likely to be at most reformist social democracy or liberalism. Employers
and workers will continue to struggle over the mundane injustices of
capitalist employment \[ \... \] and their likely outcome will be
compromise and reform .. .\' Still, Mann ends on a considerably less
sanguine note, naming two big crises that he considers possible, and one
of them probable - crises in which capitalism would go under although
they would not be crises of capitalism, or of capitalism alone, since
[[capitalism would only perish as a result of **the destruction
of**]{.mark} **all human [civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
One such scenario would be [**[nuclear war]{.mark}**, started by
collective human irrationality]{.underline}, the other an [ecological
catastrophe resulting from \'escalating **[climate
change\']{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the latter case (pp. 93ff.),
capitalism figures - together with the nation state and with \'citizen
rights\', defined as entitlements to unlimited consumption - as one of
three \'triumphs of the modern period\' that happen to be ecologically
unsustainable. \'All three triumphs would have to be challenged for the
sake of a rather abstract future, which is a very tall order, perhaps
not achievable\' (p. 95). While related to capitalism, ecological
disaster would spring from \'a causal chain bigger than capitalism\' (p.
97). However, \'policy decisions matter considerably\', and \'humanity
is in principle free to choose between better or worse future scenarios-
and so ultimately the future is unpredictable\' (p. 97). The most
straightforward theory of capitalist crisis in the book is offered by
Randall Collins (pp. 37-69) - a theory he correctly characterizes as a
\'stripped-down version of (a\] fundamental insight that Marx and Engels
had formulated already in the 1840s\' (p. 38). That insight, as adapted
by Collins, is that [capitalism is subject to \'a long-term structural
weakness: namely \'the technological displacement of labor by
machinery\']{.underline} (p. 37). Collins is entirely unapologetic for
his strictly structuralist approach, even more structuralist than
Wallerstein\'s, as well as his mono-factorial technological determinism.
In fact, he is convinced that [[\'technological displacement of labor\'
will]{.mark} have [finishe]{.mark}d [capitalism]{.mark}, with or without
revolutionary violence, **[by the middle of this century]{.mark}** -
earlier]{.underline} than it would be brought down by the, in principle,
[equally destructive and definitive ecological crisis, and more reliably
than]{.underline} by comparatively difficult-to-predict [financial
bubbles]{.underline}. \'Stripped-down\' Collins\'s late-Marxist
structuralism is, among other things, because unlike Marx in his
corresponding theorem of a secular decline of the rate of profit,
Collins fails to hedge his prediction with a list of countervailing
factors,\' 3 as he believes capitalism to have run out of whatever
saving graces may in the past have retarded its demise. Collins does
allow for Mann\'s and Calhoun\'s non-Marxist, \'Weberian\' influences on
the course of history, but only as secondary forces modifying the way
the fundamental structural trend that drives the history of capitalism
from below will work itself out. [Global unevenness of
development]{.underline}, dimensions of conflict that are not
capitalism-related, [[war and ecological pressures
may]{.underline}]{.mark} or may not [[accelerate the crisis]{.mark} of
the capitalist labour market and employment system]{.underline}; they
cannot, however, suspend or avert it. What exactly does this crisis
consist of? While labour has gradually been replaced by technology for
the past two hundred years, [with the rise of information technology
and]{.underline}, in the very near future, [artificial intelligence,
that process]{.underline} is currently reaching its apogee, in at least
two respects: first, it [has]{.underline} vastly [accelerated,
and]{.underline} second, having in the second half of the twentieth
century destroyed the manual working class, it [is now]{.underline}
attacking and [about to destroy the middle class]{.underline} as well -
in other words, the new petty bourgeoisie [that is the very carrier of
the neocapitalist and neoliberal lifestyle]{.underline} of \'hard work
and hard play\', of careerism-cum-consumerism, which, as will be
discussed infra, may indeed be considered the indispensable cultural
foundation of contemporary capitalism\'s society. What Collins sees
coming is a rapid educational work by machinery intelligent enough even
to design and create new, more advanced machinery. Electronicization
will do to the middle class what mechanization has done to the working
class, and it will do it much faster. [The result will be **unemployment
in the order of 50 to 70 per cent** by the middle of the century,
hitting those who had hoped, by way of expensive education and
disciplined job performance (in return for stagnant or declining wages),
to escape the]{.underline} threat of redundancy attendant on the
[working classes. The benefits, meanwhile, will go to \'a tiny
capitalist class of robot owners\']{.underline} who will become
immeasurably rich. The drawback for them is, however, that they will
increasingly find that their product \'cannot be sold because too few
persons have enough income to buy it. Extrapolating this underlying
tendency\', Collins writes, \'Marx and Engels predicted the downfall of
capitalism and its replacement with socialism\' (p. 39), and this is
what Collins also predicts. Collins\'s theory is most original where he
undertakes to explain why technological displacement is only now about
to finish capitalism when it had not succeeded in doing so in the past.
Following in Marx\'s footsteps, he lists [five \'escapes\']{.underline}
that [have hitherto saved capitalism from self-destruction,
and]{.underline} then proceeds to show why [they won\'t save it any
more. They include]{.underline} the growth of [[new]{.underline}
j]{.mark}obs and entire [s[ectors]{.mark} compensating for employment
losses]{.underline} caused by technological progress ([employment in
artificial intelligence will be miniscule]{.underline}, especially once
robots begin to design and build other robots); [[the expansion of
markets]{.underline}]{.mark} ([which this time will primarily be labour
markets]{.underline} in middle-class occupations, globally unified by
information technology, enabling global competition among educated job
seekers); [[the growth of finance]{.underline}]{.mark}, both as a source
of income (\'speculation\') and as an industry ([which cannot possibly
balance]{.underline} the loss of employment caused by new technology,
and of income caused by [unemployment]{.underline}, also because
computerization will make workers in large segments of the financial
industry redundant); [[government employment]{.underline}]{.mark}
replacing employment in the private sector ([improbable because of the
fiscal crisis of the state]{.underline}, and in any case requiring
ultimately \'a revolutionary overturn of the property system\' \[p.
51\]); [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of [[education]{.underline}
a]{.mark}s a buffer to keep labour out of employment, making it a form
of \'hidden Keynesian ism\' while resulting in \'credential inflation\'
and \'grade inflation\' (which for Collins is the path most probably
taken, although ultimately it will prove equally futile as the others,
as a result of [demoralization within]{.underline} educational
[institutions]{.underline} and problems of financing, both public and
private). [**[All five escapes closed]{.mark}**, there is no way society
can prevent capitalism from causing accelerated displacement of labour
and]{.underline} the attendant [stark economic and social
inequalities]{.underline}. Some sort of
**[[socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, so Collins concludes,
**[[will]{.mark} finally [have to take capitalism\'s
place]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What precisely it will look like, and what
will come after socialism or with it, Collins leaves open, and he is
equally agnostic on the exact mode of the transition. Revolutionary the
change will be - but **[whether it will be a violent social
revolution]{.underline}** that will end capitalism [or a **peaceful
institutional revolution accomplished under political leadership**
cannot be known]{.underline} beforehand. Heavy taxation of the
super-rich for extended public employment or a guaranteed basic income
for everyone, with equal distribution and strict rationing of very
limited working hours by more or less dictatorial means a la Keynes\'
4 - we are free to speculate on this as Collins\'s \'stripped-down
Marxism\' does not generate predictions as to what kind of society will
emerge once capitalism will have run its course. **[Only one thing is
certain: that capitalism will end, and much sooner than one may have
thought]{.underline}**. Something of an outlier in the book\'s suite of
chapters is the contribution by Georgi Derluguian, who gives a
fascinating inside account of the decline and eventual demise of
Communism, in particular Soviet Communism (pp. 99-129). The chapter is
of interest because of its speculations on the differences from and the
potential parallels with a potential end of capitalism. As to the
differences, Derluguian makes much of the fact that [Soviet Communism
was from early on embedded in the \'hostile geopolitics\']{.underline}
(p. 110) [of a \'capitalist world-system\']{.underline} ( 111). This
linked its fate inseparably to that of the Soviet Union as an
economically and strategically overextended multinational state. That
state turned out to be unsustainable in the longer term, especially
after the end of Stalinist despotism. By then the peculiar class
structure of Soviet Communism gave rise to a domestic social compromise
that, much unlike American capitalism, included political inertia and
economic stagnation. The result was pervasive discontent on the part of
a new generation of cultural, technocratic and scientific elites
socialized in the revolutionary era of the late 1960s. Also,
[over-centralization made the state-based political economy of Soviet
Communism vulnerable to regional and ethnic separatism, while the global
capitalism surrounding it provided resentful opponents]{.underline} as
well as opportunistic apparatchiks with a template of a preferable
order, one in which the latter could ultimately establish themselves as
self-made capitalist oligarchs. Contemporary capitalism, of course, is
much less dependent on the geopolitical good fortunes of a single
imperial state, although [the role of the United States]{.underline} in
this respect [must not be underestimated]{.underline}. More importantly,
capitalism is not exposed to pressure from an alternative
political-economic model, assuming that Islamic economic doctrine will
for a foreseeable future remain less than attractive even and precisely
to Islamic elites (who are deeply integrated in the capitalist global
economy). Where the two systems may, however, come to resemble each
other is in their internal political disorder engendered by
institutional and economic decline. When the Soviet Union lost its
\'state integrity\', Derluguian writes, this \'undermined all modern
institutions and therefore disabled collective action at practically any
level above family and crony networks. This condition became
self-perpetuating\' (p. 122). One consequence was that the ruling
bureaucracies reacted \'with more panic than outright violence\' when
confronted by \'mass civic mobilizations like the 1968 Prague Spring and
the Soviet perestroika at its height in 1989\', while at the same time
\'the insurgent movements \... failed to exploit the momentous
disorganization in the ranks of dominant classes\' (p. 129). For
different reasons and under different circumstances, a similar weakness
of collective agency, due to de-institutionalization and creating
comparable uncertainty among both champions and challengers of the old
order, might shape a future transition from capitalism to
post-capitalism, pitting against each other fragmented social movements
on the one hand and disoriented political-economic elites on the other.
My own view builds on all five contributors but differs from each of
them. I take the diversity of theories on what all agree is a severe
crisis of capitalism and capitalist society as an indication of
[contemporary capitalism]{.underline} having [entered a period of deep
indeterminacy]{.underline} - a period [in which unexpected things can
happen any time and]{.underline} knowledgeable observers can
legitimately disagree on what will happen, due to [long-valid causal
relations]{.underline} having [become historically
obsolete]{.underline}. In other words, I interpret the coexistence of a
shared sense of crisis with diverging concepts of the nature of that
crisis as an indication that [**[traditional economic]{.mark}** and
sociological **[theories have today lost]{.mark} much of their
[predictive power]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As I will point out
in more detail, below, I see this as a result, but also as a cause, of a
destruction of collective agency in the course of capitalist
development, equally affecting Wallerstein\'s Davos and Porto Alegre
people and resulting in a social context beset with unintended and
unanticipated consequences of purposive, but in its effects increasingly
unpredictable, social action. \'5 Moreover, rather than picking one of
the [various scenarios of]{.underline} the [crisis]{.underline} and
privilege it over the others, I suggest that they all, or most of them,
[may be aggregated into a diagnosis of **multi-morbidity** in which
[**different disorders coexist and**,]{.mark} more often than not,
[**reinforce each other**.]{.mark} Capitalism]{.underline}, as pointed
out at the beginning, [was always]{.underline} a [fragile]{.underline}
and improbable order and for its survival depended on ongoing repair
work. [Today, however, **too many [frailties have become simultaneously
acute]{.mark}** [while]{.mark} **too many [remedies have been
exhausted]{.mark}** or destroyed. **The end of capitalism** can then be
imagined as a **death from a thousand cuts**, or from a multiplicity of
infirmities each of which will be all the more untreatable as all will
demand treatment at the same time]{.underline}. As will become apparent,
**[I do not believe that any of the potentially stabilizing
forces]{.underline}** mentioned by Mann [and]{.underline} Calhoun, [be
it regime pluralism]{.underline}, regional diversity and [uneven
development, political reform, or independent crisis cycles, **will be
strong enough to neutralize** the syndrome of **accumulated weaknesses**
that characterize contemporary capitalism. No effective opposition being
left, and no practicable successor model waiting]{.underline} in the
wings of history, [[capitalism\'s accumulation of defects]{.mark},
alongside its accumulation of capital, [may be
seen]{.mark}]{.underline}, with Collins, \'6 [[as an]{.mark} **entirely
[endogenous dynamic of self-destruction]{.mark}**, following an
evolutionary logic moulded in its expression but not suspended by
contingent and coincidental events, along a historical
trajectory]{.underline} from early liberal via state-administered to
neoliberal capitalism, [which culminated]{.underline} for the time
[being in the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath]{.underline}.
For the decline of capitalism to continue, that is to say, no
revolutionary alternative is required, and certainly no masterplan of a
better society displacing capitalism. [Contemporary capitalism is
vanishing on its own, **collapsing from internal
contradictions**]{.underline}, and not least as a result of having
vanquished its enemies - who, as noted, have often rescued capitalism
from itself by forcing it to assume a new form. [[What comes after
capitalism]{.mark} in its final crisis]{.underline}, now under way,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}, I suggest, [not socialism]{.underline} or
some other defined social order, [but a lasting interregnum - no new
world system equilibrium]{.underline} ala Wallerstein, [but a prolonged
period of social [entropy,]{.mark} or disorder]{.underline} (and
precisely for this reason a period of uncertainty and indeterminacy). It
is an interesting problem for sociological theory whether and how a
society can turn for a significant length of time into less than a
society, a post-social society as it were, or a society lite, until it
may or may not recover and again become a society in the full meaning of
the term. \' 7 I suggest that one can attain a conceptual fix on this by
drawing liberally on a famous article by David Lockwood\'\' to
distinguish between system integration and social integration, or
integration at the macro and micro levels of society. An interregnum
would then be [defined as [a breakdown of system integration]{.mark} at
the macro level, depriving individuals]{.underline} at the micro level
[of institutional structuring and collective support]{.underline}, and
shifting the burden of ordering social life, of providing it with a
modicum of security and stability, to individuals themselves and such
social arrangements as they can create on their own. [A society in
interregnum]{.underline}, in other words, would be a
de-institutionalized or under-institutionalized society, one in which
expectations can be stabilized only for a short time by local
improvisation, and which for this very reason [is essentially
ungovernable]{.underline}. Contemporary capitalism, then, would appear
to be a society whose system integration is critically and irremediably
weakened, so that the continuation of capital accumulation - for an
intermediate period of uncertain duration - becomes solely dependent on
the opportunism of collectively incapacitated individualized
individuals, as they struggle to protect themselves from looming
accidents and structural pressures on their social and economic status.
Undergoverned and undermanaged, the social world of [the post-capitalist
interregnum, in the wake of neoliberal capitalism]{.underline} having
cleared away states, governments, borders, trade unions and other
moderating forces, [can at any time be hit by disaster]{.underline}; for
example, [**bubbles imploding** or **violence penetrating from a
collapsing periphery into the centre**]{.underline}. With individuals
deprived of collective defences and left to their own devices, what
remains of a social order hinges on the motivation of individuals to
cooperate with other individuals on an ad hoc basis, [driven by fear and
greed]{.underline} and by elementary interests in individual survival.
Society having lost the ability to provide its members with effective
protection and proven templates for social action and social existence,
individuals have only themselves to rely on while social order depends
on the weakest possible mode of social integration, Zweckrationalitiit.
As pointed out in Chapter 1 of this book, and partly elaborated in the
rest of this introduction, [I anchor this condition in a variety of
interrelated developments, such as **declining growth** intensifying
**distributional conflict**]{.underline}; the [rising
**inequality**]{.underline} that results from this; **[vanishing
macroeconomic manageability]{.underline}**, as [manifested
in]{.underline}, among other things, steadily [growing indebtedness, a
pumped-up money supply; and the ever-present possibility of another
**economic breakdown**]{.underline};\'9 [the]{.underline} suspension of
post-war capitalism\'s engine of social progress, democracy, and the
associated [rise of **oligarchic rule**]{.underline}; the [**dwindling
capacity of governments** and the systemic inability of
governance]{.underline} to limit the commodification of labour, nature
and money; [the omnipresence of **corruption**]{.underline} of all
sorts, [in response to intensified]{.underline} competition in
winner-take-all [markets]{.underline} with unlimited opportunities for
self-enrichment; [the erosion of public infrastructures]{.underline} and
collective benefits in the course of commodification and privatization;
[the **failure**]{.underline} after 1989 [of]{.underline} capitalism\'s
host nation, [the United States, to build and maintain a **stable global
order**]{.underline}; etc., etc. [These and other
developments]{.underline}, I suggest, [have resulted in widespread
cynicism governing economic life]{.underline}, for a long time if not
**[forever ruling out a recovery of normative legitimacy for
capitalism]{.underline}** as a just society offering equal opportunities
for individual progress- a legitimacy that capitalism would need to draw
on in critical moments - [and founding social integration on collective
resignation]{.underline} as the last remaining pillar of the capitalist
social order, or disorder. 20

[Does the economy move in predictable waves]{.underline}, cycles or
patterns? [There are many economists that believe that it does, and
[if]{.mark} their [projections are correct]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the
rest of this **decade** is going to be]{.mark} **pure [hell]{.mark}**
for the United States.]{.underline} Many mainstream economists want
nothing to do with economic cycle theorists, but it should be noted that
[[economic cycle theories have enabled]{.mark} some [analysts to
correctly predict]{.mark} the timing of recessions, stock market peaks
and stock market [crashes]{.mark} over the past couple of
decades]{.underline}. Of course none of the theories discussed below is
perfect, but it is very interesting to note that **[[all of
them]{.underline}]{.mark}** seem to [[indicate that the U.S. economy is
about to enter a]{.mark} major [downturn]{.mark}]{.underline}. So will
the period of 2015 to 2020 turn out to be pure hell for the United
States? We will just have to wait and see.¶ One of the most prominent
economic cycle theories is known as \"[the Kondratieff
wave]{.underline}\". It was developed by a Russian economist named
Nikolai Kondratiev, and as Wikipedia has noted, his economic theories
got him into so much trouble with the Russian government that he was
eventually executed because of them\...¶ The Soviet economist Nikolai
Kondratiev (also written Kondratieff) was the first to bring these
observations to international attention in his book The Major Economic
Cycles (1925) alongside other works written in the same decade. Two
Dutch economists, Jacob van Gelderen and Samuel de Wolff, had previously
argued for the existence of 50 to 60 year cycles in 1913. However, the
work of de Wolff and van Gelderen has only recently been translated from
Dutch to reach a wider audience.¶ Kondratiev\'s ideas were not supported
by the Soviet government. Subsequently he was sent to the gulag and was
executed in 1938.¶ In 1939, Joseph Schumpeter suggested naming the
cycles \"Kondratieff waves\" in his honor.¶ In recent years, there has
been a resurgence of interest in the Kondratieff wave. The following is
an excerpt from an article by Christopher Quigley that discussed how
this theory works\...¶ Kondratiev\'s analysis described how
international capitalism had gone through many such \"great
depressions\" and as such were a normal part of the international
mercantile credit system. The long term business cycles that he
identified through meticulous research are now called \"Kondratieff\"
cycles or \"K\" waves.¶ The K wave [is a 60 year cycle]{.underline} (+/-
a year or so) [with internal phases]{.underline} that are sometimes
characterized as seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter:¶ Spring
phase: a new factor of production, good economic times, rising
inflation¶ Summer: hubristic \'peak\' war followed by societal doubts
and double digit inflation¶ Autumn: the financial fix of inflation leads
to a credit boom which creates a false plateau of prosperity that ends
in a speculative bubble¶ Winter: excess capacity worked off by massive
debt repudiation, commodity deflation & economic depression. A
\'trough\' war breaks psychology of doom.¶ Increasingly economic
academia has come to realize the brilliant insight of Nikolai Kondratiev
and accordingly there have been many reports, articles, theses and books
written on the subject of this \"cyclical\" phenomenon. An influential
essay, written by Professor W. Thompson of Indiana University, has
indicated that K waves have influenced world technological development
since the 900\'s. His thesis states that \"modern\" economic development
commenced in 930AD in the Sung province of China and he propounds that
since this date there have been 18 K waves lasting on average 60 years.¶
[So what does [the Kondratieff wave theory suggest]{.mark} is coming
next for us?**¶** Well, according to work done by Professor W. Thompson
of Indiana University, [we are heading into an economic
depression]{.mark} that should last until about the year
2020\...**¶**]{.underline} Based on Professor Thompson\'s analysis long
[**[K cycles have nearly a thousand years of supporting
evidence]{.underline}**.]{.mark} If we accept the fact that most winters
in K cycles last 20 years (as outlined in the chart above) this would
indicate that we are about halfway through the Kondratieff winter that
commenced in the year 2000. Thus in all probability we will be moving
from a \"recession\" to a \"depression\" phase in the cycle about the
year 2013 and it should last until approximately 2017-2020.¶ But of
course [[the **K**]{.mark}ondratieff **[wave]{.mark}** [is far from the
only]{.mark} economic [cycle theory that indicates that we are heading
for a]{.mark}n economic [depression]{.mark}.**¶**]{.underline} The
economic cycle [[theories]{.underline}]{.mark} of [author [Harry
Dent]{.mark} also [predict that we are on the]{.mark} [verge of]{.mark}
massive [economic problems. He]{.mark} mainly [focuses]{.mark} on
[demographics]{.mark}, and the fact that [our population is]{.mark}
rapidly [getting older]{.mark} is a major issue for him]{.underline}.
The following is an excerpt from a Business Insider article that
summarizes the major points that Dent makes in his new book\...¶ Young
people cause inflation because they \"cost everything and produce
nothing.\" But young people eventually \"begin to pay off when they
enter the workforce and become productive new workers (supply) and
higher-spending consumers (demand).\"¶ Unfortunately, the U.S. reached
its demographic \"peak spending\" from 2003-2007 and is headed for the
\"demographic cliff.\" Germany, England, Switzerland are all headed
there too. Then China will be the first emerging market to fall off the
cliff, albeit in a few decades. The world is getting older.¶ The U.S.
stock market will crash. \"Our best long-term and intermediate cycles
suggest another slowdown and stock crash accelerating between very early
2014 and early 2015, and possibly lasting well into 2015 or even 2016.
The worst economic trends due to demographics will hit between 2014 and
2019. The U.S. economy is likely to suffer a minor or major crash by
early 2015 and another between late 2017 and late 2019 or early 2020 at
the latest.\"¶ \"The everyday consumer never came out of the last
recession.\" The rich are the ones feeling great and spending money, as
asset prices (not wages) are aided by monetary stimulus.¶ The U.S. and
Europe are headed in the same direction as Japan, a country still in a
\"coma economy precisely because it never let its debt bubble
deleverage,\" Dent argues. \"The only way we will not follow in Japan\'s
footsteps is if the Federal Reserve stops printing new money.\"¶ \"The
reality is stark, when dyers start to outweigh buyers, the market
changes.\" It all comes down to an aging population, Dent writes.
\"Fewer spenders, borrowers, and investors will be around to participate
in the next boom.\"¶ The U.S. has a crazy amount of debt and
\"economists and politicians have acted like we can just wave a magic
wand of endless monetary injections and bailouts and get over what they
see as a short-term crisis.\" But the problem, Dent says, is long-term
and structural --- demographics.¶ Businesses can \"dominate the years to
come\" by focusing on cash and cash flow, being \"lean and mean,\"
deferring major capital expenditures, selling nonstrategic real estate,
and firing weak employees now.¶ The big four challenges in the years
ahead will be 1) private and public debt 2) health care and retirement
entitlements 3) authoritarian governance around the globe and 4)
environmental pollution that threatens the global economy.¶ According to
Dent, \"You need to prepare for that [[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark},
which [[will occur between 2014 and 2023]{.mark},]{.underline} with the
worst likely starting in 2014 and continuing off and on into late
2019.\"¶ So just like the Kondratieff wave, Dent\'s work indicates that
we are going to experience a major economic crisis by the end of this
decade.¶ [Another economic cycle theory that people are paying more
attention to these days is the relationship between sun spot cycles and
the stock market. It turns out that [market peaks often line up]{.mark}
very closely [with peaks in sun spot activity]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
is a theory that was first popularized by an English economist named
William Stanley Jevons.¶ [[Sun spot activity appears to have peaked in
early 2014 and is projected to]{.mark} [decline]{.mark} for the rest of
the decade. If historical trends hold up, [that is a]{.mark} very
[troubling sign for the stock market.]{.mark}**¶**]{.underline} And of
course there are many, many other economic cycle theories that seem to
indicate that trouble is ahead for the United States as well. The
following is a summary of some of them from an article by GE Christenson
and Taki Tsaklanos\...¶ Charles Nenner Research (source)¶ Stocks should
peak in mid-2013 and fall until about 2020. Similarly, bonds should peak
in the summer of 2013 and fall thereafter for 20 years. He bases his
conclusions entirely on cycle research. He expects the Dow to fall to
around 5,000 by 2018 -- 2020.¶ Kress Cycles (Clif Droke) (source)¶ The
major 120 year cycle plus all minor cycles trend down into late 2014.
The stock market should decline hard into late 2014.¶ [[Elliott
Wave]{.underline}]{.mark} (Robert Prechter) (source)¶ He [[believes that
the stock market]{.mark} has peaked and [has entered a]{.mark}
generational [bear-market]{.mark}. He anticipates a crash low in the
market around 2016 -- 2017.**¶**]{.underline} [[Market Energy
Waves]{.underline}]{.mark} (source)¶ He [[sees a 36 year cycle in stock
markets that is peaking in]{.mark} mid-[2013]{.mark}]{.underline} and
will cycle down for 2013 -- 2016. "... the controlling energy wave is
scheduled to flip back to negative on July 19 of this year." Equity
markets should drop 25 -- 50%.¶ [[Armstrong
Economic]{.mark}s]{.underline} (source)¶ His economic confidence model
[[projects a **peak in confidence**]{.mark}]{.underline} in August 2013,
a bottom in September 2014, and another peak in October 2015. The
decline into January 2020 should be severe. He expects a world-wide
crash and contraction in economies from 2015 -- 2020.¶ [Cycles per

itself?¶ Well, it should be disconcerting to a lot of people that 2014
is turning out to be eerily similar to 2007. But we never learned the
lessons that we should have learned from the last major economic crisis,
and most Americans are way too apathetic to notice that we are making
many of the very same mistakes all over again.¶ And in recent months
there have been a whole host of indications that the next major economic
downturn is just around the corner. For example, just this week we
learned that manufacturing job openings have declined for four months in
a row. For many more indicators like this, please see my previous

**Parr '13** Adrian Parr, The Wrath of Capital, 2013, p. 145-147

[A quick snapshot of [the twenty-first century so far]{.mark}: an
[economic meltdown]{.mark}; a [frantic sell-off of public land to the
energy business]{.mark} as President George W Bush exited the White
House; a [prolonged, costly]{.mark}, and [unjustified war in
Iraq]{.mark}; [the Greek economy]{.mark} in ruins; an [escalation
of]{.mark} global [food prices]{.mark}; [bee colonies in global
extinction]{.mark}; [925 million hungry]{.mark}]{.underline} reported in
2010; as of 2005, [the world\'s five hundred richest individuals with a
combined income greater than that of the poorest 416 million people, the
richest 10 percent accounting for 54 percent of global income; [a planet
on the verge of boiling]{.mark} point; [melting ice caps]{.mark};
increases in [extreme weather]{.mark} conditions; and the list goes on
and on and on]{.underline}.2 [Sounds like a ticking time bomb, doesn\'t
it?]{.underline} Well it is. It is shameful to think that [[massive
die-outs]{.mark} of future generations [will put to pale comparison
the]{.mark} 6 million murdered during the [Holocaust]{.mark}; [the
millions killed in two world wars]{.mark}; [the genocides]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Darfur]{.mark}; the [1
million left homeless]{.mark} and the [316,000 killed]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} the 2010 [earthquake]{.mark} [in Haiti]{.mark}. The time has
come to wake up to the warning signs]{.underline}.3 [The real issue
climate change poses is that we do not enjoy the luxury of incremental
change anymore. **[We are in the last decade where we can do
something]{.mark}** about the situation.]{.underline} Paul Gilding, the
former head of Greenpeace International and a core faculty member of
Cambridge University\'s Programme for Sustainability, explains that
\"two degrees of warming is an inadequate goal and a plan for failure;\'
adding that \"returning to below one degree of warming . . . is the
solution to the problem:\'4 [Once we move higher than 2°C of
warming]{.underline}, which is what is projected to occur by 2050,
[positive feedback mechanisms will begin to kick in, and then we will be
at the point of no return. We]{.underline} therefore [need to start
thinking very differently right now.]{.underline} We do not see the
crisis for what it is; we only see it as an isolated symptom that we
need to make a few minor changes to deal with. This was the message that
Venezuela\'s president Hugo Chavez delivered at the COP15 United Nations
Climate Summit in Copenhagen on Decembe . r i6, 2009, when he declared:
\"Let\'s talk about the cause. We should not avoid responsibilities, we
should not avoid the depth of this problem. And I\'ll bring it up again,
the cause of this disastrous panorama is the metabolic, destructive
system of the capital and its model: capitalism:\'s [The structural
conditions in which we operate are advanced capitalism. Given this fact,
a few **[adjustments]{.mark}** here and there to that system **[are not
enough]{.mark}** to solve the problems that climate change and
environmental degradation pose]{.underline}.6 [Adaptability,
modifications, and displacement]{.underline}, as I have consistently
shown throughout this book, [constitute the very essence of capitalism.
[Capitalism adapts without doing away with the
threat]{.mark}.]{.underline} Under capitalism, one deals with threat not
by challenging it, but by buying favors from it, as in voluntary
carbon-offset schemes. In the process, [one gives up on one\'s
autonomy]{.underline} and reverts to being a child. [Voluntarily
[offsetting]{.mark} a bit of [carbon here and there, eating
vegan]{.mark}, [or recycling]{.mark} our waste, although well intended,
[are not solutions]{.mark} to the problem, [but a symptom of the free
market\'s ineffectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}. By casting a scathing
look at the neoliberal options on display, I have tried to show how all
these options are ineffective. We are not buying indulgences because we
have a choice; choices abound, and yet they all lead us down one path
and through the golden gates of capitalist heaven. For these reasons, I
have underscored everyone\'s implication in this structure-myself
included. If anything, the book has been an act of outrage- outrage at
the deceit and the double bind that the \"choices\" under capitalism
present, for there is no choice when everything is expendable. [There is
nothing substantial about the future when all you can do is survive by
facing the absence of your own future and by sharing strength, stamina,
and courage with the people around you. All the rest is false
hope.]{.underline} In many respects, writing this book has been an
anxious exercise because I am fully aware that reducing the issues of
environmental degradation and climate change to the domain of analysis
can stave off the institution of useful solutions. But in my defense I
would also like to propose that [each and every one of us has certain
skills that can contribute to making the solutions that we introduce in
response to climate change and environmental degradation more effective
and more realistic]{.underline}. In light of that view, I close with the
following proposition, which I mean in the most optimistic sense
possible: [[our politics must start from the point that after 2050 it
may all be over.]{.underline}]{.mark}

###  Laundry List -- Robinson

#### Capitalism generates a present of differentially distributed mass violence, environmental destruction and extinction.

**Robinson 14** (William I., Prof. of Sociology, Global and
International Studies, and Latin American Studies, @ UC-Santa Barbara,
"Global Capitalism: Crisis of Humanity and the Specter of 21st Century
Fascism" The World Financial Review)

Cyclical, Structural, and Systemic Crises ¶ Most commentators on the
contemporary crisis refer to the "Great Recession" of 2008 and its
aftermath. Yet [[the]{.mark} causal [origins of global crisis
are]{.mark} to be [found in over-accumulation and]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [in [contradictions of state power]{.mark}]{.underline}, or in what
Marxists call the internal contradictions of the capitalist system.
Moreover, [because the system is now global, [crisis in]{.mark} any [one
place]{.mark} tends to [represent crisis for the system]{.mark} as a
whole.]{.underline} The system cannot expand because the marginalisation
of a significant portion of humanity from direct productive
participation, the downward pressure on wages and popular consumption
worldwide, and the polarisation of income, has reduced the ability of
the world market to absorb world output. At the same time, [given the
particular configuration of social and class forces and the correlation
of these forces worldwide, national states are hard-pressed to regulate
transnational circuits of accumulation and offset]{.underline} the
[explosive contradictions]{.underline} built into the system. ¶ Is this
crisis cyclical, structural, or systemic? [Cyclical crises are recurrent
to capitalism about once every 10 years and involve recessions that act
as self-correcting mechanisms]{.underline} without any major
restructuring of the system. The recessions of the early 1980s, the
early 1990s, and of 2001 were cyclical crises. In contrast, the 2008
crisis signaled the slide into a structural crisis*. Structural crises*
reflect deeper contra- dictions that can only be resolved by a major
restructuring of the system. The structural crisis of the 1970s was
resolved through capitalist globalisation. Prior to that, the structural
crisis of the 1930s was resolved through the creation of a new model of
redistributive capitalism, and prior to that the struc- tural crisis of
the 1870s resulted in the development of corpo- rate capitalism. [A
systemic crisis involves the replacement of a system by an entirely new
system or by an outright collapse. A structural crisis opens up the
possibility for a systemic crisis.]{.underline} But if it actually
snowballs into a systemic crisis -- in this case, if it gives way either
to capitalism being superseded or to a breakdown of global civilisation
-- is not predetermined and depends entirely on the response of social
and political forces to the crisis and on historical contingencies that
are not easy to forecast. [This is an historic moment of extreme
uncertainty, in which collective responses from distinct social and
class forces to the crisis are in great flux. ¶]{.underline} Hence my
concept of global crisis is broader than financial. [There are multiple
and mutually constitutive dimensions -- economic, social, political,
cultural, ideological and ecological, not to mention the existential
crisis of our consciousness]{.underline}, values and very being. There
is a crisis of social polarisation, that is, of *social reproduction.*
[The system cannot meet the needs]{.underline} or assure the survival
[of millions of people]{.underline}, perhaps a majority of humanity.
There are crises of state legitimacy and political authority, or of
*hegemony* and *domination.* National states face spiraling crises of
legitimacy as they fail to meet the social grievances of local working
and popular classes experiencing downward mobility, unemployment,
heightened insecurity and greater hardships. [The legitimacy of the
system has increasingly been called into question by
millions]{.underline}, [perhaps]{.underline} even
[billions]{.underline}, of people around the world, [and is facing
expanded counter-hegemonic challenges.]{.underline} Global elites have
been unable counter this erosion of the system's authority in the face
of worldwide pressures for a global moral economy. [And [a canopy that
envelops all these dimensions is]{.mark} a crisis of sustainability
rooted in]{.underline} an ecological holocaust that has already begun,
expressed in [**[climate change and the impending collapse of
centralised]{.mark} [agricultural]{.mark}** systems]{.underline} in
several regions of the world, among other indicators. By [a crisis of
humanity]{.underline} I mean a crisis that is approaching systemic
proportions, [**[threatening the ability of billions of people to
survive]{.mark}**, and raising the specter of a collapse of world
civilisation]{.underline} and degeneration into a new "Dark Ages."2 ¶
This crisis of humanity shares a number of aspects with earlier
structural crises but there are also several features unique to the
present: ¶ 1. [[The system is fast reaching]{.mark} the **[ecological
limits of its reproduction]{.mark}**. Global capitalism now couples
human and natural history in such a way as to threaten to bring about
what would be the sixth mass extinction]{.underline} in the known
history of life on earth.3 This mass extinction would be caused not by a
natural catastrophe such as a meteor impact or by evolutionary changes
such as the end of an ice age but by purposive human activity. According
to leading environmental scientists [there are nine "planetary
boundaries" crucial to maintaining an earth system environment in which
humans can exist, four of which are experiencing]{.underline} at this
time [the onset of irreversible environmental degradation and three of
which]{.underline} (climate change, the nitrogen cycle, and biodiversity
loss) [are at "tipping points]{.underline}," meaning that these
processes have already crossed their planetary boundaries. ¶ 2. [The
magnitude of the means of **[violence]{.mark}** and]{.underline} social
[control **[is unprecedented]{.mark}**, as is the concentration of the
means of global communication and symbolic production]{.underline} and
circulation in the hands of a very few powerful groups. [**[Computerised
wars, drones, bunker-buster bombs]{.mark}**, star wars]{.underline}, and
so forth, [have changed the face of warfare. Warfare has become
normalised and sanitised for those not directly at the receiving end of
armed aggression.]{.underline} At the same time we have arrived at the
panoptical surveillance society and the age of thought control by those
who control global flows of communication, images and symbolic
production. The world of Edward Snowden is the world of George Orwell;
*1984 has arrived;* ¶ 3. [Capitalism is reaching apparent limits to its
extensive expansion. There are no longer any new territories of
significance that can be integrated into world capitalism,
de-ruralisation is now well advanced, and the commodification of the
countryside and of pre- and non-capitalist spaces has
intensified]{.underline}, that is, converted in hot-house fashion into
spaces of capital, so that *intensive* expansion is reaching depths
never before seen. [Capitalism must continually expand or
collapse.]{.underline} How or where will it now expand? ¶ 4. [[There
is]{.mark} the rise of [a vast surplus population]{.mark} inhabiting a
"planet of slums,"]{.underline}4 [[alienated from the productive
economy]{.mark}, thrown into the margins, and [subject to]{.mark}
sophisticated systems of social **[control and]{.mark} to
[destruction]{.mark}** - to a mortal cycle of
dispossession-exploitation-exclusion. This includes [**prison-industrial
and immigrant-detention complexes, omnipresent policing, militarised
gentrificatio**n]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so on; ¶ 5. [There is a
disjuncture between a globalising economy and a nation-state based
system of political authority.]{.underline} [Transnational state
apparatuses]{.underline} are incipient and [have not been able to play
the role of]{.underline} what social scientists refer to as a
"[hegemon]{.underline}," or a leading nation-state that has enough power
and authority to organise and stabilise the system. [[The spread of
**w**]{.mark}eapons of **[m]{.mark}**ass **[d]{.mark}**estruction
[and]{.mark} the unprecedented [militarisation]{.mark} of social life
and conflict across the globe [makes it hard to imagine]{.mark} that
[the system can come under]{.mark} any [stable political
authority]{.mark} that assures its reproduction.]{.underline} ¶ Global
Police State ¶ How have social and political forces worldwide responded
to crisis? The crisis has resulted in a rapid political polarisation in
global society. Both right and left-wing forces are ascendant. Three
responses seem to be in dispute. ¶ One is what we could call "reformism
from above." This elite reformism is aimed at stabilising the system, at
saving the system from itself and from more radical re- sponses from
below. Nonetheless, in the years following the 2008 collapse of the
global financial system it seems these reformers are unable (or
unwilling) to prevail over the power of transnational financial capital.
A second response is popular, grassroots and leftist resistance from
below. As social and political conflict escalates around the world there
appears to be a mounting global revolt. While such resistance appears
insurgent in the wake of 2008 it is spread very unevenly across
countries and regions and facing many problems and challenges. ¶ Yet
another response is that I term *21st century fascism*.5 [[The
ultra-right is]{.mark} an [insurgent]{.mark} force in many
countries.]{.underline} In broad strokes, [this project seeks to fuse
reactionary political power with transnational capital and to organise a
mass base among historically privileged sectors of the global working
class]{.underline} -- [such as white workers]{.underline} in the North
and middle layers in the South -- [that are now experiencing heightened
insecurity and the specter of downward mobility. [It involves
**militarism**]{.mark}**, extreme [masculinisation, homophobia, racism
and racist mobilisations]{.mark}**, including the search for scapegoats,
such as immigrant workers and]{.underline}, in the West, [Muslims.
**[Twenty-first century fascism]{.mark}** evokes mystifying ideologies,
often involving race/culture supremacy and xenophobia, embracing an
idealised and mythical past. Neo-fascist culture **[normalises and
glamorises warfare]{.mark}** and social violence, indeed, generates a
fascination with domination that is portrayed even as
heroic.]{.underline}

###  Laundry List -- Shaviro

#### Neoliberal capitalism will produce extinction -- the system reproduces crises that depoliticize the left, undermine futural thought, and postpone its demise -- the impacts are environmental collapse, endless war, and the rise of fascism

<https://track5.mixtape.moe/qdkkdt.pdf> cVs) []{.mark}

The problem may be summarized as follows. [Capitalism has indeed created
the conditions for general prosperity and therefore for its own
supersession. But it has also blocked, and continues to block, any hope
of realizing this transformation. [We cannot]{.mark} wait for capitalism
to transform on its own, but we also cannot [hope to progress by
appealing to some radical Outside]{.mark} or by fashioning ourselves as
militants faithful to some "event" that]{.underline} (as Badiou has it)
[would mark a radical and complete break with the given "situation" of
capitalism.]{.underline} Accelerationism rather demands a movement
against and outside capitalism---but on the basis of tendencies and
technologies that are intrinsic to capitalism. [Audre Lord famously
argued that "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's
house." But [what if the master's tools are the only ones
available?]{.mark}]{.underline} Accelerationism grapples with this
dilemma. What is the appeal of [accelerationism]{.underline} today? It
[can be understood as a response to the particular social and political
situation in which we currently seem to be trapped: that of a long-term,
slow-motion catastrophe**. [Global warming, and environmental
pollution]{.mark} and degradation, [threaten to undermine our]{.mark}
whole [mode of life.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[And this mode of life
is]{.mark} itself increasingly stressful and [precarious]{.mark}, due to
the depredations of neoliberal capitalism.]{.underline} As Fredric
Jameson puts it, [[the world today is characterized by]{.mark}
"heightened [polarization]{.mark}, increasing [unemployment, \[and\]
the]{.mark} ever more desperate [search for new]{.mark} investments and
new [markets.]{.mark}"]{.underline} These are all general features of
capitalism identified by Marx, but in neoliberal society we encounter
them in a particularly pure and virulent form. I want to be as specific
as possible in my use of the term "neoliberalism" in order to describe
this situation. I define neoliberalism as a specific mode of capitalist
production (Marx), and form of governmentality (Foucault), that is
characterized by the following specific factors: 1. The dominating
influence of financial institutions, which facilitate transfers of
wealth from everybody else to the already extremely wealthy (the "One
Percent" or even the top one hundredth of one percent). 2. The
privatization and commodification of what used to be common or public
goods (resources like water and green space, as well as public services
like education, communication, sewage and garbage disposal, and
transportation). 3. The extraction, by banks and other large
corporations, of a surplus from all social activities: not only from
production (as in the classical Marxist model of capitalism) but from
circulation and consumption as well. [[Capital accumulation
proceed]{.mark}s not only [by]{.mark} direct [exploitation]{.mark} but
also by rent-seeking, by debt collection, [and]{.mark} by outright
[expropriation]{.mark}]{.underline} ("primitive accumulation"). 4. [[The
subjection of all aspects of life to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} so-called
[discipline of the market.]{.mark} This is equivalent]{.underline}, in
more traditional Marxist terms[, to the "real subsumption" by capital of
all aspects of life: leisure as well as labor.]{.underline} Even our
sleep is now organized in accordance with the imperatives of production
and capital accumulation. 5. The redefinition of human beings as private
owners of their own "human capital." [Each person is
thereby]{.underline}, as Michel Foucault puts it, [forced to become "an
entrepreneur of himself."]{.underline} In such circumstances, we are
continually obliged to market ourselves, to "brand" ourselves, to
maximize the return on our "investment" in ourselves. There is never
enough: like the Red Queen, we always need to keep running, just to stay
in the same place. [Precarity is the fundamental condition of our lives.
All of [these processes work on a global scale]{.mark}; they extend far
beyond the level of immediate individual experience. My life is
precarious, at every moment, but I cannot apprehend the forces that make
it so. I know how little money is left from my last paycheck, but I
cannot grasp, in concrete terms, how "the economy" works. I directly
experience the daily weather, but I do not directly experience the
climate. Global warming and worldwide financial networks are examples
of]{.underline} what the ecological theorist Timothy Morton calls
[hyperobjects.]{.underline} They are phenomena that actually exist but
that "stretch our ideas of time and space, since they far outlast most
human time scales, or they're massively distributed in terrestrial space
and so are unavailable to immediate experience." Hyperobjects affect
everything that we do, but we cannot point to them in specific
instances. [The chains of causality are far too complicated and
intermeshed for us to follow.]{.underline} In order to make sense of our
condition, we are forced to deal with difficult abstractions. We have to
rely upon data that are gathered in massive quantities by scientific
instruments and then collated through mathematical and statistical
formulas but that are not directly accessible to our senses. We find
ourselves, as Mark Hansen puts it, entangled "within networks of media
technologies that operate predominantly, if not almost entirely, outside
the scope of human modes of awareness (consciousness, attention, sense
perception, etc.)." We cannot imagine such circumstances in any direct
or naturalistic way, but only through the extrapolating lens of science
fiction. [Subject to these conditions, [we live under relentless
environmental and financial assault]{.mark}.]{.underline} We continually
find ourselves in what might well be called a state of crisis. However,
this involves a paradox. [A crisis---whether economic, ecological, or
political---is a turning point, a sudden rupture, a sharp and immediate
moment of reckoning.]{.underline} But for us today, [[crisis has
become]{.mark} a [chronic]{.mark} and seemingly permanent condition. [We
live]{.mark}, oxymoronically, [in a state of perpetual]{.mark}, but
never resolved, convulsion and [contradiction. Crises]{.mark} never come
to a culmination; instead, they [are]{.mark} endlessly and indefinitely
[deferred.]{.mark}]{.underline} For instance, [[after]{.mark} the
economic collapse of [2008, the big banks were bailed out]{.mark} by the
United States government. [This allowed them to resume the]{.mark} very
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline}---the creation of arcane financial
instruments, in order to enable relentless rent-seeking---**[[that led
to the breakdown]{.mark} of the economic system [in the first
place]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The functioning of the system is
restored, but only in such a way [as to guarantee the renewal of
the]{.mark} same [crisis, on a greater scale, further down the
road.]{.mark}]{.underline} Marx rightly noted that crises are endemic to
capitalism. But far from threatening the system as Marx hoped, today
[[these crises]{.mark} actually [help it to renew]{.mark}
itself.]{.underline} As David Harvey puts it, [it is precisely
"[through]{.mark} the destruction of the achievements of preceding eras
by way of [war]{.mark}, the devaluation of assets, the degradation of
productive capacity, [abandonment and]{.mark} other forms of '[creative
destruction']{.mark}" that [capitalism creates]{.mark} "a new basis for
profit-making and [surplus absorption]{.mark}."]{.underline} What lurks
behind this analysis is the frustrating sense of an impasse. Among its
other accomplishments, [neoliberal capitalism has also robbed us of the
future. For it turns everything into an eternal present.]{.underline}
The highest values of our society---as preached in the business
schools---are novelty, innovation, and creativity. And yet these always
only result in more of the same. How often have we been told that a
minor software update "changes everything"? [Our society seems to
function]{.underline}, as Ernst Bloch once put it, [in a state of "sheer
aimless infinity and incessant changeability; where everything ought to
be constantly new, everything remains just as it was." This is because,
in our current state of affairs, [the future exists only]{.mark} in
order [to be colonized]{.mark} and made into an investment
opportunity.]{.underline} John Maynard Keynes sought to distinguish
between risk and genuine uncertainty. Risk is calculable in terms of
probability, but genuine uncertainty is not. Uncertain events are
irreducible to probabilistic analysis, because "there is no scientific
basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever." Keynes's
discussion of uncertainty has strong affinities with Quentin
Meillassoux's account of hyperchaos. For Meillassoux, there is no
"totality of cases," no closed set of all possible states of the
universe. Therefore, there is no way to assign fixed probabilities to
these states. This is not just an empirical matter of insufficient
information; uncertainty exists in principle. For Meillassoux and Keynes
alike, there comes a point where "we simply do not know." But today,
Keynes's distinction is entirely ignored. [The Black-Scholes Formula and
the Efficient Market Hypothesis both conceive the future entirely in
probabilistic terms.]{.underline} In these theories, as in the actual
financial trading that is guided by them (or at least rationalized by
them), [the genuine unknowability of the future is transformed into a
matter of calculable, manageable risk.]{.underline} True novelty is
excluded, because all possible outcomes have already been calculated and
paid for in terms of the present. While this belief in the calculability
of the future is delusional, it nonetheless determines the way that
financial markets actually work. We might therefore say that speculative
finance is the inverse---and the complement---of the "affirmative
speculation" that takes place in science fiction. Financial speculation
seeks to capture, and shut down, the very same extreme potentialities
that science fiction explores. Science fiction is the narration of open,
unaccountable futures; derivatives trading claims to have accounted for,
and discounted, all these futures already. [[The
"market]{.mark}"---]{.underline}nearly deified in neoliberal
doctrine---thus works preemptively, as a global practice of what Richard
Grusin calls premediation. It [[seeks to deplete the future in advance.
Its]{.mark} relentless [functioning makes it nearly impossible]{.mark}
for us [to conceive of any]{.mark} [alternative]{.mark} to the global
capitalist world order. Such is the condition that Mark Fisher calls
capitalist realism.]{.underline} As Fisher puts it, channeling both
Jameson and Žižek, ["it's easier to imagine the end of the world than
the end of capitalism."]{.underline}

### Poverty

#### Capitalism literally shapes the very structural livelihoods of our subjectivity - key internal link to poverty and depression

**Stevenson 82** Paul, "Capitalism and inequality: The negative
consequences for humanity",
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00728232

[[The monopoly capitalist firm restricts investments to restrict supply
to keep prices and profits up and is constantly involved in a juggling
act which in the end always will give rise to stagnation. The cor-
porate capitalist state steps in to absorb the economic surplus through
spending]{.mark}]{.underline} (but in ways which do not hurt corporate
profit-making, and in- deed facilitate such profit-making, e.g.,
military spending, freeway construc- tion, etc.), [[and to some
necessary degree, promoting welfare state measures. Nonetheless, over
the long run these policies and actions are insufficient and/or reach
the point of diminishing returns and/or create new
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as a fiscal crisis of the state and
a weakening of the economy\'s founda- tions \[89\]. Historically,
capitalist industrialized nations have boom-and- bust economies
culminating in the stagflation of the present era. The stag- nation side
is unemployment. The less well-off in our society tend to be the ones
who are first affected by increasing unemployment. Research has
indicated that unemployment leads to a greater dissatisfaction with
one\'s self or one\'s self image \[90\]. The research of people like
Harvey Brenner has indicated that increased un- employment is strongly
related to increased rates of mental illness, suicide, homicide,
divorce, heart attack deaths, stroke deaths, cirrhosis of the liver
deaths, aggression, and so on \[91\]. In the 1970s a 1½ percent increase
in unemployment led to 51,570 more deaths in the United States \[92\].
[[Socioeconomic inequalities have long been associated with life span
differentials and mortality rates.]{.mark}]{.underline} Aaron Antonovsky
did an extensive review of this literature examining the general
hypothesis that, although everyone dies sometime, the time at which a
person dies is related to his or her station in life. [[Those of higher
socioeconomic status tend to live longer and exhibit lower mortality
rates than those from a lower socioeconomic position. The lowest class
in particular has substantially higher mortality rates and a shorter
life span. \"Moreover, the differential between it and other classes
evidently has not diminished over recent decades]{.mark}\"]{.underline}
\[95\]. A more recent thorough examination of the relation of
socioeconomic status to life-taking illnesses has been published by
Kitagawa and Hauser \[96\]. In general, their findings are consistent
with the findings and arguments already looked at previously and with
other findings and arguments to be presented later on in this paper. In
short[, socioeconomic status is related to mortality with those from
higher status being better off.]{.underline} HEALTH AND HAPPINESS A
National Health Survey in the United in the early 1960s indicated
\"higher rates of certain chronic disabilities among the lowest-income
groups, including heart conditions, hypertension, arthritis and
rheumatism, and visual and hearing impairments\" \[97\]. A similar study
conducted in 1976 showed that the findings earlier reported were still
applicable and that social class was related to ulcers as well, i.e.,
the lower one\'s class the higher likelihood of having an ulcer. The
1976 study als0 showed that hospitalization rates were 24 percent higher
for low income groups than for high income groups. [[The lower income
group had greater restrictions on their activity, were bed-disabled
longer, and lost twice as much time from work than did the high income
group]{.underline}]{.mark} \[98\]. Over 100,000 people in the United
States (and probably 10,000 people in Canada) die from accidents and
diseases emanating from the situation in their place of employment
\[100\]. (It seems cheaper for businesses to pay the compensation than
it is to make the work environment safe \[101\]. Evidence from England
shows that lower-status blue-collar occupations have more dangerous
working conditions and higher accident-rates than higher- status
white-collar occupations \[102\]. The same would seem to be true of the
United States and Canada. dissatisfaction has been shown to be one of
the best predictors of longevity or life-span \[104[\]. In short,
various forms of inequality seem to be directly related to people\'s
physical health.]{.underline} An earlier study by Inkeles found that,
the better off one is economically, the more likely one is to exhibit
\"happy\" behavior. [While this type of study is very subjective it does
lead us into a discussion of stressful experiences which may, in turn,
be related to many physical and mental ailments.]{.underline} Natural
scientists Joseph Eyer and Peter Sterling note that since the 1950s
there has been a dramatic increase in mortality rates for adults of
certain age groups; \"at ages 20-24, death rates have risen 21% for
white males and 26% for blacks, 1961-68, and 7% and 30%, respectively at
ages 35-39\" \[105\]. These increases were independent of American
Vietnam war deaths. They are attributable to the organization of
American industrial capitalist society, say Eyer and Sterling - a system
which is increasingly stressful to the individual. Eyer and Sterling
cite some evidence which relates stress to physical dis- eases such as
coronary heart disease, hypertension, ulcers, diabetes, pneumonia,
influenza, various cancers, cirrhosis of the liver, and so on. Surveys
show that people rank the following as stressful events for them-
selves: family break-up, death of relatives, job insecurity and job
changes, and migration. \"[[All of these stresses that people feel to be
major are associated with increased mortality\"]{.mark} \[106\]. For
instance, surviving spouses have a ten-fold excess of deaths over
similarly aged and situated people who have not been widowed. These life
stresses seem to be related to income levels. Eyer and Sterling present
data (at times rather loosely) which \"shows that unemployment, job
turnover, migration, divorce and separation are all highest for the
poor]{.underline}\" \[107\]. (It is useful to remember at this point
that there is evidence generated from the research of Goode, Hillman and
Waller, and Hill which shows a relation between socioeconomic standing
and rates of divorce and marital discord with the lower levels having
the higher rates \[108\] .) [[In short, the life experiences of the
lower socioeconomic classes seem to be more stressful and would seem to
be related to physical ailments and, thus, to higher mortality and
morbidity rates for lower class people]{.underline}]{.mark}. Eyer and
Sterling go on to argue that industrialization has increased the number
of weeks people have had to work for subsistence each year and, as well,
it has increased the intensity of that work \[109\]. The worker is
shaped to fit into an increasingly fast paced and fragmented work
setting which upsets or destroys previous community ties and rewarding
life experiences. We have become competitive, striving, alienated people
isolated from one another and without meaningful work. This is an
increasingly stressful situation which is related to physical and
psychological problems. (Eyer and Sterling cite evidence for the United
States, for instance, which 358 shows urban-rural death rates still
decidedly favoring rural residents even though medical services are more
readily available in urban areas. \"Al- though the overall death rates
have fallen since 1900, the urban-rural differential is about the same
proportionally now as it was then\" \[110\]. Un- employment from a
boom-bust type of economy exacerbates stressful situations, i.e., stress
increases because of unemployment, and/or unemployment is related to
migration (searching for work), family breakup, and slowing down the
rate of family formation which, in turn, are stress generating
experiences.

### War

#### Capitalism makes great power war inevitable- states have to expand to get access to markets, and uneven development means power is constantly shifting

**Callinicos 14** Alex, "The multiple crises of imperialism,
International Socialism",
http://isj.org.uk/the-multiple-crises-of-imperialism/

[[If the United States remains the command centre of global capitalism,
a multiplicity of crises has been flashing up]{.underline}]{.mark} on
its screens in the past few months. [Let's consider them in ascending
order of importance from the perspective of US decision
makers.]{.underline} First, there was Israel's latest war on Gaza---not
a crisis for Washington, more the kind of violent outburst through which
a kind of equilibrium is re-established, but for growing numbers of
people around the world an outrage and a crime. Secondly, there was the
war---now halted by an uneasy ceasefire---between the pro-Western
government in Kiev and Russian-backed forces in south eastern Ukraine.
Thirdly, there is the US bombing campaign to halt the advance of the
jihadi group that calls itself the Islamic State, but which we will
continue to call ISIS, in Iraq and Syria. And, finally---not yet a
crisis, but potentially the most serious conflict---there's the
increasingly intense interstate competition in East Asia in response to
China's growing power.1 One interesting thing about this list is that
two of the items---the war in Ukraine and the rise of ISIS---wouldn't
have figured in anyone's predictions at the beginning of 2014[. [This is
a sign of the volatility of the international situation, which is a
consequence of power shifts among the leading capitalist states. But
it's also quite frightening]{.mark}. C]{.underline}hristopher Clark in
his influential recent book on the outbreak of the First World War
argues that, despite the polarisation of Europe into two rival power
blocs, in the summer of 1914 "[the danger of a conflict between the
great alliance blocs seemed to be receding, just as the chain of events
that would ultimately drag Europe into war got underway]{.underline}".2
War can take even the greatest powers by surprise, as we can see now in
Barack Obama's reluctant redeployment of US military power in Iraq. But
for many on the left internationally this reluctance is feigned. For
them, the unifying theme in these different crises is the assertion of
American power to maintain and even expand Washington's global
domination, in the process pulverising states such as Iraq, Syria and
Ukraine. [This diagnosis often dovetails into a revival of what was
called "campism" during the Cold War---that is, political support for
states that, because they resist the US geopolitically, are seen as in
some sense progressive.]{.underline} The Ukraine war has, as Rob
Ferguson discusses elsewhere in this issue, been accompanied by an
outburst of campism, with the highly respected Russian Marxist Boris
Kagarlitsky going so far as to claim about the Russian-backed forces in
south eastern Ukraine: "What is happening in Novorossiya is a
revolutionary movement, though it's not yet a revolution in terms of
social change".3 [In the Middle East campism takes the form of support
for the alliance orchestrated by the Islamic Republican regime in Iran,
including notably the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Hizbollah,
the Shiite Islamist movement that dominates Lebanon. More generally,
many on the left look to Russia and China as counterweights to the US.
The problem with this complex of ideas is simultaneously factual,
theoretical and political. We'll return to the politics]{.underline}.
Factually: the US has often harboured expansionist designs. This was
true in broad terms after the Cold War, when successive administrations
sought, by exporting neoliberalism and expanding NATO, to create a
global order economically and politically dominated by the US.4 And,
more specifically, the administration of George W Bush in the neocons'
heyday after 9/11 sought to seize Iraq in order to entrench US
domination of the Middle East, topple hostile regimes in Syria and Iran,
and spread bourgeois democracy neoliberal style to the Arab world.5 [But
the Middle East today is shaped above all by the failure of this
vainglorious project and by the Arab revolutions and the reactionary
attempts to crush them. The Obama administration is profoundly conscious
of this. This doesn't mean that it won't inflict more evils on the
region, or collude in them (for example through its support for Israel),
but, as we will see in more detail below, its current aims are primarily
defensive. Understanding imperialism today The problem is also
theoretical. For much of the left imperialism is equated with US
domination. But this is not how it was understood by the classical
theorists of imperialism---and not because they were writing a hundred
years ago, long before the onset of American hegemony]{.underline}. For
them, imperialism had two crucial features. First of all, it involved a
system of geopolitical rivalries among the Great Powers. As the Liberal
J A Hobson (a major influence on Lenin) put it, "the novelty of recent
imperialism regarded as a policy consists chiefly in its adoption by
several nations. The notion of a number of competing empires is
essentially modern".6 Secondly, the emergence of these rivalries was a
consequence of a specific phase of capitalist development, as Lenin
underlines in his pamphlet Imperialism. [[The concentration and
centralisation of capital that Marx identifies in Capital, Volume I as
one of the main tendencies arising from the capitalist accumulation
process led by the beginning of the 20th century to the intersection of
economic and geopolitical competition. Capitals, increasingly large in
scale and operating internationally, came to depend on the support of
their nation state to defend their interests; equally, to maintain
themselves against their rivals, states had to promote the industrial
capitalist economies that alone could provide complex modern weapons
systems and the infrastructure of war.]{.underline}]{.mark} The growing
interdependence of states and capitals gave rise to the intensification
of geopolitical rivalries that exploded into world war in August 1914
and that produced a second bout of carnage in 1939-45.7 So from a
Marxist perspective, modern imperialism is a system of intercapitalist
competition and rivalry. Lenin's key contribution to the theory was the
concept of uneven development. [[Capitalism doesn't grow uniformly: some
states and regions leap ahead; others lag behind. This unevenness
defines the hierarchy of power in the world. But, crucially, the uneven
development of capitalism redistributes power among the leading states.
This means that the balance of power is constantly shifting, creating
the circumstances of new conflicts.]{.mark} The key geopolitical
development in the first half of the 20th century was the shift in
relative power between Britain, hitherto the dominant capitalist state,
and the US and Germany; today another shift in relative power is taking
place between the US and China.]{.underline} Changes of this nature,
Lenin insisted, make the peaceful transnational integration of capitals
that Karl Kautsky called "ultra-imperialism" and Michael Hardt and Toni
Negri have more recently named "Empire" impossible: the redistribution
of power among states undermines the deals that would be needed to make
such integration work.8

**Capital drives war---violence both domestically and internationally
are all results of the capitalistic desire for control and domination.
The results risk nuclear extinction and constant exploitation**

**Everest 12** Larry Everest, "WAR AND GLOBAL CAPITALISM: "Money for
Jobs Not for War": American Chauvinism and Reformist Illusions," Global
Research, 5/24/2012,
http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=31024

"Money for Jobs and Education! Jobs and Education, Not War and
Occupation!" This slogan put forth by several US social movements is
profoundly wrong and harmful---both in terms of morality that's actually
in the interests of humanity, and in terms of a scientific understanding
of imperialism and war. Why should antiwar demands focus first and
foremost on the war's impact on Americans and their lives---and not on
the victims of U.S. aggression: Pakistanis murdered in U.S. drone
strikes, Iraqis rounded up and tortured by U.S. forces, Afghans seized
and terrorized in night raids, and countless others? Aren't their lives
every bit as precious as the lives of those who happen to live in the
U.S.? "Money for jobs, not for war" argues that American lives are more
important than other people's lives. This logic goes right along
with---and amplifies---the mindset relentlessly fostered by the system's
rulers and their media machine: that American lives come first. This is
the very mindset the rulers count on to justify and build public support
(or acquiescence) for their predatory wars of empire. The slogan also
promotes the idea that the political powers-that-be---if pressured by
enough people---could scale back their military, stop attacking other
countries, and instead use the money for jobs, education, and other
social welfare programs at home. But that's not how the system actually
operates! [[Wars, invasions, and occupations are not policies of one set
of politicians or another, or arbitrary choices made by this or that
president]{.mark}.]{.underline} At this stage in history[[, capitalism
is a global system, with the U.S. the world's most dominant
capitalist-imperialist power, presiding over a worldwide empire of
exploitation. This empire rests on the domination of the oppressed
countries where the vast majority of humanity lives, and on control of
labor, markets, and resources. This entails the violent suppression of
the masses of people in the dominated areas]{.underline}]{.mark}---and
also entails fighting off challenges from other imperialists as well as
rising forces in those countries that stand in the way. [[This requires
a monstrously huge military that is deployed worldwide]{.mark}, with
bases in over 100 countries, and [wars when
necessary]{.mark}.]{.underline} The wars for domination in the Middle
East, Central Asia, and elsewhere don't "interfere" with the functioning
of U.S. capital---they're absolutely essential to it, and to the U.S.'s
overall global dominance. This is why the U.S. rulers are
compelled---and willing to---spend trillions on the military, including
during periods of severe economic and fiscal stress, no matter who
happens to sit in the White House or Congress[[. This system of global
capitalism-imperialism headed by the U.S. is the main source of the
horrors that torment so many across the
globe]{.underline}]{.mark}---[from the ethnic cleansing and slow
genocide of the Palestinian people by the U.S. and Israel, to the mass
incarceration and slow genocide of Black people in the U.S.; from the
rape of the planet to the systematic degradation and violence against
women---here and around the world; from the extreme deprivation and
starvation faced by billions across the planet to the growing poverty
and desperation faced by millions in the U.S. [The rulers in these
imperial metropoles distribute some of the spoils of empire to provide a
higher standard of living than in the oppressed countries and buy social
peace and loyalty at hom]{.mark}e]{.underline} (which "Money for Jobs,
Not For War" encourages). People in the U.S. should reject that foul
pact! The vast majority in the U.S. have a profound interest in making
common cause with oppressed people worldwide, not in siding with "their"
rulers. That means fostering a morality that declares: "American lives
are not more important than other people's lives!"---not pandering to
American chauvinism, which strengthens the system responsible for so
much misery. It means people shouldn't appeal to those on the top to
"spend more on jobs," but to clearly and unequivocally demand a STOP to
the horrors the U.S. is committing around the world. [Through this
process of actively opposing U.S. aggression and the "America Number 1"
mindset fostered to justify it[, people can and must be won to
increasingly see that this capitalist system and state is utterly
un-reformable and that it's going to take revolution to get rid of it,
end its predatory wars once and for all, and bring into being a whole
new system and state that is in the actual interests of the people in
the U.S. and around the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Yemen

#### Capitalism IS the proximate cause of the Yemen conflict and people are fighting back!

**MARCHETTI 19** (Jacobin, we won't load your ships of death, Giacomo
Marchetti is an Italian docker.
<https://jacobinmag.com/author/giacomo-marchetti>) **Wolfy UwU**

[Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia's deadly airstrikes have visited
destruction on the people of Yemen, killing almost 18,000 and leaving
most of the population at near-starvation levels. The Saudi bombing
campaign is intended to suppress the Houthi rebels who have taken over
the capital Sana'a and much of the west of the country, but it is also a
proxy for a wider regional conflict with Iran. Thus far, the Saudi
tyrants in Riyadh have been able to count on Western backing --- and
weapons. Yet as scrutiny of their war crimes intensifies, the edifice of
support is beginning to crack. On June 20 the Senate voted to block
Donald Trump's plans for \$8 billion of weapons shipments, just hours
after a ruling by the UK Court of Appeal forced Theresa May's government
to suspend arms sales to Riyadh.]{.underline} Yet the first resistance
came elsewhere --- from the workers meant to make the arms shipments
happen. [On May 10, the Bahri Yanbu was unable to dock in Le Havre as
workers refused to accept the Saudi vessel, and ten days later their
counterparts in Genoa went on strike rather than load the
ship.]{.underline} On May 28 members of the CGT union in Marseille
similarly boycotted a Canadian weapons cargo headed for Saudi Arabia on
the Bahri Tabuk. [The workers in all three ports made clear that they
weren't willing to be mere cogs in Saudi Arabia's war machine, refusing
point blank to load what they called the "ships of death." Indeed, when
fresh news spread that another ship called the Bahri Yazan was going to
dock in Genoa last Thursday, workers and antiwar activists in the
northwest Italian city were quick to mobilize, with protests and a
further strike call. **The result was again humiliation for the Saudis,
as port authorities were forced to guarantee that the workers would not
have to load weapons onto the ship**]{.underline}. Yet the fight to cut
off supplies to the Saudi war machine is far from over. Jacobin's David
Broder spoke to one of the Genoa dockers, Giacomo Marchetti, about his
colleagues' action, the political response, and how workers can take
direct action against war and militarism. [On May 20 the Genoa dockers
refused to load weapons onto the Bahri Yanbu, showing that you were
unwilling to help Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. Where did the decision to
take this action come from, and what do you think it
achieved?]{.underline} The traffic of arms through the port was nothing
new. It was something that our Autonomous Port Workers' Collective
(CALP) had publicly denounced on several occasions. But this didn't
receive any particular media attention, or indeed an adequate response
from political or trade-union organizations. Like many aspects of what
goes on in the docks, this arms trafficking was a "taboo." We see the
same thing with the shipments of other dangerous goods, and the
situation of insecurity the workers are forced to operate within. It's
all part of a kind of pact (also in part including the unions) which
sacrifices everything else on the altar of the maritime business, on the
basis of a sort of omertà. You could say the same of the long-standing
failure to plan any road-based alternative to the heavy traffic over the
Ponte Morandi (the bridge in Genoa that collapsed on August 14, 2018,
killing forty-three people). But a series of factors --- firstly the
blockade carried out by port workers in Le Havre and a positive response
among activists in Genoa --- led to a change of pace. Under strong
pressure from the workers' delegates, as the Bahri Yanbu was approaching
Genoa the FILT-CGIL union called a strike. A blockade was called the day
that the main shipment was meant to be loaded. A group of workers thus
gave their own kind of "welcome" to the Saudi vessel. Another important
factor in getting people to mobilize for the first blockade was the
"pre-electoral" climate (it took place just days before the European
elections) as well as the clear position taken by a vast array of
associations, including ones of a Catholic orientation. That said,
ultimately it was a group of "inglorious bastards" among the dockers,
and their determination to ramp things up a notch and create a
precedent, that proved decisive to making the strike call happen. As for
what we've succeeded in doing, we've made people start talking about the
long-overlooked conflict in Yemen[**. We've made them talk about the
traffic of Western-made weapons that feed wars causing vast humanitarian
disasters. And we've reasserted collective action as a tool for
addressing the problems in front of us --- including in response to
issues whose importance extends beyond our own workplaces.** This was a
beginning. And after our action on May 20, eight days later the dockers
in Marseilles did the same.]{.underline} How did the Port Authority and
the local prefect respond to your action? On June 19 another Saudi ship
came to Genoa. Can you be sure there won't be further efforts to use the
port to send arms for Saudi Arabia to use in the Yemen conflict? [We
know that the traffic of weapons will, indeed, continue. It's our
responsibility to monitor it, point it out where it's happening, **and
take the necessary action in response.**]{.underline} We've long noted a
certain nervousness on the other side \[i.e., the Port Authority\],
after they initially tried to deny some undeniable truths. They've been
evasive about the nature of the cargo that was meant to be loaded, its
final destination or how it was going to be used. [Here, we are talking
about military-spec engine-generators that have received a kind of
authorization necessary for the traffic of weapons destined for the
Saudi Guard, a military corps deployed on the Yemeni front with three
brigades totaling 30,000 men ...]{.underline} Ultimately the maritime
agency, acting under the indications of the arms manufacturer Teknel,
issued a communication to the Port Authority saying it would not load
the weapons. This was the result of pressure that produced an
information counteroffensive over the previous week --- which also had
an echo in the wider media --- but also the protest outside the Port
Authority on Wednesday, June 19, and plans for a strike and a dawn
picket at the main entry to the port the following day. Yet once the
official communication came in on the Wednesday evening, and a
delegation had been received by the Port Authority, we decided together
with the people present at the protest that our demands had been
satisfied, even as we continued to monitor the situation. How are you
organized? What other movements are involved in the protests? Is the
CALP port workers' collective part of the trade union? The CALP isn't a
trade union or part of it, but a body made up of workers, delegates, and
other comrades who contribute at different levels. Over the years it has
become a well-regarded point of reference both within and outside the
docks. It has established a relationship of trust in practice,
especially through the central idea of "working-class combat" --- the
readiness of some of the workers (even if a minority) to enter into
confrontations on key questions, which aren't necessarily linked to the
port itself. It makes its voice heard in a way that some might consider
a bit "pyrotechnic" or overly direct. But as in this case, that's often
an effective way of doing things! Of course, there's historical
precedents for this kind of action --- take the London dockers who in
1920 refused to load the munitions that were meant for the war against
the young USSR. Do you have similar traditions in Genoa The port of
Genoa has always been at the center of solidarity actions against
imperialist war --- from the war in Vietnam to the war in Iraq, not to
mention the resistance against Pinochet in Chile. Our action followed in
this same internationalist vein. We took this action even though
conditions are difficult given the wider balance of class forces and the
difficulty of asserting any narrative in today's Italy that goes beyond
setting the very-worst-off against the next-worst-off, for instance
dividing the Italian poor from migrants. One of our slogans is "close
the ports to weapons and open them up to people," together with "an
injury to one is an injury to all." That doesn't just concern the ports,
or even Italy. We were also in solidarity with Donbass, Catalonia, and
Rojava. But this time the action was much more effective and visible.
That's what troubles the "party of war" stretching from the neoliberal
Democratic Party to the fascist scum. The fact that a part of the
working class in Italy and France conducted this internationalist action
should make people reflect on the falseness of certain narratives about
what workers think, with which some people meant to be on the Left have
intoxicated the public debate. [We'll continue to fight on the questions
this dispute has raised, deepening our analysis and developing our means
of action. We'll do so thanks to the aid of those outside Genoa working
on the same issues. We have made a crack in the war machine --- now we
need to open it up further, for those who make war should never be left
at peace.]{.underline}

###  Socialism w/ Chinese Characteristics

#### Vote neg to align yourself with the People's Republic of China and the global liberation that its rise heralds. Cast away the illusions of imperialism in the face of the spectacular possibility of the productive forces of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. Dare to struggle! Dare to win!

**Singh 18** \[Ajit Singh, lawyer and writer, *China's rise threatens
U.S. imperialism, not American people*, *Monthly Review Online*, Apr 09,
2018, //Stefan\]

This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's "reform and opening up,"
initiated in 1978. At that time, although living standards had
significantly improved following the socialist revolution in 1949---life
expectancy nearly doubling in the first 30 years---China still faced
tremendous challenges. Seeking to overcome the country's severe
underdevelopment, the West's monopoly over technology, and the isolation
to which it had been subjected to during the Cold War by the United
States, China implemented reforms in order to promote economic growth
and development. Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of the policy, summed up
the Communist Party's thinking in three simple clauses: "Our country
must develop. If we do not develop then we will be bullied. Development
is the only hard truth." Four decades later, the success of reform is
undeniable: [China has lifted 800 million people out poverty---more than
the rest of the world combined during the same period---and generated
"the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in
history]{.underline}," according to the World Bank. [China's GDP growth
has averaged nearly 10 percent a year over a 40-year period, without
crises, with the country becoming a world leader in science, technology
and innovation. Rising from extreme poverty to international power,
China now has the world's second largest economy, and is generally
expected to overtake the U.S. in GDP terms within the next two decades.
Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, China's economy has
already surpassed the U.S.]{.underline} When beginning its reform,
[China sought to "keep a low profile" and "bide its time, while building
up strength", as the U.S. led an international offensive, destructively
imposing neoliberalism on countries throughout the global
South]{.underline}. Today[, we are in the midst of a turning
point.]{.underline} Announcing to the world that it is entering a "new
era" at last year's National Congress of the Communist Party, [China is
playing a more assertive and leading role in global
affairs.]{.underline} The country's trillion-dollar Belt and Road
Initiative---called "the largest single infrastructure program in human
history"---involves over 70 countries and 1,700 development projects
connecting Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Meanwhile, [mired in
economic stagnation and decline, the U.S. is its losing international
authority.]{.underline} In particular, during the "America First"-era,
[the country's reputation has plummeted, as the Trump administration
unilaterally withdraws from international institutions and agreements,
displays open bigotry towards developing countries, and eschews
diplomacy for insulting arrogance and genocidal threats]{.underline}.
U.S. hostility towards China increases That China and the U.S. are
moving in opposite directions is not a new phenomenon, but this trend
has been brought into sharp focus under Trump. [Growing anxious about
its diminishing global dominance, the U.S. demonstrates increasing
hostility towards China.]{.underline} In a series of recent policy
statements -- the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy,
Nuclear Posture Review, and State of the Union address -- the Trump
administration has repeatedly identified the "threat" posed by "economic
and military ascendance" of China, declaring that "\[i\]nter-state
strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S.
national security." It is claimed that China, along with Russia, "want
to shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and interests." In response
to this "danger," the Trump administration is pursuing a substantial
buildup in U.S. military forces, viewing "more lethal" and "unmatched
power \[as\] the surest means of our defense." Trump's 2019 budget
proposes a massive increase in Pentagon spending to \$716 billion and he
has assembled a war cabinet to make use of it, including extreme hawks
and noted anti-China hardliners such as John Bolton, Mike Pompeo and
Peter Navarro. These moves come after top U.S. military officer, General
Joseph Dunford, called China the country's "greatest threat" and U.S.
Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Harris, new ambassador to Australia,
told Congress in February that the U.S. must prepare for war with China.
Washington is increasing military pressure on Beijing: ratcheting up
tensions on the Korean peninsula; taking steps to construct a
"quadrilateral" alliance with right-wing governments in India, Japan and
Australia, targeting China; and passing the Taiwan Travel Act which
violates the "One China" policy and encourages the U.S. "to send senior
officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa" On
the economic front, the Trump administration seeks to launch a "trade
war" with Beijing and form a broad anti-China alliance, proposing \$50
billion in tariffs targeting Chinese imports (and threatening \$100
billion more), launching an investigation into technology transfers to
China, and lodging formal complaints at the World Trade Organization on
"the state's pervasive role in the Chinese economy." Washington is
increasingly regulating and monitoring inbound Chinese investment,
outbound U.S. investment in China, and joint ventures. Viewing
technological dominance as a pillar of its international authority,
Washington considers China's development and technological advance to be
an "existential economic threat." As this animosity increases, U.S.
rhetoric towards China calls to mind the virulent anti-communism of the
Cold War and racist "yellow peril" phantoms of decades past. Newly
appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently warned that China was
trying "to infiltrate the United States with spies -- with people who
are going to work on behalf of the Chinese government against America
... We see it in our schools. We see it in our hospitals and medicals
systems. We see it throughout corporate America. It's also true in other
parts of the world ... including Europe and the UK." Similarly, FBI
director Christopher Wray told Congress in February that "the whole of
Chinese society" is a threat to the U.S. That such belligerent
statements can be made towards 1.4 billion people, one-fifth of
humanity, without receiving any challenge from Democrats, Republicans or
the corporate-owned media, is an indication of the consensus around the
"China threat" theory in the U.S. establishment, and the danger this
poses. A new Cold War Washington's hostility towards Beijing is rooted
in the foundation of modern U.S. foreign policy. The fall of the Soviet
Union in 1991 and end of the Cold War, ushered in an era during which
the U.S. has sought to establish unipolar global dominance. Explicitly
outlined in a 1992 Defense Policy Guidance paper authored under
neoconservative Paul Wolfowitz, the principal objective of U.S. foreign
policy in this period has been "to prevent the re-emergence of a new
rival" capable of challenging U.S. aspirations for global hegemony. In
the quarter-century since, the U.S. has aggressively pursued this aim,
engaging in endless wars, "regime change" efforts, and military
build-ups around the world, now operating over 900 military bases
globally. Despite these most destructive efforts, the U.S. has been
unable to stop China's momentous rise, which has emerged as the primary
obstacle to U.S. aims for unipolar dominance. Although Washington has
sought regime change in Beijing ever since the socialist revolution of
1949, the U.S. has generally pursued a strategy of "containment through
engagement" following the normalisation of bilateral relations in the
1970s. In part, Washington had hoped that China's economic reform and
the fall of the Soviet Union would lead to political reform in Beijing
and the abandonment of Communist Party leadership and socialism with
Chinese characteristics, in favour of Western-oriented neoliberalism.
History has confirmed that China has no such intention. Recognizing its
own declining leverage and that China will not become "more like us",
Washington is attempting to launch a new Cold War against China. The
identification of China as the primary target of U.S. foreign policy
originated during the Obama era with the "Asia pivot" seeking to
encircle China, shifting 60 percent of U.S. naval assets to Asia by
2020. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton argued that the U.S. must
reorient the focus of its foreign policy from the Middle East to the
Asia-Pacific to ensure "continued American leadership well into this
century." The developments under Trump, mark an escalation of this
bipartisan strategy. The unipolar-multipolar struggle The importance of
U.S.-China relations cannot be overstated, with the two countries at the
core of a broader unipolar-multipolar struggle over the shape of the
international order. While the U.S. seeks to secure global dominance,
China's rise is central to a multipolarisation trend, in which multiple
centres of power are emerging to shape a negotiated, more democratic
world. China's political orientation has been fundamentally shaped by
its history of subjugation to foreign powers during its "century of
humiliation" and anti-imperialist struggle for national liberation.
[Under the leadership of the Communist Party, China has always
identified itself as part of the Third World or global South and the
collective struggle of formerly colonized and oppressed nations against
the global inequality wrought by imperialism. Under the banner of
"South-South cooperation", China continues to champion this collective
struggle today, promoting greater say for developing countries in global
governance and the construction of a rules-based international order in
place of the unilateral actions of major powers, in]{.underline}
particular the U.S. More than mere rhetoric, China provides crucial
investment, infrastructure construction, technology transfers, debt
forgiveness, and diplomatic support to developing countries. Most
importantly, unlike the U.S. and West which engage in destructive
foreign interventions, [China abides by the principle of
non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and does not
impose conditions on its relations.]{.underline} China's respect for the
self-determination of other countries has [made it an indispensable
partner for nations resisting foreign domination and pursuing
independent development]{.underline}, including Cuba, Venezuela,
Bolivia, Zimbabwe, Syria, Iran, and North Korea. It is for this reason
that the late Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro declared in 2004 that
"China has objectively become the most promising hope and the best
example for all Third World countries ... an important element of
balance, progress and safeguard of world peace and stability."
Venezuelan foreign minister Jorge Arreaza echoed these sentiments last
December, saying "Thank God humanity can count on China," as his country
faces sanctions, economic sabotage, and threats of regime change from
the U.S. Contributing to the declining global authority of the U.S,
China's international relations have prompted Washington to cynically
accuse China of fostering dependency in Africa and being an "imperial
power" towards Latin America. In fact, rather than behaving in a
predatory manner, [China provides sorely needed funding, on favorable
terms, to African borrowers, and as we have seen above China supports
Latin America's struggle against imperialism.]{.underline} That [China
is praised by fiercely independent nations of the global
South]{.underline} and faces such charges from the U.S.---the most
powerful empire in history---reveals the absurdity of such claims.
Anxious about its own decline, the U.S. seeks to both drive a wedge
between China and the South, and also restrict the right of developing
nations to choose their own partners and path. China has demonstrated
that its rise is compatible with the self-determination of other
nations---whether capitalist or socialist; what it comes into
contradiction with is U.S. imperialism. It is important to recognize
that U.S. hostility towards China is not simply a product of narrow
competition with the Asian power, it is a resistance to the empowerment
of the global South and democratization of international relations.
[China is the primary target of U.S. imperialism because of its
strategic importance at the heart of the world multipolarisation trend,
which threatens to bring an end to U.S. international supremacy and 500
years of Western global dominance.]{.underline} An opportunity for
ordinary Americans For years, the U.S. political establishment has
sought to leverage American workers in its struggle against China.
Endless rhetoric about how China is "stealing U.S. jobs" seeks to stir
up xenophobia and racism in order divert attention from the fact that it
was Washington and U.S. corporations that implemented the neoliberal
reforms which hollowed out America's economy. On a near daily basis, the
corporate-owned media further promotes hostility towards China with
hawkish, sensationalized and dishonest reporting. In recent months,
Americans have been told that China, with its "model of totalitarianism
for the 21st century", "has a plan to rule the world", that its "'long
arm' of influence stretches ever further", its "fingerprints are
everywhere" as it "infiltrates" U.S. classrooms, colleges, and more. The
message is clear: be afraid. However, for ordinary Americans,
multipolarity and [the strengthening of]{.underline} international
forces, like [China,]{.underline} which challenge U.S. imperialism are
not a threat. Instead, this [offers the potential for progressive
advances for the American people in their own struggles.]{.underline}
The 20th century provides a historical precedent for this, where the
existence of the Soviet Union and a concrete socialist alternative to
capitalism along with the wave of Third World national liberation
struggles, placed pressure on Western capitalist countries, including
the U.S., to respond to their own people's demands for progressive
social and economic policies, such as the welfare state, higher taxes on
the wealthy, and anti-racist measures. Similarly, today, [as the U.S.
and the world face tremendous social, economic and environmental
challenges, Chinese socialism is demonstrating a concrete alternative to
the dominant capitalist system: pledging to eradicate poverty by 2020;
with wage growth soaring and real income for the bottom half of earners
growing 401 percent since 1978 (compared to falling by one percent in
the U.S. during that time); declaring healthcare to be a universal human
right; praised for having the "best response to the world's
environmental crisis" and reducing pollution in cities by an average of
32% in just four years since declaring a "war on pollution"; becoming "a
world leader in wind, solar, nuclear and electric vehicles"; building
the world's longest bullet-train network, spending more on
infrastructure than the U.S. and Europe combined; and announcing that
inequality, not economic underdevelopment, is now the "principal
contradiction" to be addressed in Chinese society. China is able to
prioritize social and environmental policies---while sustaining rapid,
crisis-free economic growth for four decades---because, unlike the U.S.,
the interests of corporations and wealthy do not rise above political
authority.]{.underline} [China's wealthy regularly face severe
repercussions for criminal behaviour (instead of bailouts). For example,
an annual list of China's richest citizens is commonly called the "death
list" or "kill pigs list" because those named are often later imprisoned
or executed]{.underline}---according to one study 17% of the time. While
China is not a perfect society and continues to face many challenges,
[the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics has been able to
respond to a number of pressing issues facing the world today, better
than the U.S. capitalist system. This is likely why China leads the
world in optimism, with 87% feeling the country is headed in the right
direction, compared to only 43% feeling the same in the
U.S]{.underline}. The new Cold War that Washington seeks to launch
against China requires massive increases in military spending, paid for
by ordinary Americans with massive cuts to already inadequate social
programs, housing support and health care. If the American people can
reject the Cold War mentality of their ruling class and arrogant notions
of "American exceptionalism", China's rise could offer them the
opportunity to learn how to build a society that better meets their
needs.

### Marxist IR

#### The alternative is to reject the aff as a mode of interrogation through Marxist IR theory -- Marxism is not a theory, it is a tool of critique that locates the historical contingency of phenomena -- the alternative closes the gap between Marxism and the political to enable revolutionary socialist praxis

**Davenport 11**\
(Andrew Davenport, University of Sussex, UK. "Marxism in IR: Condemned
to a Realist fate?" European Journal of International Relations 19(1)
<http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1354066111416021> cVs)

The concept of the political exists as something repressed within
Marxist theorizing, something thought to be long since overcome that yet
persists in making its presence painfully felt. [[None of the leading
Marxist approaches]{.mark} extant [within IR has sought to subject the
political]{.mark} itself [to theory.]{.mark}]{.underline}25 Rather, it
appears as an element that is simply given, immediate. [[The
consequences can be read in the entanglement of Marxism]{.mark}, both as
theory and practice, [in]{.mark} the historical fate prescribed by
[Realism]{.mark}, the perdurable fragmentation and anarchy of
international politics.]{.underline} This failure to inquire into the
meaning and significance of the political is referable back to the
ambivalence of Marx's own theoretical practice. On the one hand, 'Marx
consigned the whole sphere of politics to ideology' (Adorno, 2000: 143).
There is a moment of world-historical freedom, not to be discarded, in
this brusquely achieved rupture. The hardened surface of the social is
broken through: no longer is society to be entranced and deluded, in its
self-understanding, by forms of appearance: politics, law, religion and
philosophy. Politics is not, any more than any of the others, to be
hypostasized into something existing in-itself, something autonomous and
self-sufficient, something ontological. Rather, it receives all its
substance and contents from elsewhere, from the societally mediated
process of the interaction of humans with nature: In the whole
conception of history up to the present this real basis of history has
either been totally neglected or else considered as a minor matter quite
irrelevant to the course of history. History must, therefore, always be
written according to an extraneous standard; the real production of life
seems to be primeval history, while the truly historical appears to be
separated from ordinary life, something extra-superterrestrial. With
this the relation of man to nature is excluded from history and hence
the antithesis of nature and history is created. The exponents of this
conception of history have consequently only been able to see in history
the political actions of princes and States, religious and all sorts of
theoretical struggles. (Marx and Engels, 1968: 51) [Marx's historical
materialism, dedicated to the primacy of the economic as the mode of
society's self-reproduction, had in the mid-19th century, and continues
to have, a decisively progressive aspect: the founders of historical
materialism 'wished for the revolution as one of the economic
relationships in society as a whole, in the fundament of its
self-preservation, not as the changing of the ground-rules of
domination, its political form']{.underline} (Adorno, 2001: 'Antagonism
contingent?'). [Only such a change in the basis of society's existence
could bring about the world-historical transformation that Marx and
Engels hoped for, the break from pre-history.]{.underline} The failure
of the revolution of 1848 surely impressed upon Marx the necessity of a
better theoretical grasp of the essence of society: the
decades-researched, never completed study of political economy seeks
precisely to lay bare how it is that modern society actually reproduces
itself, what form the interaction with nature takes in capitalist
society, what it means that the object is a commodity. Yet, [[at the
same time that the]{.mark} ideological [appearance of politics is
stripped away]{.mark} by devastating criticism, [the political itself is
left standing]{.mark}; the content of politics is revealed as arising
out of the antagonistic nature of society's mode of reproduction, the
organization of the exploitation of nature, but the form of the
political, the space in which politics takes place,]{.underline}26 [is
not subjected to critique.]{.underline} [If politics is seen through as
appearance, [it]{.mark} is nevertheless not explained how the societal
process of the productive interaction with nature generates the
distinctive form of the political that Realism insists upon --- its
delimitation and, on the global level, fractured, multiple
existence.]{.underline} The critique of political economy can be
considered a quasi-transcendental account of economics --- What are the
conditions of possibility for such a thing as an 'economy' to exist at
all? --- but no such radical questioning is brought to bear on the
political element: it is not explained why economics is political
economy. So the political itself remains obscure, unillumined by the
light of critique, with the result that the relationship between the
categories derived from the critique of the societal production process
and the political existence of humans remains unarticulated.
Paradigmatically, [in the Communist Manifesto [Marx and Engels write
both that 'the working men have no country']{.mark}]{.underline} (2002:
241) [[and that 'the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie
is]{.mark} at first [a national struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters
with its own bourgeoisie' (2002: 232). [[The proletariat]{.mark} both
[transcends the national context and yet is bound to it i]{.mark}n a
relationship that is never properly explicated. ']{.underline}Since the
proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to
be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation,
it is, so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the
word' (Marx and Engels, 2002: 241; emphasis in original). But in what
sense of the word? [[The nation,]{.mark} the modern political community,
[remains]{.mark} in Marx's thought [the scene of the drama]{.mark} even
[despite]{.mark} the sublation of [the class
struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline} The form of the political is to be filled
with a radically different content, but it is never made clear whether
or how this revolutionary change of content itself changes the nature of
the form.27 Consequently, despite being roughly negated (at least as
high politics), [[the politica]{.mark}l continually [recurs throughout
Marx's oeuvre in a]{.mark} theoretically [undigested way as marking out
the space within which revolutionary activity is to take
place]{.mark}]{.underline}, from the early critical works motivated by
the experience of German backwardness in relation to Britain and France,
through the texts on the failure of revolutionary struggle in France, to
the late Critique of the Gotha Programme and documents for the First
International. **[[The contradiction of internationalism and national
revolution remains]{.mark} latent and unresolved, indeed
[unacknowledged.]{.mark}]{.underline}**28 This ambivalence towards the
political, its simultaneous negation and retention, is preserved within
the Marxist tradition right through to the various strands of Marxism
within contemporary IR. The World-Systems theorists and Political
Marxists, for instance, are at an extreme in their refusal to grant any
theoretical substance to the specificity of the political, to how and
why a bounded political space is created, and yet the political is
continually and massively present within their work, at least at a brute
empirical level --- how could it not be, when their studies are entirely
devoted to analysing the differential development of political
communities within the growth of capitalism? The same is true generally
of Marxism within IR: the political is always there (necessarily, given
that so much of IR Marxism takes the form of historical-sociological
studies) but almost invariably as an unacknowledged element, something
regarded as unproblematic, something not worked through theoretically.
Where Marxist historical sociology has broached the question of the
political (Rosenberg, 2010), it has been unable to grasp it
conceptually; and where, exceptionally, Marxism has attempted a
conceptual treatment (Bromley, 2010),29 it has effectively conceded to
Realist political fragmentation: 'In respect of political order ... the
Humean predicament is the human predicament' (Bromley, 2010: 245). But,
[[as a theory of freedom, Marxism cannot afford such a
concession;]{.mark} for it is precisely [the form of the
political]{.mark} that [Realism says creates the anarchic]{.mark},
[unchanging]{.mark} and essentially [conflictual arena of the
international]{.mark}, and [which forces each community into the
fatality of the unending struggle for self-preservation]{.mark} that is
the condition [of international politics.]{.mark}]{.underline}30 If this
deficiency within Marxist thought concerning political form is traceable
back to Marx's own thinking, then [[the solution to the problem]{.mark}
of the political [is not]{.mark} to be [straightforwardly found within
the Marxian corpus.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It is necessary]{.mark},
instead, [for Marxism in IR to extend]{.mark} its reach [beyond]{.mark}
the prevailing interest in [historical-sociological studies of
processes]{.mark} of development [and to engage critically with]{.mark}
the tradition of political theory]{.underline}:31 **[above all, with
such central categories as [sovereignty and legal
order.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The model for such an engagement remains,
nevertheless, the manner of Marx's own approach to bourgeois political
economy: [he neither rejected the categories developed by classical
political economy in favour of a 'socialist' alternative, nor did he
simply accept them at face value.]{.underline} Rather, [[he interrogated
them in such depth, exposing their]{.mark} social [mediatedness, as to
demonstrate that the political economists did not understand their own
concepts.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[It is through this labour of
conceptual investigation that Marx broke the naturalization of]{.mark}
the categories of [bourgeois society]{.mark} characteristic of political
economy.]{.underline}**32 **[[This, also, is the way to escape Realist
essentializing in IR.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Just as Marx's theory of
capital implies the question of how a society, indeed a world, of
generalized exchange is possible, how it is that humans could totalize
exchange such that every object becomes a commodity, an economic thing,
so, [[in IR, the problem of the political demands investigation into how
humans could make themselves 'sovereign',]{.mark} an autonomous source
of law, [and how the world could be transformed into political
space.]{.mark}]{.underline} The premise of Marx's theoretical
investigations is that [[it is necessary to understand]{.mark} the being
of [capitalist society]{.mark}, what it actually is, [if it is to be
transcended]{.mark}: only through investigating the conditions of
possibility of the society ruled by value does it become possible to
think what might be beyond universal commodity exchange.]{.underline}
Analogously, [for Marxist thinking in IR, **it [is only through
interrogating]{.mark} the fundamental [categories of political
thought,]{.mark} exposing what is involved in their constitution, [that
it might be possible to think beyond the delimited,]{.mark}
particularist [form of the political]{.mark} naturalized by Realism,
[and to escape entrapment in the fateful condition of the
international.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

###  Party

#### **The Party is key for anti-capitalist strategizing and organizing---it promotes democratic organizing and accountability**

**Bensaïd 11** (Daniel Bensaïd, July 5th 2011, "Strategy and Party",
translation by Nathan Rao, International Viewpoint,
<http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/IMG/article_PDF/article_a2198.pdf>,
Accessed 7-14-19, pages 7-8)//sjp

The final point I wanted to take up is the question of the party. It\'s
not a technical question - that is to say, it\'s not a matter of saying
that we have a strategy and therefore need the instrument best suited to
it. [No, the question of the party is actually central to the strategic
question itself. A strategy without a party is like a military officer
who has battle plans and maps from army headquarters but no troops or
army. There can only be a strategy when there is a force that supports
it, teases it out and translates it into practice day by day. This is
the whole difference between the notion of the party in the big Social
Democratic parties before 1914 and Lenin\'s notion of the
party.]{.underline} (Today, poor old Lenin isn\'t very popular, even on
the Left and even on the radical Left. He\'s described as being
authoritarian and so on, and I think that\'s grossly unfair. But that\'s
not today\'s topic.) How did Lenin change or even revolutionize the
notion of the party? The big Social Democratic parties saw their role as
essentially pedagogical, whereby it played the role of teacher. This was
based on a conception in which the mass movement had a kind of
spontaneous logic to which the party contributed ideas, with interesting
schools and so forth. As a famous Social Democratic leader from the
pre-1914 period said, the party\'s role is not to prepare for
revolution. [Lenin took the exact opposite approach. His view was that
the party should not limit itself to accompanying and informing the
experience of the masses, but should also take initiatives, lay down
objectives for struggle, suggest demands that correspond to a given
situation and, when the time comes, be in a position to guide
action]{.underline}. [This can be summarized in a formula: the notion
that prevailed during the glory days of the Second International was
that of a pedagogical or educational party; with Lenin and in the Third
International the prevailing notion was that of a strategizing party - a
party that organizes struggles based on suggested goals, that can also
organize and limit defeats by preparing a retreat when
necessary.]{.underline} A famous episode comes to mind. [The workers of
Petrograd and Moscow could have suffered a decisive defeat in July 1917
had there not been a party to organize a retreat and retake the
initiative. So the party isn\'t any ordinary instrument. It is
inseparable from the program and goal that we set for
ourselves]{.underline}. There\'s one more thing I\'d like to say to wrap
up my comments on the party question. For us, it\'s not just about
building a party for struggle, action, combat, and so forth. [It has to
be a democratic, pluralist party. This has occasionally been a problem
in our tradition; it has led to excesses, an obsession with tendencies,
and so forth.]{.underline} That can be useful sometimes, while other
times it is less so. Still, though, in spite of the drawbacks, we feel
very strongly about this. [Pluralism within the organization means that
we do not hold any definitive truths and that there is a constant
exchange between the party that we wish to build and the experiences of
the mass movement]{.underline}. Since these experiences are quite
diverse, this diversity may be reflected from time to time as currents
within our own ranks. There is an additional reason. We fight for a
pluralist society, and we believe that a plurality of parties is
possible within such a society - including a plurality of parties that
support socialism. [We take such a position on the basis of lessons
drawn from the experience of Stalinism]{.underline}. [It is only
logical, then, that we should develop democracy within our own
organizations, in our youth organizations and in the sections of the
International - but also in the work we seek to develop in unions and
social-movement organizations. It is essential that different views of
the world be reflected within common organizations - because this makes
struggles more effective; because there can\'t be unity without
democracy; and because we want broad unity against Sarkozy or
whomever]{.underline}. So democracy is a pre-condition for unity, not an
obstacle[. This democratic culture will play an important role in the
future, because bureaucracy and bureaucratization don\'t come from
Stalinism alone. Some believe this problem has gone the way of
Stalinism, but it definitely has not. Bureaucracy doesn\'t come from the
party --- or as some say today \"the party form\". Rather, it comes from
the social division of labour and inequality.]{.underline} Labour unions
and social-movement organizations aren\'t less bureaucratic than
parties - and are sometimes more so given that material interests are
involved. Third World NGOs, which live off subsidies from the Ford
Foundation or the German SPD\'s Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, are in large
measure just as bureaucratized and often even corrupt. [Bureaucracy
doesn\'t come from any specific organizational form. The roots of
bureaucracy are to be found in the division of labour between
intellectual and manual labour, in the unequal distribution of free
time, and so forth and so on]{.underline}. [This means that democracy in
society and in our organizations is the only weapon at our disposal.
This is even more important today, and I\'ll end on this point. There is
a widespread view that people are dragooned into a party, that it\'s
like the military --- with discipline, authority, the loss of each
member\'s individuality, and so forth. I think the exact opposite is
true.]{.underline} You can\'t be free all by yourself and you can\'t be
inspired all by yourself. [You become these things in an organization of
collective struggle, within the boundaries of your own individuality. If
you look at recent political experiences, parties, even our small
parties, remain the best form for resisting far worse forms of
bureaucratization and corruption by money --- notwithstanding their
drawbacks and the dangers of bureaucratization,. We live in a society
where money is everywhere and corrupts everything]{.underline}. [What
resistance can we put up to this? It isn\'t by moralizing, but rather by
organizing collective resistance against the power of
money.]{.underline} We are also up against the power of media, which is
sometimes one and the same as the power of money. Media tend to usurp
the language and spokespeople of social-movement organizations and
revolutionary organizations. A mechanism exists whereby media co-opt
political figures. It\'s the TV networks that decide that so-and-so has
a nice face, so-and-so looks good under the lights, so-and-so is nicer
to work with, and on it goes. They create stars, whereas we want to
maintain control over our words and our spokespeople. We don\'t believe
in supreme saviours and miracle workers. We know that what we do is the
result of collective experience and thinking. That\'s a lesson in
responsibility and humility. The major role of media in our societies
has undermined accountability. How many times have we seen people
promote a set of hare-brained ideas on TV one day and then move on to
something entirely different the following week - without ever having to
justify themselves and be accountable for what they have said? [When our
spokespeople speak - whether Francisco Louça in Portugal, Olivier
Besancenot in France or Franco Turigliatto in Italy - they are
accountable to hundreds and thousands of members. They are not
individuals speaking on a whim, on the basis of a fleeting emotion; they
speak on behalf of the collective and have responsibilities toward the
members who elected them. For us, this is further proof of our
democratic credentials. And contrary to what is often said, political
parties as we see them - and I\'m not talking about big electoralist
outfits - are the best method of putting up a specifically democratic
resistance to a world that is not democratic at all. Parties are one of
the links, one of the components of our conception of revolutionary
strategy]{.underline}

### Socialism from Below

#### The alternative is to affirm socialism from below -- socialism can only form in the intellectual blueprints of capitalism that the affirmative critiques -- the alternative reject the aff's utopian pessimism in favor of a vision for an egalitarian system

**Gasper, 09** (Phil; a philosophy professor in Madison, Wisconsin, is
editor of The Communist Manifesto: A Road Map to History's Most
Important Political Document (Haymarket Books), and writes a regular
feature in the ISR, Critical Thinking. "Reviving socialism from below,"
International Socialist Review, Issue #65: Critical Thinking)

But [in the second half of the nineteenth century, "socialist" came to
signify]{.underline} not merely concern with "the social question," but
[opposition to capitalism]{.underline} and support for some variety of
social ownership of the means of production. So, [while never abandoning
the term "communist," Marx and Engels also became quite happy to call
themselves socialists. What is most distinctive about the kind of
socialism that they supported, however, is that it can only be created
through the active participation of workers themselves]{.underline}. The
American Marxist Hal **[Draper called this]{.underline}** conception
"**[socialism from below]{.underline}**" [and contrasted it
with]{.underline} various varieties of "**[socialism from above," in
which an elite imposes change on a passive working class. Historically,
[most versions of]{.mark} self-described [socialism]{.mark}---including
both Stalinism and social democracy---[have been]{.mark} varieties of
"socialism [from above]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"
**[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from Marx and Engels'
perspective]{.underline} **[[was not genuine]{.mark} socialism at
all.]{.underline}** **[Unlike the utopian socialists, who drew up
intricate blueprints of post-capitalist society]{.underline}** (**[which
they]{.underline}** sometimes **[attempted to put into practice on a
small scale]{.underline}**), **[Marx and Engels never speculated on the
detailed organization of a future socialist or communist society. The
key task for them was building a movement to overthrow
capitalism.]{.underline}** [If and when that movement won power, it
would be up to the members of the new society to decide democratically
how it was to be organized, in the concrete historical circumstances in
which they found themselves]{.underline}. Nevertheless, Marx did comment
in a more general way about what could be expected to happen if workers
were able to seize control of the state. In the Critique of the Gotha
Program (1875), Marx notes that, [because [a socialist society
will]{.mark} not develop "on its own foundations" but will [emerge from
capitalist society, it]{.mark} [will]{.mark} therefore [be]{.mark} "[in
every respect]{.mark}, economically, morally, and intellectually, still
[stamped with the birthmarks of the old society]{.mark} from whose womb
it emerges."]{.underline} At this early stage of its development,
[although some goods and services (such as housing and health care)
would be provided to everyone, and although no one would grow rich at
the expense of others, work would be rewarded in proportion to a
person's contribution]{.underline}. [Only later, [when work has been
reorganized to become truly fulfilling]{.mark}, so that "labor has
become not only a means of life but life's prime want," and when the
level of production has consequently increased, will [it be possible to
go beyond market incentives]{.mark} and reward people not in accordance
with their individual contribution, but in accordance with what they
need to flourish]{.underline}. [MARX AND Engels' vision of **[socialism
from below is]{.mark}** not simply a historical curiosity]{.underline},
but [**[a vital part of successfully refashioning a socialist
movement]{.mark}** for the twenty-first centu]{.underline}ry. The
perspective of **[[socialism from below offers a way of navigating
between]{.mark} cautious [reformism, which aims to humanize
capitalism]{.mark} rather than to replace it]{.underline}**, **[[and
utopian fantasy, which constructs blueprints for a future society with
no strategy for their implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the
Nation's debate on socialism, the perspective of cautious reformism is
articulated most openly by the left-wing economist Robert Pollin.
**[Pollin]{.underline}** agrees that "socialism is desirable as a
longer-term vision of a just society," but **[argues that now is not the
time to "advance a case for full-throttle socialism]{.underline}**,"
because "we do not know what a socialist economy would look like, nor do
we know how to move from our current disintegrating neoliberalism to
something approximating socialism." Instead, Pollin advocates a
"realistic" approach of pushing "a social justice agenda" while
continuing to raise questions about how to go further. **[Socialists
certainly need to be realistic, and nobody on the left will object to
fighting for social justice, but the problems with Pollin's approach
emerge as soon as he looks at the concrete proposals he
offers.]{.underline}** [Even though the near collapse of the financial
system has opened a debate in the mainstream about whether the banks
should be nationalized, Pollin rejects this as too risky, arguing that
failures and scandals would continue under state control and that public
anger might be shifted from Wall Street to the federal
government.]{.underline} Instead [he advocates more
regulation]{.underline} of the private banking industry. [Similarly,
rather than a massive publicly funded research effort to develop new
energy sources and seriously tackle the environmental crisis, Pollin
proposes "large government incentives for private businesses to profit
from clean energy investments."]{.underline} The bottom line is that
**[Pollin's [reforms are so cautious that they fail to make any serious
challenge to the status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Instead,
[[**they**]{.mark} are little more than a recipe for [propping up
capitalism at vast public expense]{.mark}, which is precisely why they
are already the preferred policies of the Obama
administratio]{.underline}n. [The private banks have already gobbled up
hundreds of billions of dollars of public money and will likely require
hundreds of billions more]{.underline}. Meanwhile, as John Bellamy
Foster and others have argued, the idea of **[a market-based solution to
the environmental crisis is a fantasy.]{.underline}** **[Pollin's
[proposals are "realistic" only if our goal is to preserve the existing
system]{.mark} for as long as possible, [not if we hope to create a
movement to replace it.]{.mark} [This]{.mark} last idea [is
key]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The perspective of **[[socialism from below
does not reject]{.mark} the idea that we should demand [reforms]{.mark},
[but it measures success]{.mark} largely [in terms of whether the fight
helps to mobilize, energize, and radicalize a movement that can fight
for more]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The call for nationalizing the
banks]{.underline}**, for example, **[is important not because
socialists have a ready-made blueprint for how to run the financial
system, but because [a full-scale government takeover would be a further
blow to free market ideology]{.mark} and give people confidence to
demand more public encroachments into the private sector]{.underline}**.
**[Socialists need to argue]{.underline}**, first, **[that [the failure
of "socialism from above" is not an argument against]{.mark} the
[radical]{.mark} [democratic restructuring]{.mark} of society from
below]{.underline}** and, second, that **[[the key practical task is to
organize]{.mark} and encourage [people to engage in grass-roots struggle
to defend]{.mark} jobs and [wages, fight evictions]{.mark} and
foreclosures, [oppose racism,]{.mark} immigrant bashing [and other forms
of oppression]{.mark}, and to force federal, state, and local
governments to enact policies that will benefit people at the bottom of
society]{.underline}**. Ultimately, **[[socialism will succeed or fail
depending on whether the]{.mark} growing [anger]{.mark} against the
injustices and failures of the present system [can be channeled]{.mark}
into such [struggles]{.mark}, and whether they can be [linked]{.mark}
together [to create]{.mark} not just a call for change, but [a challenge
to the ruling order itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

###  Communist Education Key

#### **Global strategies are key for communist revolutions---education specifically is key for imaginatory world building**

**Bensaïd 11** (Daniel Bensaïd, July 5th 2011, "Strategy and Party",
translation by Nathan Rao, International Viewpoint,
<http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/IMG/article_PDF/article_a2198.pdf>,
Accessed 7-14-19, pages 2-3)//sjp

[To begin with, when we speak of strategy, tactics and even - in the
tradition of Italian comrades who know Gramsci - notions of wars of
position, wars of movement, and so on, we use a vocabulary that has been
borrowed from the military and especially from textbooks on military
history]{.underline}. This became part of the vocabulary of the workers
movement at the beginning of the 20th century. [That being said, though,
we should be very clear: when revolutionaries talk about strategy, it\'s
not only a matter of violent confrontations or military confrontations
with the state apparatus. Rather, what we are talking about is a series
of slogans and forms of political organization; and a set of politics,
all aimed at transforming the world.]{.underline} Secondly, the question
of strategy has two complementary dimensions in the history of the
working-class movement. For starters, there is the question of how to
take power in a given country. This comes from the notion that
revolution begins with the conquest of power in one country, or in
several, but in either case on the level of nations, within which class
relations and the relationship of forces are organized on the basis of a
specific history, specific social gains, and a specific set of
relationships set down in law. This side of the question - the conquest
of power in a single country such as Bolivia or Venezuela today, and
let\'s hope in a European country sometime soon - is still very much on
the agenda and is fundamental. Saying this stands in contrast to the
claims of certain currents --- such as those in Latin America and Italy
inspired by Antonio Negri --- who believe that the question of the
conquest of power in a single country is outdated and perhaps even
reactionary because it limits struggles within the framework of
individual nations. [We believe that the question of the struggle for
power still begins on the level of the national relationship of forces,
but that is ever more closely intertwined with the second dimension of
the strategic question - that of strategy on an international,
continental and now global scale]{.underline}. This was already the case
at the beginning of the 20th century; and hence the meaning of the idea
of permanent revolution - where it was a matter of beginning to settle
the matter of revolution in one or several countries, while the question
of socialism was immediately raised by the extension of the revolution
to an entire continent or to the whole world. [This question was
fundamental for revolutionaries of Lenin, Trotsky and Rosa Luxemburg\'s
generation and it is even more so for us today. We see confirmation of
this in Venezuela, where oil can be nationalized and a certain degree of
independence from imperialism can be achieved, but this remains limited
so long as the revolutionary process has not been extended to Bolivia,
Ecuador and as a project for all of Latin America, which is the
Bolivarian Revolution]{.underline}. So we have this two-fold problem -
that of taking power in certain countries but with a view to using this
as a springboard for spreading the social revolution internationally.
[One final introductory remark: the problem with revolutionary strategy
is that it means taking up a real challenge that is not resolved in
Marx\'s work. Workers in general - the working class - are ground down
not only physically but also morally and intellectually by the
conditions of exploitation]{.underline}. In page after page of Capital,
Marx describes the abasement that comes from work, the absence of
leisure and the impossibility of finding time to enjoy life, to read and
to learn. [How can a class that endures such total oppression
simultaneously be capable of imagining and building a new
society]{.underline}? Marx suggests that the problem would be resolved
in an almost natural fashion: the industrialization of the late 19th
century was creating an increasingly concentrated - and as a result
increasingly organized --- working class, which was therefore
increasingly conscious. The contradiction between the conditions of life
in which it was exploited and crushed, and the need to build a new
world, would be settled by a kind of almost spontaneous dynamic of
history. But the entire experience of the last century has been that
capital continuously reproduces divisions among the exploited; and that
ideology (the dominant one) also dominates the dominated. [This is not
only because the media manipulate public opinion, even though this is
true and increasingly so, but also because the conditions of domination
of the exploited, including those of an ideological nature, are rooted
in the work relationship itself - given that workers control neither
their instruments of labour nor the goals of production]{.underline}. As
Marx said, workers are appendages of the machine more than they are its
masters. This is why many phenomena in the modern world appear to human
beings as strange and mysterious forces. We are told that we shouldn\'t
do this or that because the markets will get angry, as if the markets
were omnipotent figures, as if money itself were an omnipotent figure,
and so on. [I can\'t get into this now, but it\'s important to say that
capitalist social relations create a world of illusions, a fantasy
world, that the dominated also endure and from which they must free
themselves. This is the reason why spontaneous struggles against
exploitation, oppression and discrimination are necessary. These
struggles are, if you will, fuel for the revolution. But spontaneous
struggles are not enough to break the vicious circle of relations
between capital and labour. There has to be a share of consciousness and
will, a conscious element; and that is the element of political action
and political determination that is borne by a party. A party is not
foreign to the society in which it exists. Even in the most
revolutionary of organizations, you encounter the effects of the
division of labour and of alienation - of alienation from sport, for
example, since that\'s very much in the air this summer - but a
revolutionary organization at least equips itself with the means to
resist collectively and to break the spell and seductive charm of
bourgeois ideology]{.underline}

#### Demanding a blueprint alone will fail---a revolutionary hypothesis is key to form the movements that can generate specific strategies and blueprints that react spontaneously

**Bensaïd 11** (Daniel Bensaïd, July 5th 2011, "Strategy and Party",
translation by Nathan Rao, International Viewpoint,

Accessed 7-14-19, pages 6-7)//sjp

In the 12 minutes that are left, I\'d like to take up two final points.
[First, we are often asked if we have a model for the society we wish to
build. We have no such model. You can\'t say that the emancipation of
workers will be achieved by workers themselves and also claim to be
carrying a blueprint of the future society in your backpack. What we do
have, however, is the memory of a series of experiences of struggles,
revolutions, victories and defeats that we can carry with us, preserve
and pass on to others. What we have isn\'t a model for society but
rather the hypotheses for a revolutionary strategy. In developed
capitalist countries, where wage earners account for a large majority of
the active population, we work with the idea of an insurrectional
general strike. This may appear to some as an idea from the 20th century
or even the 19th, but it doesn\'t mean that revolution will necessarily
take the form of a perfect general strike --- a general strike that has
armed pickets and is insurrectional. But it does mean that our work is
organized in line with this perspective.]{.underline} Through struggles,
local strikes, regional strikes and sectoral strikes, we try to
familiarize workers with the idea of the general strike. [This is
crucial because in crisis situations it\'s what can lead to a
spontaneous mass reaction in that direction]{.underline}. [At the time
of the Pinochet coup d\'état in Chile in September 1973, president
Allende didn\'t call for a general strike even though he could still
broadcast over the radio. Had there been methodical and systematic work
in this direction, there could have been a spontaneous general strike
with factory occupations. This might not have prevented the coup d\'état
but it would certainly have made it much more difficult]{.underline}.
What\'s more, a struggle lost with a fight is always resumed much more
easily than one lost without a fight. That is practically an iron law of
all the experiences of the 20th century. Working with the idea of a
general strike doesn\'t mean calling for one all the time; but it does
mean nurturing the idea so that it almost becomes labour\'s reflexive
response to attacks from employers, in the face of a coup d\'état or
anti-democratic repression. It is difficult to imagine that the July
1936 uprising in Catalonia and Spain against the coup d\'état could have
taken place in the absence of the preparatory work done by the POUM and
the anarchists, without the 1934 experience in Asturias, and so forth.
[To work with the perspective of a general strike doesn\'t mean that you
proclaim it foolishly and abstractly, but rather that you try to seize
upon every experience that in any case creates habits and familiarity,
and develops reflexes, in the working-class movement. Insurrection
isn\'t necessarily the stylized view of it that you see in
Eisenstein\'s - superb --- film about the October insurrection in
Russia. It can take very simple forms such as self-defence on a picket
line; and work in the army and soldiers committees when there was a
conscription army in France and Portugal. It is a matter of disrupting
the bourgeoisie\'s forces of repression.]{.underline} These are unifying
threads that enable us to make the link between daily struggles, however
modest, and our ultimate objective. These days many comrades in Italy,
France and elsewhere too, I think, have been focusing on the need to
build organizations that are independent of the parties of
social-liberalism, Social Democracy and so forth. B[ut why do we want
independent organizations? It\'s because we have a different goal and
because we have an idea of where we want to go. We know that --- while
it may win us some small reforms --- participating alongside Social
Democrats in a bourgeois government takes us further from our goal
rather than bringing us closer to it, because it increases confusion and
doesn\'t create clarity]{.underline}. Of course, if we don\'t concern
ourselves with the matter of an ultimate goal and with that of having,
not a definitive answer, but at least some idea of how we plan on
getting there, then we will be sent reeling by the simplest tactical
challenge, by the slightest electoral disappointment, by the mildest
setback, and so on. [You need clear ideas to build something that will
last into the long term. In all likelihood, revolution will catch us by
surprise. Future revolutions will never be a simple repetition of past
revolutions, for the basic reason that societies are no longer the same.
I often say that our situation is like the one familiar to armies, who
are trained in military colleges on the basis of past battles. But new
battles are never the same and that\'s why people say that armies are
always one war behind]{.underline}. And we always run the risk of being
one revolution behind. Even the most revolutionary among us are taken by
surprise. Despite their reputation, for example, the Bolsheviks were
split at the time of the October insurrection. [No revolutionary
organization is a monolithic party of steel. The ultimate test will come
when the opportunity for revolution presents itself.]{.underline}

#### **A revolutionary pedagogy is key to overthrow capitalism---the educational space is key to develop it**

**Malott 12** (Curry Malott, "Rethinking Educational Purpose: The
Socialist Challenge", West Chester University of Pennsylvania,
<http://jceps.com/wp-content/uploads/PDFs/10-2-05.pdf>, Accessed
7-13-19)//sjp

If equality cannot be achieved within not only the United States, but
within the global capitalist system in general, then why do radicals
continue to advocate for education as fundamentally important? Even as
far back as Marx he acknowledged that education can play a fundamental
role in challenging capitalism by teaching students how to develop their
critical reasoning skills and class consciousness. Bowles and Gintis
(1976) contextualize and summarize this revolutionary approach to
education in the following passage: [...Movements for educational reform
have faltered through refusing to call into question the basic structure
of property and power in economic life]{.underline}...[We believe that
the key to reform is the democratization of economic relationships:
social ownership, democratic and participatory control of the production
process by workers, equal sharing of socially necessary labor by all,
and progressive equalization of incomes and destruction of hierarchical
economic relationships. This is, of course, socialism...In this
conception, education strategy is part of a revolutionary transformation
of economic life...We must press for an educational environment in which
youth can develop the capacity and commitment collectively to control
their lives and regulate their social interactions with a sense of
equality, reciprocity, and communality.]{.underline} Not that such an
environment will of itself alter the quality of social life. Rather,
that it will nurture a new generation of workers...unwilling to submit
to the fragmented relationships of dominance and subordinacy prevailing
in economic life. (p. 14) Advancing the conceptualizations outlined here
by Bowles and Gintis (1976), Peter McLaren and Ramin Farahmandpur
(2005), argue that a socialist pedagogy takes as its starting point a
consciousness of the role that education plays in reproducing the
capitalist relations of production. [This revolutionary pedagogy takes
as its ultimate goal the socialist reconfiguration of capitalist society
taking special care to avoid past mistakes, such as any element of
Stalinist authoritarianism, prescriptions or attacks on freedom (McLaren
& Farahmandpur, 2005). An education for a socialist future offers
students and workers "opportunities to develop critical social skills
that will assist them in gaining an awareness of---and a resolve to
transform---the exploitative nature of capitalist social and economic
relations of production]{.underline}" (McLaren & Farahmandpur, 2005, p.
53). In a number of recent public addresses internationally renowned
Marxist geographer David Harvey argues that because of the impoverished
conditions of a growing number of the earths' population and thus the
lack of political power, the vast majority are increasingly finding they
have to take these skills to the streets. McLaren and Farahmandpur
(2005) keenly observe that such complex connections are best taught to
students using the concept of relation. [Why? It helps students and
workers become class conscious (as a class for itself). It helps
students understand that everyone who relies on a wage to survive has a
common class interest with all workers globally helping understand
nationalism as an ideological tool (as well as a source of ruling class
military and judicial power).]{.underline} The concept of relation helps
make connections between the past and the present informing analysis and
tactics targeting the true cause of conflict between labor and capital.
Again, democratic socialism is not "a prescription for socialism, but
one based on mutuality, dialogical reciprocity, humility, and
self-respect" (McLaren & Farahmandpur, p. 56). [Offering some of the
deepest insights on enacting our socialist pedagogy (both currently and
historically) come from anarchist pedagogies]{.underline}. For example,
Robert Haworth (2012) in his Introduction to Anarchist Pedagogies:
Collective Actions, Theories, and Critical Reflection on Education notes
that "over the last century, anarchists have made numerous attempts to
create educational processes that transgress authoritative factory
models and deterministic curriculum of the state and corporate entities"
(p. 2). While I value the horizontal, radically democratic
anticapitalist anarchist pedagogies celebrated in Haworth's (2012)
Anarchist Pedagogies, a volume I myself, an international Marxist,
contributed to, I do not agree with some anarchists and autonomous
Marxists who argue that capitalism is undergoing a shift from a material
to an immaterial knowledge economy (industrial output has continued to
expand within the globally integrated system of capitalist production)
or that the on-going development of capitalism has fundamentally
transformed the basic nature of accumulation and the relationship
between the buyers and sellers of labor power. [Pedagogically, however,
Anarchist Pedagogies (Haworth, 2012) includes fundamentally important
essays on free schools and workers' colleges as well as pedagogical
explorations surrounding more recent manifestations such as street
medics. Situated in a slightly larger context we might observe that in
the religiously anti-socialist/Marxist/communist atmosphere of the
United States in particular, anarchist activists, revolutionaries, and
pedagogues have been most visible in the anticapitalist movements from
the anti-globalization Seattle demonstrations of 1999 to the more recent
Occupy Wall Street phenomenon.]{.underline} [At the end of the day it
seems reasonable to observe that there is a whole range of theoretical
and practical issues Marxist and anarchist critical pedagogues must
collectively find the humility to engage each other in order to move the
anti-capitalist movement in education forward. This endeavor is well
beyond the scope of this short essay, but it is a topic that needs more
attention. In conclusion, regardless of what form consciousness raising
takes, a revolutionary ideology must be adopted. As Lenin (1902/1975)
reminded us, without revolutionary theory there can be no revolution
(although I have more confidence in the working class' ability to
develop an independent ideology and revolutionary program than Lenin
did)]{.underline}. Situated in the context of the current global
anti-capitalist movement in "embryo" (an embryo perhaps more developed
in Greece than anywhere else in Europe at the present moment), the
international occupy movement and the \"Arab Spring\" can be
characterized by what Lenin (1902/1975) called \"spontaneous\" uprisings
and thus the "embryo" of an anti-capitalist movement. What we venture to
do to see this embryo reach a healthy, revolutionary maturity remains
the core of this socialist challenge and our collective, unwritten
future.

[The clock is ticking, and revolutionary [socialists must]{.mark} use
this calm before the storm to [study revolutionary theory, strategy,
tactics, and history. We must participate in the day-to-day struggles of
our class]{.mark} and sink roots in every workplace, campus, and working
class neighborhood. [History]{.mark} does not repeat precisely, but
there are [lessons to be learned and patterns to
discern]{.mark}.]{.underline} The mighty sacrifices and many martyrs of
our class have not been in vain. [[The]{.mark} task of the [present
generation is to]{.mark} make workers' [democracy a reality at long
last]{.mark}. We must unleash the vast potential constrained by the
profit motive and nation state if we are [to save our species]{.mark}
from climate change [and]{.mark} lay the foundations for [endi]{.mark}ng
the [endemic war, terrorism, racism,]{.mark} and misery of class
society.]{.underline} The balance of forces is overwhelmingly in our
favor. For example, counterprotesters dwarfed a recent rally by the KKK
in Virginia. But we cannot take this for granted. [If we do not build a
leadership worthy of the challenges history has in store for us, things
can turn into their opposite.]{.underline} Defeats without a fight can
be more disorienting and demoralizing than giving your all and falling
short. There is no better occasion than the centenary of the Russian
Revolution to redouble our efforts for the cause of socialism. Far from
being ashamed of our revolutionary credentials, we are proud to stand on
the shoulders of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, and the countless other
revolutionary heroes of our class from around the world. We repudiate
those who equate Leninism with the anti-working class ideas and methods
of Stalinism. We embrace the legacy of Bolshevism and reject those who
caricature its accomplishments and organizational forms. Hesitation,
routinism, bureaucratism, and indecision can be fatal in a revolutionary
situation[. This is why [a revolutionary party requires]{.mark} a
[clear]{.mark} program and [structures that maximize democracy,
accountability, professionalism, and efficiency]{.mark} in action. Open,
democra[t]{.mark}ic debate, maj[o]{.mark}rity-rules decision-making, and
unity in action are the only way we can [defeat the centralized
power]{.mark} of our class enemy.]{.underline} Revolutionary discipline
cannot be imposed but must be voluntary and based on genuine conviction
and commitment. Now is no time for skepticism or vacillation. A perfect
storm is forming, and a decisive historical convergence is on the
horizon. In the epoch that opens before us, each of us will be called
upon to answer: Which side are you on? The very future of humanity is at
stake. Fortunately, the historical process will do the heavy lifting for
us---but we need your help to tip the balance and give the system the
final push over the edge. Join the IMT and fight for socialist
revolution!

#### Debate is Key to Develop Effective Strategies of Revolution 

John **Riddell and** Mike **Taber,** **No Date**, Riddell is a socialist
historian and editor. \"A school of revolutionary strategy,\" No
Publication, https://isreview.org/issue/99/school-revolutionary-strategy

Shortly after the conclusion of the Communist International's Third
Congress, Leon Trotsky termed the 1921 gathering a "school of
revolutionary strategy."1To the Masses: Proceedings of the Third
Congress of the Communist International---to be published in paperback
by Haymarket Books in February 2016---shows the accuracy of Trotsky's
assessment. [[Strategic demands have a]{.mark} long [history within
the]{.mark} revolutionary [workers movement.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
basic Marxist approach was first presented in the Communist Manifesto,
which outlined revolutionary measures that communists were putting
forward on the eve of the revolutions of 1848. Marx and Engels returned
to this perspective in later years, as well.2 In the decades surrounding
the dawn of the twentieth century, world capitalism was in full
ascendancy. Within the socialist movement during these years, prospects
for revolution seemed remote to many. In this context a gap developed
between the declared goals of the socialist movement---the taking of
political power by the proletariat---and the strategy and tactics needed
to get there.3 This gap eventually widened to the point that, with the
onset of World War I, a definitive split took place between
revolutionary and opportunist forces, as the Second International's
leadership rejected revolutionary change even as a far-off goal. During
the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks helped revive the Marxist
tradition on this question, exemplified by Lenin's "The Impending
Catastrophe and How to Combat It."4 [That document set forth a number of
transitional demands in the situation facing the working class of Russia
on the eve of the October Revolution. Following the Russian
revolutionary victory and the end of World War I, a [powerful
revolutionary wave swept over]{.mark} Europe and much of [the
world.]{.mark} The force of this wave was such that in two
places---Hungary and Bavaria---[the working class was]{.mark} briefly
[swept into power without]{.mark} the communist forces [having a clear
conception of]{.mark} how they got there or [what they should be
doing]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the midst of this upsurge, the Communist
International held its foundation congress in Moscow in March 1919,
raising the banner of the worldwide fight for soviet power. [A year
later, the Comintern's Second Congress set forth the new International's
basic program and outlined the type of party the working class
needed]{.underline}. At the time, prospects still appeared bright for
imminent revolutionary victory. Within months after the Second Congress,
however, it became clear that the revolutionary wave was receding. [[No
longer]{.mark} would it be [possible for]{.mark} any [communist
to]{.mark} realistically conceive of the working class [win]{.mark}ning
power [without a strategic vision and tactical knowhow]{.mark}. For that
reason this question of strategy was at the center of the Communist
International's Third Congress in mid-1921. As Leon Trotsky explained
shortly after the gathering ended: [The art of]{.mark} tactics and
[strategy]{.mark}, the art of revolutionary struggle [can be mastered
only through experience]{.mark}, through [criticism and
self-criticism]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the Third World Congress we told
the young Communists: "Comrades, we desire not only heroic struggle, we
desire first of all victory.... Of course, every struggle does not lead
to victory. Defeats are inescapable. But these defeats must not come
through the fault of our party. [Yet we have seen [many]{.mark}
manifestations and [methods of struggle]{.mark}, which [do not]{.mark}
and cannot [lead to victory,]{.mark} [for they are dictated]{.mark} time
and time again [by]{.mark} revolutionary [impatience and no]{.mark}t by
[political sagacity]{.mark}.]{.underline}5 [[At the Third Congress, the
question of strategy and tactics was sharply posed]{.mark} by several
events in the class struggle in Europe. One of the most significant was
[the March Action in Germany]{.mark}---an attempt by Communists there to
turn a defensive proletarian battle into a general strike and
revolutionary uprising through the determined efforts of a working-class
minority. The adventure [failed and the]{.mark} German proletariat and
[communist movement suffered a major defeat]{.mark}. What was especially
dangerous for the communist movement internationally was the effort by
the March Action's supporters to generalize that experience into a
"theory of the revolutionary offensive." The heart of this conception
was the belief that a dedicated minority, through its own initiatives,
could spark the working class into revolutionary action. [At the
congress Lenin and Trotsky led a fight against this theory and]{.mark}
the assumptions underlying it, [eventually winning the congress over to
their view]{.mark}. In the process, the Third Congress was compelled to
grapple with the question of strategy and the transitional method,
making a lasting contribution to revolutionary socialist
practice.]{.underline} The full record of this discussion and the
resolutions coming out of it can be found in the recently published
edition of the congress proceedings. Excerpts from "Resolution on
Tactics and Strategy," and the report to the congress on it by Karl
Radek appear below.6 The question of transitional strategy and demands
was also taken up and expanded upon at the Comintern's Fourth Congress
in November 1922.7 But at the Fifth Congress in 1924---the congress
marking the beginning of the Comintern's degeneration and
Stalinization---the perspective of transitional strategy was largely
abandoned.8 [Subsequently, the strategic contributions of the early
Comintern were upheld and defended by the International Left Opposition
and Fourth International, codified in the Transitional Program drafted
by Trotsky in 1938.]{.underline}9 Mike Taber and John Riddell From
"Resolution on Tactics and Strategy" The Communist parties can develop
only through struggle. [Even the smallest [Communist parties cannot
limit themselves to]{.mark} mere [propaganda]{.mark} and agitation. [In
all]{.mark} the proletariat's [mass organizations they must be a
vanguard]{.mark} that, by pressing for struggle for all the
proletariat's vital necessities, demonstrates how the struggle should be
carried out, thus exposing the traitorous character of the non-Communist
parties. Only if the Communists are able to take the lead in and promote
all the proletariat's practical struggles will they be able to actually
win broad masses of the proletariat for a struggle for its dictatorship.
All the Communist parties' agitation and propaganda, indeed all their
work, must be imbued with the consciousness that no enduring improvement
in the conditions of the masses is possible in a capitalist
framework]{.underline}. Steps to improve working-class conditions and to
reconstruct an economy devastated by capitalism can be taken only by
overthrowing the bourgeoisie and smashing the capitalist state. But this
insight must not lead to any postponement of the struggle for the
proletariat's immediate and urgent necessities of life until the time
when it is capable of erecting its dictatorship. The present period is
one of capitalist decay and collapse, a time when capitalism is no
longer capable of assuring workers of even the life of a well-fed slave.
The Social Democracy advances the old Social Democratic program of
peaceful reforms, carried out on the basis and in the framework of
bankrupt capitalism, through peaceful means. This is conscious deception
of the working masses. Not only is decaying capitalism incapable of
providing the workers with relatively humane living conditions, but the
Social Democrats and reformists show every day, in every country, that
they do not intend to conduct any type of struggle for even the most
modest reforms contained in their programme. The demand for
socialisation or nationalisation of the most important industries,
advanced by the centrist parties,10 is equally deceptive. The centrists
mislead the masses by seeking to convince them that all the most
important branches of industry can be torn out of the grip of capitalism
without the defeat of the bourgeoisie. Moreover, they seek to divert the
workers from the real, living struggle for their immediate needs through
hope that branches of industry can be taken over, one after another,
ultimately creating the basis for "planned" economic construction. In
this fashion, they go back to the Social Democratic minimum program for
reforming capitalism, which has been transformed into an obvious
counterrevolutionary fraud. Some of the centrists advance a program to
nationalise the coal industry, for example, in part as an expression of
\[Ferdinand\] Lassalle's concept that all the proletariat's energies
should be focused on a single demand, in order to convert it into a
lever for revolutionary action, whose progress would lead to a struggle
for power. What we have here is empty schematism. The working class in
all the capitalist states suffers today from so many and such terrible
scourges that it is impossible to concentrate the struggle against all
these oppressive burdens that weigh it down by focusing on some formula
dreamed up in doctrinaire fashion. The task, by contrast, is to take all
the masses' interests as the starting point for revolutionary struggles
that only in their unity form the mighty river of revolution. The
Communist parties do not propose a minimum programme for these
struggles, one designed to reinforce and improve the rickety structure
of capitalism. Instead, destruction of this structure remains their
guiding goal and their immediate task. But to achieve this task, the
Communist parties have to advance demands whose achievement meets an
immediate, urgent need of the working class, and fight for these demands
regardless of whether they are compatible with the capitalist profit
system. Communist parties direct their concern not to the viability and
competiveness of capitalist industry or the resilience of capitalist
finance but to the dimensions of a deprivation that the proletariat
cannot bear and should not have to bear. Demands should express the
needs experienced by broad proletarian masses, such that they are
convinced they cannot survive unless these demands are achieved. If that
is the case, the struggles for these demands will become starting points
for the struggle for power. In place of the minimum program of the
centrists and reformists, the Communist International offers a struggle
for the specific demands of the proletariat, as part of a system of
demands that, in their totality, undermine the power of the bourgeoisie,
organize the proletariat, and mark out the different stages of the
struggle for proletarian dictatorship. Each of these demands gives
expression to the needs of the broad masses, even when they do not yet
consciously take a stand for proletarian dictatorship. The struggle for
these demands to meet the masses' essentials of life needs to embrace
and mobilise broader and broader numbers. It must be counterposed to
defence of the essentials of life for capitalist society. To the extent
that this is done, the working class will become aware that for it to
live, capitalism must die. This awareness provides the basis for a
determination to struggle for \[proletarian\] dictatorship. Communist
parties have the task of broadening, deepening, and unifying the
struggles that develop around such specific demands. Every partial
action undertaken by the working masses in order to achieve a partial
demand, every significant economic strike, also mobilises the entire
bourgeoisie, which comes down as a class on the side of the threatened
group of employers, aiming to render impossible even a limited victory
by the proletariat ("Emergency Technical Assistance,"11 bourgeois
strikebreakers in the British railway workers' strike, Fascists). The
bourgeoisie mobilises the entire state apparatus for the struggle
against the workers (militarisation of the workers in France and Poland,
state of emergency during the miners' strike in Britain). The workers
who are struggling for partial demands will be automatically forced into
a struggle against the bourgeoisie as a whole and its state apparatus.
To the extent that struggles for partial demands and partial struggles
by specific groups of workers broaden into an overall working-class
struggle against capitalism, the Communist Party must escalate its
slogans and generalise them to the point of calling for the enemy's
immediate overthrow. In advancing such partial demands, the Communist
parties must take care that these slogans, anchored in the needs of the
broad masses, do not merely lead them into struggle but are also
inherently demands that organise the masses. [[All]{.mark} specific
[slogans]{.mark} that arise [from the econ]{.mark}omic [needs of the
working masses must be steered toward a struggle for control of
production]{.mark}---not as a scheme for bureaucratic organisation of
the economy under capitalism, but as a struggle against capitalism
through factory councils and revolutionary trade unions.]{.underline}
Building such organisations and linking them according to branches and
centers of industry is the only way to organisationally unify the
struggle of the working masses and resist the splitting of the masses by
Social Democracy and the trade-union leaders. [[The factory councils can
carry out these tasks only if they arise from struggle for
econ]{.mark}omic [goals]{.mark} shared by the broadest masses of
workers, only if they create links among all revolutionary sectors of
the proletariat---between the Communist parties, the revolutionary
workers, and the trade unions that are evolving in a revolutionary
direction]{.underline}.

Petrified Futurity [[Capitalist Realism indexes]{.mark} not only our

political resignation which denies the possibility for any other
socio-economic structural scenario.]{.mark} This \'atmosphere\'
permeates both conscious and unconscious life]{.underline}, including
the arena of cultural production (music, art, film, etc.) where instead
of seeing boundless innovation (a capitalist premise), we seem caught in
retroparalysis: loops of re-makes and pop-cultural revivalism,5 where
substantial technological development devolves into trivial consumer
gadgetry.\' [Within such an atmosphere, mental distress]{.underline} and
illness [has also proliferated as a debilitating symp- tom of the
behavioral imperatives this naturalization entails. This is in the way
[one is compelled to \'govern from within\' to adapt to the world
successfully in]{.mark} full, entrepre- neurial [self-reliance. Such
naturalization is internalized]{.mark} as the only system compat- ible
with \'innate\' humanness, where this picture of \'innateness\' is both
self-referential and self-reinforcing, [coercing the human into a narrow
mold **wherein the incentive of accumulation**]{.mark} **through
competition [is isomorphic with our \'intrinsic\' selfishness]{.mark}
and self-interest**]{.underline} (those very social biases buttressing
neoclassical economics, upon which neoliberalism is built). In this
framing, [[capitalism is upheld as the only system com- mensurate with
the \'nature\' of the human]{.mark}; to suggest otherwise is to fall
prey to folly]{.underline}, almost as nonsensical as fighting the fact
of gravity on earth. The diagnosis Fisher puts forth, quite pointedly,
is that **[[Capitalist Realism petrifies politics because it stifles our

[The]{.underline} United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP launched
[the]{.mark} concept of [green economy]{.mark} in 2008.]{.underline} The
green economy model aims at promoting human well-being and social
equality as well as at reducing environmental risks. Its goal is a
low-carbon, resource-efficient and socially inclusive economy.39 [The
new model of growth]{.underline} proposed by the UNEP [[was
expected]{.mark} to bring important changes. It was hoped to [solve
the]{.mark} global [recession and ecological
crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline} The green economy has given rise to various
interpretations. Different attributes are often attached to it, such as
an inclusive green economy that promotes employment, which is, for
example, one of the priorities in Finland\'s Development Policy
Programme.40 Civil society activists and researchers have also defined
their ideal visions of the green economy.41 [The green economy is based
on the concept of ecological modernisation. It believes in solving
environmental issues without significant changes to the current course
of modern life and economic system through increasing
efficiency.]{.underline} Environmental and climate [problems are solved
in a growthbased market economy, while sustainability is guaranteed by
means of efficient institutions and green technology.]{.underline}42 The
Financialisation of Nature [**[The green economy is criticised for its
excessive growth orientation]{.mark}** and insufficient efforts towards
social justice. [The UNEP]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[suggested]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[decoupling]{.mark} of natural
resources and environmental damage [would provide]{.mark} conditions for
[a sustainable]{.mark} economic [model. At the same time, it recognises
that]{.mark} **so far [we have not succeeded]{.mark} in implementing
absolute decoupling**]{.underline} (see page 6 on decoupling). [The
[**monetary valuation of nature** also **divides opinion**]{.mark}**.**
The UNEP states that this is a means for protecting nature. Different
[calculation mechanisms are]{.mark} being [devised for defining
a]{.mark} market [value ]{.mark}]{.underline}[f]{.mark}or environmental
services, i.e. [[for]{.mark} the [benefits ecosystems offer]{.mark} to
[humans.]{.mark}]{.underline} For forests it can be calculated using the
timber market price or carbon sequestration capacity. Biodiversity banks
can be used for compensating for the loss of biodiversity. For example,
a wetlands habitat cleared for an infrastructure project can be
compensated for by producing a similar habitat in another place. After
basic commodities, such as food and land, have been priced, they can be
traded as derivatives in the financial markets. In the European Union
Emissions Trading System, trading takes place with calculated emission
values. [A lot of criticism has been expressed against such systems.
[**Cost-benefit models have been found to be socially inequitable**
since]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[market logics gives priority to the

[[rights to resources will be transferred]{.mark} over time [from the

**Environmental commoditization means placing emphasis on market
mechanisms instead of public regulation.**]{.underline}44 Some large
Western environmental organisations, such as the IUCN and the WWF, see
potential in the green economy and look for points in common between it
and their own objectives, while [many [organisations from the Global
South are]{.mark}]{.underline} [often]{.mark} more [[critical
about]{.mark} the [pricing]{.mark} of [nature.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
international community and well-financed international NGOs have been
in the forefront of advocating the green economy for poor countries.45
Companies also have a key position in the green economic system. Green
technology companies can be strengthened by committing them to the
objectives of green economy. Some of these companies have promoted the
adoption of stricter emission standards to their own advantage. However,
**[[the]{.mark} overall success of the actors promoting the [green
economy has been weak in challenging]{.mark} the development model based

[In what follows, I will argue that Herman Daly, Tim Jackson, Andrew
Simms -- and the rest of the anti-growth school of ecological economists
-- are right: that we need a new macro-economic model that allows us to
thrive without endless consumption]{.underline}. But they are wrong to
think that this can be a capitalist economic model. [I will try to show
why ecologically suicidal growth is built into the nature of any
conceivable capitalism. This means, I contend, that the project of a
steady-state capitalism is impossible and a distraction from what I
think ought to the highest priority for ecological economists today --
which is to develop a broad conversation about what the lineaments of a
post-capitalist ecological economy could look like]{.underline}. I'm
going to start by stating three theses which I take to be fundamental
principles and rules for reproduction that define any capitalism, and
shape the dynamics of capitalist economic development: 1. Producers are
dependent upon the market: Capitalism is a mode of production in which
specialized producers (corporations, companies, manufacturers,
individual producers) produce some commodity for market but do not
produce their own means of subsistence. Workers own no means of
production, or insufficient means to enter into production on their own,
and so have no choice but to sell their labor to the capitalists.
Capitalists as a class possess a monopoly ownership of most of society's
means of production but do not directly produce their own means of
subsistence. [So capitalists have to sell their commodities on the
market to obtain money to buy their own means of subsistence and to
purchase new means of production and hire more labor, to re-enter
production and carry on from year to year]{.underline}. [So in a
capitalist economy, everyone is dependent upon the market, compelled to
sell in order to buy, to buy in order to sell to re-enter production and
carry on.]{.underline} [2. Competition is the motor of economic
development: When producers come to market they're not free to sell
their particular commodity at whatever price they wish because they find
other producers selling the same commodity. They therefore have to "meet
or beat" the competition to sell their product and stay in business.
Competition thus forces producers to reinvest much of their profit back
into productivity-enhancing technologies and processes (instead of
spending it on conspicuous consumption or warfare without developing the
forces of production as ruling classes did, for example, under
feudalism). Producers must constantly strive to increase the efficiency
of their units of production by cutting the cost of inputs, seeking
cheaper sources of raw materials and labor, by bringing in more advanced
labor-saving machinery and technology to boost productivity, or by
increasing their scale of production to take advantage of economies of
scale, and in other ways, to develop the forces of
production.]{.underline} 3. ["Grow or die" is a law of survival in the
marketplace: In the capitalist mode of production, most producers (there
are some exceptions, which I will note below) have no choice but to live
by the capitalist maxim "grow or die".]{.underline} First, as Adam Smith
noted, the ever-increasing division of labor raises productivity and
output, compelling producers to find more markets for this growing
output. Secondly, competition compels producers to seek to expand their
market share, to defend their position against competitors. Bigger is
safer because, ceteris paribus, bigger producers can take advantage of
economies of scale and can use their greater resources to invest in
technological development, so can more effectively dominate markets.
Marginal competitors tend to be crushed or bought out by larger firms
(Chrysler, Volvo, etc.). Thirdly, the modern corporate form of ownership
adds irresistible and unrelenting pressures to grow from owners
(shareholders). Corporate CEOs do not have the freedom to choose not to
grow or to subordinate profitmaking to ecological concerns because they
don't own their firms even if they own substantial shares[. Corporations
are owned by masses of shareholders. And the shareholders are not
looking for "stasis"; they are looking to maximize portfolio gains, so
they drive their CEOs forward. In short, I maintain that the growth
imperative is virtually a law of nature built-into in any conceivable
capitalism. Corporations have no choice but to seek to
grow]{.underline}. It is not "subjective". It is not just an "obsession"
or a "spell". And it cannot be exorcised. Further, I maintain that these
theses are uncontroversial, even completely obvious to mainstream
economists across the ideological spectrum from Milton Friedman to Paul
Krugman. [But Herman Daly, Tim Jackson and the rest of the promarket
anti-growth school of ecological economists must deny these elementary
capitalist rules for reproduction because their project for a
"steady-state" ecocapitalism rests on the assumption that capitalist
economic fundamentals are not immutable, that growth is "optional", and
thus dispensable.]{.underline}

[So scientists are telling us that to save the humans we need to
virtually shut down the coal industry, drastically reduce production of
fossil fuels and phase out many toxic chemicals as quickly as
possible.37 But, how can we do this under capitalism? Peabody Coal,
Chevron Oil, Monsanto -- these are huge companies which have sunk all
their capital and trained thousands of skilled personnel to produce what
they produce. How could they just write all that off and start over? How
could they accept quotas that would force them to drastically reduce
production, depress profits, or even close down -- and be responsible to
their shareholders? As Milton Friedman said, "corporations are in
business to make money, not save the world." Yet if corporations carry
on with business as usual we're doomed. So what to do?]{.underline}
Lineaments of an ecological economy If we're going to save the world, I
would suggest that humanity is going to have to begin that "broad
discussion" Theo Colborn proposed, with people across the whole of
society and around the world to figure out how to redesign the economy.
This could be the starting point of an eco-socialist economic democracy.
For my part, I would suggest that an agenda for that discussion ought to
include at least the following points: (1) [We're going to have to find
ways to put the brakes on out-of-control growth, even if it means
drastically retrenching or shutting down coal companies, oil companies,
chemical companies, auto companies, even whole economic sectors
dedicated 100% to waste production like the disposable products
industries]{.underline}. (2) We're going to have to radically
restructure production by imposing sharp limits and to physically ration
the use and consumption of all sorts of specific resources like coal,
oil, gas, lumber, fish, oil, water, minerals, toxic chemicals and many
products made from them. Some products, like coal-fired power plants,
toxic pesticides, diesel fuel, bottled water and junk food should
probably be phased out and banned altogether. (3) We're going to have to
sharply increase investments in things society does need, like renewable
energy, organic farming, public transport, public water systems, public
health, quality schools for our children and many other currently
underfunded social and environmental needs. (4) We're going to have to
do away with production that is geared to mindless consumerism and
needless repetitive consumption and the industries that support them.
Too many choices and too short a lifespan for products have socially and
environmentally unbearable costs. We live on a small planet with limited
resources. Others need those resources too, so we can't afford waste.
(5) We're going to have to devise a rational approach to waste --
meaning to minimize all waste: forbid the disposal of toxics of any
sort, eliminate most (if not all) single-use products like disposable
containers, wrappings, diapers, pens, cameras, etc., eliminate throwaway
containers, enforce mandatory and systematic reuse of containers,
packaging, recycling, composting, etc. (6) And, if we have to shut down
polluting or wasteful industries then society is going to have to
provide equivalent jobs, not just retraining or the unemployment line,
for those all those displaced workers because, if we don't, there will
be no social support for the drastic changes we need to make to ensure
our survival. [Of course, the minute we start talking about shutting
down the coal industry or pesticide producers, or forcing them to
change, and "directing" resources into new industries, then we're
talking about violating capitalists' "freedom" to produce and sell
whatever they like, and consumer "free choice" to buy whatever we want
and can afford. We would be screwing up the market. That's right. But
that is exactly what we have to do because the rational efficient market
is very efficiently liquidating every resource on the planet and wiping
us out in the process. If we want to save ourselves and many other
species, then we have to give up the freedom of capitalists to produce
and sell as they please and consumers to buy whatever they like and can
afford -- in order to win the greater freedom for humanity to breathe
clean air, to have safe water to drink, to have safe food to eat, to
live long and healthy lives free of toxics-induced diseases, to restore
a forested, clean, safe, habitable planet we can pass on to our
children. Such a democratic and ecological economy would of course be
completely incompatible with capitalist property and capitalist
organization of production. It would in fact require large-scale
democratic planning of the entire economy.]{.underline}

Paul Hawken was right. We need a "restorative economy", an economy that
lives within nature's limits, that minimizes and even eliminates waste
from production, and so on. But he was completely wrong to imagine that
we could ever get this under capitalism. In what follows I am going to
explain why this is so and in conclusion state what I think are the
implications of this critique. To start with, I'm going to state five
theses about green capitalism and then develop these arguments in the
rest of this essay. [1. Capitalism and saving the planet are
fundamentally and irreconcilably at odds. It is not just "bad business
practices". Profit seeking cannot be systematically "aligned" with
environmental goals, much less subordinated, because any corporate CEO
who attempts to do so (and we shall consider the fate of some who tried)
will shortly find himself in hot water with his bosses, the
shareholders, or if he were to persist, his company would be driven out
of the market and/or abandoned by its shareholders]{.underline}. I argue
therefore, that the only way to systematically align production with
society's needs is to do so directly, in a democratically planned
economy. 2. [No capitalist government on Earth can impose "green taxes"
that would drive the coal industry -- or any other industry -- out of
business, or even force major retrenchments by suppressing production
because, among other important reasons, given capitalism, this would
just provoke recession and mass unemployment, if not worse. This means
the carbon tax strategy to stop global warming is a
non-starter]{.underline}. Since profit seeking and environmental goals
are systematically opposed, without green taxes, the entire green
capitalist project collapses 3. [Green capitalism enthusiasts vastly
underestimate the gravity, scope and speed of the global ecological
collapse we face and thus unrealistically imagine that growth can
continue forever if we just tweak the incentives and penalties a bit
here and there with green taxes and such. I claim that the capitalist
market system is inherently eco-suicidal, that endless growth can only
end in catastrophic eco-collapse, that no amount of tinkering can alter
the market system's suicidal trajectory, and that, therefore, like it or
not, humanity has no choice but to try to find a way to replace
capitalism with some kind of post-capitalist ecologically sustainable
economy.]{.underline} 4[. Green capitalism theorists grossly
overestimate the potential of "clean" "green" production and
"dematerializing", the economy whereas, in reality, much if not most of
the economy -- from resource extraction like mining and drilling, to
metals smelting and chemicals production, to most manufacturing --
cannot be greened in any meaningful sense at all. This means that if we
really want to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the 80%
that scientists say we need to do to save the humans, then we have no
choice but to enforce a drastic contraction of production in the
industrialized countries, especially in the most polluting and wasteful
sectors. Most industries will have to be sharply retrenched. Some, the
very worst polluting and wasteful, will have to be virtually closed down
entirely.]{.underline} Since the scale of the cuts we need to make to
save the humans would mean mass unemployment under capitalism, I contend
that the only way to address this problem is to construct a bottom-up
socialist economic democracy that can guarantee employment to those made
redundant by retraction and closures. Further, the need for sharp
cutbacks in production will mean less work overall, therefore the
necessity of sharing what work there is among all workers, therefore a
shortening of the working day, a sharing economy, all of which will be
necessary to save the humans but none of which are compatible with
capitalism. 5. Consumerism and overconsumption are not "dispensable" and
cannot be exorcised because they're not just "cultural" or "habitual".
They are built into capitalism and indispensable for the day-to-day
reproduction of corporate producers in a competitive market system in
which capitalists, workers, consumers and governments alike are all
dependent upon an endless cycle of perpetually increasing consumption to
maintain profits, jobs, and tax revenues. [We can't shop our way to
sustainability because the problems we face cannot be solved by
individual choices in the marketplace because, among other reasons, the
global ecological crisis we face cannot be solved by even the largest
individual companies, especially because many of these companies will
have to be shut down altogether, and furthermore, many problems such as
global warming, overfishing, ocean chemistry, are beyond the scope of
nation states]{.underline}. They require collective bottom-up,
democratic control over the entire world economy; they require national
and international economic planning, national and global redistributions
of wealth to maximize popular support for necessary changes, and global
economic coordination to prioritize the needs of humanity, other life
forms, and the environment.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s landmark
[Oc[to]{.mark}ber]{.underline} 2018 report declared that
[[prevent]{.mark}ing runaway [global warming]{.mark}]{.underline} will
require "far-reaching transitions in energy, land ... and industrial
systems" for which there is "no documented historic precedent." Oxford
University climate scientist and report author Myles Allen explained,
"It's telling us we need to ... turn the world economy on a dime." [To
make this turn happen, [we need a]{.mark} carefully [planned]{.mark} and
democratically administered emergency [program for ecological
reconstruction. But]{.mark} such [a program is not]{.mark} remotely
[reconcilable with cap]{.mark}italism's [imperatives of]{.mark} profit
maximization and [growth]{.mark}, not to mention [private ownership of
the means of production]{.mark}. In other words: We need system change
to beat climate change. [Under cap]{.mark}italism, [economies must grow
at a minimum]{.mark} compound rate [of 3 percent]{.mark} to remain
healthy. "[Any slowdown]{.mark} or blockage in capital flow [will
produce a crisis,]{.mark}" wrote Marxist geographer David Harvey in a
2010 paper.]{.underline} "If our blood flow stops, then we die. If
capital flow stops, then the body politic of capitalist society dies."
This generally means a slowdown in investment, falling wages and
widespread unemployment. But given our finite planetary resource base,
this incessant growth is killing us. A recent review of hundreds of
scientific studies showcases the direct link over the last half-century
(during the so-called Great Acceleration) between economic growth,
energy use and carbon emissions. While the original New Deal helped spur
this uptick, the Green New Deal must wind it down. Some sectors of the
economy require immediate contraction. [According to the think tank
Carbon Tracker, 80 percent of known fossil fuel reserves need to be kept
in the ground if we are to avert temperature rise above 2 degrees
Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). But much of [these reserves are
controlled by]{.mark} fossil fuel [corporations accountable]{.mark} only
[to investors. To maintain their value]{.mark} and market share, [these
companies must continue to]{.mark} extract and [sell these reserves and
discover new reserves]{.mark} to replace them.]{.underline} Contraction
is inimical to growth, so it's "Drill, baby, drill." How can we
dismantle this planet-destroying extractive economy? Free-market
solutions and incentives like carbon taxes have, where implemented,
failed to significantly diminish fossil fuel consumption (part of why
the big oil and gas companies support them). [[A]{.mark} dramatically
[higher carbon tax]{.mark} might work to effectively bankrupt these
corporations, but it [would]{.mark} not give the public any control over
how the closure of these industries takes place, [risk]{.mark}ing [job
loss and econ]{.mark}omic [disruption]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rapid and
equitable decarbonization, then, means putting these corporations under
public control---i.e., nationalizing them, through buying out the
majority of their shares. Writers at The Democracy Collaborative
estimate a price tag of around \$1.15 trillion. This may sound
expensive, but remember: Over the next decade, Trump's tax cuts will
give \$2.3 trillion to the rich. This assault on private property will
no doubt trigger fierce resistance from elites. To overcome this
opposition, we will need a massive, organized anti-capitalist movement.
The phaseout of fossil fuels must be economy-wide, including winding
down, finding alternatives to, and supporting affected workers from
fossil fuel-dependent industries like petrochemicals, agribusiness and
aviation, and much superfluous industrial production---not to mention
the arms industry and the military. [[A campaign]{.mark} against
militarism, and [for a]{.mark} Global [Green New Deal, would require
challenging]{.mark} the intra-state economic and military competition
upon which [capitalism]{.mark} relies. While the net effect will be to
contract production, we must also invest in selective growth in certain
sectors, from renewable energy to organic farming, as well as
low-carbon, socially necessary activities such as education and the
caring professions.]{.underline} This will involve reversing the
neoliberal capitalist dogma that has imposed austerity for decades.

### A2 Sustainable -- General

#### Capitalism is unsustainable and will collapse

**Hutton 18** (Will Hutton writes for the Observer, is principal of

years on, capitalism might not survive the shock of another Lehman"
9/9/18.
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/09/ten-years-after-2008-crisis-another-financial-crash>)
ME.

Ten years ago this weekend, frantic efforts were being made to save one
of the biggest banks in the world. When chancellor Alistair Darling
overruled Barclays' supreme stupidity in considering the takeover of the
stricken Lehman Brothers investment bank -- the extent and complexity of
its debts would have brought down both it and probably the British
banking system -- the die was cast. Lehman collapsed and the shockwaves
are still felt to this day. Suddenly, the proud buccaneers of high
finance were exposed as "sapient nincompoops", as the great economic
commentator Walter Bagehot described the senior executives of Overend,
Gurney & Co in the wake of its collapse 150 years earlier. All the
assumptions made by a generation of free-market economists, conservative
politicians and the financial establishment were shown to be ideological
tosh propagated by today's nincompoops**[. Yes, [markets]{.mark} could
and [did make]{.mark} vast, [earth-shaking mistakes]{.mark}. Yes,
shareholders were so disengaged from the companies in which they
invested they, in effect, allowed ownerless banks to be run to create
gargantuan, dynastic fortunes for their managers, assuming risks on a
scale they did not themselves understand. Yes, [the financial system had
become a complex interrelated network no stronger than its weakest link
-- which was very weak]{.mark}. The bill for all these mistakes would be
picked up by wider society, with perpetrators suffering nothing --
nationalising losses and privatising gain[. The whole effect was to
transmute capitalism into a system of value extraction rather than value
creation]{.mark}, with knock-on effects that depressed wages and
contractualised work into short-term and zero-hour contracts. The
financial system, based in London and New York, had become damnable --
the nightmare of our times]{.underline}**. The cumulative costs of this
have become so large they can scarcely be comprehended. The total cost
across the west of recapitalising bust banks, offering guarantees and
making good disappeared liquidity is estimated at \$14tn. The recession
that followed was the deepest since the 1930s, with the slowest
subsequent recovery. Worse, conservative politicians -- most
successfully in Britain -- succeeded in pinning the blame not on the
architects and operators of modern finance but on the excesses of the
state, the rationale for "austerity". High government spending, alleged
chancellor George Osborne and prime minister David Cameron, had caused
the government budget deficit to balloon. Wrong. Rather, the deficit was
caused by collapsing tax revenues during a monumental recession. The
same nincompoopery that had created modern finance now proclaimed that
the stock of public debt -- despite it being proportionally higher for
most of the previous three centuries and at times of higher interest
rates -- represented an existential threat. In the UK, public spending
per head on services will have fallen by a quarter by 2020 as a result
of the consequent spending cuts -- tax increases could not be
countenanced -- with what remains of Britain's social contract ripped
apart. The distress and disaffection helped to fuel the margin that won
the referendum for Leave. As profound was the rupturing of the Faustian
bargain between finance and society that had defined the 30 years up to
2008. **[The [bankers made their fortunes]{.mark}, but [wider
society]{.mark} was [offered]{.mark} boundless [credit and booming
property prices]{.mark}. Companies did not have to create value through
innovation, investment and export; instead, they could ride the credit
boom. [The result: an overblown, featherbedded service sector delivering
ungrounded productivity growth]{.mark}. Post 2008, the wounded system
has been unable to deliver at the same pace, although it tries. The
illusory productivity has stagnated; and trust in value-extracting
business and capitalism, which continues to displace risk on to the
shoulders of ordinary people, has fallen to new lows. Small wonder that
Jeremy Corbyn did so well in the 2017 general election. Too little has
been learned; too little has changed. Even the limited reforms set in
train since 2010 have not been fully implemented. Worse, the essential
amoral bargain remains in place. Finance can do more or less what it
likes, with pay beyond the dreams of avarice for what Lord Adair Turner,
former chair of the Financial Services Authority, calls activity that is
no better than a system of wealth transference. It is zero-sum: nothing
worthwhile is taking place. Yet, if it collapses, be sure that
governments will be asked to step in again.]{.underline}** Finance can
do more or less as it likes, but if it collapses, be sure that
governments will be asked to step in again The risks are downplayed.
Surely it could not happen again when regulators are more alert and
bankers have been required to provide more of their own capital as a
cushion against mistakes? Yet just a cursory glance at the markets shows
how febrile they are, how exposed to violent movements, how illusory is
their much-vaunted liquidity -- and how rich the pickings remain for
those prepared to take the risks. Note, also, how shaky are the
foundations of the new wave of financial products offering "risk
diversification", notably exchange trading funds (ETF). We live in a
world in which the price of US Treasury bonds -- a market of
multi-trillion dollars -- can move 10% in 10 minutes. What was
bewildering in 2008 was how, as a result of computerised algorithmic buy
and sell instructions, everybody had diversified in the same way -- so
everybody became simultaneous buyers and sellers. That is even more
acute today. All that is required is for, say, Turkey or Italy to
default on their debts, an ETF to become distressed, or a sequence of
Chinese banks to fail (all too imaginable) and the impact would radiate
across the network as it did in 2008. Banks carry far too little capital
to insulate themselves from the shocks -- and governments, again, would
have to step in. **[[Capitalism as it is could not
survive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Trump's [America would not
collaborate in]{.mark} underwriting [a global bailout as]{.mark} the US
did [in 2008.]{.mark} The [trend towards deglobalisation and trade
protection would accelerate]{.mark}. [Brexit Britain]{.mark}, outside
the EU and with a huge financial sector, [would be devastated]{.mark}.
[We must urgently minimise risk and reshape our economy]{.mark}. If not,
today's debates and preoccupations will, in the future, be viewed as
incredible]{.underline}**.

[To chip away at this elaborate fantasy, it helps to begin with some
basic physics. The most fundamental limits to substitution come from
thermodynamics, the branch of physics that studies quantities like heat,
work, and energy. Thermodynamic limits impose constraints on the maximum
efficiency of energy flows through technological systems.]{.underline}
Car engines, power plants, and photovoltaic cells are all limited in
their capacities to convert one type of energy into another.
Technological progress cannot overcome these limits; no car engine can
ever be more efficient than an engine running on the Carnot cycle.20 In
an earlier article for this magazine, I defined the aggregate efficiency
of an economic system as the fraction of all primary energy consumption
that produces mechanical work and electricity.21 I argued that aggregate
efficiencies are highly inertial over time because improving them
substantially requires enormous investments that would disrupt the
reigning economic order. [[Once]{.mark} a [society has settled into
a]{.mark} particular [energy structure, changing it]{.mark} much further
[becomes a daunting task because of elite classes]{.mark} and groups
[that rely heavily on that structure for]{.mark} their [wealth and
influence.]{.mark} [We can look to]{.mark} the recent experience of
[Germany for a]{.mark} prominent [case study]{.mark}. In 2000, [the
German gov]{.mark}ernment [launched]{.mark} its ambitious
[Energiewende,]{.mark} a comprehensive plan [to reduce]{.mark}
greenhouse gas [emissions by shifting energy production towards
renewable]{.mark} [s]{.mark}ources, such as wind and
solar.]{.underline}22 For a time, the program made some notable
achievements. Compared to 1990, greenhouse gas emissions had declined 28
percent by 2017. That same year, renewables reached a 13 percent share
of primary energy consumption. Although these numbers are impressive,
progress has recently come to a standstill. [It has become increasingly
clear that [Germany]{.mark} will not reach the climate targets that it
[s]{.mark}et for 2020.]{.underline} And once we dig into the numbers a
bit deeper, even those that look impressive come with huge caveats. [For
example, the [large reduction of]{.mark} carbon [emissions]{.mark} since
1990 [can be]{.mark} largely [attributed to the collapse of]{.mark}
heavy [industry]{.mark} in East Germany [after reunification. Over the
past eight years]{.mark}, greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark} from Germany
[have hardly changed]{.mark}.]{.underline} The variabilities associated
with wind and solar power have opened up problems related to electricity
storage. Prices fluctuate dramatically depending on weather conditions.
To compensate for these and other issues, [[Germany began sabotaging
its]{.mark} energy [program by constructing]{.mark} a series of [new
coal]{.mark} power [plants when the coal industry pressured]{.mark}
Chancellor Angela [Merkel's gov]{.mark}ernment to relax its policies.
The German example offers an important lesson: [the]{.mark} necessary
[substitution of fossil fuels with renewables will never come fast
enough under]{.mark} the market logic of
[cap]{.mark}italism.]{.underline} Another major limit to substitution
comes from the ecological instabilities associated with excessive levels
of economic growth. These instabilities can combine to pump and amplify
existing natural phenomena. The amplifier effect works as follows.
Economies absorb energy from the natural world and then exploit that
energy for cycles of production and consumption. For highly
energy-intensive economies, these cycles necessarily yield extensive
levels of waste and dissipation, or energy losses that are dumped back
out to the environment. These energy losses are not "useless" from the
standpoint of physics or ecology. Under the right circumstances, they
can power the formation of other natural dynamical systems, including
everything from viruses and bacteria to wildfires and hurricanes.24
These highly chaotic effects associated with energy-intensive economies
are largely ignored and dismissed by neoclassical theory, even though
they have often played a central role in the evolution of human
history.25 As a highly dissipative system, capitalism regularly produces
very powerful amplifier effects. Collectively, these amplifiers are now
creating what Marx called a "metabolic rift" between nature and society,
which means that the ecological basis of civilization is steadily
eroding under profit-seeking and energy-intensive development that does
not care about replacing what it extracts. The natural world has major
tipping points that we should not cross, but indefinite economic growth
through substitution virtually guarantees that some of those critical
thresholds will be breached, threatening the broader ecosphere that
supports human civilization. Consider another problem. Substitution can
occur quite frequently on small and restricted scales of economic
activity. A pizza store can always substitute certain ingredients for
others. A homeowner can substitute heating fuel for insulation. [A
company can replace older light bulbs for more efficient lighting in its
offices. And even some countries can substitute various forms of wealth
for others, at least temporarily. The Pacific island nation of [Nauru
provides a classic example]{.mark} that highlights the central themes of
the debate. In the twentieth century, [Nauru possessed vast deposits of
phosphate, which]{.mark} is highly prized as an agricultural fertilizer.
These deposits [were]{.mark} extensively [mined]{.mark}, depleted,
[and]{.mark} then [traded in global markets, allowing Nauru to reach
a]{.mark} sky-[high standard of living]{.mark} by 1990.]{.underline}28
Nauru converted a portion of its earnings from the phosphate trade into
a public trust fund, which invested in manufactured capital through
financial markets. [However, [its]{.mark} impressive [standard of living
collapsed]{.mark} sharply [after the phosphate vanished, along with most
of the money]{.mark} in the trust fund.]{.underline} Nauru offers a
cautionary tale for the world as a whole. [[If global civilization runs
out of]{.mark} natural [resources, we cannot replace them by investing
in commodities]{.mark} through financial markets. People cannot eat
money.]{.underline} Substitution in the long run may be possible at the
microlevel of economic activity, but long-term macrolevel substitution
is downright wishful thinking.

we cannot replace them by investing in commodities through financial
markets. People cannot eat money. Substitution in the long run may be
possible at the microlevel of economic activity, but long-term
macrolevel substitution is downright wishful thinking. We can better
understand the limits to substitution on a global, macroscopic level by
considering a specific example: a global economy meeting its electricity
needs through the consumption of solar power. There are fundamental
limits to the amount of solar energy absorbed by solar panels that can
be converted into useful electrical energy. Most commercial
photovoltaics convert less than 30 percent of the solar energy they
absorb into electricity; the remaining energy balance is lost as heat
and infrared radiation.30 The theoretical efficiency limits for the most
advanced photovoltaic designs are just under 90 percent, a number that
not even the latest laboratory experiments have come close to matching.
But suppose neoclassical theory is right about its eternal commitment to
technological progress and that eventually we do manage to produce
photovoltaics that are 90 percent efficient at converting solar energy.
[[Once all]{.mark} theoretical [efficiency limits are]{.mark} actually
[realized, boosting]{.mark} electricity [production]{.mark} even further
[would]{.mark} require the construction of new solar panels, which
[take]{.mark}s [up more land]{.mark}. As [the earth has a finite surface
area, indefinite growth]{.mark} [would not be possible even with]{.mark}
the proliferation of [renewables]{.mark}.]{.underline} This argument
underscores the central point that renewable technologies are important,
but they cannot solve the global ecological crisis under the economic
regime of capitalism, which is completely reliant on the false promise
of eternal growth in production and consumption. [Substituting fossil
fuels for renewables while pushing for more growth would still lead to
the total ruin of global civilization in a few centuries.]{.underline}
Economists love to pretend that technological innovation can yield
greater "qualitative growth" without any corresponding "quantitative
growth."32 On the basis of improving knowledge and technological growth,
they believe that the monetary value of stuff can keep increasing even
as the quantity of stuff itself remains stable. But what they fail to
grasp is that technological innovations do not happen magically---they
also require energetic conversions. Changes to the production cycle are
dependent on the stock of electrical, chemical, and mechanical energy
available for research and training. A coder sitting in front of a
computer writing a new program needs energy to think and type. The
computer itself needs electricity to continue operating. No possible
improvement can be made to computer programs without a continuous stream
of energetic conversions. Expansions in productivity require energy
flows, meaning that all forms of technological change are intertwined
with the energetic transformations that facilitate human existence.
Technological changes are physically embedded in greater knowledge among
people and the development of more productive assets, both of which need
energy and material flows to continue operating. [[Thermodynamic
limits]{.mark} also [constrain]{.mark} the extent to which these flows
can be reduced while sustaining labor and capital. In short,
[technological changes]{.mark} themselves [are subject to]{.mark} hard
[physical limits]{.mark}, along with the qualitative growth that can be
derived from them. [Power plants p]{.mark}rovide one of the most
well-known examples of the limits to technological growth. They [have
been hovering near their peak efficiency]{.mark} ratings [for decades
and getting them to go]{.mark} much [further has proven]{.mark} to be
extremely [difficult]{.mark}.]{.underline}33 The failure of breeder
reactors for nuclear power plants highlights another prominent
technological bust, and plenty of other exotic technologies, like fusion
reactors, will inevitably end up in the same category. The bloated
profit margins of capitalism depend critically on the energy-intensive
basis of its entire existence. Take away that basis and there is no more
capitalism. How Energy and Growth Relate to Emissions All economic
activities, as we have seen, require energy. To better understand what
this means, we examine the relationships between energy, growth, and
emissions more concretely by looking at the economy of the United
States. In recent decades, U.S. economic growth has continued, albeit at
a declining rate, even though per-capita primary energy consumption has
gone down. In addition, costs associated with primary energy consumption
increasingly represent a declining share of U.S. aggregate demand. From
these observations, many economists and pundits have concluded that
energy use and economic growth have decoupled from one
another[.]{.mark}35 But even a quick analysis of the underlying energy
shifts in the U.S. economy reveals the falsehood of this narrative. An
economy that starts using natural resources with higher energy
efficiencies and larger power densities can experience growth even as
primary energy consumption declines. Understanding this process would be
difficult, perhaps even impossible, if we only looked at primary
consumption, which totally ignores conversions. But once we consider
that burning a smaller quantity of natural gas, for example, can still
yield more electricity than burning a larger amount of coal, then the
significance of conversions becomes immediately apparent. Resources with
larger power densities can convert more useful energy for economic
activities, some of which constitute the basic elements measured by GDP.
Economists like David Stern and Robert Kaufmann, among others, have
clearly shown that growth in U.S. energy consumption is tightly coupled
with growth in aggregate demand once differences in energy quality are
factored into the analysis.36 The energy crisis of the 1970s motivated
the United States to reduce per-capita oil consumption and to focus on
efficiency gains by using other natural resources. These efforts
resulted in a trajectory of increased natural-gas consumption, which is
much cleaner and more efficient as an energy source than coal. Both the
switch to natural gas and the increasing proliferation of renewables
helped substantially reduce carbon emissions. After peaking in 2005,
greenhouse gas emissions in the United States had fallen 14 percent by
2016.37 But the declines gradually stalled and emissions in 2018
actually increased by more than 3 percent, the largest rise in 8
years.38 A hyperactive transportation sector, always critical to
economic growth, was the leading culprit behind the latest surge. Recent
U.S. experience further reinforces the notion that large-scale
reductions in emissions are virtually impossible under an economic
system that prioritizes growth above anything else. The unlimited
pressure to increase consumption and production can lead to rising
emissions even in the context of macrolevel efficiency gains and
technological innovations. For the world as a whole, a strong positive
relationship exists between primary energy consumption and economic
growth, and numerous studies on various countries and regions indicate
that this relationship is fundamentally causal.39 Over the last few
decades, the rate of global economic growth has started to slow down,
mirroring the declining rate of growth in global energy consumption.
Some major economies, like those of Japan and the European Union, have
already entered periods of stagnation associated with very low growth
rates and aging populations. Because these economies are currently
dominated by corrupt financial sectors, they are generating uneven
growth patterns that mostly enrich wealthy capitalists. By contrast,
ordinary people are increasingly drowning in debt so they can finance
the cycles and crises of capitalism.40 Economic progress for the vast
majority of society has come to a screeching halt.41 The global economy
may continue to grow at modest rates for the rest of this century, but
the signs are already evident that our potential for future growth is
limited and constrained by what kinds of energy sources we can collect
from the natural world, as well as by the economic irrationalities of
today's financialized capitalism. Capitalism is running out of steam,
but not quickly enough to substantially reduce aggregate emissions.
Global carbon emissions over the last century have closely followed
changes in primary energy consumption. At the start of the decade,
optimism about global warming was high. Greenhouse gas emissions
flatlined for several years and the upper echelons of the global economy
started to believe that economic growth could actually be decoupled from
harmful emissions. In 2016, the International Energy Agency triumphantly
declared: "Decoupling of global emissions and economic growth
confirmed."42 What a difference two years can make. In 2017, greenhouse
gas emissions worldwide saw a sharp spike.43 Against a backdrop of
increasingly alarming scientific reports about the dangers of global
warming, emissions rose again for 2018, at a faster pace than the
previous year.44 Even some advanced economies that had supposedly
decoupled growth from pollution witnessed higher carbon emissions in
2018. Detaching emissions from economic growth has turned out to be a
vastly more complicated problem than global elites originally believed.
A persistent albatross on this issue is the way that most elites talk
about carbon emissions. When governments and organizations measure
greenhouse gas emissions, they often do so at the point of manufacture
and production. If a U.S. company sets up a factory in India to produce
commodities that are then sold to U.S. consumers, the emissions coming
from that factory are credited to India, not the United States. This
basic process of what is referred to as geographic substitution, where
corporations from the capitalist core transfer ecologically destructive
manufacturing to developing nations with large pools of cheap labor, has
been an important source of the observed divergence between carbon
emissions and economic growth in the Western world.45 In other words,
measuring emissions from the point of consumption hardly reveals any
decoupling at all. In any case, multinational corporations can only keep
shifting production around so much before they run out of places to go.
There are limits to geographic substitution as well. Besides comparing
aggregate demand to emissions, another approach for understanding the
material foundations of economic growth focuses on the flow of raw
materials on their way to the final point of consumption. In a landmark
2012 paper, a group of Australian researchers analyzed the aggregate raw
materials exchanged among countries through international trade and
introduced the concept of the material footprint, defined as the global
allocation of used raw material extraction to the final demand of an
economy. They concluded that "with every 10 percent increase in gross
domestic product, the average national \[material footprint\] increases
by 6 percent."46 In their view, "achievements in decoupling in advanced
economies are smaller than reported or even nonexistent." They also
estimated that roughly 40 percent of all global raw materials are
extracted to facilitate the export of goods and services to other
nations, which indicates that reducing the international flows of global
capital could be a critical strategy in addressing our intensifying
ecological crisis. For another perspective on why claims about
decoupling are premature, consider the following fact: life expectancy
in the United States has declined for three consecutive years, the first
such sustained decline in a century.47 The U.S. economy grew in every
one of those years. But the press did not blare the sirens declaring
that life expectancy has decoupled from economic growth. Such an
admission would raise an unthinkable prospect for the reigning
plutocracy: that the lives of common people might actually be getting
worse while some billionaires become even richer by selling the rest of
us more stuff that does not actually improve our lives. However, when
two or three years of mixed and uncertain data suggest that the rise in
harmful global emissions has slowed down, the story gets blown out of
proportion and becomes a masterful causal narrative about how capitalism
can be ecologically sustainable. The collapse of the decoupling delusion
offers an important lesson---we should resist the temptation to make
grand conclusions about the world when we notice marginal trends over
just a few years.

###  A2 Sustainable -- Decoupling

**Their evidence conflates [relative]{.underline} decoupling with
[absolute]{.underline} which is [impossible]{.underline}\-\--**[EROI
decreases]{.underline}, [emission outsourcing]{.underline}, [no global
spill-over]{.underline}, and [rebound effects]{.underline}

**Ferguson 19**---Lecturer in Politics and Policy at Deakin University,
his research focuses on the political barriers to moving toward a
socially just and ecologically sustainable global economy, published
articles in peer reviewed journals on environmental politics and green
economics \[Peter, 2019, *Post-growth Politics A Critical Theoretical
and Policy Framework for Decarbonisation*, Chapter 2: The Problem with
Economic Growth, pgs 19-21, Springer\] AMarb

The claim that economic growth and long-term ecological sustainability
can be compatible is generally presented in one of four ways. The first
is to argue that growth can be effectively 'decoupled' from
environmental damage. [Decoupling aims to reconfigure production
processes to make them more ecologically 'efficient']{.underline}, so
that economic output becomes progressively less dependent upon material
throughput. In this context, [[it is **critical to distinguish**]{.mark}
between [**relative** and **absolute decoupling**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Relative decoupling refers to a reduction in the biophysical throughput
of each unit of production, so that resource use declines relative to
GDP. In this situation, environmental externalities still increase but
at a slower rate than overall GDP growth. There is some evidence to
support the relative decoupling hypothesis. For example, the amount of
energy required to produce each unit of global economic output has
fallen gradually over the past 50 years, so that worldwide energy
intensity is now 33% lower than it was in 1970. The problem is, however,
that [**[total energy use]{.mark} has [increased exponentially]{.mark}**
[as the economy has grown.]{.mark}]{.underline} For instance, whilst the
carbon intensity of the global economy declined from one kilogram of
carbon dioxide per US dollar of production in 1980 to 770 grams in 2006,
total global carbon emissions actually increased over the same period by
80% (Jackson 2009a). At the same time, some [widely used [forms of
energy are]{.mark} actually [becoming]{.mark} **increasingly [less
efficient]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [most significant of
these is [**oil**,]{.mark} as the [**costs of extracting remaining
reserves** in]{.mark} terms of both [**financial and energy
expenditure** are **set to grow exponentially**]{.mark}]{.underline}
over coming decades. This is because [most of the easily accessible and
most bountiful oil fields have already been exploited, as demonstrated
by the]{.underline} Energy Returned on Energy Invested [**(EROEI)
index**.]{.underline} In 1930, the [[EROEI for oil]{.mark} produced in
the US]{.underline} was about from 100 to 1. This had [[declined]{.mark}
to 30 to 1 by 1970 and [to 12 to 1 in 2005.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
[[ratios for]{.mark} other fossil fuels such as [**coal** and **gas**
are]{.mark} also [in **decline**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Heinberg 2011).
Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency [(IEA) has estimated that
**world oil production peaked during 2006**]{.underline} (International
Energy Agency 2011),4 although the recent development of unconventional
oil fields such as the Alberta tar sands appears to be postponing the
decline in production (Lukacs 2014). [[What is needed is **absolute
decoupling**]{.mark}, where total material throughput is reduced
irrespective of the rate of growth. [Evidence of this]{.mark} form of
decoupling, however, [is]{.mark} rather [**scant**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
In a very small number of countries, there does appear to have been
something of a stabilisation of resource throughput since the late
1980s. However, this appears to have been achieved largely by moving
production offshore and thus effectively outsourcing environmental
externalities, usually to the Global South (Jackson 2009a).5 [[In the
UK]{.mark}, for example a reported [6% reduction in domestic
**g**]{.mark}reen**[h]{.mark}**ouse **[g]{.mark}**a**[s]{.mark}**
emissions]{.underline} between 1990 and 2004 [actually [equates to an
**11% increase in emissions** when]{.mark} the [**emissions embodied in
imports** are taken into account]{.mark}]{.underline} (Jackson 2009a).
[[What matters]{.mark}, therefore, [is]{.mark} not evidence of absolute
decoupling at the national level, but its **existence at [a global
scale]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Unfortunately, [[as]{.mark} the
**[80-fold increase in]{.mark} global carbon [emissions]{.mark}** since
1980 cited above [indicates, this has not happened.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Of course, the current absence of absolute decoupling does not provide
irrefutable proof of the impossibility of any future structural shift in
this direction (Hepburn and Bowen 2013). Indeed, many technologies, such
as the microchip and the photovoltaic cell, have achieved exponential
increases in efficiency accompanied by dramatic reductions in costs.
Nonetheless, in a growing economy [absolute [decoupling is]{.mark}
likely [to **remain elusive** because]{.mark} **gains in resource
efficiency** are almost always **absorbed** by **increases in resource
consumption**]{.underline} (Herring 2006). Some analysts claim that
[this ['**rebound effect**' can negate]{.mark} as much as 60--**[100% of
energy savings]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Saunders 2010).6 For example, the
[efficiency of electricity usage in the United States increased by
57.3%]{.underline} during the twentieth century [at the same time that
total annual electricity consumption increased by 630%]{.underline}
(Victor 2008). Some analysts suggest that the rebound effect can be
negated without necessarily impeding growth by properly pricing
environmental externalities (Hepburn and Bowen 2013). This appears to
have happened in California, where over the past 30 years, rigorous
energy efficiency measures and demand management have prevented per
capita electricity consumption from increasing. Over the same period, in
the rest of the United States, per capita electricity consumption has
increased on average by 1.4% per year in the absence of concerted
national energy efficiency measures (Afsah et al. 2012).

###  A2 Sustainable -- Epistemology

#### All their sustainability claims are epistemologically suspect and should be rejected on face

**Ahmed 17**---Executive Director of the Institute for Policy Research
and Development \[Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, 2017, *Failing States,
Collapsing Systems BioPhysical Triggers of Political Violence*,
Introduction, pg 4, Springer Briefs in Energy, Accessed through the Wake
Forest Library\] AMarb

Part of this study, then, identifies how [[conventional]{.mark}
governmental, industry and media [narratives]{.mark} of these crises for
the most part [**fail** to accurately understand
them]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} not just due to a lack of a
holistic-systemic frameworks for examining these crises as
interdependent---but [[due to]{.mark} a fundamental [**epistemological
failure** that]{.mark} has [allowed **mythological** 'theories' of human
progress in]{.mark} the form of]{.underline} neoclassical and
[[neoliberal economics to become **entrenched** as]{.mark} the
[**dominant cognitive paradigm**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [most
powerful **hegemonic component** of this **ideological
capture**]{.underline} of human collective cognition [occurs
through]{.underline} the [global institutions associated with the
mainstream media.]{.underline} The principal problem here is a highly
compromised ownership and editorial structure that ties media outlets to
the very prevailing structures of fossil fuel-centric power complicit in
global crisis acceleration. The [[preponderance of **fossil fuel-centric
interests**]{.mark} in conventional media]{.underline} ownership [[has
led to consistently **inaccurate reporting** on energy issues, and their
relationships with]{.mark} economic, food and [climate
crises]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as specific conflicts. Yet to some
extent, and compounding the insular ideological approach of powerful
government, industry and media institutions, [there has been a similar
failure from amongst experts in different fields of these crises, who
have been unable to develop theoretical, conceptual and empirical
frameworks to view their specialized data]{.underline} in its inherent
interconnections with data from other fields. In other words, a lack of
generalized systems training in our schools. Due to this problem, [we
are beginning to grasp only recently the extent to which geopolitical
ruptures]{.underline} that overwhelm of the news of the day [have been
exacerbated by a convergence of crises studied largely
separately]{.underline} in these disparate fields. [There
is]{.underline}, therefore, [little understanding of how energy and
resource depletion tangibly impact the political economies of different
societies, and how these processes interact with]{.underline} the local
impacts of global processes like [climate change. [This has led to a
**knowledge deficit**]{.mark}]{.underline}---specifically, a whole
systems knowledge deficit [[comprising a **paucity of reliable**,
**actionable knowledge**]{.mark} in the mainstream, exacerbating a sense
of public apathy and confusion]{.underline}, and cementing a
policymaking impasse among political leaders who remain subject to a
fatal combination of intensive fossil fuel lobbying and media
misinformation.

#### You should be skeptical of their sustainability claims\-\--it's based off manipulated consciousness

Sociology, University of Barcelona, specialized in environmental
sociology. He has conducted research and published on human needs and

As if the false perceptions mentioned above were not enough, [[there are
groups of society with private interests]{.mark} whose future is [bound
to]{.mark} the **capitalist socio-economic model**, which
is]{.underline} expansive by nature and [linked to [**economic
growth**.]{.mark}]{.underline} These [[groups do not want people to be
aware of the limits of the planet, preferring]{.mark} instead for
[them]{.mark} to continue [to cherish]{.mark} the [**illusion of
indefinite growth** and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus support their
socio-economic model, a model that provides them with abundance and
which, it must also be noted, [[only a]{.underline}]{.mark} quarter or
[[**fifth of humanity** have been able to enjoy.]{.underline}]{.mark}
These [[**privileged groups** seek to prolong a system]{.mark} of
living, production and consumption [that gives them **immense
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, beyond the wildest dreams of the tyrants
of days gone by. Energy, chemical, pharmaceutical, mechanical,
electronics, transport and food companies, alongside many others, have
linked their existence to the current social order and use immoral
methods to prolong it as long as they can. [[They]{.mark} use a wide
range of techniques to [**manipulate** the market and
consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}, most notably by lobbying the elected
representatives of the people in parliaments and other public
institutions, [inciting corruption and [controlling the media]{.mark} by
paying mercenary journalists [to spread untruths]{.mark}]{.underline} or
half-truths. Thus, [they have been able to postpone **consciousness of
climate change**]{.underline} ("deniers" being a case in point) [and
"peak oil".]{.underline} Furthermore, [they have placed
obstacles]{.underline} not only in the way of the dissemination of
scientific achievements but also [in the way of scientific research that
has the potential to curtail the harmful industrial
exploitation]{.underline} of certain discoveries (a case in point being
research into the effects of genetically modified plants on the human
body exemplified by the Séralini affair). The [enormous forces exercised
on politics by the plutocracy help **delay our awareness** of the need
for major changes.]{.underline}

###  A2 Sustainable -- Innovation 

#### Growth breeds systemic complexity which reduces marginal returns and restricts innovation

**Korowicz '11** David Korowicz, physicist & human-systems ecologist at
Feasta & independent consultant, "On the cusp of collapse: complexity,
energy, and the globalised economy," Fleeing Vesuvius, 10/8/2011,
http://fleeingvesuvius.org/2011/10/08/on-the-cusp-of-collapse-complexity-energy-and-the-globalised-economy/

[[Complexity can be measured]{.mark} in several ways --- [as]{.mark} the
number of [connections between people and institutions]{.mark}, the
[intensity of hierarchical networks]{.mark}, the number of [distinct
products]{.mark} produced and the extent of the [supply-chain
networks]{.mark} required to produce them, the number of [specialised
occupations]{.mark}, the amount of [effort required to manage
systems]{.mark}, the amount of [information]{.mark} available
[and]{.mark} the [energy flows]{.mark} required to maintain them. By all
these measures, economic [growth has been associated with increasing
complexity]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[4\] As a species, [we had to become
problem solvers to meet our basic needs, deal with status anxiety and
respond to the new challenges presented by a dynamic
environment]{.underline}. The problem to be solved could be simple such
as getting a bus or buying bread; or it could be complex, such as
developing an economy's energy infrastructure. [[We tend to exploit the
easiest and least costly solutions first]{.mark}. We pick [the lowest
hanging fruit or the easiest extractable oil]{.mark} first. [As problems
are solved new ones]{.mark} tend to [require more]{.mark} effort and
[complex solutions. A solution is framed within a network of
constraints]{.mark}. One of the system constraints is set by the
operational fabric, comprising the given conditions at any time and
place which support system wide functionality. For modern developed
economies this includes functioning markets, financing, monetary
stability, operational supply-chains, transport, digital infrastructure,
command and control, health services, research and development
infrastructure, institutions of trust and socio-political stability. It
is what we casually assume does and will exist, and which provides the
structural foundation for any project we wish to develop. Our solutions
are also limited by [knowledge and culture]{.mark}, and by the
[available energetic, material, and economic resources]{.mark} available
to us.]{.underline} The formation of solutions is also shaped by the
interactions with the myriad other interacting agents such as people,
businesses and institutions. [These add to the dynamic complexity of the
environment in which the solution is formed, and thus the growing
complexity is likely to be reinforced as elements co-evolve
together.]{.underline} As a result, the process of [economic growth and
complexity has been self-reinforcing]{.underline}. The growth in the
size of the networks of exchange, the operational fabric and economic
efficiencies all provided a basis for further growth. [Growing
complexity provided the foundation for developing even more complex
integration.]{.underline} In aggregate, as the operational fabric
evolves in complexity it provides the basis to build more complex
solutions. The net [[benefits of]{.mark} increasing [complexity are
subject to declining marginal returns]{.mark}]{.underline} --- in other
words, [the benefit of rising complexity is eventually outweighed by its
cost. [A major cost is environmental destruction and resource
depletion]{.mark}. There is also the cost of complexity itself. We can
see this in the costs of managing more complex systems, and the
increasing cost of the research and development process]{.underline}.
\[5\] [When increased complexity begins to have a net cost, then
[responding to new problems arising by further increasing complexity may
be no longer viable]{.mark}. An economy becomes locked into established
processes and infrastructures, but can no longer respond to shocks or
adapt to change. For the historian Joseph Tainter, this is the context
in which earlier civilisations have collapsed]{.underline}. \[6\]

###  A2 Sustainable -- Progress

#### Social and economic inequality is only getting worse

**Chen 12-29-16**

Michelle Chen (contributing editor at In These Times and Dissent
magazine, and associate editor at CultureStrike. She is also a
co-producer of "Asia Pacific Forum" on Pacifica's WBAI and Dissent's
"Belabored" podcast, and studies history at the City University of New
York Graduate Center). "﻿Inequality Is Only Getting Worse." The Nation.
December 29^th^, 2016.
https://www.thenation.com/article/inequality-is-worse/

Donald Trump boasted that his election reflected the "voice of the
people," but it was mostly the voice of fear. And while ingrained racism
and misogyny drove much of Trump's support, his popularity reflected a
massive sense of loss: real economic loss, perceived cultural loss, and
anticipatory loss for their children's generation. Just how "real" this
decline actually has been, however, depends on where you stand, and
where you're falling from. A recent study of stratification and eroding
quality of life across generations, between races, and between
socioeconomic classes sheds light on how America's so-called "middle
class" perceives itself. Social-inequality trends over the past half
century indicate that class divisions are growing more rigid, most are
getting worse off, and those at the bottom are falling further, faster
by the day. It's the momentum of change that is causing much of the pain
and anxiety, as many self-identified "middle-class Americans" are
realizing the truth only now: They were never as well-off as they
thought they were. "Overall, if you look back 30 years, most of the
distribution \[of wealth\] is lower than where it was in the '80s.
So...the typical American family today has less wealth than the typical
American family in the '80s," says University of Michigan sociologist
Fabian Pfeffer, who co-published a new research collection on trends in
inequality. And yet, Pfeffer observes, higher on the economic hierarchy,
affluent households experienced "the mirror image," accruing riches and
power at others' expense. [For households losing wealth, Pfeffer found
that [social insecurity hurts from many different angles: not
just]{.mark} in the [evaporation of housing]{.mark} and retirement
wealth [but also]{.mark} through [declining health]{.mark}, diminished
prospects for their kids, [and ensuing despair and
anger]{.mark}]{.underline}. "One of the things wealth gives you is
safety and security," Pfeffer says, but when insecurity becomes chronic
"as labor markets become more insecure...and as public safety nets
become more porous...that role of private safety nets, such as in the
form of wealth, may become even more pronounced." Take the case of a
working-class, jobless white youth in a marginal postindustrial suburb.
He hovers in the same social status as his blue-collar parents, but his
life is markedly harder than theirs were. He is priced out of higher
education in a community with few living-wage jobs and has virtually
none of the health or retirement benefits his parents attained through
their now-vanished industrial vocations. [But white anxiety about
middle-class precarity is only part of the picture because [the
middle-class was always built on **structural inequality and social
exclusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The anxiety Trump manipulated so
deftly on the campaign trail expresses real agony that working people
are feeling. Yet the people who aren't represented in Trump's support
base are in many ways suffering the most from long-term economic
polarization. [Compared to whites, [the downward trajectory has been
steeper in communities of color. A]{.mark} typical low-income [black kid
has even dimmer college prospects, having been deprived of early
education and decent housing and health care]{.mark} from birth. [She
grows up with greater exposure to traumas like mass incarceration or
foreclosure.]{.mark}]{.underline} Racial discrimination limits her
career opportunities and she moves from teenage poverty into
inescapable, lifelong debt after getting hit by predatory lenders. While
her parents were also poor, they benefited from public welfare and
education programs, and retired with modest savings instead of an
underwater mortgage. Towering high above both these young people is the
affluent white youth who inherits her parents' educational advantages,
graduates debt-free, and has the social capital that accrues over her
formative years spent in a privileged community network. Her segment of
society is pulling away from both low-income black and white
communities. [Pfeffer's analysis shows that ["the probability of
becoming part of the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans is seven times
greater if your parents were also in the top 20 percent]{.mark} \[of
income earners\] instead of the bottom." And **[social mobility could
decline further in the coming years]{.mark}**. This is in part perhaps
why [Trump was able to win votes with his vision of restoring
"greatness," but **such a restoration is a return to a fundamentally
unfair social structure built on a zero-sum economy that has been
cratering on itself for decades**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such political
polarization can poison democracy. As Princeton economist Angus Deaton
contended, since economic elites are inclined to push policies that
impoverish public social infrastructure and distribute wealth upward on
the income scale (and into their pockets), the political system becomes
increasingly undemocratic---and plutocracy becomes even more entrenched.
The 50-year trajectory of class polarization isn't likely to end anytime
soon. A political solution probably isn't forthcoming under Trump's
impending reign of chaos. But for the rising generation, there may be
some promise in the debate around rebuilding "infrastructure." Rather
than roads and bridges, however, a more radical approach would develop
our social infrastructure. An emphasis on social programs that would
directly benefit people's lives could be a redistributive, comprehensive
corrective for the wealth gap, and would carry real populist appeal.
"The one public infrastructure that I see as the most in need of public
investment is education," Pfeffer says, "and that is also because the
private investment \[has grown\] more unequal, partly thanks to this
growth in the wealth gap." In coming years, there will be a chance for a
grassroots movement to emerge and press for a stronger public-education
system as an intervention against further decline in the next
generation---it could stop kids today from falling through the gaps that
ensnared their parents. Trump found support among people who supposedly
lacked formal education. Yet they keenly understood how it felt to be
cheated by the system. The blame for middle-class decline, however,
which should be aimed at the top, was tragically misdirected at others
on the bottom, whom Trump and right-wing media inaccurately portrayed as
having an unfair advantage. Overall, a huge chunk of the country is
sliding down; some have just been slipping a little faster in recent
years. The more crowded it gets on the bottom rung, the harder it is to
see those climbing at the top and leaving the rest of us behind.

###  A2 Sustainable -- Resources

#### They can delay resource constraints, but it won't offset environmental impacts

**Ferguson 19**---Lecturer in Politics and Policy at Deakin University,
his research focuses on the political barriers to moving toward a
socially just and ecologically sustainable global economy, published
articles in peer reviewed journals on environmental politics and green
economics \[Peter, 2019, *Post-growth Politics A Critical Theoretical
and Policy Framework for Decarbonisation*, Chapter 2: The Problem with
Economic Growth, pgs 21-2, Springer\] AMarb

A second argument for the compatibility of growth and environmental
protection is that any exhausted finite resource can be readily
substituted with another. For instance, [advocates of **infinite
substitutability** argue that conventional oil can be replaced with
shale oil]{.underline} or biofuel and natural fibres with synthetics.
All that is required is access to sufficient amounts of capital and
energy to mine and process these resources (Goeller and Weinberg 1978).
However, [there are at least two fundamental problems with this
argument. First, [energy]{.mark}]{.underline}, as noted above, [[is a
**physical parameter** and]{.mark}, therefore, [**cannot be created out
of thin air**. **Energy stocks are**]{.mark} **thus [just as finite as
other resources]{.mark}**[. This applies]{.mark} both [to
**fossil**]{.mark} and **[mineral]{.mark}** resources [and]{.mark} to
**[solar resources]{.mark}**, because whilst the former are physically
finite, the latter are limited by the amount of solar radiation that can
be captured at the Earth's surface.]{.underline} The [[**capacity to
capture energy flows** is also]{.mark} a **[limiting]{.mark} factor**
for other forms of renewable energy]{.underline} such as biofuels, wind,
wave and geothermal resources. The other problem is that [[even where
this energy is available, exploiting it]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially
in the form of fossil fuels or radioactive ores, [[can create]{.mark}
serious [**climatic and ecosystemic side effects** that]{.mark} the
**[Earth cannot sustain]{.mark} above certain thresholds**]{.underline}
(Bardi 2011). So, although the substitution of resources is possible up
to a point, [[it is **not a long-term solution** to]{.mark} the problem
of [resource scarcity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

###  A2 Tech

#### Tech creates a cyclical trap that causes endless resource depletion

**Ferguson 19**---Lecturer in Politics and Policy at Deakin University,
his research focuses on the political barriers to moving toward a
socially just and ecologically sustainable global economy, published
articles in peer reviewed journals on environmental politics and green
economics \[Peter, 2019, *Post-growth Politics A Critical Theoretical
and Policy Framework for Decarbonisation*, Chapter 2: The Problem with
Economic Growth, pgs 22-3, Springer\] AMarb

The fourth standard argument for why economic growth need not generate
environmental degradation is that technological innovations will always
solve environmental problems. However, [[improvements in
tech]{.mark}nological efficiency tend to [yield **increasingly marginal
benefits**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[**historical development**
of]{.mark} a range of [technologies exhibited]{.mark} an
**[initial]{.mark} period of intense [improvement]{.mark}** [that
**gradually subsided**]{.mark} as these technologies were refined. A
prime example of this is the motor[car]{.mark}, which]{.underline} more
or less achieved its modern form during the 1920s. Whilst it has become
much faster, safer and more comfortable over the ensuing decades, it
[[has **not**]{.mark} **on average [become more fuel
efficient]{.mark}**[, and has]{.mark} actually [become **more resource
intensive**]{.mark}]{.underline} in its manufacture (Bardi 2011).
Indeed, [**[patterns of declining]{.mark} improvements in
[efficiency]{.mark}** in a **number of specific sectors** [can]{.mark}
in many respects [be **accurately generalised** to broader
trends]{.mark}in technological development]{.underline} (Ayres 2001). As
a result, the [[capacity of]{.mark} technological [innovation to
decouple]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark} from environmental damage [is
**steadily diminishing**]{.mark}. Claims to the contrary]{.underline},
such as those made by Ernst von Weizsäcker et al. (1997), who hold that
in the coming decades the amount of wealth extracted from one unit of
natural resources is likely to quadruple [rely on a **completely
unfounded** degree of **technological optimism**]{.underline} (see also
Basiago 1994; Huesemann 2003). Moreover, as demonstrated above, [unless
these improvements in resource efficiency are accompanied by a **move to
a steady-state economy**, absolute [**resource use will continue to
grow**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

###  A2 Transition Wars

#### Appeals to fear of collapse are epistemologically constrictive and legitimize the status quo

**Žižek '97** (Slavoj Žižek, Senior Researcher in the Department of
Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana and Codirector of the Center
for Humanities at Birkbeck College, \"Multiculturalism, or, the Cultural
Logic of Multinational Capitalism,\" New Left Review, No. 224, 1997,
pp.25-27)

Today, [financial crisis is a permanent state of things the reference to
which legitimizes]{.underline} the demands to cut social spending,
health care, support of culture and scientific research, in short, [the
dismantling of the welfare state. Is, however, this permanent crisis
really an objective feature of our socio-economic life? Is it not rather
one of the effects of the shift of balance in the 'class struggle'
towards Capital, resulting from the growing role of new technologies as
well as from the direct internationalization of Capital and the co-
dependent diminished role of the Nation-State which was further able to
impose certain minimal requirements and limitations to exploitation? In
other words, [the crisis is an 'objective fact']{.mark} if and [only if
one accepts]{.mark} in advance [as an unquestionable premise the]{.mark}
inherent [logic of Capital]{.mark}]{.underline}---as more and more
left-wing or liberal parties have done. We are thus witnessing the
uncanny spectacle of social-democratic parties which came to power with
the between-the-lines message to Capital 'we will do the necessary job
for you in an even more efficient and painless way than the
conservatives'. The problem, of course, is that, [in today's global
socio-political circumstances, [it is]{.mark} practically
[impossible]{.mark} effectively [to call into question the logic]{.mark}
of Capital: [even a modest]{.mark} social-democratic [attempt to
redistribute wealth]{.mark} beyond the limit acceptable to the Capital
['effectively' leads to]{.mark} economic crisis, [inflation, a fall in
revenues]{.mark} and so on. Nevertheless, one should always bear in mind
how [the connection between 'cause']{.mark}]{.underline} (rising social
expenditure) [[and 'effect']{.mark}]{.underline} (economic crisis) [[is
not a direct objective]{.mark} causal [one: it is always-]{.mark}already
[embedded in a situation of social antagonism and struggle]{.mark}. The
fact that, [if one does not obey the limits set by Capital, a crisis
'really follows', in no way 'proves' that the necessity of these limits
is]{.mark} an [objective]{.mark} necessity of economic life. It should
rather be conceived as a proof of the privileged position Capital holds
in the economic and political struggle]{.underline}, as in the situation
where a stronger partner threatens that if you do X, you will be
punished by Y, and then, upon your doing X, Y effectively ensues.

#### Autonomous communities band together in resistance to capital -- that prevents capitalist victory

**Kovel '2** (Joel Kovel, Professor of Social Studies at Bard College,
2002, The Enemy of Nature, p. 236-238)

If such events as O'Connor envisions were to come to pass, they would
not yet be ecosocialism, but they would form a kind of self-generative
and non-linear dialectic that can rapidly accelerate the motion toward
ecosocialism. After all, it is the 'tens of thousands of local and
regional experiments and practices' who would have had to join with
communities of activation to make this possible, and whose power would
be accordingly magnified by it. And being magnified, the Zapatistas, and
the Gaviotistas, and the Indymedia centres that connect them, and the
politicized collectives of farmers from around the world, and the
teacher's associations, and the ecologically radicalized fractions of
the labour movement, and the little Bruderhof-like manufacturing
collectives making ecologically sane products with the aid of local
credit unions, and [[all the ten thousand locally originating but
universally striving community formations]{.mark} --- all [would come
together in solidarity to make such an event]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}, in
its aftermath, to [press for]{.mark} further
[transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is no point in predicting a
scenario according to which this will expand, beyond the condition that
it occur in the context of capital's incapability of regulating the
ecological crisis. At some time within this span, the communities
arising from the process may be imagined to grow to a point of relative
autonomy such that they can begin providing material support for
activists, with bases of operation and --- in the case of those
considerable number of communities producing food, wool, hemp, solar
technology and so on --- the actual means of subsistence for people
engaged in revolutionary struggle. It must also be presumed --- a large
but feasible order that these people will have developed the spiritual
and psychological strength enabling them to go forward. For there should
be no mistake: the struggle for ecosocialism is no technical or
voluntaristic process, but a radical transforming of self as well as
world to link up in ever-widening and deepening solidarity Here is where
post-patriarchal values will come forward, radicalizing human being
itself for the struggle. Now the movement of events is self-sustaining,
rapid and dramatic[. Communities of place and of praxis increasingly
coalesce to form miniature societies, and these enter into relations
with others]{.underline} both inside and outside the national boundary.
Capital may be expected to respond with heightened efforts at
repression. A heroic phase begins, with much sacrifice. The awesome
might of [[the capital system now encounters a set of factors it has
never dealt with before: ∙ The forces against it are both numerous and
dispersed]{.mark}. ∙ They operate with changed needs, and on the basis
of a kind of production capable of sustaining itself]{.underline} with
small inputs and labour-intensive technologies; and they have secure
bases and 'safe houses' in the intentional communities of resistance,
now extending across national boundaries. ∙ Their many allies in the
interstices of the mainstream society are capable of forming support
groups and 'underground railroads'. ∙ As with all successful forms of
revolutionary protest, [the [oppositional forces are capable of shutting
down normal production]{.mark} through strikes, boycotts, and mass
actions. ∙ The forces of capital have lost confidence, and are further
undermined by support for the revolution]{.underline} within the
alternative parties and their various niches in the state. This extends
to armies and police. When the first of these lays down their arms and
joins the revolution, the turning point is reached. [[The behaviour of
the revolutionaries is spiritually superior]{.mark}, and the examples
they set are given credibility and persuasiveness by the brute facts of
the crisis and the gathering realization that what is at stake here is
not so much the redistribution of wealth as the sustenance of life
itself.]{.underline} Thus it could be that in an increasingly hectic
period, millions of people take to the streets, and join together in
global solidarity --- with each other, with the communities of
resistance, and with their comrades in other nations --- bringing normal
social activity to a halt, petitioning the state and refusing to take
'no' for an answer, and driving capital into ever smaller pens. [[With
defections mounting and the irreducible fact all around that the people
demand a new beginning in order to save the planetary ecology, the state
apparatus passes into new hands]{.mark}, the expropriators are
expropriated, [and the 500-year regime of capital
falls]{.mark}.]{.underline}

###  A2 Venezuela

#### Venezuela is a case of disaster capitalism: their discourse around it justifies the logic of interventionaism

**López 19** (Reinaldo Antonio Iturriza López, (Puerto Ordaz, Bolívar,
Venezuela, November 30, 1973), is a Venezuelan politician, sociologist
and writer. He was the Minister of Popular Power for Culture of
Venezuela from September 2014 to January 2016. "Venezuela and Disaster
Capitalism" 2/5/19.
<https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4232-venezuela-and-disaster-capitalism>)
ME.

On Monday, January 28, the Department of the Treasury of the United
States announced it was placing a "block" on all of Petróleos de
Venezuela's (PDVSA) assets under US jurisdiction, prohibiting its
citizens from engaging in any type of transaction with the Venezuelan
state-owned oil company.\[1\] Secretary Steve Mnuchin added that "if the
people of Venezuela want to continue to sell us oil", we will only
accept it on the condition that our money goes to "blocked accounts",
which would later be made available for the "transition
government".\[2\] According to National Security Advisor John Bolton,
the sanctions imposed on PDVSA would provoke a loss of some 11 billion
dollars in exports for 2019, and a freeze on 7 billion dollars in
assets. On January 24th, Bolton declared on FOX Business, "It will make
a big difference to the United States economically if we could have
American oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in
Venezuela". Just three minutes before effectively confessing the true
intentions of US imperialism, Bolton asserted that Chávez and Maduro had
"impoverished Venezuela. We now have between three and four million
refugees who have fled the country, something unprecedented in the
history of the Western Hemisphere. Maduro and Hugo Chávez before him
systematically looted the oil resources of the country. There is no
capital investment, and income is declining. Society is literally
collapsing in Venezuela". These factors, Bolton continued, provide the
justification for the Trump Administration's recognition of Juan Guaidó
as "Interim President".\[3\] **[[A few hours after sanctions]{.mark}
were publicly announced, on January 29, the [Venezuela]{.mark}n National
Assembly [approved an "Agreement for the Promotion of a National Rescue
Plan]{.mark}", which upheld that Venezuela was experiencing a "social
and economic collapse" that had produced a "humanitarian emergency",
consequence of the policies of the "regime of Nicolás Maduro",
[which]{.mark} has [installed a "totalitarian economic and political
model for domination and social control]{.mark}", otherwise known as
"21st century socialism".\[4\] Behold, a concise summary of the way in
which foreign and [local agents put in practice]{.mark} what Naomi Klein
defined as "[disaster capitalism]{.mark}" in her formidable Shock
Doctrine-- a useful framework for understanding what is happening in
Venezuela, at a time when forces are conspiring to severely -- if
possible, irreparably -- affect our ability to interpret our own
present. With "disaster capitalism", Klein refers to "[orchestrated
raids on the public sphere in the wake of catastrophic events]{.mark},
combined [with the treatment of disasters as exciting market
opportunities]{.mark}".\[]{.underline}**5\] It took place first in Chile
under the Pinochet dictatorship, but also in New Orleans following
Hurricane Katrina; in Sri Lanka after the 2004 tsunami; in Iraq after
the US invasion of 2003; in the US after the attacks of September 11,
2001; in China after Tiananmen; in 1993 under Yeltsin's Russia, and so
on. In each case, Klein explains, the attacks were led by fanatical
neoliberals who gave no quarter in their application of austerity
policies. **[[This is exactly what is]{.mark} taking place [in
Venezuela]{.mark}, [compounded by the]{.mark} fact that the
[shock]{.mark} is largely [induced by the local Venezuelan elite acting
in lockstep with US imperialism]{.mark}, each drawing on the support of
their respective social base. Fundamentally [composed of middle and
upper classes]{.mark}, the class component of the shock recalls the
history of Salvador Allende's government. In both cases, democratic
governments with a socialist orientation, elected by popular vote, are
systematically put under siege, their respective economies asphyxiated
in order to create the conditions for a violent solution that would
"neutralize" the popular classes inclined to support revolutionary
change]{.underline}**. In a recent declaration by Alfonso Guerra, the
Spanish ex-president claimed that Nicolás Maduro was comparable to the
Pinochet government -- an assertion all the more obscene for the reasons
outlined above. According to Guerra, "Venezuela is suffering under a
dictatorship that, on top of everything else, is incompetent;
dictatorships often undermine liberty, but at least they act efficiently
in the economic sphere". He then added: "There is a difference between
the horrible Pinochet dictatorship and that of Maduro: in the first, the
economy did not collapse, and in the second it did".\[6\] The current
"disaster" of the Venezuelan economy is not the work of "21st century
socialism", as the National Assembly would have it, nor the
"incompetence" of the government; instead, it is fundamentally the
handiwork of local and global capitalist powers, combined with the
political difficulties the Bolivarian Revolution faces in its attempts
to manage the conflict in favor the popular majority. Venezuela is today
suffering a textbook case of "disaster capitalism". II In the dominant
narrative, the situation in Venezuela has been interpreted as an
"emergency", but above all as a "humanitarian crisis". It will remain
for a later date to fully understand the historical conditions that have
enabled the use of the "humanitarian" concept. However, taking as a
reference point articles published in a US propaganda organ such as
Voice of America \[Voz de América\], it is possible to trace the
concept's usage back to 2014. Curiously, it first appears in connection
with the right to freedom of expression. On March 31 of that year, in
the midst of the second wave of anti-Chavista violence directed against
the Maduro government, Rodrigo Diamanti, an economist from the Catholic
University Andrés Bello and president of the NGO "A World Without
Censorship" \[Un mundo sin mordaza\], declared that the "political
crisis in Venezuela, combined with the economic and social crisis, is
fueling a humanitarian crisis".\[7\] **[Contrary to all evidence,
Diamanti stated that the government had violated the right to political
demonstration and had launched a persecutory campaign in social
networks. Throughout 2014, the "humanitarian" discourse was employed in
relation to the situation in the health sector. This time it was José
Manuel Olivares, "a medical resident at the university hospital of
Caracas and specialist in oncological radiotherapy", who spoke out
against the "humanitarian crisis that the country is currently
suffering".]{.underline}**\[8\] Voice of America failed to inform that
Olivares was then a militant with the rightwing party Primero Justicia.
In fact, he is currently a deputy in the National Assembly, elected by
the state of Vargas in the 2015 parliamentary elections, as was Deputy
Juan Guaidó. By 2015 the term had become a permanent fixture. On
February 24, the think tank "International Crisis Group" issued a report
in which it warned that Venezuela "would be facing a humanitarian crisis
if measures were not taken to solve the country's problems".\[9\] A
couple weeks later, on March 9, the Obama Administration declared
Venezuela an "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security
and foreign policy of the United States", imposing sanctions on seven
officials allegedly involved in human rights violations.\[10\] In an
article dated to March 11, José Manuel Oliveras spoke in the name of an
NGO known as "Doctors for Health" \[Médicos por la Salud\], again
asserting that the country was experiencing a "a humanitarian health
crisis". \[11\] Republican Marco Rubio weighed in with his own
declaration the next day: "while individual economic sanctions against
infractions of human rights, announced earlier this week, has focused on
the catastrophe that Nicolás Maduro and his regime have inflicted on the
Venezuelans, there must be more action and attention paid to the
humanitarian and economic crisis that threatens regional
security".\[12\] That same day, the Secretary of State John Kerry
"assured that if Venezuela were to cease its oil assistance to
neighboring countries, a humanitarian crisis could be unleashed".\[13\]
From that moment onward, the anti-Chavista voices would employ the term
with increasing frequency. By 2016, with the National Assembly under
opposition control, that institution became a sounding board for the
same kind of discourse: on January 26 it issued a statement on "the
humanitarian crisis in health in Venezuela, due to the scarcity of
medications, medical supplies and the deterioration of health
infrastructure", \[14\] while on February 11 it announced a
"humanitarian crisis and the complete absence of any form of food
security for the Venezuelan population".\[15\] On January 23, the team
at Misión Verdad published a report providing information that showed
the fallacy behind the "cartelized discourses sustaining the 'lack of
dollars' as a fundamental cause for the restriction of medication, which
is produced oligopolistically" by a handful of pharmaceutical
corporations based in the country.\[16\] On February 15, journalist
Victor Hugo Majano warned: "the National Assembly's declaration of a
dietary and pharmaceutical emergency is meant to force the government
into maintaining flows of foreign currency that are in turn used to
finance imports, typically by the commercial layer of the bourgeoisie
and transnational corporations that are dedicated to the
commercialization of consumer goods". \[17\] **[Even having only
sketched a tentative relation between the available facts, and [given
the historical conditions]{.mark} in which [this]{.mark} type [of
discourse emerges]{.mark} and the type of language it uses, not to
mention its principal motives, it [seems clear that]{.mark} when there
is talk of a "[humanitarian crisis" in Venezuela]{.mark} it [comes in
the form of a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.mark}. Those who speak a
"humanitarian" language, more than warning against what could happen,
are [anticipating a reality]{.mark} that they themselves are [deeply
invested in seeing materialized]{.mark}. Apart from that, they are
posing the problem as the exclusive responsibility of the government,
from [which can only follow a single solution: "humanitarian
intervention".]{.mark} This is critical to understand: [there is no
"crisis" without "intervention]{.mark}".]{.underline}** Another effect
is the progressive degradation of political language: the
"humanitarianization" of discourse is the most recent expression of an
attempt to dehumanize Chavismo. It is inherent to anti-Chavismo. The
"hordes" from the first years of the Bolivarian Revolution are then made
out to be criminal accomplices of a genocidal dictator, i.e. Nicolás
Maduro, who furthermore is a "usurper", like the equally "illegitimate"
Hugo Chávez. The virulence of the recent attacks against Chavismo,
regarded as a despicable and vile phenomenon subject to legitimate
extermination, does not answer to any **["humanitarian crisis": it is
the same virulence as twenty years earlier, fomented by the brutality
that is today expressed in Venezuela's "disaster capitalism". The
"[humanitarianization]{.mark}" of [political discourse]{.mark} is the
intricate plot upon which the Trump Administration looks to legitimize
their attack on the PDVSA: it is "[justified" on the grounds
that]{.mark}, as John Bolton stated on Fox Business on January 24, [the
government]{.mark} in question [is "genocidal" and "corrupt]{.mark}". So
what is the trick? The trick is [that this discursive plot serves to
muddy the waters]{.mark}: [anyone who should question]{.mark} the
humanitarian discourse [has]{.mark} simply [failed to "recognize"
or]{.mark}, worse, "[justified" the crisis]{.mark} and
corruption.]{.underline}** By the same sleight of hand, the main parties
responsible for the "catastrophe" are the ones exempt from any
responsibility. III The "humanitarian crisis" is a business opportunity,
as Bolton acknowledged in his Fox Business interview. The same
"opportunities" are also on display in the plans being promoted by the
National Assembly. On December 19, 2018, a proposal was put before the
National Assembly: the "Plan for the Country, the Day After" \[Plan
País, el día después\]. The "Plan" offers a roadmap for what is to be
expected during the "democratic transition". According to Banking and
Business \[Banca y Negocios\], the plan outlines: -- "the reactivation
of the productive apparatus \[...\] by accessing the finances of
multilateral banking", read the International Monetary Fund; -- "removal
of all controls, regulations and bureaucratic obstacles, and punitive
measures"; -- "international investment within a regulatory framework
that creates confidence and effective protection of private property";
-- "opening for private investment in public enterprises"; -- " approval
of a new Hydrocarbon Law that \[...\] would allow for private capital to
act as a majority shareholder in oil projects"; -- "the private sector
will be responsible \[...\] for the operation of utility assets"; --
"efficiency in order to reduce the size of the state". On social
matters, the proposal aims to "supply and provide continuous access to
primary goods and services, with special focus on the sectors of health,
education and nutrition for the most vulnerable, encouraging quality
employment and protection of family income".\[18\] On January 8, 2019, a
bill proposal was circulated in the National Assembly with the title
"Statute Governing the Transition to Democracy and the Reestablishment
of the Validity of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela" \[Ley de Estatuto que rige la transición a la democracia y el
restablecimiento de la vigencia de la Constitución de la República
Bolivariana de Venezuela\]. Article 21 of the bill reads: "the National
Assembly will issue the laws necessary to deal with the complex
humanitarian emergency and promote the recovery of the Venezuelan
economy, in conformity with the Agreement of Plan País approved on
December 18, 2018". The same article goes on to list the objectives it
will accomplish: "rapid economic recuperation through extraordinary
international financial assistance provided by multilateral organisms"
(paragraph 1); "centralized control, arbitrary measures for
expropriation and other similar measures will all be abolished,
including currency control. To that end, the centralized model for
economic control will be replaced by a model based on liberty and the
market, founded on the right enjoyed by each Venezuelan to work under
the guarantees based on property and freedom of enterprise" (paragraph
2); "public utilities will be subject to a process of restructuring that
assures efficient and transparent management, including through
public-private arrangements" (paragraph 4).\[19\] **[Clearly, "[Plan
País]{.mark}" and the "Transition" bill proposal [are both rife with
neoliberal measures]{.mark}: deregulation, massive privatization
(including PDVSA), restructuring of the state, etc. And as for social
concerns, given that the issue at hand is nothing less than a
"humanitarian crisis", and that the magnitude of such a crisis would
logically occupy a central place in any "democratic transition plan",
the proposed social measures are little more than a scaled-back version
of the policies implemented throughout the Bolivarian Revolution. [Such
is the deceptive nature of Venezuela's "disaster capitalists":]{.mark}
they promise to return the country to the years of Chávez, which in
their thinking was destroyed by the very same "21st century socialism";
however they also intend to apply the same neoliberal policies of the
80s and 90s, which fueled the first rebellions of the Venezuelan
people.]{.underline}**

There has been an excess of modesty in the feminist agendas of recent
decades. Carol A. [Stabile is amongst those who have been critical of an
absence of systemic thinking within postmodern feminisms, remarking upon
[a "growing emphasis on fragmentations and single-issue
politics.]{.mark}"]{.underline}1 [Stabile dismisses this kind of
thinking which, [in]{.mark} "so resolutely [avoiding
'totalizing']{.mark}]{.underline}---the bête noire of contemporary
critical theory---\[...\] [ignores or [jettisons a structural analysis
of capitalism]{.mark}."]{.underline}2 [[The difference in scope]{.mark}
and scale [between that which is being opposed and the strategies being
used to oppose it is generative of]{.mark} a sense of [disempowerment.
]{.mark}]{.underline}On the one hand, Stabile argues, [postmodern social
theorists "accept the systemic nature of capitalism, as made visible in
its consolidation of power and its global expansion]{.underline} \[...\]
[[Capitalism's power]{.mark} as a system [is therefore
identified]{.mark} and named [as a totality]{.mark}"; [on the other
hand, these theorists "celebrate local, fragmented, or partial forms of
knowledge as the only forms]{.mark} of knowledge [available" and
criticize big-picture]{.mark} speculative [thinking for its potentially
oppressive]{.mark} tendencies or [applications.]{.mark}]{.underline}3
Nancy Fraser, too, has addressed this apparent "shrinking of
emancipatory vision at the fin de siècle," linking this with "a major
shift in the feminist imaginary" during the 1980s and 1990s---that is,
with a move away from attempting to remake political economy
(redistribution) and towards an effort at transforming culture
(recognition).4 [The legacies of this kind of political
theorizing]{.underline}---legacies some might describe as "folk
political"---[are still being felt today, and continue to shape the
perceived horizons of possibility for progressive
projects.]{.underline}5 Yet [these projects]{.underline}, which are
frequently valuable, necessary, and effective on their own terms, [are
not sufficient as ends in themselves.]{.underline} To the extent that
they are conceptualized in detachment from an ecology of other
interventions, [operating via a diversity of means and across a variety
of scales, [they cannot serve as a suitable basis for any politics
seeking to contest t]{.mark}he imaginaries of the right or to contend
with [the expansive hegemonic project of neoliberal
capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is for this reason that Nick Srnicek
and Alex Williams's work positions itself as somewhat skeptical about
fragmentations and single-issue politics, pointing out that problems
such as "global exploitation, planetary climate change, rising surplus
populations, \[and\] the repeated crises of capitalism are abstract in
appearance, complex in structure, and non-localized."6 As such, a
[politics based around the ideas that "the local is ethical, simpler is
better, the organic is healthy, permanence is oppressive, and progress
is over" is not always the best weapon in an attempt to contend with the
complex technomaterial conditions of the world as it
stands.]{.underline}7 [[There is a persistent kind of abstraction
anxiety hanging over progressive politics]{.mark}; an anxiety that
haunts a contemporary leftist feminism still unwilling or unable to
critically reappraise the tendencies]{.underline} that Stabile
identified in the 90s. Recently, however, [[a renewed appetite for
ambitious and future-oriented emancipatory politics has begun to make
itself felt]{.mark} at the fringes of the left---and indeed, to gather
momentum and popular support more broadly]{.underline}.8 Perhaps [the
most remarkable example of this tendency within
philosophically-inflected political theory circles has been
[accelerationism,]{.mark} with its [calls to build an "intellectual
infrastructure" capable of "creating a new ideology, economic and social
models,]{.mark} and a vision of the good to replace and surpass the
emaciated ideals that rule our world today."]{.underline}9 These
so-called "Promethean" ideas have generated widespread interest,
arguably both reflecting and contributing to the changing tenor of
activist discourse. Interestingly, this term has to some extent emerged
in opposition to the pejorative "folk political," acting as a shorthand
for a very different set of values and perspectives. In a recent
critical piece, Alexander Galloway suggests that "Prometheanism" could
be defined as "technology for humans to overcome natural limit."10 Peter
[Wolfendale, meanwhile, sees it as a "politics of intervention"---one
that starts from the insistence that [nothing be exempted in advance
from the enactment of re/visionary processes]{.mark}.]{.underline}11

#### Avoiding institution-building abdicates the potential for communal power and reduces revolution to static bursts of energy

**Srnicek & Williams '15** (Nick, Theorist and activist, and Alex, PhD
student at the University of East London, *Inventing the Future:
Postcapitalism and a World Without Work,* ebook)

To invoke modernity is ultimately to raise the question of the future.
**[[What should the future look like?]{.mark} What courses should we
set?]{.underline}** What does it mean to be contemporary? And whose
future is it? Since the emergence of the term, modernity has been
concerned with unravelling a circular or retrospective notion of time
and introducing a rupture between the present and the past. With this
break, the future is projected as being potentially different from and
better than the past.14 Modernity is tantamount to 'the discovery of the
future' and has therefore found itself intimately linked with notions
such as 'progress, advance, development, emancipation, liberation,
growth, accumulation, Enlightenment, embetterment, \[and the\]
avant-garde'.15 Suggesting that history can progress through deliberate
human action, it is the nature of this progress that competing
definitions of modernity have struggled over.16 Historically, the left
has found its natural home in being oriented towards the future. [From
early communist visions of technological progress,]{.underline} to
Soviet space utopias, [to the social democratic rhetoric of the 'white
heat of technology', [what set the left apart from the right was
its]{.mark} unambiguous [embrace of the future]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
future was to be an improvement over the present in material, social and
political terms. By contrast, the forces of the political right were,
with a few notable exceptions, defined by their defence of tradition and
their essentially reactionary nature.17 [This situation was reversed
during the rise of neoliberalism]{.underline}, with politicians like
Thatcher commanding the rhetoric of modernisation and the future to
great effect. [[Co-opting these terms]{.mark} and mobilising them into a
new hegemonic common sense, [neoliberalism's vision of modernity has
held sway ever since]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently, discussions of
the left in terms of the future now seem aberrant, even absurd. With the
postmodern moment, the seemingly intrinsic links between the future,
modernity and emancipation were prized apart.
[[Philosophers]{.underline}]{.mark} like Simon Critchley can
[[now]{.mark} confidently [assert that 'we have to resist the idea and
ideology of the future]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is always the
ultimate trump card of capitalist ideas of progress'.18 **[[Such
folk-political sentiment]{.mark}s]{.underline}** blindly
**[[accept]{.mark} the [neoliberal common sense]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
preferring to shy away from grand visions and replace them with a
posturing resistance. [[From the radical left's discomfort with]{.mark}
technological [modernity]{.mark} to the social democratic left's
inability to envision an alternative world, [everywhere today **the
future has largely been ceded to the right**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} A
skill that the left once excelled at -- building enticing visions for a
better world -- has deteriorated after years of neglect. If the left is
to recover a sense of progress, however, it cannot simply adopt the
classic images of history headed towards a singular destination.
Progress, for these approaches, was not only possible, but in fact woven
as a necessity into the very fabric of history. Human societies were
thought to travel along a pre-defined pathway towards a single outcome
modelled after Europe. The nations of Europe were deemed to have
developed capitalist modernity independently, and their historical
experiences of development were considered to be both necessary and
superior to those of other cultures.19 Such ideas dominated traditional
European philosophy and continued on in the influential modernisation
literature of the 1950s and 1960s, with their attempts to naturalise
capitalism against a Soviet opponent.20 Partly endorsed by both early
Marxism and later Keynesian and neoliberal capitalisms, [a
one-size-fits-all model of historical progress positioned non-Western
societies as lacking and in need of development]{.underline} -- a
position that served to justify colonial and imperial practices.21 [From
the standpoint of their philosophical critics, these notions of progress
were disparaged]{.underline} precisely for their belief in preconceived
destinations -- whether in the liberal progression towards capitalist
democracy or in the Marxist progression towards communism. The complex
and often disastrous record of the twentieth century demonstrated
conclusively that history could not be relied upon to follow any
predetermined course.22 Regression was as likely as progress, genocide
as possible as democratisation.23 In other words, there was nothing
inherent in the nature of history, the development of economic systems,
or sequences of political struggle that could guarantee any particular
outcome. [From a broadly left perspective]{.underline}, for example,
[even those limited but not insignificant political gains that have been
achieved]{.underline} -- such as welfare provision, women's rights and
worker protections -- [can be rolled back.]{.underline} Moreover, even
in states where nominally communist governments took power, it proved
far more difficult than expected to transition from a capitalist system
of production to a fully communist one.24 This series of historical
experiences fuelled an internal critique of European modernity by way of
psychoanalysis, critical theory and poststructuralism. For the thinkers
of postmodernism, modernity came to be associated with a credulous
naivety.25 In Jean-François Lyotard's epochal definition, postmodernity
was identified as the era that has grown to be suspicious of the grand
metanarrative.26 On this account, postmodernity is a cultural condition
of disillusionment with the kinds of grandiose narratives represented by
capitalist, liberal and communist accounts of progress. To be sure,
these critiques capture something important about the chronological
texture of our time. And yet, the announcement of the end of grand
narratives has often been viewed by those outside Europe as being
absolutely of a piece with modernity.27 Further, with the benefit of
thirty years' hindsight, **[[the broader impact of the cultural
condition]{.underline}]{.mark}** diagnosed by Lyotard **[[has not been
the decline of belief in metanarratives]{.mark} per se,
[but]{.mark}]{.underline}** rather **[[a broad disenchantment with those
offered by the left.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The association between
capitalism and modernisation remains, while [properly progressive
notions of the future have wilted under postmodern critique and been
quashed beneath the social wreckage of neoliberalism.]{.underline} Most
significantly, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of
globalisation, history does appear to have a grand narrative.28
Throughout the world, markets, wage labour, commodities and
productivity-enhancing technologies have all expanded under the systemic
imperative to accumulate. [Capitalism has become the destiny of
contemporary societies, happily coexisting with national differences and
paying little heed to clashes between civilisations.]{.underline} But we
can draw a distinction here between the endpoint (capitalism) and the
pathway towards it. Indeed, the mutual entanglement of countries means
that the European pathway (heavily reliant on exploiting colonies and
slavery) is barred for many of the newly developing countries. While
there are broad paradigms of development, each country has had to find
its own unique way to respond to the imperatives of global capitalism.
The path of capitalist modernisation is therefore instantiated in
different cultures, following different trajectories and with different
rhythms of development.29 Uneven and combined development is the order
of the day.30 **[[Progress is]{.underline}]{.mark}** therefore **[[not
bound to a single European path, but]{.underline}]{.mark}** is instead
**[[filtered through a variety of political and cultural
constellations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, all directed towards
instantiating capitalist relations. Today, modernisers simply fight over
which variant of capitalism to install. [Recuperating the idea of
progress under such circumstances means]{.underline}, first and
foremost, [contesting the dogma of this inevitable
endpoint.]{.underline} Capitalist modernity was never a necessary
outcome, but instead a successful project driven by various classes and
a systemic imperative towards accumulation and expansion. [Various
modernities are possible, and **[new visions of the future are]{.mark}
essential** for the left.]{.underline} [Such images are **a [necessary
supplement to any transformative political
project.]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[They give a direction to political
struggles and generate a set of criteria to adjudicate which struggles
to support, which]{.underline}** movements **[to resist, what to
invent]{.underline}**, and so on. [[**In the absence of images of
progress**, there can only be **reactivity**, **defensive battles**,
**local resistance** and a **bunker mentalit**]{.mark}**y**]{.underline}
-- what we have characterised as folk politics. Visions of the future
are therefore indispensable for elaborating a movement against
capitalism. Contra the earlier thinkers of modernity, [there is no
necessity to progress]{.underline}, nor a singular pathway from which to
adjudicate the extent of development. Instead, **[[progress must be
understood as hyperstitional]{.underline}]{.mark}**: as [a kind of
fiction]{.underline}, but one [that aims to transform itself into a
truth.]{.underline} [Hyperstitions operate by catalysing dispersed
sentiment into a historical force that brings the future into
existence.]{.underline} [**[They have the temporal form of 'will have
been'.]{.underline}** **[Such hyperstitions of progress form orienting
narratives with which to navigate forward]{.underline}**]{.mark}, rather
than being an established or necessary property of the world.
**[[Progress is a matter of political struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
following no pre-plotted trajectory or natural tendency, and with no
guarantee of success. If the supplanting of capitalism is impossible
from the standpoint of one or even many defensive stances, it is because
any form of prospective politics must set out to construct the new.
Pathways of progress must be cut and paved, not merely travelled along
in some pre-ordained fashion; they are a matter of political achievement
rather than divine or earthly providence.

The problem may be summarized as follows. [Capitalism has indeed created
the conditions for general prosperity and therefore for its own
supersession. But it has also blocked, and continues to block, any hope
of realizing this transformation. [We cannot]{.mark} wait for capitalism
to transform on its own, but we also cannot [hope to progress by
appealing to some radical Outside]{.mark} or by fashioning ourselves as
militants faithful to some "event" that]{.underline} (as Badiou has it)
[would mark a radical and complete break with the given "situation" of
capitalism.]{.underline} Accelerationism rather demands a movement
against and outside capitalism---but on the basis of tendencies and
technologies that are intrinsic to capitalism. [Audre Lord famously
argued that "the master's tools will never dismantle the master's
house." But [what if the master's tools are the only ones
available?]{.mark}]{.underline} Accelerationism grapples with this
dilemma. What is the appeal of [accelerationism]{.underline} today? It
[can be understood as a response to the particular social and political
situation in which we currently seem to be trapped: that of a long-term,
slow-motion catastrophe**. [Global warming, and environmental
pollution]{.mark} and degradation, [threaten to undermine our]{.mark}
whole [mode of life.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[And this mode of life
is]{.mark} itself increasingly stressful and [precarious]{.mark}, due to
the depredations of neoliberal capitalism.]{.underline} As Fredric
Jameson puts it, [[the world today is characterized by]{.mark}
"heightened [polarization]{.mark}, increasing [unemployment, \[and\]
the]{.mark} ever more desperate [search for new]{.mark} investments and
new [markets.]{.mark}"]{.underline} These are all general features of
capitalism identified by Marx, but in neoliberal society we encounter
them in a particularly pure and virulent form. I want to be as specific
as possible in my use of the term "neoliberalism" in order to describe
this situation. I define neoliberalism as a specific mode of capitalist
production (Marx), and form of governmentality (Foucault), that is
characterized by the following specific factors: 1. The dominating
influence of financial institutions, which facilitate transfers of
wealth from everybody else to the already extremely wealthy (the "One
Percent" or even the top one hundredth of one percent). 2. The
privatization and commodification of what used to be common or public
goods (resources like water and green space, as well as public services
like education, communication, sewage and garbage disposal, and
transportation). 3. The extraction, by banks and other large
corporations, of a surplus from all social activities: not only from
production (as in the classical Marxist model of capitalism) but from
circulation and consumption as well. [[Capital accumulation
proceed]{.mark}s not only [by]{.mark} direct [exploitation]{.mark} but
also by rent-seeking, by debt collection, [and]{.mark} by outright
[expropriation]{.mark}]{.underline} ("primitive accumulation"). 4. [[The
subjection of all aspects of life to]{.mark} [the]{.mark} so-called
[discipline of the market.]{.mark} This is equivalent]{.underline}, in
more traditional Marxist terms[, to the "real subsumption" by capital of
all aspects of life: leisure as well as labor.]{.underline} Even our
sleep is now organized in accordance with the imperatives of production
and capital accumulation. 5. The redefinition of human beings as private
owners of their own "human capital." [Each person is
thereby]{.underline}, as Michel Foucault puts it, [forced to become "an
entrepreneur of himself."]{.underline} In such circumstances, we are
continually obliged to market ourselves, to "brand" ourselves, to
maximize the return on our "investment" in ourselves. There is never
enough: like the Red Queen, we always need to keep running, just to stay
in the same place. [Precarity is the fundamental condition of our lives.
All of [these processes work on a global scale]{.mark}; they extend far
beyond the level of immediate individual experience. My life is
precarious, at every moment, but I cannot apprehend the forces that make
it so. I know how little money is left from my last paycheck, but I
cannot grasp, in concrete terms, how "the economy" works. I directly
experience the daily weather, but I do not directly experience the
climate. Global warming and worldwide financial networks are examples
of]{.underline} what the ecological theorist Timothy Morton calls
[hyperobjects.]{.underline} They are phenomena that actually exist but
that "stretch our ideas of time and space, since they far outlast most
human time scales, or they're massively distributed in terrestrial space
and so are unavailable to immediate experience." Hyperobjects affect
everything that we do, but we cannot point to them in specific
instances. [The chains of causality are far too complicated and
intermeshed for us to follow.]{.underline} In order to make sense of our
condition, we are forced to deal with difficult abstractions. We have to
rely upon data that are gathered in massive quantities by scientific
instruments and then collated through mathematical and statistical
formulas but that are not directly accessible to our senses. We find
ourselves, as Mark Hansen puts it, entangled "within networks of media
technologies that operate predominantly, if not almost entirely, outside
the scope of human modes of awareness (consciousness, attention, sense
perception, etc.)." We cannot imagine such circumstances in any direct
or naturalistic way, but only through the extrapolating lens of science
fiction. [Subject to these conditions, [we live under relentless
environmental and financial assault]{.mark}.]{.underline} We continually
find ourselves in what might well be called a state of crisis. However,
this involves a paradox. [A crisis---whether economic, ecological, or
political---is a turning point, a sudden rupture, a sharp and immediate
moment of reckoning.]{.underline} But for us today, [[crisis has
become]{.mark} a [chronic]{.mark} and seemingly permanent condition. [We
live]{.mark}, oxymoronically, [in a state of perpetual]{.mark}, but
never resolved, convulsion and [contradiction. Crises]{.mark} never come
to a culmination; instead, they [are]{.mark} endlessly and indefinitely
[deferred.]{.mark}]{.underline} For instance, [[after]{.mark} the
economic collapse of [2008, the big banks were bailed out]{.mark} by the
United States government. [This allowed them to resume the]{.mark} very
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline}---the creation of arcane financial
instruments, in order to enable relentless rent-seeking---**[[that led
to the breakdown]{.mark} of the economic system [in the first
place]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The functioning of the system is
restored, but only in such a way [as to guarantee the renewal of
the]{.mark} same [crisis, on a greater scale, further down the
road.]{.mark}]{.underline} Marx rightly noted that crises are endemic to
capitalism. But far from threatening the system as Marx hoped, today
[[these crises]{.mark} actually [help it to renew]{.mark}
itself.]{.underline} As David Harvey puts it, [it is precisely
"[through]{.mark} the destruction of the achievements of preceding eras
by way of [war]{.mark}, the devaluation of assets, the degradation of
productive capacity, [abandonment and]{.mark} other forms of '[creative
destruction']{.mark}" that [capitalism creates]{.mark} "a new basis for
profit-making and [surplus absorption]{.mark}."]{.underline} What lurks
behind this analysis is the frustrating sense of an impasse. Among its
other accomplishments, [neoliberal capitalism has also robbed us of the
future. For it turns everything into an eternal present.]{.underline}
The highest values of our society---as preached in the business
schools---are novelty, innovation, and creativity. And yet these always
only result in more of the same. How often have we been told that a
minor software update "changes everything"? [Our society seems to
function]{.underline}, as Ernst Bloch once put it, [in a state of "sheer
aimless infinity and incessant changeability; where everything ought to
be constantly new, everything remains just as it was." This is because,
in our current state of affairs, [the future exists only]{.mark} in
order [to be colonized]{.mark} and made into an investment
opportunity.]{.underline} John Maynard Keynes sought to distinguish
between risk and genuine uncertainty. Risk is calculable in terms of
probability, but genuine uncertainty is not. Uncertain events are
irreducible to probabilistic analysis, because "there is no scientific
basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever." Keynes's
discussion of uncertainty has strong affinities with Quentin
Meillassoux's account of hyperchaos. For Meillassoux, there is no
"totality of cases," no closed set of all possible states of the
universe. Therefore, there is no way to assign fixed probabilities to
these states. This is not just an empirical matter of insufficient
information; uncertainty exists in principle. For Meillassoux and Keynes
alike, there comes a point where "we simply do not know." But today,
Keynes's distinction is entirely ignored. [The Black-Scholes Formula and
the Efficient Market Hypothesis both conceive the future entirely in
probabilistic terms.]{.underline} In these theories, as in the actual
financial trading that is guided by them (or at least rationalized by
them), [the genuine unknowability of the future is transformed into a
matter of calculable, manageable risk.]{.underline} True novelty is
excluded, because all possible outcomes have already been calculated and
paid for in terms of the present. While this belief in the calculability
of the future is delusional, it nonetheless determines the way that
financial markets actually work. We might therefore say that speculative
finance is the inverse---and the complement---of the "affirmative
speculation" that takes place in science fiction. Financial speculation
seeks to capture, and shut down, the very same extreme potentialities
that science fiction explores. Science fiction is the narration of open,
unaccountable futures; derivatives trading claims to have accounted for,
and discounted, all these futures already. [[The
"market]{.mark}"---]{.underline}nearly deified in neoliberal
doctrine---thus works preemptively, as a global practice of what Richard
Grusin calls premediation. It [[seeks to deplete the future in advance.
Its]{.mark} relentless [functioning makes it nearly impossible]{.mark}
for us [to conceive of any]{.mark} [alternative]{.mark} to the global
capitalist world order. Such is the condition that Mark Fisher calls
capitalist realism.]{.underline} As Fisher puts it, channeling both
Jameson and Žižek, ["it's easier to imagine the end of the world than
the end of capitalism."]{.underline}

#### The alternative is to affirm the model of the Communist Party -- only the Party can provide effective accountability mechanisms to correct chauvinist tendencies, educate and mobilize marginalized communities, and connect local struggles to a movement for international liberation

I would argue that within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing, but this trend has not always been explicitly
theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in this essay is to
argue that [[base building and dual power strategy can be best forwarded
through party organizing]{.mark}, and that [party organizing can allow
this]{.mark} emerging [movement to solidify into a powerful
revolutionary socialist tendency]{.mark} in the United
States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights of the base building
movement is that [the current state of the left in the United States is
one in which revolution is not currently possible.]{.underline} There
exists very little popular support for socialist politics. A century of
anticommunist propaganda has been extremely effective in convincing even
the most oppressed and marginalized that communism has nothing to offer
them. [The base building emphasis on dual power responds directly to
this insight. [By building institutions which can meet people's needs,
we]{.mark} are able to concretely [demonstrate that communists can
offer]{.mark} the oppressed [relief from]{.mark} the horrific conditions
of [capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline} Base building strategy recognizes
that actually doing the work to serve the people does infinitely more to
create a socialist base of popular support than electing democratic
socialist candidates or holding endless political education classes can
ever hope to do. Dual power is about proving that we have something to
offer the oppressed. The question, of course, remains: once we have
built a base of popular support, what do we do next? [If it turns out
that establishing socialist institutions to meet people's needs does in
fact create sympathy towards the cause of communism, how can we mobilize
that base?]{.underline} Put simply: **[[in order to mobilize the
base]{.mark} which base builders hope to create, [we need to have
already done the work of building a communist
party.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[It is not enough to simply meet
peoples needs. Rather, we must build the institutions of dual power in
the name of communism.]{.underline} [We must refuse covert front
organizing and instead have a public face as a communist
party.]{.underline} When we build tenants unions, serve the people
programs, and other dual power projects, we must make it clear that we
are organizing as communists, unified around a party, and are not
content simply with establishing endless dual power organizations. [We
must be clear that our strategy is revolutionary and in order to make
this clear we must adopt party organizing. By "party organizing" I mean
an organizational strategy which adopts the party model. Such organizing
focuses on building a party whose [membership is formally unified around
a party line determined by democratic centralist decision
making.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The party model creates internal methods
[for **holding party members accountable**, unifying]{.mark} party
member [action]{.mark} around democratically determined goals, [and for
educating]{.mark} party members in communist theory and
praxis.]{.underline} A communist organization utilizing the party model
works to build dual power institutions while simultaneously educating
the communities they hope to serve. [Organizations which adopt the party
model focus on propagandizing around the need for revolutionary
socialism. [They]{.mark} function as the forefront of political
organizing, [empower]{.mark}ing local [communities]{.mark} to theorize
their liberation through communist theory [while organizing communities
to]{.mark} literally [fight for their liberation.]{.mark}]{.underline} A
party is not simply a group of individuals doing work together, but is a
formal organization unified in its fight against capitalism. Party
organizing has much to offer the base building movement. By working in a
unified party, base builders can ensure that local struggles are tied to
and informed by a unified national and international strategy. While the
most horrific manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique
form at the local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is
against a material base which functions not only at the national but at
the international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus.]{.underline} Furthermore, **[[party organizing allows
for]{.mark} local organizations and individual [organizers to be held
accountable]{.mark} for their actions.]{.underline}** [[It allows
criticism to function]{.mark} not as one independent group criticizing
another independent group, but rather as comrades [with]{.mark} a formal
organizational [unity working together to sharpen]{.mark} each others
[strategies and to help correct **chauvinist** ideas and]{.mark}
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [[**accountability is
crucial**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [As a movement which operates within a
settler colonial society, [imperialist and colonial ideal frequently
infect leftist organizing. Creating formal]{.mark} unity and party
[procedure]{.mark} for dealing with and correcting these ideas [allows
us to address these consistent problems]{.mark} within American
socialist organizing.]{.underline} Having a formal party which unifies
the various dual power projects being undertaken at the local level also
allows for base builders to not simply meet peoples needs, but to pull
them into the membership of the party as organizers themselves. The
party model creates a means for sustained growth to occur by unifying
organizers in a manner that allows for skills, strategies, and ideas to
be shared with newer organizers. It also allows community members who
have been served by dual power projects to take an active role in
organizing by becoming party members and participating in the continued
growth of base building strategy. It ensures that there are formal
processes for educating communities in communist theory and praxis, and
also enables them to act and organize in accordance with their own local
conditions. We also must recognize that the current state of the base
building movement precludes the possibility of such a national unified
party in the present moment. Since base building strategy is being
undertaken in a number of already established organizations, it is not
likely that base builders would abandon these organizations in favor of
founding a unified party. Additionally, it would not be strategic to
immediately undertake such complete unification because it would mean
abandoning the organizational contexts in which concrete gains are
already being made and in which growth is currently occurring. What is
important for base builders to focus on in the current moment is
building dual power on a local level alongside building a national
movement. This means aspiring towards the possibility of a unified
party, while pursuing continued local growth. The movement within the
Marxist Center network towards some form of unification is positive step
in the right direction. The independent party emphasis within the
Refoundation caucus should also be recognized as a positive approach. It
is important for base builders to continue to explore the possibility of
unification, and to maintain unification through a party model as a long
term goal. In the meantime, [individual base building [organizations
ought to adopt party models]{.mark} for their local organizing. Local
organizations ought to be building dual power [alongside
recruitment]{.mark} into their organizations, [education]{.mark} of
community members [in communist theory and praxis, and the establishment
of]{.mark} armed and [militant party cadres capable of defending]{.mark}
dual power [institutions from state terror.]{.mark}]{.underline} Dual
power institutions must be unified openly and transparently around these
organizations in order for them to operate as more than "red charities."
Serving the people means meeting their material needs while also
educating and propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and
organizing. [[**The party model** remains the most useful method for
achieving these ends.]{.mark}]{.underline} The use of the party model by
local organizations allows base builders to gain popular support, and
most importantly, to mobilize their base of popular support towards
revolutionary ends, not simply towards the construction of a parallel
economy which exists as an end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we
will see future unification of the various local base building
organizations into a national party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we
must push for party organizing at the local level. If local
organizations adopt party organizing, [it ought to become clear
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[a unified national party will]{.mark}
have to [be the long term goal]{.mark} of the base building
movement.]{.underline}** Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism. The
long term details of base building and dual power organizing will arise
organically in response to the conditions the movement finds itself
operating within. [I hope that I have put forward a useful contribution
to the discussion about base building organizing, and have demonstrated
the need for party organizing in order to ensure that the base building
tendency maintains a revolutionary orientation.]{.underline} The finer
details of revolutionary strategy will be worked out over time and are
not a good subject for public discussion. I strongly believe party
organizing offers the best path for ensuring that such strategy will
succeed. My goal here is not to dictate the only possible path forward
but to open a conversation about how the base building movement will
organize as it transitions from a loose network of individual
organizations into a unified socialist tendency. These discussions and
debates will be crucial to ensuring that this rapidly growing movement
can succeed.

misinterpretation is an [effect of the **erasure of the division**
necessary for politics]{.mark} as if interest and will were only and

a consequence, sceptics neglect the performative component of the
first-person plural, overlooking the point where, as Žižek puts it,
'objective social analysis breaks down and a subjective political
attitude directly inscribes itself' (2010: 203). The power of Occupy, a
power expressed in the slogan, 'We are the 99 per cent,' arose out of
such a direct inscription of a political attitude, the inscription of a
political subject. No one thought that 99 per cent of the people in the
US were actually saying 'we'. The slogan was not an empirical claim; it
was a political representation. For some in Occupy, often but not always
adopting an anarchist position, 'we' is a problem because it posits an
impossible unity. [They assume that first-person plural statements imply
uniformity across the entirety of the grou]{.underline}p (and here they
sneak in some of their sceptical allies' reductive empiricism, as if
groups or collectives designated via the first-person plural were
necessary outgrowths of fixed social positions). [This argument is weak

difference]{.underline} (Dean 1996). [That we differ and disagree

all the same or that 'we' always agree]{.underline}. Unfortunately, some
individualist tendencies in the occupation movement failed to recognise
that 'we' can and always does include difference and so needlessly
fetishised an individualism belied by the collective power at the heart
of Occupy Wall Street. [A basic tenet of psychoanalysis is that [the

#### There is a unique stasis for change now that only grows greater with time 

**Herod 08** (The Anarchist Libarary, A Goal and Strategy for Anarchy,
James Herod joined the struggle against capitalists, politicians, and
priests (or, to use the abstractions, capital, state, and god) during
the social upheavals of 1968 and has remained in it ever since.

**Wolfy UwU**

[It should be quite obvious, but apparently it's not, that we can't
devise an anarchist revolutionary strategy until we have a clear idea of
what it is we're trying to achieve.]{.underline} Regrettably, there has
been a vigorous ban on thinking about the future society we want, a ban
that has been more or less effectively imposed for nearly one hundred
and fifty years. [Marx is largely responsible for this. He refused to
discuss in concrete detail what he thought a communist society would
look like, what social forms it would take.]{.underline} He said it
would be up to the people making the revolution to work that out.
Additionally, he derided as "utopian" socialist thinkers who were trying
to think this through (e.g., Charles Fourier and Robert Owen). Given the
long-lasting hegemony of Marxism on the left this label has stuck. To
this day pe m ople refer to Fourier as a "utopian socialist." So also
has the ban stuck until quite recently, when the hegemony of
Marxism-Leninism was finally broken. Recently, at least in USAmerica,
two other political currents have joined the ban on thinking about the
future society, Primitivism and Postmodernism. Primitivists define the
enemy as civilization, and are hoping that it will collapse; they do
whatever they can to hasten this. As for what happens next, they offer
some vague and romantic notions about everyone returning to live in
hunting and gathering tribes; but for the here and now, they have no
political program for improving society. In fact, they casually
contemplate the extermination of most people on earth, nearly six
billion people, because that is what would happen if agriculture were
abandoned. As for Postmodernists, they are good at deconstructing, and
in strengthening anti-foundationalism, which can be useful, but they
refuse to engage in constructive efforts to improve the world. They have
no political program. Thus their philosophy has neutered them and
rendered them impotent. They become apolitical and useless in the
struggle for liberation. [This lack of attention to the goal is a
tragedy, because although it's true that we live in potentially
calamitous times, what with peak oil, climate warming, and the more
general crisis of capitalism, we also live in exciting times. A window
of opportunity has opened up to create at long last a decentered world,
without capitalism, states, or god, a world of democratic autonomous
communities. There are at least two important reasons for this opening.
One is the near total collapse of the prevailing social philosophies
which have underpinned capitalism to date. Conservatism is dead, as is
liberalism. The counterparts of these philosophies on the left are also
dead and gone, namely, Leninism and Social Democracy. All these
ideologies were more or less destroyed in the great revolts of the
1960s. Into the vacuum stepped neoliberalism, a reversion to nineteenth
century unfettered capitalism, or capitalism without the smokescreen,
where profit-taking trumps all.]{.underline} In addition to all the
inherent contradictions of a system based on the accumulation of capital
for its own sake, now capitalists are having to function without a
veneer. The so-called war on terror is a poor substitute for a
full-fledged social ideology. That they are trying to rely on such a
shoddy idea to justify profit-mongering is a sign of their desperation.
And when capitalists have to start commodifying water, seeds, genes,
wind, sunshine, libraries, hospitals, parks, roads, thought, and
emotions, in order to keep the profits rolling in, maybe they are
beginning to scrape the bottom of the barrel. Neoliberalism this second
time around through these past forty years has exposed as probably
nothing else could have the absolutely destructive, vicious, murderous,
immoral, and insane nature of the practices of capitalists. [A second
and perhaps more important reason for this historical opening is the
possible demise of capitalism itself. At least one eminent
anti-capitalist scholar, Immanuel Wallerstein, believes that world
capitalism has reached its limits, and faces structural restraints that
it will not be able to overcome.]{.underline} He believes we are
entering a period of chaos, a time of transition between capitalism and
whatever comes next.\[1\] Whether he is right or not I guess only time
will tell. But at the very least, we know that the century of the
USAmerican Empire is coming to an end, and that even if capitalism
survives there will be a period of confusion before a new hegemon can
establish itself. [There was a similar opening at the end of feudalism.
Feudalism,]{.underline} as a system for extracting the surplus wealth of
the laboring classes, was beginning to fail. The ruling classes were in
a panic. But they rallied and created a new system, capitalism, which
enabled them to keep their wealth and power, and stay in control[.
Nevertheless, during this interregnum, the oppressed classes came closer
than they ever had before, or ever have since, to casting off their
oppressors.\[2\] And so there is an opening, an opening for anarchy.
Anarchism still stands as a living, viable, vibrant social philosophy,
with a deep, rich tradition. Anarchism is finally back on the agenda,
back in the political arena, thankfully, and not a moment too soon
either.]{.underline} But the time is now, during the next ten, twenty,
or thirty years. [This is our chance. There is no more postponing; no
more putting it off to the next generation; no more excuses for not
knowing what we want; no more saying that it is up to those in the
future who will be making the revolution to work out the details. We are
the revolutionaries!]{.underline} If we don't know now what we want,
when will we ever? This is a terrible responsibility, but it is also a
rare and exciting opportunity. [We could be the generation that finally
brings down capitalism and creates a decent, sustainable, humane, just,
free, and joyful world.]{.underline}

[Fortunately for us, anarchy, humanity, and the world, many anarchists
pretty much ignored the ban on imagining the future.]{.underline} Peter
[Kropotkin wrote]{.underline} detailed empirical studies, infused with
history and theory, about [how we might better arrange ourselves
socially.]{.underline} These studies present a picture of human life so
at odds with contemporary realities and the dominant culture as to
practically stun the reader. [Kropotkin was not alone, however. Almost
from the first emergence of anarchism as a distinct social philosophy,
with William Godwin, anarchists have been trying to imagine the future.
James Guillame, from Bakunin's circle, wrote a nice little essay on
Social Organization in 1876.]{.underline} The anarcho-syndicalists,
through nearly a century of struggle, produced an enormous literature on
workers' control and worker self-management. There is an enormous
literature on communalism, communes, and intentional communities. There
is a small but important literature on direct democracy. The Spanish
revolutionaries, standing on fifty years of organizing, which was imbued
with ideas from Bakunin, Kropotkin, and French anarcho-syndicalism,
wrote detailed plans for what they wanted, plans which covered
everything \-- workplaces, public services, agriculture, and town and
village self-government. We have the literature on the Paris Commune, on
the San-Culottes in the French Revolution, on the Ukrainian Makhnovist
movement, and on the direct democracies of medieval towns. Recently,
there has been a rash of uprisings based on Popular Assemblies in
Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, and Mexico. And so on, down through the
past two hundred years.\[3\] In 1997, Ken Knabb wrote up a good
description of all this in his book The Joy of Revolution. [Takis
Fotopoulos has mapped out, in concrete detail, what we want in his book
Towards an Inclusive Democracy]{.underline}, as well as in numerous
essays. Murray Bookchin has a short book on Remaking Society. Cornelius
Castoriadis was perhaps the greatest contemporary philosopher of
autonomy (see, for example, Philosophy, Politics, Autonomy). John
Holloway has brilliantly explained the philosophical foundations for a
free people in his book Change the World Without Taking Power. Colin
Ward brought anarchy down to earth in his book Anarchy in Action. There
are dozens of other attempts. [We don't have to rely just on theorists
from modern anarchism]{.underline}, however. [We can look back in
history]{.underline}. There were [enormous peasant revolts in early
modern Europe]{.underline}. What did they want? [They wanted to get the
ruling classes off their backs and to live free and autonomous in their
villages]{.underline}. This was no new thing either. As recently
researched and superbly described by David Graeber,\[4\] from the
emergence of the first states, whenever there was the slightest crack in
the structure of power, people tried to get free and reestablish control
over their own lives in their local communities. People have always
gathered in assemblies in their tribes and villages whenever they had
the chance to cooperatively govern their own social lives. Actually
then, we are not in trouble at all as regards the goal. There is no
reason for us to be confused or apologetic about what we want. There is
a solid historical consensus on what we want. We want to get the ruling
classes off our backs. We don't want to be exploited or alienated. We
don't want to be slaves. We want to be a self-governing people, free and
autonomous. [The idea of self-government implies assemblies, and always
has: workers' councils, town meetings, household cooperatives. We can
summarize and synthesize this as follows: Neighborhood Assemblies
Workplace Assemblies Household Assemblies An Association of Neighborhood
Assemblies That's it. That's how we do it. This is a simple and elegant
vision of how we can reorder our social lives. These social forms, in
varying mixes and degrees, have been present in just about every revolt
against oppressing classes from the dawn of hierarchical society. The
goal implies the strategy. We must establish these assemblies, in every
neighborhood, workplace, and household (much extended households
though). There is great power in social organization. Revolution means
rearranging ourselves socially. The beauty of this plan is that the
social forms which will enable us to defeat capitalists are the very
same forms that we will need to establish the society we want**. In the
process of gutting capitalism we will be creating anarchy at the same
time**. These social forms will enable us to escape wage-slavery and
embed ourselves instead in cooperative labor. They will enable us to get
out of commodity markets and build a world based on mutual aid and gift
giving. They will enable us to become a self-governing people, free and
autonomous in our local communities, and to establish an association of
such communities. This is a plausible, realistic strategy. You see, it
is **not enough to seize the means of production**. We must take all
decision making away from the capitalist ruling class and relocate it
into our assemblies. To do so we must shift the focus of our attention
to these three strategic sites, and away from protest politics, identity
politics, labor unions, and single issue campaigns, which are not
getting us very far toward defeating capitalists and establishing
anarchy.]{.underline}

#### The two step or vanguard system DOESN'T WORK; its out dated and inifecent, anarchism is then only way to sucfully size the means of productions and relocate power to workers consules

**Wolfy UwU**

Let's review now the strategies that have been used so far to get out of
capitalism and into a freer society. [By the way, in the nineteenth
century there was broad agreement among anti-capitalist activists,
whether marxist or anarchist, that "communism" meant a society without a
state.]{.underline} [That is, the original meaning of communism was
communalism or local community autonomy. A disagreement emerged,
however, about how to achieve it.]{.underline} The split between Marx
and Bakunin (marxists versus anarchists) in 1872 at the Hague Congress
of the International Workingmen's Association solidified this
disagreement. [Marxists thought that we could use the state to get to
communism]{.underline}. First capture the state, and then use it to get
to communism. [Anarchists said no, that this wouldn't work]{.underline},
and that we had to bypass the state entirely and work directly for a
stateless society. [The two-stage strategy,]{.underline} as it came to
be called, of the statists, as they came to be called[, had two
wings]{.underline}: [Leninists (Bolsheviks]{.underline}) who believed in
seizing the state in an armed revolution led by a vanguard party, [and
Kautskyists (social democrats]{.underline}) who believed in capturing
the state through elections using mass-based working-class parties[.
Both these strategies proved incapable of getting rid of
capitalism]{.underline} through nearly a century of trials. Leninist
vanguard parties came to power in countries all over the third world,
beginning with Russia, and nowhere was capitalism destroyed. Similarly,
Kautskyan social democratic parties gained control of numerous European
governments, sometimes for decades, and capitalism went rolling on. The
two-stage strategy was hegemonic on the left for nearly a century.
[Nevertheless, an anarchist strategy, anarcho-syndicalism, based on
federated workers' councils, managed to survive as a weak marginalized
alternative.]{.underline} [The idea here was to seize the means of
production, establish workers' councils, and federate these councils
into a dual power structure which could then destroy the state and
capitalism]{.underline}. Aspects of this strategy appeared in most
European revolutions throughout the twentieth century -- Russia in 1905
and 1917, Germany and Austria in 1918-1919, Spain in 1936, Hungary in
1956, France in 1968, Portugal in 1974-75, and Poland in 1980-81. This
anarcho-syndicalist strategy has also failed to unseat capitalism, and
should no longer serve as a model for us. [There are remnant groups
still pushing these failed two-stage strategies in most
countries]{.underline}. In [the United States, for example, the
Revolutionary Communist Party and the International Socialist
Organization still believe in building a vanguard party (their own
party, of course) to seize the state by force of arms.]{.underline} The
Democratic Socialists of America are representative of the moribund
social democratic strategy.

#### Literally everything else fails, no I'm not joking

**Herod 08** (The Anarchist Libarary, A Goal and Strategy for Anarchy,

**Wolfy UwU**

Let me focus now more closely just on anarchist strategies, that is,
anti-statist strategies. I'll do this by briefly surveying the various
anarchist tendencies in the United States and teasing out the strategy
implications of their beliefs. [We might categorize contemporary
USAmerican anarchist currents as follows:]{.underline} 1.
[Anarcho-Syndicalism]{.underline}, Anarcho-Communism, and Cousins:
Workers' Solidarity Alliance; Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the
World); Northeastern Federation of Anarchist Communists; Situationists;
Grassroots Economic Organizing and the Cooperative Commonwealth. 2.
[Libertarian Municipalism.]{.underline} 3. [Major Related
Tendencies]{.underline}: Surrealism; Autonomous Marxism; Libertarian
Socialism. 4[. Individualists: Primitivists]{.underline}; Ontological
Anarchism; Crimethinc; So-called Post-Left Anarchism. 5.
[Other]{.underline}: Radical Democracy; Co-Housing; Intentional
Communities; Global Justice Movement.\[5\] [If we survey all these
various currents with an eye for the strategy recommended by each, the
picture is pretty bleak]{.underline}. The Workers' Solidarity Alliance
([WSA) remains]{.underline} an orthodox anarcho-syndicalist organization
with a strict [focus on workplace organizing]{.underline}, with the
100-year-old vision of federated workers' councils as the social
organization to replace capitalism. Similarly with the Industrial
Workers of the World (Wobblies), [whose strategy hasn't changed since
its founding in 1905]{.underline}. It believes in industrial democracy
(workers' control), to be achieved through One Big Union. The Northeast
Federation of Anarchist Communists ([NEFAC]{.underline}) is more
[typically anarcho-communist]{.underline} in that it embraces both
workplace and community organizing, with a [heavy emphasis]{.underline}
though [on]{.underline} the need for a strong [anarchist
organization]{.underline} to prepare the way [for
revolution]{.underline}. Spain is probably the preferred model here,
considering that it was the main revolution that was based partly on the
ideas of Bakunin and Kropotkin, and not merely on French
anarcho-syndicalism. [Situationism]{.underline} (a French movement which
inspired in part the uprisings in Paris in 1968) is [no longer a living
current]{.underline}, of course, and survives only through isolated
individuals. However, Ken Knabb, a USAmerican representative of the
tendency, has written a nice synthesis of the workplace and community
focuses in his Joy of Revolution. But not a great deal is said about how
to get there. The group that puts out the [Grassroots Economic
Organizing Newsletter]{.underline}, which focuses on worker owned
businesses, admits that this current has [failed so far to even try to
embed itself in a larger movement to transform society]{.underline}. And
when they do speak of such a transformation they think in terms of
establishing a cooperative commonwealth, which will be legislated into
existence, after a new progressive party wins control of the government.
[Libertarian Municipalism]{.underline}, the strategy which Murray
Bookchin [attempted to launch, never caught on.]{.underline} It proposed
the take-over of local governments, by winning elections, to be
thereafter transformed into popular assemblies based on direct democracy
which would then seize control of the economy. Struggles at the
workplace were left out of the strategy. As far as I know, no group in
the country is using this strategy. Of the major related tendencies
(within social anarchism, broadly defined) -- su[rrealism, autonomous
marxism, and libertarian socialism -- none have advanced a clear picture
of the goal,]{.underline} in terms of the social forms that will replace
capitalism, and consequently none talk much about strategy. To the
extent that they do, it is probably the anarcho-syndicalist strategy
that informs the discussion. Coming now to the Individualists --
[Primitivism, Ontological Anarchism, Crimethinc, and so-called Post-Left
Anarchism]{.underline} -- [none have advanced, and all deny the need
for, a concrete description of the kind of society we are trying to
establish in the here and now]{.underline}. Since they tend to think of
society as an aggregate of autonomous individuals, they resist any
effort to define, in concrete terms, the social forms that anarchy will
take. They don't even believe in social forms. Consequently, in terms of
strategy, they are limited to attacking the existing order. That's their
strategy: resist, subvert hierarchy, get off the grid and live free
(defined in a very superficial way, however -- like, quit your job), and
attack, attack, attack. And that's what they do -- protest and disrupt.
There are some other on-the-ground developments, like co-housing and
intentional communities, neither of which, at present, are
anti-capitalist (in the main). They do not see themselves as part of a
larger movement to transform society. Each project in these currents
remains more or less isolated. The Global Justice Movement is infused
with anarchist themes and practices, but, contrary to its claim that
'There Is An Alternative,' it has not yet been able to clearly
articulate this alternative and build a strategy based on it, or so it
seems. There is an international journal, the International Journal of
Inclusive Democracy, which has articulated, in concrete detail, a clear
image of the liberated society we so ardently desire, as well as a
strategy for achieving it. But there are only a few individuals in the
United States who are associated with this intellectual current. And,
sad to say, it is very far from becoming a living current within the
contemporary anarchist movement. [So that's it \-- a very grim picture
indeed as regards a goal and strategy for anarchy among contemporary
anarchists.]{.underline}

**Wolfy UwU**

[If we look now at the actual practices which prevail in the present day
anarchist movement in USAmerica we can notice a curious fact. The
strategies described above have almost no bearing on contemporary
practices.]{.underline} [Even for class-struggle anarchists who are
oriented toward the working class and believe in workers councils, like
those associated with the Wobblies, Nefac, or the WSA, the drive for
such councils is almost nonexistent. Instead, they engage in standard
labor practices: campaigns for the right to organize, union organizing
drives, fights for better wages, hours, and benefits, or in defense of
fired workers.]{.underline} What else? By [participating in Food Not
Bombs, we anarchists take on the task of feeding the hungry, whereas we
should be devoting our time and energy to destroying a system that
creates hungry people.]{.underline} [We cannot stop all the crimes of
capitalists, one crime at a time. Their crimes are endless. We must stop
capitalists]{.underline}. [Bikes Not Bombs perhaps highlights an
alternative to the car culture, but it doesn't hurt capitalists in the
least. No number of Critical Mass bike rides will defeat the oil/car
oligarchy. Anarchist Black Cross is certainly a decent, humane project,
but no amount of letter writing to prisoners, or packets of books, will
bring down the prison-industrial complex]{.underline}. Single-issue
campaigns, like shutting down animal testing labs, in defense of animal
rights, are eminently worthy. But we could close every lab in the world
and capitalists will not be much fazed. A[nd why these? Why focus on
hungry people, cars, prisoners, or animals? Why not war, a stupendously
destructive crime, or torture, an absolute abomination?]{.underline} Or
why not agri-business and the food processing industry? [Processed
foods, and the resulting obesity and malnutrition, are killing more
people now than most major diseases]{.underline}. This is a crime of
enormous impact, as is the neoliberal destruction of food security the
world over, which has now placed about two billion people at risk from
starvation. [What about all the time, energy, and resources we devote to
running bookstores and organizing anarchist book fairs? These projects
are a tiny hedge against capitalist cultural hegemony, and help keep an
opposition movement alive, but how serious a threat are they, really, to
capitalists?]{.underline} And what about all the effort going into race,
gender, and sex issues, hardly any of which is linked to class analysis
or class struggle? Has forty years of identity politics moved us any
closer to defeating the capitalist ruling class? [Then there are the
endless marches and rallies, which have virtually no effect on
capitalists. The ruling class is laughing at us. If all we can do is
rally and march and protest in the streets, they have nothing at all to
worry about. It seems that a much more critical evaluation of our
projects is called for. We need to seriously and persistently ask
whether our projects are hurting capitalists in significant and
permanent ways, and more particularly, whether they are taking any
decision making away from the ruling class.]{.underline}

[It is time for a new tack.]{.underline} The two-stage strategy of
seizing the state, used by both Leninists and Social Democrats, as a way
of getting out of capitalism and then to communism (defined as a
stateless society, that is, anarchy), is a proven failure. Similarly,
the strict focus on workplaces and workers' control has also proved
inadequate to the task. [We need to seize everything, by establishing
direct democracy everywhere, through face-to-face assemblies, in our
neighborhoods, workplaces, and households. This is our best
hope.]{.underline} Our immediate problem is how we can get to the point
of being able to set up these assemblies. It certainly seems more or
less impossible at present, at least in the United States. But we're not
even working on it, not even trying. It's not even on the agenda. [We
first of all have to get the idea into the air. Then maybe we could
begin to see how it would be possible. It might also help us to move in
this direction if we get rid of the idea that it is the job of
anarchists to organize other people (for example, workers) to make the
revolution. In fact, we can assert an opposing idea, as the first
principle of an anarchist revolutionary strategy: Fight First for Your
Own Liberation. Not you individually, of course, but you with neighbors
and co-workers. Get together with friends, wherever you are, and start a
fight with the ruling class. Stop trying to assist others to get free,
no matter whom -- workers, women, blacks, gays, natives, immigrants --
and fight to get free yourself, within your own immediate social
setting.]{.underline} What we most urgently need to do is shift the
location of the anti-capitalist fight to the three strategic sites
described above. [We also need to scour the world for existing struggles
on these sites, then study and publicize them. Only in this way will we
start winning, and start destroying the world we hate and creating the
world we want.]{.underline}

### Pluralism Good

#### **Pluralism is key---focusing on any one strategy fails and results in leftist infighting that destroys coalitions**

**Gelderloos 07** (Peter Gelderloos is
a[narchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist) activist and
writer, 2007, "Insurrection vs Organization", The Anarchist Library,

pages 3-5, Accessed 7-15-19)//sjp

Fortunately, most anarchists in the US avoid any ideological orthodoxy
and shun sectarian divides. [Unfortunately, most of us also seem to
avoid serious strategizing. Those who do take this on tend more towards
one or another orthodoxy, and reading the pages of the country's
anarchist journals an outsider would get the impression that the
movement here is indeed sectarian]{.underline}. I[n fact there are many
controversies, and no clear tectonic splits, but one divide that is
growing more sharp is the same one that runs through much of Europe, the
debate between insurrection and organization. The former overlap with
postLeftist anarchists, the latter are often
anarchist-communists]{.underline}. Here in Greece, where I've spent the
past couple weeks, the divide is very strong between insurrectionary
anarchists associated with the Black Bloc, and the heavily organized
Antiauthoritarian Movement (AK, in Greek). [In this and most other
controversies I see anarchists becoming embroiled in, there seems to be
a lingering affinity for certain Western values that are at the heart of
the state and capitalism: a worldview based on dichotomies, and a
logical structure that is startlingly monotheistic. For example, when
there are two different strategies for revolution, many of us do not see
this as two paths for different groups of people to walk, taking their
own while also trying to understand the path of the Other, but as
evidence that somebody must be Wrong (and it is almost certainly the
Other). Those of us who were raised with white privilege were trained to
be very bad listeners, and it's a damn shame that we still haven't
absorbed the emphasis on pluralism taught by the Magonistas and
indigenous anarchists]{.underline}. I would love to blame our current
disputes on the internet, because clearly it's so easy to be an asshole
to somebody and sabotage any healthy, two-way conversation of
differences if you've already abstracted them to words on a glowing
screen, but schisms are much older than telecommunications (though no
doubt our heavy reliance on the internet makes it more likely that
disagreements will turn into counterproductive squabbles). Call me naive
but I think that a large part of the infighting can be chalked up to bad
communication and a fundamentally monotheistic worldview more than to
the actual substance of the differing strategies. No doubt, the
substance is important. There are for example some necessary critiques
of how the Left manages rebellion that have been circulated by (I
hesitate to use easy labels but for convenience sake I'll call them:)
insurrectionary anarchists, but even if certain people have figured out
all the right answers nothing will stop them from going the way of the
first anarchist movement if we don't all learn better ways of
communicating, and understanding, our differences. In Greece, the schism
between insurrectionists and the Antiauthoritarian Movement has even led
to physical fighting. There are people on both sides who have done
fucked up things. The Black Bloc threw some molotovs at police in the
middle of a melee, burning some of the protestors. People with AK
bullied and beat up anarchists whom they suspected of stealing some
computers from the university during an event AK organized, getting them
in trouble. In response, some insurrectionists burned down the
Antiauthoritarian Movement's offices in Thessaloniki. If we generalize,
the stereotypes quickly step in to assure us that the other side is the
enemy: "those disorganized insurrectionists are even throwing molotovs
at other protestors!" or "those organizationalists are acting like the
police of the movement." [In each case, we can quickly see a
preconstructed image of the lazy, chaotic insurrectionist, or the
practically Marxist authoritarian so-called anarchist, and what we're
doing is abstracting the actual people involved. I don't want to suggest
that certain or all of these groups don't have serious flaws they need
to work on. I don't even believe both sides are equally to blame. In
fact I tend to get into pretty nasty throw-downs myself with people who
prefer some bullshit, hippy "I'm okay, you're okay, everyone's okay"
form of conflict resolution that avoids criticism in favour of an
appearance of peace]{.underline}. But in Thessaloniki and Athena I met
people from both sides, and most of them were very nice, people whom I
would love to have as neighbors after we smashed the state together.
[Some of them badmouthed the other group, some of them were really
trying to make peace, also talking critically to members of their own
group who had wronged someone from the other side. On the whole, though,
they are a minority, and the divide grows]{.underline}. Posters for a
presentation I was giving in Athena got ripped down because the social
center hosting me was associated with AK (though the people actually
organizing the event and putting me up were not members, and tried to
stay in the middle). [The squat I stayed at in Thessaloniki was occupied
by people aligned with the insurrectionists, and several of them told me
not to mix with the AK people in Athena.]{.underline}

[We found that political identities were constituted through the
everyday practices of doing activism in particular projects and
campaigns, rather than political identities pre-existing fully formed
(see Laclau and Mouffe 1985). Rather than a constraint, this fluid
co-production was seen as an opportunity that allowed ideas and
identities to develop organically and to avoid dogmatic, antistate
approaches (see Holloway 2002).]{.underline} [Many people we spoke to
expressed how they valued embracing a mixture of influences, constantly
evaluating the usefulness of ideas as they are encountere]{.underline}d.
Thus for Larch from Lammas: Like being vegan or whatever, you take it on
board -- those ideas -- and then you absorb it and it mixes with lots of
other ideas -- so for me anarchism now mixes with Buddhism and Taoism
and permaculture -- a whole range of other ideas and also realism.
[Rather than creating an unfocused and unmanageable menagerie, this
diversity gave participants strength and confidence that they would not
be stuck with certain ways of organising, nor block off new ideas or
tactics that might make projects stronger]{.underline}. [When
participants did express clear political values, they were usually only
given real meaning through practice.]{.underline} As one participant
from a social centre commented: Say we all passed a resolution saying
that we are now against capitalism, which I always assumed I was, what
the fuck does that mean? I am an anti-capitalist, I will completely say
this now right, but I have no idea what that means; I have no little
blue plan in my bedroom about how society should be run. It is
meaningless; it is like, what we do now basically. (Jim, Leeds) In one
social centre, for example, a poster advertising a demonstration against
the G8 summit in Scotland in 2005 was put up with the slogan 'smash
capitalism' and by the evening it had been removed by one participant
who said they didn't want people coming to an evening gig getting the
wrong idea about the centre. Other social centres have recently had
difficult discussions about what groups could and could not use the
building. [In one, a Cuban delegation was denied access because of the
concerns over the hierarchical nature of the Cuban revolution, while in
another the participation of an anti-fascist group was questioned due to
their support of street violence (although ultimately allowed
access).]{.underline} [It is the fluidity and immediacy of these kinds
of decisions that allow political identities to take shape through
everyday practice]{.underline}

established over the last few years by geographers]{.underline} (see
Leitner et al. 2008; Juris 2008; Routledge and Cumbers 2008; Doherty et
al. 2007; Glassman 2002; Featherstone 2003 2008; Routledge 2003;
Halfacree 2006; Chatterton 2005; Pickerill 2007; Routledge et al. 2007).
Moreover, there is a growing literature evaluating particular activists'
innovations, involving hacklabs, free schools, alternative currencies,
eco-build techniques and protest camps (Seyfang 2009; Wall 2005; North
2007). These practices are often examined as elements of post-capitalist
worlds, niche ideas with potential to grow. But what is still missing
are detailed empirical accounts of the messy, gritty and real everyday
rhythms as activists envision, negotiate, build and enact life beyond
the capitalist status quo in the everyday. [This works in multiple ways
as we discuss below. Katz's (2004) work highlighting resilience,
reworking and resistance is informative here to understand the multiple
levels through which everyday activist practices are built.]{.underline}
First, resilience evokes a need to struggle against adverse situations
and to develop ways of coping with this adversity and future shocks and
crises and a desire to protect, sustain and nurture communities, their
people and their infrastructures. [Second, '\[p\]rojects of reworking
tend to be driven by explicit recognitions of problematic conditions and
to offer focused, often pragmatic, responses to them' (Katz 2004,
247)]{.underline}. Finally, resistance invokes a more oppositional
consciousness. Looking at these together, we can see a complex set of
processes at work here as participants in the projects we engaged with
simultaneously try to create resilient support mechanisms, retool
themselves as political actors to build a better world, as well as
materially resist various inequalities to actually improve their lives
and those of others. Groups prioritised different aspects within their
everyday lives, as we discuss below Most groups we encountered attached
importance to group sustenance and nurturing capabilities, in effect
developing resilience, empathy and coping skills that build community as
a bedrock for more oppositional identities and actions (see hooks 2004).
[Much of this was done through a commitment to principles such as
collectivism, selfmanagement and consensus as guides for everyday
activity and the development of a soft infrastructure of interpersonal
communications through workshops in consensus decisionmaking,
facilitation and conflict resolution. This was no easy process and there
was often both confusion and problems in terms of
implementation.]{.underline} [This approach often relied on anarchist
interpretations of collectivism and the ultimate benign qualities of
human nature; the belief that society will be bettered through the
achievement of collective goals rather than individual aspirations; and
subsequently the importance of building a commons, managed by those who
depended on the given resource (see De Angelis 2007). Implicit here are
numerous assumptions, underlying principles and implications that were
rarely interrogated, in particular broader questions such as what would
a society built on direct democracy actually mean in practice across all
spheres of life?]{.underline} Social centres went to great lengths to
embed tools for direct democracy into their meetings. Many had drawn on
formal training to help them with the practicalities of running groups
using consensus. [But there was usually not enough time devoted to
making connections between the use of these methods and what this meant
for the wider political orientation of the group. For example, it was
rarely asked why these kinds of organising principles were used over
more conventional ones, what this meant for shaping the values and
activities of the group, and how they would connect with other groups.
As a result, issues such as unequal power relations, individualism and
informal hierarchies, the function of sharing and cooperation in social
relationships and exchange, and meeting fatigue were under scrutinised
or left to fester.]{.underline} On one level this is entirely
understandable, given that most people enter political projects with
little previous understanding or experience of direct forms of
democratic management, or time in their daily lives to fundamentally
question the way our institutions and social relationships are ordered.
[However, in the case of LIDs, residents at Green Hill attempted to
tackle some of these issues by introducing formal 'feelings' sharing and
reflection time to air grievances prior to the practical discussions;
'it's a sign that we haven't had enough meetings if there's conflicts
happening outside of those meetings' (Will, Green Hill). One social
centre had also established an inclusivity group to explore why women
did not attend organising meetings and how to increase accessibility
beyond essentially middle-class, white groups]{.underline}. A number of
social centres had undertaken workshops for members on facilitation and
conflict resolution with the help of the activist collective, Seeds for
Change. The Little London case study demonstrated real barriers to the
translation of such ideas into traditional working-class contexts. [In
particular, the traditional bureaucratic and hierarchical format of the
tenants' committee was slow to accept new ideas and members, was
resilient to change and open to influence by key individuals. On several
occasions, tensions arose between the established committee and this
research team who suggested new opportunities for inquiry and action.
The sheer amount of organisational activity and the deleterious impacts
it had on energy foregrounded all our case studies]{.underline}. Much of
this stemmed from the frustration of numerous meetings that the
consensus approach often requires. As the importance of consensus
becomes more central then the importance of meetings and group process
become amplified. S[ome activists had begun to see the quest for
unqualified consensus as a cumbersome filter in the translation of ideas
into action, and a restraint on dynamism as decisions had to be
channelled through group process. However, although perhaps flawed, it
provided a structure through which all participants were reassured that
they would be heard, and without it internal group efficiency would be
much worse]{.underline}. For example, both Lammas and many social
centres embarked upon idealistic ventures initially planned with as few
rules and as little bureaucracy as possible during early periods of
excitement and possibility. However, over time they shifted towards
imposing a set of structures and rules due to the necessities of legal
and planning stipulations; the need to deal with interpersonal politics
and hold certain individuals to account to the group; to present a
coherent image to the outside world; and to increase the efficiency of
the group in terms of meeting its aims. [Thus, despite the emphasis on
horizontality and consensus, groups sometimes mimicked bureaucratic
structures]{.underline}

### Things that Fail

#### Boycotts cannot destroy capitalism

**Herod '7** (James Herod, Columbia U graduate and political activist,
"Getting Free" Pg. 34,
<https://libcom.org/files/Getting%20Free.pdf>)/ruwur

[Boycotts cannot destroy capitalism. They have always been an extremely
ineffective way to attack the system, and are almost impossible to
organize]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} almost [invariably fail in
their objectives]{.underline}. In the rare cases where they have
succeeded, the gains are minor. A corporation is forced to amend its
labor policies here and there, drop a product, or divest somewhere.
That's about it. In recent years, boycotting has become a way of life
for thousands in the environmental movement. They publish thick books on
which products are okay to buy and which must be boycotted, covering
literally everything from toilet paper to deodorant, food to toys. [All
these activists have succeeded in doing is to create a whole new
capitalist industry of politically correct products.]{.underline} They
have bought into the myth that the "economy" will give us anything we
want if we just demand it, and that it is our demands that have been
wrong rather than the system itself. It's true that it is better to eat
food that hasn't been polluted with insecticides, to wear clothes not
made with child labor, or to use makeup not tested on rabbits. But
[capitalism cannot be destroyed by making such choices.]{.underline} If
we are going to boycott something, we might try boycotting wage slavery.

#### Insurrections cannot destroy capitalism

**Herod '7** (James Herod, Columbia U graduate and political activist,
"Getting Free" Pg. 29,
<https://libcom.org/files/Getting%20Free.pdf>)/ruwur

[Insurrections cannot destroy capitalism]{.underline}. I don't even
think the [ruling class]{.underline} is frightened of them anymore. You
can rampage through the streets all you want, burn down your
neighborhoods, and loot all the local stores to your heart's content.
They [know this will not go anywhere. They know that blind rage will
burn itself out.]{.underline} When it's all over, these insurrectionists
will be showing up for work like always or standing again in the dole
line. [Nothing]{.underline} has [changed. Nothing]{.underline} has been
[organized.]{.underline} No new associations have been created. [What do
capitalists care if they lose a whole city? They can afford
it.]{.underline} [All they have to do is]{.underline} cordon off the
area of conflagration, wait for the fires to burn down, [go in and
arrest thousands of people at random, and then leave, letting the
"rioters" cope]{.underline} with their ruined neighborhoods as best they
can. Maybe we should think of something a little more damaging to
capitalists than burning down our own neighborhoods.

#### Strikes cannot destroy capitalism

**Herod '7** (James Herod, Columbia U graduate and political activist,
"Getting Free" Pg. 27,
<https://libcom.org/files/Getting%20Free.pdf>)/ruwur

General [**strikes cannot destroy capitalism**.]{.underline} There is an
upper limit of about six weeks as to how long they can even last. Beyond
that society starts to disintegrate. But since the general [strikers
have not even thought about reconstituting society through alternative
social arrangements, let alone created them, they are compelled to go
back to their jobs just to survive, to keep from starving]{.underline}.
[All a government has to do is wait them out]{.underline}, perhaps
[making a few concessions to placate the masses. This is what Charles de
Gaulle did in France in 1968]{.underline}. A general strike couldn\'t
even last six weeks if it were really general -- that is, if everyone
stopped working. Under those conditions there would be no water,
electricity, heat, or food. The garbage would pile up. We couldn\'t go
anywhere because the gas stations would be closed. We couldn\'t get
medical treatment. Thus **[we would only be hurting
ourselves]{.underline}**. And what could our objectives possibly be? By
stopping work, we obviously wouldn\'t be aiming at occupying and seizing
our workplaces. If that were our aim we would continue working, but kick
the bosses out. So our main aim would have to be to topple a government
and replace it with another. This might be a legitimate goal if we
needed to get rid of a particularly oppressive regime, but **[as for
getting rid of capitalism, it gets us nowhere.]{.underline}**

#### Capitalists love it when we drop out, the alt is the only way to solve

**Herod '7** (James Herod, Columbia U graduate and political activist,
"Getting Free" Pg. 34-35,
<https://libcom.org/files/Getting%20Free.pdf>)/ruwur

**[We cannot destroy capitalism by dropping out]{.underline}**, either
as an individual, a small group, or a community. [It's been tried over
and over, and it fails every time.]{.underline} There is no escaping
capitalism; there is no-where left to go. [The only escape from
capitalism is to destroy it.]{.underline} Then we could be free (if we
try). In fact, **[capitalists love it when we drop out]{.underline}**.
[They don't need us. They have plenty of suckers already. What do they
care if we live under bridges, beg for meals, and die
young?]{.underline} I haven't seen the ruling class rushing to help the
homeless. Even more illusory than the idea that an individual can drop
out is the notion that a whole community can withdraw from the system
and build its own little new world somewhere else. This was tried
repeatedly by utopian communities throughout the nineteenth century. The
strategy was revived in the 1960s as thousands of new left radicals
retired to remote rural communes to groove on togetherness (and dope).
The strategy is once again surfacing in the new age movement as dozens
of communities are being established all over the country. [These
movements all suffer from the mistaken idea that they don't have to
attack capitalism and destroy it but can simply withdraw from it, to
live their own lives separately and independently. It is a vast
illusion.]{.underline} Capitalists rule the world. Until they are
defeated, there will be no freedom for anyone.

### Utopian Strategizing Good

#### **Understanding specific strategies for communist revolution is key to ensure that autonomous structures know what to work for while staying durable**

**Teo 16** (Shaun S. K. Teo, October 6th 2016, Teo has a PhD in
Geography from University College London which they received using this
paper, they now work at the National University of Singapore in the
Geography Department, "Strategizing for Autonomy: Whither Durability and
Progressiveness?", Antipode,

1420-1421, accessed 7-15-19)//sjp

[Alternative food networks, occupy movements, squatter settlements,
commons projects, countercultural communities, social centres and
neighbourhood co-operatives are all examples of autonomous formations
which have emerged in a smorgasbord of forms, constitutions and scales
around the world. These are collectives where individuals and groups
collaborate to "constitute non-capitalist, egalitarian and solidaristic
forms of political, social and economic organization" (Pickerill and
Chatterton 2006:730]{.underline}). Autonomous formations1 are a blend of
resistance and creation. Their initiators express their disavowal of
capitalism and attempt to demonstrate viable alternatives through their
everyday organization (Pickerill and Chatterton 2006). [What should
autonomous formations work towards in order to achieve the above
imperatives? A fundamental objective is durability. Autonomous
formations must be durable---more than "flashes in the pan" or "pricks
in the system"2 ---if they are to exist as longstanding and ongoing
experimentations of workable alternatives in the present (Begg
2000]{.underline}). [The concept of durability also focuses attention on
the ability of autonomous formations to act in the face of agents which
threaten to displace or overturn, and in so doing exhibit the ability to
exist indefinitely without significant deterioration.3 Additionally,
considerations of durability must be accompanied by a second
objective---the capacity for progressiveness. Progressiveness here
refers to the "capacity to engage in genuinely deliberative democratic
dialogue to develop contestable alternative agendas and work in ways
that meaningfully challenge existing power relations" (MacKinnon and
Derickson 2013:263). Autonomous formations derive their significance
from their political intent, even if this means challenging and changing
the system brick by boring brick]{.underline}. However, solely asking
what autonomous formations need to work towards cannot explain how they
might get there[. Likewise, attempts to evaluate their transformative
strategies without an elucidation of what exactly they need to work
towards are also futile. It is therefore necessary to first understand
what exactly autonomous formations need to work towards, including how
these objectives relate, in order for a theorization of how they should
strategize to achieve these objectives]{.underline}. This paper derives
its significance by considering together these what and how aspects (see
also Iveson 2014). Such an initiative has been an on-going challenge
central to the interests of a journal like Antipode; it is also a
necessary pursuit if clearer pathways to challenging injustice are to be
developed (Iveson 2014; Katznelson 1992).

#### **Protest and strikes are not enough---anti-capitalist strategizing centered around the creation of communist infrastructures is key to overcome the entrenchment of capitalism**

**Shantz 12** (Jeff Shantz, May 3rd 2012, "Beyond May Day: From Ritual
to Resistance", Philosophers for Change,

Accessed 7-15-19)//sjp

Beyond ritualism [There is a rote ritualism that gives street demos and
public expressions of dissent priority over other strategies and
tactics]{.underline}. Yet mass demos that bring together atomized
individuals without a real base or infrastructures supporting the
mobilizations have minimal real impact. As James Herod suggests: But
opposition movements gravitate again and again to these kinds of
actions. "Taking to the Streets," we call it[. Yet we can't build a new
social world in the streets. As long as we're only in the streets,
whereas our opponents function through enduring organizations like
governments, corporations, and police, we will always be on the
receiving end of tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, and almost
everywhere in the world but North America or Europe, real bullets,
napalm, poisons, and bombs. (2007, 3)]{.underline} It seems highly
likely, indeed almost certain, that the spectacular waves of alternative
globalization struggles from the summit protests since Seattle in 1999
to the ongoing Occupy movements launched in 2011, will lose momentum and
subside or drift into reformism in the absence of building real
connections and moving toward struggles for control in workplaces and
neighborhoods. [The realms of workplaces, neighborhoods, and households
have largely been ignored or abandoned as sites of transformative
struggle by current activist movements (Herod 2007, 2). Workplace
struggles, where they exist at all, are dominated by bureaucratic
mainstream unions focused on bargaining compromises with employers.
Household organizing has been largely overlooked by radical
activists---apart from those who retreat into their own (privatized and
detached) collective houses.]{.underline} Issues of mental health and
wellbeing have been given too little attention in movements focused on
economics and politics in a more traditional and limited fashion.
Building infrastructure of resistance [Anarchists recognize (or should)
that struggles for a better world beyond state capitalism must occur on
two simultaneous levels. It must be capable of defeating states and
capital and it must, at the same time, provide infrastructures or
foundations of the future society in the present day]{.underline}.
Indeed, this latter process will be a fundamental part of the work of
defeating states and capital. [Through infrastructures of resistance
movements will build alternatives but, as importantly, have capacities
to defend the new social formations. These infrastructures of resistance
will directly confront state capitalist power. Thus they will need to be
defended from often savage attack]{.underline}. The key impulse is to
shift the terrain of anti-capitalist struggle from a defensive
position---reacting to elite policies and practices or merely offering
dissent---to an offensive one---contesting ruling structures and
offering workable alternatives. [Movements need to shift from a position
of resistance to one of active transformation]{.underline}. [There is a
pressing need to take decision-making out of government bureaucracies,
parliament, and corporate suites and boardrooms and relocate it in
autonomous assemblies of working class and poor people. There is also a
need to take activism out of the atypical realms of demonstrations and
protests and root it in everyday contexts and the daily experiences of
working class and poor people's social lives. This would serve to meet
practical needs---of shelter, education, health, and wellbeing---while
also raising visions for broader alternatives and stoking the capacity
to imagine or see new possibilities. Building infrastructures of
resistance will directly affect movements in practical and visionary
ways. It will also challenge ruling elites by pushing them into
reactive, rather than purely offensive, and confident, positions. Such
infrastructures of resistance would shift possibilities for strategizing
and mobilization]{.underline}. They might render demonstrations
unnecessary. As Herod suggests: I[f we had reorganized ourselves into
neighborhood, workplace, and household assemblies, and were struggling
to seize power there, then we would have a base from which to stop
ruling-class offensives like neoliberalism. If we then chose to
demonstrate in the streets, there would be some teeth to it, rather than
it being just an isolated ephemeral event, which can be pretty much
ignored by our rulers. We would not be just protesting but countering.
We have to organize ourselves in such a way that we have the power to
counter them, not just protest against them, to refuse them \[and\] to
neutralize them]{.underline}. This cannot be done by affinity groups,
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), or isolated individuals converging
periodically at world summits to protest against the ruling class, but
only by free associations rooted in normal everyday life. (2007, 2--3)
Transformation must focus on controlling means of reproduction as well
as means of production. Focus on workers control alone leaves
communities unable to allocate resources effectively and efficiently to
meet broader needs (social or ecological). At the same time, community
control without control of means of production would be futile, a
fantasy. Even more, leaving households as privatized realms would
reinforce an unequal gender division of labor and reinforce the duality
of public and private realms of which anarchists are generally critical
(Herod 2007, 13). At the very least, neighborhood assemblies will
constantly lose people who need to move in search of employment in the
absence of worker control of industry. [A new social world cannot be
built from scratch. Nor does it need to be. The mutual aid relationships
and already existing associations that people have organized around work
and personal interests (clubs, groups, informal workplace networks, even
subcultures) can provide possible resources. At the same time, many
infrastructures are needed, even today, in working class and poor
neighborhoods and households, many workers have only loose informal
connections in their workplaces.]{.underline} In apartment complexes,
households can link up in direct assemblies to organize shared
resources. Some might include cooking, maintenance, laundry, health
care, education, birthing rooms, and recreational facilities (Herod
2007, 11). [Building infrastructures of resistance encourages novel ways
of thinking about revolutionary transformation. Rather than the familiar
form of street organization or protest action, within constructive
anarchist approaches, the action is in the organizing. There need to be
already existing infrastructures or else a radical or revolutionary
transformation will be impossible (or disastrous). On the need for
pre-existing revolutionary infrastructures, we might concur with Herod
who suggests: Workplace associations would have to be permanent
assemblies, with years of experience under their belts, before they
could have a chance of success. They cannot be new forms suddenly thrown
up in the depths of a crisis or the middle of a general strike, with a
strong government still waiting in the wings, supported by its fully
operational military forces. (2007, 26)]{.underline} Similarly general
strikes cannot have a meaningful impact in the absence of
infrastructures of resistance. As Herod notes: General strikes cannot
destroy capitalism. There is an upper limit of about six weeks as to how
long they can even last. Beyond that society starts to disintegrate. But
since the general strikers have not even thought about reconstituting
society through alternative social arrangements, let alone created them,
they are compelled to go back to their jobs just to survive, to keep
from starving. All a government has to do is wait them out, perhaps
making a few concessions to placate the masses. This is what Charles de
Gaulle did in France in 1968. (2007, 27) [Under general strike
conditions essential goods and services would be absent. Water, energy,
food, and medical services would not be available without alternative
associations or capacities to occupy and run workplaces to meet human
social needs. These sorts of takeover themselves require pre-existing
infrastructures.]{.underline}

#### **Specifically, anti-capitalist utopian thinking is key to open up cracks in capitalism that can generate instances of democratic resistance.**

At the same time, Trump did project a vision that appealed to voters,
particularly white voters, and this vision is similar to the utopianism
that lay at the founding of the U.S. America was seen as a utopian
project, the "New World" and "a shining city upon a hill" as put by the
puritan John Winthrop. [Such utopian vision still permeates this
country, and Trump tapped into its narrative power]{.underline}.
Therefore, what we witnessed in Trump's election was a battle of
competing utopias where reactionary utopia proved victorious. Utopia is
invoked in reactionary political campaigns, and seeps into the "common
sense" of status quo ideology. David Harvey exposes this in his
exploration of free market ideologies, with their mantras of an
"invisible hand" balancing an unfettered market and insistence that the
arc of history is progressive. "[The most effective Utopians in recent
times," he discovers, "have been those of a right-wing persuasion"
(2000:176-177). But "the utopian rhetoric of freedom, liberty, and
markets conceals so effectively \[their utopian content\] that we often
find it difficult to articulate the pattern of underlying coerced
collaborations that otherwise stares us so blatantly in the face"
(Harvey 2000:181]{.underline}). Adding to this, David Graeber points out
that modern bureaucracy, itself based in utopian aspirations, also
conceals its utopian underpinnings. Graeber contends that "what
ultimately lies behind the appeal of bureaucracy is fear of play"
(2015:193). Play is defined as "the free expression of creative
energies...for its own sake" (2015:192). Games, conversely, are bounded
by rules with clear objectives. Following the rules, in games, actually
allows the player the opportunity to win the game. Graeber contends that
"bureaucracies create games---they're just games that are in no sense
fun" (2015:190). By understanding and obeying the rules of the game (the
rules of governance by administration), players can win, in essence, at
the games of life. "Games, then, are a kind of utopia of rules"
(2015:191). Therefore, even in our arguments on democracy versus
republicanism, we are engaging in a duel of utopias. He concludes:
\[Utopian bureaucracy has\] created a situation where the pursuit of
freedom from arbitrary power simply ends up producing more arbitrary
power, and as a result, regulations choke existence, armed guards and
surveillance cameras appear everywhere, science and creativity are
smothered, and all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our
day taken up in the filling out of forms. (Graeber 2015:205) Since the
right maintains power on the basis of its utopian content, needed now is
the generation of a mobilizing conception of utopia for our left
movements. [Notwithstanding my previous criticisms, one very hopeful
element in the 2016 election cycle appeared in Bernie Sanders ability to
galvanize people by promoting "political revolution." Though the details
of his political revolution left much to the imagination, the real
source of optimism is found in the energies unleashed by millions of
people in pushing for dramatic changes in the here and now. Therefore,
revolution is back on the table, and utopia fixed to revolutionary
projects is precisely the direction we need to take. Generating a utopia
needs to employ a radical imagination which is not afraid, and indeed
insists, upon a total social revolution against the totality of
capitalism]{.underline}. [If the left does not generate a more inspired
vision, we will continue to be defeated by the utopian projects of the
right. How do we find each other for the project of collective utopian
dreaming? Answering this question demonstrates the need for the radical
imagination, as its incorporation of the prefigurative and strategic
aligns our shared projects in locating spaces for charting revolutionary
goals. This means discovering the cracks in capitalism, and using these
cracks for revolutionary actions that can initiate intentional ruptures
within capitalism's totality]{.underline}. [We will find, in our
movement, that there can be no single vanguard leading this campaign but
a collection of vanguards connecting multiple centers together.
Additionally, it will be apparent that injecting democracy into these
centers---these spaces---will reorient authority and power giving our
movements a stronger position in which we can deploy more durable
revolutionary forces. The road ahead is necessarily long, revolution
will not be a single momentous event but an accumulation of social
energies (signaling the importance of cracks and ruptures in the
prevailing social order)]{.underline}. We should not mourn this fact. As
noted above, oppression is not always obvious to the oppressed, and
since none of us are outside of society this means that we are inundated
today with oppressions we are probably not even aware exist.
[Revolutionary processes will allow us to gain deeper insights into the
true meaning of freedom and liberation, where the oppressions we are
oblivious to today will be the target of future generations that take
the reins of revolution. This is only possible in the action of
revolution, as the direction of tomorrow does not follow a predetermined
arc of progress; the direction is made]{.underline}. For us, we need to
craft prefigurative strategies for moving forward. The following is my
attempt at sketching what this might look like in action. [Occupy Wall
Street offered a window into understanding the importance of democratic
daily life. By prioritizing the setting-up of encampments in public
parks OWS highlighted the significance of democratic process and
deliberation. Occupation was the tactic, and it was coupled with an idea
that we could use these seized spaces as democratic public
spheres.]{.underline} Capitalist totality seeks the privatization of all
space---thus the domination of space entirely. For occupiers, public
parks were small cracks in the advance of capitalist totality. [Public
space is merely the inverse of private space---as what is not private is
publically administered by the state and thus void of democratic
control. However, the general population tends to view public spaces in
a positive light, signaling their rough belief in the need for shared
and open spaces]{.underline}. So OWS filled the (ideological) cracks
with its own set of ideals, its own utopian project, and immediately
sought to cultivate these cracks as spaces for genuinely open
participation and deep democracy. In this regard, "the space of Occupy
was not only physical, but also symbolic" (Goodewardena 2016:409). [The
cracks of public parks were used to confront alienation, but they also
offered a glimpse on how to connect the cracks. One of the magical
moments of OWS was when it went from being an isolated protest tactic in
an obscure New York City park to spreading like wildfire across the
country and around the globe. Park occupation had a strategic brilliance
based on its simplicity, which ran as follows: we can turn our public
park into a site of democracy, and so can you. It invited ordinary
people from all over to engage in the same type of activity. No longer
was it seen as necessary to lobby one's congressperson or go through the
formal political channels to be active in politics, instead you could
just take a walk through the park and engage in political debate,
deliberation, and decision-making. What could be more utopian? OWS
offered a view of one way our movements can create visible entry-points
for the public at large to enter into movement actions---thus they
(temporarily) seized spaces for revolutionary (re)production. OWS
offered many insights, both through its successes and limitations, and
one particular insight is on needing to hold these spaces of
revolutionary (re)production longer.]{.underline}

#### **Understanding specific anti-capitalist tactcs is key---specifically, focusing on the opening of communist spaces can generate the utopian fissures that enable collective resistance.**

[Practically speaking, these spaces could be formed by tying together
projects for community land trusts with cooperative businesses54 and
local political efforts (whether referendums, issue-oriented
mobilizations, etc.) all oriented toward establishing present-day
commons]{.underline}. Organized labor, Black Lives Matter chapters,
environmental organizations, indigenous tribes, and offshoots of Occupy
Wall Street (such as Occupy Homes) could unify around these broad-based
efforts. Indeed, contemporary movements appear to be shifting in a
direction which understands the importance of space. Writes Kanishka
Goonewardena, "the events of the Arab Spring...and the Occupy
Movement...revealed that 'space' is both an essential mediation of
politics and an unmediated object of political struggle" (2016:408[).
Spaces can become blocs of power, interlacing land, politics, and
economics with prefigurative practices of care work and democratic
social life. By seizing space, instead of states, our prefigurative
strategies do the work of creating communities bounded by more than
their geographical or national character. They create resistance
communities. One could frame this as "neighborhood organizing." Such has
always been central for successful anti-capitalist campaigns, whether of
an explicitly labor union front or project of dismantling racial
oppression, etc. On the left the conflation of tactics and strategies is
constant, but tactics (such as acquiring forms of state power) are means
toward end goals---for us that goal is open utopia]{.underline}. 55
Durable spaces for revolutionary (re)production allow tactics more
opportunity for success. Explains David Harvey, in reference to
unionization movements in the early twentieth-century, "work-based
struggles, from strikes to factory takeovers, are far more likely to
succeed when there is...support from...the surrounding neighborhood or
community level" (2012:138). Revolutionary (re)productive spaces,
however, imply bigger spaces than neighborhoods[. In his work on Rebel
Cities, David Harvey repeats the concern that capitalist totality
requires our movements to take into account the question of scale. "The
plain fact is that certain problems," he writes, "only become visible at
particular scales, and it is only appropriate that democratic decisions
be made at those scales" (2012:152-153). Harvey's concern leads him to
ponder the possibilities of organizing an entire city. Surveying the
history of urban rebellions, spanning a vast terrain in time and space
from Paris, Cairo, Cochabamba, and more, Harvey discovers that in times
of urban uprisings singular centers of activity are rare]{.underline}.
More often, these rebellions spread not only to close geographic
locations but across the whole globe. One example includes Paris 1968,
which quickly spread to "Chicago, Mexico City, Bangkok, and others"
(Harvey 2012:115). [The local is a spark which can ignite global
conflagrations, and Harvey's Rebel Cities propose the possibility of
city after city, like dominos, succumbing to the will of the people.
Injecting these energies into the everyday requires viewing daily social
life as opportunities for rebellion.]{.underline} [To display how the
radical imagination changes views on strategy, I want to focus briefly
on how labor unions can employ this method for revolution.]{.underline}
Stanley Aronowitz, an experienced union organizer, issued a convincing
argument that the labor movement's current woes are not due to a lack in
unionized numbers---even with small union percentages in the public and
private sector millions of union members exist in the nation---but due
to a lack in the radical imagination. [He urges unions to embrace its
radical roots, particularly its militancy and regular use of the strike
as a tactic, but understands that the constraints on labor's collective
imagination prevent its revitalization (Aronowitz 2014). A radical
vision is not unachievable if unions commit to reassessing their
preconceptions. First, labor union efforts must extend beyond the work
site. What is viewed as a form of labor, or of productivity, under
capitalist economic regimes has tended to ignore social (re)production
as labor]{.underline}. Undertaken primarily by women, (re)production
refers to child-raising (which guarantees future labor supplies), food
cultivation, general housework, and emotional or interpretive labor
which are all necessary for reproducing social life (Federici 2012).
[Further, opening up conceptions of what is work and who qualifies as a
laborer forces the imagination to enlarge and recognize additional forms
of labor made invisible in the U.S.---namely, prison labor. Janaé Bonsu,
in an article for Dissent, urges us to "imagine if prison laborers were
entitled to a minimum wage, overtime pay, and workers' compensation when
injured on the job" (2017).]{.underline} The outcome would effectively
strike against the core of today's New Jim Crow. Bonsu argues that
prison laborers should not be overlooked in unionization campaigns, and
persuades readers to understand that if prison workers were seen as a
centerpiece of organized labor's strategy the prospects for a revolution
would increase dramatically. Here, as well, Bonsu offers a view of
finding ways to connect the cracks between different movement groups
(Dissent 2017). [Encouraging developments are taking place for the
radical imagination to reinsert itself into organized labor. Since the
1990s the rise of "worker centers" has increased from approximately 10
locations to over 250 (Bobo and Pebellón 2016). This is a welcome
development, as worker centers operate to encourage the creation of
cooperative businesses, recreational spaces, educational support
services, and more. But we also need unions to begin understanding that
their fight is for affordable housing, single-payer healthcare, and less
hours of work with guaranteed universal (and livable) incomes, to name
only a few critical issues]{.underline}. In capturing spaces for
revolutionary (re)production, imagine if unions shifted the money they
dump into the Democrat party into the creation of cooperative living
establishments. For union members, they would have access to fixed-rents
in areas where their neighbors are their union comrades (yes, they could
begin seeing them as comrades instead of co-workers). They could also
link these residential areas for union members with land trusts for
sustainable farming, along with recreational centers for children and
families. [From this standpoint, union members can launch their own
political initiatives rooted to their local conditions. This would allow
them to bolster their already developing revolutionary spaces with
political power which would serve as a buffer between their communities
and the larger state without necessarily entering into fruitless direct
combat with the state. Essentially, these prefigurative strategies
cultivate a new project for the commons, a concept which has recently
gained a lot of political saliency amongst the left]{.underline}. For
proponents of the commons, the construct "includes seeds, genes, urban
spaces, electromagnetic waves and software programs, languages and
cultural works, and many other social realities" (Caffentzis 2016:98).
Thus, the commons "are brought into existence every day" (Caffentzis
2016:98). Large unions waste millions upon millions of dollars of their
union members' dues every year on political efforts which have only
weakened organized labor in the long run---why not invest in worker
communities---worker commons---instead? Argues George Caffentzis, "if we
view the commons not as a distant goal but as the movement that negates
the present order of things...then the outline of a path emerges"
(2016:101). This is only an idea of how to begin, but exercising the
radical imagination reveals and creates possibilities. [Community land
trusts could help eliminate hunger and homelessness in our
neighborhoods, cooperatives could strengthen local economies with
businesses less concerned with profit than with providing value and
livelihoods for people, and municipal political power can help buffer
such projects from the power of the larger state and capital.
Encouraging efforts throughout the U.S. and threading them together into
a single whole is crucial, and though they won't look the same
internationally, the rough place-based outlines of this strategy can be
generalized throughout the world since creativity and local adaptation
are at the heart of the radical imagination. Finding spaces to turn into
common spaces, to develop into sites of revolutionary (re)production,
can shatter the alienation of daily life and point toward a better
horizon---an open utopia. The above is a call for a different world
which entails a different global project, one where the "production of
space becomes a non-alienating, radical-democratic praxis" (Goonewardena
2016:412)---a product of the radical imagination. Doing so begins by
seeing the rebellion inside every ordinary person, creating entry-points
for them to connect with vanguards that bring multiple centers together,
and injecting democracy into everyday life to eliminate alienation. Let
us try now to find these cracks, these open spaces, and commit to
deepening the cracks, connecting them, and initiating intentional
ruptures before these all-important spaces close.]{.underline}

### AT Affect

#### Affect based praxis is an academic embellishment that displaces structural analysis -- the aff leaves a political vacuum in which any and all non-liberal politics can flourish -- only an affirmative communist vision grounded in praxis can change the horizons of political possibility

Contrary to Jameson\'s famous declaration of the \"waning of affect,\"
in recent years, [interest in the affective potentialities of
subjectivity, corporeality, and community has proliferated to form what
might be called an \"affective turn\" with \"multiple and, often
contradictory, genealogical threads.]{.underline}\"78 In social studies
and humanities [[affect has been used mostly]{.mark} as a means [to
study socio-cultural practices and the relations they
establish]{.mark}]{.underline} between various people, places, objects,
and events.79 [[The concept is often equated with
emotions]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is, \"sociolinguistic fixings\"
(e.g., love, hate, envy, pity, etc.) belonging to persons, groups,
events, or memory and narrativized through stories and images. [This has
happened to the dissatisfaction of more radical strands in cultural
studies, which define affect as virtual impulses that do not express an
experiential or sensorial condition, but the transition from one state
of being to another.]{.underline}80 Therefore, in body studies, media
theory, queer studies, and philosophy affect is mostly used to refer to
precognitive, embodied experiences that escape textual and empirical
methods and are closer to biological, psychological, and informational
sciences.81 Finally, affect is also well-represented in critical
Marxism, both in operaismo and feminist Marxist discussions of
\"affective labor\" and broader reflections on the affective
potentialities of \"the commons\" and \"being-in-common.\"82 It is
beyond the scope of this paper to offer a comprehensive survey of this
literature. Instead[, I want to recapitulate some of the problems the
\"affective turn\" claims to resolve with regards to cultural and social
theory.]{.underline} In doing so, [[I]{.mark} also want to [express my
doubts about their unreserved celebration of affect as]{.mark} being
[the solution to our theoretical impasse]{.mark} and the key to
political transformation.]{.underline} After all, [[it is strange
that]{.mark} what Jameson once took to be the source of loss - [the
deadening of affect following the decline of the humanist
subject]{.mark} and the end of mass politics - [is now being hailed as a
theoretical and political opening]{.mark}.]{.underline}83 The \"turn to
affect\" can be read as a backlash to the \"cultural turn\" and its
obsession with constructivist models of knowing, particularly its
emphasis on empiricism, language and signification. [Affect aficionados
complain that enlightenment-fuelled social and cultural
studies]{.underline}, regardless of whether they employ quantitative or
qualitative research methods, [are too obsessed with
epistemology]{.underline}, with observing or listening to the \"speaking
subject\" to fully account for the role of subjectivity in social
life.84 What is more, critical theory, they argue, has become so
consumed with how power circulates through the social field and gets
reproduced through language, habitus, or performance, that it gives us a
social picture with little or no wiggle room. Human experience is fixed
into predictable units of race, gender and sexuality, while our
political landscape remains locked between the two poles of repression
and subversion. This social ontology offers neither a complete picture
of human life, nor does it exhaust our political possibilities for
action. There is always something that escapes or ends up on the cutting
floor of this epistemological orientation and that something is
precisely that which could restore the therapeutic and transformative
properties of theory.85 [The missing piece is, of course, affect, this
non-verbal, non-conscious, non-social residue or excess, which escapes
representational methods of inquiry but which nonetheless \"constitutes
the very fabric of our being.]{.underline}\"86 In psychoanalytical
parlance, affect refers to the drives, energies, intensities, and
variations that lie at the basis of our actions and emotions. It is a
residual that escapes or cuts across our received categories of knowing
and being to remain outside any system of signification.87 Affect is not
a concept that can be brought \"into\" the theories and methods we
already have. Rather, it represents a radical attack on the current
state of social and critical theory. [While affect has been adopted in
dissimilar and sometimes contradictory ways across various fields of
interest, [what unites]{.mark} all [affect enthusiasts is the]{.mark}
tempting [promise that greater attention to the transient]{.mark} and
excessive, the embodied and impulsive [elements of
life]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., movement, transformation, impulses,
drives, emotions, relationality, temporality, virtuality, and
autopoiesis) [[will rescue subjectivity from \"paranoid\" cultural
theory]{.mark} and invest individuals with a certain degree of control
over their future.]{.underline}88 [While this vast interest in affect
has opened up new lines of inquiry, [relatively little has been done to
unpack the subjective condition at the heart of social
reproduction.]{.mark} Because [most affect studies go to great lengths
to do away with the stability but not the ethicality of
selfhood]{.mark}, [they end up drawing a linear connection between
affect and progressive politics despite there not being any certainty as
to what political form affect might take.]{.mark} We still know very
little about what makes individuals either reproduce or transgress the
injunctions of power.]{.underline} While I do not want to deny the
significance of the concept, I fear that [[a number of affect
theorists]{.underline}]{.mark}, and here I would include autonomist
Marxists[, [have embellished]{.mark} the \"good\" side of [affect at the
expense of scholarly rigor]{.mark} and historical fact.]{.underline}89

A glaring absence of Black radical and revolutionary intellectual
history should be expected from any expression of \"Afro-pessimism.\"
Indeed, could Afro-pessimism 2.0 take hold as another trend in
mainstream academia except in the political void produced after the
1960s and \'70s by local as well as global counter-revolution and
counter-insurgency? This absence affects the shape and agenda of the
critical analysis of \"anti-Black racism\" in essential ways.
[Wilderson\'s critique of [the \"ruse of analogy\"]{.mark}]{.underline}
in Red, White & Black [[becomes a refrain that naturalizes academic
approaches to politics now institutionalized with]{.mark} the continued
reign of [Western bourgeois liberalism. For older]{.mark} and enduring
[Black radical perspectives, the existence of \"anti-Black racism\"
among non-Black peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}, organizations, and
movements [[is neither a new nor shocking phenomenon.]{.mark} For many
Black revolutionary movement logics of the \'60s and \'70s, for
instance, [this did not preclude alliance]{.mark} (or the exhaustion of
alliances made) [or lead to a]{.mark} doctrinaire [rejection of
\"solidarity\" work]{.mark} and its international (or \"intercommunal\")
possibilities.]{.underline}[27](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/685979#f27)
[[\"Contradictions\" were expected]{.mark}, so to speak, in theory and
practice, which might be resolved or not, depending on material
interest, circumstance, etc. **For them, [this work was not about
gauging identity, or the perfection of a projected analogy, but
mobilization for the political accomplishments of
revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[a revolutionism [that could]{.mark}
or may not [work toward]{.mark} the development of [a new humanism
not]{.mark} white or racist or [anti-Black]{.mark} after all. The reach
for potential solidarities was not construed as a gift or an act of
good-willed benevolence, wise or unwise given the risks. [Even
solidarity work with]{.mark} obviously problematic, [openly enemy forces
could be a strategic]{.mark} or tactical [mode of advancing Black
collective self-interests]{.mark} that might dispense with any alliance
at any given moment in time without seeing the relationship as a
statement of some total identity or non-identity of condition and
interests.]{.underline} The notion of solidarity has nowadays been
superficialized, remaining riveted on mere rhetorical proclamation and
aesthetic or representational identification in neo-colonial culture
industries here and there. [[An older, praxical approach to
alliance]{.mark}, perhaps \"analogy,\" and solidarity [is not taken up
by current analyses of identity conflicts]{.mark} that prevail with the
resurgence of a more academic political-intellectualism and a now much
less contested liberalism. [This is imperial \"multiculturalism\" and
its malcontents.]{.mark} As much as [Afro-pessimism]{.mark} (2.0) may
object to certain instances of liberalism]{.underline}, or \[End Page

the same, thereby [ensconcing the colonialism and neo-colonialism it

###  AT Antiblackness = Ontological

#### The political ontology of anti-blackness is locked into place through the alienation of black labor and abstraction through the form of capital -- raising antiblackness to an ontological level ignores the contingency of capital risk

Okay, hi. My name is Ramon Amaro. Thank you to the organizers for having
me here today. I'm actually going to diverge a second and take the
conversation to an ontological and theoretical point that can hopefully
emerge to different conversations as we go on later. Namely, what I want
to begin with is the idea of bare life of the black female body, an idea
that Alessandra Raengo argues must be understood if we are even to
critique modern forms of capital, as what we know as **[[the black form
is already subsumed in the monetary form of capital and the fictive
substance of race]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What I mean, and what I would
like to propose here in following Raengo, is what she calls "[[the
ontological scandal]{.underline}]{.mark}" perpetuated by slavery. This
scandal, according to Raengo, [[is repeated "with each instance of
alienated black labor]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[each time blackness
functions as the commodity form]{.underline}]{.mark}, and with each
repetition they continue to be reified." But what's important is
[[Raengo]{.mark}'s]{.underline} gesture [[**presupposes** that]{.mark}
the production and subsequent **[domination]{.mark}** of colonial
**nations [today]{.mark}** **[are predicated on the abstract reification
of the black female body as]{.mark} a mode of
[currency.]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[To]{.mark} even begin to [address
this ontological scandal, we must first think through how the black body
is individuated as a currency]{.mark} of exchange [within modern
financial systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, extensive work
has been done by [Spillers, Hartman, and others]{.underline} to
[illuminate the important role of]{.underline} the cargo ship on [the
Middle Passage as a scene of **capital** exchange and racial
subjection]{.underline}. However, [I want to build on this work to think
through]{.underline} **[[the genesis of the black self as already
informed by the logics of innumeration and speculative
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where **[[the pre-individuated state of
black being is always already contaminated by the conditions of
labor-based capital accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But [this
accumulation also informs a dissonance between the real black sense of
self and any social agreement that may abstract the black self
into]{.underline}, as Denise DeSilva argues**[, a formative system of
monetary value]{.underline}**. In other words, as Ian BacComb describes,
the growth of Anglo-European **[[financial domination was not merely a
cycle]{.mark} of labor and exchange, [but a]{.mark} scaled [transaction
of]{.mark} quantifiable [insurance risk]{.mark} associated with the
contingency of death and illness aboard slave cargo
ships]{.underline}**. BacComb points to the British economy in
particular to discuss the granting of a real existence of enslaved
bodies inasmuch as the survival and the successful delivery of these
bodies can be bought virtually as the hidden substance of insurance
contracts and bills of credit. Or in the case of the British slave ship
Zong, **[[the enslaved body is underwritten as the speculative risk of
capital]{.mark}, and public outrage.]{.underline}** In this way, [the
importance of the enslaved body to modes of capital is not predicated to
actual material flesh, or even the potential for that body to labor, but
was instead articulated as an abstract flow of enumeration and
probability]{.underline}. If, under this premise, we are to take W.B.
DuBois at face value and consider the double consciousness of the
racialized individual, then we are immediately confronted with the
fragmentation of black genesis as a tension between what is made visible
as blackness or **[[black non-being]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which Sylvia
Wynters argues **[[is already owned by ontology]{.mark} [as a problem of
bio-epistemic compliance and the regime of prototypical capital
existence]{.mark}, [which]{.mark}]{.underline}** I argue **[[is
symptomatic of a larger logic of social
quantification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So I just wanna diverge for a
second and return to the issue of **[the Zong]{.underline}** for those
who aren't familiar, the issue of the slave body on the British slaver
was the start and emergence of the British insurance industry. If anyone
knows, there was an illness that broke out on the slave ship, in the
middle of the Atlantic, seven crew members died, and I think it was in
term of like twenty slaves, and the captain of that ship decided that,
actually, it was cheaper to throw all the slaves overboard and claim the
insurance than it was to continue the passage. And when he returned back
to England, he sued the insurance company, and that **[was the start of
litigation \-- of the body itself as being a virtual point of
risk]{.underline}**. And what I'm arguing is that, since that
development, obviously we know how pervasive the insurance industry is,
how pervasive capital mechanisms are at identifying risk and
probability, and what I'm arguing here is, following Raengo, is that
what we know today as modern capitalism in the UK is already predicated
on the violence of the black female body. So, to continue, as [[the
terms of]{.mark} contemporary [capital depart from the]{.mark}
derivation of value as the direct engagement with the **[body]{.mark}**
to the technics of labor practice]{.underline}, so in other words,
**[[it no longer became about the actual slave]{.mark} being delivered
to do manual labor -- [the financial gain was greater]{.mark} from
actually deriving insurance risk on the body itself]{.underline}**.
[[So]{.underline} **[the body only became a black body once it was
subsumed into capital]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[types of
[risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[These engagements emerged as adaptive
forms of information exchange that, unlike popular believe, are
indifferent to the specificity of the body.]{.underline}** However, it
is specific only as much as [the racialized body can be extracted into
quantifiable forms of data and pre-emption, which continues today to be
defined as social value in contemporary techno-capital
institutions.]{.underline} What I'm attempting to highlight is that
while [**the technology of**]{.underline} shipping and [**insurance
risk**,]{.underline} predicated on violence and the abstraction of the
black body, [were once the lens through which blackness was made
visible, the emergence of new generative types of technology, like
machine learning, enact an accelerated form of targeting and visibility
that no longer require physicality, but depend on the meta-abstraction
of all social phenomenon to locate the body as a measure of correlation
and probability]{.underline}. So, in other words, after the Zong,
following Raengo here, after the Zong, **[the idea of abstracting the
body into actual risk]{.underline}**, of course, further objectified the
black body, but it also **[set a precedent of actual citizenship being
viewed as potential financial gain]{.underline}** or potential
investment.

#### The 1AC's philosophical prefabrications fails to grasp the desire for a new world. Rather than critique, or "protest", the demand for change in the war against racial capitalism provides a better philosophical praxis to reach the undoing of this world

José [[Muñoz charts the place of utopia]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
performances of and by queer subjects]{.underline}. For [Muñoz,
performativity can be best understood [as an act of "doing in the
future]{.mark}," where a particular text activates a process of
becoming-future]{.underline} (Muñoz 26, 189). Building on the notion of
the performative in a poem by James Schuyler, he writes: To "read" the
performative, along the lines of thought first inaugurated by J.L.
Austin, is implicitly to critique the epistemological. Performativity
and utopia both 77 call into question what is epistemologically there
and signal a highly ephemeral ontological field that can be
characterized as a doing in futurity. [Thus, [a manifesto]{.mark} [is a
call to]{.mark} a [doing in and for the future]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The utopian impulse to be gleaned from the poem is a call for "doing"
that is a becoming: the becoming of and for "future
generations."]{.underline} (emphasis in original, Muñoz 26) [The notion
of [calling into question]{.mark} ["what is
epistemologically]{.mark}]{.underline} [[there" and signaling]{.mark}
[an "ephemeral ontological field]{.mark}"]{.underline} [model [the work
of the Panthers']{.mark} declaration of war]{.underline} (Muñoz 26). The
formal qualities of declarations (similar to that of the manifesto)
foreground the present's incapacity to account for black freedom,
therefore [in order to [herald a vision of a world]{.mark} that
does]{.underline}, [the Panthers' use of declarations of war signal an
"ephemeral ontological field" where black freedom, perhaps, can/will
exist---at least for a moment]{.underline} in 1966 (26). A declaration
calls into question the epistemological, **[[in the service of imagining
an intangible ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words,
performativity critiques the stability of ideology in its current state
towards another way of being. In this way, the declaration is not a form
of rupture that disrupts ideology, but rather it enacts the limits of
ideology. By activating ideology's limits, I mean that [[the Panthers'
declarations articulate demands]{.mark} [that are impossible for current
state and capitalist investments to imagine,]{.mark} let alone
grant]{.underline}. In this way, **[[these performative demands]{.mark}
[suggest way to think of black freedom as an antagonistic]{.mark}
([non)ontology that requires a fundamental]{.mark} [Fanonian
"undoing]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."]{.mark} To address this "undoing" and
in order to get to a critical analysis of the Panthers' declaration of
war against the U.S. government and capitalism, I offer Frank B.
Wilderson's reading of Frantz Fanon as a generous model of critique, one
that acknowledges the epistemological limits of thinking black freedom.
Cautioning against the overwhelming 78 intellectual pressure to offer
prescriptive measures in the concluding section of one's book,
Wilderson's epilogue to Red, White, and Black utilizes Fanon's
concluding remarks to suggest another model: Frantz Fanon came closest
to the only image of sowing and harvesting that befits this book.
Quoting Aimé Césaire, he urged his readers to start "the end of the
world," the "only thing...worth the effort of starting," a shift from
horticulture to pyrotechnics. Rather than mime the restoration and
reorganization which conclusions often fall prey to, however
unwittingly, Fanon dreams of undoing, however implausible, for its own
sake. Still, there are moments when Fanon finds his own flames too
incendiary. So much so that he momentarily backs away from the
comprehensive emancipation he calls for. Which is why one can find the
Fanon of the Slave on the same page as the Fanon of the postcolonial
subject. Nonetheless, I am humbled by his efforts, and though I am
freighted with enough hubris to extend his ensemble of questions beyond
his unintentional containment strategies, I know better than to
underrate their gravitas by offering\--or even hinting at\--a roadmap to
freedom so extensive it would free us from the epistemic air we breathe.
To say we must be free of air, while admitting to knowing no other
source of breath\... (Wilderson 337-338) In this careful and deliberate
move, Wilderson allows his own theoretical divergence from Fanon to be
articulated without the pretense of eliding the subtleties within
Fanon's extensive and influential work. For Wilderson, [[it is Fanon's
call for "undoing,"]{.mark} the "start]{.underline} \[of\] '[the end of
the world'" [that aligns within a broader strategy for any potential
black freedom]{.mark}---"the comprehensive emancipation \[Fanon\] calls
for]{.underline}" (Wilderson 337). In other 79 words, if accept
Wilderson's claim that the black positionality is the slave
positionality, then the kind of undoing he suggests would lead to both
"No slave, no world" (11). However, it is also the call for undoing and,
more importantly, how he subsequently "finds his flames so incendiary"
that he "momentarily backs away" from that call that lead Wilderson to a
critique of the limits of Fanon's own revolutionary dictums (338). In
other words, Wilderson posits Fanon's duality ("the Fanon of the Slave
on the same page as the Fanon of the postcolonial subject") as the
conceptual tension between the Fanon who posits the antagonistic black
structural positionality as a global-organizational logic and the Fanon
whose longing for a reconcilable, free black subject provides
prescriptive strategies (however revolutionary) assumed to grant this
liberation (338). For Wilderson, these two Fanons are irreconcilable.
The desire for revolutionary instructions deployed from within
(communist-vanguardist) frameworks cannot account for the particularity
of antiblack violence within their prescriptions of an alternative
social order. In other words, calling for a socialist state does not
promise a world free of antiblack violence. Or, as Wilderson notes
elsewhere, Fanon's theorizations of the black psyche lead him to a
cul-de-sac where the logical end-game is an annihilation of the world as
we know it---not just an overhaul into another system that cannot
account for the particularity of antiblack violence. 13 Within this
critique rests the designation of a particular understanding of the
radical (politicized towards engaging revolutionary praxis) black body
that is constantly seeking fugitive means of liberation even if it
relies on an unknown undoing. So while Wilderson acknowledges the desire
for prescriptive models of revolutionary strategy, he also cautions us
to their allure as they suggest false promises as remedies to antiblack
violence which often mistake or substitute revolutionary models for 80
solutions to white supremacy, even while they may unconsciously
centralize and rely on threads of antiblackness for making sense of the
world.14 [[For the Panthers,]{.mark} [strategies towards black
liberation]{.mark}]{.underline} were adopted from historical
methodologies that proved incompatible with black life. However, it is
important to be able to take these strategies [as [demonstrations of
working within one's political means]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [rather than
dismiss these strategies for their naïveté]{.underline}]{.mark}. Though
my own intellectual investments (and indeed those within this project)
are very much in the spirit of Fanon's (potential) revolutionary
imaginary, I take Wilderson's critical approach to be a model of
conceptual worth. Though I meet the Panthers' politics where they are
(rather than where I myself may want them to be), I too am cautionary of
desires for prescriptive solutions within the particularities of black
subject formation in the United States. As Wilderson's work extensively
catalogs, being black in the U.S. is far different from being black
elsewhere. It is this particularity that differently conditions any
capacity for black freedom in the U.S. In the spirit of Wilderson's
approach, I contend that the Panthers' declaration of war---as embodied
within their 10 Point Program---calibrated both the threat they posed to
the sanctity of the state and capitalism as well as for the theoretical
limits these declarations perform in regards to black freedom. In his
discussion of how Blackness and the structural position of the Slave
(capitalized because of how they signal an antagonistic relationship to
ontology15) became bonded through the Middle Passage, Wilderson
contextualizes the global investments of the slave trade in order to
specify the national (U.S.) impact of its New World Order. Within this
bold introductory project, Wilderson pauses on the question of whether
black freedom is attainable, or even ontologically possible: 81 For the
Black, freedom is an ontological, rather than experiential, question.
There is no philosophically credible way to attach an experiential, a
contingent, rider onto the notion of freedom when one considers the
Black---such as freedom from gender or economic oppression, the kind of
contingent riders rightfully placed on the nonBlack when thinking
freedom. Rather, the riders that one could place on Black freedom would
be hyperbolic---though no less true---and ultimately untenable: freedom
from the world, freedom from Humanity, freedom from everyone (including
one's Black self).16 (Wilderson 23) Wilderson's grammatical attention to
the hyperbolic qualities of black liberatory demands reveals the
impossibility of thinking black freedom without calling for the end of
all existential and structural foundations---the world, Humanity,
everyone, one's Black self. The question of black freedom---the promise
of radical freedom from the durational state performances of violence
including, but not limited to, structural racism, economic poverty, and
incarceration--- is one that has plagued social movement histories
within the black radical tradition. [[The Panthers' call for
"freedom]{.mark}," [an "immediate end" to]{.mark} police [brutality and
murder of black people, and]{.mark} "land, bread, [housing,
educatio]{.mark}n, [clothing, justice, and peace" are]{.mark} at once
[declarations of war against the state because they are impossible
performative demands]{.mark} [secured within the structural logics of
white supremacy]{.mark}, the state, and capitalism (]{.underline}Foner
2-3). In other words, [if we understand blackness as a structural
positionality17 whose organizing logics exist because of antiblackness,
[then the Panthers' demands require a whole new world or---where Fanon
leads]{.mark} [Wilderson---"undoing]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Wilderson
337). 82 However, the political and conceptual frameworks the Panthers
used to make these declarations of war---and thus, destruction of the
world as we know it---did not attend to the specificities of being Black
in the U.S. I think about th[e Panthers' use of Frantz Fanon's
revolutionary treatise Wretched of the Earth in order to enter this
theoretical "cul-de-sac" and ask: What did Fanon articulate that allowed
the Panthers to identify with the need for Third World liberation? At
the same time, how did the promise of Third World liberation ultimately
prove incompatible with the state of black radical revolution in the
U.S.?]{.underline}

THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY AND
PROFESSIONALIZATION. But surely if one can write something on the
surface of the university, if one can write for instance in the
university about singularities -- those events that refuse either the
abstract or individual category of the bourgeois subject -- one cannot
say that there is no space in the university itself? Surely there is
some space here for a theory, a conference, a book, a school of thought?
Surely the university also makes thought possible? Is not the purpose of
the university as Universitas, as liberal arts, to make the commons,
make the public, make the nation of democratic citizenry? Is it not
therefore important to protect this Universitas, whatever its
impurities, from professionalization in the university? But we would ask
what is already not possible in this talk in the hallways, among the
buildings, in rooms of the university about possibility? How is the
thought of the outside, as Gayatri Spivak means it, already not possible
in this complaint? [The maroons know something about possibility. They
are [the condition of possibility of the production of knowledge in the
university]{.mark} -- the singularities against the writers of
singularity, the writers who write, publish, travel, and speak. It [is
not merely a matter of]{.mark} the secret [labor]{.mark} upon which such
space is lifted, though of course such space is lifted from collective
labor and by it. [**It is rather that to be a critical academic in the
university is to be against the university, and to be against the
university is always to recognize it and be recognized by it,** and to
institute the negligence of that internal outside]{.mark}, that
unassimilated underground, a negligence of it that is precisely, we must
insist, the basis of the professions. And [this act of being against
always already excludes the unrecognized modes of politics, the beyond
of politics already in motion, the discredited criminal
para-organization]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} what Robin Kelley might
refer to as the infrapolitical field (and its music). [It is not just
the labor of the maroons but their prophetic organization that is
negated by the idea of intellectual space in an organization called the
university. This is why the negligence of the critical academic is
always at the same time an assertion of bourgeois individualism. [Such
negligence is the essence of professionalization]{.mark} where it turns
out professionalization is not the opposite of negligence but its mode
of politics in the United States. [It takes the form of a choice that
excludes the prophetic organization of the Undercommons]{.mark} -- to be
against, to put into question the knowledge object, let us say in this
case the university, not so much without touching its foundation, as
without touching one's own condition of possibility, without admitting
the Undercommons and being admitted to it. From this, a general
negligence of condition is the only coherent position. Not so much an
antifoundationalism or foundationalism, as both are used against each
other to avoid contact with the undercommons.]{.underline} [This
always-negligent act is what leads us to say there is no distinction
between the university in the United States and professionalization.
[There is no point in trying to hold out the university against its
professionalization. They are the same.]{.mark} Yet the **[maroons
refuse to]{.mark}** refuse professionalization, that is, to **[be
against the university.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The university will not
recognize this indecision, and thus professionalization is shaped
precisely by what it cannot acknowledge, its internal antagonism, its
wayward labor, its surplus. [[Against this]{.mark} wayward labor [it
sends the critical]{.mark}, sends its [claim that what is left beyond
the critical is waste.]{.mark} But in fact, critical education only
attempts to perfect professional education. [The professions constitute
themselves in an opposition to the unregulated and the ignorant without
acknowledging the unregulated, ignorant, unprofessional labor that goes
on not opposite them but within them.]{.mark}]{.underline} But if
professional education ever slips in its labor, ever reveals its
condition of possibility to the professions it supports and
reconstitutes, critical education is there to pick it up, and to tell
it, never mind -- it was just a bad dream, the ravings, the drawings of
the mad. Because critical education is precisely there to tell
professional education to rethink its relationship to its opposite -- by
which critical education means both itself and the unregulated, against
which professional education is deployed. In other words, critical
education arrives to support any faltering negligence, to be vigilant in
its negligence, to be critically engaged in its negligence. It is more
than an ally of professional education, it is its attempted completion.
[A [professional education]{.mark} has become a critical education. But
one should not applaud this fact. It should be taken for what it [is,
not progress]{.mark} in the professional schools, not cohabitation with
the Universitas, [but counterinsurgency,]{.mark} the refounding
terrorism of law, [coming for the discredited]{.mark}, coming for those
who refuse to write of or write up the undercommons.]{.underline} [The
Universitas is always a state]{.underline}/State [strategy.]{.underline}
Perhaps it's surprising to say
[[professionalization]{.underline}]{.mark} -- that which reproduces the
professions -- [[is a state strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Certainly,
critical academic professionals tend to be regarded today as harmless
intellectuals, malleable, perhaps capable of some modest intervention in
the so-called public sphere. But to see how this underestimates the
presence of the state we can turn to a bad reading of Derrida's
consideration of Hegel's 1822 report to the Prussian Minister of
Education. Derrida notices the way that Hegel rivals the state in his
ambition for education, wanting to put into place a progressive pedagogy
of philosophy designed to support Hegel's worldview, to unfold as
encyclopedic. [This ambition both mirrors the state's ambition,
**[because it, too, wants to control education and to impose a
worldview]{.mark}**, and threatens it]{.underline}, because Hegel's
State [exceeds and thus localizes the]{.underline} Prussian [state,
exposing its pretense to **[the encyclopedic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Derrida draws the following lesson from his reading: [the
Universitas]{.underline}, as he generalizes the university (but
specifies it, too, as properly intellectual and not professional),
[**[always has the impulse of State, or enlightenment]{.mark}**, and the
impulse of state, or its specific conditions of production and
reproduction.]{.underline} Both have the ambition to be, as Derrida
says, onto- and auto-encyclopedic. It follows that to be either for the
Universitas or against it presents problems. [[To be for the Universitas
is to support this]{.mark} onto- and [auto-encyclopedic project of the
State as enlightenment]{.mark}, or enlightenment as totality, to use an
old-fashioned word. **[To be too much against the Universitas, however,
creates the danger of specific elements in the state taking steps to rid
itself of the contradiction of]{.mark}** the onto- and auto-encyclopedic
project of **[the Universitas and replacing it with some other form of
social reproduction,]{.mark}**]{.underline} the anti-enlightenment --
the position, for instance, of New Labour in Britain and of the states
of New York and California with their "teaching institutions." But a bad
reading of Derrida will also yield our question again: what is lost in
this undecidability? What is the price of refusing to be either for the
Universitas or for professionalization, to be critical of both, and who
pays that price? Who makes it possible to reach the aporia of this
reading? Who works in the premature excess of totality, in the not
not-ready of negligence? The mode of professionalization that is the
American university is precisely dedicated to promoting this consensual
choice: an antifoundational critique of the University or a foundational
critique of the university. Taken as choices, or hedged as bets, one
tempered with the other, they are nonetheless always negligent.
Professionalization is built on this choice. It rolls out into ethics
and efficiency, responsibility and science, and numerous other choices,
all built upon the theft, the conquest, the negligence of the outcast
mass intellectuality of the undercommons. [It is therefore unwise to
think of professionalization as a narrowing and better to think of it as
a circling, an encircling of war wagons around the last camp of
indigenous women and children.]{.underline} Think about the way the
American doctor or lawyer regard themselves as educated, enclosed in the
circle of the state's encyclopedia, though they may know nothing of
philosophy or history. What would be outside this act of the conquest
circle, what kind of ghostly labored world escapes in the circling act,
an act like a kind of broken phenomenology where the brackets never come
back of and what is experienced as knowledge is the absolute horizon of
knowledge whose name is banned by the banishment of the absolute. It is
simply a horizon that does not bother to make itself possible. No wonder
that whatever their origins or possibilities, it is theories of
pragmatism in the United States and critical realism in Britain that
command the loyalty of critical intellectuals. [Never having to confront
the foundation, never having to confront antifoundation out of faith in
the unconfrontable foundation, critical intellectuals can float in the
middle range. These loyalties banish dialectics with its inconvenient
interest in pushing the material and abstract, the table and its brain,
as far as it can, unprofessional behavior at its most
obvious.]{.underline}

José [[Muñoz charts the place of utopia]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
performances of and by queer subjects]{.underline}. For [Muñoz,
performativity can be best understood [as an act of "doing in the
future]{.mark}," where a particular text activates a process of
becoming-future]{.underline} (Muñoz 26, 189). Building on the notion of
the performative in a poem by James Schuyler, he writes: To "read" the
performative, along the lines of thought first inaugurated by J.L.
Austin, is implicitly to critique the epistemological. Performativity
and utopia both 77 call into question what is epistemologically there
and signal a highly ephemeral ontological field that can be
characterized as a doing in futurity. [Thus, [a manifesto]{.mark} [is a
call to]{.mark} a [doing in and for the future]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The utopian impulse to be gleaned from the poem is a call for "doing"
that is a becoming: the becoming of and for "future
generations."]{.underline} (emphasis in original, Muñoz 26) [The notion
of [calling into question]{.mark} ["what is
epistemologically]{.mark}]{.underline} [[there" and signaling]{.mark}
[an "ephemeral ontological field]{.mark}"]{.underline} [model [the work
of the Panthers']{.mark} declaration of war]{.underline} (Muñoz 26). The
formal qualities of declarations (similar to that of the manifesto)
foreground the present's incapacity to account for black freedom,
therefore [in order to [herald a vision of a world]{.mark} that
does]{.underline}, [the Panthers' use of declarations of war signal an
"ephemeral ontological field" where black freedom, perhaps, can/will
exist---at least for a moment]{.underline} in 1966 (26). A declaration
calls into question the epistemological, **[[in the service of imagining
an intangible ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words,
performativity critiques the stability of ideology in its current state
towards another way of being. In this way, the declaration is not a form
of rupture that disrupts ideology, but rather it enacts the limits of
ideology. By activating ideology's limits, I mean that [[the Panthers'
declarations articulate demands]{.mark} [that are impossible for current
state and capitalist investments to imagine,]{.mark} let alone
grant]{.underline}. In this way, **[[these performative demands]{.mark}
[suggest way to think of black freedom as an antagonistic]{.mark}
([non)ontology that requires a fundamental]{.mark} [Fanonian
"undoing]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."]{.mark} To address this "undoing" and
in order to get to a critical analysis of the Panthers' declaration of
war against the U.S. government and capitalism, I offer Frank B.
Wilderson's reading of Frantz Fanon as a generous model of critique, one
that acknowledges the epistemological limits of thinking black freedom.
Cautioning against the overwhelming 78 intellectual pressure to offer
prescriptive measures in the concluding section of one's book,
Wilderson's epilogue to Red, White, and Black utilizes Fanon's
concluding remarks to suggest another model: Frantz Fanon came closest
to the only image of sowing and harvesting that befits this book.
Quoting Aimé Césaire, he urged his readers to start "the end of the
world," the "only thing...worth the effort of starting," a shift from
horticulture to pyrotechnics. Rather than mime the restoration and
reorganization which conclusions often fall prey to, however
unwittingly, Fanon dreams of undoing, however implausible, for its own
sake. Still, there are moments when Fanon finds his own flames too
incendiary. So much so that he momentarily backs away from the
comprehensive emancipation he calls for. Which is why one can find the
Fanon of the Slave on the same page as the Fanon of the postcolonial
subject. Nonetheless, I am humbled by his efforts, and though I am
freighted with enough hubris to extend his ensemble of questions beyond
his unintentional containment strategies, I know better than to
underrate their gravitas by offering\--or even hinting at\--a roadmap to
freedom so extensive it would free us from the epistemic air we breathe.
To say we must be free of air, while admitting to knowing no other
source of breath\... (Wilderson 337-338) In this careful and deliberate
move, Wilderson allows his own theoretical divergence from Fanon to be
articulated without the pretense of eliding the subtleties within
Fanon's extensive and influential work. For Wilderson, [[it is Fanon's
call for "undoing,"]{.mark} the "start]{.underline} \[of\] '[the end of
the world'" [that aligns within a broader strategy for any potential
black freedom]{.mark}---"the comprehensive emancipation \[Fanon\] calls
for]{.underline}" (Wilderson 337). In other 79 words, if accept
Wilderson's claim that the black positionality is the slave
positionality, then the kind of undoing he suggests would lead to both
"No slave, no world" (11). However, it is also the call for undoing and,
more importantly, how he subsequently "finds his flames so incendiary"
that he "momentarily backs away" from that call that lead Wilderson to a
critique of the limits of Fanon's own revolutionary dictums (338). In
other words, Wilderson posits Fanon's duality ("the Fanon of the Slave
on the same page as the Fanon of the postcolonial subject") as the
conceptual tension between the Fanon who posits the antagonistic black
structural positionality as a global-organizational logic and the Fanon
whose longing for a reconcilable, free black subject provides
prescriptive strategies (however revolutionary) assumed to grant this
liberation (338). For Wilderson, these two Fanons are irreconcilable.
The desire for revolutionary instructions deployed from within
(communist-vanguardist) frameworks cannot account for the particularity
of antiblack violence within their prescriptions of an alternative
social order. In other words, calling for a socialist state does not
promise a world free of antiblack violence. Or, as Wilderson notes
elsewhere, Fanon's theorizations of the black psyche lead him to a
cul-de-sac where the logical end-game is an annihilation of the world as

critique rests the designation of a particular understanding of the

professional education ever slips in its labor, ever reveals its
condition of possibility to the professions it supports and
reconstitutes, critical education is there to pick it up, and to tell
it, never mind -- it was just a bad dream, the ravings, the drawings of
the mad. Because critical education is precisely there to tell
professional education to rethink its relationship to its opposite -- by
which critical education means both itself and the unregulated, against
which professional education is deployed. In other words, critical
education arrives to support any faltering negligence, to be vigilant in
its negligence, to be critically engaged in its negligence. It is more
than an ally of professional education, it is its attempted completion.
[A [professional education]{.mark} has become a critical education. But
one should not applaud this fact. It should be taken for what it [is,
not progress]{.mark} in the professional schools, not cohabitation with
the Universitas, [but counterinsurgency,]{.mark} the refounding
terrorism of law, [coming for the discredited]{.mark}, coming for those
who refuse to write of or write up the undercommons.]{.underline} [The
Universitas is always a state]{.underline}/State [strategy.]{.underline}
Perhaps it's surprising to say
[[professionalization]{.underline}]{.mark} -- that which reproduces the
professions -- [[is a state strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Certainly,
critical academic professionals tend to be regarded today as harmless
intellectuals, malleable, perhaps capable of some modest intervention in
the so-called public sphere. But to see how this underestimates the
presence of the state we can turn to a bad reading of Derrida's
consideration of Hegel's 1822 report to the Prussian Minister of
Education. Derrida notices the way that Hegel rivals the state in his
ambition for education, wanting to put into place a progressive pedagogy
of philosophy designed to support Hegel's worldview, to unfold as
encyclopedic. [This ambition both mirrors the state's ambition,
**[because it, too, wants to control education and to impose a
worldview]{.mark}**, and threatens it]{.underline}, because Hegel's
State [exceeds and thus localizes the]{.underline} Prussian [state,
exposing its pretense to **[the encyclopedic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Derrida draws the following lesson from his reading: [the
Universitas]{.underline}, as he generalizes the university (but
specifies it, too, as properly intellectual and not professional),
[**[always has the impulse of State, or enlightenment]{.mark}**, and the
impulse of state, or its specific conditions of production and
reproduction.]{.underline} Both have the ambition to be, as Derrida
says, onto- and auto-encyclopedic. It follows that to be either for the
Universitas or against it presents problems. [[To be for the Universitas
is to support this]{.mark} onto- and [auto-encyclopedic project of the
State as enlightenment]{.mark}, or enlightenment as totality, to use an
old-fashioned word. **[To be too much against the Universitas, however,
creates the danger of specific elements in the state taking steps to rid
itself of the contradiction of]{.mark}** the onto- and auto-encyclopedic
project of **[the Universitas and replacing it with some other form of
social reproduction,]{.mark}**]{.underline} the anti-enlightenment --
the position, for instance, of New Labour in Britain and of the states
of New York and California with their "teaching institutions." But a bad
reading of Derrida will also yield our question again: what is lost in
this undecidability? What is the price of refusing to be either for the
Universitas or for professionalization, to be critical of both, and who
pays that price? Who makes it possible to reach the aporia of this
reading? Who works in the premature excess of totality, in the not
not-ready of negligence? The mode of professionalization that is the
American university is precisely dedicated to promoting this consensual
choice: an antifoundational critique of the University or a foundational
critique of the university. Taken as choices, or hedged as bets, one
tempered with the other, they are nonetheless always negligent.
Professionalization is built on this choice. It rolls out into ethics
and efficiency, responsibility and science, and numerous other choices,
all built upon the theft, the conquest, the negligence of the outcast
mass intellectuality of the undercommons. [It is therefore unwise to
think of professionalization as a narrowing and better to think of it as
a circling, an encircling of war wagons around the last camp of
indigenous women and children.]{.underline} Think about the way the
American doctor or lawyer regard themselves as educated, enclosed in the
circle of the state's encyclopedia, though they may know nothing of
philosophy or history. What would be outside this act of the conquest
circle, what kind of ghostly labored world escapes in the circling act,
an act like a kind of broken phenomenology where the brackets never come
back of and what is experienced as knowledge is the absolute horizon of
knowledge whose name is banned by the banishment of the absolute. It is
simply a horizon that does not bother to make itself possible. No wonder
that whatever their origins or possibilities, it is theories of
pragmatism in the United States and critical realism in Britain that
command the loyalty of critical intellectuals. [Never having to confront
the foundation, never having to confront antifoundation out of faith in
the unconfrontable foundation, critical intellectuals can float in the
middle range. These loyalties banish dialectics with its inconvenient
interest in pushing the material and abstract, the table and its brain,
as far as it can, unprofessional behavior at its most
obvious.]{.underline}

###  AT Colonialism

#### The critique of coloniality prevents claims of a common class identity in favor of fractured resistances -- vote neg for universalism

**Chibber 14** (Vivek, associate professor of sociology at New York
University, "Postcolonial Thought's Blind Alley"
<http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=65868>)

After a long hiatus, [[we seem to be witnessing the re-emergence of a
global resistance to capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least in its
neoliberal guise. It has been more than four decades since
anti-capitalist movements exploded with such force on a global scale.
There were brief tremors every now and then that temporarily derailed
the neoliberal project. But not like those we have witnessed in Europe,
the Middle East and the Americas over the past two years.**[But the
re-emergence of such movements has revealed that [the retreat of the
past three decades has exacted a toll]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
political resources available to working people are the weakest in
decades. **[The [organisations of the left]{.mark}---unions and
political parties---[have been hollowed out]{.mark}]{.underline}** or,
worse, have become complicit in the management of austerity. **[[The
weakness]{.mark} of the left is not only political or organisational; it
[extends to theory]{.mark}. The political defeats of the past decades
have been accompanied by a dramatic churning on the intellectual
front.]{.underline}** There has not been a flight from radical theory or
commitment to a radical intellectual agenda: Self-styled progressive or
radical intellectuals are still impressive in number at many
universities, at least in North America. It is that [the very meaning of
radicalism has changed. [Under]{.mark} the influence of
[poststructuralist thinking, the basic concepts of the socialist
tradition are]{.mark}]{.underline} considered suspect or
[[rejected]{.mark} outright. [The idea that capitalism]{.mark} [has a
real structure]{.mark}]{.underline} which imposes real compulsions, that
class is rooted in real relations of exploitation, or [that [labour has
a real interest in collective organisation]{.mark}]{.underline}---ideas
that were the common sense of the left for almost two
centuries---[[are]{.mark} [considered]{.mark} hopelessly
[outdated]{.mark}.]{.underline} These criticisms of materialism and
political economy came out of the poststructuralist milieu, yet [[they
have found a particular, sharp expression in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
most recent product of that current: postcolonial theory. Over the past
two decades, the Francophone philosophical tradition has not been the
flag-bearer for the attack on materialism or political economy but
instead---and interestingly---a group of theorists from South Asia and
other parts of the global South, the most conspicuous and influential
being Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Homi Bhabha, Ranajit Guha and the
Subaltern Studies Group; also the Colombian anthropologist Arturo
[Escobar,]{.underline} Peruvian sociologist Anibal [Quijano
and]{.underline} Argentine literary theorist Walter
[[Mignolo]{.mark}.]{.underline} Their most common target is Marxist
theory, but their ire extends to the Enlightenment tradition itself. Of
all the weaknesses of Enlightenment radicalism, what most agitates
postcolonial theorists is its universalising tendencies---its claims for
the validity of certain categories, regardless of culture and place.
Marxism in their analysis is the theory that most pointedly expresses
this aspect of the Enlightenment's deadly intellectual inheritance.
Marxists insist that certain categories such as class, capitalism and
exploitation have cross-cultural validity. These categories describe
economic practices not just in Christian Europe, but also in Hindu India
and Muslim Egypt. For postcolonial theorists, this universalising zeal
is deeply problematic---as theory and, just as important, as a guide for
political practice. It is rejected as wrong, and because it supposedly
deprives actors of the intellectual resources vital for effective
political practice. In being misleading, this theory is a questionable
guide to action---any theory that is wrong will perform poorly in
directing political practice. And the theory refuses to recognise the
autonomy and creativity of actors in their particular location. Instead,
the universalising theory fits the local and particular into rigid
categories derived from European experience. [Postcolonial theory
presents itself as not just a criticism of the radical enlightenment
tradition, but as its replacement.]{.underline} "The assumption of
universalism is a fundamental feature of the construction of colonial
power because the 'universal' features of humanity are the
characteristics of those who occupy positions of political dominance,"
explains a widely used text on postcolonial studies. The mechanism
through which universalism abets colonial domination is by the elevation
of some very specific facts about European culture to the status of
general descriptions of humanity, valid on a global scale. Cultures that
do not match these specific descriptions are consigned to the status of
being backward, needing tutoring in civilisation, incapable of governing
themselves. As the text's editors describe it, the "myth of universality
is thus a primary strategy of imperial control \... on the basis of an
assumption that 'European' equals 'universal'." [[We
see]{.underline}]{.mark} in this argument [[two of the most commonly
held postcolonial theorists' views]{.mark}. One is a formal,
meta-theoretical idea: [Claims to universality are suspect
because]{.mark}]{.underline} they ignore social heterogeneity; [[they
marginalise]{.underline}]{.mark} any practice or social convention that
does not conform to what is being elevated to the universal. The act of
marginalisation is an act of suppression, of the exertion of power. [The
second view is substantive: [Universalisation is complicit with European
domination]{.mark}]{.underline}---because in the intellectual world,
western theories are dominant. Insofar as they are the frameworks that
guide intellectual inquiry, or the theories that inform political
practice, they imbue these with an enduring Eurocentrism. The frameworks
and theories inherited from the Enlightenment bear the mark of their
geographical origin. But the mark is not easily discerned. It operates
insidiously, as the hidden premise of these doctrines. The task of
postcolonial criticism is to expunge it, by exposing its presence and
highlighting its effects. [Hence the hostility to the "grand
narratives"]{.underline} associated with Marxism and progressive
liberalism. [**The [action these days is in "the fragment,"]{.mark}**
the marginal]{.underline}, the practices and cultural conventions unique
to a particular setting, which cannot be subsumed into a generalised
analysis---the "heterogeneities and incommensurabilities" of the local.
[This is where we are directed to search for political
agency.]{.underline} The hostility to universalising theories has
interesting implications. The radical tradition since Marx and Engels
has relied on foundational premises for all of its political analysis.
The first is that as capitalism expands across the globe, it imposes
economic constraints on the actors that come under its sway. As it takes
root in Asia, Latin America and Africa, economic production is forced to
abide by a common set of rules. The development of regions and the tempo
of growth will proceed unevenly, at different rates, with considerable
institutional variation. They will not all look the same. But their
differences will be worked out in response to a common set of
compulsions from the underlying capitalist structure. It is taken for
granted that as capitalism imposes its logic on actors, and exercises
its economic and political domination, it will elicit a response from
labouring groups, who will resist its depredations to defend their
wellbeing. This will be true regardless of their cultural or religious
identity. The reason for their resistance is that, whatever the facts
about local culture, capitalism assaults basic needs that all people
have in common. So just as capitalism imposes a common logic of
reproduction across regions, it also elicits a common resistance from
labour. Again, the resistance will not take the same form, but the
potential for its exercise will be universal because the wellspring that
generates it---the workers' drive to defend their wellbeing---is common
across cultures. These beliefs have been foundational for much of
radical analysis and practice for more than a century. But if we accept
postcolonial theory's injunctions against universalism, they must be
rejected as unabashedly universalistic. [The implications are profound.
[What is left of radical analysis if we lose capitalism]{.mark} from its
theoretical toolkit? How do we analyse the global depression since 2007,
or make sense of the drive for austerity]{.underline} that has swept the
Atlantic world, [if not by tracing the logic of profit-driven economies
and the struggle to maximise profits?]{.underline} [What do we make of
the global resistance to these impositions, when the same slogans can be
found in Cairo, Buenos Aires, Madison and London]{.underline}, if not
through some universal interests expressed in them[?]{.underline} How do
we generate any analysis of capitalism without some universalising
categories? The stakes being high, one would think that postcolonial
theorists might grant amnesty to concepts like capitalism or class
interests. Perhaps these are universalising categories that have some
justification, and might escape the charge of Eurocentrism. But not only
are these concepts included in the list of offenders, they are singled
out as exemplars of all that is suspect in Marxist theory. Gyan Prakash
expresses this well in a broadside against Enlightenment (Marxist)
thought: "Making capitalism the foundational theme \[of historical
analyses\] amounts to homogenising the histories that remain
heterogeneous within it." Marxists either fail to notice practices and
conventions that are independent of capitalist dynamics, or assume that
whatever independence they have will soon dissolve. The idea that social
formations can be analysed through the lens of their economic
dynamics---their mode of production---is not only mistaken, but also
Eurocentric and complicit with imperial domination. "Like many other
19th-century European ideas," Prakash notes, "the staging of the
Eurocentric mode-of-production narrative as history should be seen as an
analogue of 19th-century territorial imperialism." Dipesh Chakrabarty
has given this argument structure in his influential book
Provincializing Europe. He argues that the idea of a universalising
capitalism turns regional histories into variations on a theme. Every
country is categorised by the extent to which it conforms with, or
departs from, an idealised concept of capitalism, so regional histories
are never able to escape from being footnotes to the European
experience. The second error Chakrabarty identifies is that the idea of
capitalism evacuates all contingency from historical development.
Marxists' faith in the universalising dynamic of capitalism blinds them
to the possibility of "discontinuities, ruptures and shifts in the
historical process." Freed from interruption by human agency, the future
becomes a knowable entity, drawing toward a determinable end.
Universalising assumptions of concepts like capitalism are not just
mistaken, but politically dangerous: They disallow non-western societies
the possibility of crafting their own futures. There is no denying that,
over the past century, capitalism has spread across the globe,
imbricating itself especially in the postcolonial world. And where it
has taken root, it must have affected the institutional make-up of those
regions; their economies have been transformed by the pressures of
capital accumulation, and many of their non-economic institutions have
been changed to accommodate its logic. Chakrabarty affirms that
capitalism has globalised over the past century, but while he
acknowledges its globalisation, he denies that this is tantamount to its
universalisation. This allows him to affirm that market dependence has
spread to the far corners of the world, whilst denying that the category
of capitalism can be used for its analysis. For Chakrabarty, a properly
universalising capitalism is one that subordinates all social practices
to its own logic: "No historic form of capital, however global in its
reach, can ever be a universal \... \[for\] any historically available
form of capital is a provisional compromise" between its totalising
drive and the obduracy of local customs and conventions. In his
argument, a universalising capitalism must internalise all social
relations to its own logic. It must be a totalising system, which
refuses to allow any autonomy to other social relations. Chakrabarty
makes it seem as though capitalist managers walk around with political
Geiger counters, measuring the compatibility of every social practice
with their own priorities. The more reasonable picture is that
capitalists seek to expand their operations, make the best possible
returns on their investments, and as long as their operations are
running smoothly, do not care about the conventions and mores of the
environment. The signal that something needs to be changed comes when
aspects of the environment disrupt their operations, by stimulating
labour conflict or restricting markets. When that happens, they swing
into action, and target the culprit practices. Capitalists would be
indifferent to other practices that might well embody other "ways of
being in the world." We could reject Chakrabarty's claim that
globalisation does not imply universalisation. If the practices that
have spread globally can be identified as capitalist, then they have
also been universalised. That we can recognise them as distinctively
capitalist allows us to pronounce capital's globalisation. If we can
affirm that they are capitalist, and therefore have the properties
associated with capitalism, how can we deny their universalisation?
Capitalism spreads to all corners of the world, driven by its insatiable
thirst for profits, and in so doing it creates a truly universal
history, a history of capital. Postcolonial theorists will often pay lip
service to this aspect of global capitalism, even if they deny its
substance. What makes them more uncomfortable is the second component of
a materialist analysis, which has to do with the sources of resistance.
There is no dispute with the idea that as capitalism spreads it meets
resistance from workers, peasants fighting for their land and indigenous
populations. The celebration of these struggles is a calling card for
postcolonial theorists, and in this, they would seem to be of a piece
with the more conventional Marxist understanding of capitalist politics.
But the similarity is only on the surface. Whereas Marxists have
understood resistance from below as an expression of the real interests
of labouring groups, postcolonial theory typically shies away from any
talk of objective, universal interests. The sources of struggle are
taken to be local, specific to the culture of the labouring groups, a
product of their location and history, and not the expression of
interests linked to universal basic needs. To see struggles as emanating
from material interests is "to invest \[workers\] with a bourgeois
rationality, since it is only in such a system of rationality that the
'economic utility' of an action (or an object, relationship,
institution) defines its reasonableness." As Arturo Escobar writes,
"with poststructuralism's theory of the subject we are \... compelled to
give up the liberal idea of the subject as a self-bounded, autonomous,
rational individual. The subject is produced by \[or\] in historical
discourses and practices in a multiplicity of domains." Insofar as there
is resistance to capitalism, it must be understood as an expression of
local and particular conceptions of needs---constructed by
geographically restricted histories, and working through a cosmology
that resists translation, something that postcolonialist intellectuals
posit outside of the universalising narratives of Enlightenment thought.
The question is whether it is unwarranted to assign some universal needs
and interests to agents across cultures and time. There is no doubt
that, for the most part, the things that agents value and pursue are
culturally constructed. In this, postcolonial theorists and more
traditional progressives agree. Yet there is no culture in the world,
nor has there ever been, in which agents did not pay attention to their
physical wellbeing. Agents across localities and time are concerned for
food, shelter and safety, since the fulfilment of these needs is a
precondition for a culture's reproduction. We can affirm that there are
some aspects of human agency that are not entirely the construction of
local culture, if by that we mean that they are specific to that
culture. These aspects are rooted in aspects of human psychology across
time and space: They are components of our human nature. To say that
social agents are oriented to regard their physical wellbeing is not to
insist that culture has no influence in this domain. What they consume,
the kinds of dwellings they prefer, their sartorial inclinations, can be
shaped by local custom and the contingencies of history. It is common to
find cultural theorists pointing to the variability in forms of
consumption as evidence that needs are cultural constructions. But that
the form of consumption is shaped by history---which it might be to some
extent---is no evidence against the idea that there is a need for basic
sustenance. They are presented as forms of something. It is the agents'
concern for wellbeing that anchors capitalism in any culture where it
implants itself. As Marx observed, [once capitalist relations are in
place, the "dull compulsion of economic relations" is all it takes to
induce workers to offer themselves for exploitation.]{.underline} This
is true regardless of culture and ideology: If they are in the position
of being a worker, they will make themselves available for work. The
reason they make their labour-power available to employers is that this
is their only option to maintain their wellbeing. They are free to
refuse if their culture tells them that such practices are unacceptable,
but this only means that they are free to starve. **[[While this aspect
of human nature is the foundation on which exploitation rests, it is
also a central fount for resistance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The same
concern for wellbeing that drives workers into the arms of capitalists
also motivates them to resist the terms of their exploitation.
Employers' drive for profits has, as its most direct expression, a
constant search to minimise the costs of production. The most obvious
cost is wages. But the reduction of wages, while a condition for
increased profit margins, means a squeeze on workers' standards of
living. For some workers in high-end or unionised sectors, the squeeze
can be contained within tolerable limits, so that it amounts to a
struggle for their standard of living, but not for their basic needs.
For much of the global South and a widening range of sectors in the
developed world, the stakes are much higher. Add to this the employers'
drive to manage other costs associated with production---trying to
squeeze extra time from outdated machinery, increasing the risk of
injury to workers; the drive to speed up the pace and intensity of work;
the lengthening of the working day; the raids on pensions and retirement
benefits---and it comes up against workers' interest in their own
wellbeing. Workers' movements will often be geared to securing the basic
conditions for reproduction, not higher standards of living. The first
dimension of this process---submission to the labour contract---explains
why capitalism can take root and secure itself anywhere. The second
dimension---fighting the terms of exploitation---explains why class
reproduction begets class struggle everywhere capitalism establishes
itself. In parallel with the universalisation of capital is the
universal struggle of workers to defend their wellbeing. We have derived
both universalisms from one component of human nature. This does not
suggest that is all there is to it. Most progressive thinkers have
believed that there are other components to human nature, other needs
that span regional cultures (the need for autonomy or freedom from
coercion, for creative expression, for respect). My point is not that
human nature can be reduced to a basic, biological need. It is that this
need does exist, even if it is less exalted than others; and, more
importantly, that it can account for a range of practices and
institutions that radicals are concerned with. It is a sign of how far
left thinking has fallen that it is even necessary to defend its
reality. [[Postcolonial theory has made real gains]{.mark} in certain
domains, especially in mainstreaming literature from the global
South.]{.underline} In the 1980s and 90s it played an important role in
keeping alive the idea of anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism; and it
has made the problem of Eurocentrism a watchword among progressive
intellectuals. **[[But these achievements have come with a steep price
tag. It seems bizarre]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at a time like this,
[**[to find ourselves stuck with a theory that made its name by
dismantling]{.mark} some of the [conceptual pillars that can help us
understand the political conjuncture, and to devise effective
strategy]{.mark}.** [Postcolonial theorists have]{.mark}]{.underline}
wasted much effort tilting against windmills of their own creation, and
so have [[licensed a massive resurgence of nativism and
Orientalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is not just that they emphasise the
local over the universal. Their valorisation of the local, obsession
with cultural particularities, and insistence on culture as the
wellspring of agency, has licensed the exoticism that the left once
abhorred in colonial depictions of the non-West. Throughout the 20th
century, the anchor for anti-colonial movements was, at least for the
left, a belief that oppression was wrong wherever it was practised,
because it was an affront to basic human needs for dignity, liberty,
wellbeing. But now, **[[in the name of anti-Eurocentrism, postcolonial
theory]{.mark} has [resurrected the cultural essentialism that
progressives]{.mark} rightly [viewed as the ideological justification
for imperial domination]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[What better excuse
to deny]{.mark} peoples their [rights than to impugn the idea of]{.mark}
rights, and [universal interests, as culturally biased? No revival of
a]{.mark}n international and democratic [left is possible unless we
clear away these ideas, affirming the universalism of our common
humanity, and of the threat to it from a universalising
capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

###  AT Creativity

#### **Anti-capitalist performance fails---it gets reincorporated into the "Creativty City" where anti-capitalism itself becomes a commodity---anti-capitalist, long-term strategizing is key to prevent this.**

[In the context of the creative city, the state re-values erstwhile
unrelated and subversive initiatives in society, such as countercultural
music and art formations, co-opting their "creativity" to facilitate the
construction of the new system (Peck 2005). In Berlin, for instance,
while the anti-capitalist intent of subcultural initiatives have in the
past been regarded as inimical to mainstream development and so often
the target of revanchist policies which seek to erase and destroy them
(Smith 1996), they are now increasingly tolerated, encouraged and even
valorized as a core component in the rebuilding of the new
mainstream---the creative city (Colomb 2012, 2013).]{.underline} This is
accompanied by the opportunity for these initiatives to leverage the
system through consensus-based and collaborative planning, touted by the
state as a collective response against the "externally derived threat"
of economic insecurity (Allmendinger and Haughton 2012). This is a
system valuing negotiation and collaboration, one that can purportedly
culminate in a non-zero sum situation between states and their
dissidents. In many cases, such initiatives--- which are characterized
by their autonomous operation---have benefitted from such negotiations.
Government legislations, subsidies and collective planning procedures
are among some of the mechanisms that allow them to stake their claim to
the redeveloped creative city and emerge durably as successful cultural
commercial enterprises. They might also be given the opportunity to
establish---albeit unequally---partnerships with transnational
corporations (see Bader and Scharenberg 2010). [Such "positive" outcomes
signify the future that the once autonomous and disenfranchised can now
be part of. This is an especially compelling opportunity given the
immediate threats to their survival such formations often face. Such a
move by the state can be understood in terms of what Uitermark and
Nicholls (2013) call temporal delimitation. By providing an outlet for
engagement, states compel autonomous formations to choose between
focusing on problems that can be solved in the near future, that is,
achieving durability in the new creative city instead of
self-consciously engaging in wider and long-term struggles for
transformation that carry no guarantee: Temporal delimitation narrows
the scope and visions of associations and activists, constraining them
to prioritize short-term projects and forego real commitment to
amorphous and long-term struggles for equality. They no longer think
about long-term fights for abstract ideals of social justice but instead
focus on the daily management of social problems associated with their
target populations (Uitermark and Nicholls 2013:977).]{.underline} In
such a context, what does the durability trap entail? How is
progressiveness compromised? This can be demonstrated in two ways. The
first involves the politics of collective organization. The opportunity
for autonomous formations to remake themselves is only presented by the
state insofar as their refashioning suits its objectives[. For instance,
initiatives that are directly---artistic and musical initiatives whose
productions can constitute commercial value (see Scharenberg and Bader
2009)---or indirectly---"craftivism" initiatives that add to an overall
cool and edgy narrative (see Mould 2014)---valuable to the creative city
agenda supersede those which are deemed not valuable or antithetical,
such as formations which prioritize direct confrontation and violence
(see Flesher Fominaya 2007)]{.underline}. Given the inevitable
differences in needs and wants of constituent actors in any autonomous
formation, struggles between objectives for survival and the intent to
be radical are not uncommon (DeFilippis et al. 2006; Joseph 2002). The
added inevitability of internal hierarchy often results in a phenomenon
of vanguardism, whereby a small and more influential group leads an
autonomous formation in a top-down and ideologically driven manner,
recreating unequal relations between its constituent members (Mason and
Whitehead 2012). Here the durability trap occurs when particular groups
in an autonomous formation secure their durability at the expense of
others in the same formation. This way, an autonomous formation cannot
be progressive; it becomes a socially regressive form of "militant
particularism" prioritizing the defence of a privileged minority rather
than a universal majority (Harvey 2000). [Perpetuating discrepancies in
power, access and value is in the interest of the state because it
allows it to continually fragment any potential convergence and scaling
up of autonomous formations. This is so that governmental arrangements
can be set up to facilitate "valuable and amenable" sections of society
to serve as an extension of the government in the development and
implementation of policy, while those deemed otherwise are
systematically excluded (cf Uitermark and Nicholls 2013).]{.underline}

Contemporary art, following the diagnosis of thinkers like Amanda Beech1
and Suhail Malik2, has come to signify a paradigm of and for
indeterminacy; an indeterminacy that readily services our neoliberal
hegemonic condition, despite its claims of socio-political efficacy made
otherwise. In describing this indeterminate condition, the term
'Contemporary Art' (CA) signifies a category -- a general systemic
condition wherein the logics or modes of legitimization of the
discipline are played out, including the spectrum of production,
dissemination, economy and reception rather than the particularities of
the works of a singular artist/exhibition. [The indeterminate diagnosis
maps-out four core axioms at work within the generic condition of CA
today: art can be anything and anywhere (the Duchampian paradigm, echoed
by Jacques Rancière's indexing of the Aesthetic Regime3); it has no
definition in itself, it is semantically precarious, and only comes into
meaningful existence through the necessary correlation with a
viewer/interpreter; it is non- propositional, making no demands and
setting no criteria ('liberating' itself from 'useful'
instrumentalization); and where all of these forces combined serve as a
model of freedom (when in actuality this 'freedom' is precisely the
template at work within (neo)liberalism, and not antagonistic, nor
augmentative of it). The axiom of indeterminacy engenders a state of
idealism within CA, insofar as it claims social relevance via the
abovementioned mechanisms, but always fails at fulfilling this dream
(symptomatic of CA caught up in what Jodi Dean would call 'circuits of
drive'4, where pleasure is derived from never achieving its goal, and
what Alex Williams has]{.underline} contrasted with rational-normative
rules that could free us from the impulsions associated with drive5).
Contemporary art, in this light, operates in what Beech has described as
a tragic condition, due to its perpetual failure, whose motor consists
of a narrow interpretation of the Duchampian paradigm wherein anything
can be art, but where we are compelled to deploy critical approaches to
endlessly reform art towards an ever-expansive, albeit different art.6
The arduous call she asks of us is a more profound elaboration of the
Duchampian model; it is the challenge to construct new artistic
paradigms altogether, necessitating the affirmation of an exit from our
current axiomatic condition.

### AT Decolonization

#### The use of the rhetoric of decolonization flattens all other modes of oppression

**Wolfy UwU**

[Under the premise of 'decolonising imagination', I think we need to be
cautious with the term 'decolonising' for our context here, since it has
become a fashionable term (especially in my field of contemporary art)
applied to a host of things, and I'm afraid we may be trivialising its
actual and historical significance in addressing ongoing decolonisation
struggles that are alive and active today.]{.underline} Although in our
hegemonic conditions of geopolitical operations today, everyone is
structurally dominated by a certain economic logic, the struggles
amongst various peoples and their conditions of existence is
definitively not equivalent. I'm originally from Canada, a settler
colonial nation, and the ongoing oppression of indigenous peoples does
not compare with the general conditions of domination that govern modes
of life for the rest of the nation's people -- and these struggles
cannot be homogenized, or lumped together even if we need to find ways
of figuring solidarity across various struggles. I think part of
solidarity building demands we uphold these differences and
specificities with regards to modes of oppression -- for which I'll be
talking about the idea of a 'Solidarity without Sameness' in my talk a
bit later on. As I see it in this context, the term ['decolonising'
comes to stand in for a general experience of domination, particularly
the oppression of a neoliberal ethos, but I prefer to frame this as an
exercise in 'depetrifying imagination', so as not to flatten modes of
oppression as if they exist on a plane of equivalence, when
evidentially, they do not.]{.underline}

### AT Drive

**Their notions of repeated protest are structured by drive -- orienting
our political horizons away from communism makes the failure of current
Left politics satisfying and forecloses the political itself**

**Dean '12 (**Jodi Dean, Professor of Political Science at Hobart and
William Smith Colleges, "The Communist Horizon", Verso: Brooklyn, NY,
2012)\\\\AK

For the Left, democracy is the form the loss of communism takes. Rather
than fighting for a collective ideal, engaging in a struggle on behalf
of the rest of us, [[the Left]{.mark} repetitively [invokes democracy,
calling for what is already there]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These
invocations]{.underline}]{.mark} [of democracy [take on a
pattern]{.mark} that Lacan describes via the psychoanalytic notion of
drive]{.underline}. Like desire, [drive refers to a way that the subject
arranges her enjoyment]{.underline} (jouissance).
[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} respect to [[desire, enjoyment is what the
subject can never reach, what the subject wants but never
gets]{.underline} -- [oh, that\'s not it]{.underline}. [Drive differs in
that enjoyment comes from missing one\'s goal;]{.underline}]{.mark}
[it\'s what the subject gets, even if she doesn\'t want
it]{.underline}.22 Enjoyment is that little extra charge which keeps the
subject keeping on. [The subject\'s [repeated yet ever failing
efforts]{.mark} to reach her goal [become satisfying on their own**.**
Left appeals]{.mark} to democracy [take on the structure of the drive
insofar as they circle around and around**.** We perpetually miss our
goal and get satisfaction through this very missing]{.mark}. [Or we
don\'t even have an actual goal, and we take the absence of a goal to be
a strength. We talk, complain, and **protest**]{.mark}**.** [We make
groups on Facebook. We sign petitions and forward them to everyone in
our contact list.]{.mark} [Activity becomes passivity**,** our stuckness
in a circuit]{.mark}**,** which is then mourned as the absence of ideas
or even the loss of the political itself]{.underline} and then routed
yet again through a plea for democracy, although it doesn\'t take a
genius to know that the real problem is capitalism. [[What leftists call
the loss of the political is the fog they wander through because
they\'ve lost sight of the communist horizon]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some
contemporary theorists commend drive\'s sublimation, its substitution of
partial objects and the bits of enjoyment accompanying repetitions of a
process for the impossible object of desire. [[Multiple
voices]{.underline}]{.mark} in networked and digital media circuits, for
example, [[celebrate]{.mark} communicative capitalism for its provision
of opportunities for [small victories and momentary
pleasures]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Millions die in war and poverty, but
at least we have the internet]{.underline}]{.mark}**.** [Others admire
drive\'s creative destruction]{.underline}, the way its dissolution of
the old is the opening to the new. Admittedly, [[repeating the same act
over and over can shift from order to chaos]{.underline}]{.mark}-it\'s
one thing to scratch an itch a couple of times; [it\'s something else
entirely to claw through to the bone]{.underline}. The reiterations that
fail to respond to changes in their setting themselves change the
setting. But [the embrace of drive as destruction,]{.underline} like the
view of drive as sublimation, [treats a feature of our setting as an
alternative without drawing the necessary separation]{.underline}: [what
makes it a feature of a different formation]{.underline}, a different
politics, or even a critique? In the contemporary networks of
communicative capitalism, drive is a feedback circuit that captures our
best energies. [[Invigorating communism as a political alternative
requires amplifying the collective desire that can cut through these
affective networks]{.underline}]{.mark}**.**

### AT Embodiment

#### Their call toward embodiment demonizes the abstract as a space of theorizing in favor of locking their political imagination to the here-and-now -- all of their reasons why disembodiment is bad are reasons why the alternative reclaims it from finance capital

7\. ABSTRACTIFY Alongside the denunciation of Prometheanism, [the
Manifesto\'s proposition to accelerate [abstraction has been]{.mark}
equally cast in doubt (if not [castigated]{.mark}
outright).]{.underline} There is no doubt that [[abstract processes of
value-extraction,]{.mark} such as the increased financialization of the
economy, coupled with the division of labour across the entirety of
society]{.underline},19 [[have permeated our everyday lives with
furious]{.mark} (and exhausting) [force]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
simplistic reaction-to return to tangible and concrete modes of
life/production-does nothing more than insinuate a Fordist regression to
monotonous labour, a disavowal of development that would amount to the
same as suggesting the restoration of a purely Euclidean universe.
**[[To denounce abstraction as a malevolent force]{.mark} in itself [is
to deny the necessary role played by]{.mark} the power of [abstraction
in shaping new modes of existence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for as
Brassier reminds us, [practical (concrete) incapacities reflect
theoretical (abstract) incapacities.]{.underline}2° Furthermore, [[to
denounce abstraction is to also deny any possibility of forging
a]{.mark} \'we\' or [collective body beyond what remains immediately
perceptible]{.mark}]{.underline}-in other words, a demos. [[The
\'we\']{.mark} is always an abstraction, it [cannot be reduced to the
counting of populations]{.mark} [(all bodies cannot be concretely
experienced)]{.mark}]{.underline}; moreover, [if this \'we\' is to take
into account non-human actors, [abstraction must be accelerated so as to
accommodate new ontological positions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The issue is
not one of obliterating abstractions, since there is no concrete
essential kernel of humanity to return to; [the issue, rather, concerns
how to deploy the power of abstraction towards alternative modes of
life, distributions of exchange, production, and
consumption.]{.underline} As Matteo Pasquinelli has shown, this power of
abstraction is an inherent capacity of the organism (including the human
brain) to invent new norms in relation to dynamic surroundings,21
recalling that [a norm is not law, but a conception of
law.]{.underline}22 In this sense, [[the stagnant, alternativeless
polis]{.mark} can be diagnosed as pathological, since it [refuses to
adapt to changing epistemic conditions. Before \'abstraction\' signifies
the abstruse]{.mark} and the incomprehensible, [it indicates a drawing
awa]{.mark}y, a diversion and detachment. First and foremost,
[abstraction is a separation from what is towards what could
be]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this regard, [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
gesture of violence. [[an affirmative violence in exiting the as-it-is
condition and moving towards the generation of new connections to and
with a world.]{.mark} The power of [abstraction to experiment and revise
relations]{.mark} to each other]{.underline}, to production, to value
creation [and to the world, [is a capacity that needs to be reclaimed
beyond its colonization]{.mark} by finance capital and labour relations.
The power of abstraction to detach from existent conditions and invent
new modes of cohabitation is a force urgently in need of
acceleration.]{.underline}

###  AT High Theory

#### Academics have failed to make revolution -- critique must point toward solutions that bridge local context toward global solutions

**ANON 17**\
(#Alt-Woke Manifesto is the work of ANON. We are a collective of
"Other." Some of us are sex workers, some immigrants, many of us queer.
There are even a few privileged white cucks amongst us. Nevertheless,
ANON is largely the work and brainchild of People of Color (PoC). Our
social disciplines are as varied as our identities, from journalists to
dominatrixes. ANON are the intellectual cousins of #BlackLivesMatter
divorced from liberalism http://tripleampersand.org/alt-woke-manifesto/
rvs)

If the liberal is the evangelical, pearl clutching apostle of the woke
Left, the radical, then, is St. Augustine --- the hierophant, the
pedagogue. [[The radical is the vanguard inhabiting academia]{.mark} &
activism, creating the language and atmosphere of critique.]{.underline}
[I[ts ideologies trickle down from intellectuals]{.underline}]{.mark}
[at universities [to moderate liberals]{.mark}]{.underline} on social
media, [[and]{.mark} more recently, [the Alt-Right (e.g. culture
jamming]{.mark} by way of "meme magic" [or the synthesis of identity
politics and white nationalism]{.mark} by way of identitarianism).
[Radicals scapegoated liberals to absolve themselves of]{.mark} any
[responsibility by being all critique with no tangible
answers.]{.mark}]{.underline} The radical left in its current
incarnation is somewhat fossilized in terms of strategies and needs an
immediate remodelling. [The radical is too comfortable inhabiting only
the periphery of academia & activism. Radical academics and activists
are insulated not only by algorithms but also their obsolescence. [The
radical academic has failed to bridge the gap between intellectuals &
larger society.]{.mark}]{.underline} That is, [**[intellectuals failed
to subvert hegemony and normativity.]{.underline}** [Academics did not
do enough to reach beyond universities and make positive
reforms]{.underline}]{.mark} to public education. [[Intellectuals failed
to politicize the natural sciences]{.underline}]{.mark} early enough.
[[Intellectuals lost programming]{.mark} and hacker culture [to
neoliberalism]{.mark} & libertarians. [Computer science transitioned
from cyberpunk to Silicon Valley]{.mark} venture capitalism. Had radical
academics succeeded, there might've been more legitimacy in the
fight]{.underline} to combat climate change. Or traditional journalism
wouldn't have been so easily defeated by the post-fact information
economy. What we have now is a new Scholasticism of students &
professors as clergy dominated by an agitated, anti-intellectual
populist bloc. "Learning surrenders control to the future, threatening
established power. It is vigorously suppressed by all political
structures, which replace it with a docilizing and conformist education,
reproducing privilege as wisdom. Schools are social devices whose
specific function is to incapacitate learning, and universities are
employed to legitimate schooling through perpetual reconstitution of
global social memory. The meltdown of metropolitan education systems in
the near future is accompanied by a quasi-punctual bottom-up takeover of
academic institutions, precipitating their mutation into amnesiac
cataspace-exploration zones and bases manufacturing cyberian
soft-weaponry." Nick Land, "Meltdown" (1994) The radical activist lost
its sense resistance. There are no radicals in Congress. There are no
radical lawmakers. No radical judges. [[Community organizing is helpful,
but it's not sufficient.]{.mark} To remain relevant radicals have to
widen their scope to adapt to the changing global climate.]{.underline}
"The idea that one organisation, tactic or strategy applies equally well
to any sort of struggle is one of the most pervasive and damaging
beliefs among today's left. Strategic reflection -- on means and ends,
enemies and allies -- is necessary before approaching any political
project. Given the nature of global capitalism, [[any postcapitalist
project will require an ambitious, abstract]{.mark}, mediated, complex
and [global approach]{.mark} -- one that folk-political approaches are
incapable of providing.]{.underline}" --- Nick Srnicek and Alex
Williams, "Inventing the Future" (2015)

###  AT Humanism Bad

#### **Humanism is good---prefer our radical humanism that works best against settler colonial projects**

**Lester 12** (Alan Lester is Director of Interdisciplinary Research,
Professor of Historical Geography, and Co-Director of the Colonial and
Postcolonial Studies Network, University of Sussex, January 2012,
"Humanism, Race, and the Colonial Frontier", Transactions of the British
Institute of Geographers, Volume 37, Issue 1, Pages 144- 145,

Accessed 7-13-19)//sjp

Anderson argues that it is not an issue of extending humanity to . . .
negatively racialised people, but of putting into question that from
which such people have been excluded -- that which, for liberal
discourse, remains unproblematised. (2007, 199) [I fear, however, that
if we direct attention away from histories of humanism's failure to deal
with difference and to render that difference compatible with its
fundamental universalism, and if we overlook its proponents' failed
attempts to combat dispossession, murder and oppression; if our history
of race is instead understood through a critique of humanity's
conceptual separation from nature, we dilute the political potency of
universalism]{.underline}. [Historically, it was not humanism that gave
rise to racial innatism, it was the specifically anti-humanist politics
of settlers forging new social assemblages through relations of violence
on colonial frontiers. Settler communities became established social
assemblages in their own right specifically through the rejection of
humanist interventions. Perhaps, as Edward Said suggested, we can learn
from the implementation of humanist universalism in practice, and insist
on its potential to combat racism, and perhaps we can insist on the
contemporary conceptual hybridisation of human--non-human entities too,
without necessarily abandoning all the precepts of humanism (Said 2004;
Todorov 2002).]{.underline} [We do not necessarily need to accord a
specific value to the human, separate from and above nature, in order to
make a moral and political case for a fundamental human universalism
that can be wielded strategically against racial violence]{.underline}.
Nineteenth century humanitarians' universalism was fundamentally
conditioned by their belief that British culture stood at the apex of a
hierarchical order of civilisations. From the mid-nineteenth century
through to the mid-twentieth century, this ethnocentrism produced what
Lyotard describes as 'the flattening of differences, or the demand for a
norm (''human nature'')', that 'carries with it its own forms of terror'
(cited Braun 2004, 1352). The intervention of Aboriginal Protection
demonstrates that humanist universalism has the potential to inflict
such terror (it was the Protectorate of Aborigines Office reincarnated
that was responsible, later in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
for Aboriginal Australia's Stolen Generation, and it was the
assimilationist vision of the Protectors' equivalents in Canada that led
to the abuses of the Residential Schools system). [But we must not
forget that humanism's alternatives, founded upon principles of
difference rather than commonality, have the potential to do the same
and even worse.]{.underline} In the nineteenth century, Caribbean
planters and then emigrant British settlers emphasised the multiplicity
of the human species, the absence of any universal 'human nature', the
incorrigibility of difference, in their upholding of biological
determinism. Their assault on any notion of a fundamental commonality
among human beings has disconcerting points of intersection with the
radical critique of humanism today. [The scientific argument of the
nineteenth century that came closest to post-humanism's insistence on
the hybridity of humanity, promising to 'close the ontological gap
between human and non-human animals' (Day 2008, 49), was the
evolutionary theory of biological descent associated with Darwin, and
yet this theory was adopted in Aotearoa New Zealand and other colonial
sites precisely to legitimate the potential extinction of other,
'weaker' races in the face of British colonisation on the grounds of the
natural law of a struggle for survival (Stenhouse 1999]{.underline}).
Both the upholding and the rejection of human-- nature binaries can thus
result in racially oppressive actions, depending on the contingent
politics of specific social assemblages. [Nineteenth century colonial
humanitarians, inspired as they were by an irredeemably ethnocentric and
religiously exclusive form of universalism, at least combatted
exterminatory settler discourses and practices at multiple sites of
empire, and provided spaces on mission and protectorate stations in
indigenous peoples could be shielded to a very limited extent from
dispossession and murder]{.underline}. [They also, unintentionally,
reproduced discourses of a civilising mission and of a universal
humanity that could be deployed by anticolonial nationalists in other
sites of empire that were never invaded to the same extent by settlers,
in independence struggles from the mid-twentieth century.]{.underline}
Finally, as Whatmore's (2002) analysis of the Select Committee on
Aborigines reveals, they provided juridical narratives that are part of
the arsenal of weapons that indigenous peoples can wield in attempts to
claim redress and recompense in a postcolonial world. The politics of
humanism in practice, then, was riddled with contradiction, fraught with
particularity and latent with varying possibilities. It could be
relatively progressive and liberatory; it could be dispossessive and
culturally genocidal. Within its repertoire lay potential to combat
environmental and biological determinism and innatism, however, and this
should not be forgotten in a rush to condemn humanism's universalism as
well as its anthropocentrism. [It is in the tensions within universalism
that the ongoing potential of an always provisional, self-conscious,
flexible and strategic humanism -- one that now recognises the
continuity between the human and the non-human as well as the powerladen
particularities of the male, middle class, Western human subject --
resides.]{.underline}

### AT Institutions Bad

#### Outside organizations and existing institutions must work together---sole focus on one kills revolutionary movements

**Bensaïd 11** (Daniel Bensaïd, July 5th 2011, "Strategy and Party",
translation by Nathan Rao, International Viewpoint,
<http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/IMG/article_PDF/article_a2198.pdf>,
Accessed 7-14-19, pages 4-6)//sjp

[For starters, any notion of revolutionary strategy has to begin with
the idea that the class struggle has rhythms; there is ebb and flow, but
there are especially periods of crisis during which the relationship of
forces can be radically altered, creating the possibility of changing
the world or at least changing society.]{.underline} There is a second
fundamental idea (and these are very general points) stemming from all
the victorious or defeated revolutionary experiences that one looks at
in the 19th or 20th century - from the Paris Commune through to the
Carnation Revolution in Portugal and the Unidad Popular experience in
Chile. [In every situation of more or less revolutionary crisis, forms
of dual power emerge - that is to say, organs of power that are external
to existing institutions.]{.underline} [In Italy in 1920-1921, it was
factory councils; in Russia, it was the soviets; in Germany in 1923, it
was the workers councils; in Chile in 1971-1973, it was the cordones
industriales (workers committees) and comandos comunales (neighbourhood
committees); and in Portugal in 1975, it was the neighbourhood and
occupied-factory committees, which reached their high point at the
Setubal assembly]{.underline}. [Every case of intense class struggle
leads to the emergence of organs of what we call self-organization - of
democratic organization specific to the people and to workers, and which
counterpose their legitimacy to that of existing institutions. That
doesn\'t mean there is absolute opposition between the two]{.underline}.
All through the year 1917, the Bolsheviks combined the demand for a
constituent assembly elected through universal suffrage with the
building of the soviets. There is a transfer of legitimacy from one
organ to the other that is anything but automatic[. You have to
demonstrate in practise that the organs of people\'s power are more
effective in a time of crisis - more democratic and more legitimate than
the institutions of the bourgeoisie. But there can be no truly
revolutionary situation without the appearance of at least some elements
of what we call the duality of power or dual power]{.underline}. The
third idea is that of winning majority support as a pre-condition for
revolution. What sets a revolution apart from a putsch or coup d\'état
is that it is a movement that has the support of a majority of the
population. We have to follow to the letter the notion that the
emancipation of workers will be achieved by workers themselves; and
that, however determined and courageous revolutionaries may be, they
cannot make a revolution in the name of the majority of the population.
This was a major debate at the initial congresses of the Communist
International, especially at the third and fourth congresses following
the disaster of what was called the March Action in Germany in 1921 -
which had indeed been a minority, putschist action (on the scale of the
whole country, that is, while still involving several hundreds of
thousands of people). This led to a debate in the Communist
International in relation to those who thought they would be able to
mechanically copy the Russian Revolution. The point was to say that
there was no getting around winning over a majority of the population.
This wasn\'t about election results --- since it wasn\'t a matter of
being legalistic and saying that nothing can be done so long as we
haven\'t won a majority in parliament --- but rather about winning
legitimacy in the eyes of a majority among the masses, which is a
different matter. [If you read Trotsky\'s History of the Russian
Revolution - and it remains a useful book to read - you\'ll see how he
is alert even to the slightest shift on the municipal level, in local
elections and so on]{.underline}. In his eyes, these are indicators of
the kinds of possibilities that are developing among the masses. Winning
over a majority became a central issue in the Communist International
from the third congress of 1921 onward, with the debate giving rise to
such notions as the united front, transitional demands and, later on,
especially with Gramsci, hegemony. It is a matter of winning hegemony;
revolution cannot be reduced to the confrontation between capital and
labour at the workplace. [It is also about the proletariat\'s ability to
demonstrate that another society is possible, with the proletariat
itself as the driving force behind that endeavour]{.underline}. This
must be demonstrated to some degree before the seizure of power lest
this be a leap into the unknown, a half-hearted running jump, a
smash-and-grab or a putsch. So the notion of transitional demands and
that of the united front are tools for winning over a majority. The
notion of transitional demands may seem elementary. In France, we have
been very happy with the Olivier Besancenot presidential campaign but,
really now, a minimum wage of 1500 euros per month and a better
distribution of wealth are not very revolutionary demands. [A few years
ago, they would even have seemed very reformist. They seem radical today
because the reformists don\'t even bother with such things anymore.
Demands and slogans don\'t have any magical virtues; they have no
inherent value outside a given situation, as the starting point for a
newly awakened consciousness.]{.underline} When we say that you can\'t
live decently in a country like France with less than 1500 euros per
month, we are told that we aren\'t realistic and that if we increase
wages there will be capital flight. That raises another question: how
can we prevent capital flight? We have to tackle financial speculation
and private property. [The right to housing raises the question of
private property in land and real estate. So these are demands that, at
a given point in time, crystallize problems that people can understand
and that can be used as springboards to mobilize thousands or hundreds
of thousands of people. This in turn makes it possible to learn
incrementally through action --- and not only from words and speeches -
about the logic of the capitalist system and why even such elementary
and legitimate demands collide head-on with this logic.]{.underline}
This debate may seem elementary to you today. But in the debates of the
Communist International, those who wanted to copy the Russian Revolution
called for the immediate arming of the proletariat. Yes, of course, in
order to resist the enemy it does indeed have to come to that. [But
before getting to that point, there first has to be a thoroughgoing
awakening of consciousness that starts from the most basic demands such
as the sliding scale of wages, the sharing of work time, and so forth.
These may be very straightforward for us, but were anything but a
foregone conclusion at the time. They were the subject of very heated
and very persistent debates in the Communist International. When it
comes to demands seen as necessary and fundamental by most people, we
call for the broadest unity among all those prepared to wage a serious
struggle in their support. This is why transitional demands are linked
to the question of the united front.]{.underline} [We know full well
that reformists won\'t see things through to the very end. We know that
they will yield to threats and capitulate outright if capital hands them
an ultimatum. Still, the journey together will be of pedagogical value
to those who really do want to struggle to the very end in defence of
basic needs and culture - the right to decent living conditions, health,
education, housing and so forth. Forward strides can be made on this
basis.]{.underline} Finally, the fourth idea is that since we don\'t
think that a revolution can lead to a more egalitarian society in one
country alone, hemmed in by the world market, we seek to build an
international relationship of forces from the outset. Building an
international movement is part of the program. This takes the form of an
International if possible, but also networks such as the European
Anti-Capitalist Left, meetings of the revolutionary Left in Latin
America, and so forth. This is not a technical matter; it\'s the
translation into practise of a political approach to the international
character of revolution.

### AT Identity Politics

**Identity politics creates divisions by focusing on individual
relations to power instead of collective relations**

**Haider '18** (Asad Haider, 1/7/18, Founding Editor of Viewpoint
Magazine, PhD candidate in History of Consciousness at UC Santa Cruz and
member of UAW-2865, the Student-Workers Union at the UCal, "Mistaken
Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump", Verso Books, p.
19-20)\\\\AK

In its contemporary ideological form, [rather]{.underline} [than its
initial form]{.underline} [as a]{.underline} theorization of a
[revolutionary political practice]{.underline}, [[identity politics is
an individualist method]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is [based on
the]{.underline} individual's [demand for recognition]{.underline}, and
it takes that individual's identity as its starting point.
[[It]{.mark}]{.underline} takes this identity for granted and
[[suppresses]{.mark} the fact that [all identities are socially
constructed]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [because]{.underline} [all of
us]{.underline} necessarily [have an identity that is different from
everyone else's]{.underline}, it undermines the possibility of
[collective self-organization.]{.underline} [[The
framework]{.underline}]{.mark} of identity [[reduces politics
to]{.mark}]{.underline} who [you]{.underline} are [as an individual
and]{.underline} to [[gaining recognition as an individual]{.mark},
[rather than]{.mark} your membership in a [collectivity]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the collective [struggle against an oppressive]{.mark}
social [structure.]{.mark}]{.underline} As a result, [identity politics
[paradoxically]{.mark} ends up [reinforcing]{.mark} [the very norms it
set out to criticize]{.mark}]{.underline}. While this redefinition may
seem drastic, [this kind of shift in meaning is typical of political
language]{.underline}, which ­­does not always clearly align with
political practice. A word like nationalism, for example, ends up
revealing irreconcilable divisions. It eventually requires modification,
and we may end up deciding that it has to be abandoned in favor of new
and more adequate terms. Indeed, nationalism was precisely the
epistemological obstacle that drove Barbara Smith to the kind of
politics that would frame the CRC. She recalled: I went to a major
[antiwar mobilization]{.underline} in Washington, D.C., [in]{.underline}
the fall of 19[69]{.underline} ... I thought it was the last
demonstration I'd ever go to; one of the reasons being [black
people]{.underline} back at Pitt had so many nasty things to
[say]{.underline} about the fact [that I was involved in]{.underline}
what they say was a ["white" entity, namely, the antiwar
movement]{.underline} ... it was a very hard time to be a politically
active black woman, who did not want to be a pawn ... I actually
imagined that I would never be politically active again because
nationalism and patriarchal attitudes within black organizing was so
strong.29 [[The]{.mark} CRC's]{.underline} initiating
[[purpose]{.underline} [was]{.underline}]{.mark} [precisely [to
overcome]{.mark} these degrading and depoliticizing
[divisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. "I firmly believe [there has to be
space [for]{.mark}]{.underline} us all in our [[myriad
identities]{.mark} and dimensions]{.underline}," Demita Frazier would
later reflect. "[[You]{.underline}]{.mark} run the
[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of having [[an identity become
crystallized]{.mark} [and contained]{.mark} and [requiring]{.mark}
everyone to be [conformists.]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} This tension
also existed within the CRC. Class differences internal to the group
were a challenge in maintaining democratic forms of organization,
Frazier recalls: Class was another huge issue that we looked at and yet
in some way could not come to grips with. We had an analysis based on
our own socialist leanings and a socialist democratic view of the world,
and yet, when it came right down to it, we had many women who felt
excluded because they felt they didn't have the educational background
and privilege of the leadership. Just as significant was the question of
relating to other groups, especially other feminist groups. The
[[women's liberation]{.mark} movement [had been perceived as
white]{.mark} from the outset]{.underline}, and part of [[the
purpose]{.mark} of the CRC]{.underline} [[was to
insist]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[black women could articulate their
own feminism]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[this did
not]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily [[mean maintaining rigid divisions
from white fem]{.mark}inists, [or]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed [[forming
a crystallized black identity]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Frazier's own
words: One of the things that has always troubled me is that [I wanted
to be part of a multicultural feminist organization]{.underline}, a
multicultural feminist movement, and I never felt that the feminist
movement became fully integrated ... It isn't that Combahee didn't work
in coalition with other groups, but we [weren't able to make those
linkages across culture]{.underline} and make them [as firm as I hoped
they could be]{.underline}.30 The [problem of coalitions is felt acutely
by anyone who has experienced the trials and tribulations of political
practice]{.underline}. My own experiences with the rise and fall of
coalitions convinced me of the perspective of the scholar of black
British culture Paul Gilroy: "Action against racial hierarchies can
proceed more effectively when it has been purged of any lingering
respect for the idea of 'race. ' "31

**An ethos of [individuality]{.underline} and [individual
empowerment]{.underline} actively sustains neoliberal power---creating

[feasible strategy]{.underline} of resistance in the Trump era**

Johanna Brenner's reading of my essay misses the centrality of the
problem of hegemony. My main point was that [the current dominance of
finance capital was not achieved only by force but also by]{.underline}
what Gramsci called ["consent."]{.underline} [Forces favoring
financialization, corporate globalization, and deindustrialization
succeeded in taking over the Democratic Party]{.underline}, I claimed,
[by presenting those patently anti-labor policies as
progressive]{.underline}. [[Neoliberals gained power by]{.mark} draping
their project in a new [cosmopolitan ethos]{.mark}, [centered on
diversity, women's empowerment, and LGBTQ rights]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Drawing in supporters of such ideals, they [forged a new hegemonic
bloc]{.mark}, which I called]{.underline} [progressive
neoliberalism]{.underline}. In identifying and analyzing this bloc, I
never lost sight of the power of finance capital, as Brenner claims, but
offered an explanation for its political ascendance. [The lens of
hegemony also sheds light on the position of social movements vis-à-vis
neoliberalism]{.underline}. Instead of parsing out who colluded and who
was coopted, I focused on the widespread shift in progressive thinking
from equality to meritocracy. [Saturating the airwaves in recent
decades, that thinking influenced not only liberal feminists and
diversity advocates who knowingly [embrace]{.mark}d its [individualist
ethos]{.mark}, but also many within social movements]{.underline}. Even
[those]{.underline} whom Brenner calls social-welfare feminists [found
something to identify with in [progressive
neoliberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and in doing so, [turned a blind
eye to its contradictions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [To say this is not to
blame them]{.underline}, as Brenner contends, [but to clarify how
hegemony works---by drawing us in---in order to figure out how [best to
build a counterheg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}. [The latter idea supplies
the standard for assessing the fortunes of the left]{.underline} from
the 1980s to the present. [Revisiting that period, Brenner surveys an
impressive body of leftwing activism]{.underline}, which she supports
and admires, as do I. [But it does not detract from that admiration to
note that this activism never rose to the level of a
counterhegemony]{.underline}. [It did not succeed]{.underline}, that is,
[in presenting itself as a credible alternative to progressive
neoliberalism]{.underline}, nor in replacing the latter's view of who
counts as "us" and who as "them" with a view of its own. To explain why
this was the case would require a lengthy study, but one thing at least
is clear: [unwilling to frontally challenge progressive-neoliberal
versions of feminism, anti-racism, and multiculturalism, leftwing
activists were never able to reach the "reactionary
populists]{.underline}" (that is, industrial working-class whites) [who
ended up voting for Trump]{.underline}. [[Bernie]{.underline}]{.mark}
Sanders [is the [exception]{.mark} that [proves the
rule]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though far from perfect, his campaign
directly challenged established political fault lines. By targeting "the
billionaire class," [he reached out to those abandoned by progressive
neoliberalism]{.underline}, addressing communities struggling to
preserve "middle-class" lives as victims of a "rigged economy" who
deserve respect and are capable of making common cause with other
victims, many of whom never had access to "middle-class" jobs. [At the
same time, Sanders split off a good chunk of those who had gravitated
toward progressive neoliberalism]{.underline}. Though defeated by
Clinton, [he [pointed the way to a potential
counterheg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}: [in place of the
progressive-neoliberal alliance of financialization plus emancipation,
he [gave]{.mark} us a [glimpse of a new]{.mark}, "progressive-populist"
[bloc combining emancipation with social
protection]{.mark}]{.underline}. In my view, [the Sanders option
[remains the only principled and winning strategy in the era of
Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}. [To those who are now mobilizing under the
banner of "resistance," I suggest the counter-project of "course
correction]{.underline}." Whereas the first suggests a doubling down on
progressive-neoliberalism's definition of "us" (progressives) versus
"them" (Trump's "deplorable" supporters), [the second means [redrawing
the political map]{.mark}]{.underline}---[by forging common cause among
all whom his administration is set to betray]{.underline}: not just the
[immigrants]{.underline}, [feminists]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[people of color]{.underline} [who voted against him]{.underline}, [but
also]{.underline} the [rust-belt]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[Southern working-class strata]{.underline} [who voted for
him]{.underline}. Contra Brenner, [the point is not to dissolve
"identity politics" into "class politics]{.underline}." [It is to
clearly identify the shared roots of class and status injustices in
financialized capitalism, and to [build alliances among those who must
join together]{.mark} to fight against both of them]{.underline}.

#### Focus on "identity politics" undermines [collective resistance]{.underline}

Donald [Trump won]{.underline} in no small part [thanks to crucial votes
cast by downwardly mobile white people across America\'s]{.underline}
shattered [manufacturing belt]{.underline}. The media narrative
describing a massive rightward shift by these voters might be an
oversimplification. But the fact remains that [a big chunk of a
demographic that supported Barack Obama in 2012 voted for Trump or a
third party this year, or else stayed home]{.underline}. As a result, a
renewed debate over whether to mobilize the "white working class" is
roiling the Democratic Party (and those to its left). The New York Times
framed the question like this: "Should the party continue tailoring its
message to the fast-growing young and nonwhite constituencies that
propelled President Obama, or make a more concerted effort to win over
the white voters who have drifted away?" We might instead frame it like
this: [People from left to center are engaging in heated, rarely helpful
and often [confused conversations about "identity
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}" [that [present false
choices]{.mark}]{.underline} [about how to move forward]{.underline}.
[In the wake of Trump's inauguration]{.underline}, the debate has become
somewhat muted as left to [liberal resistance has [coalesced into
persistent]{.mark}, multifaceted and enormous nationwide
[protest]{.mark} movements]{.underline}.
[[Disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [will no doubt reemerge and
continue to [fracture the left wing of this
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While internal debate is productive,
[a united front is crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At issue is not only
the future of the Democratic Party but, more broadly, the strategies of
political resistance and social mobilization]{.underline}
[under]{.underline} a [Trump]{.underline} presidency [and the future of
an independent Left that has now set its sights on winning
power]{.underline}. Some liberal writers, like Rebecca Traister, are
concerned that appealing to white workers will ultimately distance the
Democratic Party from the "women and people of color" who make up its
base. Meanwhile, other liberals, hostile to "identity politics" but by
no means leftists---intellectual historian Mark Lilla, for
example---argue that "[American liberalism has slipped into a kind of
moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity]{.underline}." On
the socialist left, Shuja Haider and [others skewer "[identity
politics]{.mark}" for [dividing the collective "we" necessary for
revolutionary politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} The first argument assumes
that a focus on class entails a narrow focus on the grievances of white
workers and the abandonment of a diverse Democratic constituency; the
second and third that narrow identitarian appeals undermine the more
encompassing identity ("Americans as Americans" per Lilla; the "working
class" for socialist critics) required for a successful liberal or left
coalition. Ironically, despite their vehement disagreement over whether
"identity politics" should be the mobilizing strategy, all three
positions presume the same neoliberal framing of identity
politics---positing a zero-sum game between individual groups with
narrow and mutually opposed interests---that has guided the liberal
establishment for decades. All three arguments are misconceived because
they construe identity as atomistic, and thus misunderstand the
relationship between what they call "identity" and class. Contemporary
American capitalism is a system structured by race, gender and unequal
citizenship---from housing segregation to the unremunerated second shift
worked by women to the growth of the low-wage service sector and its
impact on immigrants and women and on men displaced from manufacturing.
Those who are marginalized on account of their race, gender or
immigration status---or some combination thereof---are
disproportionately more likely to be poor and working-class. A
working-class political program should buttress rather than exclude the
struggles of marginalized groups. By pitting race and gender against
class, some liberals' eschewal of class-based mobilization and others'
dismissal of "identity politics" ensure electoral defeat for the
Democratic Party. And insofar as this zero-sum understanding of identity
resonates among leftists committed to class struggle, it threatens to
sow divisions among those working towards economic and social
justice---divisions we can scarcely afford given the militaristic,
xenophobic, and plutocratic agenda pursued by the White House. A
clarification of terms, and of history, is in order. "Identity politics"
vs. "neoliberal identity politics" Contra anti-"PC" crusaders like
Lilla, the problem is not that liberals are excessively focused on the
rights of queer and non-white people---as Lilla claims in a
mean-spirited aside targeting transgender people, that liberals spend
too much time focusing on bathrooms. Nor, in its left variant, is the
problem that a universally conceived class identity ought to supersede
particularistic group identities. Achieving a sense of shared class
identity, as socialists from Karl Marx to E. P. Thompson have long made
clear, has always proved a challenging task. And not just because of the
way capitalism drives a wedge between workers along lines of race,
gender, religion and ethnicity---from white male-dominated craft
unions\' exclusion of women and people of color to white supremacy
stymying unionization drives in the South. Capitalism also fragments
working-class identity by pitting workers against one another as they
compete over jobs and wages, and hierarchizes them by trade and rank. It
downplays people's role as workers and valorizes their identities as
individual consumers. Capitalism, and not struggles for racial or gender
justice, is what preemptively undermines the potential for shared and
cohesive class identity among the working-class majority. Indeed,
"identity politics" isn't the problem at all. The debate shouldn\'t be
about whether "identity politics" is a good or bad thing, but rather
over the term\'s very different and too rarely explicated meanings. As
suggested by the recent proliferation of references to the "white
working class," identity politics does not exclusively refer to groups
marginalized on account of their race or gender. Rather, identity
politics is implicated in all mass politics. People interpret their
conditions and their interests in relation to historically constructed
collective identities. Whether it be a black McDonald's worker who
thanks to Fight for 15 comes to understand the links between poverty
wages and mass incarceration or a white machinist who witnesses a boss
use a co-worker's immigration status as leverage against a unionization
drive, identities are never etched in stone but contingent on political
and social context. Contra leftists who implicitly assume that class
identity would magically cohere if workers were not divided by race or
gender, the success of any political movement depends on both resonating
with existing identity categories and, as struggles and conditions
evolve, forming new ones. For leftists, then, the critical issue is not
whether "identity" is the basis for politics, but rather how identities
are articulated, and whose identities are being mobilized, in what ways,
and toward which ends. [The neoliberal variant of identity politics
ascendant in recent decades is successful in articulating and mobilizing
atomized identities, but it is an [obstacle to building broad movements
grounded in solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline} [because it regards those
identities as mutually opposed units]{.underline}. [This
politics]{.underline}, adopted as a political strategy by segments of
the Democratic establishment and uncritically reinforced by its critics,
[is radically [non-intersectional]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It [assumes
that social groups]{.mark}---say, gay or black---[are homogeneous
monoliths with uniform interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And when class
isn't taken into account, socialist critics rightly note that "identity
politics" has become a [vehicle for the interests of elite
leaders]{.mark} who substitute diversity]{.underline} in the White House
and [on Wall Street for substantive justice]{.underline}. [Poor black
people and poor white people both face increasing economic precarity and
thus share many of the same grievances]{.underline}. Conversely, wealthy
black elites share economic interests with wealthy people as a
whole---interests opposed to those of the much larger number of black
people who are economically marginalized. The same goes for wealthy
women or wealthy LGBTQ people. [The fact of intersecting identity need
not [devolve into infinite fragmentation]{.mark}. Rather, intersections
can orient individuals and communities toward others precisely through
those points of particularity and difference]{.underline}---nodes [that,
when linked, can strengthen people's bonds instead of breaking
them]{.underline}. This debate is not merely semantic. For the last 25
years, neoliberal identity politics has not only hurt poor and working
class people but confused the Left's explanation as to why it has
happened.

#### Identity politics trade off with successful alternatives to capitalism

**Herod '7** (James Herod, Columbia U graduate and political activist,
"Getting Free" Pg. 33, <https://libcom.org/files/Getting%20Free.pdf>)

[The]{.underline} so-called [new social movements, based on gender,
racial, sexual, or ethnic identities, cannot destroy
capitalism.]{.underline} In general, [they haven't even
tried]{.underline}. Except for a tiny fringe of radicals in each of
them, they have been attempting to get into the system, not overthrow
it. T[his is true for women, blacks, homosexuals, and ethnic (including
Anative) groups, as well as many other identities old
people]{.underline}, people with disabilities, mothers on welfare, and
so forth. Nothing has derailed the anticapitalist struggle during the
past quarter century so thoroughly as have these movements. Sometimes it
seems that identity politics is all that remains of the left. Identity
politics has simply swamped class politics. The mainstream versions of
[these movements]{.underline} (the ones fighting to get into the system
rather than overthrow it) [have given capitalists a chance to do a
little fine-tuning by eliminating tensions here and there, and by
including token representatives of the excluded groups]{.underline}.
Many of the demands of these movements can be easily accommodated.
[Capitalists can live with boards of directors exhibiting ethnic,
gender, and racial diversity]{.underline} as long as all the board
members are procapitalist. [Capitalists can easily accept a rainbow
cabinet as long as the cabinet is pushing the corporate
agenda]{.underline}. So mainstream [identity politics has not threatened
capitalism at all]{.underline}. The radical wings of the new social
movements, however, are rather more subversive. [These militants
realized that it was necessary to attack the whole social order in order
to uproot racism and sexism problems that could not be overcome under
capitalism]{.underline} since they are an integral part of it. [There is
no denying the evils of racism, sexism, and nationalism, which are major
structural supports to ruling-class control]{.underline}. These
militants have done whatever they could to highlight, analyze, and
ameliorate these evils. Unfortunately, for the most part, their voices
have been lost in all the clamor for admittance to the system by the
majorities in their own movements.

#### Race is a tool of capital -- orients white workers against others through racial categorization which prevents solidarity

**Hart 18** (William David, William David Hart (PhD, Princeton
University, 1994) is professor of religious studies and department head
at the University of North Carolina Greensboro. Hart is a "critical
theorist of religion" whose interests include the construction of
religion and its ethical-political uses, "Constellations: Capitalism,

Theology & Philosophy, Volume 39, Number 1, January 2018, pp. 5-33,
https://muse.jhu.edu/article/691691/pdf)

On my reading, the figures in the left column tend toward the more
conventional view that [racism, race, and antiblackness are, in the last
analysis, capitalist ideologies and practices. They are tools of labor
exploitation and management: capitalists undermine working-class
solidarity by splitting workers along racial lines]{.underline}; they
[convince white workers that whiteness rather than class solidarity is
the true guardian of their interests]{.underline}.
[Employing]{.underline} the tool of a [racially stratified labor
market,]{.underline} [capitalists convince]{.underline} white workers,
including the petit bourgeoisie19 (shopkeepers, police officers,
firefighters, lower-level clerical workers, and others striving to
become members of the upper middle class, that is, the very people who
constitute the bedrock of President Trump's support20), [that any
economic and status gains black workers make comes at their
expense.]{.underline} In a competitive labor market, which reduces
workers across racial lines to the same status[, the metaphysics of
whiteness is the only thing that stands between white workers and black
workers in a society where honor and dishonor are racially
coded]{.underline}. DuBois called this [ideology of honor and dishonor,
this zero-sum racial logic, the "wages of whiteness]{.underline}." These
wages are compensatory and psychological; [the wages that white workers
receive by identifying their interests in terms of racial membership
rather than class solidarity]{.underline}. [Their bosses may exploit
them through low wages and meager benefits. But at least they are not
black]{.underline}. White elites in Hollywood and the culture industries
may trash their image. But at least they are not black. Upper and middle
class whites may call them "white trash." But at least they are not
black (this affirmation or denial notwithstanding, the fear of "falling"
into blackness, of racialization, which the slur "white trash" signals,
is intense).

#### Identity politics generates scapegoating that distracts us from capitalism

technology and technology transfer, equality thinking, moral and
political economics, and long-term development, 2018, "Authority vs
power: capitalism, archaeology and the populist challenge," p.
526-527)/ruwur

Concerning the issue of identity, we concur that [gender and race cannot
be disentangled from class and the genealogy of capitalist
modernity]{.underline}. [We must move away from the depoliticised
multicultural identity politics that have so far prevailed, and that
have left the structural homogeneity of capitalism intact.]{.underline}
It is necessary to reinsert race, sex and gender into the political
economy of capitalism. We oppose [the critical energy spent in fighting
for the recognition of reified forms of difference]{.underline}, which
[end up fuelling the populist capacity to **create scapegoats and to
gain public support**.]{.underline} Regarding the universalising
character of our proposal, emancipatory politics have always been
universal in their aspirations, as is the decolonised archaeology
proposed by Hamilakis. The problem is not universalism per se---it is
defining what kind of universal values are defended. The universalism we
advocate is counter to the fragmentation and localisation of struggles
promoted by multiculturalism. Smith and Campbell accuse us of making a
straw person argument against Critical Heritage Studies (CHS) before
engaging in a straw fallacy themselves. Some of their criticisms are
easy to dismiss. We never, for example, argued that there has been
little examination of what "these marginalised communities think about
archaeology and heritage" (above). There is, of course, much research on
heritage and subaltern communities---but not those to which we refer:
the supporters of, for example, President Trump, Brexit or European Far
Right groups. More questionable is Smith and Campbell's claim that we
overlook the extensive literature on communities recognising their
political diversity. [The problem here is that these communities, while
comprising a variety of interest groups that often disagree, are rarely
portrayed as being fractured by irresolvable antagonisms. It is
horizontal differences (typical of identity politics), rather than
vertical antagonisms, that are emphasised]{.underline} (Žižek 2001).

### AT Imagination

**Neoliberalism turns their dreams into nightmares -- affirming
(imagination, creativity, dreaming) cedes ethical and practical
implications to the status quo, orienting the aff's praxis back to offer
capitalism its newest form -- particularly true in the context of

Introduction: Malcreativity [[Allowing imagination]{.mark} and intuition
[to lead one into fresh intellectual or aesthetic]{.mark} experience and
[understanding]{.mark} - creative process - [tends to be spoken of in
unambiguously positive terms]{.mark}, whether as a novelty-producing
activity, as a means of self-expression, or as a way of finding or
solving problems.]{.underline} It is true that the products of
creativity are often of personal or social value and they are made, if
not for the common good, at least not in order to cause pain or
distress; that is, we tend to consider creativity in general as the form
that Cropley et al distinguish from others (2008) as \"benevolent
creativity\". [[To think that creativity is inherently \"good\"]{.mark}
or as actually having to do with morality at all, [is an odd
belief]{.mark} or attitude to hold for two main reasons.]{.underline}
[The first is conveyed in Judaeo-Christian mythology with succinct
ambiguity]{.underline} (oxymoron intended), [where [the \"creator of
light]{.mark}\...the maker of peace\", [is also \"the author of
calamity\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Isaiah 45:7); he is partisan and
violent, insecure and jealously aware of competition afforded by the
other gods competing for worshippers at the time. The second reason to
see creativity as morally ambivalent is because [[creative process
consists of actions whose outcomes are the realisation of what has
previously only existed in imagination.]{.underline}]{.mark} [We know
that [we are capable of imagining horrors.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[Creative process takes us \"from the known to the
unknown\"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Pope, 2010, p. 11) [[and so the results
are necessarily unpredictable]{.mark} and unforeseeable.]{.underline}
When Ernest Rutherford\'s research led to the splitting of the atom in a
nuclear reaction in 1917, he was probably not thinking of how this new
knowledge might, with development over time, be used to annihilate
nations. We also know that what is seen as socially or culturally
beneficial depends on what is considered valuable by that society, that
culture, and what is desired by one may be precisely because it can harm
another. Thus, this article will look at some of the subjective concerns
that cause individuals and organisations to behave in ways that I will
refer to as \"malcreative\". Cases in point include the creative
\"vision\" of some of the key figures in the emergence of what has
become the neoliberal political hegemony, and the notion of \"creative
destruction\" in business and in war. [Discussion of [the darker aspects
of creative actions to emerge from beyond the boundary of
perception]{.mark}]{.underline} - which, borrowing from psychological
usage will be referred to as \"the limen\" - [[is seen to shape]{.mark}
not only personal lives, but [cultural and political landscapes on a
global scale.]{.mark}]{.underline} So, this article will refer to
several different versions of liminality from dreaming to virtual space,
and in all cases is seen as a creative source of either or both sublime
and grotesque phenomena, for it is the zone of conception wherein new
ideas and new forms are envisioned. Creativity Undefined Possibly a
definition would be useful at this point, but a pat sentence or two to
contain the concept of creativity is categorically impossible, given the
number of theories available, whether from Deleuze, from whose essay,
\"What is the creative act\", I have quoted extensively;
Csikszentmihalyi\'s (1997) systems model; Glaveanu (2017) who has
examined creativity as an integral aspect of culture, and culture as an
outcome of creativity; Keith Sawyer (2012), who mistakes it for a
\"science\", and derogates the notion that there is any mystery involved
in creative process; Jock Abra (1988, p. 410) who points out - in
disagreement with many other theorists - that creativity is actually
something extraordinary that is accessible only to a minority of people:
\"\[I\]n creative endeavor \... to hold that everyone potentially can
achieve may appeal to our senses of democracy and fair play but probably
reflects \'pseudo-egalitarian premises\"\'; or Stephen Diamond (1996)
who has written extensively on the psychology of creativity, including
both daimonic (inspirational) and demonic aspects. As he and others have
shown, it is possible to draw out certain strands from different
approaches that indicate the fierce potency of creativity. Dylan Thomas
(1934) speaks of the elemental \"force that drives the green fuse\",
that is, eros, or generative energy - which does not consider right or
wrong. Bourdieu\'s (1979, pp. 77-80) massive corpus on symbolic systems
shows how religious and linguistic systems and art can be \"instruments
for constructing reality\". That is, language, religion and art supply
the creative force behind the formation of the world we inhabit. [[World
building can be seen as]{.mark} perhaps [the ultimate form of
creativity, bu]{.mark}t again, [it may not]{.mark} necessarily [be
concerned with ethics]{.mark} or morality.]{.underline} I favour Raymond
Williams\' definition - or perhaps \"description\" is better, though I
do not know if he would have endorsed the applications to be suggested
in this article. \"Creative practice is . already, and actively, our
practical consciousness. When it becomes struggle . it can take many
forms. It can be \... a struggle at the roots of the mind .It can be
\... the articulation and formation of latent, momentary, and newly
possible consciousness\" (Williams, cited in Milligan, 2007, p. 73).
[This description conveys an idea of creativity as means towards change
whose starting place is the individual consciousness of one who is
probably dissatisfied with the dominant understandings of culture, of
politics, of his or her social or political or cultural
inheritance.]{.underline} Although Williams was speaking of creativity
in the context of changing political consciousness, the ideas could be
extended to other experiences of profound change, perhaps akin to
Thomas\' evocation of a potent force of generation and regeneration.
Indeed, Williams was making an argument for the ability of people to
actively engage in the re-making of the world. He was speaking for the
possibilities for conscious social action in a Marxist context, and this
quote speaks of creativity\'s dynamism. But [[dynamism is
valueneutral]{.mark} and can be as maleficient as it is
beneficient.]{.underline} I would like to consider a Romantic political
notion that originates in a kind of dark and dangerous aspirational
dream, then progress to the malcreativity that dreams can inspire,
concluding with reference to certain mechanisms of control propagated in
\"creative\" industries. Market Fundamentalism: A Romance Today [[we
inhabit a world dominated by]{.mark} this [economic ideology that
is]{.mark} often [misrepresented as]{.mark} being [democratic]{.mark},
or at least democracy-friendly, [concerned to improve the lot of all,
and pragmatic]{.mark} in nature, even as the gap between obscene wealth
and extreme poverty continues to grow]{.underline} (OECD iLibrary,
2015). As Block and Somers (2014, p. 150) remind us, it was the business
magnate George Soros who coined the term \"market fundamentalism\" in
1998, and although other terms - neoliberalism, economic rationalism,
laissez-faire capitalism, right-wing libertarianism - are used, Block
and Somers (and I) prefer it because it crisply conveys \"the
quasi-religious certainly expressed by contemporary advocates of market
self-regulation.\" [Market fundamentalist pundits continue to promote a
worldview that has become self-serving to the extent that the survival
of the planet itself has become a secondary matter to its central tenet:
the pursuit of economic growth and wealth creation, ostensibly of
nations but actually of a tiny elite.]{.underline} Ghassan Hage (2016)
likens the effect of this economic system to that of boiling lava;
McKenzie Wark (2014) has dubbed it \"thanaticism\" for its embrace of
the death-drive and its nod towards a mix of fanaticism and Thatcherism;
Naomi Klein (2007) has characterised its most extreme form as \"disaster
capitalism\" for its exploitation of anxiety and fear, and for its
engineering of calamities in order to reap ever greater profits. I am
not pretending to be a political scientist, but the image forming here
is of a death-driven (thanatic) and death-dealing force of volcanic
power capable of destroying the world. [This reality]{.underline}, I
would like to suggest, [has come about through a malign form of
creativity that might be characterised not as \"pragmatic\" but as
\"Romantic\"]{.underline} with a capital \"R\" - in the sense that
Hitler\'s national socialism was Romantic. Indeed, Raymond Williams
noted that the \"[ideas we call Romantic have to be understood in terms
of the problems of experience with which they were advanced to
deal\".]{.underline} While the Romantic poets were responding to what
they perceived as \"the tragedy of the period\" (Milligan, 2007, pp.
72-73) a few decades later Hitler was attempting to redress the
humiliations of his people after their failure in war through a call to
reinvigorate Romantic myths of Teutonic origins. [[Market
fundamentalism]{.mark} too [is an impassioned response to a]{.mark}
particular [perception of]{.mark} the [realities]{.mark} of the age,
[based on a mythic Romance of the radical Individualist]{.mark}
narrative which has found its form in a sort of grotesque version of the
American Dream]{.underline} (where individualism shifts from aspiring to
do one\'s best for the community to doing one\'s best for oneself
regardless of the community) and thence to the National Romanticism (or
Identity Nationalism) of Donald Trump, another Romantic dreamer \"full
of passionate intensity\" (Yeats, 1921-1928). Malcreative Dreaming
\"Beware of the dreams of others, because if you are caught in their
dream, you are done for,\" warns Deleuze. I would like to suggest that
[it is as if [many of us have become trapped in a dream]{.mark} dreamt
[by Ayn Rand,]{.mark} who lived \"with idiosyncratic ideas and concepts,
fantasies and nightmares, who out of \[her\] own personal experience in
society start\[ed\] to feel that dominant understandings no longer
work\"]{.underline} (Blommaert, 2005, p. 106). Rand was one of the
earliest proponents of an idiosyncratic notion of personal freedom that
found expression in a form of market fundamentalism based on her
Objectivist philosophy of absolute self-interest. [[All dreams are
liminal]{.mark} experiences - they straddle the waking and sleeping
realms and may contain the germs of realities yet to come - [but
this]{.mark} particular [dream demonstrates]{.mark}]{.underline} what
Nietzsche (in Reginster, 2007, p. 33) and later, Deleuze would have
referred to as [[a terrifying \"will to power\".]{.underline}]{.mark}
Unlike even Hayek, the defender of classical market liberalism, Rand
dismissed any consideration of \"the public good\", opining that \"there
is no such entity as \'the tribe\' or \'the public\'; the tribe (or the
public or society) is only a number of individual men\" (cited in
Sullivan 2017, p. 288). [The notion of communal welfare she saw as a
means of justifying tyrannies.]{.underline} What I\'m calling Rand\'s
\"romantic dream\" was reflected in the stance of her fictive hero
\"John Galt\" in Atlas Shrugged - the malcreative novel illustrating her
principles - who owes a great deal of his nature to Nietzsche\'s
Übermensch, that creator of new values who refused any limitations at
all, including those of race or class, politics or history. (Regardless
of the likelihood that Nietzsche would have appalled at such an
appropriation.) Although in the 1950s and \'60s Rand\'s then embryonic
project was largely disregarded or ridiculed and reviewers might have
decried Atlas Shrugged as \"execrable claptrap\" (Berliner, 2009), by
the 1980s and still enduring today is a zeitgeist that is entirely
sympathetic towards the message of Rand and the influential members of
her ironically titled \"Manhattan Collective\" - which included Alan
Greenspan presiding over the deregulation of the financial sector in the
U.S. - that greed, rather than being the greatest of the seven deadly
sins, is a virtue. The reason for this belief is that avarice, framed as
individualistic ambition, promotes economic growth, which must not be
allowed to slow for fear of stagnation. Growth is fuelled through
ceaseless productivity, or as Ayn Rand (1960) has her fictional hero,
John Galt proclaims: \"Productiveness is your acceptance of morality\...
your work is the purpose of your life, and you must speed past any
killer who assumes the right to stop you.\" While Rand can hardly be
taken as the sole creator of neoliberal values, her literary and
political work supplied inspiration to such men as Greenspan, and this
blueprint of creativity-toproductivity-to-ever-burgeoning-growth
continues to be uncritically accepted by many, no matter the personal,
community, or ecological sacrifices that are made in its name. [[It
might be said to be the formula that nurtured]{.underline}]{.mark}
Thatcher\'s daughter of the \'80s, [[TINA]{.mark} (There is No
Alternative (to global neoliberalism))]{.underline} given that that the
then British Prime Minister was clearly influenced by Rand\'s
philosophy, as evidenced by her plagiarism of Rand\'s claim in The
Virtue of Selfishness (and in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal) that as
society was merely an amalgam of individuals, \"society\" does not
exist. Rand\'s fervent dream seems to have captivated the imaginations
of other fantasists in high places and also middle and low places, or as
Biressi and Nunn (2014, p. 66) phrase it: \"By the 1980s this
industrious, self-interested individual would emerge to become the
archetypal political and popular hero of the Reagan and Thatcher years
and far beyond.\" Libertarianism, Millenarianism, and Notes on Liminal
Space as Malcreative Seedbed This section continues the discussion of
creativity as an amoral process by which changes in reality are made or
new realities are brought into existence by acts of the political
imagination. The resemblance between radical free-market economic
thinking and other forms of totalitarian thinking will be considered,
before moving on to discussion of originary sources of this mindset.
Market fundamentalism is totalitarian in its absolute adherence to the
belief that market imperatives should and must dictate all economic,
personal, and civic processes, regardless of human or environmental
cost, and its dream-realising aspirationalism shares certain
characteristics with utopianism. Indeed, according to Block and Somers
(2014, p. 150) \"market fundamentalism is the contemporary form of what
Polanyi \... identified six decades ago as economic liberalism\'s
\'stark Utopia\'\". The religion/utopian overtones were unmistakable
from its earliest days. According to the logic of Frank Knight, founder
of the Chicago School of Economics and teacher of Milton Friedman -
whose influence is still very much alive nearly ninety years later,
\'\"\[objectively\' defined, democracy means \[not representational
government through free and fair elections, but\] competitive
salesmanship in every field of activity, goods and services, political
programs and candidates, social attitudes or creeds, and plans for
salvation\" (1932, p. 453, Italics mine). [The free market is seen to be
fed by incontrovertible and unassailable natural forces governed by an
uncompromising Mammon, and the indwelling unconscious fears of
transgression and awe of the power of this particular deity are
enduringly potent. Such numinous thinking aligns with a vision of market
fundamentalism not as a system based on logic or sense, but very much on
faith.]{.underline} As a university teacher of economics, Knight
recommended that rather than encouraging honest speculation in research,
or \"groping towards truth\" amongst students, \"in the sense of .
problem-solving in the field of social phenomena\", which he
characterised as a \"costly waste\", universities should instead instill
in students a belief structure with \"slogans they inculcate as a sacred
feature of the system\" (1932, pp. 454-455, italics around millenarian
usages mine). In the late nineties, David Loy (1997) ventured the
opinion that the dominant economic system should be understood as a
religion, as it is its god The Market, to whom we turn for \"salvation\"
(p. 275). He adds that \"\[it is\] apparent that the Market is becoming
the first world religion\". Much more recently, Jonathon Bowden (2017
has referred to libertarianism\'s \"mystical elements \[\...and\...\]
unbridled forms of extremism\". Schumpeter\'s (1942, p. 82) notion of
[\"[creative destruction\" was appropriated by free-market
fundamentalists]{.mark} in order [to justify forms of that most creative
of actions - world-building - by]{.mark} energy [corporations]{.mark}
using militaristic methods in order [to \"invad\[e\] the world one
economy at a time\".]{.mark}]{.underline} (Juhasz, cited in Wright,
2007) Juhasz\' focus is on Iraq and \"what the press calls \'Bush\'s
Messianic Mission\' to bring democracy to Iraq, the rest of the world,
and Mars, and so on\" (Chomsky, 2008). [[Meanwhile]{.mark} - and
probably [not]{.mark} entirely [coincidentally]{.mark} - [Iraq]{.mark}
had also [attracted the attention of
megacorporations]{.mark}]{.underline} such as Chevron, Bechtel,
Halliburton and Lockheed Martin. However, [much earlier examples of
economic motivation purportedly provoking the hostile takeovers of
nations occurred in 1970s and \'80s in Central and South
America.]{.underline} Regime change in Chile is considered one of the
first now historical examples lending support to the (hardly original,
but apt) idea that, if terrorism is defined as unlawful use of violence
against noncombatants, jihadist terrorism is just the tip of the
iceberg. Indeed, according to Orlando Letelier, the U.S. ambassador to
Chile in the \'70s, [[the horrors that occurred in Chile]{.mark} at that
time [were enabled]{.mark} in part [by actions of the **anti-state
radicals**]{.mark} known as [the Chicago Boys]{.mark}, [utopian dreamers
of the Chicago School]{.mark} of economics, founded by Frank
Knight.]{.underline} When Richard Nixon, unnerved by the election of
Allende in 1970 and the prospect of a socialist government in Chile
directed the CIA to \"make the economy scream\", this action was seen by
Letelier as \"an equal partnership between the army and the economists\"
(cited in Klein, 2008, p. 71). And again, when Chile\'s military - with
over 75% of its funds coming from the CIA - began to work towards
overthrowing Allende, the economists worked towards annihilating his
ideas (Klein, 2008, p. 70), replacing them with their own dogma. Two
main characteristics emerge which seem to illustrate the creative verve
shared by globalised market fundamentalists and political extremists.
Firstly, in both cases [[desire-laden]{.mark} and radical [abstract
ideas]{.mark} or images [prevail over practical considerations]{.mark}
of running a country; [ethical considerations affecting thousands of
people dissolve]{.mark} in the face of this thanatic disdain for
life.]{.underline} Therefore, [it is perhaps not too long a bow to draw
to see this as a triumph of aspirational dreaming - or of nightmares
realised.]{.underline} Secondly, operating in the global free market the
neoliberal marketeer is, effectively, as free of national boundaries as
the jihadis whom Arthur Saniotis (2005, p. 533) characterised as liminal
beings because of the \"indeterminate and transnational nature of
jihadism\". He refers to the liminal model posited by Victor Turner
because of its emphasis on \"ambiguity, fragmentation and \'the blurring
of set boundaries\"\', and to the creative or transformative nature of
this condition in which new images are conceived, as well as their
extreme affect in and effects upon the world. So too, Saniotis\'
discussion of the \"lawless zone\" from which symbols are derived, and
the ways they lead to the creation of further images for a particular
utopian vision. He frames jihadists as \"liminal beings who seek to
reenchant the world via their symbolic and performative features\". [Yet
[free-market capitalists are]{.mark} as [prepared]{.mark} as jihadis [to
take radical steps towards the attainment of their vision]{.mark} of a
new paradigm [by enacting]{.mark} a program of [\"creative
destruction\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT Localism/Community Focus

#### The aff's emphasis on [local origin]{.underline} and [community based resolution]{.underline} plays into neoliberal tropes of local entrepreneurialism and affirms a [disempowering separation]{.underline} between violence "here" versus "out there" \-\-- the alternative's problematization is a [prerequisite]{.underline} to effective local action

The 'local' as problematic The emphasis on the local within democratic
and educational literature mirrors a similar emphasis arising in public
policy throughout North America and Europe. [[One]{.mark} of the [major
effect]{.mark}s [of neoliberal]{.mark} social [theory]{.mark} on the
policy environment [has been]{.mark} the '**[redefinition of spatial
inequality as a problem of local origin ]{.mark}**]{.underline}in need
of entrepreneurial resolution' (Amin,
2005,p.613).[[This]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[resulted
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the generation of policies that simultaneously
'download' public services onto local communities at the same time that
the state organizes [[a discourse of local responsibility for]{.mark}
the [generation and resolution of]{.mark} social
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pratchett, 2004).[In this context,
[individuals]{.mark} as well as communities]{.underline} (and nonprofit
and nongovernmental organizations) [[are expected to act in an
entrepreneurial manner, generating]{.mark} ongoing development of
[innovative solutions to social problems]{.mark} t]{.underline}hrough
public--private partnerships (Kelly, 2006).[[This]{.mark}]{.underline}
political economy has [[led to]{.mark} a policy [environment]{.mark} in
which [meeting]{.mark} the daily [needs of the dispossessed and
marginalized is increasingly difficult, privatized, unresponsive and
entrenches]{.mark} the [exploitation]{.mark} of those charged with
delivering these services]{.underline} (Colley, Henriksson, Niemeyer, &
Seddon, 2012).[In these contexts, [the need for individual citizens to
respond to social problems and]{.mark} to learn to
'[participate']{.mark} in their communities [has become]{.mark} a
[major]{.mark} agenda of governments]{.underline} across the world,
emphasized in campaigns and incentive structures emphasizing
volunteerism and participation in civil society (Hickey & Mohan, 2004;
Naples, 1998). Mark Purcell has argued, in a series of articles, that
the local has assumed a position within social theory that is
historically linked to the TINA environment in which [the
**[global]{.mark} terrain of [capitalism is seen as]{.mark} an
[uncontestable]{.mark}** space]{.underline} (Brown & Purcell, 2005;
Purcell, 2006).He refers to this process as 'the local trap'. [[The
local trap is]{.mark}: ...the [tendency of]{.mark} researchers and
[activists to assume something inherent about the local scale. The local
trap equates the local]{.mark} with 'the [good'; it is preferred
presumptively over non- local scales]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Purcell,
2006,p.1924) Purcell argues that in such discussions a few dynamics are
observable. Commonly, democratization and localization are conflated,
and 'local people' becomes equated with popular sovereignty.
Furthermore, [[community becomes **confined to its localized
manifestations**]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite the fact that geography
encapsulates a plurality of social relations, many of which transcend
spatial dimensions. These assumptions often crescendo into a conflation
of 'local' with 'participation'. Purcell observes that ['[local' comes
to signify particular populations]{.mark} who are [in need of
local]{.mark} participatory democratic [sovereignty]{.mark}, thus
**[reinscribing classist, racist, and colonialist articulations of
peoples and populations.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In Purcell's field of
development studies, he argues that 'local' becomes another way of
saying 'the poor', the 'indigenous', and so on. In this way, the local
can become a way around engaging directly with these constituting social
relations, despite the fact that [[it is on the local terrain
that]{.mark} such [trans-local social relations can be viewed in their
substantial expression]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ng & Mirchandani,
2008).Purcell traces the root of this emphasis on the local to the
participatory tradition within democratic theory, which argues that
participation at [[the local scale produces a more]{.underline}]{.mark}
participatory, more [[face-to-face,]{.underline}]{.mark} and thus more
democratic [[kind of association]{.underline}]{.mark} (McCowan,
2011;Schugurensky, 2007). [[Critiques of the local]{.underline}]{.mark}
from governmentality theorists [[suggest it as an expression of the
diffusion of the state in late capitalism and]{.mark} the [overall
neoliberal reorganization of political life]{.mark} (]{.underline}Dean,
1999;Jessop, 2007;Larner, 2000).[Political emphasis on the local is
**paradoxically related to the economic strategy of the local**, which
is embodied in policies that promote: ...new entrepreneurial approaches
to local economic development as well as diverse programs of
institutional restructuring intended to enhance labor market
flexibility, territorial competitiveness, and place-specific locational
assets]{.underline}. (Brenner & Theodore, 2002,p.341) The political
domains associated with this shift from Fordist-Keynesian state
arrangements are debated as a fundamental reorganization of the state or
simply a different expression of state power (Newman, 2010).Furthermore,
theorists continue to conflict as to whether this diffusion of state
power leaves opportunities for resistance or not. Evidence suggests that
the emphasis on local democracy may be primarily discursive (Blakeley,
2010;Blaug, 2002)and raisesthe further problem of the relation between
democratic processes and ensuring democratic outcomes (Pratchett, 2004).
John Holst (2002, 2007) has argued that critical educators are
struggling to generate an effective and dialectical articulation of the
relationship between the local and global, in spatial terms, or the
particular and universal in philosophical terms. This struggle is
evident in the many productive theoretical attempts to flesh out exactly
what we mean by notions such as 'globalization' and 'transnational'.
Flusty (2004) provides an exemplar of this sense of difference and
sameness, particularly and universality, in his attempt to define
globalization as: ...a combination of distinct spatial and temporal
practices that, in their execution and their accretion, exercise
globally formative effects ... it is globalization as both immanent in,
and increasingly intrinsic to, our everyday practices. (Flusty,
2004,p.4) [The conceptual difficulty of [globalization is]{.mark}
concentrated in our attempts to understand a policy environment
**[characterized by]{.mark} [economic crisis, austerity, precariousness,
secur- itization, wars on terror and drugs, and state
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The [[consequence of this
theoretical challenge is a mode of theorizing that
**reinforces**]{.mark} **a [separation between]{.mark} these [spatial
domains]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} that then leads to particular proposals
for educational programming, community mobilization, and social change,
which may tend toward over-determinism is either direction]{.underline}.
I propose that [[we should begin with]{.mark} an **[alternative
theorization]{.mark}, hopefully [fleshing out]{.mark} the [complicated
relationship between]{.mark} the [local as]{.mark} the [site of praxis
and]{.mark} the [local as]{.mark} the [site of
reproduction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For critical educators, [one of the
[dangers of our academic production may be]{.mark} an [unintentional
gravitation toward theorizations that reinforce]{.mark} the [ideological
forms]{.mark} and social relations that [we are charged with
dismantling]{.mark}]{.underline}. Paula Allman (2001, p. 167) named this
problem 'reproductive praxis', which, she argued, occurs when we
'partake in the relations and conditions we find already existing in the
world and assume these are natural and inevitable'. I would argue that
'[the local trap' is]{.underline} one such form of [reproductive
praxis]{.underline}, particularly reinforced through forms of democratic
learning [that construct the local as the preferred domain of
engagement. The 'local' as fetish]{.underline} While Purcell's argument
certainly pointed out theoretical tendencies in conceptualiza- tions of
the local, it did not adequately explain where this problem came from or
what larger ideological challenge is contained within it. This task,
according to Allman (2001), is a central task of critical educational
theory. I suggest that one way to think about this emphasis on the local
is through the concept of fetish. I propose this formulation because
even in its most nascent form, it leads educators down an original and
interesting path. The concept of fetish is of course subject to much
disagreement in radical and critical theory. Harvey (2010) argued that
Marx's elaboration of the concept of fetish began well before the famous
passage at the end of chapter one of the first volume of Capital, as
Marx (1867/1992) traced the ways in which the emphasis on the money
commodity in classical political economy conceals and confuses
particular contradictions within capitalism. In this sense, fetish is
articulated as a human labor, an act of consciousness, embodied in the
approach of bourgeois political economists. Marx argued that commodities
in exchange relations make visible the relationship of exchange and not
relations of production. In this sense, [[fetish 'attaches' itself to
the **commodity at the moment of exchange**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
However, Marx stressed, and Harvey echoed the importance of this
emphasis, that in this process, the relations of exchange 'appear as
what they are' (Marx,
1867/1992,p.165),meaningthatfetishismcontainsadualityofsorts,bothan
experiential reality, visible and accessible to the subject, and a
obscured reality, concealed from view through social processes and
relationships. [Commodity fetishism becomes represented in consciousness
when [we]{.mark} look at the price of a commodity and **[do not
recognize]{.mark} the [processes that create value and]{.mark} their
[relation to]{.mark} socially necessary [labor]{.mark}
time**]{.underline}. Furthermore, as Marx demonstrated in Capital, this
[concealment is a necessary outcome of the contradictions within the
social relations of production of capitalism]{.underline}. In this way,
[what is locally, experientially accessible comes to stand in as the
reality of something whose production is organized trans-locally. This
disjuncture between what is immediately and locally available and its
trans-local organization is the fissure that I want to explore through
the use of the concept of fetish. Often the concept of **fetishism is
interpreted in a paradoxically fetishized way, meaning that we believe
the commodity itself to be the source of this mode of consciousness
rather than the social relations and forms of consciousness that produce
the commodity**]{.underline}. Allman (2007)argued that fetishism within
Marx's conceptual universe is the ultimate form of reification, '[a form
of distortion where the attributes and powers, the essence, of the
person or social relation appear as natural, intrinsic, attributes of
powers of the "thing]{.underline}"' (p. 37). By utilizing the concept of
fetish, we can see that within the 'local trap', [the local becomes a
place represented through various domains of space, time, and identity;
it becomes objectified or 'fixed' in our thinking rather than remaining
as processes and relations that shift in time and space]{.underline}.
This [construction of the local not only sees the 'extra-local' as
inaccessible, it conceives of the local as inescapable. The local
somehow becomes apart from and opposite to the extra-local and the only
domain upon which social change may be pursued.]{.underline} Allman
(2001) argued that [this construction is intimately tied to the
organization of political and economic life under capitalism as separate
spheres. Certainly, we can tease out the relationships between this
'local' sphere of participation and its manifestation in the
conservative communitarian ideology that has characterized articulations
of the 'Third Way'. [By fetishizing the local we erase, diminish,
misinterpret, and/or confound its relation to the extra-local. The most
important point in which this relation is rendered invisible occurs when
we do not acknowledge]{.mark} that [local relations are not only
organized at the local level. The local is not just the local; it is
also]{.mark} the [global]{.mark}. It is the site where [global relations
become enacted in specific ways, organized through local social
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ng & Mirchandani, 2008). This relation,
however, has to be understood as a historical materialist dialectic in
order to transcend notions such as 'glocalization', which invents the
global--local dialectic as product of late capitalism and not, as Allman
argued, as part of the inner relations of capitalism (Allman, 2001;
Arnove, Torres, & Franz, 2013; Bauman, 1998). In this articulation, the
local is not solely determined by the global, read as 'the base', but
rather is 'fighting' for its sovereignty within the expanding global
market (Jarvis, 2006). Here the local and the global are conceptualized
as separate spheres acting upon one another. Like boxers in the ring,
they engage, but return to their separate corners. This connection of
the local--global/particular--universal relation obscures some very
important pieces of the puzzle, which are fundamental to the radical
theorization of democratic learning. Let me provide an example of the
problematic I am talking about, based on an organizing campaign in my
neighborhood about eight years ago. Wal-Mart announced its intentions to
open a store in our neighborhood. Several groups staged a protest
against the Wal-Mart. Then Wal-Mart began hiring people from the
neighborhood to renovate the abandoned K-Mart they had purchased and
argued they would bring both jobs to the neighborhood and products that
people in the neighborhood could afford, making a major economic
contribution to a rather disinvested space. The activists' major
complaint against Wal-Mart was that it destroys local 'communities',
understood primarily as immediate geographical surroundings (Fishman,
2006; Jia, 2008). Pulling their informa- tion from media, the Internet,
and organizations such as Wal-Mart Watch2, the coalition leveled all the
popular complaints against the corporation: it puts smaller retailers
out of business; it floods neighborhoods with poverty wage, nonunionized
jobs; it creates traffic problems, and undermines pedestrian-friendly
urban landscape design. While these allegations are the subject of some
debate as to their empirical accuracy, there is much truth to the
allegation that Wal-Mart is such a large corporation that it has been
able to position itself as beyond local control. However, the effects of
Wal-Mart are more insidious than the localized impacts of its retail
form. Wal-Mart imports commodities that are cheaply made and sells them
for cheap prices. They are made cheaply because they are produced in
'local places' where the hyper-exploitation of labor is pervasive and
violent. The size and scope of Wal-Mart allows it to have a tremendous
influence on the price of the bundle of commodities that contributes to
the determination of the value of labor-power as a commodity within the
USA. The value of the bundle of commodities necessary to reproduce
labor-power is a determining factor in the driving down of wages. As
wages fall, demand for cheap commodities increases. The result, wages
remain depressed. Harvey (2010) argued: \[T\]his also explains the
resistance, in many quarters of the capitalist class, to putting
barriers to entry or tariffs on Chinese goods, because to do so would be
to raise the cost of living in the US, leading to a demand from workers
for higher wages. (p. 105) Thus, Wal-Mart does indeed 'destroy local
communities' in every locality where it exists, in every locality where
it buys and produces its commodities, and through the social relations
of difference that it marshals to organize and exploit labor. It
globally destroys communities by mobilizing the dialectical relationship
between the local and the global in a particularly violent way.

###  AT Ontology

#### Ontologizing the historical prevents an accurate account of oppression -- pluralizing identities falls into the "freedom of individuality" that fails to move past dominant structures

**Wilkie '12** (Rob Wilkie, Assistant Professor of Cultural and Digital
Studies -- U Wisconsin-La Crosse, January 2012, "Capitalism\'s Posthuman
Empire," The Red Critique Vol. 14, Fall/Winter)\\\\AK

Despite their differences, what [each film relies on in re-writing the
contradictions of race and class as an epistemological confrontation
between human and animal is what Derrida theorizes as \"the gaze of the
absolute other\"]{.underline} (11); that is, the \"gaze of the animal\"
which \"offers to my sight the abyssal limit of the human: the inhuman
or the ahuman\" (12). For example, during his time on the farm Lurie
begins to work at the local rescue shelter/veterinary hospital and, as
part of his transition to an \"ethical\" posthumanist, helps to
euthanize the dogs and take them to the incinerator. Most significantly
in this context, since it ultimately reflects the \"realization\" that
Lurie undergoes over the course of the film, the attack on Lucy and him
occurs after he has just told a story about the \"ignobility\" of a male
dog that was beaten until he hated his own desire. As part of the attack
the young men shoot Lucy\'s dogs, which is meant to signal a sharp
contrast to Lurie\'s adopting of an \"ethical\" approach at the
veterinary clinic. What he ultimately comes to see is that recasting his
identity in the new post-Apartheid landscape will mean, in his words,
being \"humiliated... like a dog.\" This, however, is meant to indicate
not simply a personal humiliation, but, by the end of the film, an
inversion of his previous egoist \"self\" and, through identification
with animals' perspective, the full recognition of the epistemological
conditions which produce otherness. When, at the conclusion of the film,
Lurie leaves his car at the top of the mountain and walks down to
Lucy\'s farm for tea, giving up on his silent protest at the \"deal\"
that Lucy has made with Petrus to become her \"wife\" in exchange for
protection from future attacks, the viewer has been positioned to see
him as no longer able to act on his desires and thus having been reduced
to being \"a dog.\" In this way, we are meant to see the deep connection
that Lurie makes between humans and animals. He sees that to be other,
whether human or animal, means being \"humiliated\" by those in power.
Of course, the image of the white professor who is powerless in the face
of the black farmers completely inverts the reality of social relations
in South Africa, in which unemployment is listed as anywhere from 31% to
42%, falling largely on the black population (Zeiling and Ceruti). But
this, I argue, is the point. [Posthumanism is an ideology which
[separates culture from reality]{.mark} and, instead, [posits
that]{.mark} regardless of the economic, [social reality is always
driven by divisions which violently classify those]{.mark} whose desires
place them [outside the \"normal\" bounds of
society]{.mark}.]{.underline} In District 9 the relationship between
race and class is represented through the relay of science fiction. In
the film, we learn that the extraterrestrials literally emerge from
nowhere, as their ship suddenly appeared without warning in the sky over
Johannesburg. It is only when the humans cut into the ship and find the
aliens living in deplorable conditions with no seeming purpose that
\"first contact\" is made. While later in the film we learn that MNU is
one of the world\'s leading arms manufacturers and their interest in
managing the situation is obtaining the alien\'s weapon technology,
there is no reason given for the initial segregation of the aliens into
townships except their \"animal-like\" difference. In other words, like
the post-historical conclusion of Disgrace, District 9 turns the modern
history of exploitation and oppression into an ahistorical fear of the
other driven by the instrumental desire to \"capture\" all life in
reductive classifications. Similar to Lurie\'s taking up of the dog\'s
perspective, it is through Wikus\' adopting of the \"prawns\'\"
perspective that we learn that it is \"bad\" to \"capture\" or
\"impose\" upon life conditions which are alien to its existence---just
as Derrida and Agamben suggest---but---also like Agamben and
Derrida---not where these terms come from. Wikus\' decision at the
film\'s conclusion to sacrifice his own life to make sure that
Christopher Johnson and his son escape is thus meant to signify the
posthumanist realization that social change hinges on the individual
decision of how one approaches the other. [[There is no broad]{.mark}
social [movement]{.mark}, no social [collectivity, only the ethical acts
of one for the other]{.mark}, one in debt to the other. Thus, Wikus (and
the viewer) end the film [with the hope that the future will be
different]{.mark}, simply [through the act of individual
ethics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is the limit of the posthumanist
theory of \"difference.\" Insofar as [it defines otherness, oppression,
and exploitation as the effect of an instrumental logic of
classification which is endemic to all social relations, it denies that
there is any history to the ways in which people live]{.mark}. Instead,
transformative theory becomes an \"ethical\" praxis that, in the words
of Agamben, \"must face a problem and a particular situation each and
every time\" (What is An Apparatus? 9). In this way, [it becomes
impossible to suggest that exploitation and oppression are inherent to
capitalism]{.mark} or would be any different under any alternative mode
of production.]{.underline} In fact, Hardt and Negri argue precisely
this when they declare that \"Socialism and capitalism...are both
regimes of property that exclude the common\" (ix[). The consequence is
that [posthumanism effectively naturalizes capitalism]{.mark} by
[denying]{.mark}]{.underline} what Marx calls \"species-being\"---[[the
basis of]{.mark} human [freedom in]{.mark} the [collectivity]{.mark} of
labor]{.underline}---and replacing it instead with what Agamben calls
\"special being\" or that which \"without resembling any
other...represents all others\" (Profanations 59). When Agamben
proclaims that, \"'To be special \[far specie\] can mean 'to surprise
and astonish' (in a negative sense) by not fitting into established
rules, but the notion that individuals constitute a species and belong
together in a homogeneous class tends to be reassuring\" (59) he
[replicates the bourgeois theory of difference which, as Marx writes, is
based upon \"[an individual separated from the community, withdrawn into
himself, wholly preoccupied with his private interest]{.mark} and acting
in accordance with his private caprice\" such that \"far from being
considered, in the rights of man, as a species-being; on the contrary,
species-life itself---[society---appears as a system which is external
to the individual]{.mark} and as [a limitation of]{.mark} his original
[independence]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (On the Jewish Question 43). In
other words, [[the]{.mark} very [nature of the division of labor under
capitalism causes workers to blame ahistorical notions of \"society\"
and \"government\"]{.mark} for the contradictions which reside in the
economic and, in turn, [seek refuge in the \"freedom\" of
individuality]{.mark} which bourgeois society promises.]{.underline} In
this way, when Agamben writes that \"The transformation of the species
into a principle of identity and classification is the original sin of
our culture, its most implacable apparatus \[dispositivo\]\" (60), he
reproduces the sense with which people respond to capitalist
exploitation by blaming the very idea of \"society,\" rather than the
society of exploitation. [By taking the question of [identity and
difference]{.mark} out of the social, Agamben turns exploitation into an
existential crisis which can only be resolved by the ethical recognition
of difference on its own terms, leaving the contradictions of society
intact. This is how the posthumanist theories of identity [return to the
same structures of representation they claim to oppose because their
opposition does not move beyond the economic structures of
capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline} Both the Hegelian theory of
\"recognition\" and the posthuman theory of \"singularity\" are
ultimately theories of the isolated individual, which is an ideological
fiction arising alongside capitalism (a la \"Robinson Crusoe\") as a
result of the economic shift toward wage-labor. [[They]{.mark}
consequently [substitute for more radical theories]{.mark} of freedom
from the market the freedom of the individual in the market, as if rigid
structures of social interpretations and not the system of wage-labor
were holding the individual back[. If we are to]{.mark} truly [see the
world differently]{.mark}, not just as isolated individuals, but as [a
united community which uses new technologies]{.mark} for freeing people
from the drudgery of wage labor and its corresponding ideologies of
racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression, what [is
necessary]{.mark} is a social transformation that ends the exploitation
of labor upon which capitalism is based. [Pluralizing identities doesn't
challenge the logic of exploitation, but actually expands it since
private property establishes individual responsibility]{.mark} as the
very basis of one\'s \"natural\" existence by stripping people of any
means of survival outside of wage-labor. Thus, [retreating into
individualism is]{.mark} merely [the]{.mark} ideological [mask]{.mark}
which is [placed over]{.mark} the subsumption of all [life under the
profit motive]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, as Marx writes, regardless
of appearances, \"the individual is the social being. His life, even if
it may not appear in the direct form of a communal life carried out
together with others is... an expression and confirmation of social
life\" (86). Although posthumanism turns the alienation of the worker
under capitalism into the very pre-condition of all culture, I argue
that it is only by freeing labor from the restrictions of capitalist
exploitation that, we can, as Marx writes, end racial oppression and
find a \"genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and
between man and man---[the true resolution of the strife between
existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation,
between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the
species\"]{.underline} (84).

### AT Performance

#### Performance fails -- it traps resistance at the individual level and cedes the power of surveillance to recognition -- this locks in a universalized, neoliberal subject at the center of their movements -- only anti-capitalist organizing solves

**Monahan 15**\
(Torin Monahan is associate professor in the Department of Human and
Organizational Development at Vanderbilt University. "The Right to Hide?
Anti-Surveillance Camouflage and the Aestheticization of Resistance"
Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies Vol. 12, No. 2, June 2015
<http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/Right-to-hide.pdf> rvs)

[[The aestheticization of resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} enacted by
anti-surveillance camouflage and fashion [ultimately [fails to
address]{.mark} the exclusionary logics of contemporary state and
[corporate surveillance.]{.mark}]{.underline} These anti-surveillance
practices emerge at this historical juncture because of a widespread
recognition of unchecked, pervasive surveillance and popular criticism
of government and corporate overreach. [The key to the popularity of
[these artistic efforts]{.mark} may be that they [mobilize the trappings
of radical intervention]{.mark}, in highly stylized form, [but do so in
ways that do not compel people to challenge state visuality
projects.]{.mark} [They offer hyper-individualized and consumer-oriented
adaptations to]{.mark} undesired [surveillance.]{.mark}]{.underline} [To
the extent that such efforts can be seen as critical interventions, they
rely on an appeal to the pedagogical potential of art to galvanize
meaningful political change.]{.underline} As Jacques Rancière explains:
Art is presumed to be effective politically because it displays the
marks of domination, or parodies mainstream icons, or even because it
leaves the spaces reserved for it and becomes a social practice. . . .
The logic of mimesis consists in conferring on the artwork the power of
the effects that it is supposed to elicit on the behavior of
spectators.65 In the case of the examples covered in this paper, it is
clear that [while some of the signifiers of critical art are
present]{.underline}, for instance with the Fag Face Mask's blurring of
institutionally imposed identities, [[the primary message is]{.mark}
nonetheless [one of accommodating]{.mark} pervasive
[surveillance]{.mark} and inviting a playful dance with it.]{.underline}
[[Recognition of the violent]{.mark}, unequal, and marginalizing
[applications of surveillance is bracketed]{.mark} or denied [in the
presentation of universal, neoliberal subjects in search of]{.mark} a
modicum of]{.underline} (fashionable) [[control over their
exposure.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is not to say that play has no place
in resistance efforts. As Jeffrey Juris66 has illustrated in his
ethnography of the anti-corporate globalization movement, play and
frivolity can sometimes succeed in ways that oppositional tactics
cannot. For example, in spaces of confrontation, people playing music or
staging performances while dressed in elaborate costumes are effective
because they are symbolically powerful solidarity-building activities
that are not physically threatening to the police. Juris writes, "Such
playful provocation represents a form of ritual opposition, a symbolic
overturning of hierarchy much like medieval carnival.... Play, in
particular, reveals the possibility of radically reorganizing current
social arrangements." 67 In the mode of anti-surveillance, groups like
the Surveillance Camera Players similarly embody a spirit of play as
they stage performances for video surveillance camera operators and
spectators in public places like New York City subway stations.68
Perhaps because of the public setting of these performances, which
usually end with police or security guards escorting players off public
property, these interventions may have the effect of fostering in
audiences a critique of policing priorities and the commodification of
public space. Play of this sort may be an effective form of resistance
that alters public awareness and cultural sensibilities, but it can be a
difficult task for such interventions to problematize inequalities that
can fester within assumptions of shared rights. Ultimately, [discourses
of "the right to hide" are weak variations of "the right to privacy,"
both of which depend on conceptually inadequate and empirically
deficient mobilizations of universal rights.]{.underline} Indeed, [poor
and racialized populations subjected to the most invasive forms of
monitoring are much more concerned with issues of domination and
control, along with the practicalities of survival, than they are with
legal or philosophical abstractions like privacy.]{.underline}69
[Privacy is also a deeply individualistic concept, poorly suited to
forestall discriminatory practices against social groups.]{.underline}70
As Sami Coll explains, "The notion of privacy, as a critique of \[the\]
information society, has been assimilated and reshaped by and in favour
of informational capitalism, notably by being over-individualized
through the self-determination principle." 71 [The discourse of [the
right to hide]{.mark}, as with the right to privacy, [accepts]{.mark}
the legitimacy of [state demands for legible populations and offers
symbolic compromises to assert degrees of freedom within those
constraints.]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead of being content with artistic
forms of hiding, [[countervisuality projects]{.mark}, by contrast,
[would]{.mark} "look back" and [pursue alternatives to]{.mark}
totalizing regimes of [state visuality]{.mark}.]{.underline} [They would
seek to undermine the authority of state control [by challenging the
capitalist imperatives that lend legitimacy to]{.mark} forms of [state
violence]{.mark} and oppression.]{.underline}72 [**[What is required is
a full engagement with "the political,"]{.mark}** which,]{.underline} as
Rancière describes, [is always **[in opposition to the
police]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The police is not a social function but a
symbolic constitution of the social. The essence of the police lies
neither in repression nor even in control over the living. Its essence
lies in a certain way of dividing up the sensible. . . . [Politics, by
contrast, consists in transforming this space of "move-along," of
circulation, into a space for the appearance of a subject: the people,
the workers, the citizens.]{.underline}73

#### **Negative state action like protest maintains the state by ensuring the states engagement with the people** 

**Lynch 16** (The Forum, Beyond protest, Dr Tommy Lynch is Senior

as it applies to thinking about religion and politics. He has written on
Hegel, Kierkegaard, psychoanalysis and liberation theology.) **Wolfy

Protest plays a key role in politics. Groups protest in order to change
the social order, whether the goal is legal recognition of rights or
political and economic reform. [What does protest accomplish
though]{.underline}? On the one hand, the last century has seen dramatic
changes in the legal rights of women, racial minorities, and LGBTQ
people. On the other hand, those [advancements leave certain norms in
place: the nuclear family, racial and gender hierarchies, and
capitalism. These norms are the often implicit and unconscious rules,
habits, and ideas that structure our experience of the
world.]{.underline} They tell us what we should do. The work of Jacques
Lacan can help us think about the relationship between these norms,
protest, and the dynamics of change. Lacan was a 20th century French
psychoanalyst. He saw his psychoanalytic method as a return to Freud,
whose insights Lacan thought were being diluted and diminished in the
psychoanalytic theories of his contemporaries. Though he presented his
work as a return to Freud, it was a return through linguistics,
anthropology, and philosophy. The result is a dynamic, complex vision of
the nature of subjectivity---the way that we conceive of our identity in
relation to the self, others, and society as a whole. While he published
relatively little, from the 1950s onward he held a series of seminars in
Paris. Transcripts of some of those seminars have been compiled and
published (a number have also been translated into English). These
seminars discuss Lacan's approach to Freudian psychoanalysis and a whole
range of issues including religion, politics, and philosophy. They are
notoriously dense, jumping from one idea to another, often leaving the
contemporary reader at a loss. Noam Chomsky even goes so far as to
characterize Lacan as a charlatan. Despite these critiques, his work
continues to be influential, playing a formative role in two of
contemporary 'continental' philosophy's most prominent voices---Slavoj
Žižek and Alain Badiou. It is no coincidence that both Žižek and Badiou
are interested in the relationship between subjectivity and political
change. While Lacan does not offer a political perspective per se, his
view of subjectivity, and the relation between subjects and their social
and linguistic contexts, has clear political implications. One point
where these implications become clear is in his 17th seminar. Here,
Lacan describes the Four Discourses. In order to discuss the Four
Discourses, it is necessary to first understand some of the basics of
Lacan's theory of the subject. At the heart of Lacan's project is what
he called the split subject. We tend to think of ourselves as whole or
complete. From birth onward, we are presented with the fantasy of a
stable identity---I think I am me. [Lacan argues, counterintuitively,
that I am never me. I am not what I see in the mirror nor the 'I' that I
invoke when I speak about myself. Rather, I am the tension created by
the fantasy that I am me. I am my misrecognition of myself. The point of
his understanding of psychoanalysis is not to find one's true self or to
become a well-adjusted member of society, it is to discover what it
means to embrace that tension and surrender the illusion that it will
ever be resolved.]{.underline} Surrendering that illusion is difficult
work, though. Our development from early childhood onward is predicated
on the promise of eventually achieving wholeness (in a partner, work,
etc.). For Lacan, this is the true lesson of Freud's work on the Oedipus
complex. We desire the sense of completeness that is associated with the
child's relation to the mother. This completeness, however, is a
fantasy. We desire the recovery of a sense of wholeness that never was.

### AT Race

#### Racism is used to justify inequality and divide the working class --- under a Trump presidency, the only option left is a collective Marxist struggle against capitalism---it's empirically effective but individualized identity-based strategies make it impossible

**Monzó, PhD., 17**---Assistant Professor of Education in the College of
Educational Studies at Chapman University, Ph.D. in Education from the
University of Southern California (Lilia, 2/1/17, "Marx in the Age of
Trump: Reaching Out to Communities of Color,"
<https://www.internationalmarxisthumanist.org/articles/marx-age-trump-reaching-communities-color-lilia-d-monzo>)
\\\\AK

Now that Donald Trump has become President after winning by running a
campaign of hate and lies -- against women, Mexican and Central American
immigrants, First Peoples, Black Americans, Muslims and LGBTQ [-- [it is
imperative]{.mark} that [we stand]{.mark} together [in solidarity and
strategize collectively]{.mark} on ways to resist the assaults that have
already begun to materialize]{.underline} -- executive orders that ban
travel from majority Muslim countries, a halt on refugee programs,
increased deportations of undocumented workers, the targeting of
sanctuary cities and increased tolerance for racism and misogyny. [No
one has provided us with a greater theoretical lens and practical
approach for challenging capitalist relations than Karl
Marx]{.underline} -- that brilliant philosopher whose vision for a new
humanism has inspired numerous people's uprisings and revolutions around
the world but who has also been villainized like no other by those who
seek to secure the capitalist way of life. Indeed these robber barons
who make up the capitalist class have found what would seem an unlikely
ally in segments of White working class America, whose nostalgia for a
time in which the Other could be ignored and discounted makes them
believe we can "make America great again." However, Marx foresaw long
ago in his studies of the U.S. Civil War and of the Fenians of Ireland
that racism was a powerful tool against working class unity and that
poor Whites would instead tend to side with their racialized group than
with a non-dominant group, even though this meant they were aiding in
their own oppression. Marx explains in a letter dated April of 1870:
["[Every]{.mark} industrial and commercial [center]{.mark} in England
now [possesses a working class divided into two camps, English
proletarians and Irish proletarians. The English]{.mark} worker [hates
the Irish]{.mark} worker [as a competitor]{.mark} who lowers his
standard of life ...]{.underline} He regards himself as a member of the
ruling nation, and consequently[, [he becomes a tool of the]{.mark}
English aristocrats and [capitalists against Ireland]{.mark}, thus
[strengthening their domination]{.mark} over himself. [He
cherishes]{.mark} religious, social, and national [prejudices]{.mark}
against the Irish worker.]{.underline} His attitude towards him is much
the same as that of the "poor whites" to the Negroes in the former slave
states of the U.S.A." ["[This antagonism is artificially]{.mark} kept
alive and [intensified]{.mark} by the press, the pulpit, the comic
papers, in short by all the means [at the disposal of the ruling
classes]{.mark}. This antagonism is [the secret of the impotence of
the]{.mark} English [working class, despite its organization]{.mark}. It
is the secret [by which the capitalist class maintains its
power]{.mark}.]{.underline} And the latter is quite aware of this."
Here, [Marx highlights the three important functions of racism beyond
slavery -- 1) to [create an ideological ferment against people of
color]{.mark} that serves [to justify inequality]{.mark}, 2) [to
minimize the value of a segment of the working class]{.mark} and drive
down the wages of all workers, and 3) [to divide the working class
an]{.mark}d thereby [stunt]{.mark} the working class [consciousness and
unity necessary]{.mark} to bring down capitalism.]{.underline} While it
is true that, considering his vast body of work, Marx did not write a
lot about racism and when he did so it was almost always in connection
to its economic function and the class struggle, he was staunchly
against American slavery, writing that "Labor cannot emancipate itself
in the white skin where in the Black it is branded" (Marx, 1977/1867).
[This is because Marx's historical materialism posits that consciousness
stems from material conditions. That is, although [racism is]{.mark}
ideological, racist attitudes and beliefs are [rooted in the conditions
of inequality]{.mark} that exist and these racist [ideologies]{.mark}
justify and [further entrench these conditions]{.mark} of economic and
social inequality. While the [class struggle alone cannot
liberate]{.mark} people of color, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor (2011)
reminds: "Marxism should not be conceived of as an unchanging dogma. [It
is a guide to]{.mark} social [revolution and political action]{.mark},
and has been built upon by successive generations of
Marxists."]{.underline} Unfortunately, Marx's clear anti-racist message
has been obscured among many intellectuals, especially those of color,
who have been understandably turned off by the Eurocentric views he
expressed in his earliest works regarding non-Western peoples, including
in the Communist Manifesto of 1848 and in many of his articles published
in The New York Daily Tribune, for which he worked as the European
correspondent from 1853-1862 (Anderson, 2010). However, and this is
crucial, Marx's Eurocentric views must be understood as having developed
within a particular historical context in which little was known about
the non-Western world within the West, especially among those who had
little contact with non-Western peoples. Indeed even today within a
globally multicultural world, the subconscious and even overt belief
that the White raced peoples are superior, more intelligent, and more
moral is at the heart of the nationalism and scape-goating of immigrants
that so deeply plagues our country. Kevin Anderson (2010) in Marx at the
Margins has gifted the world with a remarkably detailed and insightful
account of Marx's development in regards non-western peoples -- from his
early Eurocentric views to his eventual shift wherein he not only
recognized and valued the communal villages he had once called despotic
but also came to believe prophetically that Russia had the potential to
develop communism before the capitalist world. Anderson documents that
Marx recognized his lack of understanding and sought to remedy this
situation. In a letter to Engels, written in 1852, Marx admitted his
lack of knowledge about the Orient. Thereafter Marx set out to learn
about the peoples who the English Imperialists ravaged with Imperial
"barbarism," including peoples from India, China, and Ireland. These
studies led him to discover the Asiatic mode of production from which he
deduced the possibility of multiple paths to communism and which also
led him to recognize that Capital was a critique of capitalism and its
development in Western Europe rather than a universal model for
"civilization" (Marx, 1993). By examining his writings over time,
Anderson (2010) paints a portrait of a man whose studies and the
realities of current politics at the time led him to a more dialectical
reasoning and more able to recognize non-Western peoples as
revolutionary subjects capable of developing their own path toward
communism, without needing to follow the Western model. Marx's
philosophy of revolution has played an important role in liberation
struggles across the world, For example[, Marx and early
[Marxists]{.mark} and later the pre-World War II Communist Party in the
U.S. [were instrumental to]{.mark} the [abolition]{.mark} of slavery,
[to]{.mark} the [suffrage]{.mark} movements, and later [to Black
Liberation]{.mark} movements, including [the]{.mark} [B]{.mark}lack
[P]{.mark}anther [P]{.mark}arty, and [to]{.mark} the [Civil
Right]{.mark}s movement of the 1960s.]{.underline} Unfortunately, this
relationship between Marxism and anti-racist struggle is little known.
Certainly Marx's work or other [critiques of capitalism are not part of
the curriculum of US K-12 schooling and increasingly he is dismissed as
passé in colleges and universities. The Cold War years and the Soviet
Union's turn to Stalinism]{.underline} (which Raya Dunayevskaya has
called a form of state-capitalism) [were detrimental to the struggle
against capital, as the United States and its allies developed full
blown campaigns to villainize communism and Marx, and to align
capitalism with democracy and freedom, even though these are
antithetical to the defining characteristic of inequality and unfreedoms
in capitalism]{.underline} (Dean, 2012). [After the fall of the Soviet
Union it became commonly accepted that capitalism was the only system
that "works" and Marx and Marxism became relegated to the past, believed
to be incapable of speaking to present conditions.]{.underline} This
narrative has become part of the American unconscious -- unquestioned
even in the face of significant evidence to the contrary -- for [its
hard to imagine that a system that "works" could be one that creates
such inequalities, poverty, endless wars, hatred, cruelty, and human
suffering.]{.underline} Yet as Gramsci (1971) noted, the ruling class
determines common sense and thus the Cold War during the 70s led to the
steady redressing of the gains of the 60s, as seen in de-facto
segregation[. A [prison industrial complex]{.mark} systematically
[criminalized]{.mark} and incarcerated economically [impoverished
communities]{.mark} of color [and]{.mark} effectively [set up]{.mark}
urban or [racialized schools as subsidiaries to]{.mark} the [juvenile
justice]{.mark} system. We also saw attacks on immigrant populations,
bilingual education, ethnic studies programs, affirmative action, and
huge cut backs to social services for the poor]{.underline} (Darder,
2012). [This also presumably justified the U.S. self-proclamation as the
world's benevolent savior of "democracy," all the while squashing any
popular movements across the world that even hinted at socialist ideals.
Not long after, in the 80s, the postmodern era brought forth the
cultural turn and an [identity politics]{.mark} that has taken our
attention from explaining oppression as a historical materialist
phenomena to an ideational one in which people are oppressed as a result
of prejudice and discrimination related to cultural differences. In this
postmodern approach, [a multiplicity of]{.mark} singular [individual
identities obliterates any potential for group consciousness. Class
struggle is made impossible]{.mark} (Monzó & McLaren, 2015). This new
era of identity politics has led to [the critique]{.mark} that Marx and
Marxism "reduced everything to class" and make racism, sexism and other
antagonisms a secondary consideration -- [something that will either
automatically resolve itself under socialism or that will be dealt with
after class relations are abolished]{.mark}.]{.underline} Of course this
is a total misunderstanding of Marx's humanism and dialectical method,
which stands against all forms of oppression and calls for a humanity
founded on equality, freedom, and the recognition of our interdependence
as a species beings. From a Marxist perspective, [[class is]{.mark} not
more important than other antagonisms but it does serve as [the
explanatory heuristic.]{.mark} While the oppression of women certainly
came before capitalism, sexism takes on particular specificity within
capitalist relations that serve to aid and maintain capitalist
production (Monzó & McLaren, 2015). Although many Marxists of late have
attempted to rectify this misinterpretation of Marx, stating
unequivocally the centrality of racism and sexism in class struggle
(Anderson, 2010; Cole, 1991; Dunayevskaya, 1985; Hudis, 2013; McLaren,
2015; Monzó, 2017), many women and people of color are looking to
develop their own theories, arguing that it is high time that our
ontological and epistemological ways are developed toward our own
struggles]{.underline}. As a woman of color I concur that it is time for
us to move outside the shadows of Western imperialism, recover our
stolen knowledges, and develop theories that reflect our social
conditions. However, I would argue that it would be not only unwise but
also detrimental to reject a philosophy of liberation that can change
the world for the better and that within Marxism there is still much
that we can contribute to creating a path to communism and beyond. For
Marx[, [communism was not an endpoint]{.mark} of development
[but]{.mark} only [a point along a never-ending process of
becoming]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[In this contribution, I wish to argue that the recent enthusiasm for
the concept of resilience across a range of policy literature is the
consequence of its fit with neoliberal discourse. This is not to say
that the idea of resilience is reducible to neoliberal policy and
governance, but it does fit neatly with what it is trying to say and
do]{.underline}. [A brief glance at the concept\'s origins shows it to
have certain ontological commitments that make it ideally suited to
neoliberal forms of governance]{.underline}. Having briefly examined
these philosophical aspects, I move on to define this relationship to
governance through the concept of governmentality. This also requires a
particular understanding of the dominant forms of governmentality as
specifically neoliberal in nature. I then defend this interpretation of
both resilience and governmentality against the claim that resilience is
part of an emerging post-liberalism. [Instead, I argue that we are
witnessing two connected but distinguishable processes -- the
rolling-back of classical liberalism and the rolling-out or embedding of
neoliberalism.]{.underline} To give a slightly optimistic tone to the
argument, I suggest that this is a contested process and that the
perceived end of classical liberalism is as much an effect of the
neoliberal discourse as it is an actuality. [The concept of resilience
has entered the political vocabulary from literature on the adaptability
of ecological systems]{.underline}. Unlike engineering resilience which
emphasises how things return to a stable steady state, ecological
resilience is far from stable. Instabilities may change the system
leading to significant
restructuring.[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21693293.2013.765741) 1

Jonathan Joseph, The Social in the Global: Social Theory,
Governmentality and Global Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 2012).View all notes I have argued that most contemporary social
theories contribute to an ontology that renders the world governable in
certain ways. These ontological commitments are certainly not reducible
to the political practices and indeed can be found across a range of
disciplines including ecology, geography and various intersections of
social and natural science. Whether these philosophies go under the
descriptions of 'new materialism', 'complexity theory', 'network
analysis' or 'reflexive approaches', they share a set of ontological
commitments. [The idea of resilience fits neatly with these 'new'
ontological commitments. It assumes a world that is increasingly complex
but also contingent. Stable and enduring social relations are believed
to have given way to complex networks of actors, each with their own
individual pursuits. Our social engagements have no necessity to them;
they are what we make of them and blend with our own particular
narratives. And in order to survive the uncertainties of complex
systems, people have to show their own initiative as active and
reflexive agents capable of adaptive behaviour. Although these
philosophies are not reducible to political practices, it is easy to see
how they might lend themselves to particular ways of
governing]{.underline}. Rather than challenging a series of mistaken
philosophical commitments, the rest of this paper will concentrate on
the political consequences of such ideas. [In particular, on how these
approaches conceptualise the social order in such a way that is
consistent with neoliberal practices of governance.]{.underline} A
belief in the contingency and complexity of adaptive systems supports
the sociological view that society is moving away from enduring social
relations based on such things as class, nation-state and social
identity in favour of a view of the world as comprising individualised
consumer-citizens with their own life-pursuits. [Resilience fits with a
social ontology that urges us to turn from a concern with the outside
world to a concern with our own subjectivity, our adaptability, our
reflexive understanding, our own risk assessments, our knowledge
acquisition and, above all else, our responsible decision-making.
Although we started with ontological assumptions about the bigger social
world, we arrive at a view by which the best way to govern society is
through a greater awareness of our own behaviour. Indeed, a major claim
here is that the way resilience works, certainly in Anglo-Saxon
approaches, is to move fairly swiftly from thinking about the dynamics
of systems to emphasising individual responsibility, adaptability and
preparedness]{.underline}. For the reasons above, I study the concept of
resilience through the lens of governance in order to see how and why it
has entered the political vocabulary. More than this, it is through a
Foucauldian understanding of governing that we learn most about what the
concept of resilience is actually doing. For example,

through its own claims about the changing nature of security threats,
but instead as an indication of the changing organisational structure of
the advanced liberal societies. [O\'Malley, meanwhile, notes that
resilience is not just a reactive model that teaches people how to
'bounce back', but also acts as a means to create adaptable subjects
capable of adapting to and exploiting situations of radical
uncertainty.]{.underline}[12](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21693293.2013.765741)12

notes In the 'Resilience as governmentality' section, [I argue that this
fits with a neoliberal mode of governmentality present, to varying
degrees, in the advanced liberal societies. Resilience supports the
organisational structure of the advanced liberal societies through its
assumptions about social relations, and it supports the idea of the
neoliberal subject as autonomous and responsible. It helps embed that
subject, particularly in relation to processes of
governance.]{.underline}

[Having outlined why I think resilience fits with neoliberal discourse
and practice, I want to address the argument made by David Chandler that
resilience is in fact part of a new phase of
post-liberalism]{.underline}. Although I think Chandler is right to
point out the shift from a classical liberal rights approach to
intervention and state-building, he is wrong to characterise this as
post-liberal. Chandler\'s argument is a powerful one and contains
important insights regarding a paradigm shift away from classical
liberal framings of politics and the subject. However, I wish to dispute
his argument that this constitutes a post-liberal phase. My claim is
that this shift is adequately described as neoliberalism is and that to
call it something else is to unintentionally reinforce neoliberal
ideology by not calling things as they are. [In discussing international
interventions associated with projects of state-building, Chandler
suggests that resilience is playing a pivotal role in the shift away
from classical liberal interventionist discourses and towards greater
emphasis on preventive intervention]{.underline}. This means a focus on
'the empowerment and responsibility of agency at the local societal
level, rather than upon the assertion of the right of external sovereign
agency'.[23](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21693293.2013.765741)23

[This shift in responsibility can be seen as typical of governmentality
insofar as it operates from a distance, lowering expectations of what
Western governments are prepared to do, while at the same time promoting
the need for capacity building to enhance practices of good
governance]{.underline}. [What counts as good governance is decided by
Western interests and transmitted through a normative and normalising
discourse that transfers responsibility to local agents]{.underline}. To
summarise Chandler\'s views: [it is the discursive framing of the
'broader' human security discourse, with its emphasis upon prevention,
resilience and empowerment, that facilitates dominant discourses of
international regulation and intervention today, up to and including
coercive military actions, rather than liberal internationalist claims
of interventionist rights to undermine sovereignty in the cause of
global human rights
victims]{.underline}.[24](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21693293.2013.765741)24
Ibid., 223.View all notes [Such approaches are described as being agent
centred and move away from direct intervention or provision of resources
in favour of 'empowering' local subjects.]{.underline} [The problem is
deemed to be their lack of proper institutional and social resources, to
be addressed through practices of good governance and capacity
building]{.underline}. I believe that all this can be explained through
the idea of neoliberal governmentality. However, Chandler, while
appreciative of the contribution that concepts such as governmentality
can make, has a bigger point to argue. In Chandler\'s view this is not
just a transformation of liberalism, but a rejection of it. He makes
this point by claiming that the new discourse and practices are an
inversion of classical liberalism. It rejects liberal modernity\'s frame
of the social contract and the securing role of the sovereign agent.
Modern rights-based assumptions of government and law are transformed.
For classical liberal framings, government and the market are
constructed upon the autonomy of the subject, conceived of as a rational
self-determining
actor.[25](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21693293.2013.765741)25

Ibid., 20.View all notes There are two issues to unpick here. One is the
perceived decline of the classical liberal discourse of rights. The
other is the issue of the autonomy of the individual. These two elements
are addressed in a comment from Foucault. He argues that liberalism\'s
account of freedom contains two contradictory elements. On the one hand,
there is a juridical conception of freedom which is possessed by every
individual. On the other, freedom is conceived not as the exercise of
some basic rights, but as the autonomy or independence of the governed.
These are two heterogeneous conceptions of freedom, one based on human
rights, the other on the independence of the governed, and they have
different histories and
origins.[28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21693293.2013.765741)28
Foucault, Birth of Biopolitics, 42.View all notesChandler\'s
post-liberal argument can be said to point to this essential
contradiction within liberal conceptions of freedom. But there are
problems both with his account of the decline of rights-based liberalism
and with his account of the problem of individual autonomy. First,
although Chandler is right to point to the shift away from a classical
rights-based liberalism, this is a shift rather than a full reversal and
does not necessarily mean the end of classical liberalism. Ironically,
he falls into the poststructuralist\'s trap of hunting for binary
oppositions rather than looking at reality. Moreover, Chandler\'s
readiness to write off classical rights-based liberalism is based on his
examination of the discourse of state-building. Would he say the same
thing about changes in political discourse in France? It happens to be
the case that the new discourse is heavily Anglo-Saxon in tone and so
not surprisingly predominates in Anglo-Saxon countries and in those
international organisations that fall under the influence of Anglo-Saxon
ways of thinking. This does not mean that the discourse is fully
hegemonic. For example, if we look at recent UK and French security
papers, we find a great deal of scepticism in France as to whether an
'Anglo-Saxon' concept such as resilience can make it across the
Channel.[29](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21693293.2013.765741)29
Jonathan Joseph, "Resilience in UK and French Security Strategy: An
Anglo-Saxon Bias," Politics (2013).View all notes And even in the
Anglo-Saxon world the 'new' discourse of responsibility does not make
much sense without the 'old' discourse of rights. To invert Tony
Blair\'s saying, there are no responsibilities without rights. These
rights may now be heavily compromised. But it is difficult to see how
Chandler could make the point that something like sovereignty is
conditional without there still being something to which this
conditionality applies. Chandler argues that new forms of intervention
assume that people are incapable of bearing policy responsibility, hence
abandoning both liberal conceptions of sovereignty and liberal
conceptions of the individual as politically autonomous. This moves us
to the second issue which is that which Foucault calls the independence
of the governed. Chandler sees this as being undermined because the new
discourse problematises the autonomy of both states and individuals.
[Individual autonomy, rather than being the starting point for a
rationalist liberal politics, is now merely an ideal that has to be
striven towards by removing institutional
blocks.]{.underline}[30](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21693293.2013.765741)30

governance. Except that interventions centre on the lack of this
independence. Hence the paternalistic discourse of failed states,

a person does to improve or maintain their physical and mental health
and well-being. It involves [the cultivation of]{.underline} [habits and
behaviours]{.underline} which are pe[rcieved to be good]{.underline}
[rather than destructive]{.underline}, and empahasises the importance of
personal responsibility. [However, self]{.underline}-care as a concept
and [as [a performed activity]{.mark} is vague]{.underline} [and
contradictory]{.underline}. It is [at once empowering]{.underline},
[radical and conservative]{.underline}. [Audre
[Lorde]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in her collection of writings on
her experience of cancer, [[declared caring for herself]{.mark} [to be
'an act of political warfare']{.mark}]{.underline}. Lorde's caring for
herself is **[radical in the sense she is ensuring her survival in world
in which she is not cared for or supported]{.underline}** (Ahmed, 2014).
This not just the survival of her physical body, but her identity as a
black lesbian in a system which is difficult to endure with such an
identity. Here self-care is not directed at flourishing or happiness,
values which so easily leave themselves open to quanitifcation or
commodification, but "finding ways to exist in a world that" diminishes
Lorde, her identity and her body (Ahmed, 2014). [Self-care [in this
sense is practical,]{.mark} [yes,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[but it is also
a political statement. It says my body and bodies like mine are worthy
of support and should be allowed to exist]{.underline}]{.mark}. So [in
this sense it is individualistic]{.underline}, but also extends beyond
the individual. Furthermore, beyond identity politics, self-care as
resistance is our ability to remain fluid and create new 'lines of
escape' (Seem, 1997, p.xvii) -- it can produce ways to be other than the
neoliberal subject. However, [self-care can also be understood as a
technique of power]{.underline} (Ball & Olmedo, 2012) which operates
through the subject. The subject here is defined as "a constant
beginning but also a constant end" (Ball & Olmedo, 2012, p.87). The
subject is in a constant state of flux, caught up in a series of power
relations. In this sense the subject becomes the site of struggle,
resistance and dominance. [[The rhetoric of self-care has been]{.mark}
[utilised for]{.mark} the purpose of [savin]{.mark}g [money for the
NHS]{.mark}]{.underline} (Self Care Forum, 2016[), [as well as]{.mark} a
method of [producing subjects who internalize]{.mark} the desires of
[neoliberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Self-**[[care is a technique of
power though which a neoliberal subjectivity is
produced]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[in [which all relations of the
subject are commodified]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Self-care becomes a
duty for one's flourishing and this flourishing is cased in terms of
being a productive subject in the neoliberal
syste]{.mark}m]{.underline}**. Furthermore, the practice of [[self-care
can]{.underline} [be]{.underline}]{.mark} criticized for being [a
[performance of normativity]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the
[continued reinforcement of westernised]{.mark}]{.underline} [[ideas on
agency and selfhood]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it places responsibility on
the individual for their behavior. Conservative forms of self-care tend
to present the subject as a static entity to be controlled and
protected. For example relaxation techniques are promoted as a form
self-care. Undoubtedly [[relaxation]{.underline}
[techniques]{.underline}]{.mark} can have their benefit for our
well-being, but equally they can [[serve as a distraction
from]{.underline}]{.mark} or obscure the reasons for [[our
pain]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as well as repressing]{.underline} [the
tensions of the self]{.underline}. The focus of my dissertation is
self-care in the context of mental health. The geographies of mental
health emerged out of a movement in social and cultural geography to be
more socially active and radical; to challenge the political status quo
and reveal how 'oppressive relations' are 'expressed spatially' (Philo,
2005, p.585). As a field that embraces working in an interdisciplinary
fashion the geographies of mental health are intimately connected to
psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience, whether through utilizing the
medical language and terminology of psychiatry (particularly in the
quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of mental health
disorders) or criticizing the medical models of psychiatry (connected to
the anti-psychiatry movement). Geographies of mental health aim to show
the relationship between space and experience, understanding that space
is not merely the back drop for experience but that experience 'is
constituted as space' (Tucker, 2010, p.3). [[Our experiences do not just
belong to us but are in a complex]{.underline} [series
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[relations with other bodies]{.mark} and
objects in that space]{.underline}. How and what sort of subjectivities
are being produced in such spaces? In the context of mental health,
geographers have been keenly interested in spaces of enclosure and
exclusion such as the asylum or the mental hospital (Philo, 2005. More
recently [the focus]{.underline} has been [on]{.underline} the [movement
towards the]{.underline} more dispersed spaces of community care, such
as [drop-in centers]{.underline} and [workshops,]{.underline} as well as
the activity of place-making and certain spaces [become significant
to]{.underline} [individuals in their recovery from mental
illness]{.underline} (Tucker, 2009. Duff, 2012. McGrath, Reavey and
Brown 2008). Recent work on the geographies of mental health have
utilized an understanding of experience which works to decentralize a
humanist approach, by defining experience as something broader and less
precise. McGrath, Reavey and Brown describe experience as 'the myriad
ways in which actions, sensations and thinking entangle organic (and to
some extent inorganic) processes together' (2008, p.58). In this way
experience is the process of relations between different types of
bodies. An individual's experience can be understood as how they relate
to and become entangled with different bodies. They call this a process
of engagement (McGrath, Reavey and Brown, 2008, p.58). Experience
reimagined as process means it is ever unfolding. [The problematic
individualized status of]{.underline} [self-care is challenged
through]{.underline} the application of affect theory to [our
understanding of space and bodies]{.underline}. Cameron Duff uses
Deleuze's ideas on fluidity, relationality and the body to recast
recovery as an 'always-unfinished event' or a form of becoming (2015,
p.59). Mental health is not typified as static states of wellness or
un-wellness but a process of 'becoming-well' which ebbs and flows and
modulates dependent on a body's capacity to form new affective relations
with other bodies. He adopts the term 'assemblages of health' to
describe how different bodies and forces come into relation in the
project of recovery. This is a movement away from understanding mental
health as belonging to, defining or being the product of a particular
individual. Duff argues that [[an understanding of agency as
dispersed]{.underline},]{.mark} no longer the privilege of the
individual being human, [[could be 'radically
destigmatising']{.underline}]{.mark} (2015, p.64) [as it]{.underline}
[avoids the conflation of mental health and identity]{.underline}.
[Understanding mental health as not [belonging to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[individuals]{.mark} [could allow for]{.mark} more [holistic approaches

construct less damaging relationships with their experience of mental

#### **Self care is a bad tactic---it reinforces neoliberal individualist narratives**

**Gordon 18** (Bryce Gordon, March 12th, 2018, "Self-Improvement and
Self-Care: Survival Tactics of Late Capitalism", Socialist Revolution,
<https://socialistrevolution.org/self-improvement-and-self-care-survival-tactics-of-late-capitalism>,
accessed 7-13-19)//sjp

However, the right-wing manifestation of individualist ideology is only
part of it. [On the other hand, we see self-care culture, whose
proponents are primarily liberal-leaning and openly embrace the language
of mental health. This subculture suggests measures such as splurging,
treating yourself, adjusting your diet and exercise habits, drinking
water, seeking therapy, meditating, living holistically, and thinking
positively as solutions to the rising rates of depression and
anxiety]{.underline}. The cause of psychological ails, this logic
suggests, is simply that people have lost focus on themselves. If only
people would treat themselves better, then perhaps they would feel
better. But aside from a narrow understanding of why human needs like
proper nutrition and relaxation have declined in quality in recent
decades, proponents of this subculture incorrectly believe that
depression and anxiety are privatized problems---the result of mere
chemical imbalances in the brains of individuals. [The rise of self-care
culture is reflected in its cooptation by the self-help
industry]{.underline}. In an article titled "The Millennial Obsession
With Self-Care," NPR reports that millennials spend twice as much as
baby boomers on products related to self-care. This is especially
telling as millennials have been blamed for "killing" a range of
industries because they have less disposable income than previous
generations. The fact that millions of young people choose to spend
their limited funds on self-care is indicative of deep dissatisfaction
with capitalist society. [Of course, it is good that a growing number of
people are trying to address their mental health and that they are
concerned with destigmatizing it. But more broadly, it highlights
worrying developments about our public health, however positive the
temporary, individual results of self-care may be. Trends and
subcultures do not develop by accident or without cause. The emergence
of these parallel phenomena reflects the broader trend of rising rates
of depression and anxiety, as well as generalized dissatisfaction with
life under capitalism and a search for answers to life's
difficulties.]{.underline} And although they both appeal to groups who
consider themselves opposed to one another, they are ultimately two
sides of the same idealistic, individualist coin. [Both subcultures
suggest that we can address systemic problems through individual
actions---a petty-bourgeois, utopian fantasy.]{.underline} Both
subcultures present logically flawed solutions. Common sentiments among
the self-improvement camp are the need to "clean your room!" and the
idea that before you have any right to criticize society, you must get
your own life together. But what if there are societal reasons for the
difficulties you face in getting your life together? What do you do if
you cannot find work, afford a gym membership, or proper nutrition? What
if you do everything "right" and still find yourself defeated by market
forces? And what if you cannot afford self-care products and services,
or lack the time necessary for treating yourself due to your work
schedule? Do we really want to live in a world in which the majority of
our free time is spent recovering from and overcompensating for the
relentless pressures of capitalism? [Clearly, changes in lifestyle are
not sufficient on their own, and not possible for all.]{.underline} This
does not at all mean that Marxists oppose self-improvement and self-care
as such. There is nothing wrong with many of the activities suggested by
either subculture, nor would socialism be a world without individual
care and development. [On the contrary, we oppose capitalism, in part,
because it directly disincentivizes self-enrichment, encouraging the
accumulation of capital or higher wages above everything else. Under
capitalism, an individual who chooses to prioritize their hobbies and
social well-being runs the risk of being "outcompeted" by those more
willing to subordinate those needs to the logic of profit
motive.]{.underline}

###  AT Settler Colonialism

#### Capitalisim Perpetuates Settler Colonial Violence 

Benjamin **Balthaser**, 11-16-2016, associate professor of multi-ethnic
US literature at Indiana University \"Colonies and Capital,\" No
Publication,
https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/native-americans-marxism-colonialism-nodapl-archie-phinney-means-nez-perce

Phinney's life and work open up a set of questions about identity and
praxis that still have purchase on the national imaginary about Native
Americans. As Dunbar-Ortiz recently articulated, the most persistent
myth about indigenous Americans is that they have vanished, part of a
premodern past that has inevitably, if tragically, come and gone. The
notion that "Indians have missed out on modernity" has justified their
erasure from history and the logic for their conquest. The little
attention paid to Phinney only reinforces this. Historians have tended
to present him as either an Indian activist, uninterested in socialism,
or as a "white man's Indian" who adopted European ideas unsuited for
Native life. But he was much more like other intellectuals of color of
his day --- concerned with colonialism, racial identity, and
self-determination for his people in a global context. His belief that
Native issues should matter to the Left and that Marxism has a role to
play in indigenous liberation does not make Phinney a lone iconoclast
--- rather, it places his work in a global context that understands
indigeneity, land, imperialism, and modernity as part of a coherent
historical conjuncture. Phinney's work suggests that modernity and
Native American life need to be theorized together, and his ideas about
what modern life may represent for all subaltern groups bears greater
scrutiny. [The questions he posed to the Nimi'ipuu apply to [many groups
that find themselves alienated,]{.mark} dispossessed, [and exploited by
capitalism]{.mark}: how to move forward as "alert, modern communities"
that are "able to govern their affairs"? Equally, how do we transform
the categories capitalism imposes upon us into modes of collective
self-consciousness? Phinney understood that [capitalism has a global,
totalizing logic]{.mark}. But he also realized that this does not mean
all subjects' oppression --- or liberation --- is configured in the same
way. He anticipated the largest, hemispheric pan-tribal gathering in
many decades at the NoDAPL camp, and also saw that [the fight to save
the Standing Rock Sioux's land, water, and treaty claims participate in
a larger struggle over intensified resource extraction, primary
accumulation, toxic racism, and the police state.]{.mark} Framing
themselves as "water defenders," the Standing Rock Sioux tribe both
dramatizes the violation of their sovereign rights as a nation over
their own resources, and connects them to a global struggle to wrest the
foundational requirements of life, water, soil, and air from the grips
of capital. [In]{.mark} much [the same way]{.mark} Phinney writes about
race, such [a construction highlights]{.mark} what is specific to
indigenous struggle, while at the same time connecting that struggle to
a transnational call [for ecological justice. Fighting for indigenous
sovereignty does not distract from transforming capitalist
modernity]{.mark} --- it is central to it.]{.underline}

#### The aff's decolonization of presence is meaningless -- control isn't maintained through overt policing, instead neocolonialism functions through domination of economic relations and the international division of labor -- only the alternative solves 

**Azikiwe 14** - editor of the Pan-African News Wire, co-founder of
several Detroit-area organizations including The Detroit Coalition
Against Police Brutality,(May 6, Abayomi, \"Higher concentrations of
wealth and growing class divisions represent the decline of world
capitalism\"
www.whenthenewsstops.org/2014/06/neo-colonialism-and-changing-nature-of.html)

V.I. Lenin provided the most comprehensive as well as succinct
definition of imperialism in his famous book, "Imperialism, the Highest
Stage of Capitalism" that was published during World War I. In this book
[Lenin deals with changing character of imperialism and the supremacy of
international finance capital as the dominant interests within the world
capitalist system]{.underline}. After nearly a century, [Lenin's
study]{.underline} of the changing economic character of world
capitalism [remains important in understanding the nature of
international relations and the class character of modern society.
Wealth has become even more concentrated]{.underline} during the first
two decades of the 21st century despite monumental strides in the areas
of technological development and industrial productivity. Lenin said in
Chapter VII of this above-mentioned work that "If it were necessary to
give the briefest possible definition of imperialism we should have to
say that **[[imperialism is the monopoly stage of
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Such a definition would include what
is most important, for, on the one hand, finance capital is the bank
capital of a few very big monopolist banks, merged with the capital of
the monopolist associations of industrialists; and, on the other hand[,
the division of the world is the transition from a colonial policy which
has extended without hindrance to territories unseized by any capitalist
power, to a colonial policy of monopolist possession of the territory of
the world, which has been completely divided up]{.underline}." The two
World Wars fought during the first half of the 20th century were
designed to carve up the spoils of colonial conquest and exploitation.
Nonetheless, these wars could not resolve the quest for hegemony by the
imperialist states, of course, due to the intervention of the masses of
workers and peasants who rose up during the aftermath of these
conflagrations. Imperialism and Neo-Colonialism Dr. Kwame [Nkrumah, a
leader in the Gold Coast Revolution]{.underline} (later Ghana) [and a
proponent of Pan-Africanism and Socialism, later identified
neo-colonialism as the final phase of imperialism]{.underline} in a book
he published in 1965 entitled "Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of
Imperialism" issued on the eve of his removal from power by a Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) engineered coup in Feb. 1966. The
[[colonial]{.underline}]{.mark} and semi-colonial [[powers **may
relinquish the appearance of control**]{.mark} through the recognition
of independent states]{.underline} and their governments, **[[yet they
maintain their quest for hegemony through the control of the
international division of labor and the dominance over the economic
relations of production, ownership and trade.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Nkrumah wrote in the chapter entitled "The Mechanisms of
Neo-Colonialism," that "[Faced with the militant peoples of the
ex-colonial territories]{.underline} in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and
Latin America, [**[imperialism simply switches
tactics]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Without a qualm it dispenses with its
flags]{.underline}, and even with certain of its more hated expatriate
officials. [This means, so it claims, that it is 'giving' independence
to its former subjects, to be followed by 'aid' for their
development.]{.underline} **[[Under cover of such
phrases]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [it devises innumerable ways to
accomplish objectives formerly achieved by naked
colonialism.]{.underline} It is this sum total of these modern attempts
to perpetuate colonialism while at the same time talking about
'freedom', which has come to be known as neo-colonialism." In the
following paragraph, Nkrumah then goes on to identify the principal
enemy of the forces of national liberation, anti-imperialism and
socialism throughout the world. He notes that "Foremost among the
neo-colonialists is the United States, which has long exercised its
power in Latin America. Fumblingly at first she turned towards Europe,
and then with more certainty after world war two when most countries of
that continent were indebted to her. Since then, with methodical
thoroughness and touching attention to detail, the Pentagon set about
consolidating its ascendancy, evidence of which can be seen all around
the world." [These words still carry resonance in the second decade of
the 21st century. **[The motivations behind imperialist militarism are
based upon their attempts to maintain control of the economic resources
of the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In relationship to the situation
in Africa]{.underline} today [there appears to be a counter-narrative
related to the reports of phenomenal economic growth while at the same
time the ominous threat of "global terrorism" provides a rationale for
deepening]{.underline} military and intelligence
[interventions]{.underline}. Although the U.S. is leading in this
approach, other imperialist states such as France, Britain, Canada and
Germany are also heavily involved. The formation of the United States
Africa Command (AFRICOM) signaled a renewed threat to the sovereignty of
the continent. In this current phase of post-colonial history, the
Pentagon, the CIA and NATO forces along with the State of Israel are
involved in numerous African states. [Under the guise of providing
emerging African states with assistance]{.underline} in enhancing their
internal security apparatuses to guard against "terrorism," [the African
Union member-states are becoming less stable and incapable of resolving
their own internal problems. This contradiction also has served to
undermine the tenuous existence of African unity]{.underline} as
demonstrated in the EU-Africa summit held in Brussels, Belgium. The
Domestic Character of Neo-Colonialism [When the character of imperialism
is analyzed it cannot be merely limited to foreign policy
concerns]{.underline} of the Western capitalist states. [Within the
domestic confines of these countries there are oppressed nations that
have been subjected to domination and super-exploitation]{.underline}.
[In the U.S., the growing populations of African Americans, Latinos,
Asian Americans, Middle Eastern communities, etc., are creating the
conditions for major shifts]{.underline} in the political culture of the
country. Consequently[, a renewed series of attacks are being carried
out against these populations under the rubric of privatization aimed at
capitalist re-structuring]{.underline}. [For example in Detroit, the
banks have driven nearly a quarter-of-a-million people, mainly African
Americans, from the city]{.underline} over the last decade-and-a-half.
This assault on the population was carried out utilizing economic means
such as home foreclosures and predatory municipal lending engineered by
the financial institutions. The imposed emergency management and forced
bankruptcy of Detroit, the largest per capita African American populated
municipality in the U.S., was carried out not by the people who live in
the city but by racist right-wing governor utilizing a dictator who
works as an agent of the banks. This is why we raised the slogan "Cancel
the Debt." We realize that [the current situation was created by the
criminal actions of international finance capital carried out on a
domestic level]{.underline}. [These attacks]{.underline} against the
people of Detroit and other municipalities in Michigan, most of whom
have majority African American populations, [are also designed to set a
precedence for the nationwide seizure of public pension funds, public
assets, the privatization of schools, the driving down of
wages]{.underline} and the theft of any semblance of even bourgeois
democratic practice and norms. This is why the most advanced forces in
Detroit have reached out to nationally oppressed and working class
communities throughout the U.S. and indeed the world.

#### Weapons prolif based on consumer ideologies and has the best explanation for imperialism 

{this is weird, you gotta concede that gun violence was used against
natives but, the cards is like lmao but that's Colt and other gun
companies fault)

**Sean Larson 18** (socialistworker.org, THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF "GUN
CULTURE", Sean Larson looks at the history of the U.S. gun industry,
which has worked closely with the military for over a century to ensure
that our society is flooded with weapons.
https://socialistworker.org/2018/03/01/the-political-economy-of-gun-culture)
**Wolfy UwU**

THERE ARE over 300 million privately held guns in the United States, a
number far higher than any other country. The mere presence of guns does
not produce violence\--that must be attributed to the crimes of poverty,
socially crippling alienation and seething hatreds that thrive in this
most capitalist of societies. But we can understand that and still fully
agree with what student Emma Gonzalez said after Nikolas Cruz murdered
17 people at her high school: \"He wouldn\'t have harmed that many
students with a knife.\" A country saturated with guns makes it more
likely that reactionary tendencies in our society will lead to
fatalities. Whether wielded by heavily armed police, mass shooters or
right-wingers, the sheer volume of guns in the U.S. serves to militarize
underlying social conflicts. Why are there so many guns? Many
commentators have pointed to what is often known as gun culture. When
people here buy guns, the reasoning goes, they\'re really buying a
certain image of American-ness: a whitewashed legacy of the American
frontier, with gruff, self-reliant men who fought for freedom, and so
on. [But these discussions often miss an obvious point: guns are
commodities, and people who purchase guns are gun consumers. Gun
culture, and the associated political mythos, is largely rooted in a
consumer culture. In other words, guns don\'t sell guns; capitalists do.
The invention of the modern gun culture behind today\'s proliferation of
weapons is a relatively recent phenomenon, cultivated in the service of
profit.]{.underline} AFTER THE Civil War ended in 1865, major gun
manufacturers were faced with a dilemma: how to create a civilian gun
market when the major demand from the military had fallen off sharply.
Pamela Haag, author of The Gunning of America: Business and the Making
of American Gun Culture, describes how the founder of Winchester
\"needed to untether his rifle from the formal war and the military
market, and think about the private army of one, in a kind of
military-civilian market infiltration not evident in other contexts.\"
[In the post-Civil War era, the genocidal Westward expansion into Indian
country provided a ready circumstance into which guns could be marketed.
The historian Richard Hofstadter\'s essay on American gun culture
describes how Indians in their Native land were \"all too often regarded
by American frontiersmen as another breed of wild animal.\" Indeed, in
the 1870s, Winchester advertised its Model 66 as useful for \"Indian,
Bear or Buffalo hunting.\" These early links between gun sales and
imperial expansion, however, **were nothing compared to the cultural
campaigns launched a few decades later.** As Haag puts it, \"The modern
gun might have been invented mechanically in the nineteenth century, but
it was invented politically in the twentieth.]{.underline}
Paradoxically, war continued to create a dilemma for gun manufacturers
who were reliant on a stable market. The history of how they solved this
dilemma explains some of the ways in which U.S. imperialism interacts
with, and reinforces, the domestic gun market. [In the early 20th
century, Taylorist scientific management was introduced in the major gun
factories, and small manufacturers shifted toward mass production and
enormous capital outlays. Even as the need for guns receded, guns were
continually produced because it was more cost-efficient to run the
gigantic factories at a loss than halt production entirely and thereby
cut losses for already-invested capital.]{.underline} Exports and
military sales had declined by the eve of the First World WarI\--the
bulk of gun production being sold to the domestic civilian market. So it
was actually with reluctance that the gun industry entered into military
contracts for the war. They had been orienting on a reliable domestic
commercial market for decades, while sudden expansion and
conversion\--and the enormous debt assumed to achieve it\--was
inherently risky. During the war, contracts for the U.S. and allied
militaries drastically expanded gun production facilities. But planners
were already anticipating the postwar problem of, as Haag puts it, \"too
many guns and too much capacity for too little demand.\" Looking ahead
to an era of mass production and diminishing practical need for guns,
sales and marketing teams set out to construct and reinforce an ideal
gun consumer. THE YEARS after the end of the First World War gave rise
to the strongest wave of radicalism in U.S. history. This was the heyday
of the Industrial Workers of the World and the birth of the Communist
Party, general strikes and even experiments in workers control, as well
as race riots in many cities. [Haag describes how gun manufacturers took
the opportunity to monetize racism and fears of radicalism by
advertising \"riot guns\" to business owners looking to protect their
shops from \"disturbances, either racial or political,\" and promoting
their firearms as the only surefire way to protect the \"industrial life
of the nation.\"]{.underline} Such overt efforts to militarize existing
class conflicts were part and parcel of a broader plan that Winchester
called \"the biggest and most carefully planned national advertising
campaign ever undertaken by any firm of gun makers in the world.\" The
other major wing of this campaign involved the direct organizing of gun
clubs, or the resurrection of older clubs that had deteriorated. First
and foremost, the campaign highlighted militarism. An advertising
campaign launched by Colt blurred the lines between war and peacetime,
and placed responsibility for lawfulness not on government agencies, but
the individual and his Colt Automatic. Companies like Remington created
young boys\' rifle clubs and \"Junior Rifle Corps\" to court an emerging
customer base. Rifles were pushed on sometimes reluctant parents through
advertising that promised to \"make a man of any boy\" and develop the
\"sturdy manliness that every real boy wants to have.\" Haag\'s business
history says more about American masculinity than many cultural close
readings: Today, there is a popular sense that the deep association of
guns and masculinity is almost inborn to the nation\'s collective
unconscious. Seen from the archives of the gun business, it is something
energetically invoked and defined on ad copy for weekly magazines, and
then amplified and duplicated thousands of times over with other forms
of mass advertisement. CULTURE, HOWEVER, isn\'t created by ad campaigns
and gun clubs alone. The economic co-dependence of the military and
private manufacturers allowed the gun mythology to flourish. \"The
vitality of public, common defense tacitly relied on the vitality of the
private, commercial gun market,\" Haag writes, \"\--and this tense
interdependency is a largely forgotten part of the story of how
America\'s civilian gun culture emerged.\" [In the first part of the
20th century, the U.S. military depended on a weapons supply from
private arms makers, and needed to ensure that their civilian markets
remained unregulated by thwarting legislative proposals for gun
restrictions. The War Department opposed any restrictions on gun sales
on the grounds that the \"continuance in existence of our arms and
ammunitions manufactures\" were \"vital to national
defense.\"]{.underline} Gun industrialists, for their part, argued in a
press release from the 1930s cited by Haag, that \"American
manufacturers of guns and munitions cannot remain in business by waiting
for wars. There must be continuous sale of their products, as in any
other industry.\" [As a Colt representative testified before Congress
around the same time, \"We were very valuable to the government during
the war. We cannot maintain a plant to assist the government in cause of
war, unless we can stay in business.\"]{.underline} This was a lesson,
Haag points out, that \"every gun industrialist had learned in every
decade: gun markets are fragile, gun demand not always reliable, and
profit margins thin, such that a tax and a registration inconvenience\"
would \"kill their small arms business\--and, in turn, their ability to
make arms for public defense in times of war.\" The military-commercial
interdependence continued into the Cold War, as the U.S. carved out
spheres of influence and increasingly became the world\'s chief weapons
repository. Although it is beyond the scope of her book, Haag questions
whether this made civilian gun regulation in the U.S. more difficult:
One could hypothesize that it is not just that we have more gun industry
because we have fewer gun regulations, but that we have fewer gun
regulations because we have more gun industry. And, one could add, we
have more gun industry because of the extent of U.S. imperialist
oversight throughout the 20th century. As the Second World War was
coming to a close in the mid-1940s, a surplus of militarily obsolescent
but still functional guns poured into the U.S.\--the only viable market
for them in the world. The urban rebellions of the 1960s, the Black
Panthers\' armed march on the California State Capitol and the
assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy led Congress to pass the Gun
Control Act of 1968. The NRA testified in support of many of the
restrictions in the proposed law, although it opposed the provision
creating a national registry of all guns. In the next decade, however,
the increasingly right wing political climate and a series of internal
incidents shifted the NRA from a sporting group to an uncompromising
political force of the right. An ATF raid on a longtime NRA member
prompted the organization to shift its platform and appropriate Second
Amendment language to protect individual rights against the
encroachments of the federal government. The NRA\'s turn from a sporting
club to a conservative political organization culminated in 1977 with an
internal coup by a hardline group within the organization. This was part
and parcel of a larger conservative backlash happening at the time,
which included the employers\' offensive and the racist War on Drugs.
From then on, the NRA became a cultural warrior championing the
reactionary themes of American individualism, masculinity and racism.
Aside from its novel interpretation of the Second Amendment, most of the
organization\'s right-wing themes drew from previous efforts by weapons
manufacturers in their efforts to create and sustain a civilian market.
[The permanent celebration of guns in civilian culture has been a useful
justification for permanent war-readiness industrially.]{.underline}

#### **Capitalism has been antithetical to the Indigenous Native's way of living -- No advocacy can change the foundations of that violence unless we first remove the expansion of Capitlism** 

**Taylor 17,** Melania Benson, The Convenient Indian: How Activists Get
Native Americans Wrong,
https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-convenient-indian-how-liberals-get-native-americans-wrong/#!

INDIANS HAVE BEEN in all the headlines about the protests against the
Dakota Access Pipeline. But unfortunately, most of the stories haven't
been about Indians at all. The protests included presidential hopeful
Bernie Sanders, and celebrities like Mark Ruffalo and Shailene Woodley,
who was arrested last fall. Countless others took to social media to
proclaim, "We Stand with Standing Rock. #waterislife[." [The narrative
here is so timeworn as to be banal: every epoch of American history has
featured the callous removal of indigenous obstacles to the expansion of
corporate capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark} A march on Washington earlier
this month made the symbology plain: circling the Washington Monument
were a phalanx of white teepees, erected by indigenous protesters and
allies who descended on the National Mall for a four-day long protest
against the Trump administration and its policies. [[The tableau
presented by nearly every news outlet was stark: this was American
Indians versus the federal government; Big Chiefs versus Big Oil;
spirituality versus capitalism. But the optics of the protest have been
misleading. Indians have simply functioned far too long and incoherently
as ciphers for anti-establishment and anticapitalist idealism, and not
just for white liberals. The phenomenon has been a national tradition of
sorts at least since the Boston Tea Party, when the aggrieved subjects
of a fledgling nation donned Mohawk disguises to toss their pecuniary
burdens into the sea. Twenty-first-century Tea Partiers similarly
protested Obama's tax plan while garbed in homemade headdresses,
warpaint, and signs that read "On Warpath Against More Taxes!,"
"Paleface Taxes Too High," and "Let Little Brave Keep Wampum" (this last
directive affixed strategically to the shirt of a protester's young
child).]{.underline}]{.mark} Indians have been irresistible
victim-symbols for anybody who wants to join a struggle against
colonial-capitalist aggression. But Indians have always been held to
unfair standards of representation --- expected to function as foils for
not just our hopes but our deepest fears as Americans. While liberals
have understandably partnered with the indigenous cause at Standing
Rock, conservative pundits leaped at the chance to condemn Native
Americans for their inveterate decision to stand as outsiders of polite
society. But Indians have always been held to unfair standards of

partnered with the indigenous cause at Standing Rock, conservative
pundits leaped at the chance to condemn Native Americans for their
inveterate decision to stand as outsiders of polite society. In a recent
Forbes article, David Blackmon derides the "deadbeat protesters" for
their "illegal" and "shameful conduct," leading to the costly cleanup of
the demonstration camps]{.underline} --- a twisted irony given the
potential ecological devastation that the protesters tried valiantly to
curb. Seizing on the unfortunate fact that several dogs were left behind
after the evacuation, Fox News took an uncanny turn as PETA-style animal
defenders, tacitly censuring the protesters for the "extremely sad"
condition of the mange-ridden and frostbitten animals. These dizzying
rhetorical moves are at least as old as America, where Indians have
always been Janus-faced symbols for our shifting fortunes and values. It
should be no surprise that the indigenous motif has resurfaced in the
wake of our revivified crises of faith and capitalism following the
election of a corporate mogul by the poorest, angriest sectors of our
nation.

Colonialism, she argues, served as "an escape valve for the mother
country." Peasants thrown off their lands with the enclosure of the
commons were assuaged with an offer of land "where they could be lord,"
she says. But poor settlers too were "duped." "[Corporations are
predators to everyone now,]{.underline}" she said. Understanding
indigenous history not only reveals a lot about how we all live and why;
reconnecting the dots of this history gives glimpses of alternatives and

The text has been edited lightly for publication. Laura Flanders: I got
\[the message\] very strongly that this isn't necessarily a book for
indigenous people. They may well know this history. It's for the rest of
us. Why is it needed? Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz: It's for everyone to
understand, for the settlers, for the immigrants, to understand
indigenous people's experience of the United States and point of view.
As a historian, I really wanted to call it the True History of the
United States because it's not just that there are two points of view.
There are the colonizer and the colonized, but do you really want to
identify with the colonizers? ...[[It also speaks to me of the reality
that we've had experiences of different economic systems in the United
States on this territory, on this continent. Going back and thinking
about the pre-capitalist culture is liberating, also in the sense that
you stop equating "civilization" with a particular economic
system.]{.underline}]{.mark} There was another one[. Yes, and it was
socialistic. Indigenous **socialism[. Collectively -- this is why native
property wasn't recognized: Because it was collectively owned and then
they tried to allot it. They literally put in the Dawes Act
]{.mark}**]{.underline}[([the Allotment
Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Act)) **[that selfishness had
to be created for civilization to flourish among the native
people.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The other aspect that I think that we
have to be aware of is that every inch of territory that is now the
United States was taken by warfare. War on the native people, many of
these were genocidal wars, and in every case, native people resisted in
one way or another to stay on their land: they don't just give up. In
this 300 years of warfare, 100 of it under the United States republic
preceded by 200 years of settler-colonial warfare, most of it by local
armed militias, a certain kind of warfare developed that was the root
and foundation of the US military. Acted out time and again: you look at
Vietnam, it resonated so much with the Indian wars. [They even use a lot
of the same terminology that they used, like "Indian
Country."]{.underline} There is so much more in the book and I really
encourage people to really look at it. [You are pretty critical of
corporations and foundations and their relationship to native land and
native issues.]{.underline} Do you want to talk about that? Corporations
are predators to everyone now, but **[[native people are kind of the
canaries in the mine in the 19th century]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The
[United States government]{.mark}]{.underline} -- which had a federal
trust responsibility under the treaties to protect native land from
outsiders, from settlers coming in or companies coming in -- **[[instead
did the opposite and would give leases and give contracts without
consulting the native people. So the corporations ran rampant from the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In
Oklahoma, it was mainly petroleum and mining. All through the West,
mining and seizing land, simply transferring it or making native land
into so-called public lands that is then leased out to the government.

#### **Simply attempting to tackle reform or top level issues will never address the social system that has run counter to the lifestyle and culture of Indegenous Natives -- Refuse the lies the 1AC and their poisoned kool-aid for a more life-affirming reality.**

[[The Heresy of Capitalism Threatens Well Being in Indian
Country]{.underline}]{.mark} [Duane Champagne's recent
article](https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/2013/10/06/breaking-cycle-poverty-and-crime-indian-country-151430)
on violence and poverty in Indian country is, sadly, a stark reminder
that in the big picture not much has really changed for America's first
peoples. These are indicators of suffering; to be born Indian is to be
born into a culture plagued by multigenerational suffering. He rightly
points out that [[high crime rates are symptoms of deeper social and
cultural distress and that addressing poverty is only a partial
solution.]{.underline}]{.mark} He cites college education, better
housing, restoral of individual health, cultural renewal, and enhanced
tribal self-government as necessary to lowering crime rates. Yes to all
of the above, I say. Champagne also quite predictably mentions [the
creation of jobs and "market sustainability" as crime
deterrents.]{.underline} Of course, this is the conventional wisdom of
how to create social well-being within a capitalist, market-based
system. [Economics is the god that free-market capitalism (and even
socialism) worships, and to suggest that capitalist fundamentalism is a
false religion is to commit heresy.]{.underline} I'm not afraid to admit
I'm a capitalism heretic. [[Settler colonialism effectively discredited
and dismantled Indigenous social systems including science and economic
systems]{.mark}]{.underline} (and, yes, we had our own science and
economic systems[). The systems replacing them--market and wage based
economies--were entirely foreign to our ways of being in the world, and
caused further social devastation. In essence we became social
laboratory experiments to prove the superiority of European civilization
compared to our own Earth-centered cultures. I think by now we all know
how well that has worked out for us.]{.underline} The problem is that
not only has it not worked out well for our Indian communities, it's not
working out well for anyone else on the planet, two-legged, four-legged,
winged, crawlers, swimmers or anyone else, except perhaps for the 1
percent or so at the top of the economic food chain. **[[The changing
climate is a direct result of the industrial age and mass consumerism
that Western societies glorified as true "civilization." Already we are
observing catastrophic effects to human and non-human life and it's only
going to get worse. Far worse. Capitalist market fundamentalism at its
most basic level is defined by and depends on the endless exploitation
of natural (and human) resources, or what we normally call economic
growth. The principle of market sustainability holds that the
maintenance of and unrestricted access to markets stimulates growth and
reverses violence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It doesn't take an economics
genius to understand that on a finite planet there is no such thing as
unlimited resources, to say nothing of how the unfettered exploitation
of those resources, especially fossil fuels, is responsible for global
warming. [But more to the point: market-based capitalism is
fundamentally rooted in competition, and competition means there will
always be winners and losers. Its results are an intensely stratified
social class system.]{.underline} So the obvious question is, how can an
economic system that creates such profound differences between the haves
and the have-nots---and thus violent crime---simultaneously prevent
violence? The answer is it can't. It's a fallacy of epic proportions to
think that the invisible hand of an omnipotent market will lead to
social equity. **[[Market-based capitalism runs counter to everything
we've been taught by our ancestors. They taught us cooperation, not
competition. To care for the environment and all the beings in it, not
reckless exploitation. Colonization has programmed us to ignore those
teachings and to invest our well-being in a system that only leads to
illness and death, not life. It's responsible for what the Hopi call
"koyaanisqatsi," or life out of balance. As Native people we are
obligated to our ancestors and to the future seven generations to
imagine a better way to live on the planet.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
kool-aid we drink is when we believe that there is no alternative to the
current paradigm where everything on the Earth is seen as commodities to
develop, not relatives to be respected. And that if we only had more
money, more jobs, more education, better houses to live then we can be
happy. "More" is the language of capitalism and its close companion,
colonialism. But we know that in our worldviews are the keys to
envisioning a different, more sustainable life. It will likely involve
decentralization of power on a global scale and as Dr. Champagne
articulated, enhanced self-government for tribal nations. Increased
regional control will allow communities to determine what is best for
them in a bottom up, not top down manner. A return to more of a
subsistence lifestyle where the things we need for life like food, water
and medicine are not concentrated in the hands of multinational
corporations would be sensible. [[There is a rich and growing body of
literature, scholarship and activism that dares to buck the current
paradigm and imagine alternatives to the death culture of capitalism.
But we must be brave enough to be capitalism heretics. Only then can we
begin to refuse the poisoned kool-aid and choose a more life-affirming
reality.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### We must first understand how the notions of capital and privatization first seeped its way into the Indigenous way of living -- What we realize is that before the land was ever stolen, the Capitalist structure already poisoned the land.

A History of Academic Segregation In American historiography,
scholarship depicting Indians as economic actors on the continental
stage is a recent phenomenon, and that delayed development requires
explanation. A good place to start is with the deeply rooted [[late
nineteenth-century Euro-American conception of Indians as primitive
societies that embodied a superseded stage of human social evolution in
which progressive change was negligible and
undocumented]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indians were people of the past and
people without meaningful history. As members of tribes, they reputedly
held material resources in common - a practice that engendered
stultifying conformity rather than the self-interested striving that
gave modern societies their dynamism. Thus characterized[, [Indians
represented the legal and cultural antithesis of the individuals and
corporations whose profit seeking was the driving force of an
industrializing U.S. economy. Those conceptions prompted historians
virtually to ignore Indians for almost a century, contributing to an
intellectual legacy of Indian exceptionalism that has continuing
influence.]{.underline}]{.mark}6 1 The long-standing dearth of Indians
in American economic history is partly a consequence of academic
specialization that originated with and perpetuated the concept of
Indians as archaic and fated to disappear. Historians after the U.S.
Civil War largely left them to antiquarians and to the emerging
discipline of anthropology except as needed to tell a story of
Euro-American nation building. [This [allocation of intellectual labor
endured for a century, during much of which anthropologists - having
rejected the theory that human societies inexorably evolve from
primitive tribes to civilized nations - did not undertake to chronicle
change over time among Indians.]{.mark}]{.underline} Intent instead on
developing a social science of human cultures, anthropologists
endeavored to catalog and describe indigenous American societies in
their aboriginal state. For the first several decades of the 1 900s the
principal products of that research were ethnographies - portraits of
discrete, obsolescent cultural systems in suspended animation. [Because
they viewed any change that followed from European colonization as a
loss or corruption of Indian culture, ethnographers did not document
Indians part in Americas development.]{.underline}7 Beginning in the
1970s a significant number of historians finally ventured into the
intellectual territory their predecessors had shunned[. There they found
anthropologists laboring in a new field of study dubbed
\"ethnohistory\" - an outgrowth of the need for historical
testimony]{.underline} in proceedings authorized by the Indian Claims
Commission Act of 1 946. The self-described ethnohistorian James Axtell
has described his work as \"the use of historical and ethnological
methods and materials to gain knowledge of the nature and cause of
change in a culture \[or cultures\] defined \[ethnologically\] .\"
Ethnohistory s practitioners are now as apt to be trained in history as
in anthropology, [but their focus on tribal or ethnic groups and their
emphasis on group culture attest to anthropologists\' lasting influence
on the field Another legacy of anthropology\'s long monopoly on the
study of Indians is a body of scholarship that depicts Indian economies
as \"driven by cultural logics radically different from those of
European colonizers.\"]{.underline} The prospect of encountering such
radical difference may be one reason that most economic history scholars
remained aloof regarding Native American economic history while other
historians joined anthropologists in ethnohistorical research on
Indians. **[[Specifically, historians concerned with activity motivated
by material desires may have written off Indians in the belief that
acquiring wealth was not an aboriginal ideal. Such a belief is common,
say three critical scholars, despite abundant evidence that \"economic
incentives\" (including private property rights) \"have been at work
\... as long as people have populated North America.\" Indeed, many
historical studies have accepted and reinforced a dichotomy that
contrasts a communal Indian ethos with a \"rational,\" materialist
\"Western\" ethos. In ethnohistory, for example, scholars who have
emphasized nonutilitarian \"cultural\" motivations of Indian economic
behavior outnumber those who have documented Indian profit
seeking.]{.underline}]{.mark}**9 Differing aims also set economic
historians and anthropologists on divergent paths from which the
historians seldom glimpsed Indians and the anthropologists rarely saw
the larger economic contexts of tribal practices. The discipline of
economic history defined its mission by following the lead of its parent
discipline, economics, which evolved along with modern nation-states and
aspired to explain the extensive systems and complex relations of
production, exchange, and consumption that underwrote those polities.
That aspiration, Patricia Albers notes, was at variance with her fellow
anthropologists\' project of cataloging small-scale aboriginal cultures.
In a 2002 survey of ethnohistorical scholarship on Indian labor and
exchange, Albers lamented that her colleagues often disregarded or
understated the impact of broad forces and material conditions on the
tribal economies they studied.10 Key premises of economics and
anthropology differed as well. According to the intellectual historian
Geoffrey Hodgson, the dominant aspiration of American economists,
especially since World War II, has been to develop theories or models
whose features are \"common to most conceivable social or economic
systems.\" Such models have reflected \"the view of economics as an
expression of human nature or psychology[.\" [The work of many
economists presumes, for example, that ideas such as \"scarcity,
competition and rational self-interest\" are universal. Hodgson adds
that the discipline of economic history felt it \"necessary to prove its
virility\" by exhibiting the same \"spirit of universalism\" as
mainstream economics]{.mark}.]{.underline} Central precepts of economics
have also gained acceptance from historians in other fields. The
language of economics has been so influential that some of its
postulates - that people seek to maximize their wealth with a minimum of
sacrifice, that resources are limited but demand is unlimited, for
example - are widely regarded as natural and culturally neutral matters
of common sense.11 While economists have sought to identify usual and
uniform behavior, anthropologists and ethnohistorians have emphasized
diversity. The anthropologist Stephen Gudeman, for one, argues that
today\'s \"Western notion of rational and material\" economic thought is
time and culture specific. It did not account for the behavior of
indigenous Central Americans he studied. [[Even as his subjects adapted
to elements of a \"modern\" market and labor system, they continued to
act for some purposes according to other, hereditary eco- nomic models
and to think in metaphors that \"Western\" economists would not have
deemed rational.]{.mark}]{.underline} Under the influence of cultural
anthropology, historians of American Indian economic life have tried

### AT Survival Strategies

#### Affirming individual survival maintains an economy of recognition -- that engenders neoliberalism by letting corporations and government alike off the hook for social responsibility and making collective political change structurally impossible.

Silva's account of a transition to adulthood marked not by "entry into
social groups and institutions but rather the explicit rejection of
them" provides a poignant rejoinder to Sennett.19 One man tells Silva
that "the hardest part about being an adult is finding a real fucking
job."20 People aren't lacking a narrative for adulthood. [[Capitalism
presents]{.mark} adulthood as an individual project]{.underline}. For
the young working people Silva interviewed, individualism equals
dignity. [They tell [heroic tales of self-sufficiency]{.mark}, turning
inward as they manage feelings of betrayal, accept flexibility and flux,
and buttress their sense of being utterly alone]{.underline}. Although
the dependencies of the welfare state and corporate bureaucracy that
Lasch associates with the therapeutic sensibility have been dismantled
and replaced by a harsher, more competitive capitalism, [[**therapeutic
language** remains the vocab]{.mark}ulary [through which to account for
individual success]{.mark} and failure]{.underline}. Instead of the
jettisoning of the past that Lasch and Sennett observe, [Silva's
subjects embrace the past as they narrate the challenges they have had
to overcome in order to realize their authentic selves]{.underline}.
Understood in terms of familial and personal experiences, [the past
provides an open field of explanations for hardship, failure, and the
diminution of what they see as success. Unlike]{.underline} Lasch's
[empty narcissists, Silva's young adults have lives of inner
purpose---surviving on their own in a context where the
odds]{.underline} [are against them]{.underline}. They struggle with
illness and battle with addiction. [They overcome dysfunctional families
and past relationships]{.underline}. **[[The fight to survive is the key
feature of an identity imagined as]{.mark} dignified and [heroic because
it has to produce itself]{.mark} by itself]{.underline}**. Silva's
[young adults point to [an imaginary identity beyond the]{.mark} rugged
[individualist]{.mark} and the narcissistic gamesman: [the
**survivor**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Unlike the symbolic identity of
institutions]{.underline} (the place from which one sees oneself as
acting), [imaginary identity is the image one adopts of
oneself.]{.underline} Since so many of Silva's informants feel they have
had to do it all by themselves, in contexts of poverty and diminishing
opportunity, [they take the fact of their survival as the morally
significant fact]{.underline}: [making it on one's own is what bestows
dignity.]{.underline} Some of the white survivors Silva interviews
resent "socialists" like US President Barack Obama for trying to take
away their last best thing, the special something that is all they have
left, namely, the dignity they have because they are completely
self-reliant. **[The [black survivors]{.mark}]{.underline}**, too,
**[[narrate their experiences in individual]{.mark} rather than
collective [terms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[They]{.underline}**, too,
[**seek to hold on to the only person they can count on---themselves**.
Betrayed by schools, the labor market, and the government, Silva's
working-class informants in general feel "completely alone, responsible
for their own fates and dependent on outside help at their peril." For
them, surviving means internalizing the painful lesson that "being an
adult means trusting no one by yourself]{.underline}."21 What Sennett
lauded as a repudiation of dependence appears in Silva's account as a
deep skepticism of solidarity. [Reliance on other people requires
acknowledging one's insufficiency as an individual, one's inability to
survive alone]{.underline}. [The hostility to the needy expressed by
some of Silva informants suggests a defense against their own
need]{.underline}. **[[Hostility lets them displace their need onto
others and thereby shore up a fragile]{.mark} and [impossible
individuality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Having learned that they can't
rely on anyone, these [young working-class adults try to numb their
sense of betrayal by affirming the worst cultural scripts of
individualism, personal responsibility, and self-reliance, hardening
themselves to the world around them]{.underline}. Their hostility to
various forms of government intervention, particularly affirmative
action, makes them ideal supports for neoliberal capitalism.
Incidentally, [those of us who write and circulate critical
exposés]{.underline}---stories of governmental corruption, [university
failure, and corporate malfeasance]{.underline}---[may not be helping
our cause. We may be affirming what some in the working class already
know to be true: they are being betrayed]{.underline}. Likewise
countering Sennett's happy rendering of the repudiation of dependence,
Carrie M. Lane's research on white-collar technology workers in Dallas
situates the emphasis on individual responsibility in the context of
wide-scale layoffs and unemployment.22 Insecurity is a primary feature
of the lives of these tech workers. Most alternate through contract
positions of varying duration, unemployment, and selfemployment.23 Lane
notes how the technology workers she interviewed embrace a "career
management" ideology that casts "insecurity as an empowering alternative
to dependence on a single employer."24 They construe loyalty as a thing
of the past: since everyone is a victim of economic forces beyond their
control, neither companies nor employees owe each other anything. Owners
and workers both want to make money however they can. No one should
expect a company to provide employment security or opportunities for
professional development. Such an expectation indicates a childish
attitude of dependence. According to one executive, "To give my
employees job security would be to disempower them and relieve them of
the responsibility that they need to feel for their own success."25
Laid-off and job-seeking tech workers adopt the corresponding
individualist mindset: success comes from doing "whatever it takes" to
get by, get through, get that next job. [The survivor is a compelling
identity under conditions of extreme competition and inequality. It
validates surviving by any means necessary. Survival is its own
reward.]{.underline} Setbacks and lapses are new challenges, ultimately
greater proof of one's survival skills. [Popular culture provides a wide
array of survivors to emulate]{.underline} (as well as examples of those
who have been unable to get themselves together): from Katniss in The
Hunger Games, to the winners of uncountable reality television
competitions, to games like Day Z and Fallout, to victims of illness or
crime. **[Emotions of anger, suspicion, and defensiveness are
justified]{.underline}**---one can rely only on oneself---**[and
potentially useful as the psychic weapons that can help maintain an
impossible individuality]{.underline}**. [**[The survivor is a
figure]{.mark}** not [for a culture]{.mark} of]{.underline} narcissism
but for a psychotic culture. If narcissistic culture is characterized by
the dislodging [[of symbolic authority]{.mark}, psychotic culture is
[characterized by its foreclosure]{.mark}]{.underline}.26 In brief,
[Lacan defines psychosis in terms of the foreclosure of the
Name-of-the-Father or master signifier[. That the master signifier is
foreclosed means that it does not stabilize meaning; the signifying
chain lacks an anchor that can hold it together]{.mark}. The generalized
loss of symbolic power impacts the subject such that he feels this
now-missing authority to be all the closer, more powerful, and
intrusive]{.underline}. [In a psychotic culture]{.underline}, then,
**[[mistrust is pervasive]{.underline}]{.mark}**, all-consuming.
**[[Each confronts power directly and alone]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [To
compensate for the missing symbolic authority, the psychotic turns to
the imaginary. He positions himself in relation to a "captivating
image," perhaps of one whom he hates, admires, or fears]{.underline}.27
[This imaginary other would then be a rival to defeat or
destroy]{.underline}. [The psychotic may try to mimic those around him,
particularly as he grapples with intense fear and aggression. And he may
also become captivated by an image of himself]{.underline}. Here [the
psychotic imagines himself not as anyone or anything in particular: I am
my]{.underline} [own worst enemy. [What matters is **persistence,
survival, for its own sake**]{.mark}. [Whether rendered as **caring for
oneself**]{.mark} or looking out for number one, [the]{.mark}
captivating [image of the individual **enjoins its own
maintenance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For [all]{.mark} their]{.underline}
emphases on [self-reliance]{.underline}, Silva's
[interviewees]{.underline} nonetheless [**[want to be
recognized]{.underline}**. **[They want someone else to hear their
stories]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, [validate what they've
accomplished]{.mark}. Communicative capitalism supplies the necessary
infrastructure, the crowd of many who might view, like, or
share]{.underline}**. Lasch's diagnosis of cultural narcissism has lost
its currency: [communicative capitalist society is less narcissistic
than it is psychotic, oriented via an alliance of the imaginary and the
Real in the wake of the loss of the symbolic]{.underline}. Rather than
enduring a surfeit of expertise, [we are awash in multiple, conflicting,
irreconcilable opinions]{.underline}. Unable ever fully to determine
which is right, we have to decide for ourselves. [Algorithms and data
render social science obsolete]{.underline}. [[Power is]{.mark} backed
by neither authority nor knowledge, [appearing and manifesting instead
as violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Therapy offers neither justice nor
cure. **Militarized policing---arrests and shootings without
accountability or cause**---takes the place of the former]{.mark}; a
wide array of pharmaceuticals takes the place of the latter, and [when
these fail there is depression]{.mark}, [incapacity]{.mark}, addiction,
and suicide]{.underline}. Finally, precarity, competition, and social
networks supplant the antagonistic cooperation Lasch associates with the
internal life of the corporation. [Aggressive impulses need not be
repressed under a veneer of cheerfulness]{.underline}. In the extreme
inequality of communicative capitalism, [multiple channels encourage
their expression: [hate and outrage circulate easily in affective
networks]{.mark}.]{.underline}28 Nevertheless, Lasch's attention to the
forces that simultaneously command and undermine individuality remains
compelling for the way it opens up the growing weight placed on the
individual form. As subsequent sociological research attests, **[[the
interiorization of this weight continues to unburden corporations and
the state from social responsibilities, intensifying concentration on
already stressed individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[An effect has
been the diminishing of expectations such that [survival itself becomes
the achievement worth celebrating]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Recently, there has been a turn away from textualist and culturalist
theory in feminism and the emergence of \"new\" materialist feminisms.
Represented by the work of Elizabeth Grosz, Rosi Braidotti, and others,
[[this]{.mark} turn in [theory]{.mark} has come in response to the
deepening inequalities and crises of capitalism that are having profound
effects on women worldwide]{.underline} --- material problems outside
the text and not resolvable by a change in cultural values. While it is
important to see that the new materialist feminisms are responses to
real problems[, it is equally important to understand how these
materialisms are limited by their conceptualization of the material. The
new materialist feminisms are actually disenabling for feminism in that
they are forms of spiritualism which [displace critique with strategies
of]{.mark} enchanted [affective adaptation and survival and]{.mark} thus
[dismantle]{.mark} materialist feminism\'s primary conceptual tool for
[social transformation. To avoid merely reproducing]{.mark}
sophisticated forms of the [survivalism]{.mark} and \"prepperism\" that
have emerged [as individualistic coping responses to]{.mark} economic
crisis and [austerity]{.mark}, I argue that feminism [needs]{.mark} to
return to [historical materialism]{.mark} in the tradition of Marx,
Engels and Kollontai [to understand social life in terms of]{.mark} its
[root relations and aid]{.mark} in the [struggles to bring]{.mark} about
[social transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Exemplary of the new
materialist feminism is Rosi Braidotti\'s writing on \"the politics of
\'life itself\',\" a theory which she organizes around the trope of
\"sustainability.\" Sustainability, a concept in ecology for living
within natural limits, becomes in these writings a means of reconceiving
the historical social relations of capitalism as if they were the
unchangeable, underlying existential limit-situation of \"life itself.\"
[The politics of \"life itself\" and the new materialist focus on
seeking a sustainable feminism within this new, more \"realist\"
approach to material reality, is a form of feminist theory and politics
which is ultimately the already familiar theory and politics of
reparative reading.]{.underline} Why is this significant? As Ellis
Hanson suggests in a review of Sedgwick, \"Faced with the depressing
realization that people are fragile and the world hostile, a reparative
reading focuses not on the exposure of political outrages that we
already know but rather on the process of reconstructing a sustainable
life in their wake\" (105). In other words, [[reparative analysis begins
not with critique of the]{.mark} so-called [already known and
presumably]{.mark} known to be [unchangeable, but]{.mark} by focusing on
[how to live within the]{.mark} already-known-to-be [hostile world. Such
a theory]{.mark} of the social [begins and ends by reducing knowledge to
a matter of]{.mark} how to cope, how to feel, [how to exist,]{.mark}
etc. [within what is taken to be unchangeable. The effect]{.mark} of
this focus on \"sustainability\" within hostility [is that]{.mark}
social [transformation]{.mark} --- which requires the production of
knowledge of what needs to be transformed --- [is treated as
impossible]{.mark}. Abandoning [the project]{.mark} of transformation, I
argue, is a sign of the way dominant \"materialist\" feminism --- under
the guise of \"new materialism\"--- [has]{.mark} increasingly
[abandoned]{.mark} the project of women\'s [emancipation from
exploitation, and]{.mark} in the interests of capital instead
[translates austerity]{.mark} measures [into a]{.mark} theoretical
[discourse of getting by on less.]{.mark}]{.underline}

clarifying comes from Cedric Johnson in a piece entitled, "An Open
Letter To Ta-Nehisi Coates And The Liberals Who Love Him." Johnson's
essay offers those of us interested in the problem of white supremacy
and the question of economic class the chance to tease out how, and
where, these two problems intersect. [In Johnson's
rendition]{.underline}, [racism]{.underline}, in and of itself, [holds
limited explanatory power when looking at the socio-economic problems
which beset African Americans]{.underline}. "We continue to reach for
old modes of analysis in the face of a changed world," writes Johnson.
"One where blackness is still derogated but anti-black racism is not the
principal determinant of material conditions and economic mobility for
many African Americans." [Johnson goes on to classify racism among
other]{.underline} varieties of [-isms whose primary purpose is "to
advance exploitation on terms]{.underline} that are most [favorable to
investor class interests]{.underline}." From this perspective, the
absence of specific anti-racist solutions from Bernie Sanders, as well
as his rejection of reparations, make sense. [By Johnson's lights,
**racism is a secondary concern**]{.underline}, and to the extent that
it is a concern at all, it is weapon **[deployed to advance the interest
of a plutocratic minority]{.underline}**. At various points in my life,
I have subscribed to some version of Johnson's argument. I did not
always believe in reparations. In the past, I generally thought that the
problem of white supremacy could be dealt through the sort of broad
economic policy favored by Johnson and his candidate of choice. But
eventually, I came to believe that white supremacy was a force in and of
itself, a vector often intersecting with class, but also operating
independent of it. Nevertheless, my basic feelings about the kind of
America in which I want to live have not changed. [I think [a world with
equal access to]{.mark}]{.underline} safe,
[[quality]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [affordable
[education]{.mark}]{.underline}; [with the right to [health
care]{.mark}]{.underline}; [with strong [restrictions
on]{.mark}]{.underline} massive [[wealth
accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}; [with guaranteed
childcare]{.underline}; [and with access to]{.underline} the full gamut
of [birth-control]{.underline}, including abortion, [[is a better
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[But]{.mark} [I do not believe that if
this world were realized]{.mark}, the problem of [white supremacy would
dissipate]{.mark}]{.underline}**, anymore than I believe that if
reparations were realized, the problems of economic inequality would
dissipate. In either case, **[the notion that one solution is the answer
to the other problem]{.underline}** is not serious policy. It **[is a
palliative]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, palliatives are common these
days among many of us on the left. In a recent piece, I asserted that
western Europe demonstrated that democratic-socialist policy, alone,
could not sufficiently address the problem of white supremacy. Johnson
strongly disagreed with this: Coates's sweeping mischaracterization
diminishes the actual impact that social-democratic and socialist
governments have historically had in improving the labor conditions and
daily lives of working people, in Europe, the United States, and for a
time, across parts of the Third World. There is not a single word in
this response relating to race and racism in Western Europe or anything
remotely closely to it. Instead, Johnson proposes to bait with race, and
then switch to class. He swaps "labor conditions and daily lives of
working people" in for "victims of white supremacy" and prays that the
reader does not notice. Indeed, one might just as easily note that the
advance of indoor plumbing, germ theory, and electricity have improved
"the labor conditions and daily lives of working people," and this would
be no closer to actual engagement. This pattern---strident rhetoric
divorced from knowable fact---marks Johnson's argument. Reparations, he
tells us, do not emerge from the "felt needs of the majority of blacks,"
a claim that is hard to square with the fact that a majority of blacks
support reparations. Instead, he argues, the claim for reparations
emerges from a cabal of "anti-racist liberals" and "black elites"
seeking to make a "territorial-identitarian claim for power." In fact,
the reparations movement runs the gamut from the victims of Jon Burge,
to those targeted by North Carolina's eugenics campaign, to those
targeted by the same campaign in Virginia, to those targeted by "Massive
Resistance" in the same state, to the descendants of those devastated by
the Tulsa pogrom. Are the black people of Tulsa who suffered aerial
bombing at the hands of their own government "black elites" in pursuit
of "territorial-identitarian claim?" Or are they something far
simpler---people who were robbed and believe they deserve to be
compensated? Johnson denigrates recompense by asserting that the demands
for reparations have not "yielded one tangible improvement in the lives
of the majority of African Americans." This is also true of single-payer
health care, calls to break up big banks, free public universities, and
any other leftist policy that has yet to come to pass. For a program to
have effect, it has to actually be put in effect. Why would reparations
be any different? But ultimately, [Johnson doesn't reject reparations
because he doesn't think they would work, but because **he doesn't
believe specific black injury through racism actually
exists**]{.underline}. [He favors a "more Marxist class-oriented
analysis" over the notion of treating "black poverty as fundamentally
distinct from white poverty]{.underline}." Johnson declines to actually
investigate this position and furnish evidence---even though such
evidence is not really hard to find. Courtesy of Emily Badger, this is a
chart of concentrated poverty in America---that is to say families which
are both individually poor and live in poor neighborhoods. [Whereas
individual poverty deprives one of the ability to furnish basic
needs]{.underline}, [[concentrated poverty extends
out]{.underline}]{.mark} from the wallet out [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[surrounding institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}---the schools, the
street, the community center, the policing. [[If individual
poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} in America [[is hunger, neighborhood
poverty is a famine]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the chart demonstrates,
**[[the black poor are]{.mark} considerably [more subject to famine than
the white poor]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed, so broad is this
particular famine that its reach extends out to environs that most would
consider well-nourished. As the chart above demonstrates, [neighborhood
poverty threatens both black poor and nonpoor families to such an extent
that [poor white families are less likely to live in poor neighborhoods
than nonpoor black families]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not an
original finding. The sociologist Robert Sampson finds that: ....[racial
differences in neighborhood exposure to poverty are so strong that
**[even high-income blacks are exposed to greater neighborhood poverty
than low-income whites]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [nonpoor
blacks in Chicago live in neighborhoods that are nearly 30 percent in
poverty]{.underline}---traditionally the definition of "concentrated
poverty" areas---[whereas poor whites lives in neighborhoods with 15
percent poverty]{.underline}, about the national average.\* [In its
pervasiveness, concentration, and reach across class lines]{.underline},
**[[black poverty proves]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself **[[to be
"fundamentally distinct" from white poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It
would be much more convenient for everyone on the left if this were not
true]{.underline}---that is to say if neighborhood poverty, if systemic
poverty, menaced all communities equally. [In such a world, one would
only need to craft universalist solutions for universal
problems]{.underline}. **[But we do not live that world]{.underline}**.
We live in this one: This chart by sociologist Patrick Sharkey
quantifies the degree to which neighborhood poverty afflicts black and
white families. Sociologists like Sharkey typically define a
neighborhood with a poverty rate greater than 20 percent as "high
poverty." [The majority of black people in this country]{.underline} (66
percent) [live in high-poverty neighborhoods]{.underline}. [The vast
majority of whites]{.underline} (94 percent) [do not]{.underline}.
**[The effects]{.underline}** of this **[should concern anyone who
believes in a universalist solution]{.underline}** to a particular
affliction. According to Sharkey: [Neighborhood poverty]{.underline}
alone, [accounts for a greater portion of the black-white downward
mobility gap than the effects of parental education]{.underline},
[occupation]{.underline}, [labor force participation, and]{.underline} a
range of other [family characteristics]{.underline} combined.

No student of the history of American housing policy will be shocked by
this. [[Concentrated poverty is **the clear**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
to some extent intentional, **[[result of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[segregationist housing policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** that dominated
America through much of the 20th century. [But the "fundamental
differences" between black]{.underline} communities [and
white]{.underline} communities [do not end with poverty or social
mobility]{.underline}. In the chart above, Sampson plotted the the
incarceration rate in Chicago from the onset imprisonment boom to its
height. As Sampson notes, [[the incarceration rate in the most afflicted
black neighborhood is **40 times worse** than the incarceration rate in
the most afflicted white neighborhood]{.underline}]{.mark}. But more
tellingly for our purposes, [incarceration rates for white neighborhoods
bunch at the lower end]{.underline}, [while incarceration rates for
black neighborhoods bunch at the higher end]{.underline}. [**[There is
no gradation, nor overlap between the two]{.underline}**. **[It is
almost as if]{.underline}**]{.mark}, from the perspective of mass
incarceration, **[[black and white
people]{.underline}]{.mark}**---regardless of neighborhood---**[[inhabit
two "fundamentally distinct" worlds]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
pervasive and distinctive effects of racism are viewable at every level
of education from high school drop-outs (see pages 13-14 of this Pew
report, especially) to Ivy league graduates. [I strongly suspect that if
one were to investigate public-health outcomes]{.underline}, [exposure
to pollution]{.underline}, [quality of public education or any other
vector relating to socio-economic health]{.underline}, **[a similar
pattern would emerge]{.underline}**.

###  Aff Solves -- Performance

#### Performance and affect are uniquely capable of producing a tool of freedom that generates a movement building capacity. Dominant Marxist critiques of economic power that do not equitably address questions of race, gender, and sexuality are not adequate because they leave intact the residual social formations and habits created by these differentiations.

**Chambers-Letson 18** \[Joshua. After the Party: A Manifesto for Queer
of Color Life. NYU Press, 2018.\]

**[[Through performance Simone]{.mark} opened up and [shared an
insurgent sense of freedom]{.mark} with her listener]{.underline}**. She
did this before she even knew that she was doing it. Early in her
career, she was touched and surprised to learn that the radical, young
civil rights activists of the Student Non- Violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) played her records during their meetings: \"My friends
in SNCC told me that when they got started and had their meetings to
discuss strategy---meetings which Often turned into parties
later---there would always be Nina Simone records in whoever\'s house
the meeting was held in.\"14 These albums, like Little Girl Blue (1959)
or Nina at Newport (1960), featured seemingly a-political folk tunes,
jazz standards, and gospel songs. But the students sense d something
insurgent on her records, and they were touched by the sense of freedom
radiating from them: \"All those afternoons when \[her friend\] Lorraine
\[Hansberry\] had been telling me there was a struggle going on which I
had to get involved in, I had been involved anyway.\"15 **[[Performance
was the site of her struggle]{.mark} and if the insurgent sense of
freedom produced in her song lasted only for the time the record played,
the ephemeral [instantiation of something better]{.mark} than this in
her voice [affirmed the validity of the wish]{.mark} for freedom and
More Life.]{.underline}** So the activists in SNCC kept playing her
records as they did the hard work of building a better world for
everyone. **[The title of this project refers to that which comes after
the party: [the moment when the record comes off, and the students move
into the streets]{.mark}]{.underline}** of Selma or Birmingham,
**[[mobilizing the body in performance and protest to articulate their
demands]{.underline}]{.mark}** for black freedom and More Life. But
**[it]{.underline}** also **[refers to what happens when a party comes
undone, when the last of the meetings has taken place, and the movement
has fallen apart It\'s a reference to life that is lived after your
friends and loved ones have died, and it is a gesture to those lingering
moments in the early dawn [when there is nowhere left to go,]{.mark}
though [you and your people are]{.mark} still [trying to find
refuge]{.mark} together.]{.underline}** Throughout this project, I
insist that **[the incompletion experienced in the moment after [the
party\'s fall, though often crushing, can be an invitation to throw a
new party the next night]{.mark}: the party\'s fall is grounds not for
nihilism, but for action and praxis. It is in this sense that the title
also refers to materialist struggles for freedom and sustainable life
that continue to surge in the twenty-first century, de- spite the
collapse of communism, which once seemed]{.underline}** (if only for a
few flickering moments) **[a promising vehicle for collective
emancipation.]{.underline}** **[Given the crimes and failures of
historical communism, communism is an odd thing to call for. By
insisting that communism is not-yet-here and has
never-been-here]{.underline}**, I am **[following José Munoz and Fred
Moten,]{.underline}** as well as C. L. R. James, Raya Dunayevskaya, and
Grace Lee Boggs (Of the Johnson-Forest Tendency), **[who
concluded]{.underline}**, **[in their]{.underline}** midcentury
**[critique of]{.underline}** **[Stalinism]{.underline}**
**[that]{.underline}** **[not only was socialism nowhere present in any
of the revolutionary societies of the day, but that the revolutionary
parties in places like the Soviet Union and Tito\'s Yugoslavia were
instru- ments of fascist domination in which workers remained
subordinate and subject to the cold exploitation (at best) and brutal,
fascist machi- nations (at worst) of \"the bureaucratic-administrative
one-party state.\"]{.underline}**16 **[Still, they did not advocate a
retreat from Marxism, which would cede the world\'s development totally
to the annihilating tendencies of capital- ism. Rather, they
insisted]{.underline}**, as James wrote elsewhere, **[that \"Marxism is
the doctrine which believes that freedom, equality, democracy are today
possible for all]{.underline}** mankind.\" 17 As the capitalist mode of
production drags the world ever closer to the precipice of total
destruction, our survival may rely now upon the realization of
communism\'s promise, whether we call it \"communism,\" or by another
name. 18 **[In place of racial capitalism\'s market-based com- mons of
race, sex, gender, and class stratified, yet formally colorblind
equivalence, [a communism of incommensurability]{.mark} is a sphere of
social relation structured less by the social fictions of possession,
equality, and exchange, than by collective, entangled, and historically
informed practices of sharing out, just redistribution, sustainability,
and being to- gether in difference.]{.underline}** **[This kind of
communism [might take its cues]{.mark} not so much from the failed
political parties of historical communism, as [from the parties the SNCC
activists threw while listening to Simone\'s records or the
performance-rich parties of queer of color nightlife.]{.mark} Not
because these spaces were perfect---they were and are replete with their
own violences---but because they were trying to produce something else,
something we don\'t even have a vision of]{.underline}**. Yet. This book
undertakes a self-consciously heretical deployment of the tradition of
Marxist aesthetic criticism, mobilizing Marxism in an (often uneasy)
alliance with critical race theory, feminist theory, queer theory,
postcolonial theory, and minoritarian performance theory.
**[[Marxism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, here, **[[is a means not to be
mistaken for the end]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Ernst Bloch insisted,
\"**[Marxism in its entirety, even when brought in in its most il-
luminating form and anticipated in its entire realization, is only a
condi- tion for a life in freedom, life in happiness, life in possible
fulfillment, life with content.\" 19 [Marxism cannot produce freedom,
but it labors to]{.mark} [bring]{.mark} about the conditions [from
within]{.mark} which we might finally begin to imagine, sense, or see
[what freedom could be]{.mark} or feel like. [But]{.mark} to pursue this
goal, [Marxism must reconcile]{.mark} with [its]{.mark} own fundamental
[limitations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For Fredric Jameson, following
Lenin, the lesson of system is that, \"one cannot change anything
without changing everything.\" 20 But **[the [dominant Marxist tradition
has long subordinated questions of race, colonization, indigeneity, sex,
gender, and sexuality to the question of class and political
economy]{.mark}---even when this reduction was and is un- sustainable in
the face of the complexity of actually occurring historical
events.]{.underline}** As Cedric Robinson argues, \"**[Western Marxism,
in either of its two variants---critical-humanist or scientific---has
proven insuffciently radical to expose and root out the racialist order
that contaminates its analytic and philosophic applications or to come
to effective terms with the implications of its own class origins. As a
result, [it has been mis- taken for what it is not: a total theory of
liberation]{.mark}. The ensuing errors have sometimes been horrendous,
inducing in their wake dogmas of certainty characterized by
desperation.\"]{.underline}** 21 **[While this]{.underline}** book
**[cannot]{.underline}** pre- tend to **[solve this
problem]{.underline}**, it suggests that the **[[aesthetic is one place
to look for answers and/or experiment]{.mark} with possible
solutions.]{.underline}** **[For as much as Marxism opens up our
understanding of the labor undertaken by performance, Marxism has much
to learn from minoritarian freedom struggles carried out within the
domain of performance.]{.underline}**

#### Neolib good and Sustainable -- empirics prove

Extremes," May 23, 2017, *Bloomberg*,

["Neoliberalism" isn't the most well-defined of terms]{.underline}. [It
loosely refers to free-market economic ideas, combined with a
technocratic, incrementalist approach to fixing market failures and
redistributing wealth]{.underline}. Many criticize the term for being
too vague, but it's slowly catching on: [Neoliberalism is]{.underline}
essentially [the centrist economic framework embraced by]{.underline}
U.S. presidents like Bill [Clinton]{.underline}, George W. [Bush
and]{.underline} Barack [Obama]{.underline}. [It's also the
paradigm]{.underline} that [most academic economists implicitly
use]{.underline} to think about policy \-- they see themselves as
advisers offering smart, often subtle advice to generally benevolent
policy makers. In other words, neoliberalism is the model the U.S. has
been operating under for decades, and it has had significant influence
abroad as well. [People on the socialist left]{.underline}, especially
in the U.K., [like to blame neoliberal ideology for many of the woes of
the modern world]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [on the right, protectionist
and xenophobic ideas have rapidly replaced free-market
libertarianism]{.underline} as the rallying cry of the Republican base.
The neoliberal center is under assault from both sides. So some internet
jokesters have decided it's time to fight back. The neoliberal memes
poke fun at both the socialist left and the populist right. They proudly
defend taco trucks from Trump's rhetorical assaults and tease
left-leaning politicians like the U.K.'s Jeremy Corbyn and the U.S.'s
Bernie Sanders. And they portray centrist leaders like Germany's Angela
Merkel, France's Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Justin Trudeau not as
embattled apologists for a disintegrating order, but as saviors leading
the strays back to the light: This nascent [pushback is long
overdue]{.underline}. [People in Western countries have been far too
quick to throw centrist technocracy into the dustbin of
history]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} the deep wounds of [the
Great Recession]{.underline} and the 2008 financial crisis, [developed
countries have not seen their economies collapse]{.underline}.
Employment languished for almost a decade, but it's now recovering to
pre-crash levels: Meanwhile, [wages have begun to rise in the U.S. and
are increasing faster]{.underline} for those [at the bottom of the
income distribution]{.underline}. [Home prices and stock markets
have]{.underline} fully [recovered]{.underline} from their recession-era
lows. [There are still plenty of economic problems to be dealt with, but
it's now clear that]{.underline} [advanced economies based on
neoliberalism have not suffered any kind of systemic
collapse]{.underline}**.** Battered and scarred, the system built in the
late 20th century still stands. And [young radicals]{.underline} on
either side of the political divide [should heed the warnings of
history]{.underline}. [The Great Depression]{.underline}, almost a
century ago, [prompted many countries to turn to]{.underline} new and
extreme political and economic philosophies \-- communism, [fascism, or
militarism]{.underline}. In the end, [the country that came
out]{.underline} of that era in [by far the best]{.underline} shape [was
the U.S., whose leader]{.underline}, Franklin D. Roosevelt, [was the
original center-left technocrat]{.underline}. The New Deal has taken a
lot of criticism from hardcore free-marketers in recent decades, but it
was just the compromise the U.S. needed to steer a middle path between
self-destructive extremist ideologies. Many will disagree, but to me FDR
seems like the original

Since the early 1990s, [daily life in poor countries has been changing
profoundly for the better: one billion people]{.underline} have [escaped
extreme poverty]{.underline}, average [incomes have
doubled]{.underline}, infant [death rates have plummeted, millions more
girls]{.underline} have [enrolled in school, chronic hunger has been
cut]{.underline} almost [in half, deaths from]{.underline} malaria and
other [diseases]{.underline} have [declined dramatically, democracy has
spread]{.underline} far and [wide, and the incidence of
war]{.underline}---even with Syria and other conflicts---[has fallen by
half. This unprecedented progress]{.underline} goes way beyond China and
India and [has touched hundreds of millions]{.underline} of people in
dozens of developing countries across [the globe, from Mongolia to
Mozambique, Bangladesh to Brazil]{.underline}. Yet few people are aware
of [these achievements]{.underline}, even though, in aggregate, they
[rank among the most important in human history]{.underline}. In 2013,
the Swedish survey organization Novus Group International asked
Americans how they thought the share of the world's population living in
extreme poverty had changed over the last two decades. Sixty-six percent
of respondents said that they thought it had doubled, and another 29
percent said that it hadn't changed. Only five percent knew (or guessed)
the truth: that [the share of people]{.underline} living [in extreme
poverty had fallen by half]{.underline}. Perhaps that [ignorance
explains why Washington has done so little to take advantage
of]{.underline} these [promising trends, giving only tepid support
to]{.underline} nascent [democracies, making limited investments
in]{.underline} economic [development and]{.underline} in new health and
agricultural technologies, and [failing to take the lead in]{.underline}
building more [effective international institutions]{.underline}.
Whatever the reason, many [developing countries are]{.underline} now
[responding to what they perceive as]{.underline} the United States'
[indifference by looking elsewhere]{.underline}---especially toward
China---for deeper engagement and advice on how to keep growing. At the
same time, [climate change]{.underline}, the [slowdown in]{.underline}
global [growth, and rising tensions in the Middle East]{.underline} and
beyond [have begun to threaten further progress]{.underline}. As a
result, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates now [risks missing
out on a historic chance to strengthen]{.underline} its [global
leadership and]{.underline} help [create a safer]{.underline}, more
[prosperous]{.underline}, and more democratic [world]{.underline}---just
at the moment when it could help the most. ONE GIANT LEAP [Global
poverty is falling faster]{.underline} today [than at any
time]{.underline} in human history. [In 1993]{.underline}, about [two
billion people were]{.underline} trapped [in extreme
poverty]{.underline} (defined by the World Bank as living on less than
\$1.90 per day); [by 2012, that]{.underline} number had [dropped to less
than one billion]{.underline}. The industrialization of China is a big
part of the story, of course, but even excluding that country, the
number of extreme poor has fallen by more than 400 million. Since the
1980s, [more than 60 countries have reduced]{.underline} the number of
their [citizens who are impoverished, even as their]{.underline} overall
[populations have grown]{.underline}. This [decline in poverty has
gone]{.underline} hand in hand [with much faster economic
growth]{.underline}. Between 1977 and 1994, the growth in [per capita
GDP]{.underline} across the developing countries averaged zero; since
1995, that figure has [shot up to three percent]{.underline}. Again, the
change is widespread: between 1977 and 1994, only 21 developing
countries (out of 109 with populations greater than one million)
exceeded two percent annual per capita growth, but between 1995 and
2013, 71 such countries did so. And [going backward has become much less
common]{.underline}: in the earlier period, more than 50 developing
countries recorded negative growth, but in the later one, [just ten
did]{.underline}. The [improvements in health have been even
bigger]{.underline}. In 1960, [22 percent of children]{.underline} in
developing countries [died before their fifth birthday, but by 2013,
only five percent]{.underline} did. Diarrhea killed five million
children a year in 1990 but claimed fewer than one million in 2014.
[Half as many people]{.underline} now [die from malaria]{.underline} as
did in 2000, and [deaths from tuberculosis and AIDS]{.underline} have
both [dropped by a third]{.underline}. The share of [people living with
chronic hunger has fallen by]{.underline} almost [half since the
mid-1990s. Life expectancy at birth]{.underline} in developing countries
[has lengthened by]{.underline} nearly [one-third]{.underline}, from 50
years in 1960 to 65 years today. These [improvements in
health]{.underline} have [left no country untouched]{.underline}, even
the worst-governed ones. Consider this: [the rate of child
death]{.underline} has [declined in every single country]{.underline}
(at least those where data are available) since 1980. Meanwhile, [far
more children are enrolling in]{.underline} and completing
[school]{.underline}. In the late 1980s, only 72 percent of all
primary-school-age children attended school; now, [the figure exceeds 87
percent. Girls]{.underline} in developing countries have [enjoyed the
biggest gains]{.underline}. In 1980, only half of them finished primary
school, whereas four out of five do so today. These leaps in education
are beginning to translate into better-skilled workers. Then there is
the shift to democracy. Prior to the 1980s, most developing countries
were run by left- or right-wing dictators. Coups and countercoups,
violence and assassinations, human rights abuses---all formed part of
regular political life. But starting [in the 1980s, dictators began to
fall]{.underline}, a process that accelerated after the Cold War. In
1983, only 17 of 109 developing countries qualified as
[democracies]{.underline}, based on data from Freedom House and the
Center for Systemic Peace; by 2013, the number [had more than
tripled]{.underline}, to 56 (and that's not counting the many more
developing countries with populations of less than one million). As
those numbers suggest, [power]{.underline} today [is far more likely to
be transferred through]{.underline} the [ballot]{.underline} box
[than]{.underline} through [violence]{.underline}, and elections in most
countries have become fairer and more transparent. Twenty years ago, few
Indonesians could have imagined that a furniture maker from central Java
would beat one of Suharto's relatives in a free and fair election, as
Joko Widodo did in 2014. Nor would many have predicted that Nigeria,
then still under military rule, would in 2015 mark its first peaceful
transfer of power between parties, or that Myanmar (also called Burma)
would hold its most successful democratic election the same year. Across
the developing world, [individual freedoms]{.underline} and rights [are
honored]{.underline} to a much greater degree, [human rights abuses are
rarer]{.underline}, and legislative bodies have more power. [Yes,
many]{.underline} of these new [democracies have problems. And yes, the
march]{.underline} toward democracy [has slowed]{.underline} since
2005---and even reversed in some countries, such as Thailand and
Venezuela. [But in many more]{.underline}---from Brazil to Mongolia to
Senegal---[democracy has deepened. Never]{.underline} before in history
[have so many developing countries been so democratic. As
states]{.underline} have [become]{.underline} wealthier and more
[democratic, conflict and violence]{.underline} within them have
[declined]{.underline}. Those who think otherwise should remember that
as recently as [the 1980s and early 1990s]{.underline}, much of [the
world was aflame, from Central America to]{.underline} Southeast Asia to
[West Africa. There were half as many civil wars in the last
decade]{.underline} as there were in the 1980s, and the [number of
people killed in]{.underline} armed [conflicts has fallen by
three-quarters]{.underline}. Three major forces sparked this great surge
in development progress. First, the end of the Cold War brought an end
to the superpowers' support for some of the world's nastiest dictators
and reduced the frequency of conflict. As ideas about economic and
political governance began to change, [developing countries
introduced]{.underline} more [market-based]{.underline} economic
[systems and]{.underline} more [democracy]{.underline}. Second,
[globalization created vast]{.underline} new opportunities for economic
[growth. Increased flows of]{.underline} trade,
[investment]{.underline}, information, and technology created more jobs
and [improved living standards]{.underline}. Third, new and more
effective leaders---in politics, business, religion, and civil
society---began to forge deep change. Where courageous figures, such as
Nelson Mandela in South Africa, stepped forward, countries progressed;
where old-style dictators, such as Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, remained
in power, countries languished. This [incredibly wide-ranging progress
should not obscure]{.underline} the considerable [work that
remains]{.underline}: progress has not reached everyone, everywhere. One
billion people still live in extreme poverty, six million children die
every year from preventable diseases, too few girls get the education
they deserve, and too many people suffer under dictatorships. Countries
such as Haiti, North Korea, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe lag far behind. But
the fact remains that [an enormous transformation is under
way]{.underline}---one [that has already]{.underline} substantially
[improved]{.underline} the lives of [hundreds of millions of
people]{.underline}. WIN-WIN [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should]{.underline} welcome and [encourage this
progress]{.underline}. For starters, broad-based [development enhances
global security]{.underline}. It is not true that poverty necessarily
breeds terrorism, as some argue---after all, most poor people are not
terrorists, and many terrorists are not poor. But it is true that [poor
states tend to be]{.underline} weak states [unable to prevent terrorist
and criminal networks]{.underline} from operating on their soil.
[Sustained development strengthens]{.underline} government [institutions
and reduces]{.underline} the need for outside
[intervention]{.underline}. As former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert
Gates put it, "Development is a lot cheaper than sending soldiers."
[Development]{.underline} also [builds]{.underline} states' [capacities
to fight pandemic]{.underline} disease. [Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra
Leone were overwhelmed by Ebola]{.underline} in 2014 largely because
they all had weak health systems. The same was true in many of the
countries hit hardest by the HIV/AIDS epidemic decades ago. [As poor
countries grow wealthier]{.underline}, however, [they become better
equipped to fight diseases]{.underline} that can spread quickly beyond
their borders. A more prosperous developing world also benefits the U.S.
economy. The spread of economic [growth creates new markets]{.underline}
for American businesses not just in China but also [in Brazil,
Indonesia, South Africa, and beyond]{.underline}. Developing countries
are buying more and more aircraft, automobiles, semiconductors, medical
equipment, pharmaceuticals, consultancy services, and entertainment.
Although the growth in trade with developing countries has slowed during
the last year, their economies will no doubt remain major market
opportunities for U.S. companies. In 1990, [such states accounted
for]{.underline} one-third of the global economy; today, their share is
[half]{.underline}, and they purchase more than half [of]{.underline}
U.S. [exports]{.underline}. In 2011, Walmart spent \$2.4 billion to
acquire a controlling share of a holding company that operates more than
350 retail stores in South Africa and 11 other African countries,
signaling a level of interest in African consumers that would have been
unimaginable two decades ago. To be sure, emerging markets also create
competition for U.S. businesses and hardship for American workers who
lose their jobs as a result. But they also create many new jobs, as
American firms expand abroad and as companies in the developing world
send more capital to the West. Moreover, [developing countries are
increasingly coming up with]{.underline} their own [innovations and
technologies, in medicine, agriculture, energy]{.underline}, and more.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should
respond]{.underline} to this growing competition not with protectionism
but [by strengthening its]{.underline} own [capacities:
rebuilding]{.underline} its [infrastructure, improving]{.underline} its
[educational]{.underline} system, [and investing in]{.underline} new
[technologies]{.underline}. Finally, [development helps]{.underline}
spread and [deepen]{.underline} the values that Americans hold dear:
openness, economic opportunity, democracy, and freedom. These values
tend to go hand in hand with growing [prosperity]{.underline}: as
incomes rise, citizens demand greater freedoms. History suggests that
even governments that do not welcome these ideas eventually embrace them
or are replaced by those that do. And as more developing countries
achieve progress under market-based economic systems and democracy,
[other countries seek to emulate the model. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and Europe have a strong self-interest in
encouraging this process, since it [will enhance global
stability]{.underline} and add to the number of like-minded partners
that can help address future challenges. SUSTAINING THE SURGE What makes
all [this progress]{.underline} especially impressive is that it [has
continued despite]{.underline} a number of [major shocks]{.underline}
that in an earlier age could well have stopped it: [the outbreak of the
HIV]{.underline}/AIDS pandemic in the 1980s, [the Asian financial
crisis]{.underline} in 1997--98, the [9/11]{.underline} attacks, [the
global food crisis]{.underline} of 2007--8, [and]{.underline} the global
financial crisis of [2008]{.underline}. In each case, pundits predicted
that the disaster of the day would set back progress. Yet in each case,
the [gains]{.underline} continued. There are good reasons to believe
they [can continue well into the future]{.underline}. The [forces that
sparked]{.underline} these [changes were fundamental, not transitory.
Governments have]{.underline} learned from their mistakes and [gotten
much better at managing inevitable downturns. Global integration has
made critical technologies available]{.underline} to more and more
people. [State institutions have become]{.underline} more
[effective]{.underline}, with improved (if imperfect) legal systems,
clearer property rights, and greater respect for individual liberties.
[Democratic rules]{.underline} and norms governing the transfer of
political power, free speech, and accountability [have become more
deeply entrenched]{.underline}. Civil society groups are more active.
These deep-seated changes have put enormous additional gains well within
reach. [If economic growth proceeds along]{.underline} the lines of most
[projections]{.underline} over the next two decades, some [700 million
more people will escape extreme poverty. Per capita incomes]{.underline}
in poor countries [will double again, millions of]{.underline} childhood
[deaths will be avoided, tens of millions]{.underline} of children [will
get]{.underline} the [education]{.underline} they deserve, [hunger will
decline]{.underline}, and basic rights and freedoms will spread further.
At least, that's what should happen---[but none of these]{.underline}
future [gains is guaranteed. Growth has slowed]{.underline} markedly
[since 2008]{.underline} in emerging economies such as Brazil and China
and throughout the developing world. [Russia, Thailand, and Venezuela
have turned less democratic]{.underline}, and South Africa and Turkey
seem to be headed in that direction as well. [The Middle East has
seen]{.underline} the return of conflict and [authoritarian rule.
China's aggressive actions]{.underline} in the South China Sea [could
spark a major conflict]{.underline} that could kill tens of thousands of
people and devastate the region's economies. Outbreaks of SARS and the
H1N1 and Ebola viruses underscore humanity's vulnerability to disease,
and many doctors worry that growing resistance to antibiotics could
reverse some of the hard-fought gains in health. Meanwhile, global
population is on track to exceed nine billion by 2050, and [the
combination of]{.underline} more [people, higher incomes,
and]{.underline} warmer [climates will place enormous strains
on]{.underline} the [world's supplies]{.underline} of fresh water, food,
and energy. Although there are ample grounds for pessimism, the
[doomsayers]{.underline} continue to [underestimate humanity's growing
ability]{.underline} to cooperate [in the face of new
challenges]{.underline}. In the eighteenth century, when Thomas
[Malthus]{.underline} looked at population growth and foresaw
catastrophic famine, he [failed to appreciate the advances in
ag]{.underline}riculture, [health, and governance]{.underline} that
human ingenuity could create. The same was true for those that predicted
a population disaster in Asia in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the
problems facing developing countries are plain to see, while the new
ideas and innovations that will overcome them are harder to picture.
[Continued progress isn't]{.underline} automatic or [guaranteed.
But]{.underline} with smart choices, [it is within reach]{.underline}.
LEADING BY EXAMPLE Most of the key choices will be made in developing
countries themselves. Sustaining progress will require leaders there to
reduce their countries' dependence on natural resources, make their
economies more inclusive, invest more in health and education, expand
opportunities for women, and strengthen democracy and the rule of law.
Yet [the future of development will]{.underline} also [depend on
the]{.underline} actions of the [world's leading countries]{.underline},
since [poorer countries can prosper only in a strong]{.underline} global
[system. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must]{.underline}
do its part by [regain]{.underline}ing i[ts economic leadership
through]{.underline} major investments in [infrastructure, education,
and technological advances]{.underline} in health, agriculture, and
alternative fuels. It must act to fix its long-term budget problems by
improving the solvency of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and
strengthen the financial system through better regulation. [The country
must]{.underline} also do a much better job of [lead]{.underline}ing [by
example on democracy]{.underline}. Deep political polarization, the lack
of substantive debate, the unwillingness to compromise, misguided
foreign policy adventurism, and the Great Recession have made liberal
democracy look unattractive and ineffective. That malaise matters,
because many [developing countries are]{.underline} now [engaged in a
battle of ideas over which economic and political model]{.underline}
they should follow. [On the one side stands the model that has
prevailed]{.underline} in the West since World War II: [market
capitalism coupled with liberal democracy. On the other is]{.underline}
the model practiced by China, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and, increasingly,
Russia, among others: [state]{.underline} capitalism coupled with
[authoritarian rule]{.underline}. And there's yet one more option, with
a smaller but more dangerous following: religious fundamentalism, as
promulgated by Iran and Saudi Arabia and groups such as the Islamic
State (or ISIS) and Boko Haram in Nigeria. [As the Western countries
struggle]{.underline} and China continues to rise, [authoritarian
capitalism is becomin]{.underline}g more [appealing]{.underline}.
Consider Beijing's ties to Africa. China purchased \$26 billion in
imports from the continent in 2013; the United States purchased \$9
billion. Chinese investment in Africa has been growing by 50 percent per
year since 2000, whereas U.S. investment is growing by 14 percent per
year. [Make no mistake]{.underline}: many [Africans still
prefer]{.underline} to follow [the American model and view China with
suspicion. But]{.underline} those [attitudes are beginning to
shift]{.underline}, and Beijing's apparent ability to get things done
will only enhance China's appeal, especially if Washington seems to talk
big but deliver little. THE NEXT SURGE FORWARD Aside from the broader
task of getting their own houses in order, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and other Western powers [should]{.underline} also
[assert leadership]{.underline} in several specific areas [to keep the
progress going]{.underline}. The first is climate change, which presents
one of the greatest threats to poverty reduction. Most of the world's
poor countries had little to do with creating the problem, yet they will
bear the brunt of the damage. Rising sea levels, changing rainfall
patterns, higher temperatures, and dwindling water supplies will derail
progress, will undermine global food production, and could engender
major conflict. Developing countries have an important role to play in
curbing emissions, but they will not switch to low-carbon fuels and
other clean technologies if their developed-world counterparts do not.
Washington has taken important first steps to reduce power-plant
emissions and raise automotive fuel-efficiency standards, but there is a
very long way to go. Second, [leading
countries]{.underline}---especially the United States---[should invest
more in technological innovation]{.underline}. Much of the credit for
recent improvements in living standards goes to vaccines, medicines,
high-yielding seed varieties, cell phones, and the Internet. These [new
technologies]{.underline} (alongside old ones such as electricity and
paved roads) [have not yet reached everywhere, so]{.underline} simply
[making them]{.underline} more [widely available would do
wonders]{.underline}. But [sustaining progress for]{.underline} the next
several [decades will]{.underline} also [require significant
investments]{.underline} in new vaccines, more powerful drugs, drought-
and heat-resistant seeds, desalination techniques, and clean energy.

### Class Focus Bad

#### [Alt alone leads to racial suppression -- their theorization of class identity as magically unifying ignores psychic volence and is just a bunch of white people yelling Ross, 2000 Assc. Director of the Center for AfroAmerican and African Studies @ U Mich 2000 ]{.mark} [Marlon-Professor of English; Pleasuring Identity, or the Delicious Politics of Belonging; NEW LITERARY HISTORY, Vol. 31, No. 4, Is There Life after Identity Politics?; Autumn, 2000; pp.827-850.]{.mark}

Although in his contribution Eric Lott targets Professor Michaels's
comments and his own recent feud with Timothy Brennan (who unfortunately
is not included in this volume) rather than Ken's argument, what Eric
says about "left and liberal fundamentalists" who "simply and somewhat
penitently" urge us to "'go back to class'" could also be directed at
Ken's conclusion. Ken writes, "Crafting a political left that does not
merely reflect existing racial divisions starts with the relatively
mundane proposition that it is possible to make a persuasive appeal to
the given interests of working and unemployed women and men, regardless
of race, in support of a program for economic justice." On this one, I
side with Eric, rather than Tim and Ken[. Standing on the left depends
on whose left side we're talking about. My left might be your right and
vice versa, because it depends on what direction we're facing, and what
direction depends on which identities we're assuming and
affirmin]{.underline}g. Eric adds, "Even in less dismissive \[than
Tim's\] accounts of [new social movements based not on class but on
identities formed by histories of injustice, there is a striking a
priori sense of voluntarism about the investment in this cause or that
movement or the other issue]{.underline}---as though determining the
most fundamental issue were a matter of the writer's strength of feeling
rather than a studied or analytical sense of the ever-unstable balance
of forces in a hegemonic bloc at a given moment." I agree, but I'll risk
mangling what Eric says by putting it more crassly. [**[Touting class or
"economic justice" as the fundamental stance for left identity is just
another way of telling everybody else to shut up so I can be heard above
the fray]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Because of the force of "identity
politics," a [leftist white person would be leery of claiming to lead
Blacks toward the promised land, a leftist straight man leery of
claiming to lead women or queers,]{.underline} but, for a number of
complex rationalizations, we in the middle class (where all of us
writing here currently reside) still have few qualms about volunteering
to lead, at least theoretically, the working class toward "economic
justice." [What Eric calls here "left fundamentalism," I'd call, at the
risk of sounding harsh, left paternalism. Of the big identity groups
articulated through "identity politics," [economic class]{.mark}
commentary: pleasuring [identity remains the only identity where a
straight white middle-class man can still feel comfortable claiming
himself a leading political voice, and thus he may sometimes
overcompensate by screaming that this is the only identity that really
matters]{.mark}---which is the same as claiming that class is beyond
identity.]{.underline} Partly this is because [[Marxist theory]{.mark}
and Marx himself]{.underline} (a bourgeois intellectual creating the
theoretical practice for the workers' revolution) [[stage]{.mark} [the
model for working-class identity as]{.mark} a sort of
[trans-identification, a magical identity that is transferable to those
outside the group who commit themselves to it wholeheartedly
enough]{.mark}]{.underline}. If we look back[, we realize even this
magical quality is not special to a history of class
struggle]{.underline}, [as whites during the New Negro movements of the
early twentieth century felt that they were vanguard race leaders
because they had putatively imbibed some essential qualities of
Negroness by cross-identifying with the folk and their
culture]{.underline}. Ironically, Ken's conclusion is full of the very
identity concepts that he hopes to transcend by an appeal to a broadly
conceived "political left." [As I have already suggested, "[the left" is
an identity formation no less than race or gender or
sexuality]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Consider the other key terms of
Ken's manifesto: "working and unemployed," "men and women," "given
interests." As Professor Michaels indicates, "[[interests" are always
implicated in identity because they concern the negotiation of subject
positions]{.mark}. Ken's recourse to "men and women," instead of simply
"people" or some other less gendered term, indicates to what extent what
he's referring to is an alliance or coalition.]{.underline} Rather than
ushering in a post-identity world of pure common interests, Ken's
manifesto looks back to the prehistory of "identity politics," that
Edenic moment before we fell into proliferating identities on the left.
[What is it that we bring together in coalitions if not "men" and
"women," with the identifiable interests that generally bring them to a
common place across their differing identity circumstances? **[What are
the "working" and "unemployed" if not class-based identity
formations?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

###  Extinction K -- Setcol

#### Extinction is the master settler trope. Invoking the settler trope of \'extinction\' enables settler moves to innocence

**Dalley, 16 (**Hamish "The deaths of settler colonialism: extinction as
a metaphor of decolonization in contemporary settler literature,"
Settler Colonial Studies
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2201473X.2016.1238160> JM

**[[Settlers love to contemplate the possibility of their own
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**; to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come. This tendency is widely
prevalent in English-language representations of settler colonialism
produced since the 1980s: the possibility of an ending -- the likelihood
that the settler race will one day die out -- is a common theme in
literary and pop culture considerations of colonialism's future. Yet it
has barely been remarked how surprising it is that this theme is so
present. [**For settlers,**]{.underline} of all people[, **to
obsessively ruminate on their own finitude is counterintuitive, for few
modern social formations have been more resistant to change than settler
colonialism.**]{.underline} With a few exceptions (French Algeria being
the largest), the settler societies established in the last 300 years in
the Americas, Australasia, and Southern Africa have all retained the
basic features that define them as settler states -- namely, the
structural privileging of settlers at the expense of indigenous peoples,
and the normalization of whiteness as the marker of political agency and
rights -- and they have done so notwithstanding the sustained resistance
trading as that has been mounted whenever such an order has been built.
Settlers think all the time that they might one day end, even though
(perhaps because) that ending seems unlikely ever to happen. The
significance of this paradox for settler-colonial literature is the
subject of this article. Considering the problem of [**futurity offers a
useful foil to traditional analyses of settler colonial narrative, which
typically examine settlers' attitudes towards history in order to
highlight a constitutive anxiety about the past**]{.underline} -- about
origins. Settler colonialism, the argument goes, has a problem with
historical narration that arises from a contradiction in its founding
mythology. In Stephen Turner's formulation, the settler subject is by
definition one who comes from elsewhere but who strives to make this
place home. The settlement narrative must explain how this gap -- which
is at once geographical, historical, and existential -- has been
bridged, and the settler transformed from outsider into indigene. Yet
the transformation must remain constitutively incomplete, because the
desire to be at home necessarily invokes the spectre of the native,
whose existence (which cannot be disavowed completely because it is
needed to define the settler's difference, superiority, and hence claim
to the land) inscribes the settler's foreignness, thus reinstating the
gap between settler and colony that the narrative was meant to efface.1
Settler-colonial narrative is thus shaped around its need to erase and
evoke the native, to make the indigene both invisible and present in a
contradictory pattern that prevents settlers from ever moving on from
the moment of colonization.2 As evidence of this constitutive
contradiction, critics have identified in settler-colonial discourse
symptoms of psychic distress such as disavowal, inversion, and
repression.3 Indeed, [**[the frozen temporality of settler-colonial
narrative, fixated on the moment of the frontier, recalls nothing so
much as]{.mark}**]{.underline} Freud's description of the
'**[[repetition compulsion' attending trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**.4 As
Lorenzo Veracini puts it[, **[because: 'settler society' can thus be
seen as a fantasy where a perception of a constant struggle is
juxtaposed against an ideal of 'peace' that can never be reached,
settler projects embrace and reject violence at the same
time]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The settler colonial situation is thus a
circumstance where the tension between contradictory impulses produces
long-lasting psychic conflicts and a number of associated
psychopathologies.5 Current scholarship has thus focused primarily on
settler-colonial narrative's view of the past, asking how such a
contradictory and troubled relationship to history might affect
present-day ideological formations. Critics have rarely considered what
such narratological tensions might produce when the settler gaze is
turned to the future. [**[Few social formations are
more]{.mark}**]{.underline} stubbornly [**[resistant to change than
settlement, suggesting that a future beyond settler colonialism might
be]{.mark}**]{.underline} simply [**[unthinkable]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Veracini, indeed, suggests that settler-colonial narrative can never
contemplate an ending: that settler decolonization is inconceivable
because settlers lack the metaphorical tools to imagine their own
demise.6 This article outlines why I partly disagree with that view. I
argue that the narratological paradox that defines settler-colonial
narrative does make the future a problematic object of contemplation.
But that does not make settler decolonization unthinkable per se; as I
will show, [**[settlers]{.mark}**]{.underline} do often try to
[**[imagine their demise]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- but they do so [**[in
a way that reasserts the paradoxes of their founding
ideology]{.mark}**,]{.underline} with the result that the radical
potentiality of decolonization is undone even as it is invoked. I argue
that, notwithstanding Veracini's analysis, there is a metaphor via which
the end of settler colonialism unspools -- [**[the quasi-biological
concept of extinction,]{.mark} which, when deployed as a narrative
trope, [offers settlers a chance to consider and disavow their demise,
just as they consider and then disavow the violence of their
origins]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This article traces the importance of
the trope of extinction for contemporary settler-colonial literature,
with a focus on South Africa, Canada, and Australia. It explores
variations in how the death of settler colonialism is conceptualized,
drawing a distinction between historio-civilizational narratives of the
rise and fall of empires, and a species-oriented notion of extinction
that draws force from public anxiety about climate change -- an
invocation that adds another level of ambivalence by drawing on
'rational' fears for the future (because climate change may well render
the planet uninhabitable to humans) in order to narrativize a form of
social death that, strictly speaking, belongs to a different order of
knowledge altogether. As such, my analysis is intended to draw the
attention of settlercolonial studies toward futurity and the ambivalence
of settler paranoia, while highlighting a potential point of
cross-fertilization between settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches
to contemporary literature. **[That 'extinction' should be a key word in
the settler-colonial lexicon is no surprise.]{.underline}** In Patrick
Wolfe's phrase,7 **[settler colonialism is predicated on a 'logic of
elimination' that tends towards the extermination -- by one means or
another -- of indigenous peoples]{.underline}.**8 This logic is apparent
in archetypal settler narratives like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last
of the Mohicans (1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the
melancholia and triumph that demarcate settlers' affective responses to
the supposed inevitability of indigenous extinction. Concepts like
'stadial development' -- by which societies progress through stages,
progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and 'fatal impact' --
which names the biological inevitability of strong peoples supplanting
weak -- all contribute to the notion that **[[settler colonialism is a
kind of 'ecological process' 9 that necessitates the extinction of
inferior races.]{.underline}]{.mark} [What is surprising, though, is how
often the trope of extinction also appears with reference to settlers
themselves; it makes sense for settlers to narrate how their presence
entails others' destruction, but [it is less clear why their attempts to
imagine futures should presume extinction to be their own logical end as
well]{.mark}]{.underline}**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark} The idea appears
repeatedly in English-language literary treatments of settler
colonialism. Consider, for instance, the following rumination on the
future of South African settler society, from Olive Schreiner's 1883
Story of an African Farm: It was one of them, one of those wild old
Bushmen, that painted those pictures there. He did not know why he
painted but he wanted to make something, so he made these. \[...\] Now
the Boers have shot them all, so that we never see a yellow face peeping
out among the stones. \[...\] And the wild bucks have gone, and those
days, and we are here. But we will be gone soon, and only the stones
will lie on, looking at everything like they look now.10 In this
example, the narrating settler character, Waldo, recognizes prior
indigenous inhabitation but his knowledge comes freighted with an
expected sense of biological superiority, made apparent by his
description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow face', and lack of mental
self-awareness. What is not clear is why Waldo's contemplation of
colonial genocide should turn immediately to the assumption that a
similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar presumption of racial
vulnerability permeates other late nineteenthcentury novels from the
imperial metropole, such as Dracula and War of the Worlds, SETTLER
COLONIAL STUDIES 3 which are plotted around the prospect of invasions
that would see the extinction of British imperialism, and, in the
process, the human species. Such anxieties draw energy from a pattern of
settler defensiveness that can be observed across numerous
settler-colonial contexts. Marilyn Lake's and Henry Reynold's account of
the emergence of transnational 'whiteness' highlights the paradoxical
fact that while white male settlers have been arguably the most
privileged class in history, they have routinely perceived themselves to
be 'under siege', threatened with destruction to the extent that their
very identity of 'whiteness was born in the apprehension of imminent
loss'. 11 [**[The fear of looming annihilation serves a powerful
ideological function in settler communities, working to foster racial
solidarity, suppress dissent, and legitimate violence against indigenous
populations]{.mark}**]{.underline} who, by any objective measure, are
far more at risk of extermination than the settlers who fear them. Ann
Curthoys and Dirk Moses have traced this pattern in Australia and
Israel-Palestine, respectively.12 This scholarship suggests that
**[[narratives of settler extinction are acts of ideological
mystification, obscuring the brutal inequalities of the frontier behind
a mask of white vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- an argument with
which I sympathize. However, this article shows how there is more to
settler-colonial extinction narratives than bad faith. I argue that
[**[we need a]{.mark} [more]{.mark} [nuanced understanding
of]{.mark}**]{.underline} how they encode a specifically
[**[settler-colonial]{.mark}**]{.underline} framework for imagining the
[[**future**,]{.mark}]{.underline} one that has implications for how we
understand contemporary literatures from settler societies, and which
allows us to see extinction as a genuine, if flawed, attempt to envisage
social change. In the remainder of this paper I consider extinction's
function as a metaphor of decolonization. I use this phrase to invoke,
without completely endorsing, Tuck and Yang's argument that to treat
decolonization figuratively, as I argue extinction narratives do, is
necessarily to preclude radical change, creating opportunities for
settler 'moves to innocence' that re-legitimate racial inequality.13 The
counterview to this pessimistic perspective is offered by Veracini, who
suggests that progressive change to settler-colonial relationships will
only happen if narratives can be found that make decolonization
thinkable.14 This article enters the debate between these two
perspectives by asking what it means for settler writers to imagine the
future via the trope of extinction. Does extinction offer a meaningful
way to think about ending settler colonialism, or does it re-activate
settler-colonial patterns of thought that allow exclusionary social
structures to persist? I explore this question with reference to
examples of contemporary literary treatments of extinction from select
English-speaking settler-colonial contexts: South Africa, Australia, and
Canada.15 The next section of this article traces key elements of
extinction narrative in a range of settler-colonial texts, while the
section that follows offers a detailed reading of one of the best
examples of a sustained literary exploration of human finitude, Margaret
Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I advance four specific
arguments. First, extinction narratives take at least two forms
depending on whether the 'end' of settler society is framed primarily in
historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger, biological sense; the
key question is whether the 'thing' that is going extinct is a society
or a species. Second[, [**biologically oriented extinction narratives
rely on a more or less conscious slippage between 'the settler' and 'the
human'**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Third[, **[this slippage is ideologically
ambivalent: on the one hand, it contains a radical charge that invokes
environmentalist discourse and climate-change anxiety to imagine social
forms that re-write settler-colonial dynamics; on the other, it
replicates a core aspect of imperialist ideology by normalizing
whiteness as equivalent to humanity.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Fourth,
these ideological effects are mediated by gender, insofar as extinction
narratives invoke issues of biological reproduction, community
protection, and violence that function to differentiate and reify
masculine and feminine roles in the putative de-colonial future.
Overall, my central claim is that **[[extinction is a core trope through
which settler futurity emerges, one with crucial narrative and
ideological effects that shape much of the contemporary literature
emerging from white colonial settings]{.underline}]{.mark}.**

Inside the Vampires' Castle The first configuration is what I came to
call the Vampires' Castle. **[[The Vampires' Castle]{.mark} specialises
in propagating guilt]{.underline}**. [It [is driven by]{.mark} **a
priest's [desire to]{.mark}**]{.underline} **excommunicate [and
[condemn]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[an academic-pedant's [desire to be
the first]{.mark} to be seen [to]{.mark} [spot]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
[mistake]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and]{.mark} **[a hipster's desire [to
be]{.mark} one [of the in-crowd]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The danger in
attacking [the Vampires' Castle]{.mark} is that **it [can look as
if]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- and **[[it will]{.mark} do everything it
can to [reinforce this thought]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
**[[that]{.mark} one [is also attacking the struggles]{.mark} [against
racism, sexism, heterosexism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[But, far from
being the only legitimate expression of such struggles, [the]{.mark}
[Vampires' Castle is]{.mark} best understood as [a bourgeois-liberal
perversion]{.mark} and appropriation of the energy of these
movements]{.underline}**. [**The Vampires' Castle was [born]{.mark} the
moment [when the struggle]{.mark} not to be defined by identitarian
categories [became the quest]{.mark} [to have 'identities' recognised
by]{.mark} a [bourgeois]{.mark} big Other.** The privilege I certainly
enjoy as a white male consists in part in my not being aware of my
ethnicity and my gender]{.underline}, and [it is a sobering and
revelatory experience to occasionally be made aware of these
blind-spots]{.underline}. [**But, [rather than seeking]{.mark} a world
in which everyone achieves [freedom from identitarian
classification]{.mark}, the Vampires' Castle seeks to corral people back
into identi-camps, where they are forever defined in the terms set by
dominant power, crippled by self-consciousness and isolated by a logic
of solipsism which insists that we cannot understand one another unless
we belong to the same identity group.** I've noticed a fascinating
**magical inversion projection-disavowal mechanism** whereby **[the
sheer mention of class]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} now **automatically
[treated]{.mark} [as if]{.mark} that means [one is trying to downgrade
the importance of race and gender]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[In fact,
the exact opposite is the case, as [the]{.mark} [V]{.mark}ampires'
[C]{.mark}astle [uses]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n ultimately [liberal]{.mark}
[understanding]{.mark} of race and gender [to obfuscate
class]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [In all of the absurd and traumatic
twitterstorms about privilege]{.underline} earlier this year **[it was
noticeable that the discussion of class privilege was entirely
absent]{.underline}**. [The task]{.underline}, as ever, **[remains the
articulation of class, gender and race -- but [the founding move]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [the]{.mark} Vampires' [Castle]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the
[dis-articulation of class from other categories]{.mark}. The problem
that the Vampires' Castle was set up to solve is this: how do you hold
immense wealth and power while also appearing as a victim, marginal and
oppositional?]{.underline}** **[The solution was already there -- in the
Christian Church]{.underline}**. **[So the VC has recourse to all the
infernal strategies, dark pathologies and psychological torture
instruments Christianity invented,]{.underline}** and [which Nietzsche
described in The Genealogy of Morals]{.underline}. **[This priesthood of
bad conscience, this nest of pious guilt-mongers, is exactly what
Nietzsche predicted when he said that something worse than Christianity
was already on the way. Now, here it is ... The [V]{.mark}ampires'
[C]{.mark}astle [feeds on]{.mark} the energy and anxieties and
[vulnerabilities]{.mark} [of]{.mark} young [students]{.mark}, but most
of all it lives [by]{.mark} [converting]{.mark} the [suffering]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [particular]{.mark} groups -- the more 'marginal' the better
-- [into]{.mark} [academic]{.mark} [capital]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[The most lauded figures in the Vampires' Castle are those who have
spotted a new market in suffering]{.underline}** -- **[those who can
find a group more oppressed and subjugated than any previously exploited
will find themselves promoted through the ranks very quickly[. The first
law of the Vampires' Castle is: individualise and privatise
everything]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While **[in theory it claims to be in
favour of structural critique, in practice [it]{.mark} never
[focuses]{.mark} [on]{.mark} anything except [individual]{.mark}
[behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some of these working class types are
not terribly well brought up, and can be very rude at times. Remember:
[condemning individuals is always more important than paying attention
to impersonal structures]{.underline}. The actual ruling class
propagates ideologies of individualism, while tending to act as a class.
(Many of what we call 'conspiracies' are the ruling class showing class
solidarity.) [[The]{.mark} [VC]{.mark}]{.underline}, as dupe-servants of
the ruling class, does the opposite: it **[[pays]{.mark} [lip]{.mark}
[service]{.mark} to 'solidarity' and
'[collectivity']{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} **[[while]{.mark}
always [acting]{.mark} as if the [individualist]{.mark}
[categories]{.mark} imposed by power really
[hold]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Because [they]{.mark} [are]{.mark}
[petit]{.mark}-[bourgeois]{.mark} to the core, the members of the
Vampires' Castle are [intensely]{.mark} [competitive]{.mark}, but this
is repressed in the [passive]{.mark} [aggressive]{.mark} manner typical
of the bourgeoisie]{.underline}**. [What holds them together is not
solidarity, but mutual fear -- the fear that they will be the next one
to be outed, exposed, condemned. **[The]{.mark} [second]{.mark}
[law]{.mark} of the Vampires' Castle [is]{.mark}: [make]{.mark} thought
and [action]{.mark} [appear]{.mark} very, very
[difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[There must be no lightness, and
certainly no humour. Humour isn't serious, by definition,
right]{.underline}**? **[Thought is hard work, for people with posh
voices and furrowed brows]{.underline}**. **[Where there is confidence,
[introduce]{.mark} [scepticism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
**[[Say]{.mark}: don't be hasty, [we]{.mark} [have]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[think]{.mark} more [deeply]{.mark} about this. Remember:
[having]{.mark} [convictions]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [oppressive]{.mark},
and might lead to gulags. [The]{.mark} [third]{.mark} [law]{.mark} of
the Vampires' Castle [is]{.mark}: [propagate]{.mark} as much
[guilt]{.mark} as you can]{.underline}**. **[The more guilt the
better]{.underline}**. **[People must feel bad: it is a sign that they
understand the gravity of things]{.underline}**. [It's OK to be
class-privileged if you feel guilty about privilege and make others in a
subordinate class position to you feel guilty too. You do some good
works for the poor, too, right? The fourth law of the Vampires' Castle
[is]{.mark}: **[essentialize]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[While [fluidity
of identity]{.mark}, pluarity and multiplicity [are]{.mark} always
[claimed on behalf of the VC]{.mark} members]{.underline}** -- [partly
to cover up their own invariably wealthy, privileged or
bourgeois-assimilationist background]{.underline} -- **[[the enemy
is]{.mark} always to be [essentialized]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Since
the desires animating the VC are in large part priests' desires to
excommunicate and condemn, [there]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[be]{.mark} [a]{.mark} strong [distinction]{.mark} [between]{.mark}
[Good]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [Evil]{.mark}, with the latter essentialized.
Notice the tactics]{.underline}**. [X has made a remark/ has behaved in
a particular way -- these remarks/ this behaviour might be construed as
transphobic/ sexist etc]{.underline}. **[So far, OK]{.underline}**. But
[it's the next move which is the kicker**. X then becomes defined as a
transphobe/ sexist etc. Their whole identity becomes defined by one
ill-judged remark or behavioural slip**]{.underline}. **[Once the VC has
mustered its witch-hunt, the victim (often from a working class
background, and not schooled in the passive aggressive etiquette of the
bourgeoisie) can reliably be goaded into losing their temper, further
securing their position as pariah/ latest to be consumed in feeding
frenzy. The fifth law of the Vampires' Castle: [think]{.mark}
[like]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [liberal]{.mark} (because you are
one).]{.underline}** **[[The]{.mark} [VC]{.mark}'s work of constantly
stoking up reactive outrage [consists]{.mark} [of]{.mark} endlessly
[pointing]{.mark} [out]{.mark} [the]{.mark} screamingly
[obvious]{.mark}: [capital]{.mark} [behaves]{.mark} [like]{.mark}
[capital]{.mark} (it's not very nice!), repressive [state]{.mark}
[apparatuses]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [repressive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We
must protest! Neo-anarchy in the UK [The second libidinal formation is
neo-anarchism]{.underline}. By neo-anarchists [I definitely do not mean
anarchists or syndicalists involved in actual workplace
organisation]{.underline}, such as the Solidarity Federation. **[I mean,
rather, [those who identify as]{.mark} [anarchists]{.mark} [but]{.mark}
[whose]{.mark} [involvement]{.mark} in politics [extends]{.mark}
[little]{.mark} [beyond]{.mark} student [protests]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
occupations, and commenting on [Twitter]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Like the
denizens of the Vampires' Castle, [neo-anarchists usually come from a
petit-bourgeois background, if not from somewhere even more
class-privileged]{.underline}. They are also overwhelmingly young: in
their twenties or at most their early thirties, and what informs the
neo-anarchist position is a narrow historical horizon. Neo-anarchists
have experienced nothing but capitalist realism. By the time the
neo-anarchists had come to political consciousness -- and many of them
have come to political consciousness remarkably recently, given the
level of bullish swagger they sometimes display -- the Labour Party had
become a Blairite shell, implementing neo-liberalism with a small dose
of social justice on the side. **[But the problem with neo-anarchism is
that it unthinkingly reflects this historical moment rather than
offering any escape from it]{.underline}**. It forgets, or perhaps is
genuinely unaware of, the Labour Party's role in nationalising major
industries and utilities or founding the National Health Service.
[Neo-anarchists will assert that 'parliamentary politics never changed
anything']{.underline}, or [the 'Labour Party was always
useless']{.underline} while attending protests about the NHS, or
retweeting complaints about the dismantling of what remains of the
welfare state. **[[There's]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [strange]{.mark}
[implicit]{.mark} [rule]{.mark} here: [it's]{.mark} [OK]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [protest]{.mark} against what parliament has done,
[but]{.mark} [it's]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [alright]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[enter]{.mark} into parliament or the mass media [to attempt to engineer
change]{.mark} from there]{.underline}**. [Mainstream media is to be
disdained, but BBC Question Time is to be watched and moaned about on
Twitter]{.underline}. **[[Purism shades into
fatalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[better not to be in any way tainted
by the corruption of the mainstream, [better to uselessly
'resist']{.mark} [than]{.mark} to [risk]{.mark} [getting]{.mark} your
[hands]{.mark} [dirty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It's not surprising, then,
that so many neo-anarchists come across as depressed. This depression is
no doubt reinforced by the anxieties of postgraduate life, since, like
the Vampires' Castle, neo-anarchism has its natural home in
universities, and is usually propagated by those studying for
postgraduate qualifications, or those who have recently graduated from
such study. [**What is to be done?** Why have these two configurations
come to the fore]{.underline}? **[The first reason is that [they]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} [been]{.mark} [allowed]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[prosper]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [capital]{.mark} [because]{.mark}
[they]{.mark} [serve]{.mark} [its]{.mark}
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Capital]{.mark} [subdued]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} organised [working]{.mark} [class]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
[decomposing]{.mark} [class]{.mark} [consciousness]{.mark}, viciously
[subjugating]{.mark} [trade]{.mark} unions while [seducing]{.mark} 'hard
working [families']{.mark} [into]{.mark} [identifying]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} their own [narrowly]{.mark} [defined]{.mark}
[interests]{.mark} instead of the interests of the wider
class]{.underline}**; but [**why would capital be concerned about a
'left' that replaces class politics with a moralising individualism, and
that, far from building solidarity, spreads fear and insecurity?** The
second reason is]{.underline} what Jodi Dean has called **[communicative
capitalism]{.underline}**. **[It might have been possible to ignore the
Vampires' Castle and the neo-anarchists if it weren't for capitalist
cyberspace]{.underline}**. **[The VC's pious moralising has been a
feature of a certain 'left' for many years]{.underline}** -- **[but, if
one wasn't a member of this particular church, its sermons could be
avoided]{.underline}**. [Social media means that this is no longer the
case, and there is little protection from the psychic pathologies
propagated by these discourses. So what can we do now]{.underline}?
**[First of all, it is imperative to reject identitarianism, and to
recognise that there are no identities, only desires, interests and
identifications]{.underline}**. [Part of the importance of the British
Cultural Studies project]{.underline} -- as revealed so powerfully and
so movingly in John Akomfrah's installation The Unfinished Conversation
(currently in Tate Britain) and his film The Stuart Hall Project --
**[was to have resisted identitarian essentialism]{.underline}**.
**[Instead of freezing people into chains of already-existing
equivalences, the point was to treat any articulation as provisional and
plastic]{.underline}**. **[New articulations can always be
created]{.underline}**. **[No-one is essentially
anything]{.underline}**. [Sadly, the right act on this insight more
effectively than the left does]{.underline}. **[The
bourgeois-identitarian left knows how to propagate guilt and conduct a
witch hunt, but it doesn't know how to make converts]{.underline}**. But
[that, after all, is not the point]{.underline}. [The aim is not to
popularise a leftist position, or to win people over to it, but to
remain in a position of elite superiority, but now with class
superiority redoubled by moral superiority too. **'How dare you talk --
it's we who speak for those who suffer!'**]{.underline} But **[the
rejection of identitarianism can only be achieved by the re-assertion of
class]{.underline}**. **[A left that does not have class at its core can
only be a liberal pressure group]{.underline}**. [Class consciousness is
always double]{.underline}: [it involves a simultaneous knowledge of the
way in which class frames and shapes all experience, and a knowledge of
the particular position that we occupy in the class
structure]{.underline}. **[It must be remembered that the aim of our
struggle is not recognition by the bourgeoisie, nor even the destruction
of the bourgeoisie itself]{.underline}**. **[It is the class
structure]{.underline}** -- **[a structure that wounds everyone, even
those who materially profit from it]{.underline}** -- **[that must be
destroyed]{.underline}**. **[The interests of the working class are the
interests of all]{.underline}**; **[the interests of the bourgeoisie are
the interests of capital]{.underline}**, **[which are the interests of
no-one]{.underline}**. [**Our struggle must be towards the construction
of a new and surprising world, not the preservation of identities shaped
and distorted by capital.** If this seems like a forbidding and daunting
task, it is]{.underline}. But **[we can start to engage in many
prefigurative activities right now]{.underline}**. Actually, **[such
activities would go beyond pre-figuration -- they could start a virtuous
cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy in which bourgeois modes of
subjectivity are dismantled and a new universality starts to build
itself]{.underline}**. [We need to learn, or re-learn, how to build
comradeship and solidarity instead of doing capital's work for it by
condemning and abusing each other]{.underline}. **[This doesn't
mean]{.underline}**, of course, **[that we must always
agree]{.underline}** -- on the contrary, **[we must create conditions
where disagreement can take place without fear of exclusion and
excommunication]{.underline}**. [We need to think very strategically
about how to use social media]{.underline} -- [always remembering that,
despite the egalitarianism claimed for social media by capital's
libidinal engineers, that this is currently an enemy territory,
dedicated to the reproduction of capita]{.underline}l. But **[this
doesn't mean that we can't occupy the terrain and start to use it for
the purposes of producing class consciousness]{.underline}**. **[We must
break out of the 'debate' that communicative capitalism in which capital
is endlessly cajoling us to participate in, and remember that we are
involved in a class struggle]{.underline}**. **[The goal is not to 'be'
an activist, but to aid the working class to activate -- and transform
-- itself. Outside the Vampires' Castle, anything is
possible.]{.underline}**

Politics*, //Stefan\]

1\. At the beginning of the second decade of the Twenty-First Century,
[global civilization faces a new breed of cataclysm. These coming
apocalypses ridicule the norms and organisational structures
of]{.underline} the [politics]{.underline} which were forged in the
birth of the nation-state, the rise of capitalism, and a Twentieth
Century of unprecedented wars. 2. Most significant is [the breakdown of
the planetary climatic system.]{.underline} In time, this [threatens the
continued existence of the present global human population.]{.underline}
Though this is the most critical of the threats which face humanity, [a
series of lesser but potentially equally destabilising problems exist
alongside and intersect with it. Terminal resource depletion, especially
in water and energy reserves, offers the prospect of mass starvation,
collapsing economic paradigms, and new hot and cold wars. Continued
financial crisis has led governments to embrace the paralyzing death
spiral policies of austerity, privatisation of social welfare services,
mass unemployment, and stagnating wages. Increasing automation in
production processes including 'intellectual labour' is evidence of the
secular crisis of capitalism, soon to render it incapable of maintaining
current standards of living for even the former middle classes of the
global north]{.underline}. 3. In contrast to these ever-accelerating
catastrophes, [today's politics is beset by an inability to generate the
new ideas and modes of organisation necessary to transform our societies
to confront and resolve the coming annihilations. While crisis gathers
force and speed, politics withers and retreats. In this paralysis of the
political imaginary, the future has been cancelled]{.underline}. 4.
Since 1979, the hegemonic global political ideology has been
neoliberalism, found in some variant throughout the leading economic
powers. In spite of the deep structural challenges the new global
problems present to it, most immediately the credit, financial, and
fiscal crises since 2007 -- 8, neoliberal programmes have only evolved
in the sense of deepening. This continuation of the neoliberal project,
or [neoliberalism 2.0, has begun to apply another round of structural
adjustments, most significantly in the form of encouraging new and
aggressive incursions by the private sector into what remains of social
democratic institutions and services. This is in spite of the
immediately negative economic and social effects of such policies, and
the longer term fundamental barriers posed by the new global
crises]{.underline}. 5. [That the forces of right wing governmental,
non-governmental, and corporate power have been able to press forth with
neoliberalisation is at least in part a result of the continued
paralysis and ineffectual nature of much what remains of the left.
Thirty years of neoliberalism have rendered most left-leaning political
parties bereft of radical thought, hollowed out, and without a popular
mandate. At best they have responded to our present crises with calls
for a return to a Keynesian economics, in spite of the evidence that the
very conditions which enabled post-war social democracy to occur no
longer exist]{.underline}. We cannot return to mass industrial-Fordist
labour by fiat, if at all. Even the neo-socialist regimes of South
America's Bolivarian Revolution, whilst heartening in their ability to
resist the dogmas of contemporary capitalism, remain disappointingly
unable to advance an alternative beyond mid-Twentieth Century socialism.
Organised labour, being systematically weakened by the changes wrought
in the neoliberal project, is sclerotic at an institutional level
and --- at best --- capable only of mildly mitigating the new structural
adjustments. But with no systematic approach to building a new economy,
or the structural solidarity to push such changes through, for now
labour remains relatively impotent. [The new social
movements]{.underline} which emerged since the end of the Cold War,
experiencing a resurgence in the years after 2008[, have been similarly
unable to devise a new political ideological vision. Instead they expend
considerable energy on internal direct-democratic process and affective
self-valorisation over strategic efficacy, and frequently propound a
variant of neo-primitivist localism, as if to oppose the abstract
violence of globalised capital with the flimsy and ephemeral
"authenticity" of communal immediacy]{.underline}. 6. [In the absence of
a radically new social, political, organisational, and economic vision
the hegemonic powers of the right will continue to be able to push
forward their narrow-minded imaginary, in the face of any and all
evidence. At best, the left may be able for a time to partially resist
some of the worst incursions. But this is to be Canute against an
ultimately irresistible tide. To generate a new left global hegemony
entails a recovery of lost possible futures, and]{.underline} indeed
[the recovery of the future as such]{.underline}. 02. INTEREGNUM: On
Accelerationisms 1. If any system has been associated with ideas of
acceleration it is capitalism. The essential metabolism of capitalism
demands economic growth, with competition between individual capitalist
entities setting in motion increasing technological developments in an
attempt to achieve competitive advantage, all accompanied by increasing
social dislocation. In its neoliberal form, its ideological
self-presentation is one of liberating the forces of creative
destruction, setting free everaccelerating technological and social
innovations. 2. The philosopher Nick Land captured this most acutely,
with a myopic yet hypnotising belief that capitalist speed alone could
generate a global transition towards unparalleled technological
singularity. In this visioning of capital, the human can eventually be
discarded as mere drag to an abstract planetary intelligence rapidly
constructing itself from the bricolaged fragments of former
civilisations. However Landian neoliberalism confuses speed with
acceleration. [We may be moving fast, but only within a strictly defined
set of capitalist parameters that themselves never waver. We experience
only the increasing speed of a local horizon, a simple brain-dead onrush
rather than an acceleration which is also navigational, an experimental
process of discovery within a universal space of possibility. It is the
latter mode of acceleration which we hold as essentia]{.underline}l. 3.
Even worse, as Deleuze and Guattari recognized, from the very beginning
[what capitalist speed deterritorializes with one hand, it
reterritorializes with the other. Progress becomes constrained within a
framework of surplus value, a reserve army of labour, and free-floating
capital. Modernity is reduced to statistical measures of economic growth
and social innovation becomes encrusted with kitsch remainders from our
communal past.]{.underline} Thatcherite-Reaganite deregulation sits
comfortably alongside Victorian 'back-to-basics' family and religious
values. 4. A deeper tension within neoliberalism is in terms of its
self-image as the vehicle of modernity, as literally synonymous with
modernisation, whilst promising a future that it is constitutively
incapable of providing. Indeed, [as neoliberalism has progressed, rather
than enabling individual creativity, it has tended towards eliminating
cognitive inventiveness in favour of an affective production line of
scripted interactions, coupled to global supply chains and a neo-Fordist
Eastern production zone. A vanishingly small cognitariat of elite
intellectual workers shrinks with each passing year --- and increasingly
so as algorithmic automation winds its way through the spheres of
affective and intellectual labour.]{.underline} Neoliberalism, though
positing itself as a necessary historical development, was in fact a
merely contingent means to ward off the crisis of value that emerged in
the 1970s. Inevitably this was a sublimation of the crisis rather than
its ultimate overcoming. 5. It is Marx, along with Land, who remains the
paradigmatic accelerationist thinker. Contrary to the all-too familiar
critique, and even the behaviour of some contemporary Marxians, we must
remember that [Marx]{.underline} himself used the most advanced
theoretical tools and empirical data available in an attempt to fully
understand and transform his world. He was [not a thinker who resisted
modernity]{.underline}, but rather one who sought to analyse and
intervene within it, understanding that for all its exploitation and
corruption, capitalism remained the most advanced economic system to
date. Its gains were not to be reversed, but accelerated beyond the
constraints the capitalist value form. 6. Indeed, as even Lenin wrote in
the 1918 text "Left Wing" Childishness: [Socialism is inconceivable
without large-scale capitalist engineering based on the latest
discoveries of modern science.]{.underline} It is inconceivable without
planned state organisation which keeps tens of millions of people to the
strictest observance of a unified standard in production and
distribution. We Marxists have always spoken of this, and it is not
worth while wasting two seconds talking to people who do not understand
even this (anarchists and a good half of the Left Socialist--
Revolutionaries). 7. As Marx was aware, [capitalism cannot be identified
as the agent of true acceleration. Similarly, the assessment of left
politics as antithetical to technosocial acceleration is]{.underline}
also, at least in part, [a severe misrepresentation. Indeed, if the
political left is to have a future it must be one in which it maximally
embraces this suppressed accelerationist tendency]{.underline}. 03:
MANIFEST: On the Future 1. We believe the [most important division in
today's left is between those that hold to a folk politics of localism,
direct action, and relentless horizontalism, and those that outline what
must become called an accelerationist politics at ease with a modernity
of abstraction, complexity, globality, and technology. The former
remains content with establishing small and temporary spaces of
non-capitalist social relations, eschewing the real problems entailed in
facing foes which are intrinsically non-local, abstract, and rooted deep
in our everyday infrastructure. The failure of such politics has been
built-in from the very beginning. By contrast, an accelerationist
politics seeks to preserve the gains of late capitalism while going
further than its value system, governance structures, and mass
pathologies will allow]{.underline}. 2. All of us want to work less. It
is an intriguing question as to why it was that the world's leading
economist of the post-war era believed that an enlightened capitalism
inevitably progressed towards a radical reduction of working hours. In
The Economic Prospects for Our Grandchildren (written in 1930), Keynes
forecast a capitalist future where individuals would have their work
reduced to three hours a day. What has instead occurred is the
progressive elimination of the work-life distinction, with work coming
to permeate every aspect of the emerging social factory. 3. [Capitalism
has begun to constrain the productive forces of technology, or at least,
direct them towards needlessly narrow ends. Patent wars and idea
monopolisation are contemporary phenomena that point to both capital's
need to move beyond competition, and capital's increasingly retrograde
approach to technology. The properly accelerative gains of neoliberalism
have not led to less work or less stress. And rather than a world of
space travel, future shock, and revolutionary technological potential,
we exist in a time where the only thing which develops is marginally
better consumer gadgetry. Relentless iterations of the same basic
product sustain marginal consumer demand at the expense of human
acceleration.]{.underline}

5\. [Accelerationists want to unleash latent productive
forces.]{.underline} In this project, [the material platform of
neoliberalism does not need to be destroyed. It needs to be repurposed
towards common ends. The existing infrastructure is not a capitalist
stage to be smashed, but a springboard to launch towards
post-capitalism.]{.underline} 6. [Given the enslavement of technoscience
to capitalist objectives]{.underline} (especially since the late 1970s)
[we surely do not yet know what a modern technosocial body can
do]{.underline}. Who amongst us fully recognizes what untapped
potentials await in the technology which has already been developed? Our
wager is that [the true transformative potentials of much of our
technological and scientific research remain unexploited, filled with
presently redundant features]{.underline} (or pre-adaptations) that,
following a shift beyond the short-sighted capitalist socius, can become
decisive. 7. [We want to accelerate the process of technological
evolution. But what we are arguing for is not techno-utopianism. Never
believe that technology will be sufficient to save us. Necessary, yes,
but never sufficient without socio-political action. Technology and the
social are intimately bound up with one another, and changes in either
potentiate and reinforce changes in the other.]{.underline} Whereas the
techno-utopians argue for acceleration on the basis that it will
automatically overcome social conflict, [our position is that technology
should be accelerated precisely because it is needed in order to win
social conflicts.]{.underline} 8. We believe that [any post-capitalism
will require post-capitalist planning. The faith placed in the idea
that, after a revolution, the people will spontaneously constitute a
novel socioeconomic system that isn't simply a return to capitalism is
naïve at best, and ignorant at wors]{.underline}t. To further this[, we
must develop both a cognitive map of the existing system and a
speculative image of the future economic system.]{.underline} 9. To do
so, [the left must take advantage of every technological and scientific
advance made possible by capitalist society.]{.underline} We declare
that [quantification is not an evil to be eliminated, but a tool to be
used in the most effective manner possible. Economic modelling
is --- simply put --- a necessity for making intelligible a complex
world]{.underline}. The 2008 financial crisis reveals the risks of
blindly accepting mathematical models on faith, yet this is a problem of
illegitimate authority not of mathematics itself. The tools to be found
in social network analysis, agent-based modelling, big data analytics,
and non-equilibrium economic models, are necessary cognitive mediators
for understanding complex systems like the modern economy. The
accelerationist left must become literate in these technical fields. 10.
[Any transformation of society must involve economic and social
experimentation.]{.underline} The Chilean Project Cybersyn is emblematic
of this experimental attitude --- fusing advanced cybernetic
technologies, with sophisticated economic modelling, and a democratic
platform instantiated in the technological infrastructure itself.
Similar experiments were conducted in 1950s -- 1960s Soviet economics as
well, employing cybernetics and linear programming in an attempt to
overcome the new problems faced by the first communist economy. That
both of these were ultimately unsuccessful can be traced to the
political and technological constraints these early cyberneticians
operated under. 11. [The left must develop sociotechnical hegemony: both
in the sphere of ideas, and in the sphere of material platforms.
Platforms are the infrastructure of global society.]{.underline} They
establish the basic parameters of what is possible, both behaviourally
and ideologically. In this sense, [they embody the material
transcendental of society: they are what make possible particular sets
of actions, relationships, and powers. While much of the current global
platform is biased towards capitalist social relations, this is not an
inevitable necessity. These material platforms of production, finance,
logistics, and consumption can and will be reprogrammed and re-formatted
towards post-capitalist ends]{.underline}. 12. We do not believe that
direct action is sufficient to achieve any of this. [The habitual
tactics of marching, holding signs, and establishing temporary
autonomous zones risk becoming comforting substitutes for effective
success. "At least we have done something" is the rallying cry of those
who privilege self-esteem rather than effective action. The only
criterion of a good tactic is whether it enables significant success or
not. We must be done with fetishising particular modes of action.
Politics must be treated as a set of dynamic systems, riven with
conflict, adaptations and counter-adaptations, and strategic arms
races.]{.underline} This means that each individual type of political
action becomes blunted and ineffective over time as the other sides
adapt. [No given mode of political action is historically
inviolable.]{.underline} Indeed, [over time, there is an increasing need
to discard familiar tactics as the forces and entities they are
marshalled against learn to defend and counter-attack them
effectively.]{.underline} It is in part the contemporary left's
inability to do so which lies close to the heart of the contemporary
malaise. 13. The overwhelming privileging of democracy-as-process needs
to be left behind. [The fetishisation of openness, horizontality, and
inclusion of much of today's 'radical' left set the stage for
ineffectiveness. Secrecy, verticality, and exclusion all have their
place as well in effective political action]{.underline} (though not, of
course, an exclusive one). 14. Democracy cannot be defined simply by its
means --- not via voting, discussion, or general assemblies. [Real
democracy must be defined by its goal --- collective self-mastery. This
is a project which must align politics with the legacy of the
Enlightenment, to the extent that it is only through harnessing our
ability to understand ourselves and our world better]{.underline} (our
social, technical, economic, psychological world) [that we can come to
rule ourselves. We need to posit a collectively controlled legitimate
vertical authority in addition to distributed horizontal forms of
sociality, to avoid becoming the slaves of either a tyrannical
totalitarian centralism or a capricious emergent order beyond our
control]{.underline}. The command of The Plan must be married to the
improvised order of The Network. 15. We do not present any particular
organisation as the ideal means to embody these vectors. What is
needed --- what has always been needed --- is [an ecology of
organisations, a pluralism of forces, resonating and feeding back on
their comparative strengths. Sectarianism is the death knell of the
left]{.underline} as much as centralization is, and in this regard we
continue to welcome experimentation with different tactics (even those
we disagree with). 16. We have three medium term concrete goals. First,
[we need to build an intellectual infrastructure.]{.underline} Mimicking
the Mont Pelerin Society of the neoliberal revolution, this is to [be
tasked with creating a new ideology, economic and social models, and a
vision of the good to replace and surpass the emaciated ideals that rule
our world today.]{.underline} This is an infrastructure in the sense of
requiring the construction not just of ideas, but institutions and
material paths to inculcate, embody and spread them. 17. [We need to
construct wide-scale media reform]{.underline}. In spite of the seeming
democratisation offered by the internet and social media, traditional
media outlets remain crucial in the selection and framing of narratives,
along with possessing the funds to prosecute investigative journalism.
Bringing these bodies as close as possible to popular control is crucial
to undoing the current presentation of the state of things. 18. Finally,
[we need to reconstitute various forms of class power. Such a
reconstitution must move beyond the notion that an organically generated
global proletariat already exists. Instead it must seek to knit together
a disparate array of partial proletarian identities, often embodied in
post-Fordist forms of precarious labour]{.underline}. 19. Groups and
individuals are already at work on each of these, but each is on their
own insufficient. What is required is all three feeding back into one
another, with each modifying the contemporary conjunction in such a way
that the others become more and more effective. [A positive feedback
loop of infrastructural, ideological, social and economic
transformation, generating a new complex hegemony, a new post-capitalist
technosocial platform. History demonstrates it has always been a broad
assemblage of tactics and organisations which has brought about
systematic change]{.underline}; these lessons must be learned. 20. To
achieve each of these goals, on the most practical level we hold that
the accelerationist left must think more seriously about the flows of
resources and money required to build an effective new political
infrastructure. Beyond the 'people power' of bodies in the street, we
require funding, whether from governments, institutions, think tanks,
unions, or individual benefactors. We consider the location and
conduction of such funding flows essential to begin reconstructing an
ecology of effective accelerationist left organizations. 21. We declare
that [only a Promethean politics of maximal mastery over society and its
environment is capable of either dealing with global problems or
achieving victory over capital.]{.underline} This mastery must be
distinguished from that beloved of thinkers of the original
Enlightenment. The clockwork universe of Laplace, so easily mastered
given sufficient information, is long gone from the agenda of serious
scientific understanding. But this is not to align ourselves with the
tired residue of postmodernity, decrying mastery as proto-fascistic or
authority as innately illegitimate. Instead we propose that [the
problems besetting our planet and our species oblige us to refurbish
mastery in a newly complex guise; whilst we cannot predict the precise
result of our actions, we can determine probabilistically likely ranges
of outcomes]{.underline}. What must be coupled to such complex systems
analysis is a new form of action: improvisatory and capable of executing
a design through a practice which works with the contingencies it
discovers only in the course of its acting, in a politics of geosocial
artistry and cunning rationality. A form of abductive experimentation
that seeks the best means to act in a complex world. 22. We need to
revive the argument that was traditionally made for postcapitalism: [not
only is capitalism an unjust and perverted system, but it is also a
system that holds back progress. Our technological development is being
sup-pressed by capitalism, as much as it has been unleashed.
Accelerationism is the basic belief that these capacities can and should
be let loose by moving beyond the limitations imposed by capitalist
society.]{.underline} The movement towards a surpassing of our current
constraints must include more than simply a struggle for a more rational
global society. We believe it must also include recovering the dreams
which transfixed many from the middle of the Nineteenth Century until
the dawn of the neoliberal era, of the quest of Homo Sapiens towards
expansion beyond the limitations of the earth and our immediate bodily
forms. These visions are today viewed as relics of a more innocent
moment. Yet they both diagnose the staggering lack of imagination in our
own time, and offer the promise of a future that is affectively
invigorating, as well as intellectually energising. After all, it is
only a post-capitalist society, made possible by an accelerationist
politics, which will ever be capable of delivering on the promissory
note of the mid-Twentieth Century's space programmes, to shift beyond a
world of minimal technical upgrades towards all-encompassing change.
Towards a time of collective self-mastery, and the properly alien future
that entails and enables. Towards a completion of the Enlightenment
project of self-criticism and self-mastery, rather than its elimination.
23. [The choice facing us is severe: either a globalised post-capitalism
or a slow fragmentation towards primitivism, perpetual crisis, and
planetary ecological collapse. 24. The future needs to be constructed.
It has been demolished by neoliberal capitalism and reduced to a
cut-price promise of greater inequality, conflict, and
chaos.]{.underline} This collapse in the idea of the future is
symptomatic of the regressive historical status of our age, rather than,
as cynics across the political spectrum would have us believe, a sign of
sceptical maturity. What [accelerationism pushes towards is a future
that is more modern --- an alternative modernity that neoliberalism is
inherently unable to generate. The future must be cracked open once
again, unfastening our horizons towards the universal possibilities of
the Outside.]{.underline}

the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work*, 2015, //Stefan\]

Today [it appears that the greatest amount of effort is needed to
achieve the smallest degree of change.]{.underline} Millions march
against the Iraq War, yet it goes ahead as planned. Hundreds of
thousands protest austerity, but unprecedented budget cuts continue.
Repeated student protests, occupations and riots struggle against rises
in tuition fees, but they continue their inexorable advance. Around the
world, people set up protest camps and mobilise against economic
inequality, but the gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing.
[From the alter-globalisation struggles of the late 1990s, through the
antiwar and ecological coalitions of the early 2000s, and into the new
student uprisings and Occupy movements since 2008, a common pattern
emerges: resistance struggles rise rapidly, mobilise increasingly large
numbers of people, and yet fade away only to be replaced by a renewed
sense of apathy, melancholy and defeat. Despite the desires of millions
for a better world, the effects of these movements prove
minimal.]{.underline} A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE PROTEST
Failure permeates this cycle of struggles, and as a result, many of the
tactics on the contemporary left have taken on a ritualistic nature,
laden with a heavy dose of fatalism. The dominant tactics -- protesting,
marching, occupying, and various other forms of direct action -- have
become part of a well-established narrative, with the people and the
police each playing their assigned roles. The limits of these actions
are particularly visible in those brief moments when the script changes.
As one activist puts it, of a protest at the 2001 Summit of the
Americas: On April 20, the first day of the demonstrations, we marched
in our thousands towards the fence, behind which 34 heads of state had
gathered to hammer out a hemispheric trade deal. Under a hail of
catapult-launched teddy bears, activists dressed in black quickly
removed the fence's supports with bolt cutters and pulled it down with
grapples as onlookers cheered them on. For a brief moment, nothing stood
between us and the convention centre. We scrambled atop the toppled
fence, but for the most part we went no further, as if our intention all
along had been simply to replace the state's chain-link and concrete
barrier with a human one of our own making.1 We see here [the symbolic
and ritualistic nature of the actions, combined with the thrill of
having done something -- but with a deep uncertainty that appears at the
first break with the expected narrative.]{.underline} The role of
dutiful protestor had given these activists no indication of what to do
when the barriers fell. [Spectacular political
confrontations]{.underline} like the Stop the War marches, the
now-familiar melees against the G20 or World Trade Organization and the
rousing scenes of democracy in Occupy Wall Street all [give the
appearance of being highly significant]{.underline}, as if something
were genuinely at stake.2 Yet [nothing changed, and long-term victories
were traded for a simple registration of discontent. To outside
observers, it is often not even clear what the movements want, beyond
expressing a generalised discontent with the world.]{.underline} The
contemporary protest has become a melange of wild and varied demands.
The 2009 G20 summit in London, for instance, featured protestors
marching for issues that spanned from grandiose anti-capitalist
stipulations to modest goals centred on more local issues. When demands
can be discerned at all, they usually fail to articulate anything
substantial. [They are often nothing more than empty slogans -- as
meaningful as calling for world peace.]{.underline} In more recent
struggles, the very idea of making demands has been questioned. The
Occupy movement infamously struggled to articulate meaningful goals,
worried that anything too substantial would be divisive.3 And a broad
range of student occupations across the Western world has taken up the
mantra of 'no demands' under the misguided belief that demanding nothing
is a radical act.4 When asked what the ultimate upshot of these actions
has been, participants differ between admitting to a general sense of
futility and pointing to the radicalisation of those who took part. If
we look at protests today as an exercise in public awareness, they
appear to have had mixed success at best. Their messages are mangled by
an unsympathetic media smitten by images of property destruction --
assuming that the media even acknowledges a form of contention that has
become increasingly repetitive and boring. Some argue that, rather than
trying to achieve a certain end, these movements, protests and
occupations in fact exist only for their own sake.5 The aim in this case
is to achieve a certain transformation of the participants, and create a
space outside of the usual operations of power. While there is a degree
of truth to this[, things like protest camps tend to remain ephemeral,
small-scale and ultimately unable to challenge the larger structures of
the neoliberal economic system. This is politics transmuted into
pastime]{.underline} -- politics-as-drug-experience, perhaps -- [rather
than anything capable of transforming society. Such protests are
registered only in the minds of their participants, bypassing any
transformation of social structures]{.underline}. [While these efforts
at radicalisation and awareness-raising are undoubtedly important to
some degree, there still remains the question of exactly when these
sequences might pay off.]{.underline} Is there a point at which a
critical mass of consciousness-raising will be ready for action?
Protests can build connections, encourage hope and remind people of
their power. Yet, beyond these transient feelings, politics still
demands the exercise of that power, lest these affective bonds go to
waste. If we will not act after one of the largest crises of capitalism,
then when? The emphasis on the affective aspects of protests plays into
a broader trend that has come to privilege the affective as the site of
real politics. [Bodily, emotional and visceral elements come to replace
and stymie]{.underline} (rather than complement and enhance) [more
abstract analysis.]{.underline} The contemporary landscape of social
media, for example, is littered with the bitter fallout from an endless
torrent of outrage and anger. Given the individualism of current social
media platforms -- premised on the maintenance of an online identity --
it is perhaps no surprise to see online 'politics' tend towards the
[self-presentation of moral purity.]{.underline} We are more concerned
to appear right than to think about the conditions of political change.
Yet these [daily outrages pass as rapidly as they emerge, and we are
soon on to the next]{.underline} vitriolic [crusade]{.underline}. In
other places, public demonstrations of empathy with those suffering
replace more finely tuned analysis, resulting in hasty or misplaced
action -- or none at all. While politics always has a relationship to
emotion and sensation (to hope or anger, fear or outrage), when taken as
the primary mode of politics, these impulses can lead to deeply perverse
results. In a famous example, 1985's Live Aid raised huge amounts of
money for famine relief through a combination of heartstring-tugging
imagery and emotionally manipulative celebrity-led events. The sense of
emergency demanded urgent action, at the expense of thought. Yet the
money raised actually extended the civil war causing the famine, by
allowing rebel militias to use the food aid to support themselves.6
While viewers at home felt comforted they were doing something rather
than nothing, a dispassionate analysis revealed that they had in fact
contributed to the problem. These unintended outcomes become even more
pervasive as the targets of action grow larger and more abstract. [If
politics without passion leads to cold-hearted, bureaucratic
technocracy, then passion bereft of analysis risks becoming a
libidinally driven surrogate for effective action. Politics comes to be
about feelings of personal empowerment, masking an absence of strategic
gains.]{.underline} Perhaps most depressing, [even when movements have
some successes, they are in the context of overwhelming
losses.]{.underline} Residents across the UK, for example, have
successfully mobilised in particular cases to stop the closure of local
hospitals. Yet these real successes are overwhelmed by larger plans to
gut and privatise the National Health Service. Similarly, recent
anti-fracking movements have been able to stop test drilling in various
localities -- but governments nevertheless continue to search for shale
gas resources and provide support for companies to do so.7 In the United
States, various movements to stop evictions in the wake of the housing
crisis have made real gains in terms of keeping people in their homes.8
Yet the perpetrators of the subprime mortgage debacle continue to reap
the profits, waves of foreclosures continue to sweep across the country,
and rents continue to surge across the urban world. Small successes --
useful, no doubt, for instilling a sense of hope -- nevertheless wither
in the face of overwhelming losses. Even the most optimistic activist
falters in the face of struggles that continue to fail. In other cases,
well-intentioned projects like Rolling Jubilee strive to escape the
spell of neoliberal common sense.9 The ostensibly radical aim of
crowdsourcing money to pay the debts of the underprivileged means buying
into a system of voluntary charity and redistribution, as well as
accepting the legitimacy of the debt in the first place. In this
respect, the initiative is one among a larger group of projects that act
simply as crisis responses to the faltering of state services. These are
[survival mechanisms, not a desirable vision for the
future]{.underline}. What can we conclude from all of this? The [recent
cycle of struggles has to be identified as one of overarching failure,
despite a multitude of small-scale successes and moments of large-scale
mobilisation]{.underline}. The question that any analysis of the left
today must grapple with is simply: What has gone wrong? It is undeniable
that heightened repression by states and the increased power of
corporations have played a significant role in weakening the power of
the left. Still, [it remains debatable whether the repression faced by
workers, the precarity of the masses and the power of capitalists is any
greater than it was in the late nineteenth century.]{.underline} Workers
then were still struggling for basic rights, often against states more
than willing to use lethal violence against them.10 But [whereas that
period saw mass mobilisation, general strikes, militant labour and
radical women's organisations all achieving real and lasting successes,
today is defined by their absence]{.underline}. The recent weakness of
the left cannot simply be chalked up to increased state and capitalist
repression: an honest reckoning must accept that problems also lie
within the left. One key problem is a widespread and uncritical
acceptance of what we call 'folk-political' thinking. DEFINING FOLK
POLITICS What is folk politics? [Folk politics names a constellation of
ideas and intuitions within the contemporary left that informs the
common-sense ways of organising, acting and thinking politics. It is a
set of strategic assumptions that threatens to debilitate the left,
rendering it unable to scale up, create lasting change or expand beyond
particular interests. Leftist movements under the sway of folk politics
are]{.underline} not [only unlikely to be successful]{.underline} --
they are in fact [incapable of transforming capitalism.]{.underline} The
term itself draws upon two senses of 'folk'. First, it evokes critiques
of folk psychology which argue that our intuitive conceptions of the
world are both historically constructed and often mistaken.11 Secondly,
it refers to 'folk' as the locus of the small-scale, the authentic, the
traditional and the natural. Both of these dimensions are implied in the
idea of folk politics. As a first approximation, [we can]{.underline}
therefore [define folk politics as a collective and historically
constructed political common sense that has become out of joint with the
actual mechanisms of power]{.underline}. As our political, economic,
social and technological world changes, tactics and strategies which
were previously capable of transforming collective power into
emancipatory gains have now become drained of their effectiveness. As
the common sense of today's left, [folk politics often operates
intuitively, uncritically and unconsciously]{.underline}. Yet common
sense is also historical and mutable. It is worth recalling that today's
familiar forms of organisation and tactics, far from being natural or
pre-given, have instead been developed over time in response to specific
political problems. Petitions, occupations, strikes, vanguard parties,
affinity groups, trade unions: all arose out of particular historical
conditions.12 Yet [the fact that certain ways of organising and acting
were once useful does not guarantee their continued
relevance.]{.underline} Many of the tactics and organisational
structures that dominate the contemporary left are responses to the
experience of state communism, exclusionary trade unions, and the
collapse of social democratic parties. Yet the ideas that made sense in
the wake of those moments no longer present effective tools for
political transformation. Our world has moved on, becoming more complex,
abstract, nonlinear and global than ever before. [Against the
abstraction and inhumanity of capitalism, folk politics aims to bring
politics down to the 'human scale' by emphasising temporal, spatial and
conceptual immediacy. At its heart, folk politics is the guiding
intuition that immediacy is always better and often more authentic, with
the corollary being a deep suspicion of abstraction and
mediation.]{.underline} In terms of temporal immediacy, [contemporary
folk politics typically remains reactive]{.underline} (responding to
actions initiated by corporations and governments, rather than
initiating actions);13 [ignores long-term strategic goals in favour of
tactics]{.underline} (mobilising around single-issue politics or
emphasising process);14 [prefers practices that are often inherently
fleeting]{.underline} (such as occupations and temporary autonomous
zones);15 [chooses the familiarities of the past over the unknowns of
the future]{.underline} (for instance, the repeated dreams of a return
to 'good' Keynesian capitalism);16 [and expresses itself as a
predilection for the voluntarist and spontaneous over the
institutional]{.underline} (as in the romanticisation of rioting and
insurrection).17 In terms of spatial immediacy, [folk politics
privileges the local as the site of authenticity]{.underline} (as in the
100-miles diet or local currencies);18 [habitually chooses the small
over the large]{.underline} (as in the veneration of small-scale
communities or local businesses);19 [favours projects that are
un-scalable beyond a small community]{.underline} (for instance, general
assemblies and direct democ racy);20 [and often rejects the project of
hegemony, valuing withdrawal or exit rather than building a broad
counter-hegemony]{.underline}.21 Likewise[, folk politics prefers that
actions be taken by participants themselves -- in its emphasis on direct
action, for example -- and sees decision-making as something to be
carried out by each individual rather than by any
representative]{.underline}. [The problems of scale and extension are
either ignored or smoothed]{.underline} over in folk-political thinking.
Finally, in terms of conceptual immediacy, there is [a preference for
the everyday over the structural, valorising personal experience over
systematic thinking; for feeling over thinking, emphasising individual
suffering, or the sensations of enthusiasm and anger experienced during
political actions; for the particular over the universal, seeing the
latter as intrinsically totalitarian; and for the ethical over the
political]{.underline} -- as in ethical consumerism, or moralising
critiques of greedy bankers.22 Organisations and communities are to be
transparent, rejecting in advance any conceptual mediation, or even
modest amounts of complexity. The [classic images of universal
emancipation and global change have been transformed into a
prioritisation of the suffering of the particular and the authenticity
of the loca]{.underline}l. As a result, [any process of constructing a
universal politics is rejected from the outset]{.underline}. Understood
in these ways, we can detect traces of folk politics in organisations
and movements like Occupy, Spain's 15M, student occupations, left
communist insurrectionists like Tiqqun and the Invisible Committee, most
forms of horizontalism, the Zapatistas, and contemporary
anarchist-tinged politics, as well as a variety of other trends like
political localism, the slow-food movement, and ethical consumerism,
among many others. But no single position embodies all of these
dispositions, which leads us to a first qualification: as an uncritical
and often unconscious common sense, folk politics comes to be
instantiated to varying degrees in concrete political positions. That is
to say, [folk politics does not name an explicit position, but only an
implicit tendency. The ideas that characterise this tendency are widely
dispersed throughout the contemporary left, but some positions are more
folk-political than others.]{.underline} This brings us to a second
important qualification: [the problem with folk politics is not that it
starts from the local; all politics begins from the local. The problem
is rather that folk-political thinking is content to remain at (and even
privileges) that level]{.underline} -- of [the transient, the
small-scale, the unmediated and the particular. It takes these to be
sufficient rather than simply necessary moments.]{.underline} Therefore,
the point is not simply to reject folk politics[.]{.underline} Folk
politics is a necessary component of any successful political project,
but it can only be a starting point. A third qualification is that folk
politics is only a problem for particular types of projects: those that
seek to move beyond capitalism. Folk-political thinking can be perfectly
well adapted to other political projects: projects aimed solely at
resistance, movements organised around local issues, and small-scale
projects. Political movements based around keeping a hospital open or
preventing evictions are all admirable, but they are importantly
different from movements trying to challenge neoliberal capitalism. The
idea that one organisation, tactic or strategy applies equally well to
any sort of struggle is one of the most pervasive and damaging beliefs
among today's left. Strategic reflection -- on means and ends, enemies
and allies -- is necessary before approaching any political project.
[Given the nature of global capitalism, any postcapitalist project will
require an ambitious, abstract, mediated, complex and global approach --
one that folk-political approaches are incapable of
providing.]{.underline} Combining these qualifications, we can therefore
say that folk politics is necessary but insufficient for a
postcapitalist political project. [By emphasising and remaining at the
level of the immediate, folk politics lacks the tools to transform
neoliberalism into something else. While folk politics can undoubtedly
make important interventions in local struggles, we deceive ourselves
when we think these are turning the tide against global capitalism. They
represent, at best, temporary respite against its
onslaught.]{.underline} The project of this book is to begin outlining
an alternative -- a way for the left to navigate from the local to the
global, and synthesise the particular with the universal. Such an
alternative cannot simply be a conservative reversion to the
working-class politics of the last century. It must instead combine an
updated way of thinking politics (a shift from immediacy to structural
analysis) with an upgraded means of doing politics (which directs action
towards building platforms and expanding scales). OVERWHELMED Why did
folk politics arise in the first place? Why is it that folk political
tendencies, for all their manifest flaws, are so seductive and appealing
to the movements of today? At least three answers present themselves.
The first explanation is to see folk politics as a response to the
problem of how to interpret and act within an ever more complex world.
The second, related explanation involves situating folk politics as a
reaction to the historical experiences of the communist and social
democratic left. Finally, folk politics is a more immediate response to
the empty spectacle of contemporary party politics. Increasingly,
multipolar global politics, economic instability, and anthropogenic
climate change outpace the narratives we use to structure and make sense
of our lives. Each of these is an example of what is termed a complex
system, which features nonlinear dynamics, where marginally different
inputs can cause dramatically divergent outputs, intricate sets of
causes feedback on one another in unexpected ways, and which
characteristically operates on scales of space and time that go far
beyond any individual's unaided perception.23 Globalisation,
international politics, and climate change: each of these systems shapes
our world, but their effects are so extensive and complicated that it is
difficult to place our own experience within them. The global economy is
a good example of this. In simple terms, the economy is not an object
amenable to direct perception; it is distributed across time and space
(you will never meet 'the economy' in person); it incorporates a wide
array of elements, from property laws to biological needs, natural
resources to technological infrastructures, market stalls and
supercomputers; and it involves an enormous and intricately interacting
set of feedback loops, all of which produce emergent effects that are
irreducible to its individual components.24 In other words, the
interaction of an economy's parts produces effects that cannot be
understood just by knowing how those parts work in isolation -- it is
only in grasping the relations between them that the economy can be made
sense of. While we might have an idea of what an economy consists of, we
will never be able to experience it directly in the same way as other
phenomena. It can only be observed symptomatically through key
statistical indexes (charting changes in inflation or interest rates,
stock indexes, GDP, and so on), but can never be seen, heard or touched
in its totality. As a result, despite everything that has been written
about capitalism, we still struggle to understand its dynamics and its
mechanisms. Most importantly, we lack a 'cognitive map' of our
socioeconomic system: a mental picture of how individual and collective
human action can be situated within the unimaginable vastness of the
global economy.25 Recent decades have seen an increasing complexity in
the dynamics that impinge upon politics. We might consider the imminent
threat of anthropogenic climate change as a new kind of problem -- one
that is unamenable to any simple solution and that involves such
intricately woven effects that it is hard to even know where to
intervene. Equally, the global economy today appears significantly more
complex in terms of the mobility of capital, the intricacies of global
finance and the multiplicity of actors involved. How well do our
traditional political images of the world map onto these changes? For
the left at least, an analysis premised on the industrial working class
was a powerful way to interpret the totality of social and economic
relations in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, thereby
articulating clear strategic objectives. Yet the history of the global
left over the course of the twentieth century attests to the ways in
which this analysis failed to attend to both the range of possible
liberating struggles (based in gender, race or sexuality) and the
ability of capitalism to restructure itself -- through the creation of
the welfare state, or the neoliberal transformations of the global
economy. Today, the old models often falter in the face of new problems;
we lose the capacity to understand our position in history and in the
world at large. This separation between everyday experience and the
system we live within results in increased alienation: we feel adrift in
a world we do not understand. The cultural theorist Fredric Jameson
notes that the proliferation of conspiracy theories is partly a response
to this situation.26 Conspiracy theories act by narrowing the agency
behind our world to a single figure of power (the Bilderberg Group, the
Freemasons or some other convenient scapegoat). Despite the
extraordinary complexity of some of these theories, they nevertheless
provide a reassuringly simple answer to 'who is behind it all', and what
our own role is in the situation. In other words, they act precisely as
a (faulty) cognitive map. Folk politics presents itself as another
possible response to the problems of overwhelming complexity. If we do
not understand how the world operates, the folk-political injunction is
to reduce complexity down to a human scale. Indeed, folk-political
writing is saturated with calls for a return to authenticity, to
immediacy, to a world that is 'transparent', 'human-scaled', 'tangible',
'slow', 'harmonious', 'simple', and 'everyday'.27 Such thinking rejects
the complexity of the contemporary world, and thereby rejects the
possibility of a truly postcapitalist world. It attempts to give a human
face to power; whereas what is truly terrifying is the generally
asubjective nature of the system. The faces are interchangeable; the
power remains the same. The turn towards localism, temporary moments of
resistance, and the intuitive practices of direct action all effectively
attempt to condense the problems of global capitalism into concrete
figures and moments. In this process, folk politics often reduces
politics to an ethical and individual struggle. There is a tendency
sometimes to imagine that we simply need 'good' capitalists, or a
'responsible' capitalism. At the same time, the imperative to 'make it
local' leads folk politics to fetishise immediate results and the
concrete appearance of action. Delaying a corporate attack on the
environment, for instance, is lauded as a success -- even if the company
simply waits out public attention before returning once again. Moreover,
as Rosa Luxemburg pointed out long ago, [the fetishisation of 'immediate
results' leads to an empty pragmatism that struggles to maintain the
present balance of power, rather than seeking to change structural
conditions.]{.underline}28 Without the necessary abstraction of
strategic thought, tactics are ultimately fleeting gestures. Finally,
the abjuring of complexity dovetails with the neoliberal case for
markets. One of the primary arguments made against planning has been
that the economy is simply too complex to be guided.29 The only
alternative is therefore to leave the distribution of resources to the
market and reject any attempt to guide it rationally.30 Considered in
all these ways, [folk politics appears as an attempt to make global
capitalism small enough to be thinkable -- and at the same time, to
articulate how to act upon this restricted image of
capitalism]{.underline}. By contrast, the argument of this book is that
[folk-political tendencies are mistaken. If complexity presently
outstrips humanity's capacities to think and control, there are two
options: one is to reduce complexity down to a human scale; the other is
to expand humanity's capacities. We endorse the latter
position.]{.underline} [Any postcapitalist project will necessarily
require the creation of new cognitive maps, political narratives,
technological interfaces, economic models, and mechanisms of collective
control to be able to marshal complex phenomena for the betterment of
humanity.]{.underline}

[Just as the new social movements were on the rise, the economic basis
of the social democratic consensus was beginning to fall apart. The
1970s saw surging energy prices, the collapse of the Bretton Woods
system, the growth of global capital flows, persistent stagflation and
falling capitalist profits.]{.underline}43 [This]{.underline}
effectively [ended the basic political settlement that had supported the
postwar era]{.underline}: that unique nexus of Keynesian economic
policy, Fordist--corporatist industrial production and the broadly
social democratic consensus that returned a part of the social surplus
back to workers. Across the world, the structural crisis presented an
opportunity for the forces of both the broad left and the broad right to
generate a new hegemony that could resolve it. [For the right, the
challenge was to restore capital accumulation and profitability. This
challenge was eventually answered by the emergence of neoliberal thought
on the global stage]{.underline}; but even before that, right-wing
forces in the UK and the United States were experimenting with new ways
to outmanoeuvre both the old and new left. One particularly important
approach was a political-economic strategy to link the crisis of
capitalism to union power. The subsequent defeat of organised labour
throughout the core capitalist nations has perhaps been neoliberalism's
most important achievement, significantly changing the balance of power
between labour and capital. The means by which this was achieved were
diverse, from physical confrontation and combat,44 to using legislation
to undermine solidarity and industrial action, to embracing shifts in
production and distribution that compromised union power (such as
disaggregating supply chains), to re-engineering public opinion and
consent around a broadly neoliberal agenda of individual freedom and
'negative solidarity'. The latter denotes more than mere indifference to
worker agitations -- it is the fostering of an aggressively enraged
sense of injustice, committed to the idea that, because I must endure
increasingly austere working conditions (wage freezes, loss of benefits,
a declining pension pot), then everyone else must as well. The result of
these combined shifts was a hollowing-out of unions and the defeat of
the working class in the developed world.45 While the right successfully
faced the structural crisis by consolidating its political and economic
power, the movements of the old and new left were unable to confront
this new configuration of forces. In the 1970s, socialist and even
communist political parties were gradually able to gain increasing
ground in elections in Western Europe; but the old left simply tried to
resolve the crisis by doubling down on the traditional corporatist
agenda.46 But the old Keynesian policy formulations were unable to
kick-start growth, restrain unemployment or reduce inflation under these
new economic conditions. As a result, left-wing governments coming to
power in the 1970s, such as the British Labour Party, often ended up
having to implement proto-neoliberal policies in frustrated attempts to
foster a recovery.47 The traditional labour movement, decrepit and
stagnant, was by now being bested and co-opted by the forces of the
right. In this context, the new left was a necessary critique that was
essential to the left's revitalisation and progress. Yet, as we saw in
the previous section, if the old labour organisations were in many
senses bereft of ideas, the new left was unable to institutionalise
itself and articulate a counter-hegemony. The result was a left that
became increasingly marginalised. As neoliberalism expanded and
consolidated its common sense, the remaining social democratic parties
increasingly came to accept neoliberalism's terms. With most major
parties effectively signed up to its political and economic programme,
and increasing numbers of public services being taken into private
hands, the ability to achieve significant change at the ballot box was
dramatically reduced. Widespread cynicism began to accompany a
hollowed-out party politics that came to resemble the public relations
industry, with politicians being reduced to the role of shopkeepers
hawking undesirable wares.48 Mass participation in electoral politics
declined in tandem with the gradual acceptance of the neoliberal
coordinates, and the age of post-politics was upon us. Mass voter
disaffection is the result today, with voter turnout routinely at
historic lows. Under these circumstances, the folk-political insistence
on immediate results and small-scale participatory democracy has an
obvious allure. The position of the new social movements in this context
was more ambiguous. By the 1990s, the positioning of the working class
as privileged political subject had been fully broken down, and a much
wider array of social identities, desires and oppressions had gained
recognition.49 Increasingly sophisticated attempts were made to develop
the analysis of interacting power structures, giving rise to ideas of
intersectional oppressions.50 As a result of cultural dissemination and
mainstream political endorsement, large parts of the programmes of
feminist, anti-racist and queer political movements had become enshrined
in law and embraced on a social level. But despite these successes,
there had been a rollback from the kind of radical demands outlined in
the 1970s, which envisaged a much more thorough transformation of
society. Feminists, for example, have made significant gains in terms of
pay equality, abortion rights and childcare policies, but these pale in
comparison to projects for the total abolition of gender.51 Similarly,
for many black liberation movements, while anti-racist employment
policies and antidiscrimination laws were widely enacted, they had not
been accompanied by other radical programmes espoused by earlier
movements.52 Much of the success seen by the new social movements today
is confined within the hegemonic terms established by neoliberalism --
articulated around market-centred claims, liberal rights and a rhetoric
of choice. What have been sidelined in the process are the more radical
and anti-capitalist elements of these projects. Looking back, we have
the collapse of the traditional organisations of the left, and the
simultaneous rise of an alternative new left predicated upon critiques
of bureaucracy, verticality, exclusion and institutionalisation,
combined with an incorporation of some of the new desires into the
apparatus of neoliberalism. It was against this backdrop that
folk-political intuitions increasingly sedimented as a new common sense
and came to be expressed in the alter-globalisation movements.53 These
movements emerged in two phases. The first, appearing from the mid 1990s
through to the early 2000s, consisted of groups such as the Zapatistas,
anti-capitalists, alter-globalisers, and participants in the World
Social Forum and global anti-war protests. A second phase began
immediately after the 2007--09 financial crisis and featured various
groups united by their similar organisational forms and ideological
positions, including the Occupy movement, Spain's 15M and various
national-level student movements. Both phases of the newest social
movements sought to counter neoliberalism and its national and corporate
avatars, with the first phase targeting global trade and governance
organizations, and the latter focusing more on financialisation,
inequality and debt.54 Drawing influence from the earlier social
movements, this latest cycle of struggles comprises groups that tend to
privilege the local and the spontaneous, the horizontal and the
anti-state. The apparent plausibility of folk politics rests on the
collapse of traditional modes of organisation on the left, of the
co-optation of social democratic parties into a choice-less neoliberal
hegemony, and the broad sense of disempowerment engendered by the
insipidness of contemporary party politics. In a world where the most
serious problems we face seem intractably complex, folk politics
presents an alluring way to prefigure egalitarian futures in the
present. On its own, however, this kind of politics is unable to give
rise to long-lasting forces that might supersede, rather than merely
resist, global capitalism.

#### Tag- horizontalism

**Srnicek and Williams 15** \[Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, tag teamed
Badiou one time, *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World
Without Work*, 2015, //Stefan\]

Crystallising in 1970s US social movements and thrust into prominence by
the Zapatistas, alter-globalisation activists and the movement of the
squares, horizontalism has become the dominant strand of today's radical
left.2 Responding to the twentieth-century failures of state-led
political change, horizontalist movements instead advocate changing the
world by changing social relations from below.3 They draw upon a long
tradition of theory and practice in anarchism, council communism,
libertarian communism and autonomism, in order to -- in the words of one
proponent -- 'change the world without taking power'.4 At the heart of
these movements lies a rejection of the state and other formal
institutions, and a privileging of society as the space from which
radical change will emerge. Horizontalism rejects the project of
hegemony as intrinsically domineering, putting forth an affinity-based
politics in its stead.5 Rather than advocating an appeal to or takeover
of the vertical power of the state, horizontalism argues for freely
associating individuals to come together, create their own autonomous
communities and govern their own lives. In broad terms, we can summarise
these ideas in terms of four major commitments: 1.A rejection of all
forms of domination 2.An adherence to direct democracy and/or consensus
decision-making6 3.A commitment to prefigurative politics 4.An emphasis
on direct action Embedded within this set of commitments is a series of
problems that constrain and limit their potential in the struggle
against global capitalism. Horizontalism's focus on domination in all
its forms is perhaps its signal contribution.7 Moving beyond the old
left's traditional focus on the state and capital, it emphasises the
various ways in which other types of domination continue to structure
society (racial, patriarchal, sexual, ableist, and so on). It is a
significant advance that many of today's radical left have adopted these
ideas and centred their practice upon the complete removal of all forms
of oppression -- a commitment that we believe any serious leftist
politics must adopt. Yet the means by which horizontalist movements
attempt to overcome domination and oppression often end up being bound
by the limits of folk politics. In seeking the direct and unmediated
cancellation of social relations of domination, these movements either
tend to ignore the more subtle forms of domination that persist, or else
fail to construct persistent political structures able to maintain the
new social relations in the long term. The commitment to avoiding all
forms of domination is closely tied to a critique of representation --
both conceptual and political. In practice, this has led to a rejection
of the more hierarchical structures that characterise representative
politics.8 Having experienced the history of corrupt trade unions and
rapidly eroded liberal democracies, representation is seen as inevitably
leading to self-serving and dominant elites. These structures are to be
replaced by direct forms of democracy that privilege immediacy over
mediation, invoking a more personal sense of politics.9 The idea here is
that a 'face-to-face democracy' is presumably more natural and
authentic, and less prone to the emergence of hierarchies.10 Political
decisions are to be made not by representatives, but instead by
individuals representing themselves in person.11 Direct democracy ends
up being taken as a basic value, underpinned by the folk-political
intuition that what is immediate is better than what is mediated. Rather
than majority rule, parliamentary procedure, or dictates from a central
committee, it is consensus that is often the major aim of discussions.12
Debate and governance should therefore be maximally inclusive, and the
process of deliberation itself, as opposed to just its outcomes, is
something to be valued.13 Participatory democracy is understandably a
major attraction for many people, particularly in light of the empty,
ritualistic gestures of contemporary representative democracies.14 Many
participants speak of the feelings of empowerment they derive from
participating in consensus decision-making processes.15 Maximal
inclusivity and consensus are therefore valorised, and the importance of
tactics and process is placed above strategic objectives. Direct
democracy, consensus and inclusivity all form part of horizontalism's
commitments to prefigurative politics, which aims to create in the
here-and-now the world they would like to see. Prefigurative politics is
a longstanding tradition on the left, from the anarchism of Kropotkin
and Bakunin onwards, but it has only recently come to characterise the
leading edges of left-wing politics. The earlier promise that, after the
revolution, hierarchies and exclusions would evaporate was little
consolation to the women and people of colour whose concerns were
ignored by yet another white male leader. Rather than wait for a
purported revolution, prefigurative politics attempts to instantiate a
new world immediately -- again relying on an implicit sense that
immediacy is inherently superior to more mediated approaches. At its
best, prefigurative politics attempts to embody utopian impulses in
bringing the future into concrete existence today.16 Yet at its worst,
an insistence on prefiguration becomes a dogmatic assertion that the
means must match the ends, accompanied by ignorance of the structural
forces set against it.17 If the aim is to create the world we want in
the here-and-now, and if recourse to mediating institutions is forbidden
(or at least disavowed), then the appropriate form of practice has to be
direct action. This is a form of practice that encompasses a wide range
of possible tactics, ranging from theatrical protests in the vein of the
Situationists, to wildcat strikes, to blockading ports, to burning down
luxury housing developments. In these practices we can again see hints
of folk politics -- the privileging of the direct, the immediate and the
intuitive. To be sure, direct action can sometimes be more effective and
useful than protests -- such as pouring concrete to destroy
anti-homeless spikes, or using slow-down methods in workplace
struggles.18 Yet, as we will see, direct action often remains
insufficient to secure longstanding change, and in isolation, is
typically only a temporary impediment to the powers of state and
capital. Direct democracy, prefigurative politics and direct action are
not, we hasten to add, intrinsically flawed.19 Rather than being
denounced in themselves, their utility needs to be judged relative to
particular historical situations and particular strategic objectives --
in terms of their ability to exert real power to create genuine lasting
transformation. The reality of complex, globalised capitalism is that
small interventions consisting of relatively non-scalable actions are
highly unlikely to ever be able to reorganise our socioeconomic system.
As we suggest in the second half of this book, the tactical repertoire
of horizontalism can have some use, but only when coupled with other
more mediated forms of political organisation and action. Following this
broad overview of horizontalism's theoretical commitments and the
general issues associated with them, we can now turn to two important
sequences in twenty-first-century politics to highlight both the
practical possibilities and the strong folk-political limits built into
these models. In what follows, we examine two of the strongest cases for
horizontalism: the Occupy movement emerging after the 2008 financial
crisis and the Argentinean experience in the wake of the country's 2001
default. In each case, we can see both the real successes and the
palpable limits of these approaches.

#### Tag- localism

**Srnicek and Williams 15** \[Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, *Inventing
the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work*, 2015, //Stefan\]

Less [politically radical than horizontalism, though no less ubiquitous,
is localism.]{.underline} As an ideology, localism extends far beyond
the left, inflecting the politics of pro-capitalists, anti-capitalists,
radicals and mainstream culture alike, as a new kind of political common
sense. Shared between all of these is a belief that the abstraction and
sheer scale of the modern world is at the root of our present political,
ecological and economic problems, and that the solution therefore lies
in adopting a 'small is beautiful' approach to the world.69 Small-scale
actions, local economies, immediate communities, face-to-face
interaction -- all of these responses characterise the localist
worldview. [In a time when most of the political strategies and tactics
developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries appear blunted and
ineffectual, localism has a seductive logic to it.]{.underline} In all
its diverse variants, from centre-right communitarianism70 to ethical
consumerism,71 developmental microloans, and contemporary anarchist
practice,72 [the promise it offers to do something concrete, enabling
political action with immediately noticeable effects, is empowering on
an individual level]{.underline}. But [this sense of empowerment can be
misleading.]{.underline} The problem with [localism]{.underline} is
that, [in attempting to reduce large-scale systemic problems to the more
manageable sphere of the local community]{.underline}, it [effectively
denies the systemically interconnected nature of today's
world]{.underline}. Problems such as [global exploitation, planetary
climate change, rising surplus populations, and the repeated crises of
capitalism are abstract in appearance, complex in structure, and
non-localised.]{.underline} Though they touch upon every locality, they
are never fully manifested in any particular region. Fundamentally,
these are systemic and abstract problems, requiring systemic and
abstract responses. While much of the populist localism on the right can
easily be dismissed as regressive macho fantasy (for example,
secessionist libertarianism), sinister ideological cover for austerity
economics (the UK Conservative Party's 'Big Society') or downright
racist (the nationalist or fascist blaming of immigrants for structural
economic problems), the localism of the left has been less thoroughly
scrutinised. Though undoubtedly well-meaning, both the radical and
mainstream left partake in localist politics and economics to their
detriment. In what follows we will critically examine two of the more
popular variants -- local food and economic localism -- which in very
different areas exemplify the problematic dynamics of localism in
general. Local food With a cachet that reaches far beyond typical
political circles, localism has recently come to dominate discussions of
the production, distribution and consumption of food. Most influential
here have been the interlinked movements known as 'slow food' and
'locavorism' (eating locally). The slow-food movement began in the mid
1980s in Italy, partly as a protest against the ever-increasing
encroachment of fast-food chains. Slow food, as its name suggests,
stands for everything McDonald's does not: local food, traditional
recipes, slow eating and highly skilled production.73 It is food that
offers the most visceral embodiment of the benefits of the slow
lifestyle, overcoming the vicissitudes of fast-paced capitalism by
returning to an older culture of savouring meals and traditional
production techniques.74 But even its proponents admit that there are
difficulties involved in living the slow-food lifestyle: 'Few of us have
the time, money, energy or discipline to be a model Slow Foodie.'75
Without an assessment of how our lives are structured by social,
political and economic pressures that make it easier to eat pre-prepared
food than embrace the slow-food lifestyle, the end result is a variant
of ethical consumerism with a hedonistic twist. It is patently correct
that taking one's time to enjoy a well-prepared meal can be a
pleasurable experience. Paying attention to a meal recasts the
experience from one of pure utility into a more social and aesthetic
experience. But there are structural reasons why we do not choose to do
this often -- reasons that are not the result of any individual moral
failing. The structure of work, for example, is a primary reason why
many of us are unable to enjoy slow eating, or meals prepared according
to the ideals of the slow-food movement. Slow food might not always
require money, but it always requires time. For those who have to work
multiple jobs to support their families, time is at a premium. What is
more, the gender politics of slow food are problematic, given that we
live in patriarchal societies where the majority of food preparation is
still presumed to be the task of wives and mothers.76 While 'fast' food
or pre-prepared meals might be unhealthy, their popularity enables the
freeing up of women to live lives that are less marked by the everyday
drudgery of feeding their families.77 As innocent as it may at first
seem, the slow-food movement, like many other forms of ethical
consumerism, fails to think in large-scale terms about how its ideas
might work within the broader context of rapacious capitalism. Closely
linked to the slow-food movement are locavorism and the '100-mile diet'
-- a food politics that emphasises eating locally. Locavorism holds that
locally sourced food is not only more likely to be healthy, but is also
a vital component of our efforts to reduce carbon outputs, and hence our
impact on the environment. It situates itself, therefore, as a response
to a global issue. Moreover, locavorism claims to be one way to overcome
the alienation of our relationship to food under capitalism. By eating
food grown or produced in our locality, so this logic runs, we will be
able to get back in touch with the production of our food and reclaim it
from the dead hands of a capitalism that has run amok.78 Compared to the
slow-food movement, locavorism positions itself more explicitly, and
politically, against globalisation. In doing so, it appeals to a
constellation of folk-political ideas relating to the primacy of the
local as a horizon of political action, and of the virtues of the local
over the global, the immediate over the mediated, the simple over the
complex. These ideas condense often complex environmental issues into
questions of individual ethics. One of the most serious (and
intrinsically collective) crises of our times is thus effectively
privatised. This personalised environmental ethic is exemplified in
localist food politics -- in particular, in the moral (and price)
premium placed on locally grown food. Here we find ecologically
motivated arguments (for reducing energy expenditure by reducing the
distances over which food is transported, for example) combined with
class differentiation (in the form of marketing designed to promote
identification with organic food). Similarly, complex problems are
condensed into poorly formulated shorthand. For instance, the idea of
'food miles' -- identifying the distances that food products have
travelled, so as to reduce carbon outputs -- appears a reasonable one.
The problem is that it is all too often taken to be sufficient on its
own as a guide to ethical action. As a 2005 report by the UK's
Department of Agriculture and Food found, while the environmental
impacts of transporting food were indeed considerable, a single
indicator based on total food miles was inadequate as a measure of
sustainability.79 Most notably, the food-miles metric emphasises an
aspect of food production that contributes a relatively small amount to
overall carbon outputs. When it is simply assumed that 'small is
beautiful', we can all too easily ignore the fact that the energy costs
associated with producing food locally may well exceed the total costs
of transporting it from a more suitable climate.80 Even for the purpose
of assessing the contribution of food transportation, food miles are a
poor metric. Air freight, for example, makes up a relatively small
portion of total food miles, but it makes up a disproportionately large
slice of total food-related CO2 emissions.81 The energy consumption
involved in putting food on our plates is important, but it cannot be
captured in anything as simple as food miles, or in the idea that 'local
is best'. Indeed, highly inefficient local food production techniques
may be more costly than efficiently grown globally sourced foodstuffs.
The bigger question here relates to the priorities we place on the types
of food we produce, how that production is controlled, who consumes that
food and at what cost. Localist food politics flattens the complexities
it is trying to resolve into a simplistic binary: global, bad; local,
good. What is needed, by contrast, are less simplistic ways of looking
at complex problems -- an analysis that takes into account the global
food system as a whole, rather than intuitive shorthand formulae such as
food miles, or 'organic' versus non-'organic' foods. It is likely that
the ideal method of global food production will be some complex mixture
of local initiatives, industrial farming practices, and global systems
of distribution. It is equally likely that an analysis capable of
calculating the best means to grow and distribute food lies outside the
grasp of any individual consumer, requiring significant technical
knowledge, collective effort and global coordination. None of this is
well served by a culture that simply values the local. Local economics
Localism, in all its forms, represents an attempt to abjure the problems
and politics of scale involved in large systems such as the global
economy, politics and the environment. Our problems are increasingly
systemic and global, and they require an equally systemic response.
Action must always to some extent occur at the local level -- and indeed
some localist ideas, such as resiliency, can be useful. But
localism-as-ideology goes much further, rejecting the systemic analysis
that might guide and coordinate instances of local action to confront,
oppose and potentially supplant oppressive instances of global power or
looming planetary threats. Nowhere is the inability of localist
solutions to challenge complex global problems more apparent than in
movements towards localised business, banking and economics. Since the
2008 financial crisis, there have been a number of trends on the broad
left towards reforming our economic and monetary systems. While much of
this work is useful, one prominent strand has focused on transforming
economic systems through localisation. The problem with big business, so
the thinking goes, is not so much its inherently exploitative nature but
the scale of the enterprises involved. Smaller businesses and banks
would supposedly be more reflective of the local community's needs. One
popular recent campaign, the 'move your money' movement, centred on the
idea that, if it was the scale of banks that was to blame for the
financial crisis, then customers ought to move their funds collectively
to smaller, more virtuous institutions. Ethical-consumerist campaigns
like this offer a semblance of effective action -- they provide a
meaningful narrative about the problems of the system and indicate the
simple and pain-free action necessary to resolve it. As with most
folk-political actions, it has all the appearances and feeling of having
done something. Major banks are positioned as the bad guys, and
individuals can supposedly produce significant effects just by moving
their money into smaller, local banks and credit unions. What this model
neglects is the complex abstractions of the modern banking system. Money
circulates as immediately global and immediately interconnected with
every other market. In any situation where a small bank or credit union
has more deposits than it is able to profitably reinvest within its
locality, it will inevitably seek investments within the broader
financial system. Indeed, a reading of the accounts of smaller banks in
the United States reveals that they partake in and contribute to the
same global financial markets as everyone else -- investing in Treasury,
mortgage or corporate bonds while often participating in socially
destructive lending practices that equal those of the major banks.82
While clearly a reformist measure, 'move your money' might at least have
been expected to lead to some transformations in the composition of the
US banking system. However, as of September 2013, total assets held by
the six largest US banks had increased by 37 per cent since the
financial crisis. Indeed, by every available measure the big US banks
are larger today than at the beginning of the crisis, holding 67 per
cent of all assets in the US banking system.83 And while legislative
efforts across the world have made some attempts to impose restraints on
the activities that led to the crisis (requiring increased capital asset
ratios and regular 'stress tests' designed to avoid further bailouts),
risky lending continues,84 and risky derivatives holdings remain at
staggeringly high levels.85 If localist efforts to constrain the size of
the largest banks appear doomed to failure, what are we to make of
alternative campaigns to replicate some of the local banks that make up
much of the continental European banking system? For example, 70 per
cent of the German banking sector consists of community or smaller-sized
banks.86 German and Swiss community banks, their proponents argue, pool
risks collectively and are mutually owned, with high degrees of autonomy
to take advantage of local knowledge, and as a result generally remained
profitable throughout the financial crisis.87 It is also argued that
local banks of this type are more likely to lend to small businesses
than the larger institutions that are more common in the United States
and the UK. There are advantages to some local banking models, but their
stability is often overstated. For example, despite being highly
localised and under community control, Spain's community banks (the
cajas) took significant risks in the property market and other
speculative investments in the 2000s, necessitating thoroughgoing
financial restructuring after the 2008 crisis. Though under the alleged
control of boards with community representation, investment decisions
were effectively taken with little proper oversight. Localisation here
meant the politicisation of allegedly disinterested governance boards,
turning some cajas into platforms for local government investment in
speculative property schemes, as a culture of cronyism took hold.88 With
the worst of Spain's banking crisis centred on the local banks,
restructuring meant the merging of local banks to form larger
institutions. Even in Germany, often touted as having the best localised
banking system in the world, there were issues with some regional banks.
The Landesbanken, for example, were heavily invested in structured
credit products that performed particularly poorly during the financial
crisis.89 The lesson to draw from this is that there is nothing inherent
in smaller institutions that will enable them to resist the worst
excesses of contemporary finance -- and that the idea of cleanly
separating the local from the global is today impossible. Political
capture, the need to seek profitable investments beyond those available
in the local area, and simply the high returns of more risky
investments, are all factors leading local banks to participate in the
broader financial system. Even mutual ownership is no guarantee of
financial probity, as demonstrated by the recent travails of the UK's
Co-operative Bank, which almost collapsed entirely following an
ill-conceived takeover of a building society in 2009.90 The systemic
problems of the financial system can only be properly dealt with by
taking apart financial power, whether by means of broad regulation (as
was briefly achieved under postwar Keynesianism) or more revolutionary
methods. Fetishising the small and the local seems to be a means of
simply ignoring the more significant ways in which the system could be
transformed for the better.

While nostalgia for a lost past is clearly not an adequate response,
neither is today's widespread glorification of resistance. [Resistance

other words, it is [a defensive and reactive gesture, rather than an
active movement.]{.underline} [We do not resist a new world into being;
we resist in the name of an old world]{.underline}. The contemporary
emphasis on resistance therefore belies a defensive stance towards the
encroachments of expansionary capitalism. Trade unions, for instance,
position themselves as resisting neoliberalism with demands to 'save our
health system' or 'stop austerity'; but these demands simply reveal a
conservative disposition at the heart of the movement. According to
these demands, [the best one can hope for is small impediments in the
face of a predatory capitalism. We can only struggle to keep what we
already have, as limited and crisis-ridden as it may be.]{.underline}
Even in left-leaning Latin America this trend is visible, with the most
significant successes largely around efforts to impede transnational
corporations, particularly in relation to mining.93 In many circles
[resistance has come to be glorified, obscuring the conservative nature
of such a stance behind a veil of radical rhetoric. Resistance is seen
to be all that is possible, while constructive projects are nothing but
a dream.]{.underline}94 While it can be important in some circumstances,
[in the task of building a new world, resistance is futile.]{.underline}
Other movements argue for an approach of withdrawal, whereby individuals
exit from existing social institutions. Horizontalism is closely linked
to this approach, being predicated on the rejection of existing
institutions and the creation of autonomous forms of community. Indeed,
the recent history of activism has tended towards such approaches.95
Often these approaches are explicitly opposed to complex societies,
meaning that the ultimate implied destination is some form of
communitarianism or anarcho-primitivism.96 Others suggest making oneself
invisible in order to evade detection and repression by the state.97 At
the extreme, some argue for what amounts to a left-wing survivalism:
civilisation is in catastrophe,98 and we should therefore become
invisible,99 retreat to small communes,100 and learn how to grow food,
hunt, heal and defend ourselves.101 If left at the level of survivalism,
these kinds of positions, while perhaps unappealing, would at least have
some consistency. They at least have the virtue of being open about
their implications. However, [arguments for withdrawal and exit too
easily confuse the idea of a social logic separate from capitalism with
a social logic that is antagonistic to capitalism]{.underline} -- or, in
an even stronger claim, that poses a threat to capitalist logics.102 Yet
[capitalism has been and will continue to be compatible with a wide
range of different practices and autonomous spaces.]{.underline} The
Spanish town of Marinaleda offers a useful example of this. Over the
course of three decades, this small community (pop. 2,700) has built up
a 'communist utopia' that has expropriated land, built its own housing
and co-operatives, kept living costs low, and provided work for
everyone. Yet the limits of such an approach for transforming capitalism
are quickly revealed: housing materials are provided by the regional
government, agricultural subsidies come from the European Union, jobs
are sustained by the rejection of labour-saving devices, income still
comes from selling goods on wider capitalist markets, and businesses
remain subjected to capitalist competition and the global financial
crisis.103 Marinaleda is but one example of how [the project of
withdrawing, escaping or exiting from capitalism is still contained
within a folk-political horizon, within which defending small bunkers of
autonomy against the onslaught of capitalism is the best that can be
hoped for. Yet we would argue not only that more can be hoped for (and
achieved), but that, in the absence of broad and systematic contention,
even those small pockets of resistance are likely to be swiftly
eradicated.]{.underline}

Horizontalism, localism, nostalgia, resistance and withdrawal all
embody, to greater or lesser degrees, folk-political intuitions about
how to do politics. And they all remain inadequate for the task of
transforming capitalism. But this is not to say that they should be
rejected in their entirety. As the rest of the book will make clear,
there are a number of important elements to retain rom these approaches.
Rather than being intrinsically malign, folk politics is simply partial,
temporary and insufficient. Various horizontalist approaches, for
example, have raised important questions about power, domination and
hierarchy -- but they have not developed adequate responses to them.
Folk politics as a tendency retreats from the difficulty of these
problems by attempting to dispel them from the outset. Yet, in a world
where dominance, power, hierarchy and exploitation are imposed upon us,
such questions must be confronted directly, rather than retreated
from.104 Likewise, in a banal sense, all politics is local. We act upon
things in our immediate vicinity in order to change larger political
structures. We cannot simply reject the local. But today's
folk-political tendencies invoke a stronger sense of local politics: a
retreat into the local in order to avoid the problems of a complex and
abstract society; an assumption about the authenticity and naturalness
of the local; and a neglect of scalable and sustainable practices that
might go beyond the local. While all politics begins within the local,
folk politics remains local. In the end, a significant part of the
problem with folk politics lies less in the particular tactics and
practices it tends to adhere to than in the overarching strategic vision
into which it is placed. Protests, marches, occupations, sit-ins and
blockades all have their place: none of these tactics in themselves are
fundamentally folk-political. But when they are marshalled by a
strategic vision that sees temporary and small-scale changes as the
horizon of success, or when they are extrapolated beyond the particular
conditions that made them effective, they are inevitably going to be
bound up within folk-political thinking. If the tactic of occupation,
for example, is employed in order to create exemplars and temporary
spaces of non-capitalist social relations, it will inevitably fail to
achieve substantial change. If, on the other hand, it is understood as a
mechanism to produce solidarity networks and mobilise them for further
action, then it may still have use within broader counter-hegemonic
strategies. But this sort of strategic reflection about the virtues and
limits of any particular action is what is absent from too much of the
left today. The numerous protests and marches and occupations typically
operate without any sense of strategy, simply acting as dispersed and
independent blips of resistance. There is far too little thought given
to how to combine these various actions, and how they might function
together to collectively build a better world. Instead we are left with
actions that sometimes succeed but which rarely have an overarching eye
to how this contributes to medium-and long-term goals.105 In the next
chapter, we look at how the right undertook such strategic reflection
and orchestrated a situation in which neoliberalism became the dominant
common sense of our time.

#### Thesis card- neoliberalism

**Srnicek and Williams 15** \[Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, communist
IT guys, *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without
Work*, 2015, //Stefan\]

If our era is dominated by one hegemonic ideology, it is that of
neoliberalism. It is widely assumed that the most effective away to
produce and distribute goods and services is by allowing instrumentally
rational individuals to exchange via the market. State regulations and
national industries are, by contrast, seen as distortions and
inefficiencies holding back the productive dynamics inherent to free
markets. Today, this vision of how economies should operate is what both
its critics and proponents take as a baseline. Neoliberalism sets the
agenda for what is realistic, necessary and possible. While the economic
crisis of 2008 has upset the blind belief in neoliberalism, it
nevertheless remains an entrenched part of our worldview -- so much so
that it is difficult even for its critics to picture coherent
alternatives. Yet this ideology of neoliberalism did not emerge fully
formed from the minds of Milton Friedman or Friedrich Hayek, or even the
Chicago School, and its global hegemony did not arise inevitably from
capitalism's logic. In its origins, neoliberalism was a fringe theory.
Its adherents found it difficult to gain employment, were often
untenured, and were mocked by the Keynesian mainstream.1 Neoliberalism
was far from being the world-dominating ideology it would eventually
become. The question this chapter will focus on is: How did a small band
of neoliberals manage to reshape the world so radically? Neoliberalism
was never a given, never a necessary endpoint of capitalist
accumulation. Rather, it was a political project from the beginning, and
a massively successful one in the end. It succeeded by skilfully
constructing an ideology and the infrastructure to support it, and by
operating in a non--folk-political manner. This chapter aims to show
that neoliberalism functioned as an expansive universal ideology. From
humble beginnings, the universalising logic of neoliberalism made it
capable of spreading across the world, infiltrating the media, the
academy, the policy world, education, labour practices, and the affects,
feelings and identities of everyday people. This chapter therefore
focuses primarily on how neoliberal hegemony was constructed, rather
than on the specific content of neoliberalism. What is of greatest
interest is how it was able to transform the ideological and material
fabric of global society. What standard histories of neoliberalism often
neglect is the ways in which the main components of this ideological
architecture were systematically and painstakingly set in place in the
decades prior to the 1970s.2 It is in this prehistory of the neoliberal
era that we can discern an alternative mode of political action -- one
that evades the limits of folk politics. This is not to say that this
prehistory provides a model for any future leftist programme simply to
copy; rather, it is an instructive case study in how the right was able
to move beyond folk politics and create a new hegemony. The history of
neoliberalism has been one of contingencies, struggle, concentrated
action, patience and grand-scale strategic thinking. It has been a
flexible idea, actualised in various ways according to the specific
circumstances it encountered: from Germany in the 1940s, Chile in the
1970s and the UK in the 1980s, to post-Hussein Iraq in the 2000s. This
versatility has made neoliberalism a sometimes contradictory project,
but one that succeeds precisely by transforming these contradictions
into productive tensions.3 These tensions and variations have led some
to believe that the term 'neoliberalism' is meaningless and should be
relegated to polemics. But the term has some validity, even if it is
often used loosely. In popular perception, neoliberalism is usually
identified with a glorification of free markets -- a position that also
entails a commitment to free trade, private property rights and the free
movement of capital. Defining neoliberalism as the veneration of free
markets is problematic, however, because many ostensibly neoliberal
states do not adhere to free-market policies. Others have argued that
neoliberalism is predicated upon instilling competition wherever
possible.4 This makes sense of the drive towards privatisation, but it
fails to explain the debates within neoliberalism about whether
competition is an ultimate good or not.5 Some take into account these
tensions within neoliberalism and recognise it as the political, rather
than economic, project of a particular class.6 There is certainly some
truth to this claim, but, taken at face value, it cannot explain why
neoliberal ideology was rejected for so long by the capitalist classes
that purportedly benefit from it. Our view is that, contrary to its
popular presentation, neoliberalism differs from classical liberalism in
ascribing a significant role to the state.7 A major task of
neoliberalism has therefore been to take control of the state and
repurpose it.8 Whereas classical liberalism advocated respect for a
naturalised sphere supposedly beyond state control (the natural laws of
man and the market), neoliberals understand that markets are not
'natural'.9 Markets do not spontaneously emerge as the state backs away,
but must instead be consciously constructed, sometimes from the ground
up.10 For instance, there is no natural market for the commons (water,
fresh air, land), or for healthcare, or for education.11 These and other
markets must be built through an elaborate array of material, technical
and legal constructs. Carbon markets required years to be built;12
volatility markets exist in large part as a function of abstract
financial models;13 and even the most basic markets require intricate
design.14 Under neoliberalism, the state therefore takes on a
significant role in creating 'natural' markets. The state also has an
important role in sustaining these markets -- neoliberalism demands that
the state defend property rights, enforce contracts, impose anti-trust
laws, repress social dissent and maintain price stability at all costs.
This latter demand, in particular, has greatly expanded in the wake of
the 2008 crisis into the full-spectrum management of monetary issues
through central banks. We therefore make a grave mistake if we think the
neoliberal state is intended simply to step back from markets. The
unprecedented interventions by central banks into financial markets are
symptomatic not of the neoliberal state's collapse, but of its central
function: to create and sustain markets at all costs.15 Yet it has been
an arduous and winding path from neoliberalism's origins to the present,
in which its ideas hold sway over those injecting trillions of dollars
into the market.

#### Tag- universalism and left modernity

**Srnicek and Williams 15** \[Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, tag teamed
Badiou one time, *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World
Without Work*, 2015, //Stefan\]

This chapter marks a turning point. From the negative task of diagnosing
the strategic limitations of the contemporary left, this chapter begins
the positive project of elaborating an escape route from our current
condition. In the following chapters, we argue that [the contemporary
left should reclaim modernity, build a populist and hegemonic force, and
mobilise towards a post-work future. Folk-political attempts at
prefiguration, direct action and relentless horizontalism are unlikely
to achieve this]{.underline}, partly because [they misrecognise the
nature of their opponent. Capitalism is an aggressively expansive
universal, from which efforts to segregate a space of autonomy are bound
to fail]{.underline}.1 [Withdrawal, resistance, localism and autonomous
spaces represent a defensive game against an uncompromising and
incessantly encroaching capitalism]{.underline}. Moreover,
[particularisms can easily coexist with capitalist universalism. The
innumerable cultural and political variants of capitalism do little to
stifle the expansion of commodification, the creation of proletariats,
and the imperative of accumulation]{.underline}. The much-lamented
capacity of capitalism to incorporate resistance more often than not
simply reveals that [particularisms are, in themselves, incapable of
competing against a universalism.]{.underline}2 Indeed, given
neoliberalism's inherently expansionary nature, [only an alternative
expansionary and inclusive universal of some kind will be able to combat
and supersede capitalism on a global scale]{.underline}.3 With the
dynamics of accumulation at the heart of capital, [a non-expansionary
capitalism is an oxymoron. An ambitious leftist politics therefore
cannot be satisfied with measures to defend localities. It must seek
instead to construct a new future-oriented politics capable of
challenging capitalism at the largest scales. It must unmask the
pseudo-universality of capitalist social relations and recapture the
meaning of the future]{.underline}. This chapter takes a step back from
the empirical and historical focus of the earlier chapters, and seeks to
elaborate a philosophical ground for the chapters that follow. We argue
that [a key element of any future-oriented left must be to contest the
idea of 'modernity']{.underline}. Whereas [folk-political approaches
lack an enticing vision of the future]{.underline}, [struggles over
modernity have always been struggles over what the future should look
like]{.underline}: from the communist modernism of the early Soviet
Union to the scientific socialism of postwar social democracy, and on to
the sleek neoliberal efficiency of Thatcher and Reagan.4 [What it means
to be modern is not pre-established, but is instead a highly 'contested
field']{.underline}.5 Yet, in the face of capitalism's success at
universalising itself, [this term has been almost fully ceded to the
right.]{.underline} 'Modernisation' has come to signify simply some
dread combination of privatisation, heightened exploitation, rising
inequality and inept managerialism.6 Likewise, notions of the future
tend to revolve around ideas of ecological apocalypse, the dismantling
of the welfare state, or corporate-led dystopia, rather than anything
bearing the mark of utopia or universal emancipation. For many,
therefore, modernity is simply a cultural expression of capitalism.7
From this accepted wisdom, the necessary conclusion follows: only the
cancellation of modernity can bring about the end of capitalism. The
result has been [an anti-modern tendency within numerous social
movements from the 1970s onward.]{.underline} Yet [this mistaken
conflation of modernity with the institutions of capitalism overlooks
the alternative forms it can take, and the ways in which many
anti-capitalist struggles rely upon its ideals]{.underline}.[8 Modernity
presents both a narrative for popular mobilisation and a philosophical
framework for understanding the arc of history.]{.underline} As the term
that indexes the direction of society, it must be [a key discursive
battleground for any leftist politics invested in creating a better
world.]{.underline}9 This chapter sets out the broad philosophical
stakes of such a project by examining three factors that would help to
elaborate a left modernity: an image of historical progress, a
universalist horizon and a commitment to emancipation. In discussing
'modernity', we face the immediate problem of clarifying what it means.
It can refer to a chronological period, typically filtered through
European history with a variety of events having been posited as its
origin: the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the
Industrial Revolution.10 For others, modernity is defined by a distinct
set of practices and institutions: widespread bureaucratisation, a basic
framework of liberal democracy, the differentiation of social functions,
the colonisation of the non-European world, and the expansion of
capitalist social relations. Yet [modernity]{.underline} also [refers to
a repertoire of conceptual innovations revolving around universal ideals
of progress, reason, freedom and democracy]{.underline}. This chapter
emphasises these latter aspects: [modernity names a set of concepts that
have been independently developed in numerous cultures across the
world]{.underline}, but which took on a particular resonance in Europe.
[These are the elements of modernity that cannot be
renounced]{.underline}, and that form the well-spring from which more
popular discourses around modernisation are generated. The c[onceptual
ideals -- such as freedom, democracy and secularism -- are the source of
both capitalist modernity and the struggles against it. Ideas associated
with modernity animated the work of abolitionists, formed the basis of
numerous African trade union struggles]{.underline},11 and continue
today in 'those thousands of campaigns for wages, land rights, basic
health, and security, dignity, self-determination, autonomy, and so
forth'.12 In broad terms, then, whether it is explicitly recognised or
not, [the political struggles of today are struggles within the space of
modernity and its ideals. Modernity must be contested, not
rejected]{.underline}.13 HYPERSTITIONAL PROGRESS To invoke modernity is
ultimately to raise the question of the future. What should the future
look like? What courses should we set? What does it mean to be
contemporary? And whose future is it? Since the emergence of the term,
modernity has been concerned with unravelling a circular or
retrospective notion of time and introducing a rupture between the
present and the past. With this break, the future is projected as being
potentially different from and better than the past.14 [Modernity is
tantamount to 'the discovery of the future']{.underline} and has
therefore found itself intimately linked with notions such as 'progress,
advance, development, emancipation, liberation, growth, accumulation,
Enlightenment, embetterment, \[and the\] avant-garde'.15 Suggesting that
history can progress through deliberate human action, it is the nature
of this progress that competing definitions of modernity have struggled
over.16 Historically, [the left has found its natural home in being
oriented towards the future]{.underline}. From early communist visions
of technological progress, to Soviet space utopias, to the social
democratic rhetoric of the 'white heat of technology', what set the left
apart from the right was its unambiguous embrace of the future. The
future was to be an improvement over the present in material, social and
political terms. By contrast, [the forces of the political right
were]{.underline}, with a few notable exceptions, [defined by their
defence of tradition and their essentially reactionary
nature]{.underline}.17 This situation was reversed during the rise of
neoliberalism, with politicians like Thatcher commanding the rhetoric of
modernisation and the future to great effect. Co-opting these terms and
mobilising them into a new hegemonic common sense, neoliberalism's
vision of modernity has held sway ever since. Consequently, discussions
of the left in terms of the future now seem aberrant, even absurd. With
the postmodern moment, the seemingly intrinsic links between the future,
modernity and emancipation were prized apart. Philosophers like Simon
Critchley can now confidently assert that 'we have to resist the idea
and ideology of the future, which is always the ultimate trump card of
capitalist ideas of progress'.18 Such [folk-political sentiments blindly
accept the neoliberal common sense, preferring to shy away from grand
visions and replace them with a posturing resistance]{.underline}. From
the radical left's discomfort with technological modernity to the social
democratic left's inability to envision an alternative world, everywhere
today [the future has largely been ceded to the right. A skill that the
left once excelled at -- building enticing visions for a better world --
has deteriorated after years of neglect.]{.underline} If the left is to
recover a sense of progress, however, it cannot simply adopt the classic
images of history headed towards a singular destination. Progress, for
these approaches, was not only possible, but in fact woven as a
necessity into the very fabric of history. Human societies were thought
to travel along a pre-defined pathway towards a single outcome modelled
after Europe. The nations of Europe were deemed to have developed
capitalist modernity independently, and their historical experiences of
development were considered to be both necessary and superior to those
of other cultures.19 Such ideas dominated traditional European
philosophy and continued on in the influential modernisation literature
of the 1950s and 1960s, with their attempts to naturalise capitalism
against a Soviet opponent.20 Partly endorsed by both early Marxism and
later Keynesian and neoliberal capitalisms, a one-size-fits-all model of
historical progress positioned non-Western societies as lacking and in
need of development -- a position that served to justify colonial and
imperial practices.21 From the standpoint of their philosophical
critics, these notions of progress were disparaged precisely for their
belief in preconceived destinations -- whether in the liberal
progression towards capitalist democracy or in the Marxist progression
towards communism. The complex and often disastrous record of the
twentieth century demonstrated conclusively that history could not be
relied upon to follow any predetermined course.22 Regression was as
likely as progress, genocide as possible as democratisation.23 In other
words, there was nothing inherent in the nature of history, the
development of economic systems, or sequences of political struggle that
could guarantee any particular outcome. From a broadly left perspective,
for example, even [those limited but not insignificant political gains
that have been achieved -- such as welfare provision, women's rights and
worker protections -- can be rolled back.]{.underline} Moreover, even in
states where nominally communist governments took power, it proved far
more difficult than expected to transition from a capitalist system of
production to a fully communist one.24 This series of historical
experiences fuelled an internal critique of European modernity by way of
psychoanalysis, critical theory and poststructuralism. For the thinkers
of postmodernism, modernity came to be associated with a credulous
naivety.25 In Jean-François Lyotard's epochal definition, postmodernity
was identified as the era that has grown to be suspicious of the grand
metanarrative.26 On this account, postmodernity is a cultural condition
of disillusionment with the kinds of grandiose narratives represented by
capitalist, liberal and communist accounts of progress. To be sure,
these critiques capture something important about the chronological
texture of our time. And yet, the announcement of the end of grand
narratives has often been viewed by those outside Europe as being
absolutely of a piece with modernity.27 Further, with the benefit of
thirty years' hindsight, the broader impact of the cultural condition
diagnosed by Lyotard has not been the decline of belief in
metanarratives per se, but rather a broad disenchantment with those
offered by the left. The association between capitalism and
modernisation remains, while properly progressive notions of the future
have wilted under postmodern critique and been quashed beneath the
social wreckage of neoliberalism. Most significantly, with the collapse
of the Soviet Union and the rise of globalisation, history does appear
to have a grand narrative.28 Throughout the world, markets, wage labour,
commodities and productivity-enhancing technologies have all expanded
under the systemic imperative to accumulate. [Capitalism has become the
destiny of contemporary societies, happily coexisting with national
differences and paying little heed to clashes between
civilisations.]{.underline} But we can draw a distinction here between
the endpoint (capitalism) and the pathway towards it. Indeed, the mutual
entanglement of countries means that the European pathway (heavily
reliant on exploiting colonies and slavery) is barred for many of the
newly developing countries. While there are broad paradigms of
development, each country has had to find its own unique way to respond
to the imperatives of global capitalism. [The path of capitalist
modernisation is]{.underline} therefore [instantiated in different
cultures, following different trajectories and with different rhythms of
development.]{.underline}29 Uneven and combined development is the order
of the day.30 Progress is therefore not bound to a single European path,
but is instead filtered through a variety of political and cultural
constellations, all directed towards instantiating capitalist relations.
Today, modernisers simply fight over which variant of capitalism to
install. Recuperating the idea of progress under such circumstances
means, first and foremost, contesting the dogma of this inevitable
endpoint. [Capitalist modernity was never a necessary outcome, but
instead a successful project driven by various classes and a systemic
imperative towards accumulation and expansion. Various modernities are
possible, and new visions of the future are essential for the
left.]{.underline} Such images are [a necessary supplement to any
transformative political project. They give a direction to political
struggles and generate a set of criteria to adjudicate which struggles
to support, which movements to resist, what to invent, and so on. In the
absence of images of progress, there can only be]{.underline}
reactivity, defensive battles, local resistance and a bunker mentality
-- what we have characterised as [folk politics. Visions of the future
are therefore indispensable for elaborating a movement against
capitalism.]{.underline} Contra the earlier thinkers of modernity, there
is no necessity to progress, nor a singular pathway from which to
adjudicate the extent of development. Instead, [progress must be
understood as hyperstitional]{.underline}: as a kind of fiction, but one
that aims to transform itself into a truth. [Hyperstitions operate by
catalysing dispersed sentiment into a historical force that brings the
future into existence. They have the temporal form of 'will have been'.
Such hyperstitions of progress form orienting narratives with which to
navigate forward, rather than being an established or necessary property
of the world]{.underline}. Progress is a matter of political struggle,
following no pre-plotted trajectory or natural tendency, and with no
guarantee of success. If the supplanting of capitalism is impossible
from the standpoint of one or even many defensive stances, it is because
any form of prospective politics must set out to construct the new.
Pathways of progress must be cut and paved, not merely travelled along
in some pre-ordained fashion; they are a matter of political achievement
rather than divine or earthly providence. SUBVERSIVE UNIVERSALS Any
elaboration of an alternative image of progress must inevitably face up
to the problem of universalism -- the idea that certain values, ideas
and goals may hold across all cultures.31 Capitalism, as we have argued,
is an expansionary universal that weaves itself through multiple
cultural fabrics, reworking them as it goes along. Anything less than a
competing universal will end up being smothered by an all-embracing
series of capitalist relations.32 Various particularisms -- localised,
specific forms of politics and culture -- cohabitate with ease in the
world of capitalism. The list of possibilities continues to grow as
capitalism differentiates into Chinese capitalism, American capitalism,
Brazilian capitalism, Indian capitalism, Nigerian capitalism, and so on.
If [defending a particularism is insufficient]{.underline}, it is
because history shows us that [the global space of universalism is a
space of conflict, with each contender requiring the relative
provincialisation of its competitors]{.underline}.33 If the left is to
compete with global capitalism, it needs to rethink the project of
universalism. But to invoke such an idea is to call forth a number of
fundamental critiques directed against universalism in recent decades.
While a universal politics must move beyond any local struggles,
generalising itself at the global scale and across cultural variations,
it is for these very reasons that it has been criticised.34 As a matter
of historical record, [European modernity was inseparable from its 'dark
side' -- a vast network of exploited colonial dominions, the genocide of
indigenous peoples, the slave trade, and the plundering of colonised
nations' resources]{.underline}.35 In this conquest, [Europe presented
itself as embodying the universal way of life. All other peoples were
simply residual particulars that would inevitably come to be subsumed
under the European way -- even if this required ruthless physical
violence and cognitive assault]{.underline} to guarantee the outcome.
Linked to this was a belief that the universal was equivalent to the
homogeneous. Differences between cultures would therefore be erased in
the process of particulars being subsumed under the universal, creating
a culture modelled in the image of European civilisation. [This was a
universalism indistinguishable from pure chauvinism.]{.underline}
Throughout this process, Europe dissimulated its own parochial position
by deploying a series of mechanisms to efface the subjects who made
these claims -- white, heterosexual, property-owning males. Europe and
its intellectuals abstracted away from their location and identity,
presenting their claims as grounded in a 'view from nowhere'.36 This
perspective was taken to be untarnished by racial, sexual, national or
any other particularities, providing the basis for both the alleged
universality of Europe's claims and the illegitimacy of other
perspectives. While Europeans could speak and embody the universal,
other cultures could only be represented as particular and parochial.
Universalism has therefore been central to the worst aspects of
modernity's history. Given this heritage, [it might seem that the
simplest response would be to rescind the universal from our conceptual
arsenal. But, for all the difficulties with the idea, it nevertheless
remains necessary.]{.underline} The problem is partly that [one cannot
simply reject the concept of the universal without generating other
significant problems]{.underline}. Most notably, giving up on the
category leaves us with nothing but a series of diverse particulars.
There appears no way to build meaningful solidarity in the absence of
some common factor. The universal also operates as a transcendent ideal
-- never satisfied with any particular embodiment, and always open to
striving for better.37 It contains the conceptual impulse to undo its
own limits. Rejecting this category also risks Orientalising other
cultures, transforming them into an exotic Other. If there are only
particularisms, and provincial Europe is associated with reason,
science, progress and freedom, then the unpleasant implication is that
non-Western cultures must be devoid of these. The old Orientalist
divides are inadvertently sustained in the name of a misguided
anti-universalism. On the other hand, one risks licensing all sorts of
oppressions as simply the inevitable consequence of plural cultural
forms. All the problems of cultural relativism reappear if there are no
criteria to discern which global knowledges, politics and practices
support a politics of emancipation. Given all of this, it is
unsurprising to see aspects of universalism pop up throughout history
and across cultures,38 to see even its critics begrudgingly accept its
necessity,39 and to see a variety of attempts to revise the category.40
To maintain this necessary conceptual tool, the universal must be
identified not with an established set of principles and values, but
rather with an empty placeholder that is impossible to fill
definitively. Universals emerge when a particular comes to occupy this
position through hegemonic struggle:41 the particular ('Europe') comes
to represent itself as the universal ('global'). It is not simply a
false universal, though, as there is a mutual contamination: the
universal becomes embodied in the particular, while the particular loses
some of its specificities in functioning as the universal. Yet there can
never be a fully achieved universalism, and universals are therefore
always open to contestation from other universals. This is what we will
later outline in politico-strategic terms as [counter-hegemony -- a
project aimed at subverting an existing universalism in favour of a new
order. T]{.underline}his leads us to our second point -- [as
counter-hegemonic, universals can have a subversive and liberating
strategic function.]{.underline} On the one hand, a universal makes an
unconditional demand -- everything must be placed under its rule.42 Yet,
on the other hand, universalism is never an achieved project (even
capitalism remains incomplete). This tension renders any established
hegemonic structure open to contestation and enables universals to
function as insurrectionary vectors against exclusions. For example, the
concept of universal human rights, problematic as it may be, has been
put to use by numerous movements, ranging from local housing struggles
to international justice for war crimes. Its universal and unconditional
demand has been mobilised in order to highlight those who are left out
of its protections and rights. Similarly, feminists have criticised
certain concepts as exclusionary of women and mobilised universal claims
against their constraints, as in the use of the universal idea that 'all
humans are equal'. In such cases, the particular ('woman') becomes a way
to prosecute a critique against an existing universal ('humanity').
Meanwhile, the previously established universal ('humanity') becomes
revealed as a particular ('man').43 These examples show that universals
can be revitalised by the struggles that both challenge and elucidate
them. In this regard, 'to appeal to universalism as a way of asserting
the superiority of Western culture is to betray universality, but to
appeal to universalism as a way of dismantling the superiority of the
West is to realize it'.44 [Universalism]{.underline}, on this account,
[is the product of politics, not a transcendent judge standing above the
fray.]{.underline} We can turn now to one final aspect of universalism,
which is its heterogeneous nature.45 As capitalism makes clear,
universalism does not entail homogeneity -- it does not necessarily
involve converting diverse things into the same kind of thing. In fact,
[the power of capitalism is precisely its versatility in the face of
changing conditions on the ground and its capacity to accommodate
difference]{.underline}. A similar prospect must also hold for [any
leftist universal]{.underline} -- it [must be one that integrates
difference rather than erasing it]{.underline}. What then does all of
this mean for the project of modernity? It means that [any particular
image of modernity must be open to co-creation, and further
transformation and alteration.]{.underline} And in a globalised world
where different peoples necessarily co-exist, it means building systems
to live in common despite the plurality of ways of life. Contrary to
Eurocentric accounts and classic images of universalism, [it must
recognise the agency of those outside Europe, and the necessity of their
voices in building truly planetary and universal futures.]{.underline}
The universal, then, is [an empty placeholder that hegemonic
particulars]{.underline} (specific demands, ideals and collectives)
[come to occupy.]{.underline} It can operate as [a subversive and
emancipatory vector of change with respect to established
universalisms]{.underline}, and it [is heterogeneous and includes
differences, rather than eliminating them.]{.underline}

#### Tag- synthetic freedom

**Srnicek and Williams 15** \[Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, tag teamed
Badiou one time, *Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World
Without Work*, 2015, //Stefan\]

While the left has traditionally been associated with ideals of equality
(manifested today in the focus on income and wealth inequalities), we
believe that [freedom is an]{.underline} equally [essential principle of
left modernity.]{.underline} This concept has been central to the
political battles fought throughout the twentieth century, with the
United States routinely posing as 'the free world' against a
totalitarian enemy (in the figure of the USSR, and then the increasingly
incoherent images of 'Islamofascism'). In these hegemonic battles,
[capitalism has repeatedly asserted its superiority by]{.underline}
upholding an idea of negative [freedom]{.underline}.46 This is [the
freedom of individuals from arbitrary interference by other individuals,
collectives and institutions]{.underline} [(paradigmatically, the
state). Negative freedom's insistence on the absence of interference has
made it an ideal tool to wield against purportedly totalitarian
opponents,]{.underline} yet [it is a woefully emaciated concept of
freedom]{.underline}. In practice[, it translates into a modicum of
political freedom from the state (ever less so in an age of digital
spying and the war on terror) and the economic freedoms to sell our
labour power and to choose between shiny new consumer
goods]{.underline}.47 Under negative freedom, [the rich and the poor are
considered equally free, despite the obvious differences in their
capacities to act]{.underline}.48 [Negative freedom is entirely
compatible with mass poverty, starvation, homelessness, unemployment and
inequality. It is also entirely compatible with our desires being
manufactured and designed by pervasive advertising]{.underline}. Against
this limited concept of freedom[, we argue for a much more substantial
version.]{.underline} Whereas negative freedom is concerned with
assuring the formal right to avoid interference, '[synthetic freedom'
recognises that a formal right without a material capacity is
worthless.]{.underline}49 Under a democracy, for example, we are all
formally free to run for political leadership. But without the financial
and social resources to run a campaign, this is a meaningless freedom.
Equally, we are all formally free to not take a job, but most of us are
nevertheless practically forced into accepting whatever is on offer.50
In either case, various options may be theoretically available, but for
all practical purposes are off the table. This reveals the significance
of having the means to realise a formal right, and it is this emphasis
on the means and capacities to act that is crucial for a leftist
approach to freedom. As Marx and Engels wrote, 'it is possible to
achieve real liberation only in the real world and by real means'.51
Understood in this way, [freedom and power become intertwined. If power
is the basic capacity to produce intended effects in someone or
something else,]{.underline}52 [then an increase in our ability to carry
out our desires is simultaneously an increase in our freedom. The more
capacity we have to act, the freer we are. One of the biggest
indictments of capitalism is that it enables the freedom to act for only
a vanishingly small few. A primary aim of a postcapitalist world would
therefore be to maximise synthetic freedom, or in other words, to enable
the flourishing of all of humanity and the expansion of our collective
horizons]{.underline}.53 Achieving this involvesat least three different
elements: the [provision of the basic necessities of life]{.underline},
the [expansion of social resources]{.underline}, and the [development of
technological capacities]{.underline}.54 Taken together, these form [a
synthetic freedom that is constructed rather than natural, a collective
historical achievement]{.underline} rather than the result of simply
leaving people be. Emancipation is thus not about detaching from the
world and liberating a free soul, but instead [a matter of constructing
and cultivating the right attachments]{.underline}. In the first place,
synthetic freedom entails the maximal provision of the basic resources
needed for a meaningful life: things like income, time, health and
education. Without these resources, most people are left formally but
not really free. Understood in this way, rising global inequality is
revealed as an equally massive disparity in freedom. One initial step in
resolving this is the classic social democratic goal of providing the
common goods of society, such as healthcare, housing, childcare,
education, transport and internet access.55 The liberal idea in which
these basic necessities of life are supposedly enhanced by freedom of
choice in the market ignores the actual (financial and cognitive)
burdens involved in making such choices.56 In a world of synthetic
freedom, [high-quality public goods would be provided for us, leaving us
to get on with our lives rather than worrying about which healthcare
provider to go with.]{.underline} Beyond the social democratic
imagination, however, lie two further essentials of existence: time and
money. [Free time is the basic condition for self-determination and the
development of our capacities.]{.underline}57 Equally, [synthetic
freedom demands the provision of a basic income to all in order for them
to be fully free]{.underline}.58 Such a policy not only provides the
monetary resources for living under capitalism, but also makes possible
an increase in free time. It provides us with the capacity to choose our
lives: [we can experiment and build unconventional lives, choosing to
foster our cultural, intellectual and physical sensibilities instead of
blindly working to survive.]{.underline}59 Time and money therefore
represent key components of freedom in any substantive sense. A full
image of synthetic freedom must also seek to expand our capacities
beyond what is currently possible. If it is to avoid the problem of
manipulating people into contentment with the status quo, synthetic
freedom must be open to whatever people might desire.60 That is to say,
[freedom cannot simply be equated with making existing options viable,
but instead must be open to the largest possible set of
options.]{.underline} In this, [collective resources are
essential]{.underline}.61 Processes of social reasoning, for instance,
can enable common understandings of the world, creating a 'we' in the
process that has much greater powers to act than individuals alone.62
Equally, [language is effectively cognitive scaffolding that enables us
to leverage symbolic thought to expand our horizons]{.underline}.63 The
development, deepening and expansion of knowledge enable us to imagine
and achieve capacities that are otherwise unattainable. [As we acquire
technical knowledge of our built environment and scientific knowledge of
the natural world, and come to understand the fluid tendencies of the
social world, we gain greater powers to act.]{.underline} As Louis
Althusser put it, Just as knowledge of the laws of light has never
prevented men from seeing ... so knowledge of the laws that govern the
development of societies does not prevent men from living, or take the
place of labour, love and struggle. On the contrary: knowledge of the
laws of light has produced the glasses which have transformed men's
sight, just as knowledge of the laws of social development has given
rise to endeavours which have transformed and enlarged the horizon of
human existence.64 [The anti-intellectualism that permeates the
political right, and increasingly infects the critical left, is
therefore a retrogression of the worst kind]{.underline}. Healthy
scepticism is transformed into an abdication of our commitments to
expand freedom. [This retrogression]{.underline} in relation to
knowledge [also occurs in the fantasies of immediate and unbound
freedoms in practice.]{.underline} The voluntaristic image that sees
mediations, institutions and abstractions as opposed to freedom simply
confuses the absence of artifice with the full expression of freedom.
Needless to say, this is misguided. [Collective action, with its
expansion of synthetic freedom, is more often than not carried out
through complex divisions of labour, mediated chains of engagement and
abstract institutional structures. The social aspect of synthetic
freedom is therefore not a return to some human desire for face-to-face
sociality and simple cooperation, but instead a call for collective,
complex and mediated self-determination]{.underline}. Finally, if we are
to expand our capacities to act, [the development of technology must
play a central role.]{.underline} As has always been the case,
'technology is the source of our options \[and\] options are the basis
of a future that keeps us above the level of pawn'.65 [Our level of
freedom is highly dependent upon the historical conditions of scientific
and technological development]{.underline}.66 The [artifices that emerge
from these fields both expand existing capacities for action and create
entirely new ones in the process. The full development of synthetic
freedom therefore requires a reconfiguration of the material world in
accordance with the drive to expand our capacities for
action.]{.underline} It demands [experimentation with collective and
technological augmentation]{.underline}, and [a spirit that refuses to
accept any barrier as natural and inevitable.]{.underline}67 Cyborg
augmentations, artificial life, synthetic biology and technologically
mediated reproduction are all examples of this elaboration.68 The
overall aim must therefore be picked out as [an unrelenting project to
unbind the necessities of this world and transform them into materials
for the further construction of freedom]{.underline}.69 [Such an image
of emancipation can never be satisfied with or condensed into a static
society, but will instead continually strain beyond any limitations.
Freedom is a synthetic enterprise, not a natural gift.]{.underline}
Underlying this idea of emancipation is [a vision of humanity as a
transformative and constructible hypothesis: one that is built through
theoretical and practical experimentation and
elaboration]{.underline}.70 There is [no authentic human essence to be
realised, no harmonious unity to be returned to, no unalienated humanity
obscured by false mediations, no organic wholeness to be achieved.
Alienation is a mode of enablement, and humanity is an incomplete vector
of transformation. What we are and what we can become are open-ended
projects to be constructed in the course of time]{.underline}. As Sadie
Plant puts it, It's always been problematic to talk about the liberation
of women because that presupposes that we know what women are. If both
women and men have been organised into the forms we currently take, then
we don't want to liberate what we are now, if you see what I mean ...
It's not a question of liberation so much as a question of evolution --
or engineering. There's a gradual re-engineering of what it can be to be
a woman and we don't yet know what it is. We have to find out.71 [What
must therefore be articulated is a humanism that is not defined in
advance.]{.underline} This is [a project of
self-realisation]{.underline}, but one [without a pre-established
endpoint]{.underline}.72 It is only through undergoing the process of
revision and construction that humanity can come to know itself. This
means [revising the human both theoretically and practically, engaging
in new modes of being and new forms of sociality as practical
ramifications of making 'the human' explicit.]{.underline}73 It is [to
undertake an interventionist approach to the human that is opposed to
those humanisms that protect a parochial image of the human at all
costs.]{.underline}74 These interventions range from individual bodily
experimentation to collective political mobilisations against restricted
images of the human, and everything in between.75 It means [liberating
ourselves from the decrepit economic image of humanity that capitalist
modernity has installed, and inventing a new humanity. Emancipation,
under this vision, would therefore mean increasing the capacity of
humanity to act according to whatever its desires might become. And
universal emancipation would be the insistent and maximal extension of
this goal to the entirety of our species]{.underline}. It is in this
sense that [universal emancipation lies at the heart of a modern
left.]{.underline}76 We have seen that, without a conception of the
future, the left becomes bound to a defence of tradition, and to
protecting bunkers of resistance. [What]{.underline}, then, w[ould a
left modernity look like? It would be one that offered enticing and
expansive visions of a better future. It would operate with a universal
horizon, mobilise a substantial concept of freedom, and make use of the
most advanced technologies in order to achieve its emancipatory goals.
Rather than a Eurocentric view of the future, it would rely upon a
global set of voices articulating and negotiating in practice what a
common and plural future might be. Whether operating through slave
revolts, workers' struggles, anti-colonial uprisings or women's
movements, the critics of sedimented universalisms have always been
essential agents in modernity's construction of the future; they are the
ones who have continually revised, revolted and created a 'universalism
from below']{.underline}.77 Yet [to truly enable the liberation of
futures in the plural, the current global order premised on waged labour
and capitalist accumulation will need to be transcended first. A left
modernity will, in other words, require building a postcapitalist and
post-work platform upon which multiple ways of living could emerge and
flourish.]{.underline} The next two chapters will set out both the
necessity and desirability of this particular vision of the future.

#### Here's our thesis: that the 1AC's attempt at arms control paradoxically increases the production of arms by aiding in the very same innovation that allows the system to propel itself further into the realm of pure computation

The theoretical and practical capacity to make the difference between
fact and law constitutes what Kant called reason.26 This is [why law is
ruined by the proletarianization of the life of the mind and spirit as a
whole]{.underline} -- which can lead only to barbarism. There is no
doubt that [this is now clearly taking place, as drones combine with and
utilize 'big data' in the service of the automatic detection of
'suspects', that is, people whose behaviour corresponds, according to
statistically calculated correlations, to that of potential terrorists,
whom these new automatic weapons, drones, can then eliminate,
perpetrating a state violence that, adhering to no law of war, diffuses
the lawlessness of a deterritorialized and blind automatic
police.]{.underline} As Grégoire Chamayou observes: The modern art of
tracking is based on an intensive use of new technologies, combining
aerial video surveillance, the interception of signals, and cartographic
tracking. \[...\] In this model the enemy individual is no longer seen
as a link in a hierarchical chain of command: he is a knot or 'node'
inserted into a number of social networks. \[...\] \[T\]he idea is that
by successfully targeting its key 'nodes', an enemy network can be
disorganized to the point of being practically wiped out. \[...\] This
claim to predictive calculation is the foundation of the policy of
prophylactic elimination, for which the hunter-killer drones are the
main instruments. \[...\] In the [logic of]{.underline} this [security,
based on the preventive elimination of dangerous individuals, 'warfare'
takes the form of vast campaigns of extra-judiciary
executions]{.underline}.27 In relation to the current use of drones in
Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, Chamayou quotes Mary Ellen O'Connell: '
"International law does not recognize the right to kill with battlefield
weapons outside an actual armed conflict. [The so-called 'global war on
terror' is not an armed conflict."]{.underline} These strikes therefore
constitute grave violations of the laws of war.'28 The thesis of [the
end of theory and the obsolescence of science]{.underline} proclaimed by
[Anderson is the counterpart of this liquidation of law by these new
forms of automatic weapon.]{.underline}29 [This liquidation of law is in
turn directly tied to the elimination of sacrifice -- without which
there can be no warrior, and through which the conquering soldier
receives his greater share]{.underline} \[solde\]: he is in principle
glorious. His life, steeped in the test of mortal combat, is also, and,
according to Hegel, firstly, one that knows consistence (this is the
issue in the first moment of the master/slave dialectic in the
Phenomenology of Spirit).30Knowledge too, however, presupposes the
capacity for self-sacrifice, no longer just the death that covers one in
glory but an intermittent noetic sacrifice and a wrenching away that
confers, like death, what the Greeks called kleos (of which the
contemporary wish to be 'known', to have a reputation, which social
networks claim to provide for their contributors, is the disintegrated
version -- a disintegration of the transindividuation networks
themselves to the benefit of the 'reputation' of advertisers). The
experience of knowledge is the experience of what, in this knowledge,
teaches, through being learned, the history of [the 'deaths' and
'rebirths' of knowledge. Knowledge is par excellence what, opening
knowing to what is not yet known, 'kills off' what had hitherto been
considered knowledge -- yet in this, and with the death of what had
hitherto been considered knowledge, knowledge finds itself
reborn]{.underline}, in the course of what was described by Socrates (in
Meno) as an anamnesis,31 and by Husserl (in 'The Origin of Geometry') as
a reactivation,32 which is the individuation of knowledge through the
individuation of the knower. We shall see in Automatic Society, Volume
2: The Future of Knowledge that what we are here metaphorically calling
the 'death' and 'rebirth' of knowledge refers to the acquisition of
knowledge as automatization and to its rebirth as dis-automatization. As
for [full automatization, made possible by digital tertiary retention
through the integration of all automatisms and by short-circuiting all
therapeutic possibilities for dis-automatization, it disintegrates in
the field of battle as in the epistemic field this dual sacrificial
experience of the struggle for freedom]{.underline} and the struggle
against what is in itself, and not for itself, as Hegel said -- as what
prevents, as 'well known', the expression of what remains to come for
the self and as its for itself (these are Hegel\'s terms). Full
automatization effects this disintegration, at once and in the same
movement, for both warriors and scientists. According to Anderson[, this
disintegration foreshadows the death of the scientist by proclaiming the
end of science in a world where the 'scholar', who has been
proletarianized]{.underline} just as has Alan Greenspan, no longer
fights for anything or knows anything. He or she no longer fights for
any consistence, or against any inconsistence: he or she no longer knows
anything consistent.33 Such is the price of [total
nihilism]{.underline}, of [nihilistic totalization, of the
disintegration in which consists the accomplished nihilism that is
totally computational capitalism, in which there is no longer anything
worth anything -- since everything has become calculable.]{.underline}

#### More thesis- this card is pretty fuego as well

It is this [state of law]{.underline} that [has been liquidated by the
neoliberalism of the conservative revolution]{.underline}, and [it has
done so in order to restore a state of fact and to improve a rate of
profit that by the early 1970s was in significant
decline]{.underline}.90 [This restoration was imposed in order to create
a global economic war between nations, a war called globalization -- and
it was effected by exploiting the audiovisual media, which have
themselves been globalized.]{.underline} In the preceding period, these
'industries of the imaginary', as they were called by Patrice Flichy,91
constituted an industry of dreams in the service of capital: Hollywood,
factory of dreams. The neoconservative and ultra-liberal turn creates an
industry of bad dreams and nightmares by systematically exploiting the
drives -- and the destructive drives -- which can no longer be bound by
desire. Then, starting in 1993 with digital reticulation, and after the
final collapse of the Eastern bloc, [the 'old-fashioned' conservative
revolution makes way for an ultra-liberal libertarianism]{.underline} 92
[that exploits mimetism, exhibitionism and voyeurism via a digital media
that forms new artificial crowds, but that also constitutes a laboratory
of new forms of individuation, which arise as alternatives to
disindividuating consumerism and which make the critique of new
conservatism highly complex]{.underline}. During this time, however,
[creative destruction turns into destructive destruction, something that
becomes visible]{.underline}, even if it does not become totally clear
(far from it), [with the crisis of 2008.]{.underline} And it is as an
alternative to the exhausted consumerist model that the data economy and
more generally the 'iconomy' (as Michel Volle calls it93) is imposed on
the basis of a new shock caused by the appearance of the web -- leading,
with social networking and big data, to the dissolution of everyday life
via the automatized grammatization of existences. Marc Giget has shown
that the first question raised by this economy, which awaits its state
of law, is another state of fact -- one that accompanies that state of
fact which Anderson claims is insurmountable, in terms of the 'end of
theory'. This other state of fact is largely occluded inFrance: the fact
that the destruction of employment by the digital seems in this economy
to always be more important than the creation of new jobs.94 It is
starting from this question that [we must critique the 'storytelling' of
the permanent transition. This story assumes that the model of creative
destruction could continue to infinity, which is absolutely false, not
only because the finitude of resources clearly constrains
'growth']{.underline} (which is the current name for 'creative
destruction'), not only because it produces negative externalities that
are ever more costly and toxic for the entire system, but also because,
in addition to the speculative pressure on purchasing power exerted
since the 1980s that ultimately led to the subprime mortgage system, it
is now destroying the functional pair 'employment/purchasing power',
that is, production/consumption. It is difficult to decide whether Crary
himself takes seriously the auto-suggestive and self-fulfilling fable of
permanent transition -- as he seems to suggest when he writes that
'there never will be a "catching up" on either a social or individual
basis in relation to continually changing technological requirements'95
-- or if, on the contrary, he denounces it. If what he is saying here is
that technics will always continue to individuate, or (and for us this
is the same thing) that the de-phasing of the noetic soul that is the
psychic individual\'s phase shift with itself (which for Simondon
constitutes the dynamic of psychic individuation) lies in its
individuating itself collectively, and in the fact that this collective
is organologically and therefore technically constituted, and that
[technical individuation is what leads to the resolution of phase shifts
only at the cost of instigating new phase shifts]{.underline},96 and
that individuation is thus always in relative transition, that is, in
metastable equilibrium (hence in relative disequilibrium) -- if he is
saying all this, then we can only agree. But if he is suggesting that
this individuation will always and forever run counter to psychic
individuation and counter to social individuation, then we must
disagree: such a becoming (which would be [the linear extension of the
current curve of technological innovation qua destructive destruction)
is inevitably self-destructive because technical individuation can
continue only with psychic and collective individuation -- and it is at
present destructive in the very short term, and not just on the
environmental and mental planes, but also on the economic plane. Failing
the occurrence of a historical bifurcation, it will become militarily
self-destructive -- 'big data' being designed for the purpose of
dataveillance in relation not just to marketing but also to military
'intelligence', whose endpoints now include drones as well as
missiles.]{.underline} [The fable of permanent transition would have us
believe that a constant, accelerated transformation of the world by
technological innovation, itself controlled by speculative marketing, is
unavoidable. It would have us believe that there is no alternative. To
oppose this fable is to affirm that we are indeed living through a
transition -- which can be understood on the basis of the metaphor of
'metamorphosis' as the appearance of new somatopsychic, technical and
social forms and organizations -- but that this is not merely a
technological transition]{.underline} (firstly because nothing is ever
merely technological), [and is instead an organological chrysalis in
three dimensions constituting three correlated individuations, that is,
occurring through a process of psychic, technical and social
transindividuation, even though there are conflicts between and within
these three dimensions. It is a question of knowing what exactly is in
transition.]{.underline} And more precisely it is a matter of knowing to
which processes of individuation one is referring. To investigate this
question, the organological approach analyses the evolution of the
transductive relations that connect the somaticorgans, artificial organs
and social organizations, these organs being formed through these
relations and through their evolution, so that they are constituted by
what Simondon called transductive amplifications.97

#### Academic knowledge production is quite bad

**Hoofd 16** \[Ingrid Hoofd, Assistant Professor in the Department of
Media and Culture at Utrecht University, *Higher Education and
Technological Acceleration: The Disintegration of University Teaching
and Research*, November 2016, //Stefan\]

So to reiterate, the radical proposition of this book is that [the prime
mission or ideals of the university---namely those of total
emancipation, freedom, and the goals of knowledge accumulation---are
precisely what currently produce exceedingly unjust practices 'outside'
and 'within' academia.]{.underline} These [unjust practices that it
produces on its 'outside' concern those of the ongoing social
stratification via so-called meritocratic education and those of
sociological, computational, and psychological objectification of ever
more cultures and groups, while the unjust practices on its 'inside'
concern those of internal hierarchies, rankings, divisions, gatekeeping
mechanisms, and exclusions of all kinds]{.underline}. And because the
reproduction of its practices at base involve modern techniques and
technologies of knowing, this book suggests that rather than arguing for
a return to the supposedly 'walled' university, however sympathetic,
gaining a better understanding of the intersection of this problematic
with especially modern technologies of communication, visibility, or
calculation is crucial to really thinking the modern university project
differently. The book therefore argues [that the central problem of the
university today consists of the acceleration of academia's unfinishable
ideals by way of an enmeshment with techniques and technologies of
communication, calculation, and prediction. The quest for transcendence
through technologically aided omniscience and universal
connection]{.underline}---after all, the term 'university' comes from
the Latin universitas or the 'totality' or 'total community'---has
resulted in the quest to render everything and everyone transparent and
understandable. As I will discuss more in depth through the work of
techno-pundit Paul Virilio, [the current university and its new forms of
violence are therefore an outflow or intensification of 'outdated'
humanist ideals and techniques, whose internal contradictions have
become usurped and constantly remobilised by neo-liberal capitalism and
its machinery of acceleration]{.underline}. We see the auto-immune
aspect returning here as well, since that [contemporary machinery of the
acceleration of omniscience in many of its aspects---]{.underline}one
need only to think of early cybernetic research, innovations like the
Arpanet, and engineeringoriented models of communication as noise
cancellation---[has again also been carried out at least in large part
by universities]{.underline} (disturbingly [often with the help of
military monies and establishments]{.underline}, about the significance
of which more later). In other words, [the hopeful academic project of
'exposing the world and humanity to the light of truth and
emancipation,' together with its damaging 'evil twins' of oppressive
universalism, social submission, surveillance, and colonialism, has
caved in onto themselves and become a near-pervasive technologically
'exposing-itself' of a fundamentally Janus-faced academia]{.underline}.
This is also to stress that the ways in which [academic research has
historically been part of Western imperialism]{.underline} should be
considered more closely when critically examining the faux-nostalgic
calls in many contemporary European universities for a 'return' to
presumed 'research autonomy,' as well as when analysing the kinds of
seemingly perverse 'knowledge-as- capital' arguments made by
contemporary universities in the post-colonies. I will provide divergent
examples from the Netherlands and Singapore of such tendencies in Chaps.
2 , 3 , and 4 . In light of the above, this book therefore also wants to
[discuss the relationship or interaction between academia and modern
technology as consisting of a more fundamentally entangled apparatus
than most critics of the neo-liberalisation of higher education, who see
such technology as merely applied onto academia from the 'outside' or as
mere tools for use on the 'inside' consider it to be]{.underline}. As an
example, Ward in Neoliberalism and the Global Restructuring of Knowledge
and Education certainly rightly claims that the [digital knowledge
economy, due to the translation of information into bits and bytes, has
forced a quantification of performance indicators in academia, leading
to the erasure and transformation of certain kinds of
knowledge]{.underline} in the 'hard' as well as the 'soft' sciences
(2012, 126). Especially the humanities, says Ward, with their forms and
media of knowledge (like the monograph) that cannot be reduced to sheer
numbers, be disaggregated into sellable pieces, or be made to follow the
impetus of fast-paced output, suffer from this quantification (2012,
127). While I agree with Ward on this aspect of digitalisation, he does
not seem to consider the fact [that the origins of these technologies as
such]{.underline}, as I mentioned earlier, [not only stem from
university research, but also that the supposedly empowering qualities
of technologies of communication and visualisation have in fact always
been part of the university setup from its inception]{.underline} in the
late Medieval era and the early Enlightenment in Europe---one may here
think, for example, of René Descartes' mechanistic view of the material
world, the crucial importance of inventions like the telescope and
microscope, or the ways in which the dissemination of scientific ideas
relied on book printing technology. It appears then that [the basic
imbrication of academia with media technologies is one of a continuous
and ever-growing constitutional yet dialectical relationship, in which
these technologies eventually turn out to be much more than simply a
means through which research and teaching are carried out]{.underline}.
Instead, due to their constitutive enmeshment with academia's
auto-immunity[, they paradoxically expose themselves as facilitators as
well as thwarters of the academic ideal of total knowledge]{.underline}.
Rather, the ideal of exposition and omniscience, and the ways it is
today carried out through modern data- driven technologies and visual
media aids, is, this book argues, itself just as ambiguous and finally
ungraspable (as their borders likewise cannot be pinned down) as the
nature of academia as such. The book also hopes to demonstrate that in
light of this, [the central logic of the university today, as a logical
yet paradoxical outflow of the ambiguity of such techniques of
exposition and transparency, currently consists above all in a pervasive
'stealth' functionality or unknown quality]{.underline}. This is because
especially [the cybernetic technologies that constitute the core
techniques of teaching and research today]{.underline}, as I will
discuss later on in this chapter, [fundamentally rely on obscuring their
own operations.]{.underline} This in turn segues into the problem that
[the contemporary university ever more successfully hides its internally
oppressive operations in favour of a false image of university
'objectivity' and of it 'being at the forefront' of knowledge,
transparency, emancipation, and truth. This 'stealth' functionality is,
moreover, intimately connected to the militaristic logic that inhabits
contemporary digital technology,]{.underline} whose implications
regarding the university this chapter will explore especially via the
work of Virilio on science, technology, and vision. Due to this stealth
logic of accelerated transparency, [a stifling 'productivist'
principle]{.underline}---a term coined by Jean Baudrillard, about whom
more later too, in his The Mirror of Production that seeks to expose a
highly ideological idea of the human as an essentially productive or
creative agent---reigns in most contemporary universities, relegating
everything or anyone that does not comply with this logic as not merely
undesirable but also utterly incomprehensible, as some of us in the
humanities or theoretical sciences can attest to. It is this situation
that logically gives rise to aggravated tensions and schizoid
experiences among university staff and students; but it is also this
situation that finally allows this book to expose its hypocrisy. [The
irreducible unknown quality of the university, in the form of a sort of
libidinal antagonism, then pops up with a vengeance in a time where one
would least expect it.]{.underline} Such is the essence of managerialism
after all; guided by a principle that resides inside itself, it will
only strengthen this principle whenever it wants to banish it more
forcefully. Eventually then, the book proposes that [the instabilities,
inconsistencies, and ambiguities generated through this technological
acceleration also present an inappropriable possibility and a promise of
a radically alternative future by way of tracing academia's constitutive
contradictions and injustices, which have led to it becoming its own
fatality]{.underline}. The book thus wants to make an argument for
academic writing and engagement that remains 'fatally' speculative,
enigmatic, and opaque (perhaps especially in the hard sciences), so as
to mount a polemical provocation that remains beyond the tyranny of a
total transparency feared by Virilio. This strategy---if one could call
it that---seeks to extend Baudrillard's insistence of mobilising a much
more 'fatal' radical theory in order to make a structural difference.
But before we arrive there, we must first take a closer look at how this
humanist aporia expresses itself in those texts that have theorised the
transformation of the university in recent decades and that reside
arguably closest to the 'source' of its crisis: the critical humanities.
The value of looking at such critical work in detail, besides these
works providing excellent descriptions of recent academic
transformations, resides in the fact that they deal with the crises and
paradoxes of the university also on the level of their own rhetoric, and
thus tend to explicitly display the struggles, tensions, and
contradictions at the heart of academic 8 enquiry and writing. [The
exacerbation of the university's auto-immunity can]{.underline}
therefore, I suggest, [be conceptually, geographically,
paradigmatically, and historically located in and via these
works.]{.underline}

#### Impact card- knowledge production and the Neganthropocene

**Stiegler 17** \[Bernard Stiegler, heads the Department of Cultural
Development at the Pompidou Center in Paris, *Automatic Society Volume
1: The Future of Work*, January 2017, //Stefan\]

Clearly [a transition is underway]{.underline}, and it is [between two
industrial models: consumerism, founded on Taylorism, the culture
industries]{.underline} (as described by Adorno) [and the welfare state
designed to directly and indirectly redistribute productivity gains in
the form of the wages of employees who are not just producers but
consumers]{.underline}, that is, equipped with purchasing power; [a
fully automatized society where employment has disappeared, and hence
where wages are no longer the source of purchasing power, in turn
implying the disappearance of the producer/consumer,]{.underline} which
clearly requires [the institution of a new process of redistribution --
redistributing not purchasing power, but time: the time to constitute
forms of knowledge]{.underline} (including purchasing knowledge, that
is, knowledge of social practices governing use values and exchange
values according to practical values and societal values). Knowledge
takes time. It takes nighttime to sleep and dream, and daytime to think,
reflect and act by determining the contents of good and bad nightdreams
and daydreams in order to materialize and transmit them and to receive
them from others, and also to struggle: to learn what results from
dreams and reveries, the reflections, theories and inventions of others.
It takes time to confront the time of realized and de-realized dreams,
time perhaps for what the Australian Aborigines called 'Dreaming': time
to deliberate and decide, by inscribing oneself in new circuits of
transindividuation formed by these dreams, and by pursuing them through
bifurcations that dis-automatize them. This transition, which is also a
specific time of intermittence, if it is to lead positively to its end,
requires the supplementary invention of a political organology, given
that what is at stake and what is emerging at the end of this
'metamorphosis' is another social organization supported by new digital
organs -- producing a new 'technical system' in Bertrand Gille\'s
sense.98 [The origin of this metamorphosis lies in the initial shock of
this transition, which must be socialized and configured through a new
social organization, itself transindividuated through therapeutic
invention and stimulated by the new pharmakon.]{.underline} There are
technological transformations, and among them, some provoke changes of
the technical system. This is the case with digital technology. And
among the changes of the technical system, some provoke civilizational
change: this was the case for writing by hand and for printing, and it
is clearly also the case for the digital technical system. But when this
kind of transformation occurs, it in fact gives rise to a new form of
human life, as happened in the epoch of the Upper Palaeolithic and then
the Neolithic[. A transformation of this magnitude is telluric in the
sense that, shifting the soil on which the most solid and most ancient
edifices have been built, it overturns every aspect of the foundations
of life, and not just of the life of human beings]{.underline}. It is a
transformation of this magnitude, so extraordinary that it seems to go
beyond the limits of History and Proto-History, that we refer to as the
Anthropocene. [What is at stake in the new social organization that we
must dream, conceive and realize -- that is, establish and institute as
the therapeia of the new pharmakon -- is the time of knowledge that can
and must be gained by and through automatization, time that it is a
question of redistributing]{.underline}. To do so we must make an exit
from Taylorism, Keynesianism and consumerism by organizing the economy
and society differently, including the elaboration and transmission of
knowledge itself. And achieving this requires a supplementary invention
leading to a categorial invention, that is, to a fundamental epistemic
change itself opening onto a reinvention of academic institutions as
well as the editorial and publishing industry.99 [To anticipate and
prepare this, that is, to mobilize and form the social forces capable of
bearing and inventing it, we must anticipate the new shock that will
soon happen -- and that will be extremely brutal, because it bears
within it the end of employment]{.underline}. We must engage resolutely
and without delay in the social change called for by the current period
of transition that passes through this new technological shock of
generalized automatization and therefore of robotization. [The mutation
of the conditions of production currently underway means that the exit
from the industrial world founded on employment and redistribution via
wages is going to occur no matter what. Failure to anticipate and
negotiate this change will only provoke an explosion of
violence.]{.underline} Either generalized automatization -- the effects
of which are being felt in all dimensions of existence and in all
sectors of the economy, dis-integrating the one (existence) as well as
the other (the economy) -- will occur through the sheer force of fact,
unleashing a clash of particular and national interests, or it will lead
to the establishment of a new state of law that must become the object
of a global negotiation at all local levels and as the constitution of
what, borrowing a term from Mauss, we call the internation.100 It is the
absolute role and interest and the urgent priority of Europe to advocate
for this other path at the level of the international organizations that
are the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World
Trade Organization, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
but also within the World Wide Web Consortium. Before examining this
subject in greater detail, which is the heart of this book, and before
further analysing, from the perspective of a government of the future,
the concept of algorithmic governmentality that describes the general
framework within which the conditions of shock have been set in place,
we should recall some elementary principles with respect to the
technical evolution of noetic life, in order to analyse the functional
possibilities of articulating the evolutions of technics with the time
of dreaming. [The algorithmic governmentality imposed by computational
24/7 capitalism will become an automatic society (rather than a
'dis-society') only if it makes technics serve arrangements between the
times of intermittence and the times submitted to subsistence, between
automatisms and their dis-automatization, the latter projecting
consistences. In a society where knowledge becomes the primary
productive]{.underline} [function]{.underline} (and the first if not the
only one to have seen this was Marx), [the new value that will re-found
the economy and politics will no longer be the time of employment, but
the time of knowledge, that is, negentropy, constituting a neganthropy
and opening the age of the Neganthropocene.]{.underline}

#### You should endorse the framework that best overcorrects for the compulsory optimism of the university

If we are to take this brief moment of self-reflexivity in his text
seriously, we might likewise read the argument in The Postmodern
Condition as being itself symptomatic of the false divisions that our
postmodern universities give rise to, namely that mythical division
between power and knowledge, or a concern with marketability vis-à-vis a
concern with truth. Reading Lyotard in this way, one could conclude that
the so-called decline of grand narratives that Lyotard so famously
pronounces may then only be a superficial effect of [a knowledge society
in which]{.underline} those [grand narratives have not at all
disappeared, but that have instead sublimated or transformed into the
technologically aided goals of efficiency and
predictability]{.underline}. It is therefore perhaps the way (and I am
of course speculating here as well) in which Lyotard in The Postmodern
Condition seems compelled in the final analysis to perform [an optimism
around science and philosophy]{.underline} via an apocalyptic indictment
of cybernetic mechanisms---a move, as we will see in the next chapter,
very similar to Heidegger's argument regarding modern technology---that
really [constitutes the central problematic of the contemporary
university. This also means that the critical humanities, for all their
being chided for their 'negativity' or 'uselessness,' actually provide
the hope for a qualitatively better future that remains imperative to
the sustenance of the scientific project and all its negative fallout
via the accelerated techniques of destruction and
oppression.]{.underline} What is more, if such a reading can reveal that
optimism is a driving force of Lyotard's piece, then that must mean that
my book, and the ways in which it productively engages the tensions
within the neoliberal universities in which it was written over the
course of a few years with the help of all kinds of cybernetic tools so
as to suggest the above analysis, revolves around that optimism too.
[The grand narratives of truth and emancipation have then not been
abandoned at all; they rather are now nearly everywhere, in the very
oppressive and enabling machinery that surrounds us as academics and
social beings on a daily basis. We find ourselves ever more surrounded
by the suffocating 'curse' of social and scientific progress, forever
forced to empower ourselves and incessantly dig for the 'truth' around
increasingly confusing piles of information. The goal of total knowledge
seems closer to us than ever, yet at the same time seems to slip ever
further away from us.]{.underline} This sentiment, that we are not by
far out of the ideals that the university historically has bestowed upon
us but that these are also being displaced, is also brought up by
Jacques Derrida's "Mochlos; or, the Confl ict of the Faculties" when he
exclaims "The university, what an idea! It is a relatively recent idea.
We have yet to escape it, and it is already being reduced to its own
archive ..." (1992, 1). I am presenting a brief discussion of Derrida's
point here to further illuminate the aporia at the heart of the
university by someone who at the same time seems keenly aware of the
very problem of 'illumination' (an unresolvable tension my book also
shuttles between). The Greek term 'mochlos' (μοχλός) in the title
translates as 'lever' or 'keystone,' and Derrida's clever title
therefore already implies, as Dittrich also suggested, that there
apparently resides a "confl ict" at the heart of the idea of the
university that also constitutes its central mechanism. Derrida's
suggestion nonetheless also immediately dispels the traps of romanticism
or nostalgia regarding the function or responsibility of the university
in the past or as such. This is because he stresses that that conflict,
"breach," or internal incoherence (1992, 7) has always been somehow
present in various more or less violent forms---the institutionalisation
of the classic Bildungsideal being one of them---while such idealistic
representations like Von Humboldt's simultaneously functioned as a cover
for the university's essential impurity. But such an obfuscation,
suggests Derrida, cannot last, as [the university is just as much one of
a universal uncovering or transparency; its quest remains after all to
render everything knowable in the service of some greater good. This
means that such an obfuscation logically at some point will have to come
to light as well. The university]{.underline} therefore, according to
Derrida, seeks to be responsible by means of its incessantly revealing
function, and [has historically performed that
responsibility]{.underline} through the great Enlightenment concepts
like "the state, the sovereign, the people, knowledge, truth," and so
forth (1992, 4). Crucially though, [these concepts, while incessantly
reperformed and chanted today via the anti-neo-liberal activism of
various academic staff and students, essentially gesture towards an
abstraction or an absent, fictional addressee. 'The truth,' like 'the
people,' is after all only an imagined or fantasised universal, forever
lying in some kind of future or beyond, whereas its actualisation
is]{.underline}, as we saw with Lyotard, [marked by heterogeneity,
projection, and fragmentation]{.underline}. And this was always already
the case: indeed, Derrida says that in the past, or in a certain
idealised representation of that past, "one could at least pretend to
know whom one was addressing, and where to situate power" (1992, 3,
italics mine). It is this abstraction that constitutes, according to
Derrida, its utopian potential as a continuous crisis of legitimation,
and trying to close off that uncertainty of the validity of its
project---as Heidegger indeed did with a self-absorbed conception of the
properly German university---marks [the ascendance of a crisis that in
turn is thoroughly imbricated with a crisis of the state, of
metaphysics, and of technology]{.underline} (1992, 4).

The propositions at the heart of this paper are founded on the
conclusions of my recent work entitled Automatic Society, a book
concerned with the issues of full and general automation that have
accompanied the advent of the digital age.57 In it I argue that
[algorithmic automation is leading to the decline of wage labour and
employment, and hence to the imminent disappearance of the Keynesian
model of redistributing productivity gains, a model that has until now
been the basis of the macro-economic system's ability to remain
solvent]{.underline}. After the 'great transformation' that Karl Polanyi
described in 1944,58 which gave rise to what we now call the
Anthropocene, there is now taking place what amounts [to an immense
transformation, a transformation that presents us with an alternative: ▪
either we continue being led in the direction of
hyper-proletarianization and a generalized form of automatic piloting
that will engender both structural insolvency and a vertiginous increase
in entropy; ▪ or we lead ourselves out of the process of generalized
proletarianization]{.underline} into which we have been placed by 250
years of industrial capitalism -- [which requires negentropic
capabilities to be widely developed on a massive scale, through a noetic
politics of reticulation that places automatons, automation systems of
every kind, into the service of individual and collective capacities for
dis-automatization,]{.underline} that is, [into the service of the
production of negentropic bifurcations.]{.underline} [The immensity of
the transformation currently underway is due both to the speed of its
effects and to the fact that these effects operate on a global
scale.]{.underline} So-called '[big data]{.underline}' is a key example
of this immense transformation, which [is leading globalized consumerism
to liquidate all forms of knowledge]{.underline} (savoir vivre, savoir
faire and savoir conceptualiser, knowledge of how to live, do and
think). The Anthropocene is an 'Entropocene', that is, a period in which
[entropy is produced on a massive scale, thanks precisely to the fact
that what has been liquidated and automated is knowledge, so that in
fact it is no longer knowledge at all, but rather a set of closed
systems]{.underline}, that is, entropic systems. [Knowledge is an open
system: it always includes a capacity for dis-automatization that
produces negentropy.]{.underline} When Chris Anderson announced that the
era of 'big data', or what he calls the 'data deluge', would lead to the
'end of theory',59 he made a serious mistake, given that he ignored the
fact that to close an open system leads in a systemic way to its
disappearance. Given that it is founded on proletarianization and the
destruction of knowledge, the model of redistributing productivity gains
through employment is itself doomed. Another model of redistribution
must be conceived and implemented if we are to ensure macro-economic
solvency in the age of digital automation. The criteria for
redistribution that must now be adopted can no longer be founded on the
productivity of labour. [Productivity is today a question of machines,
and today's digital machine no longer has any need for either work or
employment]{.underline}. Manual work, which produces negentropy and
knowledge -- which Hegel discussed in terms of Knecht -- was, in the
nineteenth century, progressively replaced by proletarianized labour or
employment, that is, by a proletariat forced to submit to a machinery
that was entropic not just because of its consumption of fossil fuels,
but because of its standardization of operating sequences and the
resultant loss of knowledge on the side of the employee. This loss of
knowledge has today become so widespread that it has reached as far as
Alan Greenspan, as I have shown in Automatic Society, Volume 1, and as
he himself stated on October 23, 2008.60 [The Anthropocene is
unsustainable: it is a massive and high-speed process of destruction
operating on a planetary scale, and its current direction must be
reversed. The question and challenge of the Anthropocene is therefore
the 'Neganthropocene']{.underline}, that is, to find [a pathway that
will enable us to escape from this impasse of cosmic dimensions -- which
requires the elaboration of a new speculative cosmology]{.underline} in
the wake of Whitehead. [New criteria]{.underline}, as I said, m[ust be
implemented in order to organize redistribution in the economy of the
Neganthropocene, and these new criteria must be founded on the capacity
for dis-automatization]{.underline} that it is up to us to resuscitate.
[This necessarily involves a resurrection of]{.underline} what Amartya
Sen calls [capabilities]{.underline}, which he places at the foundation
of human development -- that is, of the individuation of humankind. 2
Knowledge, freedom and agency Amartya Sen relates 'capability' to [the
development of freedom]{.underline}, which he defines as always being
[both individual and collective]{.underline}: 'we have to see individual
freedom as a social commitment'.61 In this way, Sen remains faithful to
both Kantian and Socratic perspectives. Capability constitutes the basis
of economic dynamism and development, and it does so as freedom:
'Expansion of freedom is viewed, in this approach, both as the primary
end and as the principal means of development'.62 Freedom, in Sen's
definition, is therefore [a form of agency: the power to
act]{.underline}. Sen's comparative example of the incapacitating
effects of consumerism (that is, in his terms, of the indicators of
affluence) is wellknown: the black residents of Harlem have a lower life
expectancy than the people of Bangladesh, and this is precisely a
question of their 'agency'. [Freedom, here, is a question of knowledge
insofar as it is a capability that is always both individual and
collective -- and this means: individuated both psychically and
collectively.]{.underline} It was on this basis that Sen devised the
human development index in order to form a contrast with the economic
growth index. I would like to extend Sen's propositions by means of a
different analysis, one that leads to other questions. In particular,
[consideration must be given to the question of what relations psychic
and collective individuals can forge with automatons]{.underline}, in
order to achieve individual and collective bifurcations within an
industrial and economic system that, in becoming massively automated,
tends also to become closed. [The Anthropocene, insofar as it is an
'Entropocene', amounts to accomplished nihilism: it produces an
unsustainable levelling of all values that requires a leap into a
'transvaluation' capable of giving rise to a 'general
economy']{.underline} in Georges Bataille's sense, whose work I have
elsewhere tried to show [involves a reconsideration of libidinal
economy.]{.underline} The movement I am describing here is no doubt not
a transvaluation in a strict Nietzschean sense. Rather, it is an
invitation to reread Nietzsche with respect to questions of disorder and
order that in the following will be understood in terms of becoming and
future. 3 Becoming and future If there is to be a future \[avenir\], and
not just a becoming \[devenir\], [the value of tomorrow will lie in the
constitutive negentropy of the economy-to-come of the Neganthropocene.
For such an economy, the practical and functional differentiation
between becoming and future must form its criteria of evaluation -- only
in so doing will it be possible to overcome the systemic entropy in
which the Anthropocene consists. This economy requires a shift from
anthropology to neganthropology, where the latter is founded on what I
call general organology and on a pharmacology: the pharmakon is the
artefact and as such the condition of hominization, that is, an
organogenesis of artefactual organs and organizations, but it always
produces both entropy and negentropy, and hence it is always also a
threat to hominization.]{.underline} The problem raised by such a
perspective on the future is to know how to evaluate or measure
negentropy. Referred to as negative entropy by Erwin Schrödinger and as
anti-entropy by Francis Bailly and Giuseppe Longo, negentropy is always
defined in relation to an observer (see the work of Henri Atlan63 and of
Edgar Morin64) -- that is, it is always described in relation to a
locality that it as such produces, and that it differentiates within a
more or less homogeneous space (and this is why a neganthropology is
always also a geography). What appears entropic from one angle is
negentropic from another angle. Knowledge -- as savoir faire (that is,
knowledge of what to do so that I do not myself collapse and am not led
into chaos), as savoir vivre (that is, knowledge that enriches and
individuates the social organization in which I live without destroying
it), and as conceptual knowledge (that is, knowledge the inheritance of
which occurs only by passing through its transformation, and which is
transformed only by being revived through a process of what Socrates
called anamnesis, a process that, in the West, structurally exceeds its
locality) -- knowledge, in all these forms, is always a way of
collectively defining what is negentropic in this or that field of human
existence. [The inhuman refers to a way of denying the negentropic
possibilities of the human, that is, of denying its noetic freedom, and,
as a result, its agency]{.underline}. What Sen describes as freedom and
capability must be conceived from this cosmic perspective, and related
to Alfred North Whitehead's '[speculative cosmology', as constituting a
negentropic potentiality -- as the potential for openness of a localized
system, which, for that being we refer to as 'human', may always once
again become closed.]{.underline} Or, in Whitehead's terms[, human
beings may always relapse, decay into simpler forms, that is, become
inhuman]{.underline}.65 This is so only because the anthropological is
both hyperentropic and negentropic to the second degree: Anthropos is
organological, that is, pharmacological, or, as Jean-Pierre Vernant put
it, constitutively ambiguous. 4 Anthropology as entropology according to
Lévi-Strauss and beyond In addition to being fundamentally local, an
open, negentropic system is characterized by its relative sustainability
-- or in other words, by its finitude. [What is negentropic -- whether
idiom, tool, institution, market, desire and so on -- is always in the
course of its inevitable decay.]{.underline} What I call an idiotext
(Figure 1), as I attempted to define it in the final part of my thesis
(which has not yet been published), is an open locality taken up within
another, greater locality, or within what I describe as nested spirals
as they co-produce a process of collective individuation by psychically
individuating themselves. This is not without an echo in the questions
posed by Edgar Morin in The Nature of Nature.66 But Morin, like Atlan,
overlooks the essential, namely, the organological dimension (that is,
the technical and artificial dimension) of the negentropy characteristic
of Anthropos, which means that it is also pharmacological, that is, both
entropic and negentropic, and hence requires continual arbitration --
negotiations that are operations of knowledge as therapies and
therapeutics. In an idiotext tendencies compose, tendencies that are
highly pharmacological, that is, both entropic and negentropic, and, in
this way, they constitute a dynamic wherein figures or motives emerge
that are protentions, that is, differences that separate future from
becoming and thereby allow this separation to be perpetuated. These are
the motives and figures through which [knowledge is woven as the
circuits of transindividuation that form both within a generation and
between the generations.]{.underline} Since the early years of the
twenty-first century, at IRCAM, that is, as a result of my journey
through musicology, I have presented this composition of tendencies as
what results from negotiation between psychosomatic organisms (psychic
individuals), artificial organs (technical individuals) and social
organizations (collective individuations). It is through the complexity
of this negotiation that the principles of general organology are
formalized, as a kind of [pharmacological drama]{.underline}, that is,
as the constantly renewed and reposed problem of the decay of
negentropic conquests into entropic waste. This point of view is the
complete opposite of the conclusion reached by Claude Lévi-Strauss at
the end of Tristes Tropiques, when, having recalled that 'the world
began without man and will end without him', and that man works towards
'the disintegration of the original order of things and precipitates a
powerful organization of matter towards ever greater inertia, an inertia
that one day will be final',67 he adds that From the time when he first
began to breathe and eat, up to the invention of atomic and
thermonuclear devices, by way of the discovery of fire -- and except
when he has been engaged in self-reproduction -- man has done nothing
other than blithely break down billions of structures and reduce them to
a state in which they are no longer capable of integration.68 Hence
Lévi-Strauss poses with rare radicality the question of becoming without
being, that is, of the inevitably ephemeral character of the cosmos in
totality, as well as of the localities that form therein through
negentropic processes that are themselves always factors of entropic
accelerations. If we were to take this profoundly nihilistic statement
by LéviStrauss literally (when, for example, he writes that 'man has
done nothing other than blithely break down billions of structures and
reduce them to a state in which they are no longer capable of
integration'), we would be forced to assume that very little time
separates us from the 'end times'. We would be forced to reduce this
time to nothing, to annihilate it, and to discount negentropy on the
grounds of its being ephemeral: we would have to dissolve the future
into becoming, to assess it as null and void \[non avenu\], as never
coming, that is, as having ultimately never happened, the outcome of
having no future -- as becoming without future. And we would be forced
to conclude that what is ephemeral, because it is ephemeral, is merely
nothing. This is what the anthropologist literally says. I define myself
as a neganthropologist. And I have two objections to Lévi-Strauss: ▪ on
the one hand, that the question of reason, understood as a quasi-causal
power (in the Deleuzian sense) to bifurcate, that is, to produce, in the
jumble of facts, a necessary order forming a law, is always the question
of being 'worthy of what happens to us',69 which is another way of
describing the function of reason as defined by Whitehead, namely as
what makes a life a good life, and what makes a good life a better
life,70 that is, a struggle against static survival, which is nothing
other than the entropic tendency of all life; ▪ on the other hand, that
Lévi-Strauss's bitter and disillusioned sophistry seriously neglects two
points: 1 first, life in general, as 'negative entropy', that is, as
negentropy, is always produced from entropy, and invariably leads back
there: it is a detour -- as was said by Freud in Beyond the Pleasure
Principle and by Blanchot in The Infinite Conversation; 2 second,
technical life is an amplified and hyperbolic form of negentropy, that
is, of an organization that is not just organic but organological, but
which produces an entropy that is equally hyperbolic, and which, like
living things, returns to it, but does so by accelerating the speed of
the differentiations and indifferentiations in which this detour
consists, speed here constituting, then, a locally cosmic factor. This
detour in which technical life consists is desire as the power to
infinitize. It is misleading to give the impression, as Lévi-Strauss
does here, that man has an entropic essence and that he destroys some
'creation', some 'nature' that would on the contrary have a negentropic
essence -- alive, profuse and fecund, whether animal or vegetable.
Plants and animals are indeed organic orderings of highly improbable
inert matter (as is all negentropy), yet all life unfurls and succeeds
only by itself intensifying entropic processes: plants and animals are
themselves only an all too temporary and in the end futile detour in
becoming. By consuming and thereby disassociating what Lévi-Strauss
calls 'structures', all living things participate in a local increase of
entropy while at the same time locally producing a negentropic order.
What Derrida called différance, if we may indeed relate negentropy to
this concept, is first and foremost a matter of economy and detour. And
if it is also true that différance is an arrangement of retentions and
protentions, as Derrida indicates in Of Grammatology, and if it is true
that for those beings we call human, that is, technical and noetic
beings, arrangements of retentions and protentions are trans-formed by
tertiary retentions, then we should be able, on the basis of this
concept of différance, to redefine economy and desire (as configurations
of circuits that form themselves through these detours, as turns and
spirals). Unlike purely organic beings, those beings called human are
organological, that is, negentropic (and entropic) on two levels: both
as living beings, that is, organic beings, who through reproduction
bring about those 'minor differences'71 that lie at the origin of
evolution, and hence at the origin of what Schrödinger called negative
entropy,72 and as artificial beings, that is, organological beings, who
produce differentiations that are no longer those of what we refer to as
a species but of a 'kind', which in this case is humankind -- which is
what Simondon called the process of psychic and collective
individuation. Artifices are always detours, detours that are always
more or less ephemeral, like the genus of insects named ephemera,
neither more nor less 'without why' than those roses that are much
prized in Great Britain, and that are themselves essentially
artificial.73 But these artifices, inasmuch as they give rise to the
arts and to works and artworks of all kinds, as well as to science, can
infinitize themselves, and can infinitize their recipients beyond
themselves, that is, beyond their own end, projecting them into an
infinite protention of a promise always yet to come, which alone is able
to pierce the horizon of undifferentiated becoming. One might offer the
retort that my own objection to Lévi-Strauss, that organological
negentropy is not just organic, and constitutes what I thus refer to as
Neganthropos, necessarily implies that the organological is nothing but
an accelerator of entropization that precipitates the end and from this
perspective shortens what is ultimately essential, namely, the time of
this différance. But this would be to precisely misunderstand what I am
trying to say. There is no doubt that the question of speed in relation
to thermodynamic physics, as well as biology and zoology, is a crucial
issue. But the question here is of a politics of speed in which there
are opposing possibilities, and where it is a matter of knowing in what
way, where, on what plane and for how long what, in order to define the
dynamic of human evolution, Leroi-Gourhan called the 'urge to conquer
space and time', increases or reduces entropy.74 The concept of idiotext
with which I have been working is conceived precisely in order to
understand something not just as a question, but rather, as Deleuze
said, as a problem. In a situation as exceptional and unsustainable as
the Anthropocene, only a resolute assumption of the organological
condition, that is, an adoption of the organological condition, directed
towards an increase in negentropy, can transform the speed of
technological vectors currently at work -- in a world where today the
digital reaches speeds of two hundred thousand kilometres per second, or
two thirds of the speed of light, which is some four million times
faster than the speed of nerve impulses. Only such a resolute adoption
or assumption of the organological condition will allow us, in a literal
sense, to save time, that is, differentiation, insofar as, precisely, a
transvaluation of the industrial economy can commit us to and engage us
with the Neganthropocene, and disengage us from the Anthropocene. If the
hyperbolic negentropy in which the organological becoming of the organic
consists installs a neganthropology that accelerates (entropic and
anthropic) becoming, it can nevertheless also transform this
acceleration into a future that differs and defers this becoming,
according to the two senses of the verb différer mobilized by Derrida in
his term différance. Hence a (negentropic and neganthropic) future can
be established from this infinitizing form of protention that is the
object of desire as a factor of (psychic, social and technical)
individuation and integration -- failing which, différance will remain
merely formal. It is in the light of these questions -- effaced by
Lévi-Strauss's triste statement, his sad and gloomy words erasing the
indeterminacy of the future under the probabilistic weight of becoming
-- that today we must reinterpret Spinoza. 5 Noetic intermittence and
cosmic potlatch Organological beings are capable of purposefully
organizing the negentropic and organo-logical works that we are
referring to here as neganthropic. Depending on how they undertake this
organization that is both psychic and social, depending on the way that
they do or do not take care of the anthropic and neganthropic power in
which their behaviour consists, they can either indifferently
precipitate a release of entropy, or, on the contrary, differ and defer
it -- thereby constituting a différance that Simondon called
individuation and that he thinks as a process, as does Whitehead.75 We
ourselves support a neganthropological project conceived as care and in
this sense as an economy. This economy of care is not simply a power to
anthropologically transform the world (as 'masters and possessors of
nature'76). It is a pharmacological knowledge constituting a
neganthropology in the service of the Neganthropocene, in the way that
Canguilhem conceives the function of biology as the knowledge of life in
technical life, and in the way that Whitehead thinks the function of
reason within a speculative cosmology. Of course, we must identify and
describe the 'negative externalities' that the 'neganthropy' generated
by anthropization propagates in 'anthropized' milieus. But this is not a
question of nullifying neganthropy. Rather, and on the contrary, it is a
matter of passing from anthropization to neganthropization by
cultivating a positive pharmacology no more nor less ephemeral than life
that is carried along in becoming, as is everything that 'is' in the
universe. This care is the very thing in which this neganthropology
consists, and it is what Lévi-Strauss always ignored, by ignoring and
deliberately censoring the thought of Leroi-Gourhan. This situation
stems from the fact that Lévi-Straussian anthropology is founded on the
repression of organology (to which LeroiGourhan drew attention), and on
ignoring the neganthropological question that prevails beyond any
anthropology. This repression of the organological can be related to the
notion of dépense, of expenditure as conceived by Georges Bataille:
Every time the meaning of a discussion depends on the fundamental value
of the word useful -- in other words, every time the essential question
touching on the life of human societies is raised, \[...\] it is
possible to affirm that the debate is necessarily warped and that the
fundamental question is eluded. In fact \[...\], there is nothing that
permits one to define what is useful to man.77 At stake here are those
'so-called unproductive expenditures'78 that are always related to
sacrifice, that is, to 'the production of sacred things \[...\]
constituted by an operation of loss'.79 Every loss sacrifices,
sacralizes and sanctifies a default of being older than any being (and
this is how I read Levinas80). In this tenor of primordial default,
noetic intermittence is constituted, and can project itself
speculatively, only in and as a cosmic totality conceived
neganthropo-logically -- that is, as the knowledge and power to create
bifurcations within entropy. All noetic bifurcation, that is,
quasi-causal bifurcation, derives from a cosmic potlatch that indeed
destroys very large quantities of differences and orders, but it does so
by projecting a very great difference on another plane, constituting
another 'order of magnitude' against the disorder of a kosmos in
becoming, a kosmos that, without this projection of a yet-to-come from
the unknown, would be reduced to a universe without singularity.81 Thus
expenditure, even though it might be a social function, immediately
leads to an agonistic and apparently antisocial act of separation. The
rich man consumes the poor man's losses, creating for him a category of
degradation and abjection that leads to slavery. Now it is evident that,
from the endlessly transmitted heritage of the sumptuary world, the
modern world has received slavery, and has reserved it for the
proletariat.82 In this proletarianized world, the expenditure of the
'rich man' nevertheless becomes sterile: The expenditures taken on by
the capitalists in order to aid the proletarians and give them a chance
to pull themselves up on the social ladder only bear witness to their
inability (due to exhaustion) to carry out thoroughly a sumptuary
process. Once the loss of the poor man is accomplished, little by little
the pleasure of the rich man is emptied and neutralized; it gives way to
a kind of apathetic indifference.83 At a time when the
becoming-automatic of knowledge forms the heart of the economy, and does
so at the risk of denying itself as knowledge by taking the form of
a-theoretical computation, we will take up this project once again, from
an epistemic and epistemological perspective, in a second volume of
Automatic Society, to be subtitled The Future of Knowledge. There we
will show: ▪ that the question of the future of knowledge is inseparable
from that of the future of work; ▪ that this question must be translated
into an alternative industrial politics that gives to France and to
Europe their place in becoming -- and as trans-formations of this
becoming into futures. 6 Becoming, future and neganthropology Our
question is the future -- of work, of knowledge and of everything this
entails and generates, that is, everything -- insofar as it is not
soluble into becoming. That it is not soluble means nothing other than
the fact that it cannot be dissolved and (re)solved without this
dissolution being also its disappearance, that is, ours. This possible
dissolution in fact is what is not possible in law: we do not have the
right to just accept this and submit to it. Lévi-Strauss cannot conceive
this distinction between, on the one hand, that which remains radically
undetermined because it is strictly and constitutively improbable and
remains to come, and, on the other hand, that which is most probable,
and which is as such statistically determinable. If Lévi-Strauss is
obviously not unaware of the many discourses emerging from philosophy
that affirm the supra-causality of freedom -- and therefore of will --
in and before nature, he ultimately sees in this only an entropic power
that accelerates the decay of the world, far removed from any differing
and deferring that could give rise to new difference. In so doing,
Lévi-Strauss adopts that nihilistic perspective the advent of which was
announced by Nietzsche seventy years beforehand. We cannot accept the
Lévi-Straussian perspective. We cannot and we need not resolve to
dissolve ourselves into becoming. We cannot, because to do so would
consist in no longer promising to our descendants any possible future, a
future to come, and we need not because Lévi-Strauss's reasoning is
based on what in philosophy since its inception has consisted in
repressing the neganthropological dimension of the noetic soul and of
what we call 'human being', namely, the passage from the organic to the
organological in which this soul and being consists. Lévi-Strauss
proposes to understand anthropology as entropology. But he takes no
account of the negentropy generated by the technical form of life as
described by Canguilhem, that type that characterizes the noetic soul --
whose very noesis (producing what Lévi-Strauss called the 'works' of
man) is its intermittent fruit. Any noetic work, as the intermittent
fruit of noesis, produces a bifurcation and a singular difference in
becoming, irreducible to its laws (improbable, quasi-causal and in this
sense free -- as freedom of thought, ethical freedom and aesthetic
freedom). It would here be necessary to read Schelling. But such a
noetic work thereby engenders a pharmakon that can turn against its own
gesture -- and this is why the Aufklärung can give rise to its contrary,
namely, to what Adorno, Horkheimer and Habermas follow Weber in
describing as rationalization. Prior to Lévi-Strauss, Valéry, Freud and
Husserl all drew attention to this duplicity of spirit that was for the
Greeks of the tragic age their Promethean, Epimethean and hermeneutic
lot. But, unlike Lévi-Strauss, neither the Tragics, nor Valéry, nor
Freud, nor Husserl denied the neganthropological fecundity of noesis and
of its organological condition. This denial is equally characteristic of
the nihilism suffered by those who cannot conceive [the nihilism enacted
by absolutely computational capitalism]{.underline}, that is, by a
capitalism that has lost its mind and spirit -- and has done so thanks
not just to its rupture with its religious origin and the dissolution of
belief into fiduciary and calculable trust, but to the destruction it
has wrought upon all theory through the correlationist ideology founded
on the application of supercomputing to 'big data'. [Capitalism's loss
of spirit leads to the total proletarianization of the mind itself. To
fight against this state of fact in order to restore a state of law is
to prescribe, for the digital pharmakon that makes this state of fact
possible, a new state of law that recognizes this pharmacological
situation and that prescribes therapies and therapeutics so as to form a
new age of knowledge.]{.underline} The discourse of Lévi-Strauss is
profoundly nihilistic, literally desperate and fundamentally despairing
-- and as such it is neither lucid (enlightening) nor rational.
Rationality does not submit to becoming, and in this lies the unity of
the diverse dimensions of freedom, that is, of the improbable as
constituting the undetermined horizon of all ends worthy of the name,
within that 'kingdom of ends' that is the plane of interpretation of
what we refer to as 'consistences'. The latter do not exist, in the
sense that, as Whitehead indicates: Reason is a factor in experience
which directs and criticizes the urge towards the attainment of an end
realized in imagination but not in fact.84 Reason is an organ, as
Whitehead says, and this organ organizes the passage from fact to law,
that is, the realization of law in facts, law being the new, that is,
negentropy: Reason is the organ of emphasis upon novelty. It provides
the judgment by which realization in idea obtains the emphasis by which
it passes into realization in purpose, and thence its realization in
fact.85 Consistences are promises -- they are inherently improbable, and
it is as such that they make desirable a Neganthropos that remains
always to come,86 that is, improbable.87 This improbability is a spring
that returns again in the winter of universal decay, [the universe
localized on this inhabited Earth being the site of 'two main
tendencies': the slow decay of physical nature \[whereby,\] with
stealthy inevitableness, there is degradation of energy \[whereas\] the
other tendency is exemplified by the yearly renewal of nature in the
spring, and by the upward course of biological evolution. \[...\] Reason
is the self-discipline of the originative element in
history]{.underline}.88 It is this discipline that is lacking in
Lévi-Strauss, and in his entropology.
