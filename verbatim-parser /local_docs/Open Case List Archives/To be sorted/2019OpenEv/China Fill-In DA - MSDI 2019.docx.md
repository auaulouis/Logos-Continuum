Russia and China over Weapon Sales. National Interest.

The [Trump]{.underline} Administration [is hoping to boost the export
prospects for American weapons systems to allied countries]{.underline}
by modifying policies and streamlining the bureaucratic process. The
Trump Administration announced a revised conventional arms transfer
policy in April, but that is just the first step. There are more policy
changes coming down the line.

"[The]{.underline} new policy reflects the [priorities]{.underline} of
the president's National Security Strategy," Ambassador Tina Kaidanow,
Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, said
on Aug. 8 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"Which [are]{.underline}, namely, [to preserve peace through strength by
reforming regulations]{.underline} to facilitate the exports of U.S.
military equipment; to [strengthen partners and allies; to facilitate
U.S. economic security and innovation."]{.underline}

Under the new policy, the United States hopes to make its export
bureaucracy more proactive and cut red tape in the process.

"These steps are among the first in what we hope will be a series of
efforts to streamline the arms transfer process," Kaidanow said.

"I can assure you that my colleagues and I at the State Department, but
also again more broadly in the USG, will continue exploring ways to cut
red tape and give U.S. industry every advantage in an increasingly
competitive global marketplace, while continuing to ensure the
responsible export of arms."

The United States is making these policy changes with great power
competition with China and Russia in mind.

"We're trying to improve our ability to compete with our adversaries by
providing our partners with viable alternatives to foreign products in
order to maintain influence in key regions throughout the world," Laura
Cressey, Deputy Director for Regional Security and Arms Transfers at
U.S. Department of State, said.

"We're going to be working with our partners and allies to identify
critical capability requirements that they have and then trying to
expedite transfers to support these essential foreign policy and
national security objectives."

However, writing the policy guidance is the easy part. Implementing the
policy will be far more challenging.

"The release of the new policy was only the first step in a series of
what we believe will be very practical results-focused initiatives to
transform the way that the U.S. government works to support and grow our
defense industrial base," Kaidanow said.

"Through that memorandum, the president also directed the secretary of
state, in coordination with the secretaries of defense, commerce, and
energy, to submit an implementation plan within 60 days."

As part of the effort, the United States is looking at reforming export
hurdles such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which has
been a vexing problem for the defense industry for decades.

"[We'll look at streamlining]{.underline} the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations, or [ITAR, and also continuing to revise the U.S.
Munitions List and the Commerce Control List,"]{.underline} Cressey
said.

Additionally, the State Department and Defense Department will try to
speed up the bureaucratic processes involved in weapons exports.

"We will also be looking at the day-to-day processes to ensure that we
are as efficient, as streamlined, and as effective as possible," Cressey
said.

"So some of the things that we're looking at, and that folks in industry
and associations have asked us to look at, is: establishing milestones
and timelines for the foreign military sales process; improving and
speeding up our contracting process -- processes within the Defense
Department; trying to increase the competitiveness of U.S. defense items
and systems by building in exportability to the design and development;
and also by expanding support for what we call non-program-of-record
systems. We're looking into potential financing options that could make
our systems more attainable for our foreign partners. And we're also
examining existing polices to ensure that they don't unnecessarily
detract from our ability to compete in international -- in the
international marketplace."

Without the changes, [the United States is increasingly in danger of
losing its market share as China]{.underline}, in particular,
[increasing develops and produces evermore-capable weapons for the
export market.]{.underline} One example is the Unmanned Aerial Systems
([UAS]{.underline}) [market]{.underline}, [which the United States
dominates]{.underline}, but which [is also threatened by Chinese
competition and by Washington's tight export regulations.]{.underline}

"By removing some of the previous administration's artificial barriers
to the transfer of arms to critical partners, the UAS export policy
being one example, [this administration is both strengthening our hand
in the ongoing strategic competition while also stimulating economic
growth at home, as well as job creation]{.underline}," Alex Gray,
Special Assistant to the President for the Defense Industrial Base,
said.

"It should be noted that the [U.S. aerospace and defense industries
contribute almost \$1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy]{.underline}
and they support about 2.5 million American jobs. Just as one point, the
international -- [UAS export market alone is estimated to be worth more
than \$50 billion a year within the next decade]{.underline}. Those are
the stakes we're competing for."

[Those nations that are unable to purchase American weapons could find
that China or Russia are more than willing to supply them with
comparable systems.]{.underline}

"[We are witnessing China]{.underline} -- as an example, not alone --
but China [filling voids the U.S. left with a denial to a friend or
ally]{.underline}," Keith Webster, president of the Defense and
Aerospace Export Council at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said.

"The consequence of a denial filled by China or others is as follows:
[The U.S. loses market share that is not easily recaptured, and in some
cases will never be recaptured.]{.underline} The [U.S. loses control of
the capability. The U.S. loses the opportunity to train, influence, and
maintain a military relationship with foreign forces, who now are
introducing into their inventory a Chinese]{.underline} -- Korean,
Israeli, et cetera -- [capability]{.underline}."

There are some immediate examples that Webster said he could point to.
"[We never answered India's request for ballistic missile defense
capability]{.underline}."

"That ask of the U.S. went unanswered for a number of years. And [now,
India has been forced to consider]{.underline} and has -- may
potentially go buy, potentially, [the Russian S-400 system]{.underline}.
Similar to what Turkey's buying---or said they were going to buy. Now we
are rushing to put together a proposal for BMD for India to counter that
situation."

PROTECTING THE PARTY

While the Party's primary focus remains on domestic issues such as
corruption deemed central to its legitimacy, [Chinese leaders have
sharpened thseir focus on those aspects of developing country
relationships deemed likely to bolster the Party's fortunes amid this
turbulence]{.underline}.\[4\] Two significant areas in which [the CCP
has stepped up influence efforts to benefit Party control are the
economic and information domains]{.underline}.\[5\]

First, [Beijing wants to mitigate mounting economic challenges and
slowing growth in China through overseas investment and the creation of
markets]{.underline} abroad [for Chinese goods and
materials]{.underline}. The Party's legitimacy depends on the health of
China's economy.\[6\] Access to resources needed to feed China's growing
economy has long driven its engagement with the developing world, but
China's economy is now struggling. [Chinese leaders are therefore
looking to further boost overseas investment and trade]{.underline},
which have been growing for years but have been partially rebranded
under the BRI. [As part of its broader economic development strategy,
Beijing is using BRI to]{.underline} export massive quantities of steel
and aluminum, [find new markets for Chinese products,]{.underline} and
help keep indebted state-owned enterprises (SOEs) afloat.\[7\] BRI
projects, many of which are implemented through provincial governments
eager to capitalize, facilitate the expansion of Chinese companies'
international footprint.\[8\] These efforts are viewed as critical to
propping up growth and employment as China endures an uncertain
transition from a manufacturing focus to services and consumption,
including potential reforms likely to result in layoffs.\[9\]

#### CCP leadership causes war -- territorial expansionism, trade, confrontation with the US

Mike **Gallagher 19,** 5-9-2019, \"The Sources of CCP Conduct,\"
American Interest,
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/>

**[[The Chinese Communist Party is hard-wired for hostile
expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[and it poses a threat to the free
worl]{.underline}d unlike any since George Kennan's time. In his Long
Telegram to the State Department in 1946, Wisconsin's George Kennan
[argued](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/coldwar/documents/episode-1/kennan.htm)
that the nature of the Soviet regime led to irreconcilable differences
with the United States. Soviet leaders were "committed fanatically to
the belief that with \[the United States\] there can be no permanent
modus vivendi." In order to preserve their own power, it was necessary
to break "the international authority of \[the American\] state."
Dealing with this threat, in Kennan's view, would be the "greatest task
our diplomacy has ever faced and probably greatest it will ever have to
face." Today, we face a similar strategic challenge. As Vice President
Mike Pence
[argued](https://www.hudson.org/events/1610-vice-president-mike-pence-s-remarks-on-the-administration-s-policy-towards-china102018)in
his October speech outlining America's strategic competition with China,
decades of well-meaning U.S. engagement have emboldened China's rulers.
[[The]{.mark} Chinese Communist Party ([CCP) has grown more aggressive
in the East and South China Seas,]{.mark} in its [distortion of free
markets]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and [[theft of intellectual
property, and in its challenge to democratic values]{.mark} within China
and [around the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. These actions represent a
holistic approach to maximizing Chinese national power at the expense of
the United States and the liberal norms that we, along with our allies,
have sustained for decades. The free world faces a threat unlike
anything seen since Kennan's time. Pence's speech was a long-overdue
recognition of this fact and the most prominent exposition to date of
CCP aggression. Yet he did not explain why the CCP behaves the way it
does. Seven decades ago, Kennan
[wrote](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/1947-07-01/sources-soviet-conduct)
that the "characteristics of Soviet policy. . . .are basic to the
internal nature of Soviet power and will be with us. . . .until the
internal nature of Soviet power is changed." Likewise, **[understanding
the CCP is essential to understanding China's external ambitions and why
they cannot be reconciled with those of the free world]{.underline}**.
Until the internal nature of CCP power changes, the regime will pursue
policies that undermine U.S. interests and those of our allies. What
follows is a closer look at the sources of CCP conduct, or put
differently, the link between the nature of this regime and its
behavior. The Long Shadow of Chinese History The first source of CCP
conduct is Chinese history---or, more precisely, certain strongly held
and CCP-perpetuated narratives about China's history. Two narratives
stand out, both of which reflect politicized versions of true history
and blend chauvinism, insecurity, and imperial ambition. [The first
narrative comes from Chinese dynastic history]{.underline}. Unlike
Europe, where countries competed constantly for power, [China enjoyed
long periods without true
rivals]{.underline}.[1](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn1)
Though dynasties rose and fell, [the Chinese [viewed
themselves](https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/zhongguo-tianxia-chinese-international-relations-terms/)
at the center of]{.underline} "all under **[heaven]{.underline}**" or
the central node in a world that revolved around them. To an extent, it
did. Through [a system that extended Chinese economic and political
influence through much of East Asia, Chinese rulers
[received](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/chinese-worldviews-and-china-s-foreign-policy)
tribute "in exchange for economic and sometimes security
benefits."]{.underline} Echoes of this narrative can be seen in CCP
General Secretary **[[Xi Jinping's]{.mark} [2014
[declaration]{.mark}](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1159951.shtml)
[of a "new Asian security concept]{.mark}]{.underline}**," [[in which he
called for "the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia]{.mark}, solve
the problems of Asia and uphold the security of Asia]{.underline}."
X**[[i's message is clear: It is time for the Americans to leave and for
China to return to its idealized traditional primacy over its Asian
neighbor-vassals]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The second narrative is that
the greatest threat to China is weak central leadership that invites
foreign aggression and corresponding national humiliation. This
narrative springs from several different periods in Chinese history. One
is the early fifth century to third century B.C.E., known as the
[Warring States
era](https://thediplomat.com/2013/12/why-chinese-study-the-warring-states-period/).
During this window, Chinese politics more closely resembled Europe, with
multiple independent states balancing against one another, shifting
their allegiances, and vying for power. In another period of weakness a
millennium and a half later, colonial powers progressively eroded
Chinese sovereignty beginning with the 1839 Opium War and continuing
until the 1945 Kuomintang and allied victory over Imperial Japan---a
[period](https://thediplomat.com/2014/09/the-ccp-didnt-fight-imperial-japan-the-kmt-did/)
the CCP calls the "Century of Humiliation." Contemporary CCP leaders
manipulate these narratives to justify the repression and expansion of
China's periphery. From the Warring States period, Chinese leaders have
inherited a deep insecurity over territorial fissures, including Taiwan
and Tibet. This insecurity is why "unification" with Taiwan is central
to General Secretary Xi's "[Chinese
dream"](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2180391/chinese-president-xi-jinping-urges-taiwan-follow-hong-kong-model)
of "national rejuvenation"---**[[despite the fact that Taiwan has never
been controlled by the CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and only very rarely
by any mainland Chinese government. **[[CCP leaders also continually
foster a sense of grievance about foreign]{.underline}]{.mark}**
meddling that, [in its
telling](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/chinese-worldviews-and-china-s-foreign-policy),
only the Party could have stopped, and only the Party can prevent from
happening again. Chinese history also guides CCP leaders by allowing
them to draw upon longstanding traditions in what they call "barbarian
handling." Long before the founding of the CCP, **[China mastered the
practice of making adversaries dependent upon its economic
largesse]{.underline}**. **[China also successfully indoctrinated
competitors, pressuring the leaders of competitive states to gradually
shift their value systems closer to China's]{.underline}**. Historian
Edward Luttwak writes that these practices had
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} effect of making adversaries "psychologically
as well as economically dependent on imperial radiance, which was
willingly extended in brotherly fashion when the Han were weak, and then
withdrawn when \[rivals\] were reduced to
vassalage."[2](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn2)
This history casts a long shadow over [[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}
policymaking. It **[[predisposes China to view nations as either
hegemons or vassals, not coequals. It teaches CCP leaders
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** foster economic dependence in other countries
and to **[[manipulate foreign elite opinion to perceive Chinese power as
benign or beneficial]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And internally, it
encourages a chronic anxiety that China could at any moment succumb to
separatist movements and fall back into disunity. All of these traits
are apparent in daily CCP behavior. The CCP as an Influence Organization
The second source of CCP conduct, and one habitually discounted by
Westerners, is the Party's own history as an underground influence
organization. From its earliest days, the CCP has played the role of
insurgent, first within China and then abroad as it has sought to expand
its power. [[A central tool in this struggle has been "United Front"
work, or "a range of methods to influence]{.underline}]{.mark} overseas
Chinese communities, [[foreign governments, and other actors to take
actions or adopt positions supportive of Beijing's preferred
policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}"[3](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn3)
Sometimes, [the CCP channels such activities through seemingly benign
organizations such as educational or cultural groups that quietly
promote Party interests.]{.underline} Other times, [[United Front
activities are clearly illegal, such as bribery or extortion]{.mark}.
Regardless of its form, United Front work consistently aims to "stifle
criticism of the CCP, spread positive views of China, and influence
voters in foreign democracies to adopt domestic policies more favorable
to China," as a recent congressional report put
it.]{.underline}[4](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn4)
Although United Front work originated with Lenin, it has blossomed under
the CCP. The Party spent its formative years too weak to pose a military
threat to the Japanese or the Kuomintang, and relied instead on
"intelligence" activities (a term the Party often used interchangeably
with United Front work). The Party
[credits](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2018/august/1533045600/john-garnaut/australia-s-china-reset)
its underground influence operations for playing a decisive role in its
victory in the 1949 civil war. The CCP Politburo went as far as to
approve a resolution shortly after the establishment of the PRC that
emphasized the role intelligence operations played in the Party's
victory.[5](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn5)
Individuals well versed in United Front activities quickly rose to
prominence within the Party bureaucracy. Many in the CCP's core
leadership today, including General Secretary Xi himself, are the direct
descendants of United Front leaders. John Garnaut, an Australian
journalist-turned-policymaker who was instrumental in alerting Western
leaders to growing CCP interference in democratic societies, [has
argued](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2018/august/1533045600/john-garnaut/australia-s-china-reset)
that men such as Xi's father, Xi Zhongxun, "did not earn their seats at
the revolutionary head table by feats of military prowess on the
battlefield. Rather. . . .\[they\] were masters of United Front work and
earned their stripes by massaging and manipulating the language,
perceptions and actions of the Party's adversaries." Seen in this light,
the CCP's roots were less as a political party than as an insurgent
organization whose core mission was to manipulate external perceptions
in order to advance its power.Seen in this light, the CCP's roots were
less as a political party than as an insurgent organization whose core
mission was to manipulate external perceptions in order to advance its
power. As Garnaut put it: "The Party's contemporary institutions,
ideology and methodologies continue to reflect its origins as an
underground organization." While the CCP's United Front Work Department
(UFWD) is nominally responsible for overseeing these efforts, "\[a\]ll
of the Party's 86 million members are expected to take on United Front
responsibilities in their dealings with non-party members. In short,
influence work is the Party's stock-in-trade." In recent years, General
Secretary Xi has singled out United Front work as a "magic weapon" to
promote the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," establishing and
personally leading a working group on United Front work, assigning UFWD
officials to top posts, and adding about 40,000 UFWD
cadres.[6](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn6)These
activities are increasingly bringing the CCP into conflict with
democratic institutions abroad. United Front work is more than the CCP
behaving badly; it is central to the Party's identity, history, and
global objectives. As long as the CCP governs China, United Front work
will figure prominently into Chinese foreign policy. Dictatorship and
"Security" [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} third [[defining source of CCP
conduct is the dictatorial nature of its power]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Like the ruling class in any autocracy, CCP leaders fear losing power.
[The party [perceives
itself](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-secret-memo-1429841508) to
be engaged in a "life-or-death struggle" against Western ideas,
including democracy,]{.underline} the universality of [human
rights]{.underline}, [neoliberal economic policy, and]{.underline} even
[independent journalism]{.underline}. In an infamous leaked memorandum
known as Document No. 9, CCP leaders lay out an existential ideological
struggle, couched in Orwellian terms, against "false ideological trends"
at home and abroad. CCP propaganda hammers home this message by
portraying liberal democracy as outdated and ineffective. As the PRC's
Xinhua state-run news agency [puts
it](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-politics/china-state-media-attacks-western-democracy-ahead-of-congress-idUSKBN1CM0AB),
"After several hundred years, the Western model is showing its age. It
is high time for profound reflection on the ills of a doddering
democracy which has precipitated so many of the world's ills and solved
so few." The goal is to discredit Western ideas while presenting China
as an alternative model for the developing world. For example, a CCP
propaganda outlet
[argued](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1135224.shtml) the latest
U.S. government shutdown showed American "democracy and government are
unable to provide the solution to an enlarging income gap, opposition
among different classes, worsening partisan polarization. \[. . .\] The
government mechanism, designed more than 100 years ago, is
malfunctioning." The CCP's sense of ideological struggle also creates an
absolutist view of security.The CCP's sense of ideological struggle also
creates an absolutist view of security. As China analyst Peter Mattis
has
[argued](http://eng.mod.gov.cn/publications/2017-03/03/content_4774229.htm),
the CCP's quest for total security is embodied in the 2015 National
Security Law, which defines "national security" as the absence of
internal and external threats to the regime, its economic interests, or
its territorial integrity. [Since the CCP cannot claim legitimacy
through elections, it seeks legitimacy by expanding its power at home
and abroad]{.underline}, particularly through the use of technology for
social control. Analysis from the Jamestown Foundation suggests that
China's domestic security expenditures have sharply increased in recent
years and began outpacing Chinese military spending beginning in 2010.
For example, spending on domestic security outpaced the budget for
external defense by [about 19
percent](https://jamestown.org/program/chinas-domestic-security-spending-analysis-available-data/)
in 2017. These investments support a ["social credit"
system](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-tool-for-social-control-a-credit-rating-for-everything-1480351590),
now in a pilot phase, that serves as an Uber-style rating for Chinese
citizens collated from their most intimate data: their personal
finances, their traffic infractions, the private messages they write on
their phones, what they browse or buy online and in stores, where they
go, and who they interact with---activities automatically monitored by
hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras furnished with
facial-recognition software. Loyalty to the government is also measured
and, when deemed insufficient, punished. Citizens with higher scores
receive perks such as easier credit, access to luxury hotels, lower
insurance premiums, quicker access to government services, and
scholarships to the best schools. Individuals who criticize or organize
against CCP policies may find it hard to apply to college, travel, or
even find a job. Prominent CCP members and Chinese industrialists
promote surveillance technology as a means of not only ensuring
obedience to the Party, but also succeeding where every other Marxist
experiment has failed. As Liu Qiangdong, founder of China's online
retailer [JD.com](http://jd.com/), [put
it](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1062482.shtml), "with the
technologies we have laid out in the last two or three years, I have
come to recognize that communism can indeed be achieved in our
generation." Alibaba founder and CCP member Jack Ma has
[argued](http://www.aei.org/publication/lessons-from-the-great-recession-a-long-read-qa-with-michael-strain-and-stan-veuger/)
that "with access to all kinds of data, we may be able to find the
invisible hand of the market." In both cases, a Silicon Valley-style
blind faith in the transformative power of technology blends with the
CCP's concrete ambitions to centralize and optimize control over Chinese
society and the economy. [The CCP has chosen]{.underline} the autonomous
region of [Xinjiang---where it feels threatened by separatists within
the Islamic Uighur population---to field test its instruments of
repression and]{.underline} provide a glimpse into the logical
conclusion of [its quest for security]{.underline}. As one UN report
[put
it](https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23452&LangID=E),
the CCP has "turned the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region into something
that resembled a massive internment camp shrouded in secrecy, a 'no
rights zone.'" [In these camps, "detainees are subject to waterboarding,
being kept in isolation without food and water, and \[are\] prevented
from
sleeping."]{.underline}[[7](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn7)
The total number detained in camps could be [as high as three
million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-concentrationcamps/china-putting-minority-muslims-in-concentration-camps-us-says-idUSKCN1S925K)]{.underline}---a
number that would represent about 38 percent of the entire Uighur
population of Xinjiang. Outside of the camps, Xinjiang's population
faces constant security checks and pervasive surveillance. Uighurs must
download a
[smartphone](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/report-uyghurs-in-china-forced-to-install-surveillance-app-that-leaves-their-data-unsecured-04102018164341.html)
[application](https://www.opentech.fund/news/app-targeting-uyghur-population-censors-content-lacks-basic-security/)
that scans personal data, including photos, videos, and documents for
state review. [The CCP is using Xinjiang to perfect its totalitarian
surveillance state throughout China.]{.underline} In the process, it is
exposing the lengths it will go to stay in power and its intentions
abroad. United Front Work and the Subversion of Western Institutions
Driven by Chinese history, its own history as an influence organization,
and its need for total security, the CCP is programed for interference
in foreign societies. Like the Soviet Union in 1946, the CCP's
motivations, experiences, biases, and goals cannot be reconciled with
those of the free world. The CCP does not believe in a permanent modus
vivendi---at least not in the Indo-Pacific---with the United States. As
Chinese power has increased, it has become more aggressive, belligerent,
and coercive. From the militarization of the South China Sea, to
widespread technology transfer to seize the commanding heights of the
global economy, to debt-trap diplomacy in developing economies, the
CCP's behavior makes sense considering its unique political personality.
And as Vice President Pence outlined, the CCP's belligerence in one
domain cannot be separated from its aggression in another. Military
activities are directly connected to economic initiatives, which are in
turn connected with political interference operations. The CCP's
political interference operations---intended to subvert and corrupt key
Western institutions---are the least studied, most subtle, and perhaps
most important of these forms of aggression.The CCP's political
interference operations---intended to subvert and corrupt key Western
institutions---are the least studied, most subtle, and perhaps most
important of these forms of aggression. While it is easy to understand
the threat posed by planting military equipment on disputed islands or
hacking the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the CCP's systematic
delegitimization of Western institutions is more insidious. At the
United Nations, for example, [in the 15 years following the Tiananmen
Square massacre, the CCP [defeated a dozen
resolutions](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/FP_20181009_china_human_rights.pdf)
condemning its human rights abuses, often leveraging its economic power
to help secure the votes of developing nations]{.underline}. While the
CCP has continued playing defense at the UN over human rights, in recent
years it has gone on offense, using bribery and intimidation and in the
process blurring the lines between corruption and United Front-style
political warfare. Consider the case of Sheri Yan, a Chinese-born
socialite who in 2015 was
[arrested](https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/beijing-s-secret-plot-to-infiltrate-un-used-australian-insider-20181031-p50d2e.html)on
charges of bribing John Ashe, a former president of the UN General
Assembly. Through a complex network of intermediaries, including
suspected CCP spies, Yan funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from
United Front-affiliated sources through her UN-designated NGO to
influential UN officials, including Ashe. At the same time, her NGO
employed the wife of a second General Assembly president, Sam Kutesa.
Kutesa was allegedly taking \$500,000 in bribes from Patrick Ho, a
United Front-associated former Hong Kong official. Ho was also
[accused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-wants-new-world-order-u-n-china-linked-ngos-secretly-paid-cash-promote-beijings-vision-145746181.html?soc_src=hl-viewer&soc_trk=tw)
of using a UN-associated non-profit to bribe UN diplomats, including
both Kutesa and Ashe. Ho used his position of influence to advocate
tirelessly for the Belt and Road Initiative. When asked about Ho's
corruption and his support for Belt and Road, a UN spokesman echoed Xi
Jinping's precise language, calling the initiative an avenue for
"win-win cooperation." CCP United Front work has also aimed at
subverting the institution of free speech, especially at foreign
universities. In light of the key role students played in the Tiananmen
demonstrations, the CCP created Chinese Students and Scholars
Associations (CSSAs) to reassert ideological control over students at
home and abroad. The more than 142 U.S. CSSA chapters are publicly
designed to assist Chinese students studying abroad, but also double as
mechanisms for the CCP to restrain the free speech and liberty of the
same students they are supposed to
serve.[8](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn8)
The University of Tennessee CSSA mandates members "protect the
motherland's honor and image" while forcing students from Taiwan to
support "national
reunification."[9](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn9)
CSSA chapters have threatened retaliation against schools that have
invited the Dalai Lama to campus, while even those more hesitant to toe
the CCP line have been pressured to submit proof of their cooperation to
government
officials.[10](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn10)
As more attention has focused on the state-supported nature of CSSAs,
many chapters have taken to deleting, obfuscating, or otherwise
concealing their financial connections to the CCP. Sometimes ties are
more open, and CCP cells have sprung up in more than a half dozen
states, spanning the country from California to New York. In one case
from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, students returning
to China after studying abroad [were
pressured](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/18/the-chinese-communist-party-is-setting-up-cells-at-universities-across-america-china-students-beijing-surveillance/)
to reveal whether their peers had demonstrated "anti-party thought."
When a German journalism student studying in China was expelled after
reporting on human rights abuses, Chinese state media ran an op-ed
chiding him for not obeying Chinese laws. The op-ed
[argued](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1115176.shtml): "If \[the
student\] was a Chinese student studying in Germany, the Chinese people
would accept he must obey German law. But the worst part is some Germans
and Western people believe that their laws should play the dominant role
in friction between China and the West, even in China. The reason is
they believe their laws are universal." This rhetoric is disingenuous.

A PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman
[stressed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42124444) "mutual
respect is what the official host should provide their guest, and that
respect between any two countries should be mutual." According to the

CCP norms, especially when it comes to free speech (or lack thereof),
should prevail both at home and abroad. Besides free speech, the CCP is
attacking the institution of state sovereignty by arguing all
individuals of Chinese descent, regardless of citizenship, are beholden
to the CCP. For example, in speaking of Malays of Chinese descent, the
Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia
[said](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/kl-wants-chinese-envoy-to-explain-remarks),
"No matter how far you are, no matter how many generations you stay,
(for) overseas Chinese, China is forever your tender maternal home." He
further warned that China would "not sit idly by" in the face of
"infringement on China's national interests or violations of legal
rights and interests of Chinese citizens and businesses." In recent
years, [the CCP has [expanded
efforts](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/china-influence-defence-parliamentary-sovereignty)
to assert the nationality of "overseas Chinese]{.underline}," regardless
of their actual citizenship or wishes. In 2017, CCP officials laid out
an [expansive
vision](http://www.china.org.cn/china/2017-10/23/content_41777176.htm)
of United Front work to ensure "\[a\]ll Chinese both at home and abroad
are striving to realize the Chinese Dream." As part of this strategy,
[the CCP encourages overseas Chinese to become politically
active]{.underline} in an effort "to mobilize public opinion. . . . [to
promote the PRC's economic and political agenda
abroad]{.underline}."[11](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn11)
Acting as if this overseas constituency votes as a bloc, the CCP
recently
[threatened](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/foreign-affairs/chinas-veiled-threat-to-bill-shorten-on-extradition-treaty/news-story/ad793a4366ad2f94694e89c92d52a978)
political repercussions if the Australian Labor Party did not support
Beijing's demands for an extradition treaty. In a series of high-profile
cases, the CCP has also detained foreign nationals it claims are PRC
citizens. One Chinese-born Swedish citizen has been [kidnapped
twice](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/how-china-snatched-gui-minhai-train-beijing-bookseller-hong-kong)
by PRC authorities---once while on vacation in Thailand and once right
in front of Swedish officials on a train from Shanghai. The Swede
released a hostage-style
[statement](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-18/missing-hong-kong-book-publisher-gui-minhai-china-custody-arrest/7094276)
while detained: "Although I now hold the Swedish citizenship, deep down
I still think of myself as a Chinese. My roots are in China." In another
case, two young Americans, Victor and Cynthia Liu, along with their
mother, are being arbitrarily held in China. While Victor was born on
American soil, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has
[argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/us/politics/china-exit-ban.html)
that all three are PRC citizens. In both cases, the CCP's message is
clear: Chinese blood supersedes the rights of other states and their
citizens. Why Should We Care? Americans might reasonably ask why such
Chinese aggression matters. China, like any powerful state, is
aggressively pursuing its interests. And even if the CCP were to
successfully create an "Asia for Asians" and displace the U.S. as the
dominant Indo-Pacific power, America would still have a strong economy,
a dominant position in the Western Hemisphere, and frayed but strong
alliances, especially in Europe. To understand why this scenario would
be threatening to American interests, Kennan again provides a helpful
framework. In 1948, he argued that there were five centers of industrial
and military power: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and
central Europe, the USSR, and Japan. America's foremost interest was
ensuring that Soviet political control did not extend over any of these
centers beyond the USSR
itself.[12](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn12)
**[[Today the centers of economic production and
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the strongpoints Kennan sought to
defend---**[[have shifted to the Indo-Pacific. According to some
estimates, Asia itself could comprise as much as half of global GDP [by
2050](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/28608/asia2050-executive-summary.pdf).]{.underline}]{.mark}**
As Jakub Grygiel has argued, China's growth in East Asia combined with
Russia's weakness in Eurasia have changed the locale of power, likely
making the sea lanes of East Asia "the key lifelines of the
world."[13](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn13)
**[[With this concentration of economic power]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
its own backyard, **[[the CCP does not have to project power far in
order to dominate the global economy.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[Consequently, an American retreat from the Indo-Pacific would put the
world's vital hub of economic activity in Chinese hands.]{.underline}
Given its track record, **[[the CCP would use this Indo-Pacific sphere
of influence to further subvert Western institutions and extract painful
concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The CCP would not be content
"solving" the Taiwan or Tibet questions and then focusing on China's
internal development.The CCP would not be content "solving" the Taiwan
or Tibet questions and then focusing on China's internal development. It
would expand the boundaries of its growing surveillance state, targeting
non-PRC citizens who oppose its agenda. It would nurture dependence in
weaker states, creating a system of vassals rather than partners. Most
of all, the free and open world built by the United States and our
allies in the aftermath of World War II, with corresponding gains in
global standards of living and human rights, would be replaced by a
chaotic contest for the global commons and the steady expansion of CCP
social control. The CCP's Orwellian nightmare would replace America's
Lockean dream. Through their actions, CCP leaders have warned us
repeatedly that this is the world they are working to build. **[[CCP
policies reflect a remarkably clear and comprehensive agenda to overtake
the United States, displace us in the Indo-Pacific, and corrupt
our]{.mark}]{.underline}** foremost
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Kennan said of the Soviets,
they show a "cautious, persistent pressure toward the disruption and
weakening of all rival influence and rival power." Toward a
Counter-Finlandization Strategy To prevent this future, we must first
recognize that we are in a contest for global leadership---but until
recently, only one side has been playing. There are some signs, however,
that America is starting to take this challenge seriously. The 2017
National Security Strategy and 2018 National Defense Strategy both
identify China as a revisionist power and America's top threat. Congress
has also taken important bipartisan steps over the past two years like
lifting defense spending caps in 2018 and 2019, expanding authorities
for examining CCP-directed investments in the United States, passing the
BUILD Act to help meet growing international demand for infrastructure
investment, and shining a light on CCP espionage threats on college
campuses. America, in other words, is awakening to the challenge, but we
still need a clear framework to guide our actions. If containment was
America's operative framework vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, we need a new
organizing principle today, at least while the CCP remains in power. One
might be found by examining the Soviet Union's relationship with not the
United States, but Finland. "Finlandization" became a Cold War shorthand
for a nominally independent but functionally subservient country. As one
declassified CIA report
[describes](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-55.pdf),
the Finns "hoped to keep their independence by significantly limiting
it, to secure their neutrality by generally leaning to one side, and to
maintain their democratic privileges by restricting them in certain key
areas. . . . In practice, this policy has meant the frequent sacrifice
of Finland's economic interests and political preferences to the needs
of assuaging Soviet suspicions and meeting Soviet demands." Today, the
United States must focus its efforts on preventing the Finlandization of
the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Ultimately, a counter-Finlandization
strategy is about choice---not between China and the United States---but
ensuring that allies and partners have the confidence and the ability to
choose their own path, free from economic and military coercion.
[Countries that wish to preserve their independence, regional peace, and
economic prosperity will have to act with the understanding that all
three are under threat from the CCP.]{.underline} **[[Countries that
wish to preserve their independence, regional peace, and economic
prosperity will have to act with the understanding that all three are
under threat from the CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This does not mean our
friends need to agree with us all the time---it merely means standing up
for national self-interest when it diverges, as it often will, from
China's. **[[An effective counter]{.underline}]{.mark}**-Finlandization
**[[strategy should emphasize three things: material power, allies, and
values]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Taken collectively, these elements
constitute not only the foundation of an effective strategy but the
sources of American national strength. Just as we have examined the
sources of the CCP's conduct**[[, we must understand our competitive
advantages]{.mark}]{.underline}** and ground our strategy in the
enduring American principles **[[that have made us the most powerful
nation]{.underline}]{.mark}** in history. **[[This begins with material
power, both economic and military.]{.underline}]{.mark}** American
economic power did not emerge out of thin air. Our open economy, free
society, and respect for the rule of law created a culture of innovation
and hard work that catapulted America to the forefront of the global
economy. We have regulatory burdens, rent-seeking behavior, and special
interest capture, to be sure, but our system remains one that gives
confidence to investors and entrepreneurs. [This is a core
advantage]{.underline}, and one we would do well to preserve. As the
global economy increasingly depends upon advanced---and easily
manipulated--- technologies, the private sector must voluntarily step up
for the good of the nation and its own bottom line. Industry will need
to make hard choices about the security of its information technology
supply chains in China and research cooperation on dual-use technologies
with the CCP. In particular, Silicon Valley, a leader in the corporate
social responsibility movement, should modernize its conception of
social responsibility to exclude technology partnerships with the CCP
that are likely to lead to human rights abuses or the development of
advanced weapons systems. We must ensure that the technologies that will
shape the future of the global economy belong to the United States---and
not the CCP. Going hand in hand with economic power is American military
power. Our foremost goal must to be ensure that the relative gap between
U.S. and Chinese military capabilities is so wide that everyone---allies
and adversaries alike---understands that any military conflict would end
in a decisive U.S. victory. This is not just about winning a potential
fight; it is about establishing a favorable peacetime condition in which
allies and partners feel secure and Chinese leaders know that attempted
coercion, even of smaller states, is futile. This will not come cheaply.
But as former Defense Secretary James Mattis
[put](https://dod.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/1702965/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-on-national-defense-strategy/)
it, "America can afford survival." Building on recent defense budget
growth, the U.S. government must follow at the very least the National
Defense Strategy Commission's plan for three to five percent real annual
growth in the defense budget to build force structure and
next-generation
capabilities.[14](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/05/09/the-sources-of-ccp-conduct/#_ftn14)
Furthermore, policymakers should focus on preventing what National
Defense Strategy architect Elbridge Colby has
[described](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/05/how-to-win-americas-next-war-china-russia-military-infrastructure/)as
"the most pointed form" of a potential Chinese attack: a fait accompli
in which the People's Liberation Army quickly seized territory and then
raised the costs of a prospective counterattack to a level that would
cause the United States to balk. The National Defense Strategy,
punctuated by an under-appreciated shift from deterrence by punishment
to deterrence by denial, is designed to do just this. Congress must
exercise vigorous oversight to ensure the Pentagon follows through on
this transformational shift. America's friends, allies, and partners
constitute the second component of a counter-Finlandization strategy.
Due to far-sighted policies implemented after World War II, the United
States now enjoys a strong alliance system in the Indo-Pacific and
beyond. [[The U.S. government must seize on every opportunity to draw
closer to regional powers like Australia, Japan, South Korea, India, and
Taiwan, while also seeking out emerging partners that share common
interests.]{.mark}]{.underline} Simply put, **[[we are the away team in
the Indo-Pacific, and we will not be able to prevent Finlandization
without establishing close working relationships with regional allies
and partners]{.underline}]{.mark}**.Simply put, we are the away team in
the Indo-Pacific, and we will not be able to prevent Finlandization
without establishing close working relationships with regional allies
and partners.**[[Nurturing local allies gives us greater military,
political, and economic access and creates options for dealing with
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the Chinese academic Yan Xuetong
[wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/21/opinion/how-china-can-defeat-america.html)
in 2011, "t[[he core of competition between China and the United States
will be to see who has more high-quality friends." Critically, this
competition for friends is not limited to the
Indo-Pacific.]{.mark}]{.underline} The CCP is trying to drive wedges
between the United States and its partners wherever and whenever it can.
Nowhere is this more apparent than with the Five Eyes intelligence
sharing alliance at the heart of America's global coalition. In recent
weeks, China has exposed a critical gap in America's "special
relationship" with the United Kingdom over its [reported
decision](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48126974) to allow Huawei
onto its 5G network---a decision which ultimately cost Defense Secretary
Gavin Williamson his job. At the same time, New Zealand has
[indicated](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-07/nz-says-it-will-find-a-win-win-in-belt-and-road-strategy/11085564)
it will work with China on One Belt, One Road, which Secretary of State
Michael Pompeo has strongly
[criticized](https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2019/03/290753.htm)
for its "predatory lending practices." Given that China has been able to
score victories of this scale among the innermost core of the American
coalition, it is not hard to imagine how the CCP will exploit and
exacerbate tensions with other American partners. Strengthening
relationships with allies, friends, and partners will take actions both
large and small. The administration should return to the congressional
intent behind national security tariffs and end Section 232 actions and
investigations against our allies. At the same time, the administration
should offer and prioritize expanded trade relationships with countries
that make responsible decisions such as banning firms like Huawei and
ZTE from their future 5G networks and declining to join One Belt, One
Road. Meanwhile, to fortify democratic governments, non-profits,
academia, and the media should get to work on a public "United Front
Tracker," as
[suggested](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.hudson.org/files/publications/JonasFINAL.pdf)
by the Hudson Institute's Jonas Parello-Plesner, that would shed light
on ongoing CCP interference campaigns abroad. Finally, we need to better
incorporate values as a foundational element of our strategy. In 1946,
Kennan challenged the U.S. government to "formulate and put forward for
other nations a much more positive and constructive picture of sort of
world we would like to see than we have put forward in past." As we
think about what sort of world we would like to see---and how we should
best communicate it---we could do a lot worse than grounding this vision
in an expression of our foundational values: our internal sources of
conduct outlined in our Constitution and the Declaration of
Independence. This vision of equality, liberty, and the rule of law is a
self-evident contrast to the future offered by the CCP. This is a
contrast the U.S. government should draw explicitly and relentlessly,
highlighting the human rights atrocities in the Xinjiang concentration
camps, imposing harsh sanctions on the individuals responsible (like
Communist Party Secretary for Xinjiang Chen Quanguo), and cutting off
the flow of U.S. technology that enables repressive systems[. If we fail
to articulate the difference between our values---and our actions---and
those of the CCP, we will be waging great power competition with one
hand tied behind our back]{.underline}. At the same time, if we abandon
these values and instead try to "out China China"---going further down
the road of social control, government antagonizing business through
executive fiat, or reducing protections for privacy and free speech---we
will lose our way. As Kennan put it: "the greatest danger that can
befall us in coping with this problem of Soviet communism, is that we
shall allow ourselves to become like those with whom we are coping." By
better understanding our adversary and ourselves, we can avoid this
outcome, prevent our friends, allies and partners from falling victim to
Finlandization, and in the long run, leave the CCP on the ash heap of
history.

[[In 2018, China's]{.mark} [arms sales increased]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[continuing a trend that enabled China to become the world's
fastest-growing arms supplier]{.mark} [during the past 15
years]{.mark}]{.underline}. From 2013 through 2017, China was the
world's fourth-largest arms supplier, completing more than \$25 billion
worth of arms sales. [China sold military equipment worth more than \$10
billion to the Middle East. Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, Iraq, and the
United Arab Emirates accounted for most of China's arms sales in the
region. [The Indo-Pacific]{.underline} region [was China's
second-largest]{.underline} regional arms [market,]{.underline} [with
more than \$8 billion worth of]{.underline} arms [sales]{.underline},
[more than \$5 billion of which was to Pakistan]{.underline}. Contracts
signed within the past few years for guided rockets, ballistic missiles,
armed UAVs, submarines, and surface warships sustained sales growth for
Chinese arms exporters. The Aviation Industry of China (AVIC), an
exporter of armed UAVs and fixed-wing aircraft, claimed in a rare public
statement that it secured record profits in 2017, illustrating [[China's
rising profile]{.underline}]{.mark} [[among]{.underline}]{.mark} the
world's most prolific [[arms suppliers]{.underline}]{.mark}. [China's
ability to remain among the world's top five global arms
suppliers]{.underline} largely [[hinges on]{.mark}]{.underline}
continued [[strong sales to key Middle East and Indo-Pacific
customers,]{.mark} [as well as]{.mark}]{.underline} sustained [[demand
for its armed UAVs]{.mark}]{.underline} and precision-strike weapons. \>
Precision-Strike Weapons. Filling another niche in the global arms
market, China has sold precision-guided rockets and ballistic missile
systems, though it typically does not identify countries purchasing
these types of arms. Industry reports in 2018 highlighted sales of
Chinesemade WS-3A and WS-22 satellite-guided rockets, as well as several
export variant ballistic missile systems (the M20, BP-12, and Joint
Attack Rocket and Missile systems). \> Naval Combatants. China's naval
warship sales have also surged since 2015, highlighted by Pakistan's
purchase of eight YUAN variant submarines for more than \$3 billion.
Thailand also purchased one YUAN variant submarine in 2017 and has
expressed interest in purchasing two more. To date, China has not
delivered any YUAN variants, though it delivered two MING-class
submarines to Bangladesh in 2016. Also, in 2017 and 2018, China sold
frigates to Bangladesh (two Type 053H3s) and Pakistan (four Type 054As),
and donated one unspecified frigate to Sri Lanka.
[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} arms sales operate through state-run
export organizations such as AVIC and North Industries Corporation
(NORINCO) that primarily seek to generate profits. [[Arms
transfers]{.mark} also [are]{.mark} a component of China's foreign
policy, [used]{.mark} [in conjunction with other types of military,
economic]{.mark} aid, [and development assistance]{.mark} [to support
broader foreign policy goals]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These include
[securing]{.mark} [access]{.mark} [to]{.mark} natural [resources]{.mark}
[and export markets, promoting]{.mark} [political influence]{.mark}
among host country elites, [and]{.mark} [building]{.mark} [support in

recipients]{.underline}]{.mark} are developing countries that [tend to
[buy Chinese]{.mark} arms [because]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} are less expensive than comparable systems
sold by other arms manufactures. Although Chinese arms are considered by
some potential customers to be of lower quality and reliability, many
Chinese systems are offered with enticements such as gifts, donations,
and flexible payment options. Some Chinese systems include advanced
capabilities. Chinese arms also [tend to [carry
few]{.mark}]{.underline}er [[end-use restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and are monitored less rigorously than competitors']{.mark} arms
[exports]{.mark}, [a factor that attracts customers with less access

#### Unipolarity is sustainable and creates a structural disincentive for great power war and escalation -- power vacuums causes cascade prolif and extinction

Hal **Brands 15**. On the faculty at the Sanford School of Public Policy
at Duke University The Elliott School of International Affairs The
Washington Quarterly Summer 2015 38:2 pp. 7--28

The fundamental reason is that [both U.S. [influence and international
stability are]{.mark} **thoroughly [interwoven with a robust U.S.
forward presence]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Regarding influence, [the
protection that Washington has afforded its allies has equally afforded
the United States great sway over those allies' policies]{.underline}.43
[During the Cold War and after]{.underline}, for instance,
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
used the influence provided by its security posture to veto allies'
**pursuit of nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, [to obtain more
advantageous **terms in financial and trade agreements**]{.underline},
and even to affect the composition of allied nations' governments.44
More broadly, it has used its alliances as vehicles for shaping
political, security, and economic agendas in key regions and bilateral
relationships, thus giving the United States an outsized voice on a
range of important issues. To be clear, this influence has never been as
pervasive as U.S. officials might like, or as some observers might
imagine. But by any reasonable standard of comparison, it has
nonetheless been remarkable. **[One can tell a similar story about
[the]{.mark} relative [stability of the]{.mark} post-war
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As even some leading offshore balancers
have acknowledged[, the [lack of]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark} in regions
like Europe in recent decades **[is not something that]{.mark} has
[occurred naturally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It]{.mark} has [occurred
**because the "American pacifier" has suppressed**]{.mark} **precisely
the [dynamics that previously fostered geopolitical
turmoil]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That pacifier has **limited arms races
and security competitions by providing the protection that allows other
countries to under-build their militaries**. It has soothed historical
rivalries by affording a climate of security in which powerful countries
like Germany and Japan could be revived economically and **reintegrated
into** thriving and fairly cooperative **regional orders**.]{.underline}
[It has [induced caution in]{.mark} the behavior of **[allies and
adversaries]{.mark} alike**, **[deterring aggression and
dissuading]{.mark} other [destabilizing behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
As John Mearsheimer has noted, the United States "effectively acts as a
night watchman," lending order to an otherwise disorderly and anarchical
environment.45 [What would happen [if Washington backed away]{.mark}
from this role]{.underline}? The most logical answer is that **[both
U.S. influence and [global stability would
suffer]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [With respect to influence,]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[would]{.underline} effectively [be **surrendering the most powerful
bargaining chip** it has traditionally wielded in dealing with friends
and allies,]{.underline} [and jeopardizing the position of leadership it
has used to shape bilateral and regional **agendas for
decades**]{.underline}. **[The consequences would seem no less damaging
where stability is concerned]{.underline}**. As offshore balancers have
argued, it may be that U.S. retrenchment would force local powers to
spend more on defense, while perhaps assuaging certain points of
friction with countries that feel threatened or encircled by U.S.
presence. But it equally stands to reason that [removing the American
pacifier would **liberate the more destabilizing influences that U.S.
policy had previously stifled**]{.underline}. [Long-dormant **[security
competitions]{.mark} might [reawaken as countries armed
themselves]{.mark}** more vigorously]{.underline}; **[historical
[antagonisms]{.mark}]{.underline}** [between old rivals might
**[reemerge]{.mark} in the absence of a robust U.S. presence** and the
reassurance it provides]{.underline}. Moreover, [countries that seek to
revise existing regional orders in their favor]{.underline}---think
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** in **[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
or **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Asia---might indeed [[applaud
U.S. retrenchment]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [they might just as
plausibly feel empowered to more assertively press their
interests]{.underline}. If the United States has been a kind of
Leviathan in key regions, Mearsheimer acknowledges, then "**[take away
that Leviathan and there is likely to be big trouble]{.underline}**."46
Scanning the global horizon today, **[one can easily see where such
trouble might arise]{.underline}**. [In Europe,]{.underline} [a
revisionist Russia is already destabilizing its neighbors and contesting
the post-Cold War settlement in the region.]{.underline} [In the Gulf
and broader Middle East, the threat of Iranian ascendancy has stoked
region-wide tensions manifesting in **proxy wars** and hints of an
**incipient arms race**, even as that region also contends with a severe
threat to its stability in the form of the Islamic State. In East Asia,
**a rising China is challenging the regional status quo** in numerous
ways, sounding alarms among its neighbors---many of whom also have
historical grievances against each other.]{.underline} In these
circumstances, [**[removing the]{.mark} American [pacifier would]{.mark}
likely yield not low-cost stability, but [increase]{.mark}**d
**[conflict]{.mark} and upheaval.** That conflict and
upheaval]{.underline}, in turn, **[would be quite damaging to U.S.
interests]{.underline}** even if it did not result in the nightmare
scenario of a hostile power dominating a key region. **[It is hard to
imagine]{.underline}**, for instance, **[that increased instability and
acrimony would produce the robust multilateral cooperation necessary to
deal with transnational threats from pandemics to piracy]{.underline}**.
**[More problematic still might be the economic
consequences.]{.underline}** As scholars like Michael Mandelbaum have
argued, [the enormous progress toward global prosperity and integration
that has occurred since World War II]{.underline} (and now the Cold War)
[has come in the climate of relative stability and security provided
largely by the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.47 [One
simply cannot confidently predict that this **progress would endure amid
[escalating geopolitical competition]{.mark} in regions of enormous
importance to the world economy.**]{.underline} Perhaps [the greatest
risk that a strategy of offshore balancing would run]{.underline}, of
course, **[is that a key region might not be able to maintain its own
balance following U.S. retrenchment]{.underline}**. That prospect might
have seemed far-fetched in the early post-Cold War era, and it remains
unlikely in the immediate future. But [**in East Asia particularly,**
the rise and growing assertiveness of China has highlighted the medium-
to long-term danger that a hostile power could in fact **gain regional
primacy**]{.underline}. [If China's economy continues to grow
rapidly]{.underline}, and if Beijing continues to increase military
spending by 10 percent or more each year, [then its neighbors will
ultimately face grave challenges in containing Chinese power **even if
they join forces in that endeavor**]{.underline}. This possibility,
ironically, is one to which leading advocates of retrenchment have been
attuned. "The United States will have to play a key role in countering
China," Mearshimer writes, "because its Asian neighbors are not strong
enough to do it by themselves."48 If this is true, however, then
**[offshore balancing becomes a dangerous and potentially self-defeating
strategy]{.underline}**. As mentioned above, [it [could lead]{.mark}
countries like [Japan and]{.mark} South [Korea to **seek nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [stoking arms races and
elevating regional tensions]{.underline}. Alternatively, and perhaps
more worryingly, [it might encourage the scenario that offshore
balancers seek to avoid, by easing China's **ascent to regional
hegemony.**]{.underline} As Robert Gilpin has written,
"[[Retrenchment]{.mark} by its very nature is **an indication of
relative weakness** and **declining power**, and thus retrenchment [can
have a **deteriorating effect on relations** ]{.mark}**with allies and
rivals**]{.underline}."[49 In East Asia today, U.S. allies rely on U.S.
reassurance to navigate increasingly fraught relationships with a more
assertive China precisely **because they understand that they will have
great trouble balancing Beijing on their own**]{.underline}. A
significant U.S. retrenchment might therefore tempt these countries to
acquiesce to, or bandwagon with, a rising China if they felt that
prospects for successful resistance were diminishing as the United
States retreated.50 In the same vein, retrenchment would compromise
alliance relationships, basing agreements, and other assets that might
help Washington check Chinese power in the first place---and that would
allow the United States to surge additional forces into theater in a
crisis. In sum, if one expects that Asian countries will be unable to
counter China themselves, then reducing U.S. influence and leverage in
the region is a curious policy. Offshore balancing might promise to
preserve a stable and advantageous environment while reducing U.S.
burdens. But upon closer analysis, the probable outcomes of the strategy
seem more perilous and destabilizing than its proponents acknowledge.

#### The US is boosting arms sales to bolster US leadership now -- restrictions reverse that and cause China to fill in

**Majumadar 18** Dave Majumdar, defense editor for the National
Interest. 8-9-2018. The Trump Administration Has a Plan to Compete with
Russia and China over Weapon Sales. National Interest.

/jh

The [Trump]{.underline} Administration [is hoping to boost the export
prospects for American weapons systems to allied countries]{.underline}
by modifying policies and streamlining the bureaucratic process. The
Trump Administration announced a revised conventional arms transfer
policy in April, but that is just the first step. There are more policy
changes coming down the line.

"[The]{.underline} new policy reflects the [priorities]{.underline} of
the president's National Security Strategy," Ambassador Tina Kaidanow,
Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, said
on Aug. 8 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"Which [are]{.underline}, namely, [to preserve peace through strength by
reforming regulations]{.underline} to facilitate the exports of U.S.
military equipment; to [strengthen partners and allies; to facilitate
U.S. economic security and innovation."]{.underline}

Under the new policy, the United States hopes to make its export
bureaucracy more proactive and cut red tape in the process.

"These steps are among the first in what we hope will be a series of
efforts to streamline the arms transfer process," Kaidanow said.

"I can assure you that my colleagues and I at the State Department, but
also again more broadly in the USG, will continue exploring ways to cut
red tape and give U.S. industry every advantage in an increasingly
competitive global marketplace, while continuing to ensure the
responsible export of arms."

The United States is making these policy changes with great power
competition with China and Russia in mind.

"We're trying to improve our ability to compete with our adversaries by
providing our partners with viable alternatives to foreign products in
order to maintain influence in key regions throughout the world," Laura
Cressey, Deputy Director for Regional Security and Arms Transfers at
U.S. Department of State, said.

"We're going to be working with our partners and allies to identify
critical capability requirements that they have and then trying to
expedite transfers to support these essential foreign policy and
national security objectives."

However, writing the policy guidance is the easy part. Implementing the
policy will be far more challenging.

"The release of the new policy was only the first step in a series of
what we believe will be very practical results-focused initiatives to
transform the way that the U.S. government works to support and grow our
defense industrial base," Kaidanow said.

"Through that memorandum, the president also directed the secretary of
state, in coordination with the secretaries of defense, commerce, and
energy, to submit an implementation plan within 60 days."

As part of the effort, the United States is looking at reforming export
hurdles such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which has
been a vexing problem for the defense industry for decades.

"[We'll look at streamlining]{.underline} the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations, or [ITAR, and also continuing to revise the U.S.
Munitions List and the Commerce Control List,"]{.underline} Cressey
said.

Additionally, the State Department and Defense Department will try to
speed up the bureaucratic processes involved in weapons exports.

"We will also be looking at the day-to-day processes to ensure that we
are as efficient, as streamlined, and as effective as possible," Cressey
said.

"So some of the things that we're looking at, and that folks in industry
and associations have asked us to look at, is: establishing milestones
and timelines for the foreign military sales process; improving and
speeding up our contracting process -- processes within the Defense
Department; trying to increase the competitiveness of U.S. defense items
and systems by building in exportability to the design and development;
and also by expanding support for what we call non-program-of-record
systems. We're looking into potential financing options that could make
our systems more attainable for our foreign partners. And we're also
examining existing polices to ensure that they don't unnecessarily
detract from our ability to compete in international -- in the
international marketplace."

Without the changes, [the United States is increasingly in danger of
losing its market share as China]{.underline}, in particular,
[increasing develops and produces evermore-capable weapons for the
export market.]{.underline} One example is the Unmanned Aerial Systems
([UAS]{.underline}) [market]{.underline}, [which the United States
dominates]{.underline}, but which [is also threatened by Chinese
competition and by Washington's tight export regulations.]{.underline}

"By removing some of the previous administration's artificial barriers
to the transfer of arms to critical partners, the UAS export policy
being one example, [this administration is both strengthening our hand
in the ongoing strategic competition while also stimulating economic
growth at home, as well as job creation]{.underline}," Alex Gray,
Special Assistant to the President for the Defense Industrial Base,
said.

"It should be noted that the [U.S. aerospace and defense industries
contribute almost \$1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy]{.underline}
and they support about 2.5 million American jobs. Just as one point, the
international -- [UAS export market alone is estimated to be worth more
than \$50 billion a year within the next decade]{.underline}. Those are
the stakes we're competing for."

[Those nations that are unable to purchase American weapons could find
that China or Russia are more than willing to supply them with
comparable systems.]{.underline}

"[We are witnessing China]{.underline} -- as an example, not alone --
but China [filling voids the U.S. left with a denial to a friend or
ally]{.underline}," Keith Webster, president of the Defense and
Aerospace Export Council at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said.

"The consequence of a denial filled by China or others is as follows:
[The U.S. loses market share that is not easily recaptured, and in some
cases will never be recaptured.]{.underline} The [U.S. loses control of
the capability. The U.S. loses the opportunity to train, influence, and
maintain a military relationship with foreign forces, who now are
introducing into their inventory a Chinese]{.underline} -- Korean,
Israeli, et cetera -- [capability]{.underline}."

There are some immediate examples that Webster said he could point to.
"[We never answered India's request for ballistic missile defense
capability]{.underline}."

"That ask of the U.S. went unanswered for a number of years. And [now,
India has been forced to consider]{.underline} and has -- may
potentially go buy, potentially, [the Russian S-400 system]{.underline}.
Similar to what Turkey's buying---or said they were going to buy. Now we
are rushing to put together a proposal for BMD for India to counter that
situation."

A competitive market not only encourages dealings with problematic
buyers but also creates pressure for technology transfer. Indeed, the
reluctance of the United States to export weapons production know-how
means that technology transfer is a key competitive A competitive market
not only encourages dealings with problematic buyers but also creates
pressure for technology transfer. Indeed, the reluctance of the United
States to export weapons production know-how means that technology
transfer is a key competitive advantage, indeed a necessity, for even as
sophisticated an exporter as France.its technology would not be given
to Turkey. In announcing the deal with Russia, Turkey\'s presidential
spokesman was frank: \"Let\'s say the price difference could have been
manageable. But the issue of technology transfer was more important. On
this issue, our allies, including the United States, caused a big
disappointment. \"25 Turkey explicitly seeks to enter the top echelon of
arms exporters, and under- stands it needs foreign technology to do
so.26 Should it fail, like so many [[aspiring]{.mark}
[exporters]{.mark}]{.underline} do, it will have consumed enormous
amounts of the country\'s resources to produce a product that could be
bought easily from any number of existing pro- ducers. Should it
succeed, it will join a very crowded field. [Growing
[competition]{.mark} [will lead to more
proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[fewer scruples about corruption
and human rights, and generous]{.underline}]{.mark} amounts of
[[technology transfer]{.underline}]{.mark} to clients. The consequences
of [a desperate [Russia\'s]{.mark} [freewheeling]{.mark} [export]{.mark}
[policies]{.mark} in the]{.underline} 19[90s]{.underline} and early
2000s clearly [[helped fuel China\'s own]{.underline}]{.mark}
[increasingly successful international sales push]{.underline}. 27
Finally, transferring technology and production to the client can hinder
human rights and anti-corruption efforts in more direct ways. For
example, shifting production of sensitive components to third-party
countries has allowed German defense firms to skirt their home
country\'s export regulations.28 And [the entry of desperate second-tier
suppliers shapes U.S. behavior in turn]{.underline}. [The presence of
alternate sources, also known as [the \"gray threat]{.mark},\" [has an
effect even on the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [as shown by the
recent U.S. decision to resume military]{.mark} aid and most
[sales]{.mark} [to Egypt]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Thailand presents a
similar example]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, the Thai military\'s traditional supplier, largely
[ceased]{.underline} both [arms sales]{.underline} and military
assistance [after that country\'s]{.underline} 2014 [coup]{.underline}.
[Thailand]{.underline} accordingly [pro- cured weapons from relatively
new suppliers, such as China, Russia, and Ukraine]{.underline}, [and has
strengthened ties with]{.underline} suppliers from [Israel, Sweden,
and]{.underline} other countries in [Europe]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is now resuming much of its
sales to that country]{.underline}.

### UQ: China sales low (generic)

#### China sales lower than US because of post-WWII alliances, but they are fragile because of Trump.

International policy digest - Nate Kerkhoff - 14 JUN 2019 - Nate
Kerkhoff is the Asia-Pacific Fellow for the Young Leaders in Foreign
Policy organization, and received his Master\'s in global affairs from
Yonsei University in Seoul.

For the past ten years or so, officials from [[China and the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark} have carefully avoided the moniker 'rivalry'
to describe their relationship. Nevertheless, the two nations [[have
been engaging in increasingly high stakes competitions
in]{.underline}]{.mark} many arenas, notably for influence in [[the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark} region. This was on full display at
the recent Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. China Minister of Defense
Wei Fenghe warned against outside countries interfering in China's
affairs, and United States acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan
reaffirmed the United States' intention to maintain its strategic
position in what Washington now officially calls the "Indo-Pacific." In
this thinly veiled adversarial posture, some point to figures that seem
to indicate an advantage for Beijing, notably its commercial dominance
in the region and rapidly developing military capabilities, not to
mention US President Donald Trump's aversion to multilateralism. One
number, however, receives less attention but is a major factor
explaining why in the burgeoning competition for dominance in East Asia,
[[China still trails far behind the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}
and may never truly overtake it: one, the number of China's formal
allies. The United States' constellation of alliances and defense
agreements have provided partner nations with Washington-backed
collective security guarantees, allowing them to devote more resources
to developing their economies and participate in the rules-based
international trade network. [[It is largely through partnerships
grounded in these values the United States has been able to maintain the
so-called 'Liberal World Order' since the end of World War
II.]{.underline}]{.mark} In the Asia-Pacific, the U.S. has collective
defense agreements with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea,
Thailand, and New Zealand. It is deepening defense ties with Singapore
and India, and even building security relations with Vietnam. China's
lone treaty ally? North Korea, the region's poorest country. These
formal and informal partnerships are the United States' best assets for
maintaining defensive influence in China's backyard. Even as
Washington's economic clout erodes and the uncertainties surrounding the
Trump administration mount, military ties between Washington and its
partners in the region run deep. Allied nations collaborate with the
United States on efforts such as monitoring illicit activities from
North Korea and defying China's claims over the South China Sea.
Beijing's lack of military friends is a large obstacle on its path to
dominance in the region, and cannot be overcome with trade and
investment alone. Without allies, China struggles to form effective
coalitions to advance its agenda on the world stage. The Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), China's multi-continental development megaproject,
does not guarantee Beijing preeminent influence in patron countries
because countries prioritize security concerns, sometimes at the expense
of economic opportunity. The Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, which carefully tracks global arms sales, a bellwether for
nations' defense priorities, notes that though [[China has greatly
increased its arms exports, client nations are mostly in the Middle East
and Sub-Saharan Africa.]{.underline}]{.mark} Australia, India, South
Korea, and Vietnam, four of the world's top weapons importers, per
policy will not purchase Chinese-made arms. Conversely, five of the
United States' top arms clients by volume of export are in the region
(2. Australia, 4. South Korea, 6. Japan, 7. Singapore, 10.Taiwan). In
the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte boisterously stated his
intent to move closer to Beijing's orbit when he came to office in 2016.
Over the past three years, however, the Philippines has maintained
productive military relations with the United States, an ally since
1951. Now, as tensions rise in the South China Sea, Manila has
criticized Beijing and is even reportedly in discussion with Washington
about deploying an American-made rocket system. This has parallels with
another issue involving a different US ally in the neighborhood. In
2016-2017, South Korea installed a controversial American-made missile
defense system. China took swift vengeance, and the ensuing sanctions
against Seoul resulted in an estimated loss of nearly \$16 billion for
South Korea. In the end, though, South Korea held firm and China
relented. The system still stands and Beijing has mended ruptured
economic ties. China's heavy-handed measures provide plenty of evidence
in the United States' case to keep allies and non-allies alike on its
side[[. According to research firm Pew Global, in terms of world
leadership, countries favor the United States over China by a large
margin.]{.underline}]{.mark} The survey notes this trend is particularly
acute in the Asia Pacific region. With that said, the United States also
has a responsibility to lead with the values it unabashedly promotes. It
would be foolish to count on the automatic loyalty of allied nations
seeking an alternative to the bully in Beijing. This means refraining
from publicly humiliating, price gouging or threatening its partners. It
also means setting an example at home, such as not invoking race-based
grounds for confronting China. [[Even if America's friends do not defect
from the United States' security guarantees, it is in Washington's best
interests to strengthen]{.mark}]{.underline} these [[bonds in order to
maximize its advantage over Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the coming
years, competition for regional influence between China and the United
States will increase in scope. Though China may be closing the gap in
many measures as it continues its march towards super power status, in
times of need, the majority of leaders in the Asia-Pacific still dial
Washington. Until Beijing can offer neighboring countries peace of mind
in security on top of the favorable trade deals, the Pacific Century
will belong to the United States and its friends.

#### China sales low - Marketing troubles, product failure, closed markets, high prices, lack of maintenance or training services

**[Zhen 19]{.underline}** - Liu Zhen -- South China Morning Post - Jun,

The biennial Airshow China expo in Zhuhai, which starts on Tuesday, will
showcase many advanced, Chinese-made weapons to potential customers in
Asia and Africa. More than 900 Chinese weapons will be on display,
according to the organiser of the six-day show, which will feature more
than 700 exhibitors from more than 42 countries and regions -- with more
than 400 exhibitors from China alone. Another important factor is that
major importers of arms lack the required political trust in China But
while military experts say the quality of cheaper Chinese weapons has
improved, [[Chinese manufacturers are still struggling to build brands
in an international market dominated by competitors from the United
States and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. At September's Africa Aerospace
and Defence air show in Pretoria, South Africa, Chinese exhibitors
struggled to find buyers even though Beijing tried hard to secure sales
of its L-15 Falcon trainer and JF-17 fighter, Andrei Chang, [[the
founder of military magazine Kanwa Asian Defence]{.underline}]{.mark},
told the South China Morning Post. He said Cameroon [[had received four
Harbin Z-9 attack helicopters from China]{.underline}]{.mark} after
Beijing offered a US\$100 million loan last year, [[but one of them had
crashed soon after being handed over]{.underline}]{.mark}. Cameroon was
still negotiating with China over the accident and had [[no any plans to
buy any more Chinese weapons due to quality
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}, Chang said. Professor Jonathan Holslag,
head of research at the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China
Studies, said [[financial problems were causing many countries,
including South Africa, to be more hesitant and cautious when purchasing
new arms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Philippines' Duterte eyes arms from
China, ends joint patrols with United States "There is also fierce
competition and many countries are willing to make offers at knockdown
prices," Holslag said, adding that many of Beijing's previous clients
harboured quality concerns. "[[Military sales come with important
maintenance and training services and China has still a way to go in
this regard]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said. Chinese arms manufacturers
may find it even more challenging to make sales following the reported
failure of Chinese-made C-705 anti-ship missiles to hit their targets
during an Indonesian exercise in September that was watched by
Indonesian President Joko Widodo. PLA unveils new weapons for air and
sea combat following Hague tribunal ruling IHS Jane's reported that two
C-705 missiles failed to hit their targets after being fired from two of
the Indonesian navy's KCR-40-class missile attack craft during the
large-scale Armada Jaya 2016 exercise in the Java Sea on September 14.
Indonesia had acquired a licence that would allow state-owned aircraft
maker PT Dirgantara Indonesia to produce C-705 missiles locally by 2017
or 2018, according to an earlier report in The Jakarta Post. It is not
clear whether the licence contract will be affected by the failed
launch, but Chinese military experts said the poor performance of the
C-705, a high-subsonic missile guided by the US Global Positioning
System (GPS) or Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS),
might have an adverse short-term impact on international sales of
Chinese-made weapons. "It's impossible to make sure all missiles can hit
any targets accurately," said military observer Zhou Chenming, who
previously worked for a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and
Technology Corporation, the main state-owned contractor for the
country's space programme, and is now a researcher at the Knowfar
Institute for Strategic and Defence Studies, a non-government think tank
in Jiangyin, Jiangsu province. "Normally, a manufacturer would note a
general kill probability at 90 to 95 per cent during range tests. From
tanks to carrier killers: 10 weapons unveiled at China\'s military
parade "When a missile is fired, human factors play the key role during
the intermediate operations to decide whether it will hit its designated
target, including a series of reference data such as what altitude it
needs to ascend to in the first stage and when it needs to turn." Zhou
said the capabilities of the C-705 missile and the shorter-range C-701
and C-704 models had been proven in recent attacks by Iranian-backed
Houthi rebels in Yemen on United Arab Emirates vessels that were part of
a Saudi Arabian-backed coalition supporting the Yemeni government.
Beijing-based naval expert Li Jie said local weather, and whether the
Indonesian missiles operators had followed all the necessary procedures,
would also affect the launch result. "Weapons are made with various
metals and other sensitive materials, so local weather like temperature,
humidity, salinity may cause problems," Li said, adding that the climate
in China was very different from that in Indonesia. Li cited the example
of at least six crashes by Russian Sukhoi Su-30 series jet fighters in
India from 2009 to 2015, whereas similar problems were not encountered
by the Vietnamese and Indonesian air forces or China's People's
Liberation Army Air Force. A comprehensive report in June last year by
the Russian website Russia Beyond the Headlines said that India's harsh
climate, different training requirements and problematic maintenance
systems were all key reasons behind the crashes. The report said Sukhoi
kept a close eye on products sold overseas as part of its after-sales
service. Military experts said that was something Chinese arms producers
would need to emulate in the longer term if they hoped to build up brand
names for their weapons in the international market. "Many countries
decide to buy weapons from the US and Russia just because of the
security guarantees, similar to an alliance, which China is so far is
incapable of giving to its African and Asian clients," Zhou said. Made
in China: Beijing to show off 100s of new weapons at grand memorial war
parade as rehearsals get under way Dr Rajeev Ranjan Chaturvedy, a
research associate at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the
National University of Singapore, said China's defence industry was
getting bigger but the quality of the weapons it produced was not the
best. "I do not think that China has built its brand in the field of
global weapon exports \... but in recent years, China has been paying a
lot of attention on research and innovation," he said. "Certainly,
cutting-edge technology will be very critical in shaping the global arms
market. [[The US and some other countries are way ahead of China in
defence research and manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark} \... another
important factor is that major importers of arms lack the required
political trust in China, and China doesn't figure at the top of many
countries' priority lists for arms procurement." Zhou said political
trust was a key factor behind the new Sri Lankan government's reluctance
to commit to Chinese arms purchase agreements signed by its predecessor.
China and US in silent fight for supremacy beneath waves of South China
Sea Last month's Chinese-language Kanwa Defence Review also reported
that Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, who assumed office in
January last year, might renege on Chinese weapons deals. In an
exclusive interview with Chang, Air Chief Marshal Kolitha Gunathilake,
Sri Lanka's Chief of Defence Staff, denied rumours it had signed a JF-17
contract with China or Pakistan and said Sri Lanka had decided against
making such a purchase. "I didn't make final decision, so far I've just
watched a demonstration of the JF-17's flight simulator on the ground,"
he said. Gunathilake said Sri Lanka did need to buy new generation
aircraft to replace its ageing Chinese J-7s and Russian MiG-27s and was
considering buying second-hand F-16s from the US. "[[The problem is it's
too expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said. Li said that in order to

are using Chinese military equipment according to The Military Balance
2016 report published in February by the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). It described Africa as an
increasingly important market for China's defence exports, with Nigeria,
Uganda and Djibouti among 10 countries that had become "emergent
customers" for Beijing's arms exports since 2005. VIPs flock to Zhuhai
airshow as J-31 stealth fighter takes to the skies But China still
accounted for only 5.9 per cent of global arms exports from 2011-2015,
according to a recent report on global arms transfers by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), well behind the US and
Russia, the world's two largest arms exporters. The SIPRI report said
China had supplied major arms to 37 states between 2011 and 2015, but 75
per cent of its exports were to states in Asia and Oceania. Pakistan was
the main recipient of Chinese exports, accounting for 35 per cent of the
total, followed by Bangladesh (20 per cent) and Myanmar (16 per cent).
The PLA Daily reported recently that China had spared no efforts to
expand overseas markets, with submarines, missiles and fighter jets
being among the sophisticated weapons exported to neighbours. It added
that Beijing would be transferring at least 13 submarines worth a total
of about US\$6.2 billion in the coming years, with eight going to
Pakistan, three to Thailand and two to Bangladesh. The 11 modified
diesel-electric attack submarines destined for Pakistan and Thailand,
which analysts speculate will be a lighter, export version of the PLA
Navy's Type 041 Yuan-class conventional attack submarine, might feature
air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems allowing the submarines to stay
submerged for longer.

[The latest report on global arms transfers from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) shows that, during the
latest five-year study period (2014--2018), arms transfers rose 8 % from
the previous period (2009--2013). Three-quarters of global arms
transfers involved the United States (36 %), Russia (21 %), France (7
%), Germany (6 %) and China (5 %). [The volume of China's arms transfers
in 2014--2018 rose by less than 3 % from the 2009--2013 period**. The

the boom years at the start of this decade.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The
number of customer countries, however, increased from the previous
five-year period from 41 to 53 countries, even if arms supplies
continued to focus on Pakistan (37 % share), Bangladesh (16 %) and
Algeria (11 %). **[[China's arms export possibilities are limited by

capabilities, China was the world's sixth largest importer of arms in
the 2014--2018 period after Saudi Arabia, India, Egypt, Australia and
Algeria, accounting for just over 4 % of global imports. Although the
volume of imports fell (down 7 % from the previous five-year period),
China is still dependent on imports of e.g. engines for fighter jets and
ships, and air defence missiles. Russia accounts for 70 % of Chinese
arms imports, France 10 % and Ukraine 9 %. The volume of Russian arms
exports dropped by 17 % during the 2014--2018 period relative to the
previous five-year period. SIPRI reports that much of the decline came
from a 42 % drop in exports to India and a total collapse in exports to
Venezuela. Even so, India is still Russia's top arms customer with 27 %
share, followed by China (14 %) and Algeria (14 %). Russia exports arms
to 55 countries. Asia and Oceania account for 60 % of exports, Africa 17
%, the Middle East 16 %, Europe 6 % and Americas just over 1 %. Russian
arms imports are insignificant at the moment.

### UQ: China has capacity (Generic)

#### China set to grow arms sales -- industrial base, payment flexibility, lack of restrictions

**Tao 18** Zhang Tao, 2-27-2018. In-depth: How China becomes
third-largest supplier of weapons worldwide? ChinaMil.
http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/view/2018-02/27/content_7953754.htm /jh

BEIJING, Feb. 27 (ChinaMil) \-- [China\'s share of global arms exports
rose from 3.8 percent to 6.2 percent from 2012 to 2016]{.underline} as
the country became the third-largest weapon supplier in the world after
the U.S. and Russia, according to the latest data released by the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

Data released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI).

The report on the global arms export market by SIPRI is based on public
reports from 2012 to 2016. However, [it is believed that China actually
exported more weapons because only some of the data were
published.]{.underline}

The following are the main reasons behind China\'s transformation from
an arms import country to the third-largest supplier of weapons.

First, [the improved and developed industrial system provides strong
material basis for weapons export.]{.underline}

[China has the most complete industrial system in the
world]{.underline}, covering almost all areas. In contrast, many highly
developed countries are now only engaged in several specialized areas
because they cannot afford to have a complete industrial system.

According to the UN standards of manufacturing, China does everything
from producing nails to manufacturing lunar rovers.

[China has the world\'s best thermal power plant]{.underline}
(supercritical unit), [hydropower station]{.underline} (largest
stand-alone capacity), [nuclear power plant]{.underline} (third and
fourth generation nuclear power plants), [power grids]{.underline} (UHV
power grids) [and one of its best refineries]{.underline} (Sinopec
Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company).

[China also has the world\'s best coal-to-liquids plant]{.underline},
the best oil extraction technology, the largest forging press, the best
large casting technology, [the largest load-bearing]{.underline}
computer numerical control ([CNC]{.underline}) [machine and the first
intelligent CNC machine.]{.underline}

China\'s land-based machinery, marine engineering machinery and
shipbuilding industry are also on the world\'s top tier. China\'s 5G
communications technology standards have been accepted globally. China
has two of the world\'s top five telecommunications equipment
manufacturers.

China\'s biomedicine industry is also rapidly developing. The research
and development of the country's high-end general-purpose chips, basic
software, core electronics and large integrated circuit equipment are
set for major breakthroughs.

China\'s industrial technology has continuously improved since China
became the largest industrialized country in the world in 2010 and now
provides a solid material foundation for the export of military
products.

Second, [China provides customers with a wide range of
options.]{.underline}

As of 2017[, China had a total of 11 major military-industrial
groups]{.underline} including China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC),
China Nuclear E&C Group (CNECC), China Aerospace Science and Technology
Corporation(CASC), China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation
(CASIC), Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), Aero Engine
Corporation of China (AECC), China State Shipbuilding Corporation
(CSSC), China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), China North
Industries Group Corporation (CNIGC), China South Industries Group
Corporation(CSGC) and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation
(CETGC).

[The strong R&D and production capabilities of those groups can provide
land, sea and air equipment systems including fighter jets, bombers,
transport aircraft, early warning aircraft, helicopters, main battle
tanks, self-propelled artillery, firearms, frigates, submarines, supply
ships and anti-ship missiles]{.underline}.

[China\'s customers are free to select a wide variety of combinations
according to their own needs.]{.underline} A major feature of modern
warfare is system confrontation. Weaponry of the same source can reduce
logistical workload and vulnerability, and more importantly, enables
rapid formation of system combat effectiveness, which is a vital
performance metric for customers.

The VT-4 tank is getting more and more popular in the international
market.

Third, [advanced concept design has made China\'s arms more
popular]{.underline}.

Since the Gulf War, the technological form of warfare has become more
and more information-based. Those with leading war concepts will have
the initiative in war. [China has made remarkable achievements in
applying advanced war concepts to the weapons and equipment available
for export. China\'s CH-4 integrated surveillance drone is a great
example.]{.underline}

The CH-4B drone used by the 100th Squadron of the Iraqi Air Force hit a
target at Ramadi for the first time, foreign media reported in April
2016. The CH-4B drone fired a HJ-10 missile and destroyed an ISIS
vehicle in the western part of Ramadi, according to foreign media.

With advanced sensor communication and aviation technologies, China\'s
CH-4 is capable of conducting accurate strikes against fixed targets and
moving targets from a long range. This fully reflects the trend of
future wars and is why the CH-4 is favored by developing countries.

There are reports claiming that China has substantially expanded its
presence in markets in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia, and
its share of the Latin American market has also been increasing. This
growth is largely related to the excellent cost performance of Chinese
military products.

Fourth, [flexible payment methods make business easier.]{.underline}

[The arms industry itself is highly monopolized.]{.underline} Moreover,
because of its strategic political significance, the monopoly has been
highly protected by various governments and has become a tool of
dominance.

In today's market economy, c[ountries that have no capacity
for]{.underline} research and development ([R&D)]{.underline} of arms
[can only import weapons]{.underline} at a high price from a small
number of exporters. [Buying these arms often requires hard currency \--
the US dollar.]{.underline}

Among big arms exporters, [China has the most flexible payment
terms.]{.underline}

In the arms trade between China and Venezuela, for example, China
exported a tank fire control system, ground-based air-defense radar
system, transport aircraft, amphibious infantry fighting vehicles and
large surface ships[. China agreed that Venezuela can use oil for
partial payment due to its economic dilemma.]{.underline}

In addition, China\'s exports of armored vehicles to Thailand are
financed with dried foodstuffs. The Chinese FD-2000 long-range air
defense missile systems exported to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are
exchanged for natural gas.

It can be said that [these flexible payment method have won many
customers for China\'s arms exports.]{.underline}

The picture shows the Chinese FD-2000 long-range air-defense missile
systems exported to Turkmenistan.

Fifth, [China does not set sales barriers for political
reasons.]{.underline}

Everyone thinks of the US when talking about political barriers.

As a reputable seller, [China never acts in an unsustainable manner in
the international arms market. China never makes political excuses and
always delivers according to the contract]{.underline}. The good
reputation has increased China\'s arms export year by year.

[Drones are a trump card in Chinese weapons\' export.]{.underline}

More cost-effective weapons and equipment made in China will be seen in
countries around the world with the continuous growth of China\'s
industrial capacity and civil-military integration.

It can also be expected that [as engine technology continues to improve,
China\'s share in the world\'s arms market will rise
further.]{.underline}

#### China is rapidly increasing and broadening their arm sales now to secure leadership

Secrecy), May 3 2019, "Rising China Sells More Weapons",

years,"]{.underline} according to the 2019 China Military Power report
published by the Department of Defense. "[From 2013 through 2017, China
was the world's fourth-largest arms supplier, completing more than \$25

also [are]{.mark} a [component of China's foreign policy]{.mark}, used
in conjunction with other types of military, economic aid, and
development assistance [to **support broader foreign policy
goals**]{.mark}]{.underline}," the Pentagon report said. "These include
securing access to natural resources and export markets, [[promoting
political influence among host country elites]{.underline}, [and
building support]{.underline}]{.mark} [in international
forums]{.underline}." Needless to say, [the United States and other
countries have long done the same thing, using arms exports as an
instrument of foreign policy and political influence]{.underline}. Up to
a point, [[however]{.underline}, [US arms sales are regulated by laws
that include human rights and other considerations]{.underline}]{.mark}.
See U.S. Arms Sales and Human Rights: Legislative Basis and Frequently
Asked Questions, CRS In Focus, May 2, 2019. To assist soldiers in
identifying Chinese weapons in the field, the US Army has produced a

#### China is making investments with their weapons, increasing their threat

**Reuters 16**, February 21 2016, "Chinese Weapons Exports Increase Over
the Past Five Years",
https://fortune.com/2016/02/21/chinese-weapons-exports/

[[China]{.mark} has almost [doubled its weapons exports]{.mark} in the
past five years]{.underline}, a military think tank said on Monday, [as
the world's third-largest weapons exporter pours capital into developing
an advanced arms manufacturing industry]{.underline}. In 2011 to 2015,
China's arms imports fell 25% compared with the previous five year
period, signaling a growing confidence in the country's homegrown
weaponry despite key areas of weakness, the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said in a report on global arms
transfers. Chinese exports of major arms, which excludes most light
weaponry, grew by 88% in 2011-2015 compared to the earlier five-year
timeframe, SIPRI said. The country still accounted for only 5.9% of
global arms exports from 2011-2015, well beind the United States and
Russia, by far the world's two largest arms exporters. "[The
[Chinese]{.mark} until ten years ago were only able to offer low tech
equipment]{.underline}. That has changed," said Siemon Wezeman, Senior
Researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme. "[The
[equipment]{.mark} that they produce [is]{.mark} much [more highly
advanced than ten years ago, and attracts interest from]{.mark} some of
the [bigger markets]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[China]{.mark} [has invested
billions developing its]{.mark} homegrown [weapons industry to support
its growing maritime ambitions in the South China Sea and the Indian
Ocean, and also with an eye toward foreign markets for its comparatively
low cost technology]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its total military budget in
2015 was 886.9 billion yuan (\$141.45 billion), up 10 percent from a
year earlier. The U.S. and Russia saw weapons exports grow by 27% and
28% respectively, while exports of major arms by France and Germany, the
fourth and fifth largest weapons exporters, fell over the same period.
Most of China's arms sales went to countries in Asia and Oceania, the
report found, with Pakistan accounting for 35%, followed by Bangladesh
and Myanmar. Pakistan is a key Chinese ally, and close military ties
between the two countries has sometimes stoked tensions with neighboring
India, which is seeking to boost its own homegrown weapons industry.
China still needs to import weapons including large transport aircraft,
helicopters as well as engines for aircraft, vehicles and ships,
according to the report. China, the world's second largest economy,
signed deals in 2015 to buy air defense systems and two dozen combat
jets from Russia, its largest arms supplier.

### UQ: US dominance now (generic)

#### US dominance now

Jason **Lemon**, 12-10-**2018**. U.S. arms sales are nearly six times
higher than those of Russia, Washington\'s closest competitor. Newsweek.
https://www.newsweek.com/us-arms-sales-nearly-six-times-higher-closest-competitor-russia-1252079
/jh

[The United States continues to dominate the international arms
trade,]{.underline} dwarfing its nearest competitor, Russia, by \$184.9
billion.

In 2017, Russian weapons manufacturers sold about \$37.7 billion worth
of arms, compared to \$222.6 billion in sales by American producers,
according to an annual report by the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI) released Monday. [The amount of weapons sales
from U.S. companies is just shy of six times higher than those of
Russia.]{.underline}

But sales from Russia rose 8.5 percent more than those of the U.S.,
which reached 2 percent. The United Kingdom also formerly held the
number-two spot for weapons sales, but Russia has now taken second place
in the global ranking. Overall, Russian sales accounted for 9.5 percent
of the total from the world\'s top 100 producers, and the U.S. sales
accounted for a massive 57 percent.

Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher with SIPRI\'s Arms and Military
Expenditure Program, explained to Radio Free Europe that Russian
companies \"have experienced significant growth in their arms sales
since 2011.

\"This is in line with Russia\'s increased spending on arms procurement
to modernize its armed forces,\" Wezeman added.

[Arms sales were just shy of \$400 billion last year globally, meaning
that the U.S. accounted for well over half of the total from the
world\'s top producing countries]{.underline}. However, the report did
not include data from China, because researchers considered the
information unreliable. A previous report by SIPRI suggested that while
China\'s weapons sales had increased, they only accounted for about 5.7
percent of the world\'s arms exports between 2013 and 2017.

#### Despite growing industrial capacity and high interest, Chinese exports are confined to Asia

Away,\" Defense Security Monitor,
https://dsm.forecastinternational.com/wordpress/2019/05/09/chinas-arms-exports-up-up-and-away/

[[Beijing continues to build]{.mark} its [stature as a global arms
exporter]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to the Pentagon's annual report
to Congress on the military and security developments of the People's
Republic of China (PRC). Per Department of Defense research, [China
completed over \$25 billion worth of arms sales between 2013 and
2017,]{.underline} thereby rising to the level of world's fourth-largest
arms supplier. This largely mirrors an earlier report released by the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in March which
noted that China ranked among the world's top-five largest exporters of
defense-related hardware, behind the U.S., Russia, France and Germany,
[[with 5]{.mark}.7 [percent]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the global
[total]{.mark}]{.underline} from 2013 to 2017. [The rise of China's
defense budget]{.underline}, [aided by [decades of strong economic
growth]{.mark}, [has fed]{.mark} the development of [military industrial
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, in turn, has
[elevated the profile of China as a regional and global arms
supplier.]{.underline} For most of its history, the PRC has been a net
importer of military materiel, relying on the former Soviet Union to
help it develop its own military-industrial complex in its early years.
As its defense industrial sector has matured, China has placed a premium
on domestic innovation and production. Over time this has allowed the
country to reduce its dependency on arms imports, the array of which
remain limited due to bans enacted following the communist regime
crackdown on Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protesters in 1989. Whereas
China was once an importer of entire military systems, today it
primarily imports components -- particularly engines sourced from Russia
-- to equip domestically designed and produced platforms.
[[Manufacturers such as]{.mark} Aviation Industry Corporation of China
([AVIC),]{.mark} China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation
([CASIC]{.mark}), China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC),
[and]{.mark} China North Industries Corporation ([NORINCO]{.mark}) [are
growing into significant global players]{.mark} in the international
arms market, aiding China's rise to top]{.underline}-five global
[exporter]{.underline}. That China should reach this level of global
success may seem inevitable from a 21st century lens, but during the
embryonic stage of its military-industrial development in the 1950s,
such a leap would not have appeared foreordained. At that time, Chinese
weapons exports were largely driven by ideological concerns. China
delivered low-tech, largely obsolete weaponry to strategically aligned
communist regimes and communist-inspired "national liberation" movements
in the developing world. Because China's defense-industrial base was
still primitive and reliant upon Soviet technological assistance and
weapons deliveries, communist China mainly acted as an intermediary for
the Soviets in theaters of war such as Vietnam. By the late 1960s, China
had forged a close strategic alliance with Pakistan, with massive
Chinese arms sales and deliveries to Islamabad providing a crucial
cornerstone for burgeoning Sino-Pakistani ties. Through these weapons
exports, China was able to cultivate a crucial regional relationship
that continues to this day (and Pakistan remains China's largest weapons
export market). The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) provided Beijing with yet
another opening into new markets. With both sides requiring fresh
influxes of weapons and ammunition, China's no-strings-attached export
policy suited both combatants as they increasingly found themselves
marginalized on the international market. The war marked the rise of
China as a large weapons supplier on the global market and secured Iran
as a lucrative, long-term export market for Chinese defense products.
Today [[China's primary]{.mark} export [market remains Asia]{.mark}
(including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, among others), but it has
successfully]{.underline} and [steadily penetrated parts of the
developing world]{.underline}, including Africa, Latin America, and the
Middle East.

[[Decades of economic growth coupled with its ongoing military
modernization have enabled China to emerge as a major player in the
global arms trade]{.underline}]{.mark}. For years, Beijing imported
several times more conventional weapons than it sold overseas, but since
2013 the value of Chinese arms exports has surpassed that of its foreign
acquisitions. Between 2008 and 2017, China exported some \$14.4 billion
worth of conventional weapons across the globe, making it the [[5th
largest arms supplier in the world -- behind the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}, Russia, France, and Germany. Most of
Beijing's arms exports are sold to countries close to home. Despite low
levels of arms exports throughout the mid-1990s and into the mid-2000s,
most of what China did export (82.8 percent) were shipped to countries
across Asia. This trend has continued as China has emerged as a leader
in the global arms trade. A combined 62.4 percent of China's
conventional weapons sales since 2008 have found their way to Pakistan,
Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Other Asian countries have purchased an
additional 11.8 percent of Chinese arms. Over the past decade, Chinese
arms sales across South and Southeast Asia grew from \$386 million in
2008 to \$1.5 billion in 2016 before falling to \$948 million in 2017.
Notwithstanding this growth, China lags other traditional arms exporters
to the region. Since 2008, the US has exported \$27.2 billion worth of
conventional weapons across Asia (not including the Middle East).2 Close
military ties have paved the way for China to supply Pakistan with more
arms than any other country. These exchanges are often tied to political
objectives. Due in large part to growing cooperation between Beijing and
Islamabad on counter-terrorism initiatives, sales surged from \$250
million in 2008 to over \$750 million in 2009. In March 2018, Beijing
announced the sale of sophisticated optical tracking systems that could
be used for nuclear missiles with multiple warheads. This announcement
came just weeks after India successfully tested the Agni-V long-range
ballistic missile in mid-January. Other purchases highlight close levels
of collaboration between China and Pakistan, such as the co-developed
JF-17 aircraft. Bangladesh is also a strong buyer of Chinese weapons.
Between 2008 and 2017, China provided \$1.86 billion of weapons to
Bangladesh. This constitutes 71.9 percent of Bangladesh's military
acquisitions over this period, making China far and away the biggest
supplier of arms to Dhaka. [[China supports these procurements by
offering generous loans and providing its wares at competitive
prices]{.mark}.]{.underline} Discounted acquisitions include the 2013
transfer of two used Type-035G Ming-class submarines for Bangladesh for
just over \$100 million each. Since 2006, China has also supplied
Bangladesh with the majority of its small arms, totaling over 16,000
rifles and 4,100 pistols. Myanmar is the third largest market for
Chinese arms exports in Asia. Since the easing of sanctions against
Myanmar in the early 2010s, it has ramped up its acquisition of foreign
arms. This buying spree has enabled China to make considerable inroads.
Over the last six years, Myanmar has imported \$954 million in
conventional weapons from China. Higher ticket items include 17 JF-17
aircraft, 12 Chinese Rainbow UAVs, 2 Type-43 Frigates, and 76 Type-92
armored vehicles. For most of the 1980s and 1990s, weapons sales to
Africa represented less than 15 percent of its total arms exports. As
China has worked to expand its foothold in the region, this number has
grown. Since 2008, countries in Africa collectively purchased around 21
percent (\$3 billion since 2008) of China's overall arms exports.
Northern African countries are the primary destination of Chinese
weapons, constituting 42 percent of Chinese exports to the continent. An
additional 29 percent flows into to Eastern Africa, and the remaining 29
percent are divided between other African states. This relatively wide
market distribution is somewhat unusual for major arms traders. Of the
\$4.9 billion of US arms exported to Africa over the last decade,
roughly 87 percent were purchased by Egypt and Morocco. Similarly,
Algeria and Egypt accounted for 84 percent of Russian arms transfers in
Africa over the same period. In terms of trade value, Russia leads the
pack at \$12.4 billion in sales since 2008. The US tallied less than
half of that at \$4.9 billion, while China sold around \$3 billion. That
said, Chinese weaponry is becoming increasingly attractive due in part
to its cost-effectiveness. Although Chinese arms are often less advanced
than those sold by other countries, the DOD notes that ["[Chinese arms
are less expensive than those offered by the top international arms
suppliers... \[but still\] have advanced
capabilities."]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, the low-cost K-8 jet
trainer is estimated to make up 80 percent of all jet trainer aircraft
in Africa. [[China is actively working to strengthen its foothold in
certain markets]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as Algeria. China's exports
to the North African country totaled \$483 million between 2008 and
2014, but jumped to \$247 million in 2015 alone and peaked at \$499
million in 2016 as several weapon orders were fulfilled. These
procurements included three C-28A frigates, which were ordered by
Algeria in 2012. Although not a member of the Missile Technology Control
Regime, a non-proliferation agreement targeted at missiles and systems
capable of delivery weapons of mass destruction, Beijing is generally
compliant with international protocols. The 2002 Regulations on the
Export Control of Missiles and Missile-related Items and Technologies,
for instance, outlines measures to safeguard against proliferation. In
June 2017, China published a draft of the Export Control Law, which if
enacted will update existing legislation and establish a comprehensive
export control regime. [[Beijing has been quick to adapt its domestic
regulations to account for emerging technology. This has enabled it to
fill the void left by other suppliers. The US, which has long been at
the forefront of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) development, has
purposely restricted the export of its UAVs. Regulations that until
recently characterized long-range unmanned aerial systems as cruise
missiles, have also limited overseas access of American UAVs. These
factors have created a ripe market opportunity for China, which has made
its UAVs available to countries such as Nigeria and
Egypt]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is worth noting that Chinese weapons have
found their way into various conflict zones. Reports indicate that
Chinese arms have been used during conflicts in the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan, and Somalia. In July 2014, China North
Industries Corporation delivered 100 guided missile systems, over 9,000
automatic rifles, and 24 million rounds of ammunition to the South
Sudanese government, whose actions have been widely criticized by the
international community. Over the past decade, Chinese arm sales to the
Americas have grown modestly. In 2008, China exported a meager \$41
million to countries in the Western Hemisphere. This number plateaued at
\$178 million in 2015 before dropping to \$36 million in 2016. Beijing
did not sell any weapons to the region in 2017. Chinese conventional
weapons make up just 3 percent of the combined North and South American
arms import market, which is dominated by the United States (19
percent), Russia (14 percent), and Germany (12 percent). Chinese arms
exports in the Americas are concentrated in Venezuela, which attracted
87.4 percent of Beijing's regional weapons sales over the last decade.
Chinese weapon transfers to Venezuela did not begin in earnest until
after 2006 when the United States placed an arms embargo against
Venezuela for failing to cooperate in US-led anti-terrorism efforts.
Since then Caracas has found a ready partner as it has sought to upgrade
its military in a cost-effective manner. Notable transactions include
the sale of 18 K-8 trainer jets in 2010, 121 VN-4 armored vehicles in
2012, and an undisclosed number of C-802 anti-ship missiles in 2017.
China is now Venezuela's number two supplier of conventional weapons at
12 percent of the market share; a position well behind Russia's dominant
role as the supplier for 74 percent of Caracas' arms imports. While
China's major conventional weapons sales in the region are limited,
China is a provider of small arms to North America. Prior to 2009, most
of these procurements flowed into Canada, but in recent years Mexico has
become a more significant market. All told, however, China only supplies
a fraction of both country's foreign small arms acquisitions. According
to some reports, Chinese weapons are increasingly finding their way into
the hands of Mexican cartels.

### Link: Drones

3\. Existing export restrictions gave China a strategic advantage. [[By
dominating the armed drone export market]{.underline}]{.mark} thus far,
[[China has built defense relationships with countries around the
world]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[including U.S. allies]{.mark} and
partners]{.underline}. [The [Obama]{.mark} administration [denied
requests]{.mark} for armed or advanced unarmed drones]{.underline} from
Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. [[Subsequently, these
countries bought armed drones from China]{.underline}]{.mark}. Saudi
Arabia has also purchased armed drones from China. The Trump
administration thus might have thought that **[[a restrictive drone
export policy was ceding influence to China]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
something of concern, given that Trump's national security strategy
characterized China as a "competitor" and a "revisionist" power, and
Trump himself labeled China a "rival" in his State of the Union address.

**Chinese drones are less effective and less efficient. People only buy
Chinese drones in the absence of U.S. sales.**

[**[Why the Gulf is buying Chinese drones in the first place]{.mark}
Simply put, [China's weaponized drones are on the market when others
aren't.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The UAE has had Chinese Wing Loong I
drones since 2016, and started receiving its purchases of the upgraded
and deadlier Wing Loong II in early 2018. The UAVs, intended for
surveillance and reconnaissance, can carry a range of weapons including
missiles and laser-guided bombs to blow up targets on land or in the
air. The Saudis have bought China's CH-4 and the Wing Loong II, and both
countries have deployed their drones in Yemen. [Last summer, Riyadh
confirmed that the Chinese were building a CH-4 production facility ---
the first drone factory in the region --- in Saudi Arabia. The CH-4, an
ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and attack drone
with similarities to the Reaper, is also used by the UAE, Iraq and
Egypt**. In addition to being able to sell to any willing buyer, the
Chinese also offer the lowest prices on the market.** According to Jack
Watling, a land warfare expert at the Royal United Services Institute
(RUSI) in London, the UAE's **[Chinese drone purchases began after the
the U.S. refused to sell]{.mark} them [American armed
UAVs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Now, he says, "the (President Donald) Trump
administration has reduced its threshold for sale, which partly happened
after the UAE started its Chinese drone purchases." Gulf militaries do
have American drones, but not ones capable of destroying targets. These
include the U.S.-made Predator XP, which can carry ISR camera packages,
but it's downgraded so that it can't carry weapons systems.
[**[Still]{.mark}, Watling says, [U.S platforms are better than their
Chinese counterparts --- and if given the opportunity, buyers would
likely choose those.]{.mark} "[Chinese UAS]{.mark} (unmanned aerial
systems) [are not as stable as American systems]{.mark},**" he
explained. "They therefore have to fly lower, though they are improving.
**[This has resulted in several Chinese platforms being shot
down."]{.mark}**]{.underline} 'Definitely a threat' ["The Chinese are
definitely a threat," Gerard Robottom, international market area
director at California-based UAV manufacturer AeroVironment, told CNBC
at the conference. But he stressed that **[reliability is key]{.mark}**,
adding**, "you can find [a lot of]{.mark} our [customers]{.mark} out
here, and they'll [tell you the importance of a good ISR from a
reputable compan]{.mark}y." Robottom's colleagues attested to the
lengthy U.S. government process for approving even non-lethal drone
exports, which they described as a hindrance to international
business.**]{.underline}

[[When the United States has held back from transferring drones abroad,

drone to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. [[Many of China's sales have
been armed]{.underline}]{.mark}. (The MTCR does not distinguish between
armed vs. unarmed drones.) China has sold armed drones to Egypt, Iraq,
Jordan, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,
Turkmenistan, and the United Arab Emirates.44 [In fact, every
international transfer of an armed drone to date with the exception of
the U.S. transfer to the United Kingdom has been from
China.]{.underline} Over time, this is likely to change as the United
States and Israel transfer more armed drones abroad as well. In addition
to the pending U.S. transfer to Italy, Israel reportedly has approved
but not yet delivered transfers of armed drones to Germany and India.45

#### Chinese drones are replacing US drones -- leads to worse human rights abuses

Jakob **Reimann 19**, 2-18-2019, \"China is Flooding the Middle East
With Cheap Drones,\" Foreign Policy In Focus,
<https://fpif.org/china-is-flooding-the-middle-east-with-cheap-drones/>

The last great revolution on the world's battlefields began with the
advent of the drone era. Particularly in the Middle East, the drone
became the symbol of the U.S. empire operating in a legal vacuum. [In
the first decade and a half of the "War on Terror," the U.S. still had a
virtual monopoly]{.underline} on the risk-free execution [from thousands
of meters above]{.underline} --- but once the genie is out of the
bottle, every attempt to squeeze it back in is notoriously doomed to
failure. And [so, quickly other countries in the region aspired after
the financially]{.underline} --- [and politically --- cheap execution by
drone]{.underline}. **[[The number of armies with their own drone fleet
is growing rapidly. [A multi-billion-dollar
market](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2017/05/03/global-drone-market-expected-to-surpass-22b-by-2022/)
with astronomical growth rates opened up --- demand that's essentially
served only by one actor: China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The
appearance of the Rainbow CH-4 --- the driving force of Chinese combat
drones --- is [almost
identical](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a22101/chinas-ch-4b-drone-looks-awfully-familiar/)
to the notorious Reaper drone of the U.S. arms manufacturer General
Atomics.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While the CH-4 [lags
behind](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/)
the Reaper in most performance parameters, **[it can keep up with or
even outperform its competitor]{.underline}** in some of them. Also,
[**[the CH-4's weaponry, [the AKD-10
warhead](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/),
is almost identical to the Reaper's Hellfire
missiles]{.underline}**.]{.mark} The striking similarity follows a
strategy of Chinese engineering well-known from cell phones or cars: the
look of a world-famous Western branded product is copied with an
inferior but sufficiently good quality compared to that of the original
--- but at significantly less cost. **[[Chinese drones are 50 to 75
percent cheaper than the originals]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the U.S.
A late 2015 article published in the Asia Times suggests that this
copying of U.S. technology is likely rooted in Beijing's data theft.
According to records by world-famous NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden,
by 2010 alone "Chinese hackers had conducted [more than 30,000 cyber
attacks](http://www.atimes.com/chinas-armed-drones-appear-built-from-stolen-data-from-us-cyber-intrusions/)"
on Pentagon computer networks and other U.S. military agencies in order
to "exfiltrate \[data on\] sensitive military technology." Although
there is no final proof that data on drones were skimmed off too, Asia
Times quotes then NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander, who suggests that
it is highly likely that the Reaper blueprints were part of the Chinese
data hack, while military experts and analysts largely share this view.
With the latest model --- the CH-7, which is still in the development
phase --- [China could possibly pull ahead the U.S.]{.underline} for the
first time, military journal [Defense One
explains](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/11/chinas-beating-us-market-combat-drones-copying-us-technology/152625/).
The CH-7 "will be the sole option for buyers wanting to field stealth
combat drones," it predicts. "[The United States had a decade-plus head
start on \[drone\] technology]{.underline}," says military expert Paul
Scharre, "[and has unfortunately squandered that lead]{.underline}." For
a long time, it was only the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Israel that had combat drones and used them to execute alleged
terrorists --- something that has changed dramatically in recent years.
Meanwhile, the number of countries with combat drones has swelled to [at
least
29](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/world-of-drones/3-who-has-what-countries-armed-drones/),
as research organization New America identifies. And 10
[countries](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/world-of-drones/2-who-has-what-countries-drones-used-combat/)
have demonstrably used them to kill suspected enemies; in addition to
the three mentioned, there is Iran, Azerbaijan, the UAE, as well as
Nigeria, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey (the last four countries
drone-killed people on their own soil). Historically, [Israel is the
largest drone exporter, with a [market share of over 60
percent](https://drones.rusi.org/countries/israel/) in the last three
decades]{.underline}. More recently, from 2008-2017, China exported a
total of [88 drones to at least 12
countries](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/),
ranking third among the world's drone exporters behind the United States
(351) and Israel (186). However, while the vast majority of U.S. and
Israeli exports are made up of unarmed reconnaissance drones, [China's
sales focus on armed drones]{.underline}. During the mentioned period,
China exported 68 combat drones, [putting it ahead of the
U.S.]{.underline} (62) [and Israel]{.underline} (56). Foreign Policy
thus recently titled rightly: "[China Has Already Won the Drone
Wars](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/)."
All of the armed forces of the Chinese military have [large fleets of
various
drones](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2161354/drones-have-become-part-chinas-military-strategy),
but Beijing has used them so far only for disaster relief, surveillance
of domestic critics, and military reconnaissance --- not to kill. (In
2013, Beijing considered executing by drone a [Myanmar drug
baron](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/world/asia/chinese-plan-to-use-drone-highlights-military-advances.html)
wanted in the murders of 13 Chinese sailors, but eventually caught and
tried him.) Rather, Beijing appears to be establishing a norm
permanently prohibiting lethal drone strikes in East and South Asia.
However, this no-shoot dogma does not prevent the Chinese arms industry
from exporting their drones to states that are patently using them for
killing elsewhere. While the Pentagon continues to this day to deliver
armed Reaper drones only to the UK, France, and Italy, purchasers of
Chinese combat drones, [according to Chinese
manufacturers](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/),
include Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, the UAE, and Zambia. So far, [the
three largest buyers of Chinese
drones](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/)
are Pakistan (with a share of 25 percent) as well as Egypt and Myanmar
(with 23 and 13 percent, respectively). [Several of Beijing's buyers are
close strategic U.S. allies who have requested the sale of armed drones
from Washington to no avail and have thus fallen back on Chinese
products]{.underline}. The U.S. is by far the largest arms exporter and
usually sells military equipment to almost every country in the world.
[According to the SIPRI research
institute](http://justicenow.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SIPRI_Arms-Export-USA_2007-2017.xlsx),
the U.S. sold \$98 billion worth of weapons to as many as 112 countries
in 2007-2017. Hence, on the face of it, it seems rather counterintuitive
that it would hand over the lucrative battle drone market to China. [A
recent report by the
DIA](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/pentagon-mideast-turning-china-drone-needs.html),
the Pentagon's internal intelligence service, deals with this
contradiction. "[China is a niche provider of armed \[drones\]" in the
Middle East]{.underline}, the report acknowledges, and correctly
concludes that "[China faces little competition]{.underline}" [as it is
not a member of international export control regimes]{.underline}. In
fact, unlike the U.S. and the European arms-exporting countries, China
is not a contracting party to the [Missile Technology Control
Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Technology_Control_Regime#Members)
(MTRC), which strictly regulates the proliferation of combat drones and
makes U.S. drone exports to the Middle East more difficult. In addition
to attempts by the Trump administration to amend the MTRC, Trump's State
Department published a [new export
policy](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280619.htm) in April
2018: "We will remove barriers to the global \[drone\] market and avoid
ceding export opportunities to competitors where such self-imposed
restrictions are unwarranted." Since the wording does not specify when
restrictions are "unwarranted," the new policy can be understood as
blank approval for future drone exports. De facto, it was also made
possible to buy combat drones directly from the manufacturer, [without
the government as a broker
agent](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/06/trump-push-to-boost-lethal-drone-exports-reaps-few-rewards-uas-mtcr/).
"To date, however, that hasn't led to any reported sales to the Middle
East," Forbes
[reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/17/china-fueling-drones-arms-race-middle-east/)
late last year. So, in contrast to relatively strict regulations on U.S.
drone exports, China's "[no questions
asked](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/17/china-fueling-drones-arms-race-middle-east/)"
policy allowed it to quickly gain a foothold in the lucrative Middle
East drone market and aggressively expand the course of the
proliferation of cheap drones. State-of-the-art technology perceived as
revolutionary always comes with a certain adulation for its possessor.
Thus, a recent report by London-based military think tank RUSI concludes
that "[national prestige and
status](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/drones-1687746893) is the
main reason that most states" in the Middle East increasingly acquire
drones, as Middle East Eye reports. However, in addition to their value
as status symbols, in recent years they are more and more being used
strategically [on the battlefields of the
region](https://www.voanews.com/a/report-china-driving-use-of-armed-drones-in-middle-east/4704022.html),
which the RUSI report attributes largely to increased Chinese exports.
And so Chinese drones also recorded their first deaths: Besides fatal
deployment by the [Nigerian
army](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/10/03/chinese-armed-drones-now-flying-over-mideast-battlefields-heres-why-theyre-gaining-on-us-drones/)against
Boko Haram, since the end of 2015, the Iraqi military performed more
than [260 air
strikes](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinas-drones-are-taking-isis-heres-why-america-should-worry-24581)against
Islamic State targets with Chinese drones. They gained particular infamy
on April 22 last year, when the UAE [executed the de facto president of

four-year war in the country. The murdered Al-Sammad was seen as a
promoter of the UN-mediated peace process in Yemen, whereas his
successor, Mahdi al-Mashat, is an implacable, uncompromising hardliner
and provocateur. **[Of particular concern is China's drone policy in

civilians in all these undeclared war zones to a permanent threat on
their lives. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Barack Obama proved he could
always escape punishment and international condemnation even after using
drones to [turn weddings and funerals into blood baths and mass
graves](https://roarmag.org/essays/obama-legacy-war-conflict-peace/).
And so, the desires of local actors to acquire these practical killing
tools were aroused, too. **[The Chinese leadership is exploiting these
developments without compromise and flooding the Middle East with cheap
drones. The consequences of this expansionary policy cannot be
foreseen.]{.underline}**

(CSIC) on Wednesday announced it had set up a representative office in
Dubai to expand sales across the Gulf region. The company, which
developed and built China's first home-grown aircraft carrier, said the
office was its first overseas and would focus on pursuing both military
and civilian business opportunities. [[**One of the world's biggest arms
markets, the Middle East accounted for 32 per cent of global weapons

said. [Meanwhile, **China's arms exports to the Middle East jumped 38

[and it is now the fifth-largest arms exporter in the world, supplying
weapons to 48 countries. **Pakistan is the main buyer of Chinese
weapons, but Middle Eastern nations are also looking to China.**]{.mark}
Since 2014, China has sold more than 30 CH-4 drones to countries such as
Saudi Arabia, though its arms exports to the kingdom in 2017 totalled
about US\$20 million -- compared to US\$3.4 billion from the United
States.]{.underline} China has also sold its Wing Loong II drone to the
United Arab Emirates, and Qatar has bought its ballistic missiles. In
addition to setting up a branch in Dubai, CSIC also had its unmanned
20-tonne Aegis-class destroyer on display at the International Defence
Exhibition and Conference in Abu Dhabi, which wrapped up on Thursday.
Dubbed the "mini Aegis" because it has an electronic system said to be
as advanced as America's Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the JARI USV is
a 15-metre vessel with a top speed of 42 knots and a range of 500
nautical miles. Developed by CSIC's 716 Research Institute, it can be
armed with a 30mm cannon combined with small surface-to-air missiles,
anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and lightweight anti-submarine
torpedoes. It can also track underwater targets 7km away. Beijing-based
military analyst Zhou Chenming said the Chinese navy did not need the
mini Aegis and CSIC was building the vessel -- which could be used for
the Gulf region's narrow waterway -- for overseas markets. ["This
reflects the fact that China's defence technology is advancing ... that
it can assemble a product based on the specific needs of customers," he
said. "China is improving its radar technology and can make smaller
active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar for the
vessel."]{.underline} Also on show in Abu Dhabi was China North
Industries Group's new VT4 heavy infantry fighting vehicle -- a
third-generation main battle tank made for export. Other Chinese weapons
on display included the MRTV 3000 frigate and C-602 medium-range cruise
missiles. [**[China's increased arms sales to the Middle East]{.mark}**
have triggered concern from nations such as Israel and the US. Israel is
worried about its exports to Iran, while the US has raised concerns
about **[China's growing influence in the region through the weapons
trade and its projects under the "Belt and Road

Institute said China was a significant supplier of military drones to
Middle East countries, especially those that are barred from importing
them from the US.

#### China's making inroads to SALW exports in Africa now -- the plan solidifies their control

Africa",

UNITED NATIONS --- [[China's arms exports have surged]{.mark} over the
past decade, flooding sub-Saharan [Africa with]{.mark} a new source of
cheap [assault rifles]{.mark} international scrutiny as its lethal wares
wind up in conflict zones in violation of U.N. sanctions]{.underline}.
Weapons from China have surfaced in a string of U.N. investigations in
war zones stretching from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Ivory
Coast, Somalia and Sudan. China is by no means alone in supplying the
arms that help fuel African conflicts, and there is no proof that China
or its arms exporters have intentionally violated U.N. embargoes in any
of those countries. But China has stood apart from other major arms
exporters, including Russia, for its assertive challenge to U.N.
authority, routinely refusing to cooperate with U.N. arms experts and
flexing its diplomatic muscle to protect its allies and curtail
investigations that may shed light on its own secretive arms industry.
[The stance highlights the [tensions between China's responsibilities as
a]{.mark} global [power and]{.mark} its [interests in]{.mark} exploiting
[new markets]{.mark}. It [has]{.mark} also [raised questions
about]{.mark} whether [Chinese]{.mark} diplomats have a [grip on]{.mark}
the [reach of]{.mark} the country's [influence in]{.mark} the [arms
industry beyond its borders]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beijing has responded
to the disclosures not by enforcing regulations at home but by using its
clout within the Security Council to claw back the powers of independent
U.N. arms investigators. Those efforts have helped undercut the
independence of U.N. panels that track arms trading with Iran and North
Korea. "This is really a case of unbridled capitalism, and I think the
Chinese government is not even always aware of what these companies are
doing," said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and
International Security, which has been tracking Iran's and North Korea's
procurement of nuclear technology from Chinese companies. When the
Chinese are "confronted with evidence," Albright said, "they respond
very defensively and legalistically." [China has blocked the release of
embarrassing U.N. revelations of illicit arms transfers, stopped the
reappointment of an arms expert who uncovered Chinese weapons and sought
to restrict the budget to fund investigations. It has also consistently
refused to allow U.N. investigators to trace the origin of Chinese
weapons discovered in war zones]{.underline}. The country's mission to
the United Nations did not respond to repeated requests for comment for
this report, but its representatives have repeatedly denied accusations
that the country is violating sanctions. More broadly, China has made
clear that it has a philosophical aversion to sanctions, which were
imposed on Beijing by the European Union following the Tiananmen Square
events in 1989, and that it believes most major political disputes are
better addressed through diplomatic talks[. Council diplomats say China
has gone along with the proliferation of U.N. sanctions panels in order
to maintain a cooperative relationship with the West, particularly the
United States]{.underline}. Today, the United Nations enforces arms
embargoes against 13 countries or groups, including the Taliban,
al-Qaeda and seven African countries. [But China's willingness to play
along has been tested over the past decade as it has transformed itself
from the world's largest importer of arms to a major
producer]{.underline}, with domestic production exploding by 95 percent
from 2002 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2011, making it the sixth-largest
arms exporter in the world. [The trend has been most sharply felt in
sub-Saharan Africa, where China, a major presence at arms trade shows in
Africa]{.underline}, sells weapons to 16 countries, more than any other
top arms trader from outside the region. According to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, it now accounts for 25 percent
of the market, not including South Africa. (SIPRI notes that a number of
large Ukrainian and Russian arms sales to Sudan and Uganda are likely to
force China out of the top ranking in 2012.) "[**[Africa is]{.mark}
quite [an important market for]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} arms
[industry because it is a stepping stone]{.mark}**[" to be]{.mark}coming
a [first-tier arms exporter]{.mark}]{.underline}, said Pieter D.
Wezeman, the chief author of the SIPRI report, noting that China's
offerings are far too inferior to compete in the industrialized arms
market. "They have to start somewhere," he said. Some of those arms have
been diverted to conflict zones under U.N. sanctions. In May 2011, a
team of U.N. arms experts collected several high-explosive incendiary
cartridges in the Darfur town of Tukumare, where Sudanese armed forces
had recently battled rebels, according to a confidential report that was
produced by three U.N. arms experts and first publicly disclosed by the
London-based newsletter Africa Confidential. The cartridges --- which
were manufactured in China in 2010, more than five years after the arms
embargo first went into effect --- were compatible with weapons systems
used in Sudan's Russian-made Mi-24 attack helicopters and Su-25 ground
attack aircraft. [[But]{.mark} [China]{.mark} rebuffed requests by a
U.N. panel to attempt to trace the cartridges back to their
manufacturer. It was not the first time]{.underline}. A review of
Chinese compliance compiled by SIPRI showed that [China has
[routinely]{.mark} [provide]{.mark}d panel members with [incomplete
answers when confronted]{.mark} [with evidence of Chinese
arms]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory
Coast, Sudan and Somalia, where China declined a request from a U.N.
panel that discovered 15 Chinese RPGs in the hands of Somali pirates. It
is in the case of Darfur, where Chinese ammunition has become a feature
of annual U.N. reports, [China has moved most aggressively to clamp down
on a panel's findings]{.underline}. In 2011, China blocked the release
of the Darfur panel's report, then singled out the arms expert, Holger
Anders of Germany, who had uncovered boxes of Chinese cartridges, and
dismissed his work as unprofessional. "An undergraduate student could
have done better work; nothing was verified; it was nothing more than
hearsay," China's delegation told the panel, according to an account
provided by an official familiar with the matter. Anders responded by
presenting the Chinese with an envelope filled with cartridges and
asking them to analyze them themselves, according to the official, who
declined to speak for the record because of the sensitivity of the
issue. The Chinese diplomats took the shells, but never responded. In
January 2011, China placed a hold on the U.N. decision to renew Anders's
contract, effectively shutting him out of the Security Council panels.
Anders has since gone to work for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Ivory
Coast. U.S. and European officials have sought to persuade China to take
a more conciliatory approach in Darfur, saying that China was needlessly
drawing attention to itself even though other countries such as Russia,
Belarus and Ukraine were supplying Sudan with deadlier and more advanced
weapons, including attack helicopters. Council diplomats said that while
Chinese diplomats in New York recognize the futility of their response,
they have been hemmed in by hard-liners in Beijing, particularly within
the People's Liberation Army, which oversees China's arms exports.
Council diplomats also say they remain unsure how much control China's
diplomats have over China's arms trade. Last September, the Canadian
newspaper Globe and Mail reported that it had obtained documents showing
that Libyan officials met with Chinese companies to buy arms on July 11,
2011, several months after the council had imposed an arms embargo on
Libya. The Foreign Ministry in China, which had voted in favor of the
Libya sanctions, said the contacts had taken place without the
government's knowledge. They said no arms were delivered, and that they
would strictly implement the Libya sanctions. "The PLA has a very
powerful voice at the table, and on some of the arms issues what we hear
is, this might look like benign munitions in country X but this is going
to set people off in our capital," according to a Security Council
diplomat who has worked closely with the Chinese. "The Chinese get
extremely sensitive." In practice[, China has shown the "minimum amount
of effort" in enforcing arms embargoes it supports at the Security
Council]{.underline}, the official added. "Get them off the record and
they say, 'Look, we have been subjected to sanctions ourselves.' " [The
United States has sought to assuage Chinese sensitivities by granting
Beijing and other key powers greater political control over U.N.
investigators enforcing sanctions]{.underline}. In 2009, for instance,
the Obama administration proposed inviting the Chinese, along with the
council's other permanent members, plus South Korea and Japan, to
appoint their own national experts to enforce sanctions against North
Korea. [[Beijing's diplomats]{.mark} have [worke]{.mark}d assiduously
[to limit]{.mark} the [experts' ability to]{.mark} do their jobs,
pressing for budget cuts that would curb their ability to travel to
[carry out investigations and attend specialist
conferences]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} China has refused numerous
requests by the North Korea panel to visit Beijing to discuss its own
efforts to enforce sanctions, and it blocked the publication of the
panel's annual report in 2011. "It has had a bit of a chilling effect,"
said a council diplomat. "It has made the panels a little gun-shy
because their reports might not see the light of day if they are too
blunt." U.S. and European diplomats said that despite Chinese reticence,
they have been able to leverage U.N. sanctions, particularly in places
like Iran and North Korea, to reinforce U.S. and European sanctions, and
to apply pressure on countries that do business with them. "The fact
that the panels exist has given a jolt to \[Western efforts\] to enforce
these sanctions and that is a positive thing," said the council
diplomat. [Western diplomats say that they have also succeeded in
gradually convincing China to expose itself to greater
scrutiny]{.underline}. This year, China allowed the release of the North
Korea panel's 2012 report, which documented the role of China's Dalian
port as a trans-shipment point for luxury goods entering North Korea in
violation of U.N. sanctions. They also noted the mysterious appearance
of a new KN-08 portable missile launcher on the back of a truck during
parade celebrating the 100th anniversary of Kim Il Sung's birth.
However, they said, the suspected supplier of the missile launcher ---
China --- was excised from the final report.

#### China is increasing their exports in Africa, due to the gaps left by the US

**Tian 18**, Dr. Nan Tian (Researcher with SIPRI Arms Transfers and
Military Expenditure Programme), September 17 2018, "China's Arms Trade:
A Rival for Global Influence?",
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2018/09/17/chinas_arms_trade_a_rival_for_global_influence\_\_113806.html

Against the backdrop of the recent China-Africa Defence and Security
Forum, numerous articles have been written questioning the rationale
behind the conference and the potential ramifications of a closer
Sino-African relationship. [The fall in export of Russian made weapons
to Africa corresponded with the [rise in Chinese
exports]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Prime among those is the [link]{.mark}
between growing Chinese arms exports to the region and [a way of
securing]{.mark} greater [geopolitical influence]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), announced in 2013, is one
significant example where the economic expansion via the land (belt) and
sea (silk road) has challenged the strategic interests of many states.
[Couple this with China's growing arms industry and arms exports, the
question of vital importance is whether weapon sales have become [a new
foreign policy tool for China in Africa]{.mark}. Development of the
Chinese arms industry has enabled it to become a major arms exporter
(number five in the world) in recent years]{.underline}. According to
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, between 2008-2012
and 2013-2017, the 38% increase in total arms exports was second only to
Israel. In this time [[Chinese export to Africa rose]{.mark} by
[55%]{.mark}, and its share of total African arms imports increased from
8.4 to 17%.]{.underline} Although Russia remains the largest supplier of
major weapons to Africa (39% of the region's imports), [[some
see]{.mark} the [rise]{.mark} of Chinese [arms
exports]{.mark}]{.underline} to the region as having a threefold
rationale: [[Beijing's push to become a major arms
producer]{.underline}]{.mark}. Compete against Russia to capture this
growing arms market. [A foreign policy tool to gain regional influence
[for future economic and political interests]{.mark}. Although the total
volume of major arms flow from China to Africa is less than half of
Russia's, it sells to far more African countries than
Russia]{.underline}. Between 2013--17, Russia sold major arms to 14
Africa countries, compared to the [23 of China]{.underline}. This
"blanket" style of selling does not typically fit with the notion of
linking targeted arms sales with foreign policy objectives. The
diversity in the types of weapons and of arms recipients (e.g., from
Algeria to South Africa and Kenya to Cote d\'Ivoire) suggests a more
demand and supply relationship. [As [China continues to develop its
arms]{.mark} industry, any international buyer will help expand its
network, offer important developmental feedback, [and improve weapon
quality and]{.mark} company [profitability]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
fall in export of Russian made weapons to Africa corresponded with the
rise in Chinese exports, potentially due to the availability of more
cost-effective options. This is especially the case in Algeria, where
import of major Chinese arms increased by 46-fold between 2008-2012 and
2013-2017, while the transfer of Russian weapons fell by 35%. Yet
in-depth analysis into Chinese arms exports to Africa shows Algeria as
an outlier that is biasing the recent trends. Of all major weapons
exported from China to Africa between 2013 and 2017, 46% went to
Algeria, prime among them are three heavy corvettes delivered in 2015
and 2016. Remove Algeria and major arms exports to Africa decreased by
12% between 2008-2012 and 2013-2017. Other major African buyers of
Chinese weapons are Morocco and Nigeria. It seems that suggestions
linking China's BRI project, its military base in Djibouti, and
increased military engagement in the related countries are not founded
on arms transfers evidence. The main focus on of Chinese arms exports
remains to its close neighbours. Since 2008, Pakistan (40%) and
Bangladesh (13%) together account for over half of all China's major
weapons exports. Add in Myanmar, [and it's a picture where
[China]{.mark} usually sells [weapon]{.mark}s to countries that the
West]{.underline} (the US and Western Europe) [does not. Such
[sales]{.mark} are partly due to less stringent human rights conditions
[link]{.mark}ed [to]{.mark} arms sales and more affordable weapons, but
also recognising the [gaps left by]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} and thus
securing greater geopolitical influence as part of its foreign
policy.]{.underline} Comparing the types of weapons sold to African and
Asia countries reinforces the argument further. Large ticket items
exported to Bangladesh and Pakistan include frigates, corvettes,
submarines, and air defence systems. [In addition to the transfer of the
weapon, such transactions (sales and military aid) include training,
maintenance, and exchange of information on the capability of the
weapons. All of which enhances country relationships and boosts future
collaborations]{.underline}. In contrast, weapons exports to Africa are
mostly of lower value in the form of armoured personnel carriers (APCs),
light training aircraft, battle tanks and unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs). These are akin to one-time transactions, with limited
commitments to training or maintenance. While the ability to buy
expensive high-tech weapons is lower in African countries compared to
neighbours close to China, [[China has looked to challenge US
influence]{.mark} in Asia [with]{.mark} more [intimate (military and
econ]{.mark}omic[) relations]{.mark}]{.underline} with the likes of
Pakistan and Bangladesh. The same is not evident in Africa. It has been
common knowledge that China has historically linked arms sales to close
neighbours with foreign policy considerations, extending this to African
countries is far less straightforward. Although this does not mean China
has no future ambitions to use arms exports as a foreign policy tool,
evidence from arms exports over the past ten years presents a far less
compelling case in the present. Instead, China's interests in Africa
seem to remain mainly economic (e.g., Forum on China-Africa Cooperation)
focusing on trade (China is Africa's largest trading partner) and
investment deals with arms sale transactions in a demand and supply
basis. However, looking into the future and to [China's growing
geopolitical ambitions, the defence and security forum might become the
launch pad for China to increase its military influence in Africa and a
perfect platform to integrate its economic partnerships with a military
twist]{.underline}.

#### Imposing arms sanctions on Saudi Arabia causes China fill-in

[[China may continue]{.mark} to [engage more with Saudi Arabia if
Washington imposes sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} over the disappearance
and presumed murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but [[it cannot
supplant US arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline} as President Donald Trump
believes, analysts say. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as Washington weighs actions against Riyadh over
the fate of Khashoggi, a US resident and vocal critic of the Saudi
regime who vanished two weeks ago. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump has
been reluctant to support sanctions, citing the impact to a US\$110
billion arms deal he helped broker last year. "I don't like the concept
of stopping an investment of US\$110 billion into the United States
because you know what they're going to do?" Trump told reporters last
week. "They're going to take that money and spend it in Russia or China
or someplace else." [Saudi Arabia has long sought to diversify away from
its reliance on the US and has increasingly stepped up its engagement
with China,]{.underline} its largest trading partner with US\$42.36
billion in bilateral trade in 2017. Last March, the two countries also
signed US\$65 billion worth of deals in areas ranging from energy to
space technology. [[The Arab nation could turn to]{.mark} countries such
as [China]{.mark} and Russia [to help fulfil its military needs if US
sanctions were imposed]{.mark}, a step that would "create an economic
disaster that would rock the entire world",]{.underline} according to a
widely cited opinion piece by the general manager of the Saudi-owned Al
Arabiya news channel. In the editorial, Turki Aldakhil said Saudi Arabia
-- the world's largest oil exporter -- was considering more than 30
countermeasures to be taken against the US, including trading oil in
yuan instead of the US dollar. [[But]{.mark} [in the military]{.mark}
realm, [China's]{.mark} [arms exports to Saudi Arabia lag far
behind]{.mark}]{.underline} those of [[the US and]{.mark} its [European
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Beijing exported only around US\$20
million in arms last year compared to US\$3.4 billion from
Washington]{.underline}, according to data from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, a Swedish think tank. Jonathan
Fulton, assistant professor of political science at Zayed University in
Abu Dhabi, said [[China had grown more serious]{.mark} [in]{.mark} its
regional [arms relationships with Gulf states]{.mark}]{.underline} in
recent years, **[[with the potential to serve as a "wedge" as US-Saudi
relations frayed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Along with Riyadh's previous
indications that it was willing to consider funding in yuan, [[increased
arms sales would be a "natural progression"]{.underline}]{.mark} of
their relationship, he said. "Part of the reason why \[Saudi Arabia\] is
diversifying is there's been so many kinds of structural changes in the
relationship with the US," Fulton said. "Another important part is just
obviously the commercial relationship and economic relationship between
these Gulf states and China, with these energy exports. We're seeing a
lot more engagement both ways." But as evidence piles up that Saudi
Arabia ordered Khashoggi's assassination, which the government denies,
the backlash is getting louder. A bipartisan group of US senators have
pressured Trump to enact sanctions and key corporate sponsors have
pulled out of the high-profile "Davos in the Desert" investment forum to
be held in Riyadh this month. "I would expect to see some kind of ...
Saudi-led way to ease the tensions between the US and Riyadh because I
don't think they can afford to let the US relationship deteriorate,"
Fulton said.

[Over the last several years, China has engaged in aggressive expansion
through economic methods]{.underline}. As a result, **[[the Chinese
government is actively working to supplant the United States as the sole
global superpower]{.underline}]{.mark}**. China's formula is relatively
simple. **[They invest heavily]{.underline}**, through state banks and
controlled corporations, **[in infrastructure and other economic
projects in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Central
America]{.underline}**. [**The investments do not benefit the local
economies**, as the Chinese import their own labor and equipment, as
well as buy Chinese materials]{.underline}. Further, **[[China]{.mark}
[then exploits the country they "invest" in by stripping it of its
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the same time, [[**China uses these
investments to push out other foreign investors in the targeted country,
which makes the nation further dependent on China**.]{.mark} The
investment is made not for the betterment of any country other than
China]{.underline}. Simply put, **[[China's actions are colonization
through economic investment.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In April, I wrote

### CCP Impact: Human Rights

#### CCP perpetuates human rights abuses

Liu **Zhen 19**, 07-12-19, \"China's human rights record, military
aggression hit its soft power,\" South China Morning Post,
<https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2155051/chinas-human-rights-record-aggressive-military>

**[[China's soft power has been weakened by its hard line on foreign
policy and human rights,]{.underline}]{.mark}** according to an annual
survey released on Thursday. [In the "Soft Power 30" report]{.underline}
by communications consultancy Portland and the University of South
California Centre on Public Diplomacy, [China ranked 27th of the 30
countries to make the list]{.underline}, down two places from last year.
**[[The weaker showing was]{.underline}]{.mark}** mostly **[[a result
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** it finishing bottom on
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** "Government" subindex, which measures
**[[nations' political values, such as their position on human rights,
democracy and equality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, said Jonathan McClory,
the report's author and Portland's general manager for Asia.
"**[[China's record in human rights and civil liberties reflects
poorly]{.underline}]{.mark}** among Western audiences," the survey said,
adding that "relatively low scores in competitiveness, ease of doing
business, and rule of law diminish its attractiveness as a global
business hub of choice". Also, while China was boosted in 2017 by
President Xi Jinping's speech at the Davos forum, in which he sought to
position the country as a responsible global leader that supported
globalisation and free trade, as well as the fight against climate
change, that positive narrative "somewhat faded" this year, the report
said. "[International attention concentrated on Xi's decision to
eliminate the two-term limit on the presidency]{.underline}," it said.
**[Beijing's "aggressive military expansion" had also undermined its
efforts to build trust abroad]{.underline}**, by promoting bilateral
relations and through its "Belt and Road Initiative", the survey said.
On a more positive note, China's cultural influence -- through the arts,
sports and tourism -- remained strong in 2018, while it also made ground
in the fields of education, innovation and technology, and international
engagement, McClory said. "China has great potential to drive the global
agenda forward, but increasing demands for authenticity means that its
soft power efforts must be congruent with its political and economic
pursuits," he said. "China has clearly made gains in developing its soft
power between 2015 and 2018, but progress is rarely a straight line."
Meanwhile, with Beijing and Washington embroiled in a major trade
dispute, the United States also found itself sliding down the chart, to
fourth place in 2018, from third in 2017 and first in 2016. It also fell
four places to 16th on the government subcategory, though still topped
three of the six other composite indexes. Joseph Nye, a Harvard
professor and the originator of the term "soft power", said the US was
counting the cost of it's leader's hard-line approach. "The results of
this year's study show a further erosion of American soft power," he
said. "Clearly, the Trump administration's 'America first' approach to
foreign policy comes at a cost to US global influence." The annual soft
power report was launched in 2015 and ranks the top 30 nations on the
scores awarded to them in seven categories by 11,000 people from 25
countries.

even more staggering for those that have family or friends locked away
for no other crime but practising a faith]{.underline}** - Islam - in a
region where this religion is categorically associated with subversion,
separatism and terrorism. But **[[the internment of one million people
in Xinjiang is only the tip of the ominous state
architecture]{.underline}]{.mark}** of ethnic cleansing against Uighur
Muslims. [The very phrases \"internment\" and \"concentration camps\"
instantly conjure up images of the Holocaust or the rounding up of
Japanese Americans during World War II]{.underline}. Potent analogies
that spurred the New York Times, the Atlantic, and the Intercept to
publish recent pieces documenting [China\'s designation of Islam as a
\"mental illness]{.underline},\" and its merciless objective to
annihilate it by way of a sweeping system of ethnic cleansing, of which
mass internment is only one part. Yet, **[[much of the world remains
unaware of the horrors]{.underline}]{.mark}** unfolding in Xinjiang. And
even more, entirely unacquainted with a people trapped within the belly
of a superpower bent on destroying them. A portrait of Uighur Muslim
history and identity highlights why China, [a communist
nation]{.underline} that enshrines atheism and [privileges its
majority-Han ethnic population]{.underline}, is committed to eliminating
these people. The Uighurs are a stigmatised minority on two fronts:
ethnicity and religion, and trapped within the precarious crosshairs of
an Orwellian police state that views Islam as an affront to
state-sponsored atheism and Uighur identity an obstacle to Han ethnic
supremacy. Uighur Muslims are indigenous to Xinjiang, an autonomous
region in northwest China that borders
[Mongolia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/mongolia.html) to
the northeast, and a myriad of Muslim-majority nations to its left.
After briefly declaring independence in the early 20th century,
Xinjiang - and a sizable population of Uighur Muslims - was annexed by
communist China in 1949, and remains under its authoritarian control
until this day. In addition to religious affinity, Uighur ethnicity
resembles and overlaps with that of its Central Asian neighbours, such
as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and other countries populated with
predominantly Turkic peoples. The region is still called East Turkistan
by Uighur Muslims. In line with this nationalist imagining, Uighur
Muslims also have their own language, Uighur, formerly known as Eastern
Turki, [One million Muslim Uighurs held in secret China camps: UN
panel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/million-muslim-uighurs-held-secret-china-camps-panel-180810185817270.html)
Elements within the Uighur population in China have sought to reclaim
their independence, claiming indigenousness and persecution as bases for
secession from China. In response, China promoted the mass movement of
Han Chinese into the country\'s hinterland, including Xinjiang, which
has effectively reduced Uighur Muslims into a minority on their native
land, strategically preempting the possibility of independence. [The
9/11 terror attacks in the United States created new possibilities for
China to suppress its Uighur Muslim population beyond demographic
engineering]{.underline}. Lockstep, Beijing adopted the American
Islamophobia enshrined by the Bush administration, and seized upon a
\"War on Terror\" that conflated Islam with terrorism. With much of the
world suspicious of Islam and the Global War on Terror fully deployed,
China seized upon a ripe geopolitical landscape that enabled a
relentless and robust crackdown on Uighur Muslims - honing in on Islam
as the pathway to destroy a people refusing to trade in their faith,
language and customs for the alternatives forced upon them by Beijing.
Islam is central to Uighur identity, and religious expression intimately
tied to language and culture. But **[[the War on Terror enabled Beijing
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** target the religious identity of Uighur
Muslims to not only stifle aspirations for independence, but **[[push
towards full-scale ethnic cleaning]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The universal
policing of Muslim expression, in Western and Eastern nations, allowed
China to first \"throw the Uighurs
[under](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/13/china-muslims-uighur-detention/)
the geopolitical bus.\" And in recent years, completely run them over
with an interconnected set of policies that make American or French
[Islamophobia](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/150223070236749.html)
look pedestrian. Yet, [[understanding]{.mark} the broad scale and depth
of [China\'s persecution]{.mark} of Uighur Muslims [is]{.mark} fully
[revealed by its genuine objective:]{.mark} which is transformation and
[annihilation, not ferreting out terrorists]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Criminalising and closely policing Islam, the most conspicuous and
sacred identifier of Uighur identity, is how Beijing seeks to bring
about that goal. In 2015, China
[restricted](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/china-bans-ramadan-fasting-muslim-region-150618070016245.html)Uighur

observing the fast during the month of
[Ramadan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/ramadan-fasting-start-date-170427062743037.html),
which extended beyond the public sphere by way of police intimidation
and surveillance within households during the holy month. This ban was
accompanied,
[according](https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/04/12/china-religious-repression-uighur-muslims)
to Human Rights Watch, by routine state vetting of Uighur imams, close
surveillance of mosques, the removal of religious teachers and students
from schools, restrictions placed on Uighur Muslims to communicate with
family or friends living overseas, and the screening of literature
assigned to students in schools in Xinjiang. While Xinjiang has rapidly
devolved into an open-air prison for Uighur Muslims in recent years, the
open observance of Islam would lead one directly to the most vile type
of Chinese prison: an internment camp designed to \"cure\" one from
Islam and crush the Uighur people. Suppressing the observance of Ramadan
sent a clear message to Uighurs during the most emblematic period of
Muslim life: that expression of Islam will be punished with impunity. In
turn, [the state ban on Ramadan bludgeoned a cornerstone of Uighur
culture and life,]{.underline} and beyond the holy month, [pushed
forward the state
[view](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/infected-08082018173807.html/)
that Islam is \"an ideological illness]{.underline}\" that must be more
than just criminally prosecuted, but pathologically cured. Internment
camps, called \"re-education centres\" by the state, grew in size and
number beginning in 2013. [[Within these overpopulated camps, state

been men, and the Chinese authorities have supplemented the
disproportionate incarceration of men with a
policy[forcing](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/special/uyghur-oppression/ChenPolicy2.html)
Uighur Muslim women to marry (non-Muslim) Han men. Further diluting the
Uighur Muslim population and entrenching Han hegemony. The threat of
internment is a fear that hovers over Xinjiang like a black cloud and
looms heavy in the mind of every Uighur Muslim. Indeed, \"the detentions
and the fear of detention have become an unavoidable fact of daily
life.\" This fear is a weapon that the Chinese government has wielded to
deter and intimidate Uighurs from exercising their faith, enforced by
way of ubiquitous police in Uighur Muslim communities, tapping the
neighbours, [classmates and colleagues of Uighurs]{.underline} to [serve
as]{.underline} data gatherers and [spies]{.underline}, and perhaps most
nefariously, deputising Uighur children to monitor and implicate their
own parents. **[[Big Brother would be a severe
understatement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Chinese authorities in
Xinjiang have enlisted virtually anybody and everybody inside of Uighur
Muslim communities to partake in the project of uprooting Islam. Last
week in The Atlantic, Sigal Samuel
[wrote](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/09/china-internment-camps-uighur-muslim-children/569062/),
\"China\'s crackdown has some Uighurs in Xinjiang worried that their own
children will incriminate them, whether accidentally or because teachers
urge kids to spy on their parents.\" Samuel\'s work helped spur
discussion about the horrors taking place in Xinjiang beyond the
internment camps, which created an entryway to learn about the other
tentacles of China\'s ethnic cleansing programme; particularly those
targeting Uighur children[. China\'s project of breaking up the family
unit]{.underline}, the building block of Uighur Muslim society in
Xinjiang, [is achieved through the routine programme of marshalling
children]{.underline} to report on the religious activities of their
parents to (state-controlled) teachers. But also the formal institution
of state-run orphanages, where the sons and daughters of interned
Uighurs undergo a programme of cultural brainwashing and assimilation
tailored for children. Within the walls of these orphanages,
[where](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Xinjiang:-Children-of-Uyghur-deportees-locked-in-orphanages-44332.html)
\"\[children\] between the ages of six months and 12 years are locked up
like farm animals,\" Chinese authorities carry out what is perhaps the
crux of their ethnic cleansing program: engineering an entire generation
of Uighur Muslims to turn their back on their parents, religion and
culture, in favour of the atheism, Mandarin language and Han customs
privileged by Beijing. In turn, stripping the Uighur people from its
very lifeline, its children, and paving a pathway towards the utter
decimation of 10 million Uighur Muslims, and a nation that existed
before the creation of the modern Chinese state. On Tuesday, September
4, I released a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/KhaledBeydoun/status/1037161235098292225)
about the internment of one million Uighur Muslims that went viral, but
more importantly, caught the attention of Uighur Muslims in the
diaspora. A Uighur graduate student (whose name I will not share for
fear of China seeking retribution against him or his family) in
[England](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/england.html)
contacted me, sharing intimate stories about the trials his family
members and friends endured in the internment camps. Like so many, I
took to the crisis because of the string of headlines documenting the
internment of one million Uighur Muslims, alarmed by how scant coverage
of it was in the mainstream media - and how the world was not only idle
to respond, but largely unaware. \"**[[We are waiting for the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" the student told me on Twitter,
**[[prefacing a statement that would reveal the gravity of the state
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** unleashed on his people: \"**[[We are
waiting for the world to know who we are,]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" he
finished. A basic plea that China efficiently seeks to keep concealed
while systematically policing and punishing every trace of Uighur Muslim
life. In order to comprehend the design of extermination China has
placed upon Uighur Muslims, we must first know who they are as a people.
They are a proud people, whose only crimes are living on a land that has
always been their own and expressing a faith and culture rooted deep in
that soil. Acknowledging their existence, as a global community,

identity, and remove them from memory. **[[It is still not too late for

#### US Heg/Diplomacy is key to pressuring China on human rights violations 

Jodi Xu **Klein 19**, 03-14-19, \"US calls China one of the worst
regimes for human rights in 2018,\" South China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3001594/us-calls-china-one-worst-regimes-human-rights-2018

**[[The United States identified China]{.underline}]{.mark}** Wednesday
**[[as one of the worst countries on the planet]{.underline}]{.mark}**
last year **[[in terms of respecting]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[basic human rights]{.mark}]{.underline}** of its citizens. **[The
State Department's annual human rights report]{.underline}**, released
on Wednesday, **[spotlighted the Chinese government's systematic
internment and possible abuse and torture of as many as two million
Uygur Muslims in]{.underline}** the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur
autonomous region **[in 2018]{.underline}**. The department's Country
Reports on Human Rights Practices, published for the 43rd year, aims to
promote human rights globally, including freedoms of religion or belief,
expression, peaceful assembly and association. [The US]{.underline} has
typically [scored China in these reports for restricting freedom of
speech and assembly and for allowing or committing violence against
religious and ethnic groups]{.underline}. Last year, the report called
China, along with Russia, Iran and North Korea, "forces of instability".
But on Wednesday, **[US Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo said Beijing was
"in a league of its own when it comes to human rights
violations]{.mark}]{.underline}**". "Official **[[repression of the
freedoms of speech, religion, movement, association,]{.mark} and
assembly of [Tibetans]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Tibet autonomous
region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas a**[[nd of Uygurs and other ethnic
and religious minorities]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Xinjiang worsened and
was more severe than in other areas of the country," according to the
2018 report. The report found that during 2018 [the Chinese government
"significantly intensified its campaign of mass detention of members of
Muslim minority groups]{.underline} in Xinjiang". **[The
authorities]{.underline}**, it said, "have **[arbitrarily detained
800,000 to possibly more than two million Uygurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and
other Muslims in internment camps designed to erase religious and ethnic
identities]{.underline}**". News accounts have earlier reported that
more than a million ethnic Uygurs and other largely Muslim ethnic groups
had been detained in extrajudicial internment camps in the Xinjiang
region since a crackdown began in early 2017. Last month, [China was
said to be lobbying to keep the issue off the agenda of the main annual
session of the United Nations' Human Rights Council]{.underline}.
Chinese government officials claim that the camps are educational and
feature "training centres", and are needed to combat terrorism,
separatist movements and extremist activities. Also on Wednesday,
**[[the US co-hosted an event at the UN in Geneva]{.mark}, Switzerland
-- alongside Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Britain -- calling
[for international organisations to make it a priority to put to an end
of the abuses in Xinjiang,]{.mark}]{.underline}** the State Department
said. At the event, according to the department, government officials
and survivors described the severity of the violations of human rights
in the northern Chinese region. In January, **[[as part of a continuing
effort to pressure China to stop its crackdown, a bipartisan group of US
lawmakers nominated the imprisoned Uygur academic Ilham Tohti for the
2019 Nobel Peace Prize.]{.underline}]{.mark}** "[International media,
human rights organisations, and former detainees reported security
officials in the camps abused, tortured, and killed some
detainees]{.underline}," the State Department report said. Wednesday's
report added that "**[[members of the minority Uygur ethnic group
reported systematic torture]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other degrading
treatment by law enforcement officers". The report cited the case of
Abdulreshit Seley Hajim, a Uygur businessman, who died in May or June
while held in an internment camp. According to those interviewed by
Radio Free Asia, he died from strikes to the head with a blunt object,
according to the report. "**[[Survivors stated authorities subjected
individuals in custody to electrocution, waterboarding, beatings, stress
positions, injection of unknown substances, and cold
cells]{.underline}]{.mark}**." According to Human Rights Watch, these
camps focused on "military-style discipline and pervasive political
indoctrination of the detainees". Available information was limited, but
some reports described the withholding of food as punishment for those
who could not learn Chinese phrases and songs, the report said. The
report also cited Beijing's violations and abuses of [other human rights
including unlawful killings by the government, forced disappearance,
torture, arbitrary detention, harsh and life-threatening prison and
detention conditions]{.underline}. Authorities harassed, detained, and
arrested citizens who promoted independent efforts to combat abuses of
power, it said. In November award-winning Chinese documentary
photographer Lu Guang disappeared after travelling to Xinjiang to lead a
photography workshop. A month later, Lu's wife Xu Xiaoli, who lives in
the United States, told the South China Morning Post that her husband
had been arrested by the police. She wasn't told what Lu was charged
with.

### CCP Impact: Japan/Senkaku

#### China is harassing Japan -- A key US ally in the region

Matthew **Continetti 18**, 12-15-2018, \"China's Growing Aggression on
the High Seas,\" National Review,
<https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/12/china-sea-power-challenges-international-order/>

[[China may have moved too quickly in the South and East China Seas,
alerting the world to its ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}. I've had to
wait on the tarmac for planes ahead of mine to take off before, but
never F-15s. [[Naha airport]{.underline}]{.mark} here [[shares a runway
with Japan's Air Self Defense Forces, leading to delays whenever
Japanese fighters scramble to counter Chinese incursions into the
airspace above]{.underline}]{.mark} the Senkaku island chain in the East
China Sea. [[The pace of such incursions has accelerated over the last
half decade]{.underline}. [The Japanese scrambled a high of 1,168 times
in 2016, mostly in response to Chinese
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} The sight of active
afterburners on a U.S. commercial runway would be shocking. In Okinawa,
it's everyday life. [More than 1 million Okinawans share the
southernmost prefecture of Japan with some 25,000 U.S. air, ground,
naval, and Marine forces. More than half of U.S. bases in Japan are
located within these 463 square miles. The crowded space has long been a
site of tension.]{.underline} A brutal crime committed against a local
girl by American soldiers in 1996 precipitated negotiations between the
United States and Japan over the consolidation and relocation of our
forces. The process has been delayed by local and national Japanese
politics. Opposition to the expansion of Camp Schwab in the less densely
populated northern part of the island to replace Futenma airbase became
a rallying cry for opposition lawmakers. The prefectural governor, Denny
Tamaki, was elected on an anti-expansion platform last October. Tamaki
defeated the candidate backed by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
by a surprisingly large margin. His father was a U.S. Marine. The
national interests of the United States, Japan, and China meet in
Okinawa. The island has been essential to the forward deployment of U.S.
forces in Asia since World War II. The base is the keystone of the
U.S.--Japan alliance. Our presence signifies America's guarantee of
Japanese security and helps sustain the economy of Japan's poorest
prefecture. Okinawa is the gateway to mainland Asia for the United
States and Japan. It is for the same reason that China views Okinawa as
an obstacle. Chinese vessels must pass through the Miyako Strait south
of Okinawa to reach the blue waters of the Philippine Sea and, from
there, the "second island chain" encompassing the Mariana Islands, Guam,
Palau, and Borneo. (The third island chain includes Hawaii.) **[[Rising
political, diplomatic, economic, and military tensions between the
United States and China have led many analysts to conclude that the two
powers are beginning a "second Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Kunihiko Miyake of the Canon Institute for Global Studies in Tokyo says
[President [Trump and]{.mark} Chinese leader [Xi Jinping are making the
opening bids in a conflict for hegemony over the western Pacific that
will last decades]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whoever first loses patience, in
his view, will also lose control of the sea lines of communication
essential to the economy and security of the world's most populous
region. Thus **[[the debate in Washington has been over how best to
contain China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From the perspective of China and
Japan, however, China is already contained. Geography locks it in. Tilt
a map of the region 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and you see that the
Sea of Japan and the East and South China Seas are not much different
from great lakes. They are cordoned off by an archipelago that stretches
from Japan's Hokkaido Island through the Senakakus and Taiwan, down to
the Paracel and Spratly islands as well as to the Philippines and
Malaysia. These islands might be called the Great Wall of Democracy.
They limit the force-projection capability of the People's Liberation
Army (PLA). And [their governments present an ideological alternative to
the authoritarianism of the Communist Party. China has responded by
building artificial islands in the South China Sea and investing in
Anti-Access/Area-Denial weaponry targeting U.S. naval and air
forces]{.underline}. Yet former Japanese admiral Yoji Koda observes
that, while China might be able to create new islands, it can't change
the location of entire countries. [China must break through the first
island chain to challenge U.S. supremacy]{.underline} over the blue
waters of the Pacific Ocean. The analysts with whom I met during my week
in Japan, on a trip sponsored by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are
skeptical that the Chinese military will confront the United States
directly. **[[Beijing's strategy seems]{.mark}]{.underline}** rather
**[[to be the slow erosion of America]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s position
[**[through harassment, attrition, the weakening of alliances, and a
steady increase of deterrent capability]{.mark}**. The incessant
violations of Japanese airspace, and the entry of the Chinese coast
guard into Japanese waters, are elements of this program. So are Chinese
island building and the harassment of American planes and
freedom-of-navigation patrols in the South China Sea]{.underline}. Last
September, [**[a Chinese warship came within 45 yards of]{.mark}** the
Decatur**[, an American destroyer]{.mark}**, as it sailed near the

#### China is claiming Japanese territory

aggressive South China Sea tactics on Japan,\" Business Insider,
<https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-china-backing-japan-in-a-corner-2018-1>

**[[China actively wants to change the status quo in the Pacific and
poses a more immediate threat to Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Russia
has also been building up its Pacific fleet to be a formidable force in
the region. Most of Japan\'s response has been geared towards Japan\'s
acquisition of more military equipment and systems. [**[China and Russia
are sending aircraft and naval vessels into Japanese
territory]{.mark}**, and the two countries show no sign of slowing down.
China\'s aggressive activity in the South China Sea is [well
documented](https://www.cfr.org/interactives/chinas-maritime-disputes?cid=otr-marketing_use-china_sea_InfoGuide#!/chinas-maritime-disputes?cid=otr-marketing_use-china_sea_InfoGuide)]{.underline}.
It has disputes with five different countries over a number of islands
and waters that they claim to control. Comparatively, the East China Sea
--- where this conflict with Japan has been unfolding --- has been much
more calm. **[[At the center of China and Japan\'s feud is the Senkaku
Islands, a group of uninhabited islands under Japanese control, but
claimed by China]{.underline}]{.mark}** who call them the Diaoyu
Islands. Richard [Weitz, a senior fellow and the director of the Center

#### US military alliance with Japan and South Korea is key to checking Chinese, North Korean, and Iranian aggression 

John **Grady 18**, 8-13-2018, \"Panel: Japan Still Needs U.S. Protection
from North Korean, Chinese Aggression,\" USNI News,
<https://news.usni.org/2018/08/13/panel-japan-still-needs-u-s-protection-north-korean-chinese-aggression>

**[[Japan doesn't have an alternative to its American alliance when
confronting]{.mark} North Korea]{.underline}**'s missile and nuclear
weapons threat **[or [Beijing's territorial
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a panel of regional experts agreed on
Friday. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe "wants to make sure the
United States doesn't get too far ahead" of Tokyo in defusing the
still-volatile security situation on the Korean Peninsula or in its
dealings with China on economic and diplomatic concerns across the
Indo-Pacific, said Sheila Smith a senior fellow at the Council of
Foreign Relations. Japan has felt more pressure on what happens on the
peninsula in the future because it was not given a heads-up that
President Donald Trump was going to offer to talk directly with North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Pyongyang's weapons programs, Smith [said
at the Heritage Foundation in Washington,
D.C.](https://www.heritage.org/asia/event/japan-americas-neglected-ally)
Nor were they briefed on what concessions in terms of military presence
in Korea or guarantees of response if attacked the administration was
willing to make to eventually end the North's nuclear weapons and
missile testing and production. Behind the scenes, since the meeting has
ended, [the Japanese have been touching base with the nations who
supported the U.N. decision to send troops to Korea in 1950 to ensure
their commitment to conditions now]{.underline} and continued sanctions
pressure. They also have reached out to the Russians to ensure "a very
concerted global response" remains in place. [**Tokyo also, for more
than a year, has been involving South Korea in military exercises it
conducts with the United States to send a message to Pyongyang that the
three are united**]{.underline} despite separate security arrangements.
**["Don't take these two alliances as separate" if planning to attack
Seoul by crossing a land border or striking Tokyo with short-range
missiles or targeting Washington with intercontinental-range
missiles]{.underline}**, she said. Smith called these moves to have the
three militaries train together "unprecedented," but whether those kinds
of exercises will continue is unclear. To Japan, **[[Beijing's
territorial assertiveness isn't confined to the building of artificial
islands and positioning naval and air forces on these reclaimed reefs in
the South China Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**, said Tsuneo "Nabe" Watanabe,
a senior fellow at Sasakawa Peace Foundation. **[[China's constant
aerial and maritime probing of islands Tokyo's considers its own limits
what Japan can do militarily in other parts of the
Pacific.]{.underline}]{.mark}** "A lot depends upon capability" to
deliver vessels that Japan does not have with its coast guard and navy
tied up patrolling its territorial seas against its close-by neighbor's
testing, menacing behavior and sometimes intrusion, he said. Abe has
brought Japan's Self-Defense Forces, most often its navy and coast
guard, into the international picture --- most commonly in delivering
humanitarian aid and participating in anti-piracy missions and
counterterrorism operations. ln addition, Kent Calder, director for East
Asia Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said **[[the Japanese could be
a very effective partner with the United States in providing its
extensive minesweeping force for deployment in the South China Sea and
the Straits of Hormuz as deterrents to the Chinese and the
Iranians]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Where Japan is hedging its bets is in
trade, the panelists agreed. While Abe has "sought to inform and
explain" to Trump the downsides of keeping Tokyo at arm's length on
economic issues and the value of working together on building stronger
and more stable economies across the Indo-Pacific, he has met with
little success. Watanabe said, Japanese "auto manufacturers are fearful"
of what happens next. If tariffs, particularly on its automobile
manufacturers, are imposed "Japan will retaliate" on U.S. agriculture,
Smith said. And with that looming, the panelists cited Abe's recent
talks with the European Union to expand businesses there, Tokyo's
payment of outstanding World War II debt to clear the decks for new
agreements and discussions with India about how to build economic ties
and expand those regionally as other examples of Japan looking out for
its own interests. Calder said Japanese businessmen, but less so its
government, see some promise in the investment bank part China's One
Belt/One Road initiative to build infrastructure across Asia and the
Pacific. "There's more pragmatism in the business world" when it comes
to proposals like that without considering security policy implications.
He compared the recent American proposal to invest \$113 million in
development packages for the region compared to China's \$900 billion as
an example to show what would be more attractive to the private sector.
"The scale does create some business interest" to look more deeply into
possibilities of working with the Chinese. This has become particularly
true following the Trump administration's pulling the United States out
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and walking away from the Iranian
nuclear agreement. A summit meeting between Abe and Chinese President Xi
Jinping to go over trade between the two nations, what to do about North
Korean weapons programs and steps to denuclearize the peninsula and what
each is doing now with Iran following the U.S. pullout is possible soon.
Foreign ministers covered much of this ground in a spring meeting in
Tokyo. For example concerning the impact of the nuclear agreement
pullout, China intends to keep importing oil from Iran at the same
levels it has since the pact was signed. It dismisses the United States'
threatening sanctions against nations trading with Tehran. Exactly how
the European Union and Japan will respond in terms of trade with Iran is
not as clear as long as Tehran sticks to the letter of the agreement.
Smith said Abe stressed to Trump in several meetings "let's set the
table on the Indo-Pacific" together and approach security and trade
regionally. "What are the rules of the road" Japan and the United States
want for the Indo-Pacific and, specifically, China's engagement or its
continued attempts at coercion, she asked rhetorically.

### CCP Impact: Senkaku

#### China rise wrecks alliance credibility and causes conflict over the Senkaku islands

Matthew **Continetti 18**, 12-15-2018, \"China's Growing Aggression on
the High Seas,\" National Review,
<https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/12/china-sea-power-challenges-international-order/>

[[China may have moved too quickly in the South and East China Seas,
alerting the world to its ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}. I've had to
wait on the tarmac for planes ahead of mine to take off before, but
never F-15s. [[Naha airport]{.underline}]{.mark} here [[shares a runway
with Japan's Air Self Defense Forces, leading to delays whenever
Japanese fighters scramble to counter Chinese incursions into the
airspace above]{.underline}]{.mark} the Senkaku island chain in the East
China Sea. [[The pace of such incursions has accelerated over the last
half decade]{.underline}. [The Japanese scrambled a high of 1,168 times
in 2016, mostly in response to Chinese
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} The sight of active
afterburners on a U.S. commercial runway would be shocking. In Okinawa,
it's everyday life. [More than 1 million Okinawans share the
southernmost prefecture of Japan with some 25,000 U.S. air, ground,
naval, and Marine forces. More than half of U.S. bases in Japan are
located within these 463 square miles. The crowded space has long been a
site of tension.]{.underline} A brutal crime committed against a local
girl by American soldiers in 1996 precipitated negotiations between the
United States and Japan over the consolidation and relocation of our
forces. The process has been delayed by local and national Japanese
politics. Opposition to the expansion of Camp Schwab in the less densely
populated northern part of the island to replace Futenma airbase became
a rallying cry for opposition lawmakers. The prefectural governor, Denny
Tamaki, was elected on an anti-expansion platform last October. Tamaki
defeated the candidate backed by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
by a surprisingly large margin. His father was a U.S. Marine. The
national interests of the United States, Japan, and China meet in
Okinawa. The island has been essential to the forward deployment of U.S.
forces in Asia since World War II. The base is the keystone of the
U.S.--Japan alliance. Our presence signifies America's guarantee of
Japanese security and helps sustain the economy of Japan's poorest
prefecture. Okinawa is the gateway to mainland Asia for the United
States and Japan. It is for the same reason that China views Okinawa as
an obstacle. Chinese vessels must pass through the Miyako Strait south
of Okinawa to reach the blue waters of the Philippine Sea and, from
there, the "second island chain" encompassing the Mariana Islands, Guam,
Palau, and Borneo. (The third island chain includes Hawaii.) **[[Rising
political, diplomatic, economic, and military tensions between the
United States and China have led many analysts to conclude that the two
powers are beginning a "second Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Kunihiko Miyake of the Canon Institute for Global Studies in Tokyo says
[President [Trump and]{.mark} Chinese leader [Xi Jinping are making the
opening bids in a conflict for hegemony over the western Pacific that
will last decades]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whoever first loses patience, in
his view, will also lose control of the sea lines of communication
essential to the economy and security of the world's most populous
region. Thus **[[the debate in Washington has been over how best to
contain China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From the perspective of China and
Japan, however, China is already contained. Geography locks it in. Tilt
a map of the region 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and you see that the
Sea of Japan and the East and South China Seas are not much different
from great lakes. They are cordoned off by an archipelago that stretches
from Japan's Hokkaido Island through the Senakakus and Taiwan, down to
the Paracel and Spratly islands as well as to the Philippines and
Malaysia. These islands might be called the Great Wall of Democracy.
They limit the force-projection capability of the People's Liberation
Army (PLA). And [their governments present an ideological alternative to
the authoritarianism of the Communist Party. China has responded by
building artificial islands in the South China Sea and investing in
Anti-Access/Area-Denial weaponry targeting U.S. naval and air
forces]{.underline}. Yet former Japanese admiral Yoji Koda observes
that, while China might be able to create new islands, it can't change
the location of entire countries. [China must break through the first
island chain to challenge U.S. supremacy]{.underline} over the blue
waters of the Pacific Ocean. The analysts with whom I met during my week
in Japan, on a trip sponsored by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are
skeptical that the Chinese military will confront the United States
directly. **[[Beijing's strategy seems]{.mark}]{.underline}** rather
**[[to be the slow erosion of America]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s position
[**[through harassment, attrition, the weakening of alliances, and a
steady increase of deterrent capability]{.mark}**. The incessant
violations of Japanese airspace, and the entry of the Chinese coast
guard into Japanese waters, are elements of this program. So are Chinese
island building and the harassment of American planes and
freedom-of-navigation patrols in the South China Sea]{.underline}. Last
September, [**[a Chinese warship came within 45 yards of]{.mark}** the
Decatur**[, an American destroyer]{.mark}**, as it sailed near the
Spratly Islands. For U.S. analysts, **[the incident represented a change
in Chinese rules of engagement. The PLA is more accepting of
risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[Its quickened activity has established
a new normal in theater]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[China might not seek
a frontal confrontation with U.S. forces at this time, but the wish

The original founders of ASEAN were pro western dictatorships that had
come to power in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the
Philippines. At the height of the war in Vietnam in 1967, these
countries founded the organization and ten years later created a
secretariat in Jakarta and began the process of building network of
transnational agencies with different offices in different countries
such as centers for disaster relief, energy, biodiversity, meteorology,
etc. Brunei joined the group in 1984 and Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Myanmar and
Cambodia at the end of the last century. **[[Since 2003, ASEAN
has]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[been developing the ASEAN Free Trade
Area]{.underline}]{.mark}** (AFTA) which is working to lower tariffs
across the region on a wide range of goods and services. Currently
**[[there is considerable work being done to expand the idea and create
an East Asian Community along the lines of the

[here](http://asean.org/storage/2017/04/FINAL-Chairmans-Statement-of-30th-ASEAN-Summit-29-Apr-2017.pdf),
consists of 124 articles over 25 pages covering all aspects of the
organization's development spanning a wide array of topics, initiatives,
and framework agreements. **[[Article 100, for example, re-iterated the
group's commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate

Chairman's message was
[reportedly](https://www.voanews.com/a/duterte-south-china-sea-asean-statement/3831645.html)
revised to soften the language concerning China's activities and to

### CCP Ext: A2 CCP Collapse

#### CCP will not collapse.

Arthur **Kroeber 15** (Arthur R. Kroeber, Editor at Dragonomics and
China Economic Quarterly, "When Will China's Government Collapse?"
Foreign Policy, March 13, 2015,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/13/china_communist_party_collapse_downfall/)

[Neither China nor its Communist Party is cracking up.]{.underline} I
have three reasons for this judgment. First, none of the factors
Shambaugh cites strongly supports the crackup case. Second, the balance
of evidence suggests that Xi's government is not weak and desperate, but
forceful and adaptable. [Third, the forces that might push for systemic
political change are far weaker than the party]{.underline}. Shambaugh
thinks the system is on its last legs because rich people are moving
assets abroad, Xi is cracking down on the media and academia, officials
look bored in meetings, corruption is rife, and the economy is at an
impasse. This is not a persuasive case. True, many rich Chinese are
moving money abroad, both to find safe havens and to diversify their
portfolios as China's growth slows. [But in aggregate, capital outflows
are modest, and plenty of rich Chinese are still investing in their own
economy. Following an easing of rules, new private business
registrations rose 45 percent in 2014 --- scarcely a sign that the
entrepreneurial class has given up hope]{.underline}. [The crackdown on
free expression and civil society is deeply distressing, but not
necessarily a sign of weakness]{.underline}. [It could equally be seen
as]{.underline} an assertion of confidence in the success of China's
authoritarian-capitalist model, and [a rejection of the idea that China
needs to make concessions to liberal-democratic ideas to keep on
going]{.underline}. It is also related to the crackdown on corruption,
which Shambaugh wrongly dismisses as a cynical power play. [Corruption
at the end of the era of Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao had got out of
control, and posed a real risk of bringing down the regime. A relentless
drive to limit corruption was essential to stabilize the system, and
this is precisely what Xi has delivered]{.underline}. It cannot work
unless Xi can demonstrate complete control over all aspects of the
political system, including ideology. As for the economy and the reform
program, it is first worth pointing out that despite its severe
slowdown, [China's economy continues to grow faster than that of any
other major country in the world. And claims that the reform program is
sputtering simply do not square with the facts. 2014 saw the start of a
crucial program to revamp the fiscal system, which led to the start of
restructuring local government debt]{.underline}; first steps to
liberalize the one-child policy and the hukou, or household registration
system (discussed for years but never achieved by previous governments);
important changes in energy pricing; and linkage of the Shanghai and
Hong Kong stock markets. News reports suggest that we will soon see a
program to reorganize big SOEs under Temasek-like holding companies that
will focus on improving their flagging financial returns. These are all
material achievements and compare favorably to, for instance, the utter
failure of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to progress on any of the
reform agenda he outlined for his country two years ago. Finally, there
is no evidence that the biggest and most important political
constituency in China --- t[he rising urban bourgeoisie]{.underline} ---
has much interest in changing the system. In my conversations with
members of this class, I hear many complaints, but more [generally a
satisfaction with the material progress China has made]{.underline} in
the last two decades. Except for a tiny group of brave dissidents, this
group in general displays little interest in political reform and none
in democracy. One reason may be that they find uninspiring the record of
democratic governance in other big Asian countries, such as India. More
important is probably the fear that in a representative system, the
interests of the urban bourgeoisie (at most 25 percent of the
population) would lose out to those of the rural masses. The party may
well be somewhat insecure, but the only force that might plausibly
unseat it is more insecure still. [Predictions of Chinese political
collapse have a long and futile history. Their persistent failure stems
from a basic conceptual fault. Instead of facing the Chinese system on
its own terms and understanding why it work]{.underline}s --- which
could create insights into why it might stop working --- [critics judge
the system against what they would like it to be, and find it
wanting]{.underline}. This embeds an assumption of fragility that makes
every societal problem look like an existential crisis. As a long-term
resident of China, I would love the government to become more open,
pluralistic and tolerant of creativity. That it refuses to do so is
disappointing to me and many others, but offers no grounds for a
judgment of its weakness. Seven years ago, in his excellent book China's
Communist Party: Atrophy and Adaptation, Shambaugh described the Party
as "a reasonably strong and resilient institution.... To be sure, [it
has its problems and challenges]{.underline}, [but none present the real
possibility of systemic collapse."]{.underline} That was a good judgment
then, and it remains a good judgment now.

#### No CCP collapse or lashout

**Pei 9** (Minxin, Senior Associate in the China Program at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, 3/12. "Will the Chinese Communist
Party Survive the Crisis?" Foreign Affairs.

It might seem reasonable to expect that challenges from the disaffected
urban middle class, frustrated college graduates, and unemployed
migrants will constitute the principal threat to the party\'s rule. If
those groups were in fact to band together in a powerful coalition, then
the world\'s longest-ruling party would indeed be in deep trouble. But
that is not going to happen. Such [[a revolutionary scenario overlooks
two critical forces blocking political change in
China]{.underline}]{.mark} and similar authoritarian political systems:
[the [regime\'s capacity for repression and the unity among the
elite]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Economic crisis and social
unrest]{.underline}]{.mark} [may make it tougher for the CCP to govern,
but they [will not loosen the party\'s hold on power]{.mark}. A glance
at countries such as Zimbabwe, North Korea, Cuba, and Burma shows
that]{.underline} a relatively [unified elite in control of the military
and police can cling to power through brutal force, even in the face of
abysmal economic failure]{.underline}. Disunity within the ruling elite,
on the other hand, weakens the regime\'s repressive capacity and usually
spells the rulers\' doom. [[The CCP has already demonstrated its
remarkable ability to contain and suppress chronic social protest and
small-scale dissident movements]{.mark}. The regime maintains the
People\'s Armed Police]{.underline}, a well-trained and well-equipped
anti-riot force of 250,000. In addition, [China\'s secret police are
among the most capable in the world]{.underline} and are augmented by a
vast network of informers. And although the Internet may have made
control of information more difficult, [Chinese censors]{.underline} can
still [react quickly and thoroughly to end the dissemination of
dangerous news]{.underline}. Since the Tiananmen crackdown, the Chinese
government has greatly refined its repressive capabilities. [[Responding
to tens of thousands of riots each year has made Chinese law enforcement
the most experienced in the world at crowd control and
dispersion]{.underline}]{.mark}. Chinese state security services have
applied the tactic of \"political decapitation\" to great effect,
quickly arresting protest leaders and leaving their followers
disorganized, demoralized, and impotent. If worsening economic
conditions lead to a potentially explosive political situation, the
party will stick to these tried-and-true practices to ward off any
organized movement against the regime.

### CCP Ext: A2 China Soft Power

#### China will fill in -- decks China soft power

**Shinnie 17** James Shinnie, Intern in the Military Sciences research
group at RUSI, 4-1-2017. Chinese Arms Exports Contradict Its
International Messaging. RUSI.
https://rusi.org/publication/rusi-defence-systems/chinese-arms-exports-contradict-its-international-messaging
/jh

[The increasing presence of Chinese arms throughout much of Africa and
the Middle East comes at a time when]{.underline} the People's Republic
of [China]{.underline} (PRC) [is attempting to revamp its image through
international engagement]{.underline}, deploying ever increasing numbers
to peacekeeping deployments throughout Africa.

[China is now the largest single contributor of personnel to UN
peacekeeping]{.underline}, despite only having begun contributing to
such operations in 1992. Although China has been a quiet economic
presence in Africa for many years, building infrastructure at knock-down
prices compared with Western actors, its engagement as a security player
is still a work in progress. It is, therefore, an excellent time to
examine the growing Chinese role in Africa, contrasting its enthusiasm
for peacekeeping with its increasing role as an international arms
manufacturer.

[From 2010 to 2015, China's arms trade grew by 143%, making the PRC the
world's third largest exporter of arms. Two-thirds of African countries
now make use of arms manufactured by China]{.underline}, from cheap
copies of small weapons to complex ocean-going naval vessels.

Chinese weaponry has filled the market niche traditionally occupied by
the cheap Soviet weaponry that previously equipped many African nations.
[With most legacy Soviet surplus equipment now reaching the end of its
practical service life, African countries must seek alternative sources
for the cheap defence equipment they need to maintain internal
security.]{.underline}

Chinese arms manufacturer NORINCO has become a particularly widespread
manufacturer, with its arms in use in the majority of sub-Saharan and
central African nations.

While some might associate [China]{.underline} entirely with knock-offs,
its [growth as a defence manufacturer has been bolstered in recent years
by its forays into more complex arms]{.underline}. The
[Chinese-Pakistani made K-8 Karakorum jet trainer is now in service with
Egypt, Ghana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Sudan.]{.underline}

The PRC claims with some pride that [K-8s comprise 80% of the jet
trainer aircraft in Africa]{.underline}. Along with it being an
indigenous development, the K-8 is particularly notable due to the ease
with which it can be converted over to a light-attack role for
counterinsurgency operations.

In addition to jet aircraft, China has sold offshore patrol vessels and
other complex naval vessels to nations, including Algeria, Nigeria,
Angola, Ghana and Cameroon. To compliment their sales of advanced arms,
China has already built a large maintenance base in Africa with more in
development. A naval base in Djibouti will soon be joined by aircraft
maintenance and training facilities in Tanzania and the Republic of
Congo.

Often considered one of the most advanced and complex areas of defence
technology, unmanned aerial vehicle ([UAV]{.underline})
[development]{.underline} [is also an area in which China is making
significant strides]{.underline}, with the PRC's International Aero
Development Corporation leading the way.

China's indigenously developed [Wing Loong II]{.underline} is an armed
drone not dissimilar to the US-made MQ-9 Reaper [and has been sold to
Nigeria, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates]{.underline}. With their
plans to manufacture the CH-4 Caihong platform in Saudi Arabia, [China
appears likely to develop into a serious alternative provider for states
looking to purchase UAVs]{.underline}. At the same time, [UAVs are
allowing China to expand its sales base beyond Africa]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [China has made clear and confident steps into areas of
defence manufacturing it was not previously proficient in, and with
global instability continuing apace the PRC is likely to have an
increasing market for its products.]{.underline}

While the arms industry has an at best chequered record in terms of
ensuring its products do not end up in the wrong hands, [China's
exploits in this area have crossed into even murkier areas than
usual.]{.underline}

[China has been consistently embarrassed by its arms shipments turning
up in the hands of militants or dissidents of all colours]{.underline},
and [Beijing has]{.underline} at times [circumvented]{.underline} the
[arms embargoes]{.underline} which prevent western arms manufacturers
from accessing certain markets. [Chinese-made RPGs have been found in
the hands of Somali pirates,]{.underline} and [some believe Beijing may
have supplied the C-801 and C-802A missiles recently fired at US Navy
ships by]{.underline} the [Houthis]{.underline} off the coast of Yemen.

In Darfur in 2011, a UN team found [high-explosive shells]{.underline}
in a recently abandoned rebel position. These shells [were]{.underline}
[eventually found to have been manufactured in China and exported to
South Sudan immediately prior to the embargo against
Darfur.]{.underline}

China responded to accusations of having circumvented the embargo by
trying to suppress the findings of the UN, blocking a release by the
investigators concerned which pointed a finger squarely at the PRC. It
appears that China was willing to sell arms to Sudanese groups which
would then move the weapons to Darfur, outmanoeuvring the embargo
against Darfur.

Similarly, when Zimbabwe was faced with a fresh round of sanctions in
2005, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe urged his citizens to 'look east'
to find arms. Shortly afterwards, in 2008, the Chinese delivered 77
tonnes of small-arms to Zimbabwe in a single shipment. [Chinese arms
have become a stubborn presence in the hands of both state and non-state
groups, which is at odds with China's new public commitment to African
peacekeeping.]{.underline}

In 2015, the PRC achieved two significant milestones in its advancement
as a peacekeeping power. President Xi Jinping delegated 8,000 Chinese
soldiers to the UN's standby force, totalling one-fifth of the total
troops in the force; as well as giving \$100 million to the African
Union's standby force, with another \$1 billion going to the UN Peace
and Development Trust Fund.

Chinese security forces deployed to Mali in 2013 and a battalion of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) deployed to South Sudan in 2014, the
latter being China's first deployment of army personnel to another
continent. In late 2016, China announced its intention to deploy an
operational helicopter unit to South Sudan, with shipments of the
materials required beginning in October of that same year.

The accelerated deployments of Chinese forces to peacekeeping are ironic
given the PRC's historical disdain for UN peacekeeping, which until 1981
it had entirely abstained from voting on. The early twenty-first century
has seen China step up to a more robust international role, utilising
its military to show the world that it intends to be a responsible
global power.

In the words of Shen Dingli, the head of the America studies centre at
Fudan University in Shanghai, [China views peacekeeping as 'a chance to
lift its international image']{.underline}, while contributing to the
maintenance of security in the developing world.

[This is somewhat at odds with China's less than morally clean
arms-trading policies.]{.underline} It might be reasonably suggested
then that China merely intends to exert influence on the world stage,
and is perhaps not overly concerned as to the nature of this influence.

China's presence as a security actor is growing, with the PRC willing to
both contribute to security by peacekeeping as well as offer other
powers the arms with which they can maintain security themselves. China
could not realistically be considered a security actor in Africa on a
par with the US or France until it is able to launch a moderately
successful unilateral intervention itself, and this sort of capability
and political intent still appears some way off.

However, in the meantime, [China's presence in Africa is likely to grow,
realised through ongoing peacekeeping deployments and the cheap and
unscrupulous provision of Chinese arms to African powers.]{.underline}
Peacekeeping deployments allow the Chinese Army to gain operational
experience and test their organisational structures.

Similarly, [when Chinese arms are used by foreign powers, Beijing is
able to consider the technical merits of their designs at no risk to
their own citizens just as the Soviet Union did during the Cold
War.]{.underline}

China's engagement with Africa, in terms of arms-sales and peacekeeping,
allows it an arena in which to develop as a security actor, gaining both
technical and military experience. With conflicts around the Lake Chad
basin and Sahel showing no signs of abating, and conflict in other areas
of Africa showing signs of resurgence, the [market for Chinese arms is
most certainly going to remain open.]{.underline}

spokesman was frank: \"Let\'s say the price difference could have been
manageable. But the issue of technology transfer was more important. On
this issue, our allies, including the United States, caused a big
disappointment. \"25 Turkey explicitly seeks to enter the top echelon of
arms exporters, and under- stands it needs foreign technology to do
so.26 Should it fail, like so many [[aspiring]{.mark}
[exporters]{.mark}]{.underline} do, it will have consumed enormous
amounts of the country\'s resources to produce a product that could be
bought easily from any number of existing pro- ducers. Should it
succeed, it will join a very crowded field. [Growing
[competition]{.mark} [will lead to more
proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[fewer scruples about corruption
and human rights, and generous]{.underline}]{.mark} amounts of
[[technology transfer]{.underline}]{.mark} to clients. The consequences
of [a desperate [Russia\'s]{.mark} [freewheeling]{.mark} [export]{.mark}

2000s clearly [[helped fuel China\'s own]{.underline}]{.mark}
[increasingly successful international sales push]{.underline}. 27
Finally, transferring technology and production to the client can hinder
human rights and anti-corruption efforts in more direct ways. For
example, shifting production of sensitive components to third-party
countries has allowed German defense firms to skirt their home
country\'s export regulations.28 And [the entry of desperate second-tier
suppliers shapes U.S. behavior in turn]{.underline}. [The presence of
alternate sources, also known as [the \"gray threat]{.mark},\" [has an
effect even on the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [as shown by the

[sales]{.mark} [to Egypt]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Thailand presents a
similar example]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, the Thai military\'s traditional supplier, largely
[ceased]{.underline} both [arms sales]{.underline} and military
assistance [after that country\'s]{.underline} 2014 [coup]{.underline}.
[Thailand]{.underline} accordingly [pro- cured weapons from relatively
new suppliers, such as China, Russia, and Ukraine]{.underline}, [and has
strengthened ties with]{.underline} suppliers from [Israel, Sweden,
and]{.underline} other countries in [Europe]{.underline}. [The

### Heg I/L: Arms Sales Key

#### Arms sales create norms and security partners necessary for US leadership

**Thompson 18**, Andrea Thompson (Under Secretary for Arms Control and
International Security at the U.S. State Department), December 9 2018,
"US undersecretary of state for arms control: Creating a flexible,
effective foreign policy tool",
https://www.defensenews.com/outlook/2018/12/10/us-undersecretary-of-state-for-arms-control-creating-a-flexible-effective-foreign-policy-tool/

[Arms transfers are a central pillar of America's international security
cooperation, and]{.underline} they are also an important part of [the
American economy]{.underline}. This dual role as a tool of both foreign
policy and economic security --- combined with the unique nature of the
goods and services involved --- makes arms transfer policy uniquely
complex. Recognizing these factors, the [U.S. government oversees and
manages our defense trade unlike any other sector of the export
economy]{.underline}. At the heart of this process is the State
Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, supported by the
Department of Defense. [The bureau vets each potential sale against
legal, regulatory and policy standards through the rubric of the
president's Conventional Arms Transfer Policy]{.underline}. [The new
Conventional Arms Transfer Policy]{.underline}, which President Donald
Trump approved in April 2018, [lays out a comprehensive set of
considerations that must be taken into account in reviewing every
potential arms transfer. While the policy is designed as a practical
framework for such decisions, it can also be read as an explanation of
the potential benefits of these transfers for our national security and
global security]{.underline}. [Well-considered arms transfers can
bolster the security of the United States and our allies and partners.
Examples include defending against external coercion and providing
capabilities in support of shared security objectives, such as
countering terrorism, trafficking and transnational organized crime.
They can forge and strengthen long-term relationships and enhance
military interoperability. Arms transfers can help maintain the U.S.
military's technological advantages and lower its own procurement costs,
strengthen America's manufacturing and defense-industrial base, and even
facilitate ally and partner efforts to reduce the risk of military
operations causing civilian harm.]{.underline} While readers of Defense
News may be familiar with these benefits, [it is indisputable that arms
transfers also come with risks]{.underline}. In the past year in
particular, many in Congress, the media and the public have expressed
serious concerns about particular sales. I acknowledge the gravity of
these risks and will be as clear with the reader in these open pages as
I am with our partners privately: The misuse of U.S. defense equipment
--- whether illegal retransfers, illicit exploitation or immoral
utilization --- is anathema to this and to any administration, and is
addressed with the utmost seriousness in every instance by the executive
--- and often legislative --- branches of the U.S. government. [In
making transfer decisions]{.underline}, and in following up with our
partners after a transfer, the [departments of State and Defense work to
ensure that U.S. arms transfers are used appropriately and that they
deliver significant foreign policy benefits, contributing to both
regional stability and U.S. national security]{.underline}. Such
positive outcomes were very much in evidence to me when I traveled to
Europe and the Middle East this fall. In Poland, I found a close ally
whose location at the eastern edge of NATO has given it a front row seat
to Russia's occupation of Crimea, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as
its military buildup in Kaliningrad. In this context, the U.S.-Poland
defense trade relationship mirrors the closeness of our alliance and
demonstrates how we work together to address shared security objectives.
For instance, Polish procurement of the Patriot air and missile defense
system will increase the defensive capabilities of the Polish military
to guard against hostile aggression while also shielding NATO allies who
often train and operate within Poland's borders. Poland's investment in
its F-16 fighter program enhances Poland's ability to provide for its
own territorial defense and support coalition operations. In a gesture
that is emblematic of our defense trade relationship, the Polish
government has invited the United States to be the lead nation in the
2019 International Defence Industry Exhibition in Kielce, a role we have
enthusiastically accepted. How can arms sales be sped up in the Trump
era? On that same trip, but in a very different context, I saw how [U.S.
arms transfers bolster our relationship with a key partner in the Middle
East]{.underline}, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. [Our arms transfers
to Jordan assist the kingdom in performing its]{.underline} instrumental
[role as a leading partner in the coalition to degrade and defeat the
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and contribute to regional stability in
ways that often go unrecognized]{.underline} For instance,
U.S.-manufactured vehicles and munitions have assisted Jordan in
securing its border with Syria; U.S. coastal patrol boats have helped
enable Jordan to conduct maritime patrols in the Gulf of Aqaba; Jordan's
F-16 fleet has contributed to U.S.-led coalitions in Libya, Iraq and
Syria; and, when tragedy struck during flash flooding in October, Jordan
deployed U.S.-manufactured helicopters to lead its search, rescue and
recovery operations. As President Trump has often said, "[economic
security is national security]{.underline}." As undersecretary of state
for arms control and international security, that is a tenet I continue
to observe in action --- from the American worker on the production
line, to the Polish pilot on the flight line, to the Jordanian rescuer
on the harness line. [Through the framework laid out by the president's
Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, this administration is working every
day to ensure that arms transfers are a flexible and effective tool of
U.S. foreign policy, supporting the capacity of our partners, the growth
of our economy and the security of the American people.]{.underline}

### Heg I/L: Arms Sales Counter China

#### Increasing Chinese sales supplants US leadership and strategic interests

Daniel **Darling** **19**, 7-8-2019, \"China's Arms Exports: Up, Up and
Away,\" Defense Security Monitor,
https://dsm.forecastinternational.com/wordpress/2019/05/09/chinas-arms-exports-up-up-and-away/

From [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} vantage point, its [[arms
exports]{.mark} [help]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[promote]{.mark} its
[growing self-sufficiency]{.mark}]{.underline} [in defense technology,
[wield increasing global influence, and support]{.mark} Beijing's
[broader foreign policy aims]{.mark}]{.underline} be they [[economic,
political or military]{.mark}. [For now, Chinese arms sales pose a
modest challenge to U.S. interests]{.mark} [and]{.mark} Washington's
[stature]{.mark} as the leading global defense supplier]{.underline}.
Indeed, [China's arms export success has eaten into Russia's market
share]{.underline} [and presented [a greater challenge to Moscow
than]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} going forward, [with Chinese defense
tech]{.underline}nologies developing and [maturing]{.underline} and
China's influence in areas such as Africa increasing, [[the U.S.
will]{.mark}]{.underline} inevitably [[feel the brunt of greater
competition from its preeminent strategic rival]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Arms sales are a key tool to counter Chinese influence 

**Huang 18**, Kristin Huang (senior China reporter, focus on diplomacy
and defence), March 12 2018, "China's arms sales rise as it vies with US
for influence on the world stage",
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2136877/chinas-arms-sales-rise-it-vies-us-influence-world-stage

[The rivalry between [America and China]{.mark} has seen [both]{.mark}
sides [step up]{.mark} international [arms sales]{.mark} and transfers
[as they seek to strengthen military ties with key
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a report published on Monday.
The study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI), which examined the volume of international transfers of major
weapons between 2008 and 2017, showed China's arms exports represented
5.7 per cent of the world's share of arms exports between 2013-17 -- up
by more than a third from the 4.6 per cent recorded between 2008-12. The
report was published a week [after China unveiled an 8.1 per cent
increase in military spending over a three-year period]{.underline},
although China's state media defended the rise as proportionate and low,
adding that it would not lead to an arms race with the United States.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has dubbed China as a
"rival", and the latest SIPRI report shows how the [[US]{.mark} has
[use]{.mark}d [arms transfers as]{.mark} a foreign policy [tool to
offset Beijing's growing]{.mark} [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, US arms deliveries to India grew by 557 per cent between 2008
and 2017, the year China and India became embroiled in a protracted
border dispute over the Doklam region in the Himalayas. "This
development is part of the growing strategic partnership between the two
countries under which the USA has begun to supply India with advanced
military equipment," the report said. The US has also started to
increase its security cooperation with Vietnam, which is embroiled in a
dispute with Beijing over the South China Sea. In 2017 it delivered one
patrol ship, the USS Morgenthau, to Vietnam -- the first major US arms
transfer to that country. Tensions between China and Japan in the East
China Sea also saw Japan moving closer to the US, the report said. It
said Tokyo turned to the US for several types of advanced weapons
between 2013 and 2017, including the first batches of a total of 42
combat aircraft. Japan also ordered advanced air and missile defence
systems from the US in the same period. But in cases where US relations
with other countries had deteriorated the result was a fall in arms
transfers. For example, the report said that Venezuela, which once
relied on the US as its main arms supplier, had rebuilt its armed forces
with weapons from China and Russia after ties with Washington soured
following the Hugo Chavez's election as president in 1999. China, India
should build ties, resolve differences through mutual trust, Beijing
says [[As China became increasingly capable of producing]{.mark} its
[own]{.mark} advanced [weapons, its arms exports increased]{.mark} by
[38 per cent]{.mark} and its arms imports decreased by 19 per
cent]{.underline} in 2013-2017 compared with 2008-2012. The report
showed China delivered major arms to 48 countries in the past five
years, with Pakistan topping the list, followed by Bangladesh and
Algeria. "China was the largest arms supplier to Pakistan in 2008--12
and 2013--17. Although the volume of China's arms exports to Pakistan
remained roughly the same in both periods, its share of Pakistan's arms
imports rose from 45 per cent in 2008--12 to 70 per cent in 2013--17 due
to the overall decrease in Pakistan's arms imports between those
periods," the report stated. China unhappy with US aircraft carrier's
visit to Vietnam, state media says The report also said China's arms
exports to Africa rose by 55 per cent over the period. Military expert
Collin Koh, from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at
Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said higher value
military items like warships and fighter jets were the major reason for
the rise in China's arms exports. "This is most notable in naval sales.
For example, submarines to Pakistan and Thailand, and corvettes to
Bangladesh and Algeria. Even with land-based systems, China has also
made inroads in higher value sales, such as its long-range rocket
artillery," he said.

#### Chinese arms sales support political and military competition with the US

\> Naval Combatants. China's naval warship sales have also surged since
2015, highlighted by Pakistan's purchase of eight YUAN variant
submarines for more than \$3 billion. Thailand also purchased one YUAN
variant submarine in 2017 and has expressed interest in purchasing two
more. To date, China has not delivered any YUAN variants, though it
delivered two MING-class submarines to Bangladesh in 2016. Also, in 2017
and 2018, China sold frigates to Bangladesh (two Type 053H3s) and
Pakistan (four Type 054As), and donated one unspecified frigate to Sri
Lanka. China's arms sales operate through state-run export organizations
such as AVIC and North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) that primarily
seek to generate profits. [[Arms transfers]{.mark} also [are a component
of China's foreign]{.mark} [policy]{.mark}, [used]{.mark} [in
conjunction with other types of military, economic]{.mark} aid, [and
development assistance]{.mark} [to support broader foreign policy
goals]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These include [securing]{.mark}
[access]{.mark} [to]{.mark} natural [resources]{.mark} [and export
markets, promoting]{.mark} [political influence]{.mark} among host
country elites, [and]{.mark} [building]{.mark} [support in international
forums]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many of China's arms recipients are
developing countries that tend to buy Chinese arms because they are less
expensive than comparable systems sold by other arms manufactures.
Although Chinese arms are considered by some potential customers to be
of lower quality and reliability, many Chinese systems are offered with
enticements such as gifts, donations, and flexible payment options. Some
Chinese systems include advanced capabilities. Chinese arms also tend to
carry fewer end-use restrictions and are monitored less rigorously than
competitors' arms exports, a factor that attracts customers with less
access to other sources of military equipment because of political or
economic reasons.

[[The economic, political and security strategy that the United States
has pursued for more than seven decades]{.mark}, under Democratic and
Republican administrations alike, is today widely questioned by large
segments of the American public and [is under
attack]{.mark}]{.underline} by leading political candidates in both
parties. [[Many Americans]{.underline}]{.mark} no longer seem to value
the liberal international order that the United States created after
World War II and sustained throughout the Cold War and beyond. Or
perhaps they [**[take it for granted and have lost sight of the
essential role the United States plays in supporting the international
environment from which they benefit greatly]{.mark}**. [The]{.mark}
unprecedented [prosperity made]{.mark} [possible by free and open
markets]{.mark} and thriving international trade; [the spread of
democracy]{.mark}; [and]{.mark} the [avoidance of major conflict among
great powers]{.mark}: All these remarkable accomplishments [have
depended on sustained U.S. engagement]{.mark} around the
world]{.underline}. Yet politicians in both parties' dangle before the
public the vision of an America freed from the burdens of leadership.
What these politicians don't say, perhaps because they don't understand
it themselves, is that the price of ending our engagement would far
outweigh its costs[. [The international order]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[created by the United States today faces challenges]{.mark} greater
than at any time since the height of the Cold War]{.underline}[. [Rising
authoritarian powers in Asia and Europe threaten to undermine the
security structures that have kept the peace since World War
II]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia invaded Ukraine and has seized some of
its territory. [[In East Asia, an increasingly aggressive China seeks to
control the sea lanes through which a large share of global commerce
flows]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the Middle East, Iran pursues hegemony by
supporting Hezbollah and Hamas and the bloody tyranny in Syria. The
Islamic State controls more territory than any terrorist group in
history, brutally imposing its extreme vision of Islam and striking at
targets throughout the Middle East, North Africa and Europe[. [None of
these threats will simply go away. Nor will the United States be spared
if the international order collapses]{.mark}, as it did twice in the
20th century. In the 21st century, oceans provide no security. Nor do
walls along borders. Nor would cutting off the United States from the
international economy by trashing trade agreements and erecting barriers
to commerce.]{.underline}

### Turns case: structural violence

#### China fill-in causes greater human rights abuses and corruption

Conventional Weapons: The Virtues of an Uncompetitive Market," *Ethics

Council for Ethics in International Affairs.

To show how [[market power]{.mark} can help [mitigate]{.mark} some of
[the worst aspects of the global arms]{.mark}
[trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, we can [consider the customer base of each
major weapons exporter]{.underline} [by its potential for defense
corruption and observance of human rights]{.underline}.16 Using
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute data on arms deliveries
from 2012 to 2016, Figure 2 splits each country\'s exports according to
whether the recipient scored a \"C\" or better in Transparency
International\'s (T I) Government Defence Anti-Corruption Index.17
Figure 2(a) presents the absolute level of exports for each category,
while 2(b) shows the two categories\' share of all exports. Before
moving on to specific countries, we can see that [the numbers
confirm]{.underline} many of [our worst fears about the arms
trade:]{.underline} [[most interstate MCW transfers go to coun- tries
with very high potential]{.mark}s [for defense
corruption]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In absolute terms, [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has]{.mark}
essentially [cornered the market for]{.mark} exports to
[countries]{.mark} [that are]{.mark} reasonably [transparent]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} their [acquisitions and security]{.mark} policy
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Russia and China]{.mark}, the second
and third largest exporters, [transfer weapons almost exclusively to
poor]{.mark}]{.underline}ly [[scoring countries]{.underline}]{.mark}.
France and the United Kingdom, the next largest, also sell a much higher
percentage to low-scoring regimes compared to the United States. Turning
to Figures 3 (a) and 3 (b), which divide importers by whether they score
a \"2\" or better on the Political Terror Index, we see similar
results.18 Clearly, arms purchases remain mired in a nontransparent
marketplace where the majority of weapons are imported by human rights
abusers. The export portfolios of Russia and China, as well as those of
France and the United Kingdom, rely heavily on countries with poor human
rights records.19 [[Efforts]{.mark} by European states [to increase
]{.mark}]{.underline}their [[exports]{.mark}, [coupled]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the Obama administration\'s relative
discretion in [[tying]{.mark} some [exports to good behavior by clients,
will]{.mark} likely [increase this divide]{.mark}]{.underline} in coming
years (even given the uncertain policy stances of the Trump
administration). The [divergences]{.underline} in Figures 2 and 3 [grow
larger when one examines]{.underline} the more futu[re-oriented data on
arms transfer agreements]{.underline} compiled by the U.S. Congressional
Research Service. Consider, for example, the financial value of
agreements with leading Near East arms importers--- countries with which
overall agreements increased by 36 percent between 2008---2011 and of
which have high levels of corruption and poor human rights records. 20
While the value of agreements between these coun- tries and the United
States has dropped by 37 percent across these two periods, export
agreements to the region by France, Germany, Italy, and the United
Kingdom have tripled from their 2008---2011 levels. Both Russia\'s share
and that of smaller European countries have climbed even faster, and are
approximately 4-5 times those of the previous period.

#### US global share decreasing now, but (1) highly competitive markets prevent total Chinese capture, and (2) lack of indigenous capacity hampers geopolitical impact of new clients

After a remarkably brief dip following the end of the cold war, [global
expenditure on weapons has risen steadily]{.underline}. [[While]{.mark}
much of the [focus]{.mark} [has rested on]{.mark} the efforts of
[China]{.mark},]{.underline} India, and Russia [to]{.underline} upgrade
their hardware and [expand their power-projection capa-
bilities,]{.underline} [[arms races appear to be accelerating]{.mark}
[among smaller]{.mark} [countries]{.mark} in Asia and the Middle
East]{.underline}. Overall, [the volume of international MCW transfers
grew by 8.4 percent between]{.underline} the five-year periods of
2007---[2011 and]{.underline} 2012---[2016]{.underline}.6 According to
the U.S. State Department, nearly 1 percent of all global trade is in
weapons.7 The increasingly sophisticated nature of these weapons creates
an important tension in their production. [Even as demand rises, the
development and construc- tion of high-end MCW are sufficiently
challenging that [few]{.mark} [countries]{.mark} and firms [can
produce]{.mark} them [indigenously]{.mark}]{.underline}. 8
[Consequently, [nearly]{.mark} [every]{.mark} [country]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} rising powers such as [China]{.mark}]{.underline} and
India, [[must import large portions of]{.mark} their [arse-
nals]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The [[few]{.mark}
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[have the ability to]{.mark}
manufacture and]{.underline} export weapons [[use this]{.mark} ability
[to advance]{.mark}]{.underline} a variety of
[[international]{.mark}]{.underline} and domestic [[political]{.mark}
[goals]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accordingly, [despite daunting barriers to
entry, [states as varied as Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey
desperately]{.mark} [seek to enter]{.mark} [this]{.mark} tantalizing
[market]{.mark}.]{.underline} Figure 1 gives a snapshot of three trends
in the global arms market using data from the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on weapons deliveries.9 [During the
cold war the global arms trade settled into a relatively duopolistic
market that reflected superpower politics]{.underline}, supplemented by
competi- tive exports from major European states backed by relatively
large amounts of domestic defense spending. Unsurprisingly, the gray
area in Figure 1 shows the bottom falling out of this market as global
defense spending retrenched following the cold war.
[However]{.underline}, [total global arms transfers have risen
steadily]{.underline} over the past decade. The dashed line in Figure 1
shows trends in the \"concentration ratio\" of sup- pliers to the market
by summing the market shares of the six traditionally largest sellers:
the United States, Russia (Soviet Union), France, Germany, Italy, and
Great Britain. Its consistently high value indicates that at the state
level, global arms transfers have always been highly oligopolistic.
[Competition does vary, however]{.underline}, [as the volume of
transfers rose]{.underline} during the cold war, [alternate suppliers
emerged.]{.underline} [Concentration, and thus the potential for
competition]{.underline}, stagnated after the cold war as purchases
dropped precipitously, but it [has grown]{.underline} again as arms
transfers have recovered more [recently]{.underline}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} global arms [[market]{.underline}]{.mark},
while still highly concentrated, [[has not been this competitive
since]{.mark} the end of [World War II]{.mark}.]{.underline} Finally,
the solid line shows that while [[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates remains the
global leader in the arms trade, its [[share]{.underline}]{.mark} as a
percentage of the market [[has]{.mark} [dropped to historically low
levels]{.mark}]{.underline}. At first glance, then, the [[rise in arms
transfers correlates to increased]{.underline}]{.mark} competition among
[[suppliers]{.underline}]{.mark}, more broadly, [[and]{.underline}
[lower]{.underline}]{.mark} [U[.S. market share]{.mark}]{.underline},
more specifically.

### Generic -- China dominance now

#### Chinese arms sales increasing now

**Aftergood**, Steven. "Rising China Sells More Weapons." Federation Of
American Scientists, 3 May 20**19**,
fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2019/05/china-weapons/.

"**[[In 2018, China's arms sales increased, continuing a trend that
enabled China to become the world's fastest-growing arms
supplier]{.mark} during the past 15 years]{.underline}**," according to
the 2019 China Military Power report published by the Department of
Defense. "**[From 2013 through 2017, China was the world's
fourth-largest arms supplier, [completing more than \$25 billion worth
of arms sales]{.mark}." "Arms transfers also are a component of China's
foreign policy, used in conjunction with other types of military,
economic aid, and development assistance to support broader foreign
policy goals," the Pentagon report said. "These include securing access
to natural resources and export markets, promoting political influence
among host country elites, and building support in international
forums]{.underline}**." Needless to say, the United States and other
countries have long done the same thing, using arms exports as an
instrument of foreign policy and political influence. Up to a point,
however, [[US arms sales are regulated by laws that include human rights
and other considerations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Generic -- Other countries fill in

#### Israel's arms sales are rising dramatically---they are likely to fill in

**Gross 18** Judah Ari Gross, The Times Of Israel May 2, 2018, 10,

year,\" Business Insider,
<https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-arms-sales-skyrocket-2018-5> gjb

[[Israeli arms sales increased dramatically --- by 41.5 percent --- from
2016 to 2017]{.mark}, according to new figures released by the Defense
Ministry on Wednesday, [including a massive missile defense system sale
to India]{.mark}.]{.underline} Defense exports brought in \$9.2 billion
last year, compared to the \$6.5 billion in 2016 and \$5.7 billion the
year before, according to the International Defense Cooperation
Directorate at the Defense Ministry, known as SIBAT. \"[[This is an
extraordinary achievemen]{.mark}t in every sense, which was reached
thanks to the hard work of SIBAT and the defense industries and due to a
number of agreements with foreign countries,\"]{.underline} Defense
Minister Avigdor Liberman said in a statement. This dramatic increase
can also be credited to efforts made by the Defense Ministry over the
past year to deregulate the arms industry and make it easier for Israeli
firms to export their wares. SIBAT chief Michel Ben-Baruch told
reporters he expects similar levels of defense exports in 2018. Asia
remained the biggest market for Israeli defense exports, accounting for
58% of arms sales in 2017. Europe and North America were Israel\'s next
largest customers. Africa, which saw a dramatic increase in arms sales
in 2016, amounted to just five percent of exports in 2017. [[Israel
significantly increased its sale of missiles --- including those used in
air defense --- in 2017. These exports jumped by over 70% from the year
before, amounting to nearly a third of all Israeli arms
sales.]{.mark}]{.underline} This can largely be credited to the \$630
million sale of Israel\'s Barak 8 missile defense system to India, but
Ben-Baruch stressed that \"it\'s not just the Barak 8, but several other
deals.\" [Radars and electronic warfare systems accounted for 17% of
arms sales. Cyber warfare products and drones --- two areas Israel for
which is perhaps best known --- amounted to just 5% and 2%,
respectively. Though]{.underline} [he would not provide a specific
breakdown, Ben-Baruch said the majority of Israel\'s defense exports
were from the larger contractors --- like Rafael, Israeli Aerospace
Industries and Israeli Military Industries --- and not from smaller
firms.]{.underline}

PARIS [-- [France's weapons export in 2018 were]{.underline}
]{.mark}[worth €9.1 billion (\$10.27 billion[), up 30 percent compared
to 201]{.mark}7, making last year "o[ne of the best figures of these
past 20 years,"]{.mark} according to Armed Forces Minister Florence
Parly. This figure keeps [France in the top three arms exporters
globally]{.mark} after the United States and Russia.]{.underline} Parly
explains in the foreword to a report prepared for the French parliament
that "this result is the consequence of the European twist we have given
to our export policy." In 2018, 25 percent of France's arms exports were
destined for its European partners against an average 10 percent in
previous years. **[The report notes that "[these results were obtained
in the context of particularly strong competition with the confirmation
of US supremacy and the emergence of new major exporters (notably
China]{.mark})."]{.underline}** The whole of the second chapter details
the procedures to grant export licenses and the nation's responsibility
as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, as a major arms
exporter and a nuclear power. The government has been heavily criticized
over the past months by both non-government organizations and political
opponents who say that some of the weapons sold to Saudi Arabia could be
used against civilians in the war in Yemen. But President Emmanuel
Macron said in early May that "there is a committee that manages these
exports, under the authority of the prime minister, where, in fact,
things have been toughened these past few years and where we demand
guarantees that these weapons cannot be used against civilians. This
\[guarantee\] has been obtained." France's five major clients of 2018
were Qatar (\$2.7 billion) including Rafale fighter jets and 28 NH-90
helicopters, Belgium (\$1.27 billion) for 382 Griffon and 60 Jaguar
armored vehicles, Saudi Arabia (\$1 billion) including patrol vessels,
and Spain (\$658 million) for 23 NH-90 helicopters. The other major
clients for France in 2018 were India (\$462 million) and Thailand
(\$363 million), followed by Egypt (\$324 million), Argentina (\$307
million), Kuwait (\$300 million), United Arab Emirates (\$216 million),
Uzbekistan (\$214 million), the United States (\$178 million), Italy
(\$130 million), Indonesia (\$129 million) and the United Kingdom (\$126
million). [However, if one takes into account all the smaller contracts
signed with other European Union member states, sales to Europe
accounted for a total of nearly \$2.6 billion, up from \$579 million in
2017, in second place behind sales to the Near and Middle East, which
totaled \$5.5 billion, up from \$4.4 billion in 2017]{.underline}.

**[[The UK nearly doubled the value of arms sales to countries on the
government's list of human rights abusers in the past
year,]{.mark}]{.underline}** figures reveal. Licences for arms deals
worth some £1.5bn were approved in Whitehall in 2017, up from £820m a
year earlier, according to figures compiled by the Campaign Against the
Arms Trade (CAAT) pressure group. [**[Sales were granted to 18 countries
on the list, including China, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Israel, Egypt and
Pakistan]{.mark}**, compared to 20 different states in
2016]{.underline}. The value of sales to Saudi Arabia, currently
embroiled in a bloody conflict in Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi
rebels where thousands of civilians have been killed and millions left
in need of aid, alone totalled £1.13bn, the group said. Theresa May's
government is "actively arming and supporting many of the regimes that
even it believes are responsible for terrible human rights abuses",
CAAT's Andrew Smith told The Independent. He added: "There is little
oversight in the system, and no controls over how these arms will be
used once they have left the UK**[. T[he arms sales being agreed today
could be used to fuel atrocities for years to come. Right now UK-made
fighter jets and bombs are playing a central role in the Saudi-led
destruction of Yemen]{.mark}, and the government and arms companies have
totally failed to monitor or evaluate how this deadly equipment is being
used.]{.underline}** "We are always being told how rigorous and robust
the system supposedly is, but nothing could be further from the truth.
These arms sales don't just provide dictatorships and human rights
abusers with the means to kill, they also give them a huge degree of
political support." [[Israel was the second-biggest buyer of UK arms in
2017 to feature on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) human
rights priority list,]{.underline}]{.mark} with £221m of licences
granted. In its watch list covering 2017, published this week, the FCO
condemned Israel's breaches of international law by its ongoing
occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza and also "its
systematic policy of settlement expansion". **[[Rights abuses were also
committed by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[it said, including 19 death sentences passed and six carried out by
the former]{.underline}**. Bahrain bought £30.7m of British arms in
2017, Egypt imported £6.5m of arms and Pakistan, £11.2m. Sales to China,
which is cracking down further on freedom of speech and religion,
totalled £11.8m. In recent months, reports have emerged of Chinese
authorities detaining Muslims for re-education. Some claim they have
been forced to disavow their beliefs and praise the Communist Party
daily while being held without access to a lawyer. "Thousands of
\[Uyghur Muslims\] were held in re-education camps after returning from
abroad" in 2017, the FCO said. In Bangladesh, which bought £38.6m of
arms, there were continued "credible reports of enforced disappearances,
extrajudicial killings and torture by government agencies", the FCO
said, though it noted that the Bangladeshi government had taken in more
than 688,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar following ethnic cleansing
and religious persecution there. A Department for International Trade
(DIT) spokeswoman said: "The UK operates one of the most robust export
control regimes in the world. We rigorously examine every application on
a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms
Export Licensing Criteria. We will not grant a licence if doing so would
be inconsistent with these criteria. "As we leave the European Union,
the government will maintain the integrity and effectiveness of our
existing export licensing system." [CAAT's figures came as Parliament's
Committees on Arms Export Controls (CAEC) made a number of
recommendations for beefing up the UK's arms export regime. MPs said
they were "not convinced" HM Revenue and Customs had sufficient
resources to run its export control enforcement regime and that
ministers should tighten restrictions on sales to countries accused of
rights abuses.]{.underline} The default position should be to block the
sale of weapons to states that have not signed an international arms
trade treaty, and those on the FCO's blacklist. The DIT spokeswoman
added: "We will consider the report's recommendations carefully and will
respond in due course."

### Drones

#### Chinese drones sales remain higher than the United States 

Lu, **[Zhenhua]{.underline}**. "China Is World\'s Biggest Exporter of
Armed Drones, Says Report." *South China Morning Post*, 11 Mar.
20**19**,
[www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2189604/china-sells-weapons-more-countries-and-biggest-exporter-armed](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2189604/china-sells-weapons-more-countries-and-biggest-exporter-armed).

**[[China is]{.mark} selling arms to more countries and
is]{.underline}** now **[[the world's leading exporter of armed
drones]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to a report released by the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday. But
the latest data from the Swedish think tank shows Chinese arms exports
increased by a relatively low 2.7 per cent in the period from 2014 to
2018, compared to the previous five years. Weapons exports from the
United States, however, jumped 29 per cent in the 2014-18 period from
2009-13. Meanwhile**[, [China expanded its customer base to 53
countries]{.mark} in 2014-18, up [from 41]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the
previous five years. **[The researchers also found that [China is the
world leader in sales of armed drones]{.mark}, or unmanned combat aerial
vehicles -- [supplying 153 of them to 13 countries in the past five
years. By contrast, the US]{.mark} -- the world's biggest arms exporter
-- [only sold five armed drones, to Britain, over]{.mark} the [10
years]{.mark}]{.underline}** from 2009. The main buyers of the Chinese
drones are Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Nan Tian, a researcher with
SIPRI's arms transfers and military expenditure programme, said China's
military technology advances -- with more emphasis on developing its own
weapons -- were a key reason for the slower growth in arms exports,
along with its defence budget. "Previously, China relied on foreign
countries such as Russia, Ukraine and France in developing its own
armament industry," Nan said. "Now, it has increasingly turned to
domestic manufacturers such as AVIC and Norinco in arms exports." He
added that armed drones had been "one of the most visible technological
developments" made by Chinese arms producers. As export growth has
slowed, China's military spending has been increasing at a more modest
pace. Last week, Beijing said the defence budget would rise 7.5 per cent
for 2019, the fourth consecutive year of single-digit spending growth
for the People's Liberation Army. SIPRI, which monitors the
international arms trade, said the slower growth in China's weapons
exports in recent years contrasted sharply with the 195 per cent rise in
arms sales in the 2009-13 period, from the previous five years.
Pakistan, China's key ally in South Asia, remained Beijing's top arms
buyer in the last five years -- a position it has maintained since 1991
-- followed by Bangladesh and Algeria. The US, Russia, France, Germany
and China are the world's top five arms exporters, accounting for three
quarters of the total volume of weapons sales from 2014 to 2018.

#### China will overtake the US in arms sales

**Farley**, Robert. "Can China Replace the United States as the World\'s
Top Arms Dealer?" *The Diplomat*, The Diplomat, 21 Nov. **2017**,
thediplomat.com/2017/11/can-china-replace-the-us-as-the-worlds-top-arms-dealer/.

[In his recent tour of East Asia, **[Donald Trump made a point of
touting U.S. arms sales, which bring cash to the United States and jobs
to American workers]{.mark}**. Trump's point is straightforward, if not
often acknowledged in U.S. policy circles: arms sales not only extend
U.S. influence, but also benefit the United States economically. The
United States has enjoyed a dominant global position in arms transfers
since at least the early 1990s]{.underline}, despite export restrictions
that occasionally restrict transfers for political and technological
reasons. [**[U.S. market position depends on two factors; the
technological superiority of U.S. equipment, and the political value in
establishing a defense relationship with the United States.
Historically, China arms export strategy has been built around
exploiting the edges of these U.S. advantages. First, China sells
military equipment at much lower prices that the United States, which
for some types of equipment (and some sellers) is ideal. Second, China
will sell to just about any customer.]{.mark}** But it may not be too
long before the United States needs to worry about competition directly
in its niche. China is taking steps to modernize the relationship
between its defense industrial base and its technology sector, with the
hope of generating investment in firms that work at the juncture between
the latter and the former.]{.underline} Leveraging the relationship
between civilian and military technology is how the United State
achieved military superiority over the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
It's also been a preoccupation of advocates of the "Third Offset," which
hopes to further harness the U.S. tech sector in the service of
maintaining American superiority in military technology. And [**[there
are indications that the Chinese are ever-more-ready to challenge the
United States in this arena.]{.mark}** The Chinese defense industry
remains far more autarkic than the United States', and is still largely
state controlled. But allowing heavy civilian investment into
military-related civilian industries, as well as focusing on building
linkages between civilian industries and the military, could accelerate
Chinese innovation. If China can successfully connect its burgeoning
tech industry with its defense industrial base (a project that even the
United States has struggled with), then it can accomplish something that
the Soviet Union utterly failed at.]{.underline} Obviously, many
obstacles remain, some of which the United States also faces. The task
of integrating China's state-owned defense giants with its private
sector tech companies will be enormously complicated, with many
potential pitfalls. Not the least of these is convincing Chinese tech
firms that their technologies are safe in the hands of state-owned
defense giants, a task that is probably even more difficult than getting
U.S. tech firms to work with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. The eventual
outcome might look something like the European model, where large,
state-controlled defense firms have a tolerably good relationship with
the civilian sector. The difference would be that, as in the United
States, the defense industrial base can count on huge, consistent
government outlays. **[[If China can square the circle, it can compete
with the United States not only on the air and at sea, but also in the
international arms market. Chinese arms in the hands of traditional U.S.
export partners may not be quite as dangerous as those in Chinese hands,
but they have the potential to undercut a dominant U.S. market
position.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Africa

#### Chinese sales to Africa remain higher than America's

**[CSIS 18]{.underline}** - Center for Strategic International Studies -
China Power 2018. 6-29-18
<https://chinapower.csis.org/china-global-arms-trade/> - ChinaPower
provides an in-depth understanding of the evolving nature of Chinese
power relative to other countries. The project examines five
interrelated categories of Chinese power: military, economics,
technology, social, and international image -

That said[, **[Chinese weaponry is becoming increasingly attractive due
in part to its cost-effectiveness]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[. Although
Chinese arms are often less advanced than those sold by other countries,
the DOD notes that "[Chinese arms are less expensive than those offered
by the top international arms suppliers... \[but still\] have advanced
capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}**" For example[, **[the low-cost K-8
jet trainer is estimated to make up 80 percent of all jet trainer
aircraft in Africa. China is actively working to strengthen its foothold
in certain markets]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, such as Algeria. China's
exports to the North African country totaled \$483 million between 2008
and 2014, but jumped to \$247 million in 2015 alone and peaked at \$499
million in 2016 as several weapon orders were fulfilled]{.underline}**.
These procurements included three C-28A frigates, which were ordered by
Algeria in 2012. Although not a member of the Missile Technology Control
Regime, a non-proliferation agreement targeted at missiles and systems
capable of delivery weapons of mass destruction, Beijing is generally
compliant with international protocols. The 2002 Regulations on the
Export Control of Missiles and Missile-related Items and Technologies,
for instance, outlines measures to safeguard against proliferation. In
June 2017, China published a draft of the Export Control Law, which if
enacted will update existing legislation and establish a comprehensive
export control regime.

### Middle East

#### Arms sales to Middle East decreasing now

**Weisgerber**, Marcus. "Pentagon\'s Focus On China and Russia Expected
to Alter US Arms Sales." *Defense One*, 4 Apr. **2019**,
www.defenseone.com/business/2019/04/pentagons-focus-china-and-russia-expected-alter-us-arms-sales/156079/.

As the U.S. military shifts its focus to Russia and China, American arms
exports are expected to make a similar shift to allies in Europe and
Asia, experts say. **[[Arms export data already shows a shift away from
the Middle]{.mark} [East]{.mark}, where Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and UAE have been scooping up American weapons.]{.underline}** "I
would imagine that this year and next we would see an uptick in sales to
Asia, but it hasn't shown up yet," William Hartung, director of the Arms
Security Project at the Center for International Policy, said Thursday.
**[[The total value of arms-export deals approved by the Trump
administration declined from \$82.2 billion]{.mark} in 2017 [to \$78.8
billion]{.mark} last year,]{.underline}** according to a new report by
Hartung and Christina Arabia, director of the Security Assistance
Monitor**[. Also declining from 2017 to 2018: [the share of deals with
countries in the Middle East]{.mark} and Northern Africa, two regions of
intense focus in the past two decades of counterinsurgency- dominated
wars. "Deals with countries in the Middle East and North Africa [dropped
from 36.6% to 21.9%,"]{.mark} the report states. "And offers to East
Asia and the Pacific dropped from 23.6% to 14.3%."]{.underline}**

### Saudi

#### Fill-in happening now -- drone factory proves

Minnie **Chan** 26 Mar, 20**17**, \"Chinese drone factory in Saudi
Arabia first in Middle East,\" South China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2081869/chinese-drone-factory-saudi-arabia-first-middle-east

[[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}'s]{.mark} key science and technology
organisation has [[confirmed]{.mark} that [one of the deals sealed
during]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[Saudi]{.underline} [[King
Salman's]{.mark} [visit to China]{.mark}]{.underline} this month
[[was]{.mark} an agreement [to set up the]{.mark} [first]{.mark}
[factory]{.mark} [for Chinese]{.mark} hunter-killer aerial
[drones]{.mark} [in the Middle East]{.mark}.]{.underline} IHS Jane's
Defence Weekly reported on Thursday that the King Abdulaziz City for
Science and Technology (KACST) had signed a partnership agreement on
March 16 with China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC),
which makes China's CH-4 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV[), [a model with
similar capabilities to the Ameri]{.mark}can Air Force's MQ-1
[Predator]{.mark}.]{.underline} China and Saudi Arabia signed US\$65
billion worth of deals in ­energy, culture, education and technology
during the king's visit in the middle of this month. A Chinese military
website and military experts said Saudi Technology Development and
Investment Company (TAQNIA) had signed a protocol with China's Aerospace
Long-March International Trade (ALIT) for the drone production line at
the biennial International Defence Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) in
Abu Dhabi in February. TAQNIA is a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public
Investment Fund, while ALIT is a Chinese export-import company that
specialises in aerospace technologies. Zhou Chenming, who previously
worked for CASC's drone-development subsidiary, said [the CH-4 factory
in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, only the third in the world outside China,
following ones in Pakistan and Myanmar, [would]{.underline} also
[assemble associated equipment, which would improve after-sales services
for clients in the Middle East]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} drone [deal
would]{.mark} help [satisfy Saudi Arabia's desire for more CH-4
drones]{.mark}]{.underline}, he said. The CH-4 has reconnaissance and
combat functions and CASC has promoted the drone's counter-terrorism
capabilities when marketing it in the Middle East and North Africa. [The
drone, [already being used by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan and some
other countries]{.mark}, fires AR-1 missiles that can hit a distant
target with a margin of error of less than 1.5 metres.]{.underline} A
report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI) in February said Iraq had imported 56 per cent of its arms from
the United States over the past five years. However, [[Iraq]{.mark}'s
defence ministry said]{.underline} in a report [it had [opted for the
CH-4 over the]{.mark} US [Predator]{.mark} [because it was
cheaper]{.mark}.]{.underline} A CH-4 drone costs US\$4 million, while
the US Air Force website says a package including four MQ-1 Predators
and a ground control station costs US\$20 million. The SIPRI report
showed that arms imports by states in the Middle East had risen 86 per
cent in the past five years and accounted for 29 per cent of global
imports, with Saudi Arabia being the world's second-largest arms
importer after India. Macau-based miliary observer Antony Wong Dong said
the CH-4 drone project was probably offered as a substitute deal after
one for China's DF-21D "carrier killer" ballistic missile, which Saudi
Arabia wanted to buy in 2014, fell through. "The DF-21 deal was turned
down as a result of strong opposition in the international community
amid the Iran nuclear crisis in the region \... Beijing may want to use
the CH-4 drone as a substitute project in a bid to please an old
friend," Wong said. "Because the Chinese-made DF-3 missile that Saudi
Arabia bought from Beijing nearly three decades ago is due for
decommissioning, China should give weapons as a replacement." Beijing
sold more than three dozen of its then-advanced, nuclear-capable,
intermediate-range DF-3A ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 at a
cost of US\$3.5 billion -- an amount more than half China's defence
budget that year. The deal also caused the oil-rich kingdom to cut-off
diplomatic ties with self-ruled Taiwan and formally recognise Beijing in
1990. Zhou said China had exported the Wing Long, a medium-altitude,
long-endurance UAV, to Saudi Arabia in 2014, but that drone had not
performed well in the Arabian desert. "The CH-4 has recorded outstanding
performance in anti-terrorist attacks in Iraq, Yemen, as well as in
Africa's Sudan, Ethiopia and China's neighbouring Pakistan," he said.
"That's why our Saudi friends are so interested in the drone cooperation
project." Professor Jonathan Holslag, head of research at the Brussels
Institute of Contemporary China Studies, said low oil prices had led to
some oil-exporting countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq, using
cheaper Chinese weapons. "Like so many regional powers, Saudi Arabia is
hedging its bets," he said. "While military cooperation with the US
remains very important, the Saudi government actively diversifies its
security cooperation, so as to maximise its flexibility in responding to
threats. "[[The global defence market is reflecting the increasingly
fragmented world order]{.mark}."]{.underline} Holslag said the US
remained dominant in military hardware sales but former US president
Barack [Obama's reluctance to intervene in the Middle East and the
election of his isolationist successor Donald Trump had led many
countries in the region to question America's reliability as an arms
exporter.]{.underline} Zhou said the drone factory deal was just "small
business" in the US\$65 billion of deals signed during the king's visit.
"The real aims behind the deals are an oil-hungry China being able to
get more oil from the kingdom to sustain its domestic economic
development, and Saudi Arabia improving its infrastructure with China's
technological aid." When President Xi Jinping visited Riyadh in January
last year the two countries promised to form a comprehensive strategic
partnership and boost industrial cooperation in line with Beijing's "One
Belt, One Road" trade and infrastructure scheme.

[**[Saudi Arabia signed US\$28 billion worth of economic cooperation
agreements with China]{.mark}** on Friday as its crown prince, Mohammed
bin Salman, met top Chinese leaders in Beijing. **"[China is a good
friend and partner to Saudi Arabia,"]{.mark}** [Chinese President Xi
Jinping told Salman at the Great Hall of People.]{.mark}]{.underline}
"The special nature of our bilateral relationship reflects the efforts
you have made." The crown prince also said Saudi Arabia supported
China's "Belt and Road Initiative" and respected Beijing's
counterterrorism efforts. "The Silk Road initiative and China's
strategic orientation are very much in line with the kingdom's Vision
2030," state news agency Saudi Press Agency quoted Salman as saying,
referring to Saudi Arabia's economic reform programme. [**[Trade between
China and Saudi Arabia rose by 32 per cent last year,]{.mark}** he said.
[According to SPA, **35 economic cooperation agreements were signed at a
joint investment forum held by Saudi Arabia's investment agency during
the visit.**]{.mark} Among them was a deal between Aramco and Chinese
defence conglomerate Norinco to develop a US\$10 billion refining and
petrochemical complex in the northeastern Chinese city of
Panjin.]{.underline} Aramco said that as part of the project the
partners would form a company called Huajin Aramco Petrochemical to
build a refinery that could produce 300,000 barrels of oil per day.
Salman and his delegation arrived on Thursday for a two-day trip after
visiting India and Pakistan. The group also met Vice-Premier Han Zheng
and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing. In his meeting with the crown
prince on Friday, Han said the two countries should work together on
counterterrorism, law enforcement, security and deradicalization,
according to state news agency Xinhua. A day earlier, Wang told Saudi
Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir that China supported Saudi Arabia's
efforts to diversify its economy and was willing to strengthen hi-tech
cooperation. "All countries in the world have the right to develop, and
Saudi Arabia is an emerging market country with enormous potential,"
Wang said. Xi has made stepping up China's presence in the Middle East a
key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role
there. But China has had to step carefully in relations with Riyadh,
since Beijing also has close ties with Saudi Arabia's regional foe Iran.
Earlier in the week, top Chinese leaders including Xi and Wang also
received an Iranian delegation headed by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad
Zarif in Beijing. According to Xinhua, Wang told Zarif that China wanted
to "deepen strategic trust" with Tehran. Li Weijian, a Middle East
expert at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said
China's policy in the Middle East was not to side with any party.
"Simultaneously hosting Iran and Saudi delegations within a week has
sent out the exact message that China has no interest in siding \[with
one country or the other\]," Li said. He said that approach could enable
China to mediate between the two countries if necessary.

U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/trumps-trade-war-threatens-chinese-economy-china-already-has-cracks.html)

but this diplomatic crisis could spur its acceleration, according to
Saman Vakil, a research fellow at U.K. think tank Chatham House and a
professor at Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies.
"In Riyadh, diversification of relationships and not putting all their
eggs in Washington's basket has been a longstanding policy," Vakil told
CNBC, describing energy deals with China dating back to the 1990s. "And
it could be in their continued interest, because if there are
forthcoming sanctions from the EU or the U.S. on human rights issues,
obviously China's policy of non-interference would make sense for them,
strategically speaking." Still, [the nearly 90-year-old alliance ---
deemed a "special relationship" when diplomatic ties were first
established in 1933 --- remains paramount to the kingdom's stability,
something Riyadh knows very well. "**[A break with the U.S., any obvious

China may continue to engage more with Saudi Arabia if Washington
imposes sanctions over the disappearance and presumed murder of Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but it cannot supplant US arms sales as
President Donald Trump believes, analysts say. US Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as Washington weighs
actions against Riyadh over the fate of Khashoggi, a US resident and
vocal critic of the Saudi regime who vanished two weeks ago. But Trump
has been reluctant to support sanctions, citing the impact to a US\$110
billion arms deal he helped broker last year. "I don't like the concept
of stopping an investment of US\$110 billion into the United States
because you know what they're going to do?" Trump told reporters last
week. "They're going to take that money and spend it in Russia or China
or someplace else." [Saudi Arabia has long sought to diversify away from
its reliance on the US and has increasingly stepped up its engagement
with China, its largest trading partner with US\$42.36 billion in
bilateral trade in 2017. Last March, the two countries also signed
US\$65 billion worth of deals in areas ranging from energy to space
technology.]{.underline} The Arab nation could turn to countries such as
China and Russia to help fulfil its military needs if US sanctions were
imposed, a step that would "create an economic disaster that would rock
the entire world", according to a widely cited opinion piece by the
general manager of the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel. In the
editorial, Turki Aldakhil said Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest oil
exporter -- was considering more than 30 countermeasures to be taken
against the US, including trading oil in yuan instead of the US dollar.
**[But [in the military realm, China's arms exports to Saudi Arabia lag
far behind those of the US and its European allies]{.mark}. Beijing
exported only around US\$20 million in arms last year compared to
US\$3.4 billion from Washington, according to data from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, a Swedish think
tank.]{.underline}** Jonathan Fulton, assistant professor of political
science at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, said China had grown more
serious in its regional arms relationships with Gulf states in recent
years, with the potential to serve as a "wedge" as US-Saudi relations
frayed. Along with Riyadh's previous indications that it was willing to
consider funding in yuan, increased arms sales would be a "natural
progression" of their relationship, he said. ["Part of the reason why
\[Saudi Arabia\] is diversifying is there's been so many kinds of
structural changes in the relationship with the US," Fulton said.
"Another important part is just obviously the commercial relationship
and economic relationship between these Gulf states and China, with
these energy exports. We're seeing a lot more engagement both
ways."]{.underline} But as evidence piles up that Saudi Arabia ordered
Khashoggi's assassination, which the government denies, the backlash is
getting louder. A bipartisan group of US senators have pressured Trump
to enact sanctions and key corporate sponsors have pulled out of the
high-profile "Davos in the Desert" investment forum to be held in Riyadh
this month. "I would expect to see some kind of ... Saudi-led way to
ease the tensions between the US and Riyadh because I don't think they
can afford to let the US relationship deteriorate," Fulton said. Simone
van Nieuwenhuizen, an Australia-based researcher of China-Middle East
relations at the University of Technology Sydney, [said [China would be
"extremely unlikely" to follow US sanctions if they were levelled
against Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, but may not necessarily increase trade
with the country either.]{.underline} "I think China is likely to keep a
low profile on this issue and see how it plays out before directly
addressing it," she said. "[While its technology is developing, [China
still lags behind the US in the sophistication and capability of its
military equipment. It simply can't fill the gap."]{.mark}]{.underline}
Saudis still denying journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder despite reports
he recorded torture and death Robert Mason, director of the Middle East
Studies Centre at the American University in Cairo, said **[[China would
not want to get involved at this stage to avoid further tensions with
the Trump administration.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "I'm sure China will be
interested to expand relations if and when US-Saudi ties deteriorate.
However, Saudi policy looks set to shift to admitting to the accidental
killing of Jamal Khashoggi inside its consulate in Istanbul, and I'm
sure they will try to de-escalate during Secretary Pompeo's visit," he
said. "It is unlikely the US will change a decades-old policy favouring
close economic and security ties with the Kingdom, including
considerable counterterrorism cooperation and the containment of Iran,
over this one incident." Sun Degang, a Middle East expert at Shanghai
International Studies University, said that if the US and Saudi Arabia
were to part ways, it would be possible for China to develop deeper
economies ties with the Arab nation, including using the yuan to trade
oil. "But from what we see now, US-Saudi tensions have remained at a
diplomatic level and haven't deteriorated at a fundamental level," he
said.

### Drones -- A2 Link UQ

#### Uniqueness overwhelms the link -- China has already filled in and there is nothing we can do to get back into those markets.

Sharon **Weinberger**, 20**18**, 5-10-18, Carnegie/Newhouse School Legal
Reporting Fellow, "China has Already Won in the Drone Wars"
\[https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/\]

The drone on display was, in fact, a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) called the Rainbow CH-4, which has quickly spread around the
world. Jordan bought the drone in 2015 but displayed it publicly for the
first time this year at the Special Operations Forces Exhibition and
Conference, known as SOFEX, a biennial event where companies market
their latest wares. **[[Once upon a time, the sight would have been
unthinkable: The MQ-1 Predator and its successor, the more lethal MQ-9
Reaper, were for more than a decade synonymous with armed drones. But
that now is changing, not because Beijing has built a better drone but
because it has been willing to sell them to countries where the United
States wouldn't.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For years, advocates of **[[U.S.
arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}** bemoaned tight export **[[restrictions
on armed drones]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has allowed China to move
in on a lucrative market while depriving American companies of valuable
business. Jordan had originally requested to buy the Reaper, made by San
Diego-based General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, but was turned down.
When Beijing subsequently secured the deal, Republican Rep. Duncan
Hunter [lamented](https://cdn.defenseone.com/b/defenseone/interstitial.html?v=8.12.0&rf=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.defenseone.com%2Fideas%2F2015%2F12%2Fwhy-obama-letting-china-beat-us-global-drone-sales%2F124213%2F) in
late 2015 that "China is seizing the opportunity." More than two years
later, China's growing share of the armed drone market is on display. To
date, only the United Kingdom, France, and Italy have bought an armed
version of the MQ-9 Reaper, while other U.S. allies, including Jordan,
are flying Chinese drones, such as the CH-4. The United States now
belatedly is trying to recapture the armed drone market. For years, U.S.
companies were restricted from such sales, in part as a result of the
Missile Technology Control Regime, an international pact that aims to
curb the export of certain long-range cruise missiles and drones. (China
is not a signatory to the agreement.) But last month, the Trump
administration, as part of its "Buy American" push, announced a new
policy intended to loosen export restrictions on armed drones. In
announcing the changes, Peter Navarro, President Donald Trump's trade
advisor, blasted "Chinese replicas" of American drones "deployed on the
runways in the Middle East." Overly restrictive policies had put the
United States in danger of losing out on an estimated \$50 billion
international market for drones, according to Navarro**[[. "The
administration's \[unmanned aerial systems\] export policy will level
the playing field by enabling U.S. firms to increase direct sales to
authorized allies and partners,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[he said. But
the new export policy doesn't appear to have made any immediate
impact.]{.underline}]{.mark}** General Atomics Aeronautical Systems,
which makes the Reaper, had a modest exhibit at SOFEX and was
advertising only unarmed versions of its aircraft. "We're still in the
process of evaluating the recent Export Policy announcement and its
impact on potential sales," a spokesperson for the company wrote in
response to a question about potential sales. "At this point, it's too
soon to comment." And though SOFEX featured an entire pavilion for U.S.
companies selling weapons, none, other than General Atomics Aeronautical
Systems, appeared to be offering drones, let alone armed drones. Even
U.S. officials say it's unclear how the new drone regulations will be
implemented. "I don't know the answer --- that's relatively new --- and
I don't even have the talking points on how we're supposed to respond to
that," says Dave Dornblaser, the director of the Washington field office
for U.S. Army Security Assistance Command, when asked at SOFEX about the
new regulations. "I can tell you there is quite a bit of interest in
UAVs[. ["Even with the Trump administration reforms, it may ultimately
be too late to capture an export market dominated by
China]{.underline},]{.mark} as well as Israel. [["The Chinese have made
a lot of inroads]{.mark}]{.underline} into the market, and U.S. export
policy has definitely helped them, because the U.S. has stayed out of a
lot of potential markets," says Philip Finnegan, the director of
corporate analysis at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. "While some areas
might be filled by Israeli manufacturers who are very active, the Middle
East is one where the Israelis aren't active for obvious reasons. And so
the Chinese have filled the void." "While some areas might be filled by
Israeli manufacturers who are very active, the Middle East is one where
the Israelis aren't active for obvious reasons. And so the Chinese have
filled the void." The CH-4, whose resemblance to the iconic Predator is
no accident, follows a long tradition of Chinese technology
manufacturing, whether in cars or smartphones: Make it look like a
name-brand Western equivalent, but build it cheaper and good enough to
get the job done. (Amusingly, a video at the show advertising the CH-4
called it "one of the best" UAVs in the world, as in, not the best.)
Analysts have
even [suggested](http://www.atimes.com/chinas-armed-drones-appear-built-from-stolen-data-from-us-cyber-intrusions/),
albeit without proof, that China pilfered U.S. technical information for
its drone program. China's sales have been buoyed by developing
countries looking to fight insurgencies, and one of the factors driving
recent buys, including Iraq's, has been the war on the Islamic State,
which has also proved an advertising boon to the Chinese. At the exhibit
area for China's Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co., the maker
of the CH-4, a video promoting the company's drones featured extensive
footage released by the Iraqi military showing strikes on Islamic State
fighters. The Iraq military has already conducted at least 260 strikes
against Islamic State militants using the CH-4, with close to 100
percent accuracy, according to a [Chinese-language
article](http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/jssd/2018-02-17/doc-ifyrrmye2266090.shtml).
(A Jordanian military officer told Foreign Policy that his country's
CH-4s, which are armed with Chinese AR-1 anti-tank missiles, similar to
the American Hellfire, have not fired weapons in combat yet.) Since
China doesn't disclose all of its international customers, it's hard to
know the full extent of its sales, but a video on display at the exhibit
acknowledged Algeria, Nigeria, Jordan, Zambia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
Ethiopia, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and Myanmar as customers. Notably
absent from that list is the United Arab Emirates, which reportedly
received its first CH-4 last
year. FP [reported](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/) last
month that the UAE used its Chinese drone to assassinate a Houthi leader
in Yemen. While the Americans are just now moving forward with selling
armed drones, China has been going full steam ahead. The CH-4 --- a
medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV --- is part of series of Rainbow
drones produced by Aerospace Long-March International. While the CH-4
physically resembles the American Reaper, it is not as capable. It does
not, for example, have a satellite link, which means it must be operated
within line of sight, which limits its range and battlefield utility.
China's newest drone, the CH-5, will have a satellite link. Aerospace
Long-March International was also marketing smaller drones at SOFEX,
including its CH-901, a minidrone that the company calls a "suicide
UAV." While eager to sell its products, the company is also wary of
scrutiny. Company representatives at the show declined to speak to a
reporter and refused to give business cards to another visitor, an
American who introduced himself as a "policy advisor." Another Chinese
company, called Shenzhen Precision Technology Co., based in Shenzhen
City, was at SOFEX advertising its small combat drone that can shoot
grenades. The 35-kilogram vertical takeoff and landing drone can stay
aloft for 20 minutes and has a range of 8 kilometers. Xue Kun, the
company's executive director, says it took him four years to design the
drone, which he's selling, along with the ground station, for \$300,000
each. He calls the concept an "air force in a truck," because three can
be loaded into a specially designed carrying case attached to a vehicle.
"If you buy many, you can get a discount," he says. "I can also produce
them locally, in your country." He hasn't sold any of his combat drones
abroad yet --- he says they are used now only by Chinese police --- but
he hopes his attendance at SOFEX, his first opportunity to display a
mock-up of the drone at an international arms exhibition, would help
drum up sales. Operating Chinese drones rather than American ones offers
both economic and political advantages for some countries. The Chinese
drones are much cheaper --- typically a quarter of the price of similar
American systems. China also is less likely to dictate how other
countries use them, whereas U.S. exports can come with restrictions. The
problem with allowing allies to buy Chinese drones is not just
financial. As Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow at the U.K.-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies, points out, when foreign
countries buy American weapons, the U.S. government has the ability to
exercise some control over how that technology is used. "It's a
balancing act, and it's very difficult to get right," he says of U.S.
export law. The Chinese approach to selling weapons, he says, is much
more "transactional." Now that the export restrictions are being
loosened, the United States does have the ability to compete for more
international sales, but the problem is that [[many countries have
already found what they need in Chinese drones]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Now, Barrie says, those countries might simply ask themselves: ''Is the
requirement fulfilled? This Chinese stuff is quite good." And then, even
when they buy more drones, those countries may simply stick with China.
[["Once you open the door,"]{.underline}]{.mark} Barrie says, [["there's
no guarantee you can close it."]{.underline}]{.mark}

result, said Sekora, it has little influence over who gets to buy and

administration and the FAA, which recently broke out a spate of new
drone policies to make it easier for U.S. companies to build, test,
license, fly and sell drones here and abroad. But policies such as the
FAA's Unmanned Aerial Systems Pilot Program, which it unveiled last
month with the tagline, "[Make aviation great again," won't win back
American drone dominance]{.underline} nor keep American enemies from

[To the untrained eye [the two drones]{.mark} may [look]{.mark} a hell
of [a lot alike]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} we hear from experts who cannot be

best superficial]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our experts work on black drone
programs and can't speak on the record. The Caihong 5 has both a radome
nose and an upward pointing V-tail like the Reaper, and its 66 foot
wingspan is exactly the same as the American drone. According to Chinese
media, the Caihong 5's maximum gross takeoff weight is about 6,000 lbs.,
well below the Reaper's 10,500 lbs., and Beijing's Reaper knockoff has a
reported maximum payload of 900 kilograms (1,984 lbs.), far less than
the MQ-9's combined payload of 3,000 lbs. external and 850 lbs.
internal. The Reaper's combined payload is about 1,749 kilos, nearly
double the Caihong 5's. [But that tale of the tape is just as
superficial as the Caihong 5's resemblance to the Reaper. The Caihong
5's manufacturer, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation,
told Chinese media their drone can carry six missiles and stay airborne
30 hours, which is significantly more than the Reaper's usual endurance
of 18 to 27 hours, depending on what it carries]{.underline}. Chief
designer Ou Zhongming said the Caihong 5 also has a "powerful
wall-penetrating radar (that) would change the way that military drones
are used in counterterrorism missions." Maybe, but don't believe it til

duplicating the internal software that allows Predator and Reaper
operators to track and attack targets on the other side of the globe
would be a (don't miss this reference) great leap forward for the
Chinese indeed. It isn't as simple as signing up for satellite TV. [Even
many drone "experts" don't realize that the U.S. system of Remote Split
Operations, as it's called, relies on fiber optic cable to carry control

### A2 MCWs: Nuke war o/w

#### Nuclear war's climatic effects are incomparable

could wreck the planet",
<http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/02/nuclear-war-climate-change/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+wiredscience+(Blog+-+Wired+Science)>

WASHINGTON --- [[Even a small]{.mark} nuclear [exchange could
ignite]{.mark}]{.underline} mega-[[firestorms and wreck
the]{.underline}]{.mark} planet's [[atmosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶
[[New]{.mark}]{.underline} climatological [[simulations
show]{.underline}]{.mark} 100 Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs ---
[relatively [small warheads, compared to the]{.mark}]{.underline}
arsenals military superpowers stow [[today]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
detonated by neighboring countries [[would destroy]{.mark} more than a
quarter of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} Earth's
[[ozone]{.mark}]{.underline} layer in about two years.¶ Regions closer
to the poles would see even more precipitous drops in the protective
gas, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from [the]{.mark} sun.
New York and Sydney, for example, would see declines rivaling the
perpetual hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. And it may take more
than six years for the ozone layer to reach half of its former levels.¶
Researchers described the results during a panel Feb. 18 at the [annual
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science](http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2011/), calling it "a real bummer"
that such a localized nuclear war could bring the modern world to its
knees.¶ "[This is]{.underline} tremendously [dangerous,"
[said]{.mark}]{.underline} [environmental]{.mark} scientist [[Alan
Robock of [Rutgers]{.mark}
University]{.underline}](http://envsci.rutgers.edu/~robock/), one of the
climate scientists presenting at the meeting. "[The [climate change
would be unprecedented]{.mark}]{.underline} in human history, and you
can imagine the world ... would just shut down."¶ To defuse the
complexity involved in a nuclear climate catastrophe, Wired.com sat down
with [[[Michael Mills](http://acd.ucar.edu/~mmills/), an atmospheric
chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research]{.underline},]{.mark} who [[led some]{.mark} of
the]{.underline} latest simulation [[efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶
'It's pretty clear [[this would lead to a global]{.mark} nuclear
[famine]{.mark}]{.underline}.'¶ Wired.com: In your simulation, a war
between India and Pakistan breaks out. Each country launches 50 nukes at
their opponent's cities. What happens after the first bomb goes off?¶
Michael Mills: The initial explosions ignite fires in the cities, and
those fires would build up for hours. What you eventually get is a
firestorm, something on the level we saw in World War II in cities like
Dresden, in Tokyo, Hiroshima and so on.¶ [[Today we have larger
cities]{.mark} than we did then]{.underline} --- mega cities. And using
100 [[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} on these different mega cities, like
those in India and Pakistan, [[would cause]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[firestorms to build on themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}. They would
create their own weather and start sucking air through bottom. People
and objects would be sucked into buildings from the winds, basically
burning everything in the city. It'll burn concrete, the temperatures
get so hot. It converts mega cities into black carbon smoke.¶ Wired.com:
I see --- the firestorms push up the air, and ash, into the atmosphere?¶
Mills: Yeah. You sometimes see these firestorms in large forest fires in
Canada, in Siberia. In those cases, you see a lot of this black carbon
getting into the stratosphere, but not on the level we're talking about
in a nuclear exchange.¶ The primary cause of ozone loss is the heating
of the stratosphere by that smoke. Temperatures initially increase by
more than 100 degrees Celsius, and remain more than 30 degrees higher
than normal for more than 3 years. [The higher [temperatures increase
the rates of two]{.mark} reaction [cycles that deplete
ozone]{.mark}.¶]{.underline} Wired.com: And the ozone layer is in the
stratosphere, correct?¶ Mills: OK, so we live in the troposphere, which
is about 8 kilometers \[5 miles\] thick at the poles, and 16 km \[10
miles\] at the equator.¶ At the top of the troposphere, you start to
encounter the stratosphere. It's defined by the presence of the ozone
layer, with the densest ozone at the lowest part, then it tails off at
the stratopause, where the stratosphere ends about 50 km \[30 miles\]
up.¶ We have a lot of weather in the troposphere. That's because energy
is being absorbed at the Earth's surface, so it's warmest at the
surface. As you go up in the atmosphere it gets colder. Well, that all
turns around as you get to the ozone layer. It starts getting hotter
because ozone is absorbing ultraviolet radiation, until you run out of
ozone and it starts getting colder again. Then you're at the
mesosphere.¶ How Nukes Gobble Up Ozone¶ When we talk about ozone, we're
talking about the odd oxygen family, which includes both ozone (O3) and
atomic oxygen (O). Those two gases can interchange rapidly within
hours.¶ Ozone is produced naturally by the breakdown of molecules of
oxygen, O2, which makes up 20 percent of the atmosphere. O2 breaks down
from ultraviolet solar radiation and splits it into two molecules of O.
Then the O, very quickly, runs into another O2 and forms O3. And the way
O3 forms O again is by absorbing more UV light, so it's actually more
protective than O2.¶ Ozone is always being created and destroyed by many
reactions. Some of those are catalytic cycles that destroy ozone, and in
those you have something like NO2 plus O to produce NO plus O2. In that
case, you've gotten rid of a member of the odd oxygen family and
converted it to O2. Well, then you've got an NO which can react with
ozone and produce the NO2 back again and another O2. So the NO and NO2
can go back and forth and in the process one molecule can deplete
thousands of molecules of ozone.¶ [It's a similar process to
chlorofluorocarbons]{.underline}, Those are the larger molecules that
we've manufactured that don't exist naturally. [They break down into
chlorine in the stratosphere, which has a powerful ozone-depleting
ability]{.underline}. ---Michael Mills¶ Wired.com: Where do the nukes
come in? I mean, in eroding the ozone layer?¶ Mills: It's not the
explosions that do it, but the [[firestorms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Those
[[push up gases that lead to oxides of nitrogen]{.underline}]{.mark},
which act
like[chlorofluorocarbons](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/12/siberian-traps/).
But let's back up a little.¶ There are two important elements that
destroy ozone, or O3, which is made of three atoms of oxygen. One
element involves oxides of nitrogen, including nitrogen dioxide, or NO2,
which can be made from nitrous oxide, or N2O --- laughing gas.¶ The
other element is a self-destructive process that happens when ozone
reacts with atomic oxygen, called O. When they react together, they form
O2, which is the most common form of oxygen on the planet. This
self-reaction is natural, but takes off the fastest in the first year
after the nuclear war.¶ In years two, three and four, the NO2 builds up.
It peaks in year two because the N2O, the stuff that's abundant in the
troposphere, rose so rapidly with the smoke that it's pushed up into the
stratosphere. There, it breaks down into the oxides like NO2, which
deplete ozone.¶ Wired.com: So firestorms suck up the N2O, push it up
into the stratosphere, and degrade the ozone layer. But where does this
stuff come from?¶ Mills: N2O is among a wide class of what we call
tracers that are emitted at the ground. It's produced by bacterias in
soil, and it's been increasing due to human activities like nitrogen
fertilizers used in farming. N2O is actually now the most significant
human [impact on the
ozone](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/05/reactive-nitrog/), now
that we've mostly taken care of CFCs.¶ Wired.com: You did [similar
computer
simulations](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/04/regional-nuclea/)
in the past few years and saw this [ozone-depleting
effect](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/14/5307.abstract). What do the
new simulations tell us?¶ Mills: [[Before, we couldn't look
at]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[ozone]{.mark}]{.underline} depletion's
[effects on]{.underline} surface [temperatures; [we lacked a full ocean
model]{.mark}]{.underline} that would respond realistically. [The latest
runs]{.underline} are ones I've done in the Community Earth System
Model. It [has an atmospheric model, a full-ocean model]{.underline},
full-land and sea-ice models, [and even a glacier model]{.underline}.¶
We see significantly greater cooling than other studies, perhaps because
of ozone loss . [[Instead of a]{.underline}]{.mark} globally averaged
[[1.3-degree]{.underline}]{.mark}--Celsius [[drop, which [Robock's
atmospheric
mode](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.45/abstract)l
produced, it's more like 2 degrees.]{.mark}]{.underline} But we both see
a 7 percent decrease in global average precipitation in both models. And
in our model we see a much greater global average loss of ozone for many
years, with even larger losses everywhere outside of the tropics.¶ I
also gave this to my colleague [Julia
Lee-Taylor](http://acd.ucar.edu/~julial/) at
[[NCAR]{.underline}]{.mark}. She [[calculated the UV]{.mark}
indexes]{.underline} across the planet, and a lot of major cities and
farming areas would be exposed to a UV index similar to the Himalayas,
or the hole over the Antarctic. We're starting to look at the response
of sea ice and land ice in the model, [[and it seems]{.mark} to be
[heavily increasing]{.mark}]{.underline} in just a few years after the
hypothetical war.¶ Wired.com: What would all of this do to the planet,
to civilization?¶ Mills: UV has big impacts on whole ecosystems. [[Plant
height]{.mark} reduction, decreased [shoot mass]{.mark}, reduction in
[foliage]{.mark}]{.underline} area. It can affect [[genetic
stability]{.underline}]{.mark} of plants, increase susceptibility to
[attacks b]{.underline}y insects and [[pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark},
and so on. It changes the whole competitive balance of plants and
nutrients, and it can affect processes from which plants get their
nitrogen.¶ Then there's marine life, which depends heavily on
[phytoplankton](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/phytoplankton-blooms-gallery/).
[[Phytoplankton are essential]{.underline}]{.mark}; they live in top
layer of the ocean and they're the plants of the ocean. They can go a
little lower in the ocean if there's UV, but then [[they can't get as
much sunlight]{.mark} and produce as much energy. [As soon as you cut
off plants in the ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[animals would die
pretty quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}. You also get damage to larval
development and reproduction in fish, shrimp, crabs and other animals.
Amphibians are also very susceptible to UV.

#### Even a limited nuclear war outweighs 

**Dorminey 14** (Bruce, contributor to Forbes, March 8, 2014, "Regional
Nuclear War Would Still Wreak Global Climate Havoc, Says Study",
http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2014/03/08/regional-nuclear-war-would-still-wreak-global-climate-havoc-says-study///TS)

[With Ukrainian tensions mounting, the notion that such regional
conflicts could morph into something nuclear is now dogging Western
leaders in a way not seen in a generation]{.underline}. Cold War policy
was long built on Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), the idea that **[a
[global thermonuclear war would be so horrific that it was deemed
unthinkable]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. But **[even a limited regional
nuclear conflict would have catastrophic global
impact,]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as detailed in new atmospheric and
climate models in a forthcoming paper in the journal Earth's
Future]{.underline}. The paper notes that [a hypothetical exchange of a
hundred 15-kiloton warheads between India and Pakistan **could cause
firestorms** whose soot would eventually spew as high as 80 km into
earth's atmospheric mesosphere, near the edge of space. An estimated 5
Teragrams of this [black carbon would both absorb and block sunlight;
heating the stratosphere, while at least temporarily destroying much of
earth's protective ozone layer]{.mark}. A follow-on increase in
summertime ultraviolet (UV) surface radiation of as much as 80 percent
would be "off the charts"]{.underline} says Michael Mills, an
atmospheric scientist at NCAR (the National Center for Atmospheric
Research) in Boulder, Colorado, and the study's lead author. Mills notes
that [just one such 15-kiloton weapon would represent about the same
kilo-tonnage as "Little Boy," the American atomic bomb dropped on
Hiroshima, Japan. As a result of such a UV increase, Mills says those
susceptible to sunburn after only a little more than an hour in a midday
summer sun, would burn in about half the time]{.underline}. And more
importantly, [[such large amounts of ultraviolet radiation would
**destroy** both land- and sea-based ecosystems, as well as agricultural
food crops, potentially **leading to global nuclear famine**]{.mark}. At
the same time, largely due to such soot blocking incoming solar
insolation, Earth's mean global surface temperature would be expected to
cool by 1.5 degrees Celsius]{.underline} (about 2.7 degrees F); its
lowest in more than 1,000 years. [Mills says soot from such a regional
exchange today would also reduce global precipitation, creating a
plethora of wildfires, particularly in regions like the
Amazon.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, cooler surface temperatures would mean
an expansion of sea ice at both polar regions; which, in turn, would
increase Earth's albedo, or surface reflectance. This would only
exacerbate the problem of a cooling earth surface, since sea ice acts to
reflect incoming sunlight back into space, only cooling the planet
further.]{.underline} The team concluded that [within just a few years
after such an event, Arctic sea ice would increase by as much as 25
percent ; while Antarctic sea ice would more than double]{.underline}.
Mills says this is the first study to include interactive effects of
atmospheric physics, ozone chemistry, deep-ocean and sea ice response,
and land vegetation all in one earth system model. [The team ran seven
models using NASA's Pleiades Supercomputer]{.underline} at the space
agency's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. "\[We were\] expecting
to confirm earlier studies that there would be about a decade of cooler
temperatures following such an exchange," said Mills. But, instead, he
says, the team found that [cooling would last longer than 25 years;
causing growing seasons worldwide to be reduced by as much as 40
days.]{.underline} "In the 1980s, we learned that [**[global
thermonuclear war could render the planet]{.mark}** close to
**[uninhabitabl]{.mark}e**]{.underline}," said Mills. "Now, [we know
that [**even \[regional\] nuclear war can cause great suffering
worldwide, with potential for a lot of people to die from starvation**
in regions very far from a conflict."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In a [nuclear war]{.mark}, burning cities [would create]{.mark}

[This smoke would rise above cloud level, [into the stratosphere, where
it would quickly spread around the planet]{.mark}. A large nuclear war
would produce enough smoke [to block]{.mark}]{.underline} most
[[sunlight from reaching the Earth\'s]{.mark} surface. Massive
absorption of warming sunlight by a global stratospheric [smoke]{.mark}
layer [would rapidly create Ice Age temperatures on
Earth]{.mark}]{.underline} . The cold would last a long time; NASA

stratosphere ten years after a nuclear war. [Half of 1% of the]{.mark}
explosive [power of US-Russian]{.mark} nuclear [weapons can create
enough nuclear darkness]{.mark} to impact global climate]{.underline}.
100 Hiroshima-size weapons exploded in the cities of India and Pakistan
would put up to 5 million tons of smoke in the stratosphere . [The smoke
would destroy much of the Earth\'s protective ozone layer and drop
temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere to levels last seen in the
Little Ice Age. Shortened growing seasons could cause up to 1 billion
people to starve to death.]{.underline} A large nuclear war could put
150 million tons of smoke in the stratosphere and make global
temperatures colder than they were 18,000 years ago during the coldest
part of the last Ice Age. Killing frosts would occur every day for 1-3
years in the large agricultural regions of the Northern Hemisphere.
Average global precipitation would be reduced by 45%. Earth\'s ozone
layer would be decimated. Growing seasons would be eliminated. [A large
[nuclear war would]{.mark} utterly devastate the environment and [cause
most]{.mark} people to [starve to death .]{.mark} Deadly [climate
change, radioactive fallout and]{.mark} toxic [pollution would
cause]{.mark} already stressed ecosystems to collapse. The result would
be **[a mass extinction]{.mark} event that would wipe out**]{.underline}
many animals living at the top of the food chains - [including **human
beings.**]{.underline}

### Heg \-\-- no impact

#### No heg impact -- LIO resilient

Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs

In this essay I look at the evolving encounters between rising states
and the post-war Western international order. My starting point is the
classic "power transition" perspective[. Power transition theories see a
tight link between international order---]{.underline}its emergence,
stability, and decline---[and the rise and fall of great
powers.]{.underline} It is a perspective that sees history as a sequence
of cycles in which powerful or hegemonic states rise up and build order
and dominate the global system until their power declines, leading to a
new cycle of crisis and order building. In contrast, I offer a more
evolutionary perspective, emphasizing the lineages and continuities in
modern international order. More specifically, I argue that
[[although]{.mark} America's [heg]{.mark}emonic position [may be
declining]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[the liberal international
characteristics of order]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[---openness, rules,
multilateral cooperation---[are deeply rooted and likely to
persist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [This is true [ev**en though**]{.mark}
**the orientation and actions of the [Trump]{.mark} administration**
have [raised]{.mark} serious [questions]{.mark} about the U.S.
commitment to liberal internationalism. Just as importantly, [rising
states]{.mark} (led by **China**) **[are not engaged in a frontal
attack]{.mark}** on the American-led order.]{.underline} [While
struggles do exist over orientations, agendas, and leadership, **the
non-Western developing countries remain tied** to the architecture and
principles of a liberal-oriented global orde]{.underline}r. And [even as
China seeks in various ways to build rival regional institutions,
**there are stubborn limits on what it can do.**]{.underline} Power
Transitions and International Order There is wide agreement that the
world is witnessing a long-term global power transition. [Wealth and
power is diffusing, spreading outward and away from Europe and the
United States.]{.underline} [The rapid growth that marked the
non-Western rising states in the last decade may have ended, and even
China's rapid economic ascendency has slowed]{.underline}. But [the
overall pattern of change remains: the "rest" are gaining ground on the
"West."]{.underline} While there is wide agreement that the world is
witnessing a global power transition, there is less agreement on the
consequences of power shifts for international order. The classic view
is advanced by realist scholars, such as E. H. Carr, Robert Gilpin, Paul
Kennedy, and William Wohlforth, who make sweeping arguments about power
and order. These [hegemonic realists argue that international order is
a by-product of the concentration of power]{.underline}. Order is
created by a powerful state, and when that state declines and power
diffuses, international order weakens or breaks apart. Out of these
dynamic circumstances, a rising state emerges as the new dominant state,
and it seeks to reorganize the international system to suit its own
purposes. In this view, world politics from ancient times to the modern
era can be seen as a series of repeated cycles of rise and decline. War,
protectionism, depression, political upheaval---various sorts of crises
and disruptions may push the cycle forward. This narrative of hegemonic
rise and decline draws on the European and, more broadly, Western
experience. Since the early modern era, Europe has been organized and
reorganized by a succession of leading states and would-be hegemons: the
Spanish Hapsburgs, France of Louis XIV and Napoleon, and post-Bismarck
Germany. [The logic of hegemonic order comes even more clearly into view
with Pax Britannica]{.underline}, the nineteenth-century hegemonic order
based on British naval and mercantile dominance. The decline of Britain
was followed by decades of war and economic instability, which ended
only with the rise of Pax Americana. [For hegemonic realists, the debate
today is about where the world is along this cyclical pathway of rise
and decline. Has the United States finally lost the ability or
willingness to underwrite and lead the post-war order?]{.underline} Are
we in the midst of a hegemonic crisis and the breakdown of the old
order? And are rising states, led by China, beginning to step forward in
efforts to establish their own hegemonic dominance of their regions and
the world? These are the lurking questions of the power transition
perspective. **[But does this vision of power transition truly
illuminate the struggles going on today over international
order?]{.underline}** [Some might argue no---that the United States is
still in a position, despite its travails, to provide hegemonic
leadership]{.underline}. Here one would note that [there is a durable
infrastructure (or what Susan Strange has called "structural power")
that undergirds the existing American-led order]{.underline}.
[Far-flung security alliances, market relations, liberal democratic
solidarity, deeply rooted geopolitical alignments---there are many
possible sources of American hegemonic power that remain
intact]{.underline}. **[But [there may]{.mark} [be]{.mark} even
[deeper]{.mark} sources of [continuity]{.mark} in the existing
system.]{.underline}** This would be true if the existence of a
liberal-oriented international order does not in fact require hegemonic
domination. It might be that the **[[power transition theory is wrong:
the stability and persistence of the existing]{.mark} post-war
international [order does not depend on]{.mark} the concentration of
[American power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In fact, [international order is
not simply an artifact of concentrations of power]{.underline}. The
**[[rules and institutions]{.mark} that make up international order
[have a more complex and contingent relationship]{.mark} with the rise
and fall of state power]{.underline}**. This is true in two respects.
First, [international order itself is complex: multilayered,
multifaceted, and not simply a political formation imposed by the
leading state]{.underline}. [International order is not "one thing" that
states either join or resist. It is an aggregation of various sorts of
ordering rules and institutions]{.underline}. **[There are the deep
rules and norms of sovereignty. There are [governing
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, starting with the United Nations.
**[There is a sprawling array of international institutions,
[regimes]{.mark}, treaties, agreements, protocols, [and so
forth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These governing arrangements cut across
diverse realms, including security and arms control, the world economy,
the environment and global commons, human rights, and political
relations. [Some of these domains of governance may have rules and
institutions that narrowly reflect the interests of the hegemonic state,
but most reflect negotiated outcomes based on a much broader set of
interests. As rising states continue to rise]{.underline}, they do not
simply confront an American-led order; [they face a wider conglomeration
of ordering rules, institutions, and arrangements; many of which they
have long embraced**. By [separat]{.mark}ing "American
[hegemony]{.mark}" [from]{.mark} "the existing international order," we
can see a more complex set of [relationships]{.mark}.** The United
States **does not embody the international order;** it has a
relationship with it, as do rising states]{.underline}. [The United
States embraces many of the core global rules and
institutions]{.underline}, such as the United Nations, International
Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization. [But it
also has resisted ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention and the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (it being the only country not to
have ratified the latter) as well as various arms control and
disarmament agreements.]{.underline} [China also embraces many of the
same global rules and institutions, and resists ratification of
others]{.underline}. Generally speaking, the more fundamental or core
the norms and institutions are---beginning with the Westphalian norms of
sovereignty and the United Nations system---the more agreement there is
between the United States and China as well as other states.
Disagreements are most salient where human rights and political
principles are in play, such as in the Responsibility to Protect.
[Second, there is also diversity in what rising states "want" from the
international order. T]{.underline}he struggles over international order
take many different forms. In some instances, what rising states want is
more influence and control of territory and geopolitical space beyond
their borders. One can see this in China's efforts to expand its
maritime and political influence in the South China Sea and other
neighboring areas. This is an age-old type of struggle captured in
realist accounts of security competition and geopolitical rivalry.
Another type of struggle is over the norms and values that are enshrined
in global governance rules and institutions. These may be about how open
and rule-based the system should be. They may also be about the way
human rights and political principles are defined and brought to bear in
relations among states. Finally, the struggles over international order
may be focused on the distribution of authority. That is, rising states
may seek a greater role in the governance of existing institutions. This
is a struggle over the position of states within the global political
hierarchy: voting shares, leadership rights, and authority relations.
[These observations cut against the realist hegemonic perspective and
cyclical theories of power transition]{.underline}. **[Rising states do
not confront a single, coherent, hegemonic order.]{.underline}** [The
international order offers a buffet of options and choices. They can
embrace some rules and institutions and not others]{.underline}.
Moreover, stepping back, [the international orders that rising states
have faced in different historical eras have not all been the same
order]{.underline}. The British-led order that Germany faced at the turn
of the twentieth century is different from the international order that
China faces today. [The contemporary international order is much more
complex and wide-ranging than past orders]{.underline}. **[It has a much
denser array of rules, institutions, and governance
realms]{.underline}**. There are also both regional and global domains
of governance. **[This makes it hard to imagine an epic moment when the
international order goes into crisis and rising states step
forward---either China alone or rising states as a bloc---to reorganize
and reshape its rules and institutions]{.underline}**. Rather than a
cyclical dynamic of rise and decline, [change in the existing
American-led order might best be captured by terms such as continuity,
evolution, adaptation, and negotiation. **The struggles over
international order today are growing, but it is not a drama best told
in terms of the rise and decline of American hegemony.**]{.underline}

#### Hegemony is unsustainable and destabilizing

Carl **Gershman et al 14**, Tom Gjelten, Sarah Grebowski, Michael V.
Hayden, Joshua Muravchik, David Rieff and Michael Zantovsky "America\'s
Purpose and Role in a Changed World: A Symposium" World Affairs, Vol.
177, No. 1 (MAY / JUNE 2014), pp 18-49 Sage Publications, Inc.
<http://www.jstor.org/stable/43555062>

Let me begin by putting my own moral and ideological cards on the table,
since I assume that I have been asked to participate in this sympo- sium
because of, and not in spite of, the fact that [[I reject the idea
that]{.mark} America\'s global [hegemony]{.mark} is not just good for
the United States but [assures global peace and stability]{.mark} as
well, [and]{.mark} thus [is good for the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
his recent book-length article for a special issue of the New Left
Review titled \"American Foreign Policy and Its Thinkers,\" a brilliant,
implacable anatomization of the American Empire, Perry Anderson
approvingly quotes Christopher Layne\'s observation that \"[in
international relations, [benevolent hegemons are like unicorns - there
is no such animal]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" That is certainly my view. And
I would add that [[a democratic empire]{.underline}]{.mark} (for other
than its own citizens, at least) [[is]{.mark} quite simply [a
contradiction]{.mark} in terms]{.underline}. [Like every empire that has
preceded it, the American Empire has some unique characteristics, the
most salient being that it is an informal impérium]{.underline}. Whether
this makes all that much difference to [the [essential character and the
global agenda of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [seems]{.mark} to me
[highly questionable]{.mark}]{.underline}. To cite a recent example, can
anyone with any historical knowledge who has listened to the recordings
of Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs
Victoria Nuland\'s conversation with the US ambassador to Kyiv, about
who should and who should not be allowed to replace Ukraine\'s legally
elected president, Viktor Yanukovych, honestly not hear the echo of
empires past? Many will say that the recent anti-government protests in
Ukraine that culminated with Yanukovych\'s ouster demonstrate I am
completely wrong about this, and that an empire can indeed be
benevolent. As Robert Kagan put it in \"Not Fade Away: The Myth of
American Decline,\" an essay for which President Obama has expressed
great admiration, \"The present world order - characterized by an
unprecedented number of democratic nations; a greater global prosperity,
even with the current crisis, than the world has ever known; and a long
peace among great powers -- reflects American principles and pref-
erences, and was built and preserved by American power in all its
political, economic, and military dimensions.\" [[In contrast to Kagan
\'s rel- atively sanguine view]{.mark} of the durability of US hegemony,
th]{.underline}e inspiration for this sympo- sium seems to be based on
the editors\' [perceptions that [in a U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[wearied and demoralized by]{.mark} the terrible cost (in every sense of
the word) and the dismaying consequences (putting it euphemistically) of
the [wars in Afghanistan and Iraq]{.mark}, [it is becom- ing]{.mark}
increasingly [difficult to rally \"reluctant citizenry]{.mark}\" to the
cause of Ameri- ca\'s \"international engagement.]{.underline}\" I wish
this were the case, but as has so often been my experience over the past
twenty years, even though I could not disagree more with Kagan
politically, I could not agree more with him ana- lytically. To
paraphrase Mark Twain, a great anti-imperialist as well as a great
writer, reports of the death of the American Empire are greatly
exaggerated. To ask the obvious question: why are so many, including, or
so I pre- sume, the editors of this journal and most of the contributors
to this sym- posium, so worried? Surely, from their point of view,
things are not going all that badly, although the historical assumptions
that serve as their point of departure seem to me highly debatable. Is
it in fact true that the United States \"reigned confident and supreme\"
in 2000? If Americans were con- fident, surely not just 9/11, but the
rise of Chinese economic and military power, which was already very much
in train in the 1990s, demonstrated such confidence had been unwarranted
to begin with, and was, if any- thing, a penumbral effect, not to say a
narcissistic delusion, resulting from a unique event: the collapse of
the Soviet empire. As Kagan rightly insisted in his essay, \"To compare
American influence today with a mythical past of overwhelming dominance
can only mislead us.\" In my view, [the editors\' anxieties over the
risks and dangers that con- front the United States are as misleading in
their level of alarm as their portrait of the geostrategic environment
in 2000 is rose-colored.]{.underline} Are the jihadis a real adversary?
Absolutely. Are they an adversary as formidable as the Soviet Union?
Absolutely not. Are poverty and illiteracy huge prob- lems? Yes, but in
fact poverty and illiteracy have been declining steadily in most of the
developing world since 2000. And [it is hardly unreasonable to take at
least as sanguine a view of the other \"threats, challenges, and
vulnerabilities\" that the editors enumerate]{.underline}. To insist on
this point is not to say that any of the challenges that the American
Empire faces are easy. But this, I think, is where the editors\' use of
the year 2000 as a point of comparison is highly misleading, since the
1990s were the only decade in the three-quarters of a century since
[[the United States became the world\'s preeminent power when it had no
adversary.]{.mark} In other words, [it was the world of 2000]{.mark}, an
era i[n which all wars were wars of choice and global hegemony seemed to
come unchallenged and virtually cost-free]{.mark}, that was the
anomaly.]{.underline} In contrast, it was the world of the Cold War and
now, after the hiatus of the 1990s, the world we have been living in
through the first decade and a half of the twenty-first cen- tury that
actually reflect the long-term historical norm.

### Heg unsustainable

#### Structural factors make hegemonic collapse inevitable and peaceful \-- even restricting Trump can\'t reverse decline

School of International Service, American University, UNESCO Chair in
Transnational Challenges and Governance, Chair of its ASEAN Studies
Initiative. *The End of American World Order: Second Edition*. Polity
Press, Medford MA. Accessed via iBooks.)

In this new edition, I make the following arguments: [**1**. The
[global]{.mark} outpouring of [concerns surrounding Trump]{.mark}\'s
election as US President vindicate the book\'s analysis in 2014, that
the US-led liberal international order]{.underline} or the American
World Order (AWO) **[was in decline,]{.underline}** even if the US
itself was not. [**2.[Trump is the consequence, not the cause of the
decline]{.mark}** of the US-led liberal order.
**3.**]{.underline}Despite [[Trump]{.underline}\'s]{.mark} pledge to
make "America great again," he [[cannot reverse the decline]{.mark} of
the US-led world order. **4. [The global power shift from the West to
the Rest continues]{.mark}** despite recent economic slowdown and
political crisis in several BRICS nations. **5.**]{.underline} [While
[the liberal order is imploding in the West, China and India are likely
to pursue globalization]{.mark},]{.underline} albeit in a way different
from the earlier Western-led globalization. China in particular is
taking on a more assertive role in reshaping globalization and global
governance. [**6**. The architecture of global cooperation developed
under the liberal order is **fracturing** and regionalism in Europe is
facing a moment of crisis with Brexit]{.underline}, but [[**new forms of
international cooperation are emerging**,]{.mark} such as China\'s Belt
and Road Initiative.]{.underline} [**7. [While there are signs of
growing conflict and violence in the world, these are not necessarily
due to the decline of the American World Order]{.mark}**. Many of the
sources of violence are not new, and some are directly the result of
policy choices made by Western powers led by the US]{.underline} (Iraq,
Libya, and Syria). Some global challenges such as terrorism are actually
highly localized, and [there are long-term and newer sources of
stability in the world that can be further developed through renewed
cooperation and shared leadership with the emerging
powers.\"]{.underline} [A multiplex world will not be free from
conflicts and disorder]{.underline}. But absolute peace is illusory. The
goal should be to achieve relative stability, preventing major power
wars and genocide and managing regional conflicts to minimize human
suffering. [[Just because the West is losing its hegemony **does not
mean the world is doomed to chaos**]{.mark}**,** without leadership or
cooperation]{.underline}. [The nature of leadership is changing. A
multiplex world presents both challenges and opportunities for global
and regional cooperation.]{.underline} This would require the Western
nations to shed their free-riding on the US and accept shared leadership
with the rising and regional powers. It would require greater
partnership between global and regional bodies, public, private and
civil-society groups. This is a G-Plus World and requires a reformed
system of global governance that accords genuine recognition to the
voices and aspirations of the Rest. [America and its Western allies must
give up exclusive privileges in return for their trust and cooperation
in order to make the system work.]{.underline} If this is the view of an
optimist, then let me be one.

#### Heg has already collapsed for a multitude of reasons

John R. **Schindler, 17**, 12-31-2017, \"The Year American Hegemony
Ended\",
http://observer.com/2017/12/president-trump-inherited-a-hegemon-in-decline-inflicted-more-damage/,
Observer, AVD, 9

The United States has been the world's greatest power since 1945, when
that mantle---half-passed from London to Washington after the First
World War---firmly landed in American hands after the Second World War.
Since 1991, when the Cold War ended with Soviet collapse, America has
been the world's hegemon, to use the proper term, the force whose power
could not be seriously challenged on the global stage. For 26 years
now---a happy generation---America has been able to do whatever it
wanted, to anyone, at any time of our choosing, anywhere on earth.
Notwithstanding the decline of major sectors of the American economy,
our military has covered the globe with deployments as the Pentagon has
divided our planet into "geographic combatant commands" to formalize our
hegemony. Our allegedly deep defense thinkers have hailed this as our
viceroys enacting Washington's benevolent imperial will anywhere we
desire. It needs to be said that plenty of the planet has been happy to
acquiesce in American hegemony. While we're hardly the pure-hearted
hegemon we imagine ourselves to be, the United States appears like a
relatively positive force on the global stage, compared to other
options. Even among skeptics regarding America's global dominance, few
pine instead for hegemony under, say, Beijing and its Communist party
bosses. Nevertheless, [[2017 gave unmistakable signs that American
hegemony, which has been waning for a decade, has now ended.]{.mark} A
new age has dawned, even though it's still early and the sun is far from
full]{.underline}. As commander-in-chief, in his first year in the Oval
Office, President Donald Trump has ranted and raved on Twitter almost
daily, with no effect save to confuse our allies about what exactly is
going on in Washington. De facto, [[America has two foreign and defense
policies: what the president says and what our national security
bureaucracy does.]{.mark} The gap between presidential rhetoric, much of
it unhinged, and actual policy toward the world grew throughout
2017[.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's no wonder, then, that North Korea seems
anything but cowed, despite a year of Trumpian rants at Pyongyang. The
Kim dynasty keeps rattling its nuclear saber at will, firing off
missiles over the Pacific to showcase its power, and Washington's
demands that they cease have had no impact. While the Trump
administration propagates the fantasy that North Korea will never become
a nuclear power, that troublesome country has plainly had atomic weapons
for years. That this unreality-based policy might end badly for
everyone---even a merely conventional war on the Korean peninsula will
mean millions of refugees and casualties---is obvious and constitutes
one of the major what-ifs for the coming year. The National Security
Strategy recently rolled out by the White House with fanfare, however,
appreciates none of these new geopolitical realities. It imagines a
world where American power, while now confronted by Russia and a rising
China, remains above fundamental challenge. Predictably, the president's
release of "his" NSS had barely any connection to the actual document.
To be fair to Trump, the NSS always is a political write-up, not really
any kind of strategy, and the relationship between its wish-list and
actual Beltway policy is often tenuous; the current administration has
decided to sever any NSS connection to reality altogether. It should be
noted that President **[[Trump inherited a hegemon in decline. His
predecessors did plenty of damage before the current Oval Office
occupant decided to inflict more]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Bill Clinton's
well-intentioned if often mishandled humanitarian interventions in the
Balkans gave the illusion that America knew how to "nation build" broken
societies at modest cost in lives and treasure. We did not, as is
demonstrated by [[the multi-decade debacles in the Greater Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark} initiated by George W. Bush in the aftermath
of 9/11. In overreaction to jihadist terrorism, Washington decided to
recreate that troubled region by, in effect, handing a broken Iraq to
the mullahs in Tehran. The magical transformative powers of the U.S.
military on foreign societies turned out to be as much a fantasy as the
Bush experiment with mortgage loans for everyone. In a similar vein, the
less said about our never-ending war in Afghanistan---which amounts to
an effort to coercively make that country what it has never been,
politically and socially---perhaps the better. The loss of American
prestige associated with [[the Iraqi and Afghan
debacles]{.underline}]{.mark} is difficult to overstate. Plenty of the
world was content to go along with American hegemony so long as it was
somewhat competent. No fair-minded strategist, surveying what the Bush
administration did in the Muslim heartland, could look at Washington's
defense and foreign policy elites, the architects of grand failures,
with any comfort. Not that Barack Obama made things better. Although he
entered the White House with a mandate to undo the damage wrought by his
predecessor, he mostly failed to do so. It's difficult to not have
sympathy for President Obama, who when he realized the extent of the
Iraq horror he inherited, wanted to abandon the biggest failure in
America's history abroad. It's less easy to excuse Obama's missteps in
Afghanistan, where a half-hearted "surge" failed to change any facts on
the ground that really mattered. Still, Obama's biggest failures came
elsewhere. His [[willingness to participate in the overthrow of the
Gadhafi regime in Libya]{.underline}]{.mark} on dubious humanitarian
grounds birthed violence and crisis graver than existed there in the
first place. Worse, taking out the former rogue Gadhafi after he had
abandoned his weapons of mass destruction and was cooperating with
America's war on terrorism, sent an indelible message that Washington's
word is no good---so never, ever give up your WMDs. Pyongyang, among
others, watched and learned. Then there's [[Obama's mishandling of
Russia, with fateful consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. His abandonment
of his own "red line" in Syria in 2013 was easily read as a grave
strategic error, since Obama in effect outsourced U.S. policy in the
Middle East to Moscow---the results of which are painfully clear today.
Obama's reticence to do much about Vladimir Putin's aggression in
Ukraine a few months later is a matter of record, while his strange
unwillingness to confront the Kremlin over its rancid spy-propaganda
offensive against the West in 2015 undoubtedly encouraged aggressive
Russian interference in America's election the following year. Putin and
other malefactors got the message that Obama's America would not stand
up to troublemakers who could push back. Diffident messaging is never
good for the hegemon's reputation, especially when it's already blighted
due to incompetence and imperial overstretch. In 2017, in stark
contrast, Donald Trump led the country in the opposite direction, with
unceasing bluster about American strength and willingness to go it
alone, anytime Washington wants to, damn the consequences. [[Trump's
screw-the-world style in foreign affairs]{.underline}]{.mark} was on
display this month with the White House's decision to recognize
Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This pleased the Israeli right-wing and
major donors to President Trump, yet in no way enhanced American power
or prestige: quite the opposite. Reaction from the Muslim world was
predictably furious, while the Trump administration made everything
worse at the United Nations. There, Nikki Haley, our ambassador,
publicly threatened members who didn't vote with Washington against a UN
resolution condemning our embassy move. This was American diplomacy at
its most heavy-handed and tone-deaf, and it failed dismally. Virtually
the whole world voted against Trump, with even most of NATO siding
against Washington. This was a major diplomatic defeat for the alleged
global hegemon. President Trump is all about "strength" and he loves to
tweet about our military, his own draft-dodging notwithstanding. In a
sense, Trump is a perfect fit for our era, when all America has left is
raw military power. [[Our economy has been in decline for decades, our
divided society displays unmissable rot, and our politics are a partisan
shamble in the aftermath of 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}. What America has
left is its military, which is the ultimate underpinning of hegemony.
However, just how much military overmatch the Pentagon has left, after a
near-generation of down-punching in the Middle East against fourth-rate
foes without strategic success, is now America's great imponderable. We
have spent trillions of dollars on Iraq, Afghanistan, and killing
jihadists all over, and the price in military obsolescence and declining
morale is evident to anyone who wants to see. Our Air Force, which
hasn't faced a serious peer competitor in the skies since the middle of
the Second World War, is shedding pilots at an alarming rate, while it
has far too few F-22 fighters to maintain air dominance worldwide, which
Washington has taken as a given for decades. However, our Navy is in
even worse shape, with a staggering number of admirals under a cloud for
participation in an appalling corruption-cum-espionage scandal, while
our fleet in 2017 demonstrated that it has lost grip on basic navigation
at sea, with fatal results. Considering the U.S. Navy has been the
guarantor of freedom of navigation on the world's seas since 1945, the
protector of international trade and the backbone of American hegemony,
its sad decline has far-reaching consequences. That said, our Army is
equally unready for battle against a peer. In its shadow war in eastern
Ukraine, Russia's ground forces have demonstrated killing capabilities
far beyond what America and NATO can do. The combination of Russian
long-range artillery and electronic warfare has obliterated whole
Ukrainian battalions, and right now they would do the same to the U.S.
Army. Grave underinvestment in field artillery and electronic warfare
hangs over our army. Russia has excelled at artillery for centuries, and
that arm is the great killer on the modern battlefield. Armies that go
into battle outgunned by the Russians historically get blasted off the
field with heavy casualties. Right now, the U.S. Army is frantically
playing catch-up so it can take on the Russians as equals if it comes to
a fight Our army's opening performance has often been subpar, as
demonstrated by defeats like Kasserine Pass and Task Force Smith.
However, America always had time on our side to turn it around. We may
not if the battlefield is in the Baltics, which the Russians may overrun
in a couple days, before the U.S. Army has a chance to stop the invader.
These are the scenarios that keep Pentagon planners up at night as we
enter the new year. Above all, [[Trump's go-it-alone attitude is
precisely the wrong take as American hegemony
disappears.]{.underline}]{.mark} Some empires decline slowly, others
fall fast after a major defeat; history is filled with both outcomes.
Since 1945, Washington has presumed that it can deploy our military
anywhere, at the time and place of our choosing, thanks to our dominance
of the world's skies and oceans. Even in a worst case, we could always
get our forces home. This should no longer be assumed. [[The world has
changed, American hegemony has collapsed]{.underline}]{.mark}, and if
it's not careful Washington may find out the hard way. Let's hope cooler
and wiser heads prevail in 2018.

### Heg - Multipolarity solves GPW

#### Multipolarity solves nuclear great power war -- Concert of Europe

Hugh **White** **14** "Coral Bell and the Concert of Power: Avoiding
Armageddon" Power and International relations ANU Press. (2014)
<http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wwvkp.18>

Coral had an excellent education in history, and there can be little
doubt that she knew a good deal about the Concert of Europe well before
she began her career as a scholar when she arrived in London in 1951.
Over the following years she came to know and be influenced by a
remarkable group which included Martin Wight, Hedley Bull and Alistair
Buchan, whose approach to the study of international relations was, like
Coral's, strongly based on the careful application of historical
analogues to current questions. This group were certainly interested in
the idea of a 'concert of power', and they referred to it quite often,
though not at much length or in much detail. Coral herself seems (from
my reading) not to have taken much interest in the 'concert of power'
idea herself at this stage, but it seems fair to assume that this is
where here ideas about it first evolved. Coral's London colleagues were
certainly struck by the fact that [[for a century after 1815 there was
no hegemonic war between]{.mark} the [great powers of Europe]{.mark}---
that is, [no war to establish, or prevent]{.mark} the
[establishment]{.mark} [of, hegemony]{.mark} by any one
power.]{.underline} So while there were serious wars in Europe over this
time, none approached the catastrophic scale of the Revolutionary and
Napoleonic wars that preceded it, or the World Wars that followed it.
They believed that [Europe avoided hegemonic war [because]{.mark} [of
the]{.mark} nature of the relationships between the great powers
themselves, which constituted a distinctive kind of international
order.]{.underline} Two things made that order distinctive. One was a
matter of style: the way they dealt with one another. As Martin Wight
put it: '[the diplomatic system]{.underline} of the Concert
[maintained]{.underline} [standards of good faith,]{.underline} [mutual
consideration and restraint]{.underline} higher perhaps than at any
other time in international history'.4 The other was a matter of
substance: the great power's objectives in dealing with one another.
Hedley Bull saw the Concert of Power as an agreement among great powers
'that the maintenance of a general balance of power is a common
objective',5 while Herbert Butterfield wrote, '[[The Concert of
Europe]{.mark} was in origin and essence a common agreement on the
principle of the balance of power']{.underline}.6 Of course these
descriptions lead to questions about the notoriously slippery concept of
the 'balance of power' itself, but it is clear that both writers meant
in these contexts that the essence of [the 'concert of power' was an
agreement among the great powers that [none of them]{.mark} [would try
to upset the balance of power by seeking hegemony]{.mark} for
themselves.]{.underline} One can also see that there is a close
connection between the style and substance of great-power diplomacy
under a concert, because [the '[high standards']{.mark}, especially [of
restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}, that Wight mentioned [were clearly
essential to [sustain]{.mark} the [mutual forbearance about seeking
hegemony]{.mark} that the concert entailed]{.underline}. These
scholars---especially Wight---did not necessarily see the 'concert of
power' as a good thing. Wight doubted that it contributed much to the
peace of Europe, which he believed owed more to the opportunities for
expansion for the great powers outside Europe,7 and likened the
'concert' to the later appeasement of fascism, which he said was, 'in a
sense a continuation of the old system of the Concert of Europe whereby
the great powers settled matters by private bargains among themselves at
the expense of small powers'.8 The second big influence on Coral's
thinking about the 'concert of power' idea seems to have been Henry
Kissinger. The first time Coral seems to have focused directly on the
concert of power was in her 1977 book The Diplomacy of Détente: The
Kissinger Era, which as the title suggests was very much a study of
Kissinger's approach to the diplomacy of order-building. Kissinger had
of course begun his career with A World Restored about the Congress of
Vienna at which the Concert of Europe was created, and the 'concert'
idea remained central to his thinking.9 The first point to note is that
Kissinger's views of the 'concert of power' model were more positive
than those of Coral's London colleagues. She wrote of the way
Kissinger's policy of détente 'crystallises within itself the central
moral tension not only of international politics but of politics in
general: the tension between order and justice'. And she quotes
approvingly of Kissinger's resolution of this tension in favour of
order, 'The preservation of human life and human society are moral
values too'---and for Coral, as for Kissinger, **[[this is what is at
stake in avoiding Armageddon]{.underline}]{.mark}**.10 In exploring the
link between Kissinger's academic work and his policy practice Coral
offered a very neat account of the 'concert' idea and its relationship
to the concepts of balance of power and detente. It deserves to be
quoted at some length: A World Restored is often described as being
about the balance of power, but in fact it is about the working of a
concert of powers. The distinction between the two is important for an
understanding of its relevance to détente. Obviously a balance of power
underlay the nineteenth-century concert of powers, or it would not have
proved viable, just as a balance of power is now necessary as a
foundation of détente, which is not yet a concert of powers. As
Castlereagh once said, in a concert system the powers feel a common duty
as well as a common interest. [[A balance of power]{.mark} may be
regarded \[as\] a sort of force of history that [tends to assert
itself]{.mark} almost [automatically]{.mark} [in any system of
independent sovereignties]{.mark}]{.underline}. A concert of power, on
the other hand, must always be a construction of conscious statecraft.11
This passage brings out two key aspects of the 'concert of power' idea.
First, there is the central question of the relationship between a
concert of powers and a balance of power. A balance of power is
necessary but not sufficient for a concert. One cannot build a concert
unless there is already a balance of power, but much more than that is
needed to create a concert[.]{.underline} A balance of power system
emerges quite spontaneously from the independent calculations of
individual states about the best way to preserve their autonomy, but it
does not prevent hegemonic war. As Hedley Bull wrote, the balance of
power is not a system to prevent war, but to preserve the system of
states from hegemony, if necessary though the use of war.12 Thus a
balance of power system was what remained when the Concert of Europe
collapsed in 1914, and the European wars of the twentieth
century---including the Cold War---were classic examples of a balance of
power system at work to prevent hegemony through war. [The point of [a
concert]{.mark} is to [avoid hegemony without]{.mark} the need for such
[wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. To do that [the balance of power]{.mark}
must be maintained not by war but by agreement. This is why a concert
'must always be a construction of conscious statecraft'. Second, there
is the question of what is required to construct the agreements which
convert a balance of power into a concert of power. The view attributed
to Castlereagh in the passage quoted above suggests that it requires
more than simply a shared interest in the prevention of war, but mutual
acceptance of higher obligation going beyond that interest. The same
idea is hinted at in the idea that the essence of a concert is a higher
sense of good faith and obligation as expressed in the quote from Wight
above. I'm not sure it's right, and in the end I don't think Coral did
either. For her, and for me, the key difference in this respect between
a balance of power and a concert of power is not that one is based on
interest and the other on obligation, but the nature of the interest
being served. The difference is that in a balance of power system the
key interest being served for each party is to preserve its independence
by avoiding hegemony, whereas in a concert of power each party is also
driven by an interest in avoiding war at the same time. To so this they
are willing to forgo any chance of achieving hegemony themselves, and
undertake instead to respect the independence of all the other parties.
A viable concert of power depends on the strength of that undertaking
and its credibility with the other parties. The key to creating and
sustaining a concert of power is to understand how these undertakings
can be created and made credible.

#### Solves nuclear war and Asian hegemonic conflict

Hugh **White** **14** "Coral Bell and the Concert of Power: Avoiding
Armageddon" Power and International relations ANU Press. (2014)
<http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wwvkp.18>

At the end of her long life, then, Coral remained focused on how the
international system could best be managed [[to avoid
Armageddon]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is hard not to be beguiled by the
blend of determined optimism and hard reasoning which, from first to
last, she brought to this task. But we must ask: how far was she right
to see in [[the concert of power]{.mark} [the best and perhaps only
model for a stable, peaceful international order]{.mark} in the
twenty-first century]{.underline}? I think she was much more right than
wrong. I have argued elsewhere that a 'Concert of Asia' offers [the best
and perhaps only way [to avoid escalating strategic rivalry between
Asia's great powers]{.mark} over coming decades,]{.underline} for
reasons which have much in common with Coral's and owe much to her
analyses.39 But there are two ways in which I'd differ from her analysis
and predictions. First, it seems to me that an effective concert must be
smaller than Coral sometimes envisaged---[only the great powers are
involved40---and that it is much more likely to be a regional than a
global arrangement, because the redistribution of wealth and power now
underway is dismantling the global strategic system of recent
centuries.]{.underline} Second, and more fundamentally, I think Coral
was too optimistic about what would be required for a concert of power
to evolve, and what the chances are of that happening. I do not think
the 'Jihadist' threat---or the other unifying external challenges---has
or will prove big enough to overshadow the tensions inherent between the
region's major powers, and especially between the US and China. That is,
firstly, because I think the shift in relative economic and strategic
weight between them is more fundamental and thus more disruptive to the
established patterns of their relationship than Coral allows. By calling
this shift 'the end of the Vasco da Gama era' Coral leaves us in no
doubt that she sees how big this is. But even so her focus on
demographics rather than economics does lead her to overlook just how
much more important China's rise is to the redistribution of power than
the other trends she mentions. This also leads her to underestimate the
scale of the challenge it poses to the United States' power in Asia and
its role in the Asian order. And secondly, this is because she
overstates both the United States' and China's willingness to
accommodate one another's very different expectations about their future
relationships. For both countries these weigh far more in their thinking
than the 'Jihadist' threat, or the global financial crisis, or anything
else. They go to deep questions of national self-identity. Coral is
absolutely right to see a mutual accommodation of these differences as
entirely possible, and as offering a robust foundation for a stable
concert of power system if it can be achieved. But she underestimated
how hard it will be, and how likely is failure. The challenge she has
left us is to prove her optimism justified by seeing what can be done to
improve the chances of building a concert of power in Asia. That means
exploring what exactly would be required to achieve an accommodation
between the US and China---and Asia's other great powers---that would
provide the basis for peace. One might say that the best way to honour
Coral's life and work is to throw ourselves into that task, because she
was right: [[avoiding another hegemonic war---especially a nuclear
war---remains more important and more urgent than anything
else]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Heg Bad\-\--China

#### Heg under trump ensure a massive China war

Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. \"How Trump

[[Trump unrestrained is]{.mark} of course a **[frightening]{.mark}**
prospect.]{.underline} [[His instincts are not
reliable]{.underline}]{.mark}---if they were, he and his campaign would
have kept their distance from Russian operatives. [A man who has
presided over failed casinos, a collapsed airline, and a sham university
is not someone who knows when to step back from the brink.]{.underline}
[His [domestic political circumstances]{.mark}]{.underline}, already
bad, seem likely to deteriorate further, which **[[will only make him
more angry]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and perhaps more apt to take risks.
In a fit of temper or in the grip of spectacular misjudgment---possibly
influenced by what he's just seen on TV---[[he could stumble
into]{.mark} or launch [an **uncontrollable war.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
In one of the worst scenarios, [[Trump]{.mark}, as a result of his
alternating overtures to and belligerence toward China, [might bring
about a conflict with Xi Jinping]{.mark},]{.underline} who is
consolidating his own power in a way not seen since the days of Mao
Zedong. [Military [conflict between rising]{.mark} and preeminent
[global powers is hardly anomalous]{.mark}, after all, and **[the
Chinese are no longer in the mood to accept American
hegemony]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In 1990, when George H. W. Bush
confronted Saddam, an isolated dictator, a paralyzed Russia and weak
China were powerless to interfere. He had at his disposal the American
military at the peak of its post--Cold War strength, and a ready set of
allies. The United States has grown used to wars with limited risk
against minor and isolated rivals. [**[A conflict with China would be
something altogether different.]{.mark}** Trump is, and is likely to be
to the end, volatile, truculent, and impulsive.]{.underline} [When he
does face a crisis,]{.underline} whether or not it is of his own making,
[he will discover just how weak his hand is,]{.underline} because no
one---friends or enemies, the American public or foreign leaders---will
take anything that he promises or threatens at face value. At that point
we may find another Donald Trump emerging: the Trump who paid \$25
million to the victims of Trump University, who rages at The New York
Times and then truckles to its reporters. [Like most bullies, he can be
stared down. But [when he folds]{.mark}, **[American foreign policy will

### Heg Bad\-\--Econ

#### US Heg wrecks the global economy

However, there are three [[US officials]{.underline}]{.mark} who think
otherwise. They [[believe maintaining]{.mark} the absolute
[heg]{.mark}emony of the US and pursuing personal gains
[outweigh]{.mark} the wisdom of [US business]{.mark}es and
public]{.underline}, and the well-being of the world. Since Donald Trump
entered the White House, there have been factional feuds and policy
chaos within his administration. For example, on trade with China, there
are both [hardliners such as Trade Representative Robert [Lighthizer
and]{.mark} Peter [Navarro]{.mark}]{.underline}, director of the White
House National Trade Council, and moderate figures such as Secretary of
Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. After
several rounds of power wrangling, hardliners in the White House seemed
to [have [gained the upper hand]{.mark},]{.underline} with Trump,
Lighthizer and Navarro [[forming an \"iron triangle\",]{.mark} whose aim
is [to impose]{.mark} high [tariffs]{.mark} on US trade partners,
especially China, which they wrongly believe have gained unfair benefits
from trade with the US.]{.underline} As a businessman-turned-politician,
Trump claimed during his presidential campaign that China had stolen
jobs from the US and vowed to take them back for Americans. [Since
taking office, [Trump has taken a series of policy measures]{.mark} to
fulfill his campaign commitment, ostensibly to curry favor with voters,
consolidate his advantages in the midterm elections in November, and
pave the way for his re-election. To achieve these purposes, he has
ensured all previous US policies are subordinated to his personal ideas,
nay whims.]{.underline} China has become Trump\'s main target because he
believes his expert skills and tactics in business and trade may help
him realize his \"make America great again\" dream. And to push his
agenda forward, Trump looked for like-minded officials for important
posts. And Lighthizer, known as the US\' trade tsar, and Navarro, a
fabricator of the \"China threat\" theory fitted the bill perfectly.
Lighthizer is the chief designer of the investigations under Section 301
of the US Trade Act of 1974 and has participated in more than 20
international trade talks on steel, cars and agricultural products. He
is best known for his leading role in US efforts to force Japan into
signing the \"Plaza Accord\" in 1985. As early as 1999, Lighthizer
publicly declared China\'s entry into the World Trade Organization was a
threat to the US and accused Washington of backing down on trade issues.
He has been at the forefront of trade frictions with China, and is never
satisfied with any intended agreement reached with China to strike a
balance in bilateral trade. Instead, he wants to put more pressure on
China to carry out \"structural reform\" in an attempt to change
China\'s development path. As for Navarro, he had never visited China
before this year. He focused on electricity and energy in his early
years, but this did not prevent him from becoming a second-hand
materials expert, cobbling together the \"China threat\" theory and a
few books identifying China as an \"imaginary enemy\". He has never let
go a single opportunity to launch a verbal attack on China using his
so-called experience of working with several US agencies. Eventually, he
caught the attention of Trump, and was appointed as one of his main
policy advisers. [As a staunch [supporter of populism and
protectionism]{.mark}, the \"iron triangle\" in the White House [suffers
from zero-sum mentality]{.mark} and is determined to maintain US
hegemony.]{.underline} However, the triumvirate doesn\'t know much about
China and thus has an obsessive bias against the country. To begin
with[, [Trump has no experience]{.mark} of a trade war,]{.underline} and
he would be overestimating his capability if he believed China could be
subdued by using some business deals and extreme pressure. Lighthizer
did achieve success in dealing with Japan in the 1980s, but China today
is not what Japan was in 1985, and the strategy and tactics that proved
effective against Japan decades ago will simply not work against China.
And the theory Navarro has cooked up to deal with \"China\'s economic
aggression\" may seem potent, but only on paper. US citizens just
celebrated Independence Day on July 4. [Ironically, though, after more
than two centuries of development, the free trade and open policies
pursued by US statesmen in the past have been overturned by the Trump
administration.]{.underline} The traditional values that made the
founding fathers of the US proud are being upended and shelved by the
\"iron triangle\". [[There is little doubt the US is drifting toward
isolationism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some say **[[the US is on the
decline]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But who is to blame? US leaders, of
course.

### China Soft Power Mod

#### Chinese arms export expansion leads to their integration as a foreign policy tool -- boosts soft influence

**Béraud-Sudreau 18** Lucie Béraud-Sudreau is Research Fellow for
Defence Economics and Procurement and Meia Nouwens is Research Fellow
for Chinese Defence Policy and Military Modernisation at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies., 7-7-2018. Are arms
exports a tool of Chinese foreign policy? . East Asia Forum.

/jh

At the 19th Chinese Communist Party Congress in October 2017, President
Xi Jinping reaffirmed China's ambition to complete the modernisation of
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by the middle of the 21st century.
This has involved two decades of deepening civil--military integration
as well as more recent reform of China's defence and technological
industrial base, the introduction of competition between Chinese
state-owned defence enterprises and further integration of the private
defence manufacturing sector. But what role do defence exports play in
China's diplomacy and foreign policy?

[New agencies have been created]{.underline}, such as the Central
Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development and the
Scientific Research Steering Committee, [to push forward the research
and development of state-of-the-art weaponry.]{.underline} In 2017 and
2018, China's Central Military Commission Equipment Development
Department released thousands of declassified defence-related patents to
the public in an effort to support private companies entering China's
defence industry. Similarly[, China is looking to the private sector to
integrate]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline})
technology [into the PLA.]{.underline} One only needs to look to China's
investment in AI start-ups to get a sense of scale: [China has overtaken
the United States, with 48 per cent of total worldwide equity funding to
AI start-ups in 2017 attributed to China compared to 38 per cent for the
United States.]{.underline}

The reform of [China's defence industry]{.underline} is far from
complete, and the industry [still faces obstacles including the
dominance of state-owned enterprise monopolies and a lack of clear
legislative and regulatory frameworks for civil--military
integration.]{.underline} But overall, Beijing's reform efforts have not
gone without effect. [A number of Chinese firms are leading the
development and export of]{.underline} unmanned aerial vehicles
([UAVs]{.underline}). In 2017, the China Electronics Technology Group
Corporation and the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation
worked with a commercial fixed-wing drone model by Skywalker Technology
to launch in the world's largest fixed-wing drone swarm. By 2018[, China
had exported heavy and armed UAVs to more than 10 countries
worldwide.]{.underline}

[The modernisation of the Chinese defence industry]{.underline}, in
combination with competitive pricing, has [enabled China to become a
major arms exporter and not be dependent on imports.]{.underline} While
the volume of Chinese arms exports grew by 275 per cent between 2000 and
2017, [its arms imports decreased by 56 per cent]{.underline}, according
to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Over the past
ten years, China accounted for 5.2 per cent of total arms trade, behind
the United States (32.4 per cent), Russia (23.7 per cent), Germany (6.6
per cent) and France (6.2 per cent).

But [the geographical distribution of Chinese arms sales has not varied
significantly over time.]{.underline} China still mainly sells to its
traditional customers Pakistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh, which account
for 63 per cent of its total exports over the past five years. The only
region to which there has been a visible increase in Chinese arms
exports is Latin America, from 0 per cent in the early 2000s to 5 per
cent by 2017. This includes arms transfers to Bolivia and Venezuela in
particular.

Chinese arms sales appear to be more transactional than an instrument of
foreign policy. For instance, there has been no uptick in Chinese arms
deliveries to core Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partner countries
since this initiative was announced in 2013. Indeed, out of the 74
countries that are directly linked to BRI projects, only 23 of them ---
31 per cent --- have received Chinese major weapon systems since 2013.

Further evidence of China's transactional arms exports is the arms
diplomacy that China and Taiwan have tried to apply to woo allies on the
world stage. While economic incentives have been widely used to
influence changes in diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People's
Republic of China, [China has not]{.underline}, in the past five years,
[transferred any major conventional weapons systems to countries that
recognise or used to recognise Taiwan.]{.underline}

Both of these examples reflect the fact that arms sales are not a
straightforward foreign policy tool to [manoeuvre. Arms sales take place
if and only if recipient states have the need for new weapons systems
and have a preference for Chinese products. China still traditionally
sells to states where Western exporters will not sell due to sanctions
(like Iran), states that cannot afford to purchase Western weapons
systems]{.underline} (like Zambia) [and states that fall into both
categories]{.underline} (like Sudan and Venezuela). [The only niche
market where China has been able to make inroads into traditional
Western export markets such as Gulf countries has been that of UAVs.
This again was possible because Western exporters, in this case the
United States, refused to sell their own systems.]{.underline}

[China's strong defence--industrial modernisation drive undertaken in
the past two decades has served the PLA's ambitions]{.underline}. This
does generate some opportunities for Chinese arms transfers, but
[Chinese defence companies still have to make a more significant mark in
the global arms market if defence exports are to become part of the
Chinese government's broader foreign policy toolkit.]{.underline}

#### China influence solves warming

China\'s \"Green Soft Power\" For Responsible Belt and Road Initiative
Investment,\" Forbes,

China's Belt and Road initiative (BRI) presents a challenge to global
efforts to tackle climate change and move toward a carbon neutral
pathway. With \$900 billion in potential foreign infrastructure spending
under the BRI framework indicated by President Xi, China's BRI could
help -- or hurt -- clean energy development in emerging economics.
**[[China has trumpeted its commitment to build a green BRI,]{.mark}
most recently at the BRI Summit in Beijing, and as far back as 2015 when
the central government stated ["efforts should be made to promote green
and low-carbon infrastructure construction and operation management,
taking into full account the impact of climate change]{.mark}.\" Since
then, China has issued related policies including the "Guiding Opinions
on Promoting a Green BRI."]{.underline}** China has promoted some clean
[energy]{.underline} through the BRI. In Argentina, China Development
Bank and China Export-Import Bank provided 85% of the financing for the
500 megawatt Cauchari solar power plant, the largest in Latin America.
The AIIB, for its part, has participated in several clean energy
projects including Egypt's 2 gigawatt Benban Solar Park, one of the
world's largest projects, expected to go online in 2019. But investment
analysis by World Resources Institute and Boston University found that
around 75% of investment in BRI countries from China's state-owned banks
between 2014 and 2017 poured into fossil fuel projects. In addition,
China-financed hydropower plants in Mongolia, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, and Indonesia have been criticized for ignoring environmental
impacts and creating potentially irreversible damage. The challenge for
many countries receiving BRI financing is familiar -- how can
policymakers balance economic development and environmental protection?
Much like in China 20 years ago, improving access to electricity -- a
critical precondition for employment, poverty alleviation, and public
health -- is the top policy priority. These development needs can
overwhelm efforts to mitigate environmental and climate change risks.
Local policies can make Belt and Road investments more sustainable The
set of policies needed to regulate the environmental impact of China's
overseas development finance is large, complex, and less binding than
domestic policies within China, as documented by Tufts University
professor Kelly Sims Gallagher. As a recent World Bank report stated,
"China has a growing collection of guidelines \[for BRI investment\] but
they still lack essential details concerning implementation, monitoring,
and enforcement." But China's policies are only half of the equation.
The environmental, energy, and climate policies in countries receiving
BRI financing are equally important -- if not decisive -- in determining
the environmental impact of projects receiving BRI investment. And
public opinion in many countries receiving BRI financing supports
sustainable investments: A new poll shows large majorities of citizens
in Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Turkey, and
Vietnam prefer renewable energy to coal. The WRI-Boston University
analysis recommends that Chinese investment should be linked to the
National Determined Contribution (NDC, under the Paris Agreement) of
countries receiving BRI financing, but this is only a partial solution.
Indonesia's NDC, for example, accommodates an energy development plan
allowing coal-fired power to expand by around five times its current
size by 2050. And Indonesia's projected CO2 emissions could surpass the
United States before 2050 without strong policy interventions. In the
end, the laws and regulations in countries receiving BRI financing --
what kinds of appliances can be used, what kinds of cars can be driven,
what kinds of buildings can be built, what kind of energy can be used --
will determine local energy consumption and emissions patterns.
Harnessing China\'s \"Green Soft Power\" So what policy approach should
China take? Setting stringent environmental guidelines for its overseas
investments -- a "hard power" approach -- is important. But it is even
more important that China provide financial and technical support to its
BRI partners by sharing experiences and lessons-learned in clean energy,
environment, and climate policies -- China's "green soft power."
[[First, China should recognize and harness its green soft
power]{.mark}. Although China is still trying to win its war on
pollution, it has established a comprehensive system of laws,
regulations, and strategic plans to protect the environment and expand
clean energy.]{.underline} For example, China has established stricter
power plant pollution emission requirements than the U.S. and European
Union. China's Stage 6 light duty vehicle standard is one of the most
stringent emission standards in the world, according to the
International Council on Clean Transportation. And some of China's
minimum energy efficiency standards (MEPS) for home appliances are
catching up to those in developed countries. China is also increasingly
willing to drive in global environmental governance, a common theme in
President Xi's promotion of ecological civilization. Finally, China
excels at strategic planning to promote new industry development, like
renewable energy -- it's booming solar industry has clearly benefited
from this long-term planning. [[Many developing countries along the
"Belt and Road" can draw upon China's experiences, particularly its
environmental protection and carbon mitigation practices, which, as a
developing economy, may be more relevant to BRI countries than
experiences in developed economies]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
China\'s problem of overcapacity in coal-fired power plants might also
soon appear in Central Asian BRI countries. China can share
lessons-learned in this area with its BRI partners. Second, Chinese
policymakers should carefully map out sector-by-sector policy gaps
between China and other BRI countries to identify the ones with the
largest emissions mitigation or environmental impact potential. This
will allow policy discussions to focus on the most important areas of
work. Ecological protection standards related to mining, minimum
efficiency levels for energy intensive industrial products, and green
standards for infrastructure development can all be adapted to BRI
countries. Third, China should emphasize the importance of long-term
strategic planning within partner countries. China's success in
developing long-term comprehensive plans for clean energy, energy
conservation, and emission reductions actions could provide material for
technical assistance or promote collaborative long-term energy
development strategies between China and BRI countries. This
coordination in the context of climate change could help to avoid
locking investments into high-risk fossil fuel projects. For example,
the majority of BRI-related Chinese investment in Jordan, identified by
the WRI-Boston University research as one of the BRI's top three
investment destinations, is flowing into shale oil development projects
that meet local energy supply diversification requirements. However,
Jordan's abundant solar and wind energy resources along with cheap
desert land make it technically feasible for solar to supply six times
the country's current total electricity demand by 2050. With the right
support for long-term planning, Jordan could shift from fossil fuels
toward renewable power. Is green cooling the first step toward a
sustainable Belt and Road? [Joint policy research and technical
cooperation should lead the way to leverage China's soft green power for
a sustainable Belt and Road. Think tanks and civil society organizations
based in developed countries have played this collaborative role with
China and many emerging economies by sharing economic experiences while
providing counsel on planning, policy, and standards development.
China\'s academic and research institutions are now in a similar
position to initiate close and long-term substantive collaboration with
counterparts in BRI countries.]{.underline} Last month's joint launch of
a BRI Green Cooling Initiative by the National Development and Reform
Commission, Energy Foundation China, and the United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and Industrial Development
Organization is a good example of joint research and coordination.
Global cooling is on the brink of a huge economic boom and the new BRI
Green Cooling Initiative calls for cooperation between China and BRI
partners developing cooling efficiency standards for air conditioners
and refrigerators. China is already the world's largest manufacturer,
consumer, and exporter of cooling technologies and it could expand this
market position by exporting green cooling products while helping other
countries set efficiency standards -- the perfect embodiment of green
soft power. **[[Much of the groundwork for China to use it green soft
power is already in place -- now China has to step up and get to
work.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The fourth factor contributing to the perception of a China threat is
the fear of [political]{.underline} and economic [[collapse in the PRC,
resulting in territorial fragmentation, civil war and waves of]{.mark}
[refugees]{.mark}]{.underline} pouring into neighbouring countries.
Naturally, any or all of these scenarios [[would have a
profound]{.mark}ly negative [impact on regional
stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Today the Chinese [leadership
faces]{.mark}]{.underline} a raft of [[internal problems,
including]{.underline}]{.mark} the increasing political demands of its

[[deterioration in the]{.mark} natural [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[caused by]{.underline}]{.mark} [[rapid]{.underline}]{.mark}

problems are putting a [strain]{.mark} on [the central government\'s

effectively]{.underline}. [Political
[disintegration]{.mark}]{.underline} or a Chinese civil war [[might
result in millions of]{.mark} Chinese [refugees]{.mark} seeking asylum

unprecedented [exodus]{.underline} of refugees from a collapsed PRC
[would]{.underline} no doubt [put a severe strain on the limited

also [result in]{.underline} another nightmare scenario - [[nuclear
weapons fall]{.mark}ing [into the hands of]{.mark} irresponsible
[local]{.mark} provincial [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} or warlords.2
From this perspective, [a [disintegrating China
would]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[pose a threat to]{.underline}]{.mark}
its neighbours and [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Should the CCP undergo some sort of dramatic
transformation]{.underline} -- whether that be significant reform or
complete collapse, as some radical China scholars predict2 -- [the
implications for international and US national security are
vast]{.underline}. [Not only does China and the stability of the CCP
play a significant role in the maintenance of peace in the East Asian
region, but China is also relied upon by many members of the
international community for foreign direct investment, economic
stability and trade.]{.underline} [China plays a key role in maintaining
stability on the Korean Peninsula]{.underline} as one of North Korea's
only allies, and it is argued that [instability within the Chinese
government could also lead to instability in the already sensitive
military and political situation across the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}.
For the United States, [the effect of instability within the CCP would
be widespread and dramatic.]{.underline} [As the United States' largest
holder of US treasury securities, instability or collapse of the CCP
could threaten the stability of the already volatile economic situation
in the US]{.underline}. In addition, [China is the largest trading
partner of a number of countries, including the US, and the US is
reliant upon its market of inexpensive goods to feed demand within the
US.]{.underline}

It is with this in mind that China scholars within the United States and
around the world should be studying this phenomenon, because the
potential for reform, [instability or]{.underline} even [collapse of the
CCP is of critical importance to the stability of the international
order as a whole]{.underline}. For the United States specifically, the
potential - or lack thereof - for reform of the CCP should dictate its
foreign policy toward China. If the body of knowledge on the stability
of the Chinese government reveals that the Chinese market is not a
stable one, it is in the best interests of the United States to look for
investors and trade markets elsewhere to lessen its serious dependence
on China for its economic stability, particularly in a time of such
uncertain economic conditions within the US.

[TOKYO --- [Most]{.mark} Western [predictions about the future of
China's rise are ominous,]{.mark} ranging from theories about how the
country will perfect an authoritarian society to how it will serve as a
model for a less free future.]{.underline} But while reporting in Japan
on Wednesday, I heard the most troubling prediction about China yet ---
and it was actually about the country's decline. "If the central
government runs out of money, then they're in trouble," Akio Takahara,
one of Japan's leading scholars on China, told US-based reporters. "If
you talk to the Chinese people, they'll tell you that this \[system of
government\] cannot last forever. So someday there will be a big change,
but they don't know when, they don't know how, or what the process will
be," Takahara said. And, he added, it won't necessarily be peaceful.
There are two worrying things packed into that analysis, so let's take
each in turn. First, on the surface it seems impossible that China ---
the world's second-strongest economy --- would run out of cash any time
soon. But there are signs that China is undergoing a significant
slowdown, partially because of President Donald Trump's trade war. Some
economists have long held that China vastly inflates its economic growth
rate, which officially stands at 6.5 percent right now. But the
predictions are getting more dire, with one Chinese economist predicting
that China's real growth rate is zero. If true, that could cause
significant problems for Chinese President Xi Jinping and put strain on
the Communist Party's hold on power. [Second, the US and other countries
for decades hoped that engaging China would prompt it to open up its
economy and eventually become a more democratic society. The hope,
though, was that shrewd management of China's transition to democracy
would make it relatively painless --- and even bloodless.]{.underline}
But the trade war and the Trump administration's antagonism toward
Beijing has changed all that. It's pretty clear the White House wants to
(destroy) cripple China's economy to the point that its government, led
by the [Communist Party]{.underline}, [collapse]{.underline}s[. [If
that's the case, it could turn into one of the world's worst
humanitarian catastrophes]{.mark}. [China is home to more than a billion
people, many of whom would prefer to see the party maintain control.
Others might try to leverage the government's weakness and violently
revolt against it. A civil war on a scale never seen before in human
history is therefore sadly a possibility --- albeit a very small
one.]{.mark} Nonetheless, "it's frightening to think about," Takahara
said.]{.underline}

### CCP Collapse Bad -- Economy

#### A CCP collapse would have devasting effects to the global economy

[[This October will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China. This is an anniversary many Western
observers doubted the PRC would ever reach -- or, at least not in its
present form with unchallenged authoritarian one-party
rule.]{.underline} I]{.mark}t was the hope of American policymakers that
by engaging with China and encouraging China to participate in the
international system, the country would not just open up economically
but would also liberalize and, eventually, democratize. [There was also
a belief among some scholars that economic growth and prosperity was not
sustainable under China's current political system and that China would
ultimately be forced to change or face collapse. China's collapse, while
often predicted, did not come to fruition. The Chinese Communist Party
retained control and now arguably one of its strongest individual
leaders has come to power -- Xi Jinping.]{.underline} After seven
decades, are the arguments for China's pending downfall any more
credible? After all, China has frequently defied expectations. However,
the situation today is increasingly precarious, despite the CCP's past
resilience and ability to retain control while simultaneously growing
the country's economy and global influence. [China is in a period of
uncertainty. It is in the process of trying to redefine itself and its
role in the world now that it is has reached a certain level of
development. China is no longer the "sick man of Asia" or a poor
developing country courting the help of the Western international
system. At the same time, however, the country also has to come to terms
with a slowing rate of growth as well as other serious domestic issues
like pollution, economic disparity, and an aging population. And to
complicate matters further, all these problems need to be tackled by the
Communist Party leadership even while they maintain a firm grip over the
internet, society, and public perception in order to fortify their own
rule.]{.underline} China's "super-rich" are increasingly pessimistic
about China's economic future. Experts caution that the Chinese
leadership is extending itself too far, seeing echoes of Soviet
mismanagement in China's ambitious projects like the Belt and Road.
[Premier Li Keqiang cautioned members of the National People's Congress
that "there are greater expected and unexpected risks and challenges,
and we have to make full preparations for a hard struggle." President Xi
Jinping himself even warned officials "to strengthen their ability in
preventing and defusing major risks to ensure sustained and healthy
economic development and social stability." At the same time, the
international environment has changed. The clearest example of this is,
of course, the current U.S.-China trade war. The hope that China would
liberalize as it grew disappeared as soon as China began to assert
itself as a new global power. In light of this, American policymakers
are no longer pursuing their decades long policy of engagement toward
China. Now they are demanding accountability and reciprocity. American
policymakers, media, and scholars have increasingly been positioning
China as not simply a challenge or competitor, but as the greatest
threat to the United States --- a clear enemy. The White House's
National Security Strategy outlined China as one of the main challengers
to American power. This year's Conservative Political Action Conference
focused heavily on China, with China-centric panels called "China, the
global menace," "21st century terminator," and even "The Gathering
Storm," which is a reference to Winston Churchill's book about the lead
up to World War II.]{.underline} In December 2018, the U.S. Senate held
a committee hearing titled "China's Non-Traditional Espionage Against
the United States" and in February, Admiral Philip S. Davidson told the
Senate that China "represents the greatest long-term strategic threat to
a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and to the United States." Now U.S.
policymakers and academics are considering the merits of disengagement
with China, a clear reversal of previous policy. Some, it seems, are
hoping to bring about China's decline, or at least that of the ruling
Communist Party. In March, the "Committee on the Present Danger: China"
(CPDC) was launched in Washington, DC by former military officials,
business leaders, academics, and former White House officials, including
Steve Bannon. One of the "guiding principles" listed on their website is
that "there is no hope of coexistence with China as long as the
Communist Party governs the country." [Perhaps this sentiment is out of
fear of America's own decline or a deeply entrenched distrust for what
was once commonly called "Red China." Or maybe there is a need for a
sense of vindication -- that a communist, authoritarian rule like that
in China truly can't last forever. Whatever the motivation, U.S. policy
and discourse is pushing back against China. As has happened so often in
the past, however, this goal is dangerously short-sighted. A number of
American China watchers famously predicted China's collapse and were
proved wrong, including Gordan Chang's The Coming Collapse of China in
2001 and David Shambaugh's Wall Street Journal essay "The Coming Chinese
Crackup" in 2015. But what were to happen if current conditions finally
did lead to China's collapse? China is not the Soviet Union. And Xi
Jinping is most certainly not Gorbachev. In fact, the Chinese Communist
Party has made every effort to learn from the Soviet Union's downfall
what to avoid. Instead of promoting "openness," China is cracking down
on society more than ever before. While Gorbachev called for democratic
elections, Xi is working to solidify his personal power, eliminating
term limits. Even if Xi and the Communist Party were to fall out of
power, who would replace them? There is no Chinese equivalent to Boris
Yeltsin and his supporters]{.underline}. [China's collapse and the fall
of the Chinese Communist Party would have to happen differently. And, I
fear, it might have more in common with China's own history than with
that of the Soviet Union. I was living in China when the previous regime
fell. It was most definitely not a peaceful transition from Nationalist
to Communist rule. I witnessed the turmoil and chaos of the Chinese
Civil War firsthand.]{.underline} The joy and hope the Chinese felt
after World War II ended and we were finally freed from years of
Japanese occupation were quickly shattered as the domestic conflict
escalated. [[With the collapse of the Republic of China came
hyperinflation and starvation. Families were displaced and scrambled to
find some semblance of shelter or security. There was blood, violence,
and death]{.mark}. Americans talk about the scar of their own civil war
-- brothers killing brothers. China's was much more recent. I distinctly
remember the uncertainty and fear that permeated everything. Most
Chinese didn't care about Nationalist or Communist. They were just
trying to make it through]{.underline}. And yet, these normal civilians
were forced to face untold hardships as the war raged on around them.
[[If China once again devolved into economic chaos or violence, the
ramifications would only be worse. China currently holds more than
one-sixth of the world's population. And, due to globalization, China's
economy is intertwined with that of the rest of the world more than ever
before. China's collapse, or even decline, would ripple across the
Asia-Pacific and the world]{.underline}.]{.mark} Today's leaders, in
both the United States and China, do not truly understand what's at
stake. I do. I will never forget the hardships of the Sino-Japanese War
and the civil war that followed. American policymakers and scholars are
not wrong to wonder what an ever-stronger China would mean or to demand
that China adjust its policies and practices that are harmful to the
United States. At the same time, however, it is just as important to ask
what would happen if China collapsed and what that would mean not just
for the United States, but for the world. I hope the U.S. and China will
learn from the past and strive for a peaceful future. Managing China's
decline would be precarious [The main takeaway from Takahara's comment,
at least for me, [is that dealing with China's potential decline could
prove just as challenging as its rise. Because China is so important to
the global economy, few want it to ultimately collapse]{.mark}, but
Washington doesn't want Beijing to surpass its power,
either]{.underline}. The US has yet to figure out how best to find a
middle path, so to speak. The engagement strategy employed from Richard
Nixon to Barack Obama didn't fully work because it helped make China
much stronger with little societal opening, and Trump's trade deal may
make things way worse by taking the global economy down with Beijing.
That means the US has yet to figure out how best to deal with China.
That's a problem, as China's own instability could force the US to make
up its mind sooner rather than later.

Jinping of China arriving for the opening of the National People's
Congress in Beijing last year. [Mr. Xi is expected to gain another five
years at the helm this year]{.underline}. Sebastian Heilmann, 51, is the
founding president of the Mercator Institute of Chinese Studies (Merics)
in Berlin and a government professor at the University of Trier. He has
published extensively on Chinese industrial and technological policies,
the Chinese Communist Party's organizational structure and how today's
China reflects the party's history as a revolutionary organization
forged in remote, scattered regions of the country. One of Mr.
Heilmann's major works is a comprehensive guide to how China is
governed, now updated and translated into English as "[[China's
Political System]{.underline}]{.mark}." This is a wide-ranging
examination of how the system works --- how it [[guides the economy,
provides services to people and formulates new
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}. An online version of the book will be
updated every two to three months, allowing readers to stay in touch
with the creation of government agencies or campaigns. [In an interview,
Mr. Heilmann discussed the underappreciated strengths of China's
political system as well as how, under President Xi Jinping, it may have
cast off some of the openness to experimentation that contributed to its
success in recent decades]{.underline}. [What is striking about your
book are the case studies, showing how different ministries and
commissions actually function.]{.underline} We wanted to show
problem-solving, or what's known as the provision of public goods. For
example, how exactly does it create a rural health care system? How does
it ensure food safety? These are issues that governments around the
world have to deal with. It's about more than ideology. It's about how
the system actually works. [Another unusual feature that we try to
explain is how the system of cadres \[party officials\] functions. In
the West, policies are set by law and then carried out by civil
servants. In China, policy implementation depends on cadres. They are
given clear]{.underline} [metrics and goals for achieving things and
then told to go do them. Major policy shifts and top-down initiatives
are managed through this cadre system, not by making laws.]{.underline}
For example? Xi Jinping's anticorruption campaign. [The Communist Party
has expanded and mobilized a parallel disciplinary bureaucracy with
great powers to step in and investigate. But it has no clearly defined
legal basis. Its operations are directed by party documents and internal
directives. A key question you pose is how much of China's success can
be ascribed to this political system.]{.underline} What's the answer?
There are several important elements. One [[is the party successfully
sets long-term political goals]{.mark},]{.underline} such as the
modernization of industry or technology, or infrastructure planning. As
Deng Xiaoping made clear in the 1980s, [[it can concentrate resources in
priority areas]{.mark}. I see this as a strength in the initial phase of
development]{.underline}, from say the 1980s to the mid-2000s. [Another
crucial element is [experimentation]{.mark}. This [is something we
ignore in the West]{.mark} --- how unexpectedly flexible China's deeply
bureaucratic system can be. This [flexibility has been demonstrated in
the ability to set up pilot projects in special economic zones]{.mark},
in local tests --- [such as for housing reform]{.mark} or bankruptcy in
state enterprises. Very difficult measures were regularly tested in
pilot projects for several years before national laws were
enacted.]{.underline} You show how this flexibility arose from the
Communist Party's revolutionary experience. This is very important.
Because we have to ask ourselves[, how did a socialist bureaucratic
system get this kind of adaptability that you didn't see in Eastern
Europe? It's due to the specific historical experiences of this party
\[in the 1930s and 1940s before coming to power\]. It controlled very
spread-out and not contiguous districts. So when it tried something like
land reform it was done experimentally and in a decentralized fashion.
This was fundamentally different from the Soviet Union. This willingness
to experiment was also a hallmark of the Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin
periods.]{.underline} It only largely ended with Xi Jinping with the
idea of "top-level design." There was a feeling that these decentralized
experiments contributed to corruption and a lack of discipline. So now
every policy initiative has to be approved by the center. This has taken
a lot of the energy out of China's political system. There was an
argument that reforms must proceed in sequence, so they had to be
coordinated. But the effect has been that not much has happened since
2013 \[when Mr. Xi became president\] in terms of ground-up
problem-solving. If you rely on hierarchy and discipline, the courage to
experiment at the lower levels is squeezed out. People are afraid of
trying things. [Ironically[, it's only now that some countries are
looking at China as a model. Can it be a model]{.mark}?]{.underline} For
many years I would have said no, but many countries are struggling with
how to deal with pressing basic problems like maintaining internal
security, building physical infrastructure and providing jobs. These are
the basis of populist movements around the world. [[China is a point of
orientation]{.underline}]{.mark}. It can't be duplicated because these
other countries don't have a Communist Party with the special history
and features of China's. [[But in terms of
considering]{.underline}]{.mark} illiberal, [[state-directed solutions,
China is often cited as an example of how an authoritarian government
can deal with things differently.]{.mark} China's experience is thus a
permanent question mark for the world when they ask if the Western model
is the best. Toward the end of the book you offer several scenarios for
how China might develop, and poll Merics staffers for their views. Most
support the first scenario, which is a "centralized and disciplined
party and security state]{.underline} (the Xi Jinping system)." You are
less sure, arguing that the risks are greater than people realize. I'm
not sure that the party can achieve everything it's set out to do. It's
tried to keep a lid on all changes in society, but I doubt this can work
over time. There are different lifestyles and forces in society. I'm not
sure they can be unified. I'm very skeptical. Also, we shouldn't forget
that hierarchical systems are susceptible to shocks. If Xi Jinping
became seriously ill, what would happen to the political system? The
system has been tailored to him. Or, if there are military skirmishes,
how will the nationalistic forces in society react? This system is built
for expansion, especially economic expansion, and setbacks are very hard
to justify. It's easier in Western systems because you can change the
government. But in China you can't. So the potential for disruption is
greater than people imagine.

#### Chinese leadership solves warming

**Engels 18** Anita Engels, 8-14-2018. Understanding how China is
championing climate change mitigation. Palgrave Communications.
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0150-4

While the world witnessed the first global increase in carbon emissions
in 2017 after 3 years without growth (Le Quéré et al., 2018), [it is
worth examining popular assumptions relating to the new climate change
mitigation championship and leadership role of China]{.underline}, which
became the world's single largest carbon-emitting country in
approximately 2007.

The global climate governance regime has changed in several important
ways in recent years. This includes a change in the architecture of the
climate agreement from top down to bottom up, and a proliferation of
actors, forms, and levels of governance (Aykut, 2016), leading to hybrid
multi-lateralism with as yet uncertain outcomes (Kuyper et al., 2018).
[The announcement of the US government's withdrawal from the Paris
Agreement was seen as a first major backlash]{.underline}. Across the
world, populist parties that reject the Paris Agreement are gaining
influence, and countries trying to pursue a transformation of their
energy systems towards renewables are experiencing serious slow-downs.
[Against this backdrop China has adopted relative and absolute reduction
goals and has announced a peak in its CO2 emissions by 2030]{.underline}
(People's Republic of China, 2015).

Observers have argued that [China has introduced vigorous policies that
have already effectively reduced its carbon emissions, with some
commentators extending this to the expectation that China will be the
new leader in global climate mitigation]{.underline} (Biesecker and
Watt, 2017; Zhao, 2017). In terms of CO2 output, China has already shown
impressive results, even though the data on which this assessment is
based suffers from a certain lack of accuracy and accountability
(Korsbakken et al., 2016). [China's economy was heavily dependent on
fossil fuels for decades]{.underline}, especially domestic coal, and saw
a rapid growth of energy use and related CO2 emissions until 2010 (see
Fig. 1[). However, starting in 2008, the Chinese government adopted a
proactive stance towards climate policy.]{.underline} Following the
introduction of the 12th Five-Year-Plan (2011--2015), a policy shift
towards a new low-carbon development model was introduced (Li and Wang,
2012). China's rapid success in limiting its own domestic CO2 emissions
has surprised many observers in the past few years, stemming from an
increase in renewable energy and a decrease in the production and
consumption of coal (see Fig. 1). The rise in renewable energies implies
a rapid increase in installed domestic capacity, which began under the
clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, after which
China became the largest CDM recipient (Wang, 2010). [As a consequence
of continued massive Chinese investment in renewables, China emerged as
one of the leading producers of wind and solar power
technologies]{.underline}, and in certain segments of solar, wind, and
hydro energy, [it has also become an innovator and provider of
South--South and South--North technology transfer]{.underline} (Urban,
2018).

#### The CCP is critical to Chinese stability

[Since China\'s latest reform of Party and state institutions started in
early 2018, [the country has seen a systematic improvement of the
Party\'s leadership, the government\'s administrative capacity, the
armed forces\' combat capability and mass organizations\'
vitality]{.mark}]{.underline}. Xi Jinping, general secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Friday attended a
meeting reviewing the reform of Party and state institutions. Xi, also
Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission,
called for consolidating the achievements in the reform and modernizing
China\'s system and capacity for governance at the meeting. General
Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee Xi Jinping,
also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission,
delivers a speech while attending a meeting reviewing the reform of
Party and state institutions in Beijing, capital of China, July 5, 2019.
\[Photo/Xinhua\] In the reform at the central level and on state organs,
more than 80 departments underwent adjustment of their management,
frameworks, duties and personnel, with more than 1.8 million people
affected, according to official figures. The CPC Central Committee had
four coordinating organs removed while the State Council, China\'s
cabinet, had two removed. A total of 21 ministerial departments were
dissolved. Streamlining Governance The functions and structures of the
institutions were profoundly streamlined. The CPC Central Committee, the
National People\'s Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese
People\'s Political Consultative Conference optimized their layouts of
internal and subordinate departments. The State Council enhanced its
role in economic adjustment, market regulation, social management,
public service and environmental protection, with long-standing problems
of power overlap and segmentation solved. [Reform on this scale required
a meticulous plan and detailed maneuvers. One of the most complicated
cases of the reform was the forming of the Ministry of Emergency
Management, which integrated functions of 13 departments. The new
ministry was able to carry out its responsibilities round the clock in
response to emergencies even before its formal
inauguration]{.underline}. To address long-term problems such as the
absence of the proprietor of natural resources and overlapping
responsibilities, the Ministry of Natural Resources was established,
absorbing the functions of eight departments. Five administrative law
enforcement forces, introduced in the reform, integrated power from more
than 30 law enforcement fields, involving more than 1 million law
enforcement personnel. They helped settle the problems of repetitive law
enforcement and reduce inconvenience caused by law enforcement to the
public. More than 160 laws and 230 administrative regulations were
revised to facilitate the reform. Consolidating Party\'s Leadership
Through the reform, the systems to ensure the Party\'s overall
leadership and the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central
Committee have been further consolidated. [The central leading groups
for deepening overall reform, cyberspace affairs, financial and economic
affairs, and foreign affairs were upgraded into central committees while
two new central committees, for comprehensive law-based governance and
auditing, were formed. [The arrangements have enhanced the Party\'s
leadership over major works and its ability of decision-making and
coordination. The reform also reinforced the Party\'s absolute
leadership over the military through the restructuring of the armed
police]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### CCP is critical to both Chinese economic and political stability

[[In the four decades since Deng Xiaoping's reforms and opening up,
China has seen growth on a scale unparalleled in modern history. Where
hundreds of millions were once destitute, extreme poverty has been all
but cast into the annals of history; now, the world is competing to
attract the wealth of China's]{.mark} growing middle and upper
classes.]{.underline} Analyses of the country's explosive growth are
aplenty. [Real gross domestic product ([GDP) has grown 64-fold]{.mark},
literacy is above 95 per cent, and in a once Communist country, the
private sector, at least on paper, now accounts for 60 per cent of
economic activity. This article, however, will look more at the
country's stability, while analysing potential economic factors
underpinning it. A number of scholars predicted political and economic
instability as China rapidly became prosperous. But they seem to have
been proved wrong.]{.underline} [[The Chinese Community Party (CCP)
continues to enjoy high levels of popular legitimacy; this has been, and
will continue to be, critical in maintaining the country's progress. It
is likely that this legitimacy stems largely from two factors: mainly
economic growth, and the government's ability to respond to problems and
solve them]{.mark}. For decades, the central government has staked its
credibility on its ability to deliver prosperity to its people. It was a
good bet. Since Deng's "wealth is glorious" era, the party has shown
that its core focus is creating a society that is better off, with its
annual GDP growth targets being a good example. Indeed, scholars have
noted that a government can gain legitimacy, if there is a significant
increase in living standards. A middle class that believes its new-found
wealth is a direct consequence of the party's policies, and their
continuation is vital for further affluence, is likely to be satisfied
with the status quo.]{.underline} The government has also been adept at
using economic "rents" -- proceeds from highly profitable business
activities requiring minimal additional investment -- to redistribute
the benefits from growth. This provides ordinary people with a stake in
the party's continued rule, directly linking its power with economic
benefits. The state-owned sector still accounts for a large portion of
the economy and job market, creating more opportunities for such
distribution. But there are risks in banking on growth for legitimacy.
If China experiences a recession, or a similar economic shock, the
government's credibility could be badly undermined. That said, many
observers are confident that Beijing will be able to use its vast
reserves and monetary policies to absorb risk within the financial
system. With state guarantees, however, there is the risk of moral
hazard, so the situation is delicate: if people believe the government
will always bail them out should things go wrong, the incentive to
exercise caution is compromised. Separately, governments that do not
rely on an entirely democratic process can face challenges staying in
touch with the needs of their citizens. This can be dangerous. Simmering
discontent, particularly over tangible, daily issues like corruption and
bureaucratic mismanagement, can quickly boil over in a destabilising
way, as governments in the Middle East and other parts of the world
painfully found out. To its credit, the CCP has taken steps to ensure
that the daily woes -- harassment by officials, inability to access
basic services, and so on -- do not manifest themselves in broader
dissatisfaction against the political system. The party has established
watchdogs and complaints offices to tackle such issues. Chinese citizens
can also sue government agencies, and they do: more than 100,000 suits
have been filed, with academic Andrew Nathan claiming that success rates
can be as high as 40 per cent. Ultimately, the buck stops with the
central government. It must remain wary, but as long as it can ensure
that grievances can be addressed locally, there should be continued
stability. [[The party's sturdy foundations will help promote its rule.
Regimes are frequently imperiled by factionalism during leadership
transitions. The CCP, however, has laid out plans well in
advance]{.mark}, with minimal room for overt factional control. This has
severely diminished the opportunity for any individual, or a group, to
seize the reins of power in a way that could damage the party's
long-term prospects for a smooth transition.]{.underline} Since Deng's
"four transformations" in 1983, the party has made a concerted push
toward making meritocracy, not factional loyalty, the basis for
promotion. Together, these factors have helped create a strong morale
among party officials. Importantly, the country's civil service is also
more competent now. Some scholars argue that cultural factors have also
played a part in China's stability. The most relevant aspect is China's
historical grounding in Confucianism. Renowned political scholar Samuel
Huntington says that Confucianism, in its traditional form, emphasises
"authority over liberty", maintains that "individual rights were created
by the state", and "merged society and the state". Indeed, the central
government has shown a growing interest in promoting Confucian thought
and values in the country. In the past, the CCP once branded
Confucianism as a "feudal" ideology. Now, the party under Xi Jinping has
made lectures on Confucianism mandatory at the party's training academy
and has spearheaded a push for the teaching of Confucian values at
schools[. [China has enjoyed an envious combination of political growth
and economic stability]{.underline}]{.mark}[. This article only
scratches the surface of these issues, but hopefully provides an
instructive glimpse into how Beijing has managed to maintain
institutional solidarity and prove the doubters wrong]{.underline}.

#### CCP reforms are critical to maintain Chinese stability

[By reviewing existing debates on the connections between these three
collapses and China during the same period, we explain why these
collapses have not yet happened in China and assess their effects on
China's political and economic system[. First, we find that China was
able to avoid a Soviet-style collapse through a higher degree of
political consolidation, an economic structure that gives rise to market
oriented competitive enterprises, and a far more developed set of
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, China was able to avoid an
AFC-style financial crisis by keeping a closed capital account,
implementing prudent external financial policies, preventing yuan from
depreciating, and through fiscal stimulus. Third, China was able to
minimize the impact of the GFC through a 4-trillion-yuan stimulus plan,
though this plan, we note, has created other problems in the GFC's
aftermath. Taken as a whole, the gradual anti-crisis approach to reform
is the key policy framework through which China has been able to avoid
these three collapses. This policy framework has three properties that
combined serve as a firewall against major crises: gradualism, swift
anti-crisis targeting, and a high degree of autonomy in policy
adjustments. [Moreover, [the central government's control over social
resources makes]{.mark} 3 [it possible for Chinese authorities to
achieve these reform targets]{.mark}. Other countries may share some
features of China's approach to reform, but few are able to successfully
adopt the complete policy framework the Chinese government
uses.]{.underline} The gradual anti-crisis approach to reform is not
without cost, and it has in fact created the three biggest threats to
China's macroeconomic stabilities today. A growth slowdown, rising macro
debt level, and a booming housing market are partly the results of the
4-trillion-yuan stimulus package used to increase domestic demand after
the GFC. This stimulus package affected China's rebalancing process and
distorted its economic structure. However, according to the most recent
data and existing research, we argue that none of these aforementioned
threats will likely trigger an imminent crisis. In fact, we find that
there is still a window of time for Chinese officials to eliminate these
threats, but they must act quickly before risks build up. Political
disintegration is also a potential threat to China's overall stability.
[The propensity among China scholars is to cite the implosion of the
Soviet Union as an image of China's imminent future. [We find that this
analogy is flawed as it overlooks the key differences in the economic
and political structures of contemporary China and pre-1991 Russia.
Chinese policymakers were able to achieve a high degree of
centralization and institutionalization from the 1980s onwards, partly
in response to the implosion of their Soviet
neighbor]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This two-pronged approach of
centralization and institutionalization has enabled the CCP to contain
short-term shocks and promote longer-term stability, reflecting both the
rapid anti-crisis and gradual approaches to reform. Nevertheless, we
recognize that China today confronts more of the political and economic
problems that the Soviets faced pre-1991, in particular, foot-dragging
on reforms and rampant elite corruption. Since the 18th Party Congress
in 2012, [we find that the trend toward greater CCP control of both
party personnel and the economy suggests that China's authoritarian
resilience can be maintained at least over the next few
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} We also look at two potential new
instabilities in China's social-economic system. 4 The first one is the
feeling of anxiety and insecurity especially among China's new social
class---the middle class---which has caused higher capital outflows and
less private investment. The second one is increasing regional
inequalities and the potential for a regional economic collapse. [[These
latent instabilities and the existing threats we mentioned above have
both compelled Chinese authorities to maintain consistent communication
with the public about the party's reform agenda,]{.mark} rebuild the
incentive mechanism for local government officials, and ramp up the pace
of reforms. This paper intends to shed further light on studies of the
socialist system, economic transition, macroeconomic policies, and
institutional reforms. Both gradual and (rapid) anti-crisis approaches
to reform have been adopted by other countries]{.underline}. But we see
few examples of authorities comparing both approaches in their political
and economic reforms. China's growth experience over the past 40 years
shows the potential of this approach. In the meantime, this approach has
its own weaknesses, in the form of slow progress and a possible
overreaction to shocks

[On January 21, hundreds of senior [officials were summoned to the Party
School of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party]{.mark}
(CCP) [in Beijing for a special study session on national risk
control]{.mark}]{.underline}. These officials came from all crucial
organs of the state, the CCP, and the military across the country.
[Chinese President [Xi]{.mark} Jinping, who also holds the positions of
chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) --- the highest body
that controls China's military --- and general secretary of the CCP
Central Committee, presided over the opening ceremony of the study
session and made a formal speech. In his speech, he repeated [urged the
officials to "strengthen their ability in preventing major risks" so as
to "ensure social stability]{.mark}."]{.underline} According to Xinhua's
statement, Xi claimed that China now faces major risks in seven areas
--- politics, ideology, economy, science and technology, society, the
external environment, and Party building. ["[Faced with the turbulent
international situation, the complicated and sensitive external
environment, and our arduous task at hand is to maintain stability and
continue our reform]{.mark}. We must be on high alert over 'black swan'
events and 'gray rhino' risks]{.underline}," Xi said. "We must be able
to not only prevent risks, but also solve all challenges." [In financial
parlance, so-called "black swan" event refers to an occurrence that is
unlikely and unexpected but has dire consequences, while a "gray rhino"
risk is a threat that everyone sees coming but fails to
address]{.underline}. Since last year, both terms have become popular in
China. Multiple Chinese officials have mentioned these two problems on
various occasions --- not only in the financial sector but in a more
general sense, too. [On political and ideological risks, Xi [called on
the officials to "ensure China's political security" by "strengthening
the influence of the mainstream tone in public communication,"]{.mark}
"enhancing guidance on public opinion," "establishing a system for
integrated internet management," and "promoting a law-based cyberspace."
He particularly stressed that the ideological and political education
among the young generation should be strengthened.]{.underline} As The
Diplomat noted earlier, this year marks a series of either significant
or sensitive anniversaries --- for example, the 30th anniversary of the
crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Beijing is extremely
worried that a national crisis could take place at these critical
moments this year. Early this month, China's top internet censor --- the
Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) --- had already launched a new
round of internet crackdown, vowing to clean up all "negative and
harmful information" on the internet. [On economic risks, Xi [called for
"effective steps to stabilize employment, the financial market, foreign
trade, foreign investment, domestic investment and people's
expectations" in order to keep economic growth "within a reasonable
range.]{.mark}" Xi repeatedly used the term "struggle" in his latest
speech, calling to mind Cultural Revoultion-era rhetoric. He urged the
officials to "be courageous enough to struggle," improve their "ability
to struggle," and cultivate their "spirit of struggle." He even said
that "young cadres should go to the front line of major struggles with
real knives and guns."]{.underline} Notably, it was not the first time
that Xi has said such alarming remarks recently. [At the conference
celebrating the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up, Xi
told the 3,000 officials and foreign guests at the Great Hall of the
People that "we will face all kinds of risks and challenges in the
future and we may even encounter unimaginable terrifying tidal waves and
horrifying storms." At the "democratic life meeting" held in Beijing
last December, Xi said that upholding socialism in the new era is "a
great social revolution" and he spoke in various ways of struggling,
too.]{.underline}

The biggest problem here, as ever, is
[Taiwan](https://thediplomat.com/2017/03/what-happens-after-china-invades-taiwan/).
Maintaining Taiwan's democratic institutions and effective autonomy from
the mainland remains a core U.S. interest. And while Beijing's
territorial ambitions elsewhere in the region appear limited, its desire
to reincorporate Taiwan remains undiminished. **[[Chinese regional

confidence about Taiwan, and managing this issue peacefully will require
[important
compromises](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2011-03-01/will-chinas-rise-lead-war)
on both sides. American policymakers grappling with the strategic
dilemma presented by China's rise and recent assertive shift should
focus on signals of China's substantive preferences for East Asian
regional order. **[[China is clearly seeking to supplant the United
States as the]{.underline}]{.mark}** region's
**[[hegemon]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but **[[this is entirely consistent
with the behavior of an emerging great power]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
is largely satisfied with the status quo order. The United States
similarly expelled Great Britain from the Western Hemisphere after 1900,
but did not push on to invade Canada or [pilfer British
investments](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/roosevelt-and-monroe-doctrine)
throughout the region. [As an emerging great power, the United States
sought primarily to deny other powers the ability to threaten its
territory]{.underline}. Despite some disquietingly aggressive tactics,
**[[the substantive policies underlying China's assertive shift actually
seem quite compatible with American interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
China would establish effective control over most of the South and East
China Seas, and construct a set of economic institutions more favorable
to its interests. But China's policies have given little indication that
it harbors designs of broader territorial expansion or seeks to
fundamentally overthrow the liberal regional order. American strategy in
East Asia should be driven by these signals of China's substantive
preferences, not the fact that China is pursuing regional hegemony in
the first place.

#### China would maintain and Improve the SQ with hegemony

https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/chinas-rise-and-the-future-of-liberal-international-order-asking-the-right-questions/

What is new is the potentially dominant role played by an openly
illiberal state, which brings into open question the "liberal" component
of the liberal international order. It seems quite likely that **[[China
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** attempt to **[[maintain the legalistic
international economic system]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while refraining
from pursuit of its political counterpart. [There should be no doubt
that China will have a strong interest in maintaining some kind of
legalized economic order]{.underline}, or managing the existing order in
ways that benefit Beijing. The [question of intellectual
property](https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/chinas-progress-on-intellectual-property-rights-yes-really/)
brings this into stark relief. **[Much like the United States, an
underdeveloped China sought to acquire as much technology as possible
from more advanced foreign economies]{.underline}**. And much like the
United States, as domestic industries became more internationally
competitive, intellectual property law has become more rigorous. There
is no doubt that Chinese corporations with strong export profiles will
soon demand that Beijing protect their property abroad, and little doubt
that [**[China will establish and support multilateral means of ensuring
this protection]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Thus, Beijing has the profile
and interests of a state that will attempt to establish an international
order, and there is every reason to believe that this order will be at
least a loosely legalized one, **[[built upon modifications of the
existing order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Notably, even [under Xi Jinping,
China has NOT taken steps to disrupt the core tenets of the liberal
international order.]{.underline} It has not conducted disruptive
interventions of the politics of foreign countries (as has Russia), nor
rejected norms against territorial conquest (as has Russia). China has
chipped away at the margins, but these chips look very much more like a
reformist effort than either a revolutionary restructuring of the
international order, or a preference for watching the world burn.

#### Chinese Rise will be peaceful and beneficial 

**Xia 06** Ming Xia, 3-24-2006, \"\"China Threat\" or a \"Peaceful Rise
of China\"?,\" New York Times,

\"China\'s rise\" can be seen as a quintessentially political
process---through which the ruling Communist Party has sought to shore
up its legitimacy after the Cultural Revolution irreversibly changed the
nation and caused three crises of ideological belief, faith in the CPC,
and confidence in the future. As the Party realized that the
performance-based legitimacy was the only hope for prolonging its rule,
economic development became the highest politics. Consequentially, the
success of economic development would have to cause political
implications---the external ones are carefully monitored and evaluated
by China\'s neighbors and the only superpower of the world---the United
States. [Will China become a threat to the United States, Japan, and
surrounding countries? The reason for American concern mainly arises
from its hegemonic status in the world politics and the ideological
incompatibility of China with the Western value system. China\'s
stunning economic growth has convinced the West that it is just a matter
of time until China becomes a world superpower. But its ideological
orientation makes China a revolutionary power that is threatening both
to the United States\' status and global structure]{.underline}. Three
different logics have been constructed to substantiate the \"China
threat\" thesis. First, ideological and cultural factors make China a
threat. For neo-conservatives in the Bush Administration, the mere
factor that China still sticks to communism makes view it adversely.
Samuel Huntington has added a cultural factor: in the clash of
civilizations, the \"unholy alliance between Islamic and Confucian
civilizations\" is the most fundamental threat to the West. For people
using this logic, the sensible response from the U.S. is, in the short
run, a containment policy, and confrontation is possible if needed; in
the long run, the promotion of a peaceful transformation within China.
Second, geopolitical and geoeconomic factors. For many realists, even
China has shed off its ideological straitjacket, as a great power in
size (territory, population, and economy), China has to pursue its own
interest and respect. Nationalism may still drive China into a course of
clash with the United States, if the latter refuses to accommodate or
share the leadership with China as a rising power. Some scholars fear
that democracy can unleash strong nationalism and popular nationalism
can make China even more aggressive toward the United States. Third, the
collapse of China. Opposed to the previous two perspectives, some people
are concerned that if China suffers a Soviet-style sudden-death syndrome
and spins out of control, it can create an even worse scenario. The
sheer size of the population makes refuge problem, the failed state and
the followed crises (warlordism, civil war, crime, proliferation of
nuclear weapons, etc) impossible for the [world]{.underline} to deal
with. Due to these three different considerations, the United States
often oscillates from demonization to romaticization of China, from
containment to engagement. The U.S.-China relationship has shifted from
conflict, to confrontation, to competition and back to conflict, but so
rarely features with cooperation. One American China specialist
characterizes the bilateral relationship as \"the sweet-and-sour
Sino-American relationship.\" The Japanese have a different set of
reasons to feel upset by China\'s rise. Although Japan has been
culturally indebted to China since the Tang dynasty, somehow Japan has
developed a strong Oedipus complex toward China---namely to commit
patricide against its cultural patron. In the past century, China
suffered several severe acts of aggression at the hands of the Japanese.
The mutual animosity between these two countries has been strong. The
Japanese deep involvement in Taiwan, its stubborn refusal to offer
unequivocal apologies to the Asian neighboring countries over its
aggressions, and American military alliance with Japan all have been
irksome to the Chinese. The construction of Chinese nationalism by
mainly relying on anti-Japanese sentiment among the Chinese turned Japan
into an easy target. To some degree, the Chinese leadership has tried to
release the popular anger against the regime by directing it either to
the local tyrants or to the international bullies (U.S. and Japan are
two natural candidates). Now Japan and China still have not developed
any framework to resolve their territorial disputes and their
relationship has reached a low point. The Chinese often suspect that
U.S. and Japan are the originators of a variety of \"China threat\"
arguments. In addition to the ideological threat, many other neighboring
countries have more stakes in China\'s new move. For Southeast Asian
nations, the presence of a sizeable and extremely rich Chinese ethnic
group and their increasing dependency upon China\'s economy for growth
forced them to be very careful in handling their relationship with
China. With a continental size (China has almost two times the
territorial and population sizes of all other Asian Pacific countries
combined), China consumes a tremendous amount of foreign direct
investment and pops out huge volume of exports; other countries feel the
competition from China. At this moment, no government in the Asian
Pacific region has adopted a clear anti-China policy; but sporadic
anti-Chinese riots have occurred in Malaysia, Indonesia, the
Philippines; and strong resentment against the Northern economic and
cultural invasion has surfaced in Myanmar (former Burma), Thailand,
Vietnam, and other countries. Even Singapore---the self-proclaimed third
Chinese territory in addition to China and Taiwan---was upset by
China\'s strong hand in 2004 after Lee Hsien Loong, the
soon-to-be-inaugurated Prime Minister of Singapore, visited Taiwan. [The
combination of stunning economic growth and unpredictable political
governance causes deep concerns about China among the nations in the
world. The Chinese leadership has realized the urgency to calm down
these concerns and to build a supportive international environment for
its ascendancy. To make its rise less a threat, the Chinese government
has sponsored many PR events, such as exhibitions in foreign countries,
promoting Chinese language programs, and so on]{.underline}. But most
importantly, the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao put forward the thesis of
\"China\'s peaceful rise\" in his speech to a Harvard University
audience in December 2003. Under this thesis, there are several points:
First, [[China\'s development depends upon and in return will contribute
to the world peace; second, China will resort to peaceful means for
development; third, China\'s development will rely more on its own
resources and market; fourth, China is prepared for a long-term process
of hard work, even several generations, for economic prosperity.
Finally, even as China has achieved its economic development, it will
not seek hegemony in the world or come out as a threat to any
country.]{.mark} Under the guiding principle of \"[China\'s peaceful
rise,\" the Chinese government has conducted actively diplomacy at four
(at least) different levels: (1) Creating strategic partnerships with
the second-tier powers. China has signed strategic partnership treaties
with the EU, Russia and India to strengthen their relationships as well
as to balance the American power. (2) Promoting \"good neighbor policy\"
in the Asian Pacific region]{.mark}.]{.underline} By increasing trade
with the Asian-Pacific region and also let these countries enjoy trade
surplus with China, China has positioned as an important trading partner
with these countries. Besides, China has entered into various mechanisms
of regional cooperation with these countries. During the 1997 Asian
financial crises, that China refrained from devaluing its currency and
helped stabilize the regional economy by mobilizing its foreign currency
reserve won positive reactions from this region and the U.S. (**[[3)
Seeking cooperation and avoiding confrontation with the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The Chinese side basically has sent to
Washington a clear message that China is a conservative power and has no
intention to upset the status quo---namely the U.S. as the sole
superpower in the world. (4) Neglecting Japan. As China has successfully
managed relationships with the sole superpower, the second-tier
strategic partners, and neighboring countries, China is able to afford
to ignore Japan and occasionally show some toughness. [For the past five
years, the Chinese leadership has been cautious and successful in
managing the internal nationalism and American unilateralism, to some
degree, thanks to the anti-terror war. Now some signs have indicated
that the honeymoon between the U.S. and China in the aftermath of
Sept.11 attack and anti-terrorism coalition has arrived at its end. [If
the United States shifts its policy to a hard-line toward China, the
cyclical turbulence in the Sino-American relationship may soon
resurface.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This might jeopardize China\'s plan of
a peaceful]{.mark} [rise]{.mark}. At the micro-level, the U.S. seems to
have been more provocative toward China, the latter has been more on
defensive; but if we look at the Sino-U.S. relationship from the
macro-level, it seems that China can take back initiative if it can
remove the thorn of communist ideology and
authoritarianism]{.underline}, because the Americans tend to believe
that under the doctrine of democratic peace, democratic countries do not
fight war against each other. Therefore, to create long-term internal
and external stability, the CPC has to learn how to play the card of
democracy. Does this amount to ask a leopard to change its spots?

### 1NC\-\--indo-sino war

#### India wont go to war with china

Hugh **White**, 3-13-20**15**, Professor of Strategic Studies at the
Australian National University ,Sorry, America: [[India Won\'t Go to War
with China]{.underline}]{.mark}, National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/sorry-america-india-wont-go-war-china-12415,
accessed 10-17-2018 {\\\\EP}

In his [latest contribution to our
debate](http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2015/03/10/The-consequences-of-the-strengthening-US-India-parternship-still-uncertain.aspx)
, Shashank Joshi raised some excellent points against my skeptical view
of the emerging India-U.S. strategic partnership. But I\'m still
unpersuaded. To explain why, it helps to step back and clarify the
question we are debating here. It is not whether strategic relations
between Delhi and Washington have grown closer in recent years, because
clearly they have. It is what these closer relations mean for the
geo-political contest between America and China. [India\'s position is
clearly important to this contest. Many Americans, and many of
America\'s friends in Asia, have long believed that India\'s growing
wealth and power will be vital in helping America counterbalance
China\'s growing strategic weight, and resist China\'s challenge to U.S.
regional leadership.]{.underline} Indeed, the belief many people have
that India will play this role is central to their confidence that
America can and will preserve the status quo against China\'s challenge.
It is therefore important to decide whether the progress we have seen in
U.S.-India relations justifies that confidence. I have argued that in a
geopolitical contest of the kind we see unfolding between America and
China today, India\'s relations with America will only make a difference
to the extent that India is seen to be willing to support America in a
U.S.-China conflict. That is because who wins the contest between the
American and Chinese visions of Asia\'s future order ultimately depends
on which is seen to be more willing to fight for their vision. Each
power wants the other to believe that it will go to war to impose its
vision, and hopes that, if all else fails, this will persuade the other
to back off. This way of describing what is happening will surprise
those who think that this kind of old-fashioned power politics
disappeared after 1989, but it seems to me the only way to understand
events in Asia today. In fact, power politics never went away; people
simply started to think that America was the only power that was
indulging in it. It has been taken for granted that America will fight
to support its vision of regional order, but that no one would be
willing to oppose them. Now China is proving that false. We can no
longer assume that China isn't any more determined to change the current
order than America is to preserve it. [That is why India\'s role in this
contest depends on how far it appears willing and able to materially
support the U.S. in a conflict with China. In a game played for these
stakes, nothing less counts for much.]{.underline} As I read him,
Shashank makes two key points about this question. [One is that, while
I[ndia might not be willing to send combat forces to fight alongside
America\'s in a coalition against China]{.mark}]{.underline}, it would
provide other, non-combat support such as basing and refuelling
facilities. That sounds like what the diplomats call "all support short
of actual help." It would do very little either practically or
symbolically to bolster America\'s position against China, and certainly
much less than American boosters of the relationship expect. His second
key point is that perhaps India would be willing to provide America with
more substantial support if it saw really fundamental issues of regional
order at stake in a U.S.-China conflict. He cites the example of the
wide support given to America in opposing Iraq\'s invasion of Kuwait in
1990 by countries who saw basic questions of international order being
tested there. I agree with Shashank that very important issues for India
would be at stake in a U.S.-China clash. But deciding to support America
against China would be much harder than joining the coalition against
Iraq. In every way China is both a much more valuable partner and a much
more dangerous adversary. The key question for India, and for America\'s
other friends in Asia, is what would have to be at stake for them to
make that decision? [So it boils down to this: [would India go to war
with China to help America preserve the current order based on U.S.
primacy]{.mark}? [If the answer is no, then I don\'t think the new
warmth between America and India matters much to the future of Asia, and
America\'s position in Asia is rather weaker than most people
assume.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--indo-sino war

#### India wont go to war with china they wont be willing to send troops wont help America in a war with china- White 15

#### China and India wont go to war; more likely to be allies

Kieren **Underwood,** 8-19-20**17**,writer for the trumpet ,China and
India Won't Start a Big War Over Their Border Dispute, theTrumpet,
https://www.thetrumpet.com/16175-china-and-india-wont-start-a-big-war-over-their-border-dispute,
accessed 10-17-2018 {\\\\EP}

Among snow-capped mountains, the borders of China, India and Bhutan
meet. For the past two months, in a small plateau surrounded by those
mountains, a few hundred Chinese and Indian troops have faced each
other. They sit and wait, a few hundred feet apart. Both governments
have told the soldiers not to back down. The soldiers are there because
China decided to extend an unpaved road through the plateau on June 16.
Bhutan---a nation of only 800,000 people---claims the territory as its
own. China---a nation of 1.3 billion people---also claims it. India, the
third party, backs Bhutan's claim and is providing it with defense. [[So
far, it has been a war of words]{.mark}. India says it won't be pushed
around by China. China says "\[t\]he Indian military can choose to
return to its territory with dignity, or be kicked out of the area by
Chinese soldiers."]{.underline} On July 4, China's government-backed
Global Times published an editorial with the title: "India Will Suffer
Worse Losses Than 1962 If It Incites Border Clash." It was referring to
the border clash that occurred in a similar area in 1962. The Chinese
launched an offensive while the United States and Russia were distracted
with the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the single month of fighting, over
1,000 Indians were killed. "We firmly believe that the face-off in the
Donglang area will end up with the Indian troops in retreat," it said.
"This time, we must teach New Delhi a bitter lesson." International
media have taken the dispute seriously. Here are just a few of the
headlines. From the Sydney Morning Herald: "The China-India Clash That
Could Lead to Nuclear War." From the South China Morning Post: "China
and India Are Reportedly Preparing for Full-scale War Over a Himalayan
Border Dispute." From the DailyO: "China Wants War With India, Make No
Mistake." Understanding why China and India are so invested in this
border dispute requires a little knowledge of the region's geography.
China and India share a number of long borders with each other, but in
some ways, they are completely disconnected. As Geopolitical Future's
George Friedman put it, "The Himalayas separate them almost as much as
an ocean would. ... Sending and supplying major military forces into and
across the Himalayas is almost impossible." That's why the 1962 border
dispute lasted only a month. Mt. Everest is less than 125 miles away.
Many troops died, not because of weapons, but because of the freezing
cold. If there's a chance that either nation could set up shop beyond
the Himalayas, there's a chance that they could launch an offensive
without having to even cross them. So when China starts building a road
in Bhutan's claimed territory, India gets worried. There's also the
"Chicken Neck." This is what Indians call the thin strip of land---17
miles wide at its narrowest point---that connects its northeastern
states to the mainland. Over 45 million Indians live in the huge section
of land past the "Chicken Neck." It also contains the Brahmaputra River,
which runs all the way through Bangladesh and into the Indian Ocean. The
recent border standoff is close to the "Chicken Neck," and India wants
no chance of it being cut off. In all this, how close are India and
China to all-out war? "If China engages in a military offensive against
India, New Delhi will take all necessary measures," Dr. Rajeev Ranjan
Chaturvedy of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National
University of Singapore told the South China Morning Post. "Why only a
border war? It could escalate to a full-scale India-China war." When
Indian-Chinese scholar Jeff M. Smith was asked if he thought the
deadlock could devolve into war, he told the New York Times, "Yes I
do---and I don't say that lightly." The Trumpet views things
differently. Much of our analysis stems from the Bible-based predictions
of Herbert W. Armstrong published in his newsmagazine, the Plain Truth.
One of his most prominent forecasts was of a huge power bloc led by
Russia and China, called the "kings of the east." Other Asian nations
are likely to join this rising bloc. A February-March 1985 issue of the
Plain Truth told readers, "However it happens, Russia and Asian
neighbors will ultimately find themselves in some degree joining forces
out of necessity ..." (emphasis added). Our booklet [Russia and China in
Prophecy](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1266-russia-and-china-in-prophecy)
says: "India---with its population of more than 1.2 billion people---is
almost certain to join the Asian bloc that is prophesied to congeal in
the end time." With this in mind, the Trumpet can tell its readers that,
in the end, [[China and India will almost surely put aside their
differences and border disputes to cooperate on bigger tasks]{.mark}.
Perhaps this border dispute will erupt into clashes like those of 1962.
In the very short term, anything is possible. Beyond that, [whether it
be an alliance of convenience, or a symptom of the slowly-growing
economic ties, India and China will be allies]{.mark}. [Don't expect
China and India to start a big war over this border crisis. When they
are involved in war, they likely will be on the same
side.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### No Escalation\-\--China

#### China won't escalate\-\--official statements

Tom **O\'Connor, 18**, 6-19-2018, \"China says it \"cannot stand\"
another conflict with India\",
\[https://www.newsweek.com/china-says-it-cannot-afford-another-conflict-india-985033\],

[**[China\'s ambassador to India]{.mark} has [warned]{.mark} that the
[strained ties]{.mark} between the two nations [would not be able to
sustain a sequel]{.mark}** to last summer\'s border conflict, which
threatened to bring the two Asia powers to blows.]{.underline} Luo
Zhaohui, the Chinese envoy, made the remarks Monday as part of an appeal
to better relations between the countries, which have cautiously
improved since a two-month standoff erupted between Chinese and Indian
forces posted at a region known to the former as Donglang and to the
latter as Doklam and claimed by both China and Bhutan, an ally of India.
Chinese construction near the border rattled India, whose soldiers were
mobilized and at one point brawled with their Chinese counterparts. No
shots were fired, however, and [Chinese President [Xi]{.mark} Jinping
[and]{.mark} Indian Prime Minister Narendra [Modi]{.mark} have
[attempted to keep the peace after]{.mark} ultimately
[withdrawing]{.mark} their [forces]{.mark} in August]{.underline}. Luo
said \"[[a]{.mark} mutually [acceptable solution\" would have]{.mark} to
be found [to ensure such a boundary]{.mark} dispute did not repeat
itself, according to The Economic Times.]{.underline} \"[[We need to
control]{.mark}, manage, narrow [differences]{.mark} through expanding
cooperation. The boundary question was left over by history. We need to
find a mutual acceptable solution through Special Representatives\'
Meeting while adopting confidence-building measures]{.underline},\" he
added. \"[[We cannot stand another Doklam]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Border
disputes between China and India previously exploded into a brief war in
the 1960s, but both sides have expressed a willingness to de-escalate
the current situation. [Still, both Indian and Chinese officials have
bickered over the conclusion of the 2017 standoff in Doklam or Donglang,
a region bordering China\'s Tibet, India\'s Sikkim and Bhutan\'s Haa
Valley.]{.underline} Shortly after two Indian generals appeared in
January to claim victory in last summer\'s bout, China\'s Communist
Party newspaper The Global Times threatened \"harsh punishment from the
Chinese army.\" The ongoing enmity has been exacerbated by China\'s
close military relationship with India\'s top rival, Pakistan. India and
Pakistan were partitioned in 1947 and their volatile relationship has
produced several wars and another ongoing border conflict over the
region of Kashmir. In recent years, China has accelerated bilateral
military drills with Pakistan and has touted the majority-Muslim South
Asian state as a part of Xi\'s One Belt, One Road initiative to boost
trade across Asia and beyond. During his address Monday, [[Luo called
for a]{.mark} trilateral [meeting]{.mark} between China, India and
Pakistan in order [to resolve]{.mark} ongoing [hostilities]{.mark}. The
diplomat claimed \"some Indian friends\" of his were behind the idea and
that he supported it as \"very constructive.\"]{.underline} India\'s
Ministry of External Affairs, however, shot down the idea, with
spokesperson Raveesh Kumar denying that any official proposal for such a
three-way dialogue had been received by the Indian government. \"We have
seen reports on comments made by the Chinese ambassador in this
matter,\" Kumar said in a statement. \"[**[We have not received
any]{.mark} such [suggestion from the Chinese]{.mark} government**. We
consider the statement as the personal opinion of the Ambassador.
Matters related to India-Pakistan relations are purely bilateral in
nature and have no scope for involvement of any third
country]{.underline}.\"

### No Escalation\-\--Hotline

#### New hotline stops Indo-Sino escalation

[New [Delhi and Beijing]{.mark} on Thursday [agreed to]{.mark}
\'work-towards\' **[a fresh defence exchange and cooperation agreement
and also a hotline]{.mark}** to connect the two armies. The defence
exchange and cooperation understanding will replace the 2006
agreement.]{.underline} These were decided when Defence Minister of
India Nirmala Sitharaman met her counterpart General Wei Fenghe, State
Councilor and Defence Minister of People\'s Republic of China. A
24-member delegation of the Chinese Defence Ministry is visiting India.
The decision to rework the 2006 agreement reflects greater understanding
of each other to manage the 3,488 Km long undemarcated Line of Actual
Control - the de-facto boundary between the two countries often
described as the most disputed and yet most peaceful. EXCHANGE AND
COOPERATION The details of the new Memorandum of Understanding for
exchange and cooperation in the field of defence will now be worked out
by the officials on both sides, senior Ministry of Defence officials
said. [Importantly, [both]{.mark} New Delhi and Beijing [agreed that
issues like the]{.mark} Doklam [stand-off should be resolved through
discussion]{.mark} keeping in mind the concerns of both
sides.]{.underline} The agreement to sort border disputes through
interaction and discussion flows from the historic meeting between
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Modi in Wuhan, China
earlier this year. After a tense 73 day long-stand-off between the two
armies in the Doklam Plateau in Bhutan, Prime Minister Modi and
President Xi Jinping had met at Wuhan for an informal summit leading to
normalisation of relations between the two countries. HOTLINE TO CONNECT
TWO ARMIES Significantly, [[a hotline to connect the two armies was
agreed upon]{.mark}.]{.underline} India Today had earlier reported about
a decision to connect two armies through a hotline. India has proposed
that the senior leadership of the two armies - Director General of
Military Operations (DGMO) and his equivalent in the Chinese PLA to be
connected through the hotline. China, sources said, has suggested more
than one hotline. It has suggested the commander of the Western Theatre
Command of PLA be connected to Eastern Army and Northern Army Commander
of the Indian Army. The Western Theatre Command of the PLA is tasked to
protect the borders with India. \"The ministers also discussed issues
relating to the border areas[. [It was agreed to work towards]{.mark}
full [implementation of ongoing confidence building]{.mark} measures [as
well greater]{.mark} interaction of at the working level to ensure
maintenance of [peace and tranquility]{.mark}, including
operationalisation of Hotline between the relevant departments of their
armed forces,\" a statement issued by New Delhi said.]{.underline}
BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND BUILDING TRUST Hotlines already exists between
field level commanders are used to sort of local difference. [[A
**hotline connecting** ]{.mark}**the senior [military
leadership]{.mark}, it is hoped, [will lead to]{.mark} better
understanding and building of [trust between the two
armies.]{.mark}**]{.underline} India also took up new electrification
and water projects along the LAC. China, didn\'t object to such projects
but underlined that such projects shouldn\'t harm its interests, source
said.

### No Indo-Sino War

AVD

Chinese Defence Minister Wei [[Fenghe and]{.mark} Indian Prime Minister
Narendra [Modi vowed to maintain a peaceful border as the]{.mark}
militaries of the [two]{.mark} countries continue to work to [repair
their relationship]{.mark}.]{.underline} Wei, who is also a general in
the People's Liberation Army, told [Modi during a visit to New Delhi
that friendly **[cooperation]{.mark} had [become the main component of
China and India's inter-military relations]{.mark}**, the Chinese
defence ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday.]{.underline} It
was the first visit by a Chinese military leader since last year's
stand-off on the Himalayan border between the two countries. "This visit
... will deepen our bilateral military exchanges and cooperation on
security, enhance mutual trust and push forward the new development of
our military ties to protect peace on the border," Wei said. Modi
praised the "[thousands of years of friendship" between [India and
China,]{.mark} saying his previous [meetings]{.mark} with Chinese
President Xi Jinping had [resulted in good
relations.]{.mark}]{.underline} Wei will also meet Indian Defence
Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, to further discuss security and stability
on the border, the statement said. Between June and August last year,
hundreds of Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in a months-long
military confrontation in Doklam, an area claimed by both China and
India's ally Bhutan, as India strongly objected to China's construction
of a road there. [It was the most serious confrontation between the two
countries since the Sino-India border war in 1962, igniting fears of
another military conflict between the world's two most populous
nations.]{.underline} After 73 days and lots of backstage negotiations
the two sides agreed to withdraw their soldiers from the front line. But
the Chinese army engineers later carried on construction on the Doklam
plateau, and in addition to new roads, had built some new infrastructure
including sentry posts, trenches and helipads near the site, Sitharaman
said earlier this year. Wei's meeting with Sitharaman would focus on
managing potential crises in the future, and looking for ways to improve
stability on the border, said Sun Shihai, expert on South Asian studies
at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "[There has been a
long-existing deficit of trust between the two militaries]{.underline},"
he said. "[[A direct contact]{.mark} between two military leaders could
g[reatly improve the situation on the front line and **reduce**
]{.mark}**border-crossings and [confrontations]{.mark}**, which have
been numerous over the years]{.underline}." The distrust has led to
India's concerns over Chinese construction in the Himalayas. The fear is
that Chinese troops from this high ground would be able to threaten
Indian military positions in the Siliguri corridor, also known as the
fragile "Chicken's Neck" of India which connects its northeastern states
with the rest of the country. The two countries have been trying to
repair ties since last year's incident and relations have continued to
improve. Modi has been to China three times over the past year,
attending summits in Xiamen and Qingdao, as well as unofficially meeting
with Xi in Wuhan. They are expected to meet again in Argentina on the
Apec sidelines later this year. "**[[The top leaders have reached
consensus not to]{.mark} have a similar [incident hurt ties
again]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Sun said. "[So the two [defence
ministers]{.mark} will probably [discuss]{.mark} programmes such as
[joint exercises]{.mark}, personnel training exchanges, [or]{.mark} just
[friendly get-together events]{.mark} between the border
troops]{.underline}."

#### No Indo-Sino war\-\--agreements and dialogue

**PTI** Beijing, **18**, 11-15-2018, \"Top India, China officials meet,

A year after the Doklam stand-off, top defence officials of [[India and
China]{.mark} have [agreed on]{.mark} the importance of [maintaining
peace in the border areas]{.mark} while implementing the consensus
reached between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at
Wuhan.]{.underline} The ninth annual Defence and Security Dialogue on
November 13 was held over a year after the 73-day military stand-off in
the Sikkim sector. The talks were held between the two defence
delegations headed by Defence Secretary Sanjay Mitra and China's Deputy
Chief of Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission Lt
General Shao Yuanming, a press release by the Indian Embassy here said
on Thursday. Asked about the outcome of the defence and security
dialogue, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the
two sides have exchanged ideas on the management of border affairs and
upholding peace and tranquillity. "We believe the two sides will try to
follow the consensus between the two leaders to ensure peace and
tranquillity at our border areas and ensure stability of our bilateral
ties," she said. At the talks, [[both sides agreed on enhancing defence
exchanges and interactions]{.mark} at different levels [between the two
militaries]{.mark}]{.underline}, the press release said. After the
talks, Mitra called on Chinese State Councillor and Defence Minister
General Wei Fenghe on Wednesday, the release said. Mitra was accompanied
by senior officials of the ministry of defence and Indian Army, Navy and
Air Force. [The annual dialogue did not take place last year following
the tense stand-off between the two armies at Doklam, which was
triggered by the Chinese PLA's plan to build a road close to the narrow
Chicken's Neck corridor connecting India's northeastern states in an
area also claimed by Bhutan and China.]{.underline} The stand-off ended
when Chinese troops stopped the road construction after which both
countries stepped up efforts to normalise relations leading to the
informal summit between Modi and Xi at Wuhan in April this year. The
defence dialogue was also held ahead of the 21st round of border talks
between the Special Representatives of the two countries in the Chinese
