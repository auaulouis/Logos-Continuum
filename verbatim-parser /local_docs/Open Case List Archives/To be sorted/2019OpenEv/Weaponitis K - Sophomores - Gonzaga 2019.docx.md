### 1NC K -- Weaponitis

#### Their focus on weapons as the object of analysis serves to mystify responsibility and naturalize militarism and violence -- undermines their reformist potential and legitimates war and imperialism

[Novel though it may be, [the re-siting of agency]{.mark} taking place
at the heart of the RMA [does not]{.mark} [bring subjectivity fully into
view]{.mark}.]{.underline} Claims made on behalf of PGMs have yet to go
so far as to suggest that the weapons decide on the terms of their own
use -- though the crucial role of those who actually despatch them is
mystified, it is not denied. [Key to how imaginaries founded in and
sustained by briefing videos and like ([re)presentations]{.mark}
depoliticize war, then, is that the effect has been to **[cast weapons
as agents]{.mark}**, but without completing the anthropomorphic turn
that would inscribe them also as sites of ethical responsibility.
However, this does not merely imply a bifurcation of the subject, the
sum of which is nevertheless as visible as divisible. Rather, the
severed whole has become something less than the sum of its parts in the
alienation of the purposive subject from the operant site of agency: a
crucial element of whole subjectivity is lost to the extent that [a deep
ambivalence about responsibility is engendered]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
cruise missile, it should be remembered, intends nothing. Our gaze is
therefore fixed on a weapon-agent that can be no more than a grammatical
subject separated from ethical subjecthood in what appears at first as a
profoundly depoliticizing move. But more than this, the mystified site
of ethical subjecthood is insulated from responsibility for any dire
consequences that might be visited upon noncombatants. Read through the
imaginaries of the RMA, such events become the exceptions in which
something has gone awry. '[[Responsibility']{.mark} consequently
[lacks]{.mark} for [an intelligible tether]{.mark} to either the
weapon-agent or the fragmented subjectivity associated with it, [but
does]{.mark} not fully [become]{.mark} a [free floating]{.mark}
signifier [since it may yet plausibly attach to the
victims]{.mark}]{.underline}.15

Although turned to a more progressive purpose, the rhetorical/discursive
strategies of the landmine ban effect and work through a similar
disturbance of sites of responsibility. The success of the mine ban
movement owes in no small measure to the marking of antipersonnel
landmines as 'bad' weapons -- a move that has enabled even states that
have widely used mines to join in denouncing them as a humanitarian
scourge without simultaneously repudiating recourse to militarized
violence more generally. At the campaign level and with the specific
practical objective of securing the broadest possible ban on landmines,
this was a very well conceived approach. Indeed, had this strategy not
been adopted, it is unlikely that the movement would have swayed many --
if any -- states to the cause. But practically expedient though it may
be, it is also contingent on putting responsibility out of sight. Like
errant cruise missiles, landmines intend nothing. What makes them bad,
then, speaks not of disposition, but rather a technological limitation
resulting in an objective property of indiscriminacy. While this might
at first seem suggestive of the need for a technological solution, the
mine ban movement quite rightly worked to foreclose the possibility of
recourse to 'smart mines' in deference to the goal of a complete
prohibition. This would appear to mark it quite decidedly apart from the
war- enabling technologies of the RMA and their part in refashioning the
bases of legitimacy in contemporary warfare. [[Tfhe mystification of
responsibility so crucial to the ban]{.mark}, however, [reveals some
disturbing points of intersection]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On first gloss, the approach of the mine ban movement seems quite
clearly to disavow any recourse to 'better' technology as a fix for
landmine indiscriminacy. The importance of this cannot be overstated
since, as has been the case with the RMA, [[**distinguishing between
'good' and 'bad' weapons raises the specter of a like distinction in
terms of the conduct of those who use** them]{.mark} -- a distinction
not always well sustained by the actual consequences of their
use]{.underline}. In refusing to concede that some mines might be less
pernicious than others, therefore, the movement has simultaneously
denied all bases of legitimacy in mine use that might otherwise have
been claimed by the technologically advantaged. But things become rather
more problematic when considered from without the narrow context of the
landmines issue. While the rhetorical casting of mines as bad proved a
remarkably effective strategy in pursuit of a ban, [[it only makes sense
if it]{.mark} in fact [*is* imagined that there are somewhere 'good'
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since it is not killing per se but killing
with landmines that is rendered indefensible, the use of other
presumably more discriminating weapons is lent a certain legitimacy it
might not otherwise have enjoyed. And this is revealing of the important
sense in which the core claims of the mine ban contribute to the
reproduction of essential ideational bases of the 'new American way of
war.' Inviting none of the cynicism about motives that might have
attached to a wholly **[[state-led initiative]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the central involvement of civil society actors in the mine ban movement
-- well known and respected peace and human rights advocacy groups among
them -- [both [naturalizes and valorizes a]{.mark} much **[larger
constellation of claims to meaningful discriminacy]{.mark}**, whether
overt or subsumed]{.underline}.

Pressing for a ban on landmines thus involved the complete
disaggregation of this one issue not only from peace activism in general
but from the more particular realm of disarmament advocacy as well,
parceling it off in such a way as to suggest that there are more
effective ways to do the sorts of things landmines are intended to do.
Although the success of the campaign is often tied to the support given
it by the late Princess of Wales, that really speaks more to its public
face and the winning of popular opinion. Much more important in making
the case to states was a group of retired high-ranking US military
officers -- including General Norman Schwarzkopf -- who backed the ban
on grounds that landmines, besides resulting in unintended dire human
consequences, were no longer appropriate to contemporary warfare and
could even frustrate its prosecution; other weapons, they argued, could
do the job much more effectively.16 Espoused by the general who came to
international fame alongside Gulf War briefing videos, this position is
inseparable from popular imaginaries about PGMs and surgical strikes --
indeed, its very intelligibility owes to them. [And while it would
certainly be too much to suggest that unequally shifting arbiters of
legitimacy in war are sustained by this form of disarmament
advocacy]{.underline}, the mine ban movement's foregrounding of the dire
human consequences of indiscriminacy nevertheless merges neatly with the
imaginaries of the RMA. In combination with this, the movement's
enthusiastic endorsement of Schwarzkopf's position is telling of the
post-political frame in which efforts to ban landmines have been
confined.

As Žižek (1999) describes it, [[post-politics is]{.mark}, in essence,
[the obliteration of the political through the reduction of the overall
demand of a particular group to just that demand]{.mark}. That is to
say, [it is the reduction of]{.mark} a call for [better]{.mark} working
[conditions]{.mark}, for example, [to that very specific issue
alone]{.mark}, divesting it of its politicized content as part of a
broader push for social justice and [therefore]{.mark} also [divesting
it of]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark}]{.underline} to, as Žižek (1999:
204) puts it, 'function as a metaphoric condensation
of\...opposition\...so that the protest is no longer actually just about
that demand, but about the universal dimension that resonates in that
particular demand.' This is key to an understanding of politics as
something more than 'administration of social matters' -- for Žižek
(1999: 199; emphasis in original), 'the political act (intervention)
proper is not simply something that exists well within the framework of
the existing relations, but something that changes the very framework
that determines how things work.' Post-politics takes place within the
status quo framework, containing particular demands -- even to the
extent of answering them -- in such a way as to prevent their
'metaphoric universalization' (Žižek: 204). The rhetorical/discursive
disaggregation of landmines from state practices of organized violence
more broadly finds it on just such a post-political terrain, severing at
least this particular exercise of disarmament advocacy from any appeal
against militarism writ large. [The central validity claims of the ban,
having cast landmines as the agents of dire human consequences, also
divorce it from appeals against the killing of noncombatants with other
weapons]{.underline}, including errant PGMs.

Conclusion: Disarming Politics At base, the essence of the case advanced
by the movement to ban them was that antipersonnel landmines are bad
weapons because they do not discriminate -- that is the position that
ultimately accounts for the remarkable success of the campaign to ban
them. [But [the idea of bad weapons, as opposed to bad practices,
has]{.mark} some [important implications and effects]{.mark}. First, and
most fundamentally, it confines disarmament advocacy to a decidedly
post-political terrain of engagement whereon [it is possible to imagine
a ban]{.mark}]{.underline} [on landmines]{.underline} [**[without in any
way disturbing]{.mark} the [militarized practices]{.mark}** that led to
the circumstance that there are presently more than a hundred million
mines lying in wait in conflict- and post-conflict zones around the
world. Indeed, [militarized practices are not only moved off the
critical agenda, but are actually reinforced]{.mark} to the extent that
the crux of the case turns on the idea that landmines are problematic
for their unintended consequences. [That has the effect of reconfirming
as legitimate both their **intended effects** and the **broader
purposes** they had been intended to serve]{.mark} by those effects. The
demand that landmines be banned is therefore reduced to just that
particular demand. And perhaps the best indication of this is that the
movement has been unable to parlay its success with landmines into a
much hoped-for ban on small arms and light weapons.]{.underline}

But what is perhaps the most troubling implication of the mine ban
rhetoric follows from this: **[[agency is shifted to weapons
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}** in casting landmines [as 'bad' and as
the site of responsibility for the dire human consequences that have
been associated with them]{.underline}. That mystifies the site of
responsibility such that when a 'good' weapon -- a cruise missile, for
example -- hits other than its intended target questions about
responsibility stop at the weapon itself and can be resolved by pointing
to a malfunction. [In this way, **[responsibility is contained and
managed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The broader significance of the shifting
of agency toward weapons comes more fully to light via the rhetorics of
the RMA and the imaginaries it sustains: in particular, well popularized
understandings of smart bombs and surgical strikes. The whole discourse
of 'smart bombs' also ascribes individualized agency to weapons. That
they are not actually smart matters little when popular imaginaries take
at face value the discursive and aesthetic renderings together with
attending rhetorics. [In instances of implausibly deniable 'collateral
damage' the weapon is at fault because it has been rendered an
autonomous agent. Similarly placing blame for dire human consequences on
weapons, mine ban rhetoric upholds the viability of this]{.underline}.
In common with the landmines taboo, the new American way of war turns
also on the matter of meaningful discrimination between combatants and
noncombatants and of who, or, more precisely, what fails to
discriminate. All that is unique, important, and laudable about the
Ottawa Process raises urgent questions about disarmament advocacy. What
seems clear is that the rhetorical/discursive and aesthetic renderings
of the RMA are key to understanding both the successes and the limits of
the campaign to ban landmines and, with it, something of the future of
disarmament advocacy more broadly. The extent to which it stands as a
workable model for future initiatives would seem to be contingent upon
the degree to which its success owes to the nexus between a re- emergent
discriminacy norm and the advent of weapon-agents. As the frustrated
hopes for a follow-on success in the area of small arms and light
weapons suggest, this might not be easily replicable. In any event, it
would seem to fix quite restrictive limits on the range of weapons that
might be singled out for prohibition, whilst ironically depopulating war
once more by objectifying victims and confounding the easy
identification of whole subject positions whence issue the injuring
practices of war.

[Confined to a post-political terrain of engagement, [the]{.mark} most
[profound limitation]{.mark}]{.underline} of the approach taken in the
landmine ban **[[resides in the forfeiture of any thoroughgoing critique
of militarized practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As noted above, it is
probably too much to say that the mine ban movement's adoption of
weapon-agent discursive strategies played any significant part in
preparing the ideational ground for the sanitized rhetorics of
discriminacy in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is, however, implicated in the
very imaginaries that sustain those rhetorics and may, no less, have
been enabled by them. Besides [[mystifying sites of agency and
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}, this undergirds claims to
meaningful discriminacy that [[have become an increasingly important
part of **cultivating legitimacy in recourse to
war**]{.underline}]{.mark}. What is more, it also effectively abandons
those bodies marked as combatants, unlawful or otherwise. And while it
is widely accepted that combatants, by virtue of their direct
participation in Clausewitz's 'other means,' enjoy no special right of
protection, this may be to lose sight once more of the ineluctable fact
of war's embeddedness in broader socio-political contexts and practices.
It is imperative, from this perspective, to bear in mind that the
ascription 'combatant' may be no less socially and politically
contingent than that of 'unlawful combatant.' We are thus enjoined to
consider the significance of conscription and the unequal social
determinants characteristic and enabling of much recruitment. These are
just some of the thornier implications of undertaking efforts toward
disarmament on the terms of the RMA and new ways of war -- implications
that call for careful reflection on the fundamental values and ultimate
objectives of activist and advocacy work in this important area. Such
are the disarming politics of our moment.

A post-civilization [analysis can no longer permit an intellectual
amnesia within the field of arms control]{.underline} and disarmament. A
post-civilization [analysis is to be premised on [a compelling need to
**acknowledge the** **colonial inheritance**]{.mark} of the practices of
arms control and disarmament. This need [can be met with]{.mark} the
help of contrapuntal [analysis of]{.mark} the problem of [weapons
regulation and prohibition]{.mark}]{.underline}. A post-civilization
analysis, unlike a civilization discourse, will [demand linkages of time
and space that are not merely evolutionary in their [progressive
accounting of]{.mark} the problem of [arms control]{.mark} and
disarmament. A post-civilization analysis is respectful of particular
historical experiences that [engender a politics of fear]{.mark},
vulnerability, humiliation, and resentment [without polarizing the
experiences and the differences in the **stigmatizing equation of West

affects and the demands for justice in arms control and
disarmament]{.underline}. A post-civilization approach will help us
grasp how [[the 'colonial origins of the discipline are re-enacted
whenever the discipline attempts to]{.mark} renew itself, **[reform
itself']{.mark}**]{.underline}.148 [It is this [understanding]{.mark}
and engagement that [will empower practices of arms control]{.mark} and
disarmament [to articulate creative resistance instead of being a
silent, complicit hostage contributing to doomsday predictions]{.mark}
of an impending inter-civilization conflict]{.underline}.

### Link -- general "weapons"

#### Opposition to specific arms sales sanitizes militarism because it relies on the same discourse -- tactical reforms affirm the larger security paradigm

and Processes of Securitization: Moving Weapons Along the Security
Continuum* in [Reconceptualising Arms Control: Controlling the Means of
Violence]{.underline}, ed. Cooper & Mutimer)

Fourth, [the success of [campaigns]{.mark} on landmines [and]{.mark}
cluster munitions]{.underline} [demonstrates how '[moments of
intervention']{.mark} undertaken on behalf of the voiceless]{.underline}
by supposedly weak securitizing actors such as NGOs [can,]{.underline}
nevertheless[, [produce]{.mark} quite **[effective
securitizations]{.mark}** - in this case, the [**hyper-securitization**
of]{.mark} particular **[weapons]{.mark}** technologies]{.underline}.
Both campaigns also highlighted the ways in which actors can utilize
media images and, through survivor activism that extended to the
conference room, provide a context for the body to speak security.
[[Moreover]{.mark}, the [success of these campaigns highlights]{.mark}
the ways in which [the language of threat]{.mark}, [survival]{.mark},
and security can be deployed to achieve positive security
outcomes]{.underline}. [At the same time however]{.underline}, the
[success of the **humanitarian arms control agenda**]{.underline} around
landmines and cluster munitions in particular [was only achieved because
NGOs adopted **exactly [the same discourse]{.mark}** [around]{.mark}
humanitarianism, human security and [weapons]{.mark} precision that [has
been **deployed to legitimize**]{.mark} post-Cold War **liberal peace
[interventionism]{.mark}** and in the marketing of new weapons
developments.]{.underline} On one reading, this might point to the
potential for actors to deploy dominant forms of security speech in
order to achieve progressive ends. On a more pessimistic reading
however, [it]{.underline} also **[highlights the profound limits
involved in such approaches]{.underline}**. [To the extent that the
extra-securitization of pariah technologies]{.underline} such as
landmines [has **facilitated the relative desecuritization of major
conventional weapons transfers**]{.underline} [it has]{.underline} also
[made the current framework of control look like an example of **ethical
advance**]{.underline} [at the same time as creating space for the
**deproblematization of arms transfers in general**]{.underline}.
Ultimately then, [the moments of intervention represented by the
[campaigns]{.mark} on landmines and cluster munitions [were successful
because they did not threaten, and in many ways were **quite consistent
with, the dominant security paradigm**]{.mark}]{.underline} and security
narratives of the post-Cold War era. Equally, whilst the regularized
routines and working practices of the security professionals of the
export licensing process are certainly important in understanding the
treatment of defence transfers, this body of professionals were
themselves, brought into being as a result of historical changes in the
fundamental assumptions about security and economy. Moreover, their veiy
working practices and modes of behaviour are currently being altered as
a result of similar fundamental shifts in the paradigms of security and
economy which, in turn, are a function of particular combinations of
power and interest. Although these shifts certainly predated the
post-Cold War era, they have become particularly concretized in this
era. One consequence of all this is that a loud [**ethical
[discourse]{.mark}** [around the restriction of]{.mark}]{.underline}
landmines, cluster munitions, and [[small arms has gone hand in hand
with]{.mark} recent **[rises in]{.mark} both [global military
expenditure and]{.mark} arms [transfers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For
example, overall, world defence expenditure in 2008 was estimated to be
\$1,464 billion (of which NATO countries accounted for 60 per cent and
OECD countries 72 per cent) representing a 45 per cent increase in real
terms since 1999,93 whilst global arms sales were 22 per cent higher in
real terms for the period 2005-2009 than for the preceding period
2000-2004.94 Moreover, largely because of the dominance of American and
European defence spending, the defence trade is increasingly
concentrated in the hands of the United States and to a lesser extent,
European companies. For example, in 2006 American and European companies
accounted for an estimated 92.7 per cent of the arms sales of the
world's 100 largest defence companies.95 Most [arms trade NGOs have
largely neglected issues such as the **rises in defence
expenditure**]{.underline} in major weapons states such as the United
States, [intra-northern trade in arms]{.underline}, [and the dominant
role played by Western companies in the arms trade, in favour of an
agenda that **conceives the South**]{.underline} - **[and in particular
pariah actors in sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline}** - [as the **primary
object** of conventional arms trade regulation]{.underline}.96 With
regard to transfers of small arms and major conventional weapons it
might be argued that this, at least, also requires impressive
self-abnegation from arms trade profits on the part of powerful states
in the international system. In practice however, international
initiatives such as the EU Code or the Wassennaar Arrangement, national
**[export regulations]{.underline}** [of the major weapons
states]{.underline} and the local initiatives of client states mostly
[combine to produce a **cartography of prohibition**]{.underline} [that
corresponds more closely with the **disciplinary geographies** advocated
by the powerful rather than any **global map of militarism and
injustice**. One illustration]{.underline} of this [is the way in
which]{.underline} a recent review of [British defence export
legislation downgraded long-range missiles]{.underline} and the 'heroic'
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV - the Maxim gun of modern imperial wars)
from a categoiy A classification (goods such as cluster munitions whose
supply is prohibited) to the less restrictive categoiy B,97
[whilst]{.underline} in 2010, [the Afghan government proscribed the
import, use, and sale of Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer]{.underline}
because it is one of the elements [used in the making of
IEDs]{.underline}.98 More generally, as one recent econometric analysis
of major weapons transfers from the Britain, France, Germany, and the
United States concluded, despite much rhetoric about the need for a more
ethical approach to arms sales from governments in all these countries:
Neither human rights abuses nor autocratic polity would appear to reduce
the likelihood of countries receiving Western arms, or reduce the
relative share of a particular exporter's weapons they receive. In fact,
human rights abusing countries are actually more likely to receive
weapons from the US, while autocratic regimes emerge as more likely
recipients of weaponry from France and the UK.99 Of course, arms trade
NGOs have often been the first to highlight such hypocrisies and the
work of most organizations include, to a greater or lesser extent,
elements of critique or advocacy that might be considered
transformational. However, [one of the principle features of arms trade
activism]{.underline} in the post-Cold War era [is the extent to which
many NGOs have **downgraded radical critique** in exchange for insider
influence and government funding]{.underline}.100 Instead, [[activism
has largely been aimed at promoting **tactical reform**]{.underline}
[within an overarching]{.underline}]{.mark} [**economic and [security\'
paradigm]{.mark}** [that **justifies intervention**]{.mark}, regulation,
and transformation of the South whilst]{.underline} (with the exception
of token action on landmines, etc.) **[[leaving the vast accumulation of
Western armaments largely unproblematized]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
logic of this analysis then, is that [there needs to be a far greater
problematization of military expenditure by the major powers, of the
so-called 'legitimate' trade in defence goods]{.underline}, including
intra-Northern trade, [and a [problematization]{.mark} of the
predominance of Western defence companies in global arms
markets]{.underline}. In short, [campaigners [needs to return to a
**strategic contestation of global militarism** rather than searching
for **tactical**]{.mark} **campaign [victories]{.mark} dependent on
accommodation with the language and economic and security paradigms of
contemporary military humanism**]{.underline}.

Arms Trade Regulation and the Security Problematique

If neoliberalism has facilitated a more permissive approach to arms
transfer regulation then this raises the question of [why any limits
have been introduced]{.underline} at all? As already noted above, one
part of the answer is rooted in the [[relationship between legitimized
and heroic weapons]{.mark} and those military technologies that lie
outside the boundaries of the heroic and the legitimized.]{.underline}
Being the 'other' of legitimized military technology [[facilitates
successful problematization]{.underline}]{.mark} and indeed
'extra-securitisation'. Additionally however, the [architecture of
global arms trade regulation has been transformed]{.underline} in the
post-Cold War era along with the transformation in the objects of
security that [accompanied the end of the Cold War]{.underline}.
[[During the Cold War, the global architecture]{.underline}]{.mark} of
conventional arms trade regulation, like arms control more generally,
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} principally [[focussed on]{.mark} managing
[East--West tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}. One consequence was [a
substantial extension of the range of dual-use goods invested with
security labels in relation to trade with Eastern Europe]{.underline},
most manifest in debates in the early 1950s between the United States
and European states over the operation of CoCoM (Coordinating Committee
for Multilateral Export Controls).85 In contrast, [[the developing world
was]{.mark} merely [an object of]{.mark} security [competition
between]{.mark} the [superpowers]{.mark}]{.underline} and therefore a
site for the supply of arms to allies. [With [the dissolution of the
Soviet]{.mark} threat the focus has [turned more]{.mark} [to the
management of North--South relations]{.mark} as [the developing world
has been]{.mark} [reconstructed as]{.mark} the source of diverse
[security threats]{.mark}]{.underline}[8]{.mark}6 and as humanitarian
intervention has resurrected similar concerns with the maintenance of
order in the developing world that animated the arms restrictions in the
Brussels Act. One manifestation of this has been in the reframing of
small arms as instruments of disorder rather than the means to shore up
Cold War allies. A further example is the replacement of the CoCom
regime with the Wasennaar Arrangement, focussed particularly on
restricting transfers to pariah regimes in the global South. This shift
in focus is also manifest in the signiﬁcant rise in the use of arms
embargoes in the post-Cold War era. [For example, between 1945 and 1990
only two mandatory embargoes were imposed globally, on Rhodesia and
Africa,]{.underline} respectively. [Since the 1990s]{.underline} there
have been two voluntary and 27 mandatory cases of
[sanctions]{.underline}, the vast majority of which [have been aimed
at]{.underline} [actors in Africa]{.underline}.87 Sanctions, just like
the [[efforts to control arms]{.underline}]{.mark} to Africa in the late
19th century have not been hugely successful in reducing the supply of
weapons to combatants. Nevertheless, they [[can be
understood]{.underline}]{.mark} as animated by much the same desire [[to
maintain order]{.mark} in the peripheries of the world, [particularly in
a context where Western powers have]{.mark} once again [taken]{.mark} on
[a]{.mark} [greater responsibility for]{.mark} policing and [managing
instability in the developing world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [the
post-Cold War regulation of the conventional arms trade is]{.underline}
simultaneously characterized by a relatively more permissive approach to
arms transfers in general but also a redirection of controls away from
[the [governance]{.underline}]{.mark} of East-- West relations and
towards the governance [[of North--South relations]{.mark} and
[particularly]{.mark} the disciplining of those [actors framed as
rogue]{.mark} or pariah in the security narratives of dominant
actors]{.underline}. The campaign to promote an arms trade treaty may
yet produce a more meaningful architecture of arms transfer control --
the jury is out. However the framing of the Arms Trade Treaty to the
defence industry is perhaps instructive. For example, the UK's
Ambassador for Multilateral Arms Control has noted, the ATT '\...is
about \...[[export controls]{.mark} that will [stop]{.mark} [weapons
ending up in the hands of terrorists]{.mark}, insurgents, violent
criminal gangs, or in the hands of dictators'.88 It should also be noted
that current efforts to develop a global agreement on the arms trade
[echo late 19thth]{.mark} [and early 20thth century
initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline} to govern the international arms trade,
most notably: the Brussels Act, the 1919 St Germain Convention for the
Control of the Trade in Arms and Ammunition, and the 1925 Arms Trafﬁc
Convention. Although the latter two never received the necessary
ratiﬁcations to come into force both were [[animated by]{.mark} the same
[imperial concern to prevent disorder]{.mark} in the
colonies]{.underline} that had underpinned the Brussels Act. As Stone
has noted with regards to the St Germain convention for example, 'there
was little doubt among representatives in Paris \[where the Convention
was signed\] that keeping arms out of African and Asian hands was St
Germain's chief task'.89 Accordingly, the convention imposed far
stricter restrictions on sales to these areas as well as a ban on arms
shipments to 'any country which refuses to accept the tutelage under
which it has been placed'.90 Indeed, although the convention never came
into being, European powers nevertheless agreed informally to carry out
its provisions in Africa and the Middle East.91 The 1925 convention
similarly imposed more severe restrictions on exports to special zones
that covered most of Africa and parts of what had been the Ottoman
Empire.92 Thus, view**[ed against this broader history of [arms
regulation]{.mark}, negotiations on a putative Arms Trade Treaty (rather
[like action on APMs or cluster munitions]{.mark}) do not represent a
novel post-Cold War development that symbolizes progress on an
emancipatory human security agenda consonant with the promotion of local
and global peace. Instead, it [reﬂects the emergence of]{.mark}
particular sets of [relationships between power, interest, economy,
security, and]{.mark} legitimized [military technologies that]{.mark} in
turn [create the conditions of emergence for historically contingent
architectures of global regulation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

However, whilst it is important (if only to counter the pessimistic
discourse surrounding this issue) to recognise the various disarmament
outcomes that have been generated under the current arms limitation
system, it is also important to recognise the context in which these
have occurred. In particular, both disarmament and broader [arms
limitation initiatives are now taking place as part of an asymmetrical
arms limitation system that has replaced the emphasis on balance between
the superpowers that dominated Cold War practice.]{.underline}34

It is sufficient at this juncture to note that [what characterizes this
system of arms limitation is the way]{.underline} in which [it is
structured to consolidate and preserve the military superiority of the
US]{.underline} in particular and the West in general. Moreover, [rather
than reinforcing security this profound military imbalance promotes
insecurity]{.underline} -- both by creating incentives for other actors
to pursue asymmetric technologies (NBC) or strategies (terrorism) that
offset the US's conventional superiority,35 and by diverting resources
that could be expended on human security to militarism. At best, [the
contemporary arms limitation system aims to keep the lid on such
contradictions by setting in place a variety of disciplinary mechanisms
that attempt to constrain asymmetric military responses whilst
simultaneously preserving the asymmetrical advantages of the West. At
worst, in attempting to contain pressures that may ultimately be
uncontainable, the contemporary arms limitation system may promote an
illusion of relative security whilst positively fostering a variety of
insecurities.]{.underline} However, a few more comments are in order
before we proceed to consider this system of asymmetrical arms
limitation in more detail. Stuart Croft and arms control as threat
construction

The corollary of the preceding critique of arms control theory is of
course a requirement to develop conceptual frameworks (and framings)
that are capable of simultaneously challenging the hegemonic discourse
within the discipline and of producing greater explanatory value. To
date this attempt has been most convincingly pursued by critical
theorists and postmodernists such as Mutimer,36 and Krause and Latham.37
Even within the mainstream literature on arms limitation however, there
has been some attempt to reconceptualise arms limitation practice. Most
notably, Stuart Croft in Strategies of Arms Control explicitly rejects
the distinction between arms control and disarmament as a basis for
framing discussions of arms limitation.38 Instead he develops a typology
based around five different strategies of arms control: arms control at
the conclusion of major conflicts, arms control to strengthen strategic
stability, arms control to create norms of behaviour, arms control to
manage the proliferation of weapons and arms control by international
organisation. This certainly represents an improvement on more
traditional discussions of arms limitation. However, there are also a
number of problems with his analysis. First, Croft locates his typology
in a broader analysis that emphasises the idea that arms control as an
activity has been constantly widening (in the sense that there has been
a gradual accretion of strategies deployed to achieve it) and that arms
control agreements have become ever 'deeper' (in the sense that
agreements have become more detailed, arrangements for verification have
become both more common and more sophisticated, and the likelihood of
agreements taking on the qualities of a regime have increased).
Consequently, although Croft states that he is determined to avoid
making judgements on the success or failure of arms control both as
theory and practice, he nevertheless manages to produce a profoundly
teleological (and indeed optimistic) account of the history of arms
control/arms limitation. However, there has not been a straightforward
accretion of arms limitation activity. Partly this is because [the
relevance of many arms control agreements has simply declined with the
advent of new military technology.]{.underline} But even where this has
not been the case, [politics and power have constantly intruded both to
kill off arms limitation initiatives and to influence their
depth.]{.underline} Examples include Japanese and German disarmament
after the Second World War, and the US decision to renounce the ABM
Treaty. Similarly, the two page SORT Treaty highlights how the
inexorable increase in depth described by Croft in 1996 was, at best, a
function of historically contingent Cold War practices rather than some
evolutionary manifest destiny.39 Second, Croft states that investigation
of the motivation for arms limitation is outside the remit of his book.
Despite noting the influence of politics and power on arms limitation
then, what Croft presents is a largely mechanistic and apolitical
analysis of the subject. Indeed, the development of arms limitation
practice is depicted as an essentially autonomous process -- as if, to
paraphrase Cox, arms limitation were not always for some purpose and for
someone.40 This is not untypical of the majority of the literature in
this field which tends to focus on the technical minutiae of military
strategy, diplomatic texts or policy battles. The problems that arms
limitation deals with are generally taken as given and the purpose of
such activity (just like arms control theory itself) is to engage in
producing 'problemsolving' solutions to these issues. What Croft, and
[mainstream arms controllers]{.underline} in general
[ignore]{.underline}, is [the role that arms limitation activity plays
in both reflecting broader constructions of threat and in reinforcing
them.]{.underline} Moreover, whilst the idea that arms limitation
represents an arena where political power is exercised is taken as
axiomatic, [power is generally understood to be expressed in the
relations between states]{.underline} (or internal bureaucracies)
[negotiating]{.underline} (or sometimes imposing) specific treaties,
[and measured in terms of who wins or loses in these negotiations. The
myriad ways in which hegemonic power is expressed through developments
in the dominant modes of arms limitation thinking and practice rarely
intrude.]{.underline} For example, [the power expressed as a result of
the role played by discourse and action over arms limitation in
affirming hegemonic projects of securitisation; the power manifested in
the specific ways in which the system of arms limitation contributes to
maintaining particular military and social hierarchies]{.underline}
whether internally, within the state, or throughout the global system;
[and the relationship between the interests of power and the ways in
which arms limitation reflects and reinforces powerful political,
economic and cultural tools of legitimation]{.underline}/delegitimation
[surrounding military technology.]{.underline}

In other words (from a critical security studies perspective at least),
[the key questions surrounding arms limitation are not so much who wins
or loses in negotiations over a specific treaty or how
effective/ineffective that treaty turns out to be.]{.underline} Rather,
[the principal concern is with how the dominant discourse and practice
of arms limitation]{.underline} (not always the same thing) [contributes
to processes of securitisation and othering as well as military and
broader hegemonic practices.]{.underline}

### Link -- democracy

#### Under liberal democratic models, peace exists and can be enforced through military actions, but in reality, these models only continue discourse and provide more reasons for the state to commit acts of violence.

Foucault and Derrida both provide comprehensive theorizations of agonism
and violence. Frazer and Hutchings (2011) identify two key shared themes
that are relevant to the present argument. First, contexts of government
are contexts of violence. [As has been demonstrated, Foucault and
Derrida both examine the **violence inherent in the law and the state**.
Second, both critique the disavowal of violence -- philosophical and
modern [claims to **peace are exposed as masking hidden
violence**]{.mark} (Frazer and Hutchings, 2011).]{.underline} These key
theoretical points disrupt common notions of peaceful, law-abiding,
societies. [Agonistic perspectives have particularly been critical of
the 'liberal democratic' model of peace. Emerging from the Enlightenment
(Joas, 2003), and the thought of Immanuel Kant (see Kant, 2009), this
model is based on the idea that [peace **derives** from **ordered,
law-abiding republican states**]{.mark}, precisely [those]{.mark}
phenomena [that are]{.mark} revealed as **[violent]{.mark}** in the
theories of Foucault and Derrida. Under the liberal model, [peace
is]{.mark} something that can paradoxically be [enforced by **military
intervention**]{.mark} (Joas, 2003). Drawing upon Foucault's analysis of
the relation between biopolitics and war, Dillon and Reid (2009)
elaborate upon this central paradox: despite posing itself as a means to
reduce war, [liberalism]{.mark} in fact [produces **more reasons to go
to war**]{.mark}. Following Foucault, they claim that the justification
for liberal warfare is to 'make life live', and indeed proclaim that the
['**liberal peace becomes the extension of war by other means**']{.mark}
(p. 129).]{.underline}

In light of this, some have argued the merits of the agonistic approach
to peace. Shinko (2008) argues that agonism is useful precisely because
it destabilizes any version of peace based on consensus. It avoids
notions of peace falling into 'hegemonic iterations of disciplinary
order' (Shinko, 2008: 475). She argues that the task for an agonistic
approach is to 'locate structural inequities \... \[and\] identify the
power resources that have held and continue to hold them in place' (p.
491). Likewise, Polat (2010) contends that we must be suspicious of
every narrative of peace as 'a privileged manifestation of power,
hegemonic and violent' (p. 339). Within geography, Ross (2011) similarly
draws attention to the need to destabilize those versions of peace that
'support the hegemony of the status quo' (p. 198) and suppress efforts
to combat inequality. She posits that we must 'recognise the violence in
the purported peace' (p. 198). The parallel between this argument and
Foucault's claim that we need to address the 'war beneath peace' is
apparent, and exemplifies the often easy slippage between struggle and
violence in characterizations of politics as negotiated difference.
These arguments are also in line with Popke's (2003) declaration that a
post-structuralist ethics in geography must involve a 'politics of
deconstruction' (p. 311) so as to question the ways in which identities
are naturalized, and to investigate how 'spatial boundaries and
divisions have been used to draw distinctions between self and other'
(p. 311).

[This is a project that critical political geography is already doing
'to interpret the **[war]{.mark} that [is going on beneath
peace]{.mark}'** (Foucault, 2004: 51). Gregory (2007), for instance,
exposes the way that the law functioned as an aid to warfare in the Bush
administration; '**[law and violence are not opposed but hold each other
in a deadly embrace']{.mark}** (p. 211). Olund (2007) examines how [US
governmental discourse of cosmopolitanism has **justified** their
**foreign military interventions**]{.mark}. Graham (2006) has shown how
the ostensibly positive connotations of 'homeland' cities are complicit
in the killing of the 'other' against which they are defined. Kirsch and
Flint's (2011) edited collection aims to 'better understand how
processes of war, and relations of power shaped through war, are indeed
embedded in the peace' (pp. 3--4).]{.underline} Even Brickell (2015),
who situates her paper, like Darling (2014) quoted at the outset, within
the call for wider geographies of peace than geopolitics, predominantly
demonstrates how local Cambodian reconciliation measures for domestic
abuse can trap women in a violent marriage. [In all, [concepts that
might]{.mark} ordinarily [be associated with peace]{.mark} ([law
and]{.mark} order, [cosmopolitanism]{.mark}, a sense of home/identity,
reconciliation) [are revealed as **masking agonal operations**,
and]{.mark} even **[violence]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

All of these are important and necessary interventions. A
deconstructionist approach is 'perpetually relevant' (Dittmer, 2015:
669) in critical geopolitics and critical geography more generally.
However, such projects struggle to offer any positive conceptualization
of peace and the plurality of engagements making up peaceful practices,
precisely because sociality and its necessary politics is based on
conflict or even violence. What is peace and how can we recognize it, if
sociality is only agonistic, or if violent difference constitutes and
delimits the contingency of the sayable? Critique -- as the reflexive
analysis of difference within the phenomenological limits of what is
sayable and knowable -- itself becomes increasingly unable to account
for ontological aspects of human (and non-human) political agency, like
love, compassion, empathy, non-harmful cooperation, and nurture. As a
result, important disciplinary fields like critical geopolitics, and
political geographies more widely, fail to address adequately the range
and spirit of theoretical and political possibilities open to them.
[[Deadlock remains, between **impossible peace and unavoidable
violence**]{.mark}, and so an affirmative project for studying the
heterogeneity of peace as a constitutive or productive capacity in human
interaction is not formed. [It is not able to be formed because]{.mark}
critique is predicated on 'reading \... **[the persistence of violence
in apparently peaceful relations of care and conviviality]{.mark}**'
(Darling, 2014: 237).]{.underline} Extant geographies of the predicates
of peace -- those actual forces of love, care, and conviviality that
materially innervate, in everyday practice, rationales for justice --
become processes that go underrecognized, under-theorized, and perhaps
even under-theorizable in their diverse, positive manifestations.

### Link -- ethics advantages

#### All policies are to preserve the face of the West, but these policies, such as disarmament and proliferation cause violence.

**Mathur** Assistant professor of Department of Political Science and
Geography at UTSA. **'14** \[Ritu. 16 Oct 2014. *Taylor & Francis

Control and Disarmament?"

This framework of analysis also insists on a standard manoeuvre towards
'othering mass slaughter from the West and from modernity. [[It serves
to preserve]{.mark}, in the face of any evidence to the contrary, **[the
ethical character of the West]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}, in turn, underpins
claims in liberal and security studies [that the **West is a force for
the good in the world'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}56

According to Barkawi and Laffey, '**[[conventional security studies as a
field of knowledge is a product of Western
power]{.mark}']{.underline}**. As a result, it

\... produces basic difficulties in understanding the course and nature
of events, that is, in empirical analyses, of security studies. Whether
we wish to understand crisis decision-making or the cause of genocide,
adopting a Eurocentric set of assumptions -- about agency, objectivity,
and morality -- gets in the way and hinders our efforts. [Second,
[Eurocentrism in security studies]{.mark} also [means that]{.mark}
analysis winds up expressing a **taken for [granted politics]{.mark}**
that [sides with]{.mark} the **[rulers]{.mark}**, with [the
**powerful**]{.mark}, with [the **imperialists**, and **not
with**]{.mark} the **downtrodden**, [the **weak**, the **colonized** or
the **post-colonised**]{.mark} \... This means [there is both a **social
science**]{.mark} **problem [and]{.mark} a [political
problem]{.mark}**.]{.underline}57

In an effort to address these problems, it is important to pause here
and take note of the observations being made by scholars championing
civilizational discourses on the one hand and postcolonial scholars who
are critiquing practices shaping Western security culture on the other.
[The scholars championing civilizational discourses are caught in the
midst of configuring the possibilities of a universal civilization
making marginal references to technological differences and **[weapons
proliferations]{.mark}** that they suggest can **[generate
inter-civilizational violence]{.mark}**. On the other hand, critical
security studies and postcolonial scholars seek to bring centre-stage
the very language, categories, and experiences that have produced and
reproduced our understanding of [arms control and disarmament]{.mark} as
an exercise in modernity and [a **civilizing
mission**]{.mark}.]{.underline} I take note of these differences but
learning from Cox's suggestion of the need for empathy and Barkawi and
Laffey's concern for difficulties in undertaking empirical analyses to
investigate the relations between the West and the Rest, I proceed in
the next section to undertake a contrapuntal analysis of the integral
relations that have existed between the West and the Rest with regard to
weapons regulation and prohibition. This analysis is constrained due to
the limitations of presenting it in a journal article but does serve to
whet one's appetite for more empirical research along these lines in the
field of arms control and disarmament.

#### USFG's justifications of morality and risk assessment serve only to legitimize Western militarism without changing unjust practices

**Stavrianakis 16** \[Anna, 1/8/16, Third World Quarterly "Legitimising
liberal militarism: politics, law and war in the Arms Trade Treaty",
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01436597.2015.1113867>, accessed 7/5/2019,
DL\]\
The [[US government's claims t]{.mark}o universalism, responsibility and
[morality]{.mark}]{.underline}, meanwhile, [were more unilateralist and
interest-based in character. Its delegation [was]{.mark} much more
[explicit about bringing the rest of world up to its 'responsible'
standards for 'legitimate' transfers]{.mark},69 [with its system]{.mark}
understood [as 'the "gold standard]{.mark}" of export
controls']{.underline}.70 The ATT would serve as a 'trifecta' of peace,
security and human rights for the USA.71 [[US arms transfers are carried
out]{.mark} for 'one main reason: [to further US national security
interests']{.mark} -- they are 'an unequivocal signal to those who seek
to counter US interests or undermine international norms'.72 This
alignment of US interests with international norms serves to elide the
empirical patterns identified earlier and there is a clear political
move at stake,]{.underline} which is much more acceptable in US
political speech than in British: 'the [regulatory elegance of export
control systems aside, it is the arms transfer policies of governments
that matter most']{.underline}.73

In January 2014 the White House announced the first Presidential Policy
Directive on conventional arms transfer policy since 1995. While 'the
importance of protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights hasn't
changed', it needed to be 'more prominently reflected'.74 A norms-based
argument might argue that the fact the US government feels the need to
reflect it more prominently is a positive effect of the ATT. But [[the
government was simultaneously clear that the ATT **will make no
difference to its practice**]{.mark}, and has been enacting an Export
Control Initiative that further streamlines export
licensing.]{.underline} In this, 'less sensitive' items will be moved to
a Commerce Control List away from a Military List, putting 'higher
fences round fewer items' but also leading to less statutory involvement
of Congress in decision making and a re-categorisation of lists
primarily based on military threats to the USA, 'diminishing the ability
to use the controls to deny exports to human rights abusers'.75

A focus on two specific cases -- arms transfers to Egypt during the Arab
Spring, and intra-Western transfers for use in liberal wars of choice --
illustrates the argument in more detail. [[Discourses of risk have been
embedded into arms trade regulation, yet]{.mark} the continuities in
US--UK practice suggest that [they serve a primarily legitimating
purpose]{.mark}. The [risk assessment]{.mark} process [**allows liberal
states to continue preparing for war and supporting war-making
institutions**, capitalist development and restricted forms of politics
overseas, **and simultaneously to claim the mantle of morality**]{.mark}
and responsibility. Krause identifies a logic of governmentality in arms
control, in which forms of regulation burrow deep into the domestic
politics of states. Accompanying this has been a 'normative evolution'
around 'who could legitimately use what kinds of violence against which
people or groups and under what circumstances]{.underline}."76 While
there are indeed increasingly complex and bureaucratised processes of
risk management around arms transfer regulation, [this [supposed
normative evolution has not restrained historically long-standing
patterns of liberal use of violence against non- liberal societies, nor
support for violence in the non-European world.]{.mark} While the
burgeoning literature on risk 'has shifted security away from the
register of war and violence',77 [the incorporation of risk into arms
trade regulation is better understood in terms of **the maintenance of
the legitimacy of war in the West**.]{.mark}]{.underline}78 This is not
to say that modes of control have not been changing in recent decades:
the shift to democracy promotion since the 1980s may generate 'a more
resilient form of social control than authoritarian and dictatorial
rule',79 and capitalism has long featured combinations of consensual and
coercive modes of rule.

### Link -- human rights

#### The plan legitimates the broader systems it intends to change -- human rights becomes a justification for militarism

[These [empirical patterns raise the question of how liberal states
manage to both transfer weapons to human rights violating]{.mark} and
authoritarian [regimes, and claim the mantle of
responsibility]{.mark}]{.underline} by being publicly in favour of the
ATT. The [empirical [studies]{.mark} cited above [tend to adopt a
realist explanation]{.mark}, in which seemingly normatively progressive
regimes serve as rhetorical cover for material or strategic
interests]{.underline},36 [yet they do not go into detail as to how that
process works. [Realist explanations are inadequate because they fail to
take into account the]{.mark} hard [work that such rhetoric
performs]{.mark} or the way that regimes function, often
[despite]{.mark} the [good intention]{.mark} of some
proponents]{.underline}.37 Law and regulation are not merely superficial
cover, a distraction from a focus on the advancement of material
interests: [[law 'does matter]{.mark}; that is both the problem and the
promise']{.underline}.38 Thus while constructivists are right that
rationalist assumptions of narrowly instrumental behaviour are false,39
they do not give an adequate explanation of the significance of the
morally oriented work that is going on in the ATT: the ways in [which [a
seemingly progressive initiative contains the seeds of its own
complicity in broader systems of preparation for war and
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} yet Price does point to how,
'[if hypocrisy becomes too endemic then it may undercut the power of the
moral legitimacy more generally that is required for hypocrisy's
piggy-back effects'.40 So it may be that [arms transfers are so embedded
in hypocrisy that normative shaming is less
effective]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As Erickson argues, 'the ATT
faces a hard road ahead': 'without the means to expose and punish
noncompliance... \[ambitious policies\] do little more than enhance
states' reputations without improving human rights and conflict
conditions on the ground'.41 yet 'Research explaining major suppliers'
support for "responsible" arms export controls is lacking'.42 To start
thinking about this gap between commitment and compliance, and to
explain major suppliers' positions, I advance the concept of liberal
militarism. This moves beyond arguments based on hypocrisy and
instrumental or functional pursuit of material interests, in order to
explain key effects of the treaty in ways other approaches cannot. The
normalisation and legitimation of liberal ways of war and war
preparation via the ATT are an important component of contemporary
militarism.

The concept of militarism, understood as the social and international
relations of the preparation for, and conduct of, organised political
violence,43 allows us to examine the historical, socioeconomic and
political sources and character of military power.44 Understood this
way, the concept goes beyond a definition of militarism as ideology, and
of militarisation as the material process through which militarism comes
about. [Militarism includes an ideological component]{.underline} but is
not restricted to it, [because [war and armed violence can be justified
and facilitated even if not necessarily glorified]{.mark}; and because
[social forces beyond ideology are required to produce it.]{.mark} Arms
transfers and [arms transfer control may thus contribute
to]{.mark}]{.underline} militarisation (an increase in the intensity of
military power in society, whether domestic or international),
demilitarisation (a decrease), [or [a change in the character of
militarism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The concept allows for the analysis of
the different forms across space and time taken by war and preparation
for it.45 And [while the number of deaths caused by the arms trade is
clearly an important yardstick, [a militarism frame]{.mark} goes beyond
numbers.]{.underline} Rather, [it [captures the influence of military
relations on social relations in general, and the ways that war and
armed violence are prepared for.]{.mark} [This requires broadening the
empirical focus beyond conflict in Africa and organised crime in Latin
America]{.mark}, which have been the main focus of arms transfer
control.]{.underline}

Scholars are increasingly challenging the long- and widely cherished
belief that liberalism and militarism are antithetical.46 [Key features
of the specificity of liberal militarism include: the capital- and
technology-intensive character of the preparation for and conduct of
war; a strong commitment to military production across war- and
peacetime and self-understanding as a primarily 'economic, industrial
and commercial power']{.underline}; the distanced form of attacks on
Southern populations and simultaneous containment of social conflict at
home and policing of empire abroad, often featuring supposedly 'small'
massacres; a universalist ideology and conception of world order; low
levels of military participation by society; and a state--capital
relation that is formally separate but organically related.47
[[Justifications based on values and morals promoting human rights and
humanitarian values are central to legitimating these features of
liberal militarism]{.mark}, and are in contrast to the justifications
based on sovereignty of other major, non-liberal suppliers and
recipients such as Russia, China and India]{.underline}. In the case of
the ATT, [[language and regulatory bureaucratic practices of risk
assessment are embedded in Western, liberal regimes]{.mark} that on
paper already exceed the standards set out in the ATT]{.underline}.

More generally the turn to law has been central to the development of
liberal militarism. [The laws of war serve [a legitimising effect for
Western ways of war, pre-empting criticism through reassurance,
shielding acts and practices from criticism, and giving rhetorical
protection from challenge,]{.mark} which [serves to naturalise and
normalise the prevailing distribution of power.]{.mark}48 And the
combination of [human rights]{.mark} and IHL [has served to criminalise
lowtech violence and legitimate high-tech forms of war.]{.mark}49 The
[turn to law is 'productive of the]{.mark} social and political [context
that makes possible certain forms of war]{.mark} and certain relations
of hierarchy', [as]{.mark} the '[perceived compliance with the
law]{.mark} itself [is partly productive of the global order in which
contemporary war occurs']{.mark}.50 [This allows liberal states to pitch
their practice in terms of responsibility, morality and
legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} overall, then, while it is
inappropriate to claim that legal regimes are mere instruments of the
powerful, it is also too strong to say that humanitarian security
regimes such as the ATT operate 'in opposition to the aspirations of the
most powerful states'.51 [What is at stake]{.underline}, rather, [is the
legitimation of specific forms of war fighting and war
preparation]{.underline}.

#### Humanitarian justifications for arms control solidify boundary between legitimate and illegitimate violence but do nothing to challenge it 

**Krause, PhD, 12**

(Keith, IR@Geneva, *Leashing the Dogs of War: Arms Control from
Sovereignty to Governmentality* in [Reconceptualising Arms Control:
Controlling the Means of Violence]{.underline}, ed. Cooper & Mutimer)

The second element of continuity was that [arms control measures often
had a]{.underline} sort of **[humanitarian subtext]{.underline}**, [that
echoed earlier restrictions on the civilized use of
weapons,]{.underline} [such as the banning]{.underline} at the Second
Lateran council [of the use of crossbows against
Christians]{.underline}, or the general opprobrium that greeted the
spread of firearms on the battlefield. [From the]{.underline} 1899 and
1907 [Hague conferences]{.underline}, on forward to the debate around
dum-dum bullets and chemical weapons in the first half of the 20th
century, [to contemporary debates on land mines, cluster munitions
and]{.underline} the treaty on Certain Conventional Weapons
([CCW]{.underline}), **[particular tropes]{.underline}** [concerning

people [have been deployed]{.underline}.10 These include such things as
the ban on chemical weapons, on blinding lasers, and on anti-personnel
landmines. [This]{.underline} humanitarian [subtext]{.underline} to most
of these measures [was an important part of the **civilizing discourse
of warfare**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} was therefore [also part of
the broader **devil's bargain** of international humanitarian
law.]{.underline} The principle of international humanitarian law,
[which protects some groups]{.underline} of people [from some forms of
weapons]{.underline} or violence, [may also have made certain forms of
interstate war-fighting **more palatable or acceptable**]{.underline},
[rather than **challenging in any fundamental way** the relationship
between states, citizens, and violence]{.underline}. [It may also have
**channelled military innovation** in certain directions, without
necessarily having **restricted overall the destructiveness** of the
weapons that were deployed]{.underline}.11(21)

### Link -- specific tech bans

#### De-legitimating one tech at a time bad --

However, while the circulation of norms around human security was a
necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the agreement and content
of the treaty, the character of the explanation given by a
constructivist norms account is limited. Norms are supposed to
facilitate more progressive standards of behaviour through, for example,
the 'rhetorical entrapment and shaming involved in hypocrisy', while a
constructivist approach is supposed to illuminate the 'nuances of
progressive and regressive effects of even strategically moral uses of
morality'.29 But existing norms-based accounts of the ATT have taken at
face value the moral representations of leading liberal states, as seen
in Garcia's equation of justifications with motivations.30 [And [broader
constructivist accounts of weapons activism have not tackled]{.mark} the
[ongoing patterns across]{.mark} the spectrum of [weapons transfers,
outside the banning of specific technologies.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Carpenter's insightful analysis of the question of why some weapons
systems are targeted for de-legitimation and not others brackets the
wider system of war preparation of which the development of weapons
systems is a part.31 [Constructivist [arguments implicitly assume that
progressive change]{.mark} in the area of weapons issues [can come from
de-legitimating one technology at a time. yet broader systems of war
preparation and war fighting will always generate new
technologies.]{.mark}]{.underline} And, as I argue later, [[liberal
states' war practices are kept off the agenda through risk
assessment]{.mark} processes [and legitimating claims based o]{.mark}n a
universalising [morality]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Claims about the normative power of conventional arms transfer control
regimes have been sternly tested by empirical studies. [[Studies]{.mark}
of patterns of arms exports [demonstrate how the 'self-declared ethical
turn' of major Western arms suppliers]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1990s
[[has not acted as a bar on weapons exports]{.mark}.]{.underline}32
[[The US]{.underline}]{.mark}A and Western European states '[[have
generally not exercised export controls]{.mark} so as [to discriminate
against human rights abusing]{.mark} or autocratic
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} during the post-Cold War period'.33 [At
best, [the effect]{.mark}]{.underline} of the EU Code of Conduct, which
served as one of the templates for the ATT, [[has been
th]{.underline}at]{.mark} 'EU members [[no longer appear to reward poor
human rights with arms transfers, even if they are not punishing it
either]{.underline}']{.mark}.34 [And in specific cases such as EU member
states' arms transfers to Libya, [evidence demonstrates comprehensive
violation of export control principles, even though exporting
governments were aware of the risks]{.mark} posed by transfers: licence
denials 'constitute exceptions]{.underline} in an overall
export-friendly environment'.35

For all these developments, [the [human security
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}'s take on war, conflict and armed violence
has not been without its critics. It has been described as the "new
orthodoxy" that [[is "unable to provide]{.mark} the basis for a
[substantive change of]{.mark} the system of [international
security]{.mark}]{.underline}," despite finding "the old language of
interstate war and conflict ... lacking." 35 Similarly, its [emphasis on
"[progressive" initiatives]{.mark} such as "[eliminat\[ing\] certain
types of weapon]{.mark}s" stands accused of [fail]{.mark}ing [to
adequately examine "the pathologies inherent in the structure of the
international system" that generate such
challenges.]{.mark}]{.underline}36 And [[when the "human" in human
security is naturalised as masculine,]{.mark} the inclusion of novel
threats and new actors leaves the parameters of security untouched,
meaning that "[state-based, militarised security remains
unchallenged.]{.mark}"]{.underline} 37 Feminist scholars have critiqued
the gendered concepts and practices of war, peace, militarization,
peacekeeping and soldiering, going well beyond the human security
framework in the process.38

Feminist critiques that challenge the parameters of human security can
usefully be combined with postcolonial accounts of IR that emphasise the
ways in which the discipline "can both deny empire while simultaneously
normalizing an imperial perspective on the world."39 [Some [of the main
themes of the human security agenda]{.mark} are illustrative of the
[need]{.mark} for [an imperial perspective in how we understand the
challenges facing weapons control.]{.mark}]{.underline} By this I mean
[[interpreting them with the aid of scholarship that challenges]{.mark}
methodological nationalism and [Eurocentrism]{.mark} in its analysis,
[mobilises feminist critiques of militarism,]{.mark} and [puts the
legacy of empire and colonialism, and the racial, gendered and classed
politics of imperial control, front and centre in its assessment of
contemporary challenges.]{.mark}40 Deploying [such resources gives us a
chance to rethink some]{.mark} of the [key assumptions]{.mark} around
human security and the prospects for regulating weapons
circulation]{.underline}.

### Link -- state

#### The law considers itself a form of justice, yet it fails to address underlying issues because of its biased perceptions of right and wrong. Law is not peace.

The violence of the law, or the institution of morality, follows the
violence of language. This second level of violence is related to the
first level in as much as it denies it. As Grosz (1998: 193) puts it,
the [[law]{.underline}]{.mark} 'refuses to face up to its own dependence
on, and enmeshment in, the more primordial structure'. [It is thus
violent precisely because it [places itself beyond violence and tries to
maintain order, forgetting the 'accidents and contingencies of \[its\]
favoured patterns of inclusion and exclusion']{.mark} (Corson, 2001:
871). Further developed in his famous essay, 'Force of Law', Derrida
(1992: 14) writes, 'since the origin of authority, the foundation or
ground, the position of the law can't by definition rest on anything but
themselves, [they are themselves a violence without ground'. The law
designates what passes as violent; it institutes what is right and
wrong]{.mark}, and [yet]{.mark}, ultimately, [it has no]{.mark}
essential [claim to]{.mark} such [authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} It can
only be an imposition, hence Derrida's focus on the word 'force', and
the phrase 'to enforce the law'. The force of law 'is not an exterior or
secondary possibility that may or may not be added as a supplement to
law. It is the force essentially implied in the very concept of justice
as law' (Derrida, 1992: 5, emphasis in original). And deconstruction,
that is, honest critique, is only possible 'as an experience of the
impossible, there where, even if it does not exist (or does not yet
exist, or never does exist), there is justice' (1992: 15, emphasis in
original). [[Justice, then, is impossible precisely because of
inescapable violence and social conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The third and final violence in Derrida's structure is the empirical
violence we recognize in the everyday realities of war -- assault,
murder, rape, and so on]{.underline}. For Derrida, this third layer also
rests on the previous two. It arises because of the inability of the
second level (law) to maintain order in the first level (difference).
[[Empirical violence]{.mark} is thus the material realization of the
originary system of differentiation. And it, in turn, [confirms the
violence of the law]{.mark}]{.underline} in its very transgression of
the law, demonstrating that the law must be enforced.

### Link -- war scenarios

#### The plan is a technocratic attempt to rationally manage war. This reinforces military industrial logic and justifies global violence in the name of avoiding their idea of terminal impacts 

**Krause, PhD, '12**

(Keith, IR@Geneva, *Leashing the Dogs of War: Arms Control from
Sovereignty to Governmentality* in [Reconceptualising Arms Control:
Controlling the Means of Violence]{.underline}, ed. Cooper & Mutimer)

So what remains is a set of formal [[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark}
agreements, mostly bilateral, but also a few that were multilateral,
designed to manage the potentially most dangerous and destabilizing
aspects of inter-state conflict dynamics. They
[[channeled]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark} between the superpowers **[[into a
technical and problem-solving logic]{.underline}]{.mark}** that would
facilitate decision making about [what kinds of weapons to produce and
deploy]{.underline}, and [under what circumstances to use]{.underline}
them. In addition, after some of the conceptual confusions of early
nuclear strategy (such as Massive Retaliation), arms control became part
of the logic by which decisions over appropriate (rational) strategies
could be designed. In the 1960s and 1970s, in context of the East-West
conflict and nuclear proliferation, maintaining the conditions of stable
deterrence and reducing the risk of war was perhaps a politically and
normatively laudable goal. But [[arms control was thus]{.mark} also
[linked to]{.mark} deterrence theory]{.underline} and practice, and [to
[the entire functioning of the]{.mark} so-called [military-industrial
complex]{.mark}]{.underline}, and **[[not something distinct and in
opposition to it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This vision would
not]{.underline} necessarily [be accepted by those]{.underline} -- such
as researchers at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI) and other think-tanks -- [who saw themselves as growing out
of]{.underline} the [peace]{.underline} and anti-nuclear weapons
[movement]{.underline}s, [but]{.underline} I think **[the policy
acceptability of SIPRI's work]{.underline}** (for example) [came
precisely from its progressive acceptance of the **underlying rules of
the game**]{.underline}.19 What were these rules of the game? There are
four elements of the Cold War practice of arms control that warrant a
deeper exploration in order to illustrate the normalizing and sovereign
logic of arms control. The [first]{.underline} element was [the attempt
by proponents of arms control to distinguish it from]{.underline}
advocacy of [disarmament]{.underline} in any form. Disarmament was
associated with the failed attempts to negotiate reductions in armaments
during the interwar period. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was associated
with the peace and anti-nuclear movements, and was [seen as the preserve
of impractical idealist efforts]{.underline} -- at best politically
naïve; at worst politically suspect. As Jeffrey Larsen notes, 'in the
early 1960s international security specialists began using the term arms
control in place of the term disarmament, which they believed lacked
precision and smacked of utopianism. The seminal books on arms control
published in that era all referred to this semantic problem'.20 So [arms
control was presented]{.underline} by its practitioners [as]{.underline}
directed towards controlling or [regulating the numbers, types,
deployment or use of certain types or quantities of arms]{.underline},
and [disarmament was]{.underline} defined as involving the [reduction or
the elimination]{.underline} of particular weapons and weapons systems,
and/or foreswearing of acquisition of new weapons.21 Although
occasionally agreements were signed that did eliminate weapons systems
or particular classes of weapons, most notably the 1987 Intermediate
Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty that eliminated an entire class of nuclear
weapons, when seen as part of the broader spectrum of nuclear
capabilities, such restrictions were tilted more towards the control
side of the equation.22 Overall, **[arms control reinforced, not
undermined, sovereign state power.]{.underline}** The
[second]{.underline}, related, element was [[the technocratic or
problem-solving orientation of arms control]{.mark} practices. Its
political acceptability [came from]{.mark} its claim to operate within
the same policy frame as other forms of [military-strategic thinking,
including]{.mark} of course [deterrence]{.mark} theory and strategy,
[alliance-building]{.mark}, [and the]{.mark} entire military-industrial
[logic that shaped]{.mark} Western (and arguably Eastern) [security
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. More importantly, however, [it provided
legitimacy to a counter-intuitive set of policy
prescriptions]{.underline} (such as leaving your own civilian population
vulnerable to nuclear attack, or revealing the equivalent of state
secrets as part of confidence-building measures). And finally, the
technocratic approach also was, in its strongest version, opposed to the
irrational and uncontrollable prescriptions of what, as early as
President Eisenhower, was called the military-industrial complex. High
level [[proponents]{.underline}]{.mark} of arms control (Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara, for example, as well perhaps as Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger), [regarded the defence establishment as unable to
set limits]{.underline} on its threat assessment and concomitant arms
acquisitions[. They [wished to subject security policy to **rational
managerial techniques**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} including such ideas
as diminishing marginal returns to investments in new weapons,
cost-benefit analysis for weapons systems, and trade offs between
competing goals (the guns-versus-butter debate).23 As Henry Kissinger is
once purported to have said, 'What in the name of God is strategic
superiority? What is the significance of it, politically, militarily,
operationally, at these levels of numbers? What do you do with it?' thus
expressing his frustration with the inability of the nuclear defense
establishment to provide a rationale for its weapons acquisition
plans.24 Even more hawkish arms controllers subscribed to the rational
calculus, with, for example, Paul Nitze arguing, with respect to
ballistic missile defense (Star Wars), that it had to be cost effective
on the margin in order to make strategic sense.25 [[Arms control]{.mark}
was thus **more rational**]{.underline} -- [and [promised to achieve
**the same national security goals**]{.mark}]{.underline} (including
war-fighting dominance) [at lower cost]{.underline}. But the actual
achievements of arms control negotiations, treaties and agreements are
difficult to assess, even if we use some counter-factual analysis. As
noted above, [arms control failed to stem the technological arms race,
failed to reduce spending]{.underline} on weapons, [and perhaps
played]{.underline} only [a marginal role in preventing a violent
superpower confrontation]{.underline}. [**[In all of its
forms]{.underline}**, **[arms control was not a transformative paradigm
-- but a techno-managerial project]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The
transformation of inter-state relations via either nuclear disarmament
or nuclear holocaust was to be avoided at all costs, and the management
of the superpower arms race was a sort of via media between these two
Manichean visions. Parenthetically, some prominent advocates, such as
Robert McNamara, or President Barack Obama, who have argued prominently
for the complete abolition of nuclear weapons, claim implicitly or
explicitly that there is a seamless conceptual thread that goes from
arms control to nuclear disarmament, and that all that distinguishes one
from the other is the relative time horizon or degree of pragmatism of
the advocates.26 But this is both conceptually and practically unlikely
-- if arms control is a set of techno-managerial practices fully
integrated into the Cold War logic of national security strategy, then
it is unable to make the leap to disarmament -- which involves an
entirely different idea about the place of violence in social and
political life. Recent debates around the ratification of the New START
treaty in late 2010 illustrated how it hardly represented a step towards
deeper nuclear reductions. The third core element of the arms control
paradigm was that [the Weberian state's monopoly over]{.underline} the
use of [[lethal force could]{.mark} not only be used]{.underline} to
impose order [domestically]{.underline} and to create social peace but
that **[it could also [be projected outwards]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to
create a form of international order that reduced the risk of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Just [as the domestic form]{.underline}
of the Weberian monopoly [renders the population vulnerable to the
predatory state]{.underline} (so much so that scholars such as Rudolph
Rummel could argue that democide -- state-sanctioned killing of citizens
-- was a greater risk than war);27 the international form also involved
rendering entire populations totally vulnerable to nuclear holocaust.
[In the name of national security **the very survival of the entire
population** could be put at risk]{.underline}, through policies such as
Mutual Assured Destruction or treaties such as the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) treaty. It is difficult to find a better example of
techno-managerial logic, instrumental rationality and the assertion of
sovereign power at work. Although perhaps an extreme example, this faith
in the ability of states to exercise restraint over the use of force,
also underlay the entire edifice of nuclear deterrence policy and
strategy. The final element was that [[the arms control
paradigm]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the much older balance of power
system, [was not a mechanism for maintaining order that eliminated war
or the use of force from the international system. It [assumed that the
main risk to be prevented was]{.mark} that of [large-scale inter-state
war between great powers]{.mark} or the superpowers, and that a
trade-off between this risk, and the risk of (or fact of) small and
large wars, especially in the postcolonial world, was an acceptable
one]{.underline}. The use of violence was either to be part of the logic
of so-called limited (nuclear) war or to be confined to the periphery,
to such places as Indochina, Angola, and Afghanistan (although this was
hardly peripheral to the Soviet Union). This was analogous to the
operation of the 19th century balance of power system, which sanctioned
the partitions of Poland, the Crimean War, and so forth in the name of
maintaining systemic stability. Similarly, the logic of limited nuclear
war, as presented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger, rested upon the
assumption that the use of force could be carefully calibrated and
controlled.28 [The neo-colonialist]{.underline} and political
[implications of pushing]{.underline} the problem of [war to the
periphery are of course clear]{.underline}, and one could argue that the
[[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} paradigm sketched above, especially
the treaties that stabilized the nuclear confrontation between East and
West (SALT I and II), [[made certain kinds of proxy wars more possible
or acceptable by creating escalatory fire-breaks]{.underline}]{.mark}
that facilitated the relatively risk-free provision of military
assistance to client states and movements. These fire breaks were easier
to create in the global South, where American and Russian troops managed
to avoid confronting each other directly, but less easy to create in
Europe. The history of attempts to achieve mutual and balanced force
reductions (the 1975 name for what in the late 1980s became the
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty), and of debates over the
necessity for intermediate range and tactical nuclear weapons in Europe,
and the problem of extended deterrence (or the nuclear umbrella) all
point towards a set of tensions or contradictions within the logic of
arms control. (23-6)

### A2 perm

#### The perm is problematic oscillation, at best -- the 1AC cannot be separated from the discourse that originally surrounded it

Dr. Jef **Huysmans '2**, MA (University of Hull), Ph.D. (University of
Leuven)) Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Studies, Director
of the Center for Citizenship, Identities, Governance, \" Defining
Social Constructivism in Security Studies: The Normative Dilemma of
Writing Security\", Alternatives January 2002 (questia)

Although one should not rule out the critical value of this kind of
research, there is something problematic or schizophrenic about it. The
analytical moment of the research dwells within a performative
understanding of language, while the critical moment resides in a
representational interpretation of language. [The main force of its
criticism relies on the distortion in the representation that it
\"discovers\" in the discourses it researches]{.underline}. In other
words, [this strategy assumes at some point that the unwanted
effects]{.underline} of the criminological or security discourses [can
be remedied by a correct representation]{.underline} of the world of
migration. [It thus seems to call for an undistorted
representation]{.underline} of the problematics of migration. A new
label for old phenomena may assist policymakers in finding approval for
new proposals. The question should therefore be whether international
crime, if objectively assessed, establishes a greater threat to the
internal security of EC member-states than it did a decade ago, or
whether ma ss attention paid to phenomena related to international crime
acts as an instrument in the justification of new investment. (22) [Such
[an oscillating strategy is problematic]{.mark}]{.underline} from the
social-constructivist perspective outlined above. [It assumes that a
true, undistorted history of the object of research]{.underline} (for
example, the relationship between migration and crime) [is
possible]{.underline}. [In the social-constructivist understanding of
language, this is not the case. [The object only appears within a
discursive formation]{.mark}; in other words, [a discursive formation is
**constitutive**]{.mark} for the social emergence of an object.
Therefore,]{.underline} [[an object of research cannot be separated from
discursive formations within which it becomes
visible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consequently, an undistorted history of
the relationship between migration and crime is no longer possible. It
will always articulate a criminological discourse of itself because that
discourse makes it possible for the question to appear. Therefore, the
social-constructivist perspective has to go the performative way a bit
further than the oscillating strategy. It has to engage more directly
and exclusively with the discursive forma tion in its performative and
generic dimensions. [[Jumping back in a representational
argument]{.mark} at the crucial point [is not a viable
move]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than being a history or semiology of
the referent object, a social-constructivist analysis stresses the
interpretation of the governing work of discursive formations.

#### Partial moves against militarism sanitize the broader system of arms transfer and war-making -- landmine ban proves

**Cooper '12** (Neil, PHD IR@Bradford, *Humanitarian Arms Control and
Processes of Securitization: Moving Weapons Along the Security
Continuum* in [Reconceptualising Arms Control: Controlling the Means of
Violence]{.underline}, ed. Cooper & Mutimer)

Second, the analysis highlights the relational elements that can be
involved in processes of securitization and desecuritization. [[In the
case of the landmines ban]{.underline}]{.mark} this manifested itself in
the way [[campaigners engaged in **simultaneous**]{.underline}]{.mark}
processes of [[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} of APMs (with respect
to the human as referent object) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (relative)
[[desecuritization]{.mark}]{.underline} (with respect to the state as
referent object) that worked to mutually reinforce the case for a ban.
In the case of pariah weapons generally, whilst there are a number of
factors that explain their stigmatization, one factor can be the way
their particular qualities are depicted as the antithesis of those
possessed by legitimized and particularly heroic weapons. Conversely,
[the [stigmatization]{.mark} of pariah weapons [works to **delineate
other weapons as normal**]{.mark} **and legitimate**]{.underline}. There
is therefore a process of mutual constitution that is at work in the way
different sets of weapons technology are framed and understood. Third,
the preceding analysis illustrates the relevance of Floyd's argument
that [processes of securitization or desecuritization can be positive
and negative]{.underline}, particularly when considered in terms of
their emancipatory effects. As noted above, in the case of landmines a
process of relative desecuritization vis-a-vis the state combined with a
process of extrasecuritization vis-a-vis the human to bring about the
production of a ban widely considered to have produced positive security
outcomes for individuals, communities, and the human as a collective. In
contrast, the relative [desecuritization of major weapons transfers
represents a much more ambiguous development. It could]{.underline}, of
course, [be argued that such a change]{.underline} in the security
labels attached to the weapons holdings of neighbouring states
[would]{.underline} not only reflect but [reinforce]{.underline} a move
to [more peaceable relations]{.underline}. In addition, the relative
deproblematization of defence transfers might be conceived as a positive
development, particularly for states that possess minimal domestic
defence industrial capacity, and are threatened by hostile neighbours.
[At the same time]{.underline} however, [such a shift]{.underline} along
the spectrum of security arguably [represents a quite regressive
development when applied to the issue of arms transfers]{.underline}.
This is particularly the case given that, irrespective of the powerful
ways in which the security labels attached to major weapons are shaped
by discourse and other forms of representation, they still possess a
residual materiality, however thin, that is characterized by their
capacity to facilitate the organized prosecution of violence. More
generally, the [[transfer of]{.mark} such [technologies can]{.mark} also
[be viewed as symptomatic of]{.mark} a world characterized by **deeply
[problematic higher order paradigms]{.mark}** [of security]{.mark} and
economy]{.underline}. At the very least then, the relative (if not
complete) desecuritization of major arms transfers would appear to raise
further questions about the Copenhagen School's normative commitment to
desecuritization. Although more accurately, it highlights the effects
that come from ratcheting down the security labels attached to 'normal'
arms transfers and subjecting them to the kind of standard bureaucratic
routines highlighted by Bigo, albeit the routines of the export
licencing process in this case. [One consequence]{.underline}, is that
[the many [thousands of export licences]{.mark} granted for the transfer
of weapons other than landmines, cluster munitions, and small arms [are
**far less likely to become the object of public
scrutiny**]{.mark}]{.underline} or become subject to intense public and
political contestation about the security effects of such exports. In
this sense at least, [the switch from a Cold War arms transfer system
where security motivations for exports often predominated to one where
economic motivations are more to the fore, has also been accompanied by
a corresponding **[depoliticization of]{.mark} contemporary
[transfers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [a phenomenon that highlights the
problematic nature of the neat division between politicized and
securitized issues outlined in the CS conception of securitization and
one that [highlights the downside of]{.mark} **even [partial moves
towards the desecuritization]{.mark} end [of the security
spectrum]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### The aff simplifies our struggle with violence and blames tools as the root cause, cloaking the role of the state.

[Within social and political theories of the everyday, the emphasis on
quality or qualities of life is **not clear-cut**. On the contrary, the
authors discussed earlier highlight the deep ambiguity of everyday life
and the tension between its qualities and its **vulnerability to control
and alienation**. Within the same set of discourses, the everyday is
simultaneously framed as a site for domination and control by means of
the exertion of power, whether subtle or openly coercive.]{.underline}

The everyday, as theorised earlier, is a vast, variegated and porous
realm, whose ragged edges are subject to constant rending and mending.
According to Lefebvre, Heller and others, it is also the underlying
basis of the entire polity and all of its levels.36 As such, it may
become the site of alienation, penetration, discipline and control. [One
of the most poignant warnings issued by the authors above37 is that
[everyday life may become instrumentalised]{.mark} to the logics of
**production and consumption**, or other **norms** of
modernity.]{.underline} A range of logics or overarching 'strategies' of
power38 -- including the quantification or objectification of human
beings,39 privatisation40 and the atomisation of individuals,41 dynamics
of self-regulation, production and the radicalisation of symbols or
communicative praxis42 -- may be extended into the realm of the
everyday, often by means of modernizing processes.43 In this manner, the
logics of modern production, consumption and regulation are able to
penetrate the realm of the everyday and transform its practices such
that they feed and generate the aforementioned processes.44 This concern
resonates with the Foucaultian idea of governmentality, which harnesses
existing social practice as a set of conduits and techniques for
administering power45 -- and which is the basis of the paradigm known as
governance, central to mainstream peacebuilding projects. [Indeed, as
postFoucaultian theorists point out, the penetration of the basic
elements of daily life -- survival, hygiene, [social structure]{.mark},
and behaviour, for instance -- [is one of the bases of **bio-political
control**]{.mark}.46 These strategies of [governance]{.mark} may be used
to create a form of 'pastoral' power which shapes communities through
the meeting of their basic physical and social needs, and often [occurs
through the **shaping and subjectification of the individual**]{.mark}
through his or her encounters [with the systems used to **produce and
satisfy needs**]{.mark}.]{.underline}47 This process of penetration may
be a force for the colonisation and domination of the everyday;48
however, since it meets many needs and improves, on some registers, the
lives of a large number of individuals, it may be perceived by them as a
form of freedom, emancipation or the realization of latent potential.49
This has important implications when applied to peace: given the strong
normative connotations of the concept, any form of peace, no matter how
constraining, may be perceived as a form of freedom from violence.

These dynamics of penetration, the cultivation of dynamics and the
(re)shaping of needs may contribute to a powerful form of alienation in
which human needs and potentialities are determined at a 'level' far
removed from that of individuals and communities, and in accordance with
its logic. Indeed, as Lefebvre and Smith both argue, the hierarchical
nature of the productive process may result in the stratification of the
polity and, as these levels ascend, the allocation of power to the
highest levels. [As these levels are formed and abstracted, [they tend
to **simplify human activity** by homogenising it into a set of uniform
codes]{.mark}, symbols or processes,50 [removing its subtler nuances and
complexity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore, as Lefebvre argues, the
processes in which these logics unfold are designed to repel or absorb
disruptions that may extrude from non-penetrated spaces; the process of
'recuperation' may, in fact, strengthen the institutions or logics of
power. Indeed, this is the dilemma posed by a number of
post-structuralist theorists, remarkably Deleuze and Guattari51 and
Foucault:52 to resist a machine is to fuel its productive processes and
to provide material upon which it can work. In turn, these dynamics may
lead, perhaps ironically, to the alienation of power from the realm of
everyday life. Alienation, in this context, involves the removal of
agency in the face of power and, as a result, the formation of a major
disjunction between the needs defined and produced by the strategies of
power and those emerging from the immediate, local experience of
individuals and groups.53

[[The state, on whose agency peace decisively relies, is
coercive]{.mark}, then, in several aspects. The state is violent from a
critical perspective, first and foremost, for the presence of an array
of power networks that effectively invest in, and work, the state,
enabling it in its functioning.]{.underline} The state is also coercive
for the sheer, unmatched corporeal authority it entails. [[This
authority]{.mark}, seeking constantly to grow and more tightly organize,
[makes the **state** a **war machine**]{.mark} in interstate relations
and a virtual dungeon keeper domestically.]{.underline} The reigning
paradigm of peace seems to be greatly premised on this authority, which,
as Foucault indicates in his discussion of *raison d'état*, is part and
parcel of the modern governmental rationality, for which the strong
state authority is "the very essence of peace." 46 [Clearly this
**[peace can be costlier than]{.mark} the price of the
[conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In fact, the precarious nature of this statecentric notion of peace has
been noted for some time. The more recent thinking in peace research has
therefore sought to move beyond the established, state-led models. What
Richmond calls the "emancipatory" model of liberal peace is precisely
some such effort to shift away from the state, forming an instance of
peace constructed "from below." 47 This model aims at a "privatization
of peace," as Richmond explains, via (a) a new notion of "human
security" that replaces the concept of state security motivating the
conventional models of peace; and (b) an increasing prominence of
nonstate actors in the process, with a specific appeal to "the agency of
the individual." [Yet Richmond hints at the same time that the makeover
effected by [this new model in peace thinking]{.mark}, support by the
United Nations and major donor states, [may have come about for none
other than its somewhat **sinister function** to legitimate the
increasingly dubious practice of humanitarian
intervention]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is, a façade of actors other
than the state are possibly being put to work to cover up what is at
heart a state-led, authoritarian function. "Non-state actor
intervention, and more specifically that of NGOs generally," Richmond
notes, "is perceived unquestionably as legitimate because of their
normative and practical roles and precisely because they are perceived
not to be representative of the interests of a specific state." 48 [That
[this model of peace]{.mark}, purportedly "from below," is far from
being an evasion of the conventional, statecentric thinking, [is
evidenced by]{.mark} the **[pitfalls]{.mark}** in the model as described
by Richmond. In the [first]{.mark} place, the [nonstate actors]{.mark}
vying for funds appear to be highly [susceptible to
**manipulation**]{.mark} by donor states. 49]{.underline} Further, the
initiatives led by nonstate actors do not always and necessarily
include, or even heed, local actors, a discrimination that is strikingly
statist in character. [50 Finally, the initiatives by nonstate actors
are by **no means free of sedition**, of "coercion and conditionality,"
with some form of peace offered in return for the transformation of the
local markets and the **social and normative structures**, especially in
localities where such transformation is not desired, which Richmond
finds reminiscent of past "**imperial" mandates**.]{.underline} 51

[[There is a bias that deems any change and quest for justice in
practices of arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} and disarmament
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} susceptible to generating an '**assault',
[']{.mark}**[[reduced security']{.underline}]{.mark}, and 'greater
militarization'. The superpower arms race and the emphasis on
'stability' had effectively marginalized all efforts to reflect on
questions of 'justice' in practices of arms control and disarmament.

It became difficult to address problems of justice in practices of arms
control and disarmament as those engaged in these practices of control
suffered from a crisis of memory, an intellectual amnesia that enabled a
forgetfulness of their past history. Stuart Croft observes that 'arms
control has a long and rich history across many different cultures' but
'there has been little emphasis on the historical record of arms
control'.93 [Croft does not seek to explore the motivations but is
content to note that 'too often, [arms control is]{.mark} seen in too
restricted a historical perspective; in [too narrow]{.mark} a sense in
terms of its purposes; [and]{.mark} in [too shallow]{.mark} a fashion
[in terms of its complexity']{.mark}.94 It can be argued that [the
politics behind this]{.mark} short [memory is to encourage theoretical
abstractions]{.mark} pertaining to arms control premised on deterrence.
Deterrence projected as an exercise in rationality also represented an
exercise in 'abstraction' to guide practices towards vertical arms
control among the superpowers.]{.underline} A more empirical exercise
towards non-proliferation sought to develop horizontal regulations of
behaviour among other nation-states. These empirical practices of
non-proliferation generated resistance among the nation-states through
the discourse of 'nuclear apartheid'. Hugh Gusterson does not hesitate
to contend that:

#### Actions like the plan serve to normalize the bureaucracy of war

**Cooper,** International Relations and Security, Department of Peace
Studies, U of Bradford**, 11**

\[Neil, "Contemporary Security Policy, Vol. 32, No.1", p. 138-139, SL\]

For example, each [[export licensing]{.underline}]{.mark} ofﬁcer in the
US State Department approved an average of 1,312 export licences in
2008, a ﬁgure that excludes the 10,000 applications that were returned
without action because the necessary forms were not properly ﬁlled in.25
At one and the same time therefore, these [[decisions occur]{.mark}
[thoroughly within the terrain of security]{.mark}, dealing as they do
with weapons technologies[, yet]{.mark} they [are normalized,]{.mark}
routinized, serial moments of exception operating [as part of a
day-to-day]{.mark} [bureaucracy]{.mark} whose only external audience is
usually the company applying for licences]{.underline}. This is security
as (almost) an oxymoron: [technologies that are not only securitized but
militarized, yet dealt with in individual decisions that are, by and
large, not even heavily politicized. The vast majority of these
decisions involve judgements about the nature of the recipient and the
neighbourhood they occupy]{.underline} -- are they an ally? Do they have
a good human rights record? Would the particular weapons being licensed
exacerbate regional security dilemmas? In some respects then[, [much of
defence export regulation]{.mark} and practice might be said to [rest
on]{.mark} [an]{.mark} acute [awareness]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the fact
that [the meaning of military technology]{.mark} is [deﬁned in
relation]{.mark} to its context]{.underline}. This is neatly captured by
Bourne's concept of the 'social life of a gun',26 whereby [the [labels
attached to military technology]{.mark} change [depending on the labels
attached to its owner]{.mark}, its [geographical location]{.mark} [and
as it traverses from the legal to the black market]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For example, although brake pads for M1 Abrams tanks are virtually
identical to brake pads for ﬁre trucks, it is only when sold for use on
tanks overseas that they become subject to the (ordinary) extraordinary
measures required by the export licensing process.27

The nuclear danger is real---even more ominous, as we will show, than
most people appreciate. But the [[fixation on weapons has obscured the
real menace]{.mark}: the [political conflict]{.mark} and violence
r[aging]{.mark} around the world that [could one day burn out of
control]{.mark}]{.underline} and set off a nuclear cataclysm. [[As the
world debates largely irrelevant missiles and arms control treaties, the
superpowers are fanning the flames of conflict and war]{.mark} from
Afghanistan to Nicaragua, Lebanon to Cambodia. Forty years of history
reveal that [such conflicts can suddenly veer out of control and even
erupt into open superpower confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Yet in a time of unprecedented public concern about nuclear war,
few---even in the peace movement---protest the nuclear hazards of their
governments\' foreign intrigues and interventions.

Those of us concerned with the nuclear threat have long been like the
apocryphal drunk who searches for his lost keys hour after hour under a
lamppost---because it\'s light there. The giant weapons systems are
seductive, the obvious place to look for answers to the nuclear peril.
The light there is good. But there is little to be found. [If we want
the keys to a safer world, [we must turn the light to the real conflicts
and battlefields where the superpowers and their clients confront each
other every day,]{.mark} often hidden from public view, [and where they
periodically collide in terrifying crises that threaten to provoke
worldwide catastrophe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Public issues generally
develop a \"culture,\" a consensus about the key questions, the level of
analysis, and the language of debate. Since these assumptions are
shared, they rarely come up for discussion. [[The common perspective
that guides discourse]{.mark} on nuclear war and peace [is]{.mark} what
we call [the \"weapons paradigm]{.mark}.\" [It magnifies the importance
of the weapons themselves]{.mark} far beyond their real significance. It
views weapons [as the basic source of security or insecurity, power or
weakness, peace or war. It pegs the arms race as the problem and some
change in that race as the solution.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Impact -- military intervention

#### Aff is a slick PR tool that makes it easier to justify military interventions

**Schwartz and Derber 93** \-- William A. Schwartz, a professor of
property law at Yeshiva University\'s Cardozo School of Law, and Charles
Derber, Professor of Sociology at Boston College, THE NUCLEAR SEDUCTION:
WHY THE ARMS RACE DOESN'T MATTER- AND WHAT DOES, University of
California Press, 1993.

Moreover, if intellectuals in government, private think tanks such as
the Rand Corporation, and academia want to stay friendly with the powers
that be and remain on their lucrative contract lists, they must frame
inquiry into the nuclear issue, like other issues, [in an ideologically
acceptable manner. Weaponitis does the job nicely, even when
disagreements about technical details emerge within the paradigm.
Denouncing, say, road-mobile ICBMs in favor of rail-mobile ones may at
worst annoy government officials holding a different view. Denouncing
American foreign policy, beyond narrow limits, can get one
blacklisted.]{.underline}

For the government itself, and for those who support the essentials of
its long-standing, bipartisan foreign policy, [weaponitis has an
irresistible virtue: in a society deeply alarmed by the possibility of
nuclear war, it diverts attention from Third World U.S. military
interventionism and toward the far less important nuclear arms
competition]{.underline}. Arms control plays a particularly important
role in this process, as we noted in Chapter 9. [It is a widely popular,
seemingly progressive, and highly visible activity that the state can
use to show its commitment to reducing the nuclear danger. The executive
branch manages the negotiation process and the information flow about
it. The Soviets can be blamed for problems even when the Americans are
balking]{.underline}. Years can be spent working out treaties on minor
issues such as the Euromissiles, with tremendous public relations
bonanzas at the end if the efforts succeed. And all the while Soviet and
American leaders can bomb [Third World countries, support unstable
dictatorships, arm belligerents, pursue foreign policy as usual, and
still receive relatively good press on the nuclear question because of
their \"commitment to arms control.\" This manipulation cleverly coopts
the peace movement\'s critique of the arms race into a slick government
public relations tool. It is an effective way to manage an issue that
could explode into serious popular dissent and unrest if the public
grasped where the real hazards lie]{.underline}.

### Impact -- imperialism

#### Against the backdrop of U.S. military dominance, arms limitations serve to maintain hegemony

**Cooper,** International Relations and Security, Department of Peace
Studies, U of Bradford**, 07**

\[Neil, "Putting Disarmament Back in the Frame", p. 353-354, SL\]

[This article aims to examine both arms control theory and practice from
a critical security studies perspective. It is therefore concerned to
deconstruct the mainstream discourse on arms control]{.underline} in
order to illuminate the interests that underpin received wisdom on the
issue; to online the structures of power established by current
practice; to highlight the emancipatory potential immanent in
contemporary approaches to arms limitation and to consider how these
might be extended to build a system of 'disarmament from below'.

[First, I will suggest that the supposed distinctions between arms
control and disarmament that lie at the heart of arms control theory
represent the mirage creation of a dominant disciplinary discourse. I
will also argue that Stuart Crofts' attempt to reinvent arms control for
the post-Cold War era has produces a teleological history that ignores
the extent to which [the development of arms limitation]{.mark} has been
non-linear and which [downplays the role of power in shaping discourse
and practice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Second, I suggest that -- in contrast to the impression created by an
increasingly pessimistic literature on the topic -- [[the world
is]{.mark} not only [experiencing a lot of arms limitation]{.mark}, but
that is also [experiencing a significant amount of disarmament]{.mark}
particularly when judged against the goals elucidated in the disarmament
negotiations of the 1950s and 60s. Furthermore, I will suggest that this
point is largely ignored in the mainstream literature on arms control,
which still persists in 'imagining' disarmament as a
failure.]{.underline} Such a framing acts as a powerful tool of
delegitimization that means proposals for more far-reaching and
emancipatory forms of disarmament arrive still0born into the zeitgeist
of IR academia and global society that disarmament utopias may well be
realizable.

[However, I will also suggest that [the current disarmament and broader
arms limitation system]{.mark} [is,]{.mark} to a significant extent, an
asymmetric one, [designed to preserve the military hegemony of the
US]{.mark} in particular and [the]{.mark} West in general. On the one
hand therefore, we can now be said to live in [disarmament
system]{.mark} of sorts, but its [configuration is]{.mark} one primarily
[shaped in the interests of]{.mark} a disarmament empire -- [the
US]{.mark}A. Ironically therefore, the current disarmament system is one
that nevertheless legitimizes significant levels of global -- and
particularly US -- military expenditure and which serves to
further]{.underline} embed [[both the military supremacy]{.mark} of the
USA [and the stark disparities that exist between spending on
]{.mark}]{.underline}[arm]{.mark}ament[s [compared with spending on
human security]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Moreover, [the]{.mark} very
[asymmetry in military power]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} current [arms
limitation system is designed to shore up]{.mark} actually [creates an
incentive for weaker nations to pursue non-conventional military
technologies or strategies (NVC weapons/terrorism)]{.mark} as a way of
offsetting their marked inferiority in conventional
weaponry.]{.underline}

[Finally, I will suggest that whilst the influences maintaining this
system are certainly very strong, practices immanent in the contemporary
arms limitation system and the challenges presented to it by immerging
military technologies suggest that a more emancipatory system of
'disarmament from below' -- one geared less to the preservation of
hegemon and more to the promotion of human security -- may be
realizable.]{.underline}

[How does the rhetoric of '[rogue']{.mark} or '[barbarian']{.mark}
vis-a\`-vis the '[civilized']{.mark} help to address the problem of
weapons regulation and prohibition]{.underline}? [[These civilizational
terms]{.mark} of reference [have gained global currency]{.mark} among
academics, politicians, [and policy-makers in the everyday discourses on
arms control and disarmament]{.mark}, and have been deployed [to]{.mark}
differentiate, denounce, ostracize, and [impose sanctions on the
'Other'. The seriousness of these discourses in the context of weapons,
particularly weapons of mass destruction, cannot be
over-emphasized.]{.mark} The concept of 'civilization' is being deployed
as a unit of analysis to map the terrain of political developments and
as a cultural moniker of differences that cannot be easily negotiated as
it subsumes even sovereign identities of nation-states and insists that
'[the clash of civilizations will dominate global
politics']{.mark}]{.underline}.1 In projecting these civilizational
differences it is further claimed that 'the primary objective of arms
control is to prevent the development by non-Western societies of
military capabilities that could threaten Western interests'.2

Prior to investigating any such claims in the context of weapons, it is
helpful to engage with scholars who have tried to conceptualize
civilization discourses to suggest their significance and relevance as
tools of analysis. [[The]{.mark} formula '[**West and the Rest'**
is]{.mark} often [projected as **representative of danger**]{.mark},
generating concern that there exists an 'established common sense, made
real in collective discourse, [that **foregrounds** some dangers while
**repressing**]{.mark} or ignoring [others']{.mark}.]{.underline}3 It
has encouraged Mark Salter to suggest the surfing of a new
'civilizational realism' to re-inscribe imperial cartographies on the
post-Cold War order. [[The **dual function**]{.mark} of this move [is to
render the '**West' unproblematic** and to **'barbarize' the multiple
'non-Wests'**]{.mark}.4 It is asserted that the civilization discourse
represents a form of '**[technological mentality']{.mark}** that
**[demonizes the others and appropriates]{.mark}** for [itself the most
advanced weapons of war as achievements of its own
civilization]{.mark}.5 [It encompasses both '**civilizing
processes**']{.mark} of interdependence and expansion through mutual
identification [and]{.mark} is vulnerable to '**[decivilizing
processes']{.mark}** that pose a threat to the established status
quo.6]{.underline} This approach encourages us to question, 'must we
always polarize in order to polemicize?'7

No effort is made among the arms control and disarmament experts to
acknowledge that the idea of 'progress of civilization' was not
universal in the early 20^th^ century, even as it was mobilized towards
'alleviating, as much as possible, the calamities of war'.72 But it is
this lack of universality in the laws of war that is expressed time and
again by international lawyers seeking to regulate and prohibit the use
of aero-chemical warfare.73 [[The lack of attention to these normative
claims of civilizational practices, the problems of inclusion and
exclusion in constituting arms control and disarmament agreements, and
imperial concerns with the transfer of weapons]{.mark} generate a
historical legacy that [underscores]{.mark} the significance of
understanding how practices of **[arms control and disarmament]{.mark}**
have been deployed [as **civilizational practices**]{.mark} since the
late 19th century. Hugh Tinker observes that the '[comradeship of arms
was confined to the **White race'** during the **Second World
War**]{.mark}.74 [This]{.mark}, he claims, [was]{.mark} '**very much [a
war about race \... disguised \... as a war for
freedom]{.mark}**'.75]{.underline} The principle of racial equality
proposed by the Japanese had already been rejected at the time of the
writing of the Covenant of the League of Nations.

The principle of racial equality was not recognized even as military
conscription was introduced in Western and colonized societies during
the Great War. The myth of the 'martial races' was deliberately
cultivated to mobilize the colonized to fight in imperial wars but the
problems of supplying inferior weapons to the native soldiers even as
they fought in the imperial wars of Europe led to mutinies in the
colonies.76 [[The **non-Whites**]{.mark}, especially the Blacks, were
humiliated as they [were assigned only to '**transport, engineer and
other services** in which the soldiers did not carry
]{.mark}]{.underline}[arms']{.mark} but observed the 'soldiers from
India operating infantry weapons, artillery and armour', even if they
were of an inferior quality.7[7]{.underline} Interestingly, Albert Memmi
notes how, with the end of the Second World War, European governments
'prohibited the showing of certain movies of resistance in colonial
theatres \... In objection to this, it was stated that American
Westerns, gangster pictures and war propaganda strips had already shown
how to use a revolver or tommy gun'.78 [[This concern]{.mark} with
regard to resistance films [betrayed]{.mark} a concern and a sustained
feeling of [**vulnerability** that '**poorly armed or even unarmed
oppressed people did dare attack their
oppressors**]{.mark}**'**.]{.underline}79

[Several critiques of these civilizational discourses are available but
[none seek]{.mark}s to question the deployment of a '**civilizational
paradigm**' [to address the **problem** of arms control and disarmament.
It is this very **silence** in the arms control and disarmament
community that serves as a **provocation** to undertake this
study]{.mark} with the help of critical studies and postcolonial
scholarship on arms control and disarmament.]{.underline} This very
small community of scholars is empathetic towards the need for a more
rigorous historical analysis of practices of arms control and
disarmament and is very critical of the state-centric structure of the
international system. [But [this scholarship]{.mark} too [has failed to
seize the opportunity presented in the form of **civilization
discourses** that **subsume the sovereign state system**]{.mark} to
project civilization as the overwhelming identity that leads to
confrontation on weapons issues and will be the source of
inter-civilizational conflict. **[The postcolonial scholarship has not
addressed the problem of weapons significantly]{.mark}** but has taken
issue with civilizational bias in security studies more generally. But
the commitment of both these approaches towards articulating the
concerns of the marginalized and questioning hegemonic practices makes
them suitable for articulating a critique of civilization discourses in
the context of weapons.]{.underline} It is therefore contributions from
both critical security studies and postcolonial studies that are
deployed to undertake a further critique of civilization discourses in
the context of arms control and disarmament.

There is a growing consciousness among critical security studies
scholars of a 'Western security culture' that has 'powerfully shaped the
NACD (Nuclear Arms Control and Disarmament) policies and practices of
states, and helped to define what it means for states to pursue their
national interests'.50 These scholars question the development of
security studies in its 'modern form' as an attempt to represent itself
as a 'seemingly neutral and timeless language of social science'.51
[Barkawi and Laffey argue that [the Western right to bear arms and use
force is]{.mark} 'legitimated in terms of [a **civilizing
mission**]{.mark} of one kind or another \... [the **assumption is that
it is the right of the West to bear arms to liberate the "natives**."
This is and always has been the **primary justification for
imperialism**]{.mark} in all its forms; [it is about civilizing the
barbarians]{.mark}'.]{.underline}52 A further claim is made that
'conventional security studies rests on and reproduces Eurocentric
histories and geographies of world politics'.53 It is important to note
that

[[**Eurocentric accounts of great power competition** tend to **take the
weak** -- the 'natives', the colonies, the periphery, the Third World,
the global South]{.mark} -- more or less for granted. They do so in the
specific sense that agency, rationality, power and morality, as well as
the fundamental dynamics of the world order, are assumed to reside in
the global North. Alternatively, **[these various others are assumed to
be just like us, only weaker]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This generates a
different problem, inasmuch as it denies their own history, their
difference.54

[This idea of [peace]{.mark}, which consistently **[ignores the larger

into those of culture, 86 enables a discourse of conflict-free,
power-free association with the other via a principle of "us and them."
This, Zizek points out, [is a **false universality**]{.mark}, which
ultimately amounts to nothing but ignoring the other.]{.underline}
Instead, he suggests an antinomy of "us versus them," which he traces to
Saint Paul, as a viable principle to regulate interaction with the
other. 87 This illiberal principle, which negates the assumption of a
possible and natural harmony, avoids reducing the opponent to an
orientalistic, manipulated subject position of "victim."

### Alt -- rethinking

#### The only way to solve violent warism that leads to securitization is to recognize our presumption of it and to rethink. 

**Cady, professor of philosophy at Hamline University in Minnesota, 10**

\[Duane L, "From Warism to Pacifism - A Moral Continuum", p. 89-91, SL\]

Security comes with cultural stability and freedom from fear. [[Amassing
weapons]{.mark} for protection [against]{.mark} possible
[invasion]{.mark} from without [provokes others to do the same]{.mark}.
Not wanting to be bullied, each side tries to gain arms superiority;
thus [offensive weapons are multiplied]{.mark} [and everyone is less
secure]{.mark}, less free from fear. [The cycle]{.mark} is
repeated.]{.underline} Modern technological societies have driven the
arms race to a point where the means of our security are the means of
others' insecurity and thus the means of our insecurity. As dangerous as
this situation is, [it does have the consequence of [prompt]{.mark}ing
[a rethinking of the means of defense]{.mark} [and]{.mark} encouraging a
genuine search for [effective alternatives to]{.mark} traditional
[warism]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is obvious that no nation can convert
instantly from dependence on traditional military defense to civilian-
based nonviolent defense. Nations have gotten into the present
predicament in small but steady increments and the most likely route
away from warism and the arms race would also be incremental. It will
take time, but each step will ease the current dangers. It will take
determination, but confidence is built by modest yet persistent gains.
[[It will require exposing cultural predispositions to warism]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} it will take a [socialization to peace making
across]{.mark} all [segments of culture]{.mark}. These too will come
slowly in stages rather than by miraculous conversion from one extreme
to the other.]{.underline} The pacifist continuum and the range of
nonviolent actions both allow and encourage a gradual backing away from
warism, a backing into pacifism. Understanding peace and war to be
related by these gradations makes possible a spectrum of practical
alternatives so that the cycle of weapons and war need not be pursued
beyond the brink. Certainly, even a gradual transarmament from
traditional dependence on conventional and nuclear weapons and armies to
civilian- based nonviolent defense will require a generous transfusion
of pacifism---both in the anti-war and in the positive peace
formulations--- into all aspects of culture, especially including public
and private education. Perhaps [this will begin with **[recognizing our
general presumption of warism and]{.mark} with [reclaim]{.mark}ing
[the]{.mark} [lost]{.mark} and neglected [history of nonviolent
action]{.mark}**. [Similar efforts have been important to recover
lost,]{.mark} repressed, [and]{.mark} [neglected racia]{.mark}l and
[cultural minority history]{.mark}, as well as to correct [gender-
biased language]{.mark} and role definition, [and]{.mark} to
[recognize]{.mark} [injustices based on sexual orientation, class
status, and disability]{.mark}]{.underline}. While progress is painfully
slow in these areas, progress is being made and it affects the lives of
many. Slow as it may be, progress at becoming aware of and backing away
from warism will also transform our foundation values and will directly
affect all of our lives.

### Alt -- reject militarism

#### AFF reduces war to one instance of violence-- the alternative is reject this destructive way of thinking in favor of acknowledging specific, contextualized causes of pervasive militarism

Feminist [[ethical questions about war are not reducible to wondering
how to avoid large-scale military conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} despite
human tendencies toward violence. Instead, [the [central questions
concern the omnipresence of militarism]{.mark}, the possibilities of
making its presence visible, [and the]{.mark} potential for [resistance
to its physical and hegemonic force.]{.mark} Like \"[solutions\"
to]{.mark} the preponderance of [violence perpetrated by men against
women]{.mark} that [fail to analyze]{.mark} and articulate
[relationships between everyday violence and institutionalized]{.mark}
or invisible [systems]{.mark} of patriarchal, racist, and economic
[oppression, analyses that charac-terize eruptions of military violence
as isolated]{.mark}, persistent [events, are]{.mark} practi- cally and
[theoretically insufficient]{.mark}.]{.underline}

2\) Peach faults just-war theory for its failure to consider
alternatives to war, stating that \"the failure of most just-war
theorists to seriously contemplate alternatives to war is\... radically
deficient from the perspectives of pacifist feminist and others opposed
to knee-jerk militaristic response to civil strife\" (Peach 1994, 158).
She argues that feminist just-war theorists, including Elshtain, should
also pay more attention to pacifist arguments.

When Peach discusses \"alternatives to war,\" she is clearly referring
to alternatives to entering into war, or to participating in \"the
escalation of conflicts.\" [[The avoidance of eruptions of military
violence]{.mark} [is]{.mark} certainly [impor-tant]{.mark},]{.underline}
and Peach is correct that feminist insights about conflict resolution
could present significant recommendations in this regard.
[[However,]{.mark} feminist [moral imagination cannot end there]{.mark}.
[In thinking of alternatives to war, we need to]{.mark} continue to
[imagine alternatives to militaristic economies, symbolic systems,
values, and political institutions]{.mark}. The task of constructing
such alternatives is far more daunting and comprehensive than creating
alternatives to a specific event or kind of event.]{.underline}

Pacifist writers as diverse as Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and
Barbara Deming have emphasized the fact that pacifism entails a critique
of pervasive, systematic human violence. Despite its reductionist
tendencies, there is much to learn from the ways in which pacifists
conceive of war as a presence, as well as the pacifist refusal to let go
of the ideal of peace. Characterizing pacifism as motivated by the
desire to avoid specific events disregards the extent to which pacifism
aims to criticize the preconditions underlying events of war.

Hypatia

3\) Following several influential moves in feminist philosophy, Peach
rejects just-war theory\'s reliance on abstraction-of the realities, or
\"horrors,\" of war; of enemies as one-dimensional evil, killable
Others; and of the ethical responses needed to address the morality of
war, such as a privileging of justice and rights over love and caring.
Following Elshtain, she believes that feminist just-war principles
should be more particularized, contextualized, and individualized.

[But [the abstraction of the particularities of war]{.mark} depends on
an abstraction of war itself. The distance of such abstraction [is
created]{.mark} in part [by willingness to think of war without
considering the presence of war in \"peaceful\"
times.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Wars becomes conceptual entities-objects
for consideration-rather than diverse]{.mark}, historically loaded
[exemplifications]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [context]{.mark}s in which
they occur. [In order to notice the particular and individual realities
of war, attention must be given to the particular, individual, and
contextualized causes and effects of pervasive militarism, as well as
the patterns and connections among them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[point]{.underline}]{.mark} [that is

a policy of global interventionism'.3 Nonetheless, and this is the key

[have changed very substantially since the Cold War]{.underline}.4

financial crises, technological innovation and the rapidly shifting

derived as they are from the disorientingly vast and hyper-accelerated
retrenchment of our current political situation, are best won through
the broad strokes of what Slavoj Žižek calls "systemic" critique. For
Žižek, looking squarely at interpersonal or subjective violences (e.g.,
torture, drone strikes), drawn as we may be by their gruesome and
immediate appeal, distorts the critic's broader field of vision. [[For a
fuller picture, one must pull one's critical focus back several steps to
reveal the deep, objective structures that undergird the spectacular
manifestations of]{.mark} everyday, subjective
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline} (Žižek 2008, 1-2). Immediately, however,
one confronts the limit question of Žižek's mandate: how does one
productively draw the boundaries of a system without too severely
dampening the force of objective critique? For practical purposes

#### Academics should critically investigate arms control framing -- policy assumptions create their own echo chamber

**Cooper and Mutimer, PhDs, 12**

(Neil, IR@Bradford, David, PoliSci@York, *Arms control for the 21^st^
Century: Controlling the Means of Violence* in [Reconceptualising Arms
Control: Controlling the Means of Violence]{.underline}, ed. Cooper &
Mutimer)

The period between 1960 and 19[61]{.underline} [saw the emergence
of]{.underline} some of the [key texts upon which Cold War arms control
**practice and theory** was built]{.underline}. This included the
Daedalus special issue on arms control of 1960, Schelling and Halperin's
Strategy and Arms Control, and Hedley Bull's The Control of the Arms
Race both of which appeared in 1961.1 The same year also witnessed the
publication of Donald Brennan's edited book, Arms Control, Disarmament
and National Security, based on the articles in the earlier special
issue of Daedalus.2 The influence of the Daedalus publication in
particular is reflected in the journal's production of further special
issues on arms control in 1975 and 1991 each of which reviewed progress
on the agenda of the 1960 publication and assessed the new arms control
challenges emerging on its fifteenth and thirtieth anniversary
respectively.3 [Given the fiftieth anniversary]{.underline} of the
Daedalus special issue has only just passed and that the same landmark
has now been reached for the other publications[, it is an apposite time
to]{.underline} once again [review the arms control agenda]{.underline}
of the 1960s, [to consider new practices that have emerged
s]{.underline}ince then [and]{.underline} to [ask whether either are fit
for purpose in a post-Cold War, post-9/11 era]{.underline}, apparently
replete with new arms control challenges. Over and above the question of
timeliness however, the production of this special issue was animated by
our concern that [the academic community has largely been
reduced]{.underline}, on the one hand, [to recording the new practices
or challenges of arms control]{.underline} (although often using
language other than that of arms control), [rather than **shaping the
former or anticipating the latter**]{.underline}. On the other hand, [it
has engaged in an extensive reconceptualization of security]{.underline}
and its associated practices [that has]{.underline}, nevertheless[,
managed to pay scant attention to]{.underline} questions of [arms and
their control]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, it has tended to be
**[the policy]{.underline}** or NGO **[community]{.underline}** that
[has driven new agendas]{.underline} in arms control [rather than the
academy]{.underline}. Moreover, [given the predominantly
**problem-solving orientation**]{.underline} [of academic arms
control]{.underline}, [there has not even been]{.underline} much that
can be described as **[an attempt to critically reflect on the
relationship between current practice and traditional arms control
theory,]{.underline}** [on the security **framings underlying current
policies**]{.underline} [or on the functions served by the current
global architecture of arms control]{.underline}. In part, this may
reflect one of the downsides of the widening and deepening of security
studies that has occurred since the 1980s, which has arguably resulted
in relatively less attention being paid by more critical analysts to
some of those areas normally associated with the thinner and shallower
notion of security held in traditional security or strategic studies.

[[Education]{.mark}, I believe, [can act as]{.mark} a critical sort of
'[immunization']{.mark} from helplessness [in the face of global
violence]{.mark} along the lines that Seligman and related psychologists
hoped behavioral interventions could immunize individuals from forms of
depression and anxiety (Seligman, 1992). If this sounds too absolute or
ambitious, then to borrow the terms of Lazarus and Folkman, I believe in
[the potential of education to embody crucial positive coping
strategies]{.mark} in the face of oftentimes-painful learning about
violence in our world, as well as to encourage the growth of
psychological 'resilience' in our reactions to various relations of
violence. Specifically, [learning consciously based in experience or
praxis,]{.mark} after Dewey and Freire, holds the best chance of
[strengthen]{.mark}ing the individual citizen [against]{.mark} the
descent into spiralling [feelings of helplessness when confronted by
violence in our world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Educational thinkers and
researchers embracing critical pedagogy use the term 'pedagogy of
praxis' to reflect a participatory, experiential approach to education,
synonymous with both Dewey's conception of education-as-experience and
Freire's notions of 'conscientization' and praxis (as
thought/action/reflection) (Schugurensky, 2000; Gadotti & Milton, 1996).
Schugurensky (2000) argues that the experience of participatory
democracy comprises an optimal setting for the learning of democracy,
demonstrated through an analysis of the comprehensive implementation of
participatory budgeting processes in Porto Alegre, Brazil (the city that
engendered the first World Social Fora). To complement Freire's
conception that as individuals are 'objectified' by oppressive social
relations they are also 'de-humanized', I offer that critical pedagogies
of praxis to confront global violence offer an educational project of
're-humanization'.

Krause and Latham suggest that in order to gain an insight into the
'logic of contemporary Western nuclear arms control and disarmament
policy, [[what is needed]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[is a research
programme that highlights]{.mark} the culturally derived shared images
providing [the structures of meaning within which Western diplomats and
policy-makers operate']{.mark}]{.underline}.133 They assert that a
'clear acknowledgement of the way in which the central elements of the
Western security culture are bound by history and deeply held beliefs
can alert policy-makers to the need to look for similar deeply held
beliefs or historical lessons that could be used to shape the evolution
of nuclear arms control and disarmament ideas in different regions and
contexts'.134 In this suggestion [[there is a presumption of ignorance
and innocence in understanding]{.mark} of history and culture [among
Western diplomats and policy-makers]{.mark}]{.underline} that once
rectified will enable the cultivation of better practices to address the
problems of NACD in different parts of the world. [[There is also
a]{.mark} tacit [endorsement of understanding]{.mark} that which might
be different, [from that which looks 'similar' to
oneself]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is an assumption that research will
discover 'culturally derived shared images' that will help articulate
meaning in parameters of practices within which Western policy-makers
operate. In this approach there is still an emphasis on 'Western NACD'
practices that need further analysis and elucidation and can then be
applied to other 'regions and contexts'.

#### Arms control debates must be framed in challenging hegemonic norms, securitization, and othering norms -- traditional "problem-solving" frameworks fail

**Cooper 06** \[Neil, 2006, Review of International Studies, "Putting
disarmament back in the frame", accessed 7/8/2019, DL\]

It is suﬃcient at this juncture to note that [[what
characterises]{.mark} this system of [arms limitation is the way]{.mark}
in which [it]{.mark} is structured to [consolidate and preserve the
military superiority of]{.mark} the US in particular and [the
West]{.mark} in general. Moreover, rather than reinforcing security
[this]{.mark} profound [military imbalance promotes insecurity]{.mark}
-- both [by creating incentives for other actors to pursue]{.mark}
asymmetric [technologies]{.mark} (NBC) [or strategies]{.mark}
(terrorism) [that oﬀset the US's]{.mark} conventional
[superiority]{.mark},35 [and by diverting resources]{.mark} that could
be expended [on human security to militarism]{.mark}. At best,
[the]{.mark} contemporary arms limitation [system aims to keep the lid
on]{.mark} such contradictions by setting in place a variety of
disciplinary mechanisms that attempt to constrain asymmetric military
responses whilst simultaneously preserving the asymmetrical advantages
of the West. At worst, [in attempting to contain pressures that
may]{.mark} ultimately [be uncontainable, the contemporary arms
limitation system may promote an illusion of relative security]{.mark}
[whilst positively fostering]{.mark} a variety of
[insecurities.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, a few more comments are in
order before we proceed to consider this system of asymmetrical arms
limitation in more detail.

Stuart Croft and arms control as threat construction

[[The corollary of the preceding critique of arms control theory
is]{.mark} of course [a requirement to develop conceptual
frameworks]{.mark} (and framings) [that are capable of]{.mark}
simultaneously [challenging the hegemonic discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}
within the discipline and of producing greater explanatory value. To
date this attempt has been most convincingly pursued by critical
theorists and postmodernists such as Mutimer,36 and Krause and Latham.37
Even within the mainstream literature on arms limitation however, there
has been some attempt to reconceptualise arms limitation practice. Most
notably, Stuart Croft in Strategies of Arms Control explicitly rejects
the distinction between arms control and disarmament as a basis for
framing discussions of arms limitation.38 Instead he develops a typology
based around ﬁve diﬀerent strategies of arms control: arms control at
the conclusion of major conﬂicts, arms control to strengthen strategic
stability, arms control to create norms of behaviour, arms control to
manage the proliferation of weapons and arms control by international
organisation.

This certainly represents an improvement on more traditional discussions
of arms limitation. However, there are also a number of problems with
his analysis. First, Croft locates his typology in a broader analysis
that emphasises the idea that arms control as an activity has been
constantly widening (in the sense that there has been a gradual
accretion of strategies deployed to achieve it) and that arms control
agreements have become ever 'deeper' (in the sense that agreements have
become more detailed, arrangements for veriﬁcation have become both more
common and more sophisticated, and the likelihood of agreements taking
on the qualities of a regime have increased). Consequently, although
Croft states that he is determined to avoid making judgements on the
success or failure of arms control both as theory and practice, he
nevertheless manages to produce a profoundly teleological (and indeed
optimistic) account of the history of arms control/arms limitation.

However, there has not been a straightforward accretion of arms
limitation activity. Partly this is because the relevance of many arms
control agreements has simply declined with the advent of new military
technology. But even where this has not been the case, politics and
power have constantly intruded both to kill oﬀ arms limitation
initiatives and to inﬂuence their depth. Examples include Japanese and
German disarmament after the Second World War, and the US decision to
renounce the ABM Treaty. Similarly, the two page SORT Treaty highlights
how the inexorable increase in depth described by Croft in 1996 was, at
best, a function of historically contingent Cold War practices rather
than some evolutionary manifest destiny.39

Second, Croft states that investigation of the motivation for arms
limitation is outside the remit of his book. Despite noting the inﬂuence
of politics and power on arms limitation then, what Croft presents is a
largely mechanistic and apolitical analysis of the subject. Indeed, the
development of arms limitation practice is depicted as an essentially
autonomous process -- as if, to paraphrase Cox, arms limitation were not
always for some purpose and for someone.40 This is not untypical of the
majority of the literature in this ﬁeld which tends to focus on the
technical minutiae of military strategy, diplomatic texts or policy
battles. [[The problems that arms limitation deals with are]{.mark}
generally taken as given and the purpose of such activity (just like
arms control theory itself) is [to engage in producing 'problemsolving'
solutions to these issues.]{.mark} What Croft, and mainstream arms
controllers in general ignore, is the role that arms limitation activity
plays in both reﬂecting broader constructions of threat and in
reinforcing them. Moreover, [whilst the idea that arms limitation
represents an arena where political power is exercised is taken as
axiomatic, power is generally understood to be expressed in the
relations between states]{.mark} (or internal bureaucracies)
[negotiating]{.mark} (or sometimes imposing) speciﬁc [treaties, and
measured in terms of who wins or loses]{.mark} in these
negotiations.]{.underline} The myriad ways in which hegemonic power is
expressed through developments in the dominant modes of arms limitation
thinking and practice rarely intrude. For example, [[the power
expressed]{.mark} as a result of the role played by discourse and action
over arms limitation [in aﬃrming hegemonic projects of securitisation;
the power manifested in]{.mark} the speciﬁc ways in [which the system of
arms limitation contributes to maintaining]{.mark} particular [military
and social hierarchie]{.mark}s whether internally, within the state, or
throughout the global system; [and the relationship between the
interests of power and the ways in which arms limitation reﬂects and
reinforces powerful]{.mark} political, economic and cultural [tools of
legitimation]{.mark}/delegitimation [surrounding military
technology.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In other words (from a critical security studies perspective at least),
[[the key questions surrounding arms limitation]{.mark} are not so much
who wins or loses in negotiations over a speciﬁc treaty or how
eﬀective/ineﬀective that treaty turns out to be. Rather, the principal
concern [is]{.mark} with [how the dominant discourse and practice of
arms limitation]{.mark} (not always the same thing) [contributes to
processes of securitisation and othering as well as military and broader
hegemonic practices]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Good examples of these processes at work are in fact cited by Croft
himself, but their implications are not followed through in his overall
analysis. For instance, the prohibition imposed by the Second Lateran
Council in 1139 on using crossbows against Christians and Catholics
reﬂected powerful processes of othering against non-christians who
remained exempt from a ban against what was otherwise depicted as 'that
deadly and God-detested art of slingers and archers'.41 At the same
time, the ban itself not only reﬂected the political power of the church
at the time, but its main purpose was actually to protect the nobility,
whose armour could be pierced by the crossbows wielded by the lower
class soldiery.42

[[The discourse on arms as objects of control is also intrinsically
linked to the shifting and symbiotic relationship between threat
construction and the legitimation of military technology and
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. This does not simply occur at the macro
level -- for example, in the ways that the discourses surrounding the
birth and then death of the ABM Treaty have reﬂected and reinforced
alternative constructions of threat (or indeed, of the utility of
nuclear deterrence when faced with thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons
compared with its utility when faced with nascent nuclear programmes in
North Korea and Iran).43 [[Even]{.mark} apparently [minor disputes over
language reﬂect shifting areas of contention between hegemonic and
counterhegemonic discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Thus, the use
of the appellation 'WMD' as a catch-all term to describe nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons (NBC) is often contested. In particular,
commentators have noted how this entails a particular categorisation
(and representation) of NBC weapons as equally (and uniquely)
horrifying, a categorisation that is either deemed too broad or too
restrictive depending on the observer. What is interesting about this
debate is not so much who is right and who is wrong but the way in which
the parties in this debate have changed over time and what this signiﬁes
about the link between representations of military technology, the
framing of the arms limitation agenda, and the interests of power. Thus,
in the 1950s and early 1960s a number of mainstream institutions and
academics were concerned to challenge the veracity of the term WMD,
whereas peace academics/activists were concerned to preserve it.
Consequently, the academic and peace activist Philip Noel-Baker could
bemoan US and NATO attempts to erode the link between nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons and to portray the latter two as 'normal and
legitimate means of war'.44 In contrast, Hedley Bull could note the
attempts of the US Chemical Corps to make chemical biological and
radiological (CBR) warfare respectable and could argue that when it came
to such weapons: 'it is misleading to regard them as forming, along with
nuclear weapons, a category of ''weapons of mass destruction'' . . . the
depiction of them as all alike peculiarly evil and terrifying is not
unquestionable'.45

among and within nation--states. [As long as there is **only a slight
risk** that it might, it is **necessary** that at least part of the
discipline of international relations theory adopt a **critical as
opposed to a defensive attitude** with respect to its major
assumptions]{.underline}. It is equally necessary that the other part
listen. Steven Forde observes that "[drawing on analyses of human
nature, on arguments about the necessary structure of international
relations, and on laws of political behavior derived from both these
sources, realists have quite frequently posed as the **clear-eyed
apostles of objective reason**, confronting the deluded idealism or
selfrighteous moralism of their fellow men]{.underline}."63 Certainly,
nobody, whether political scientist or policy maker, likes to be called
"deluded" or "self-righteous." However, [it]{.underline} also [seems a
likely dictate of "objective reason" that we should not threaten the
normative bases for communit y together with all hope for social
improvement for the sake of any **convenient paradigm of scientific
inquiry**.]{.underline} It is important to keep in mind that
"'[scientized realism' . . . presumes what actually needs
explaining."]{.underline}64 [Paradigmatic realism was, after all, born
from ideological realism and follows the Hobbesian strategy of
self-justification]{.underline}. As David Johnston has emphasized,
Hobbes's works are not designed merely to be academic exercises in
political theorizing, but to help persuade those who carry on conf licts
between parties and factions to instead seek accommodation and domestic
peace.65 As Robert Walker points out, [to modern realists, "Hobbes is
perhaps easier to read as a corroboration of the external necessities of
realpolitik, but only if his explicitly normative aspirations are read
naively, as the way things are]{.underline}."66 [In the service of
**ideological self-legitimation**, Hobbesian realism constructs "a myth
of origins in which individuals arise out of an **imaginary moment** of
utilitarian calculation: a fabulous story which continues to mesmerize
those economistic utilitarians seated obediently upon the patriarch's
knee]{.underline}."67 [The reason such a myth can]{.underline} actually
[become dangerous is that, when]{.underline} it is **[used as a
theoretical framework for the development of policy]{.underline}**, [the
constraints that are considered given for the purposes of analysis are
also **taken on faith as being given in empirical
settings**]{.underline}. We may not want to conclude with Robyn Dawes
that the claims social science makes about understanding human nature
are altogether unwarranted and it might be better to withhold all
judgment about it.68 However[, we should clearly allow for the
possibilit y that human nature might not be entirely static nor fully
determined by the dictates of rational egoism,]{.underline} but [that,
instead, human beings can and do develop "social" interests]{.underline}
along with cooperative patterns of interaction. In addition, [we should
counter the realist bias in political decision making by fighting **both
motivated and cognitive misperception**]{.underline}. [To do
so,]{.underline} in the words of Robert Jervis, [is to "increase
explicit and self-conscious judgment and decrease the extent to which
decision-makers **perceive without being aware of the alternatives that
are being rejected**.]{.underline}"69 [It is commonsensical to expect
the motivating power of fear]{.underline} to vary with actors'
perceptions of threat[. It is equally commonsensical to expect the
importance of relative power to vary with the degree of opposition an
actor expects in the pursuit of its goals]{.underline}. As Richard
Herrmann and his colleagues have put it, "\[O\]bviously, [if cognitive
perspectives develop only the enemy image, then they will need to assume
that all relationships are perceived in threat-based terms. This may be
consistent with the assumptions of neorealism, but fails to capture the
variation in both motivation and behavior that characterizes foreign
policies. . . . **Clearly other images and relationships should be
explored**]{.underline}**."**70 (152-4)

[In an effort to undertake this investigation [we]{.mark} begin by first
[tak]{.mark}ing [into account the contemporary discourses on
civilization in]{.mark} the field of [I]{.mark}nternational
[R]{.mark}elations]{.underline} articulated by leading thinkers such as
Samuel Huntington, Peter Katzenstein, and Robert Cox. It is the writings
of these scholars that have reached a large global audience and set the
terms of the debate among academics and policy-makers engaged with the
problem of weapons. The observations of these thinkers are then
juxtaposed with some key insights provided by postcolonial scholars
questioning the deployment of hegemonic discourses in security studies.
The next section buttresses these insights by deploying a contrapuntal
analysis to read representative historical narratives that trace the
trajectory of arms control and disarmament from the late 19th century to
the present. [This evolutionary trajectory of [arms control and
disarmament is disrupted]{.mark} in this text [to bring]{.mark} to the
fore [divisive practices that occurred during]{.mark} an era of
[colonization]{.mark}; during the period of [decolonization]{.mark} and
[the Cold War; and]{.mark} finally, during the period [after the Cold
War up to the present. These historical narratives reveal the colonial
mindset underpinning practices of arms control and disarmament and
disclose how the divisive binary of 'West and the Rest' is]{.mark}
constituted as [a part of]{.mark} the pervasive, popular, [everyday
jargon]{.mark} within the field of arms control and disarmament. It is
[this normalization]{.mark} that [is]{.mark} scrutinized further in the
third section as scholars suggest how to address [the problem of
civilization in arms control and disarmament]{.mark}. A study of the
deployment of civilizational practices by those that seek to maintain
the status quo, and the resistance offered by those that seek to change
it, will encourage reflexivity on the purposes and practices of arms
control and disarmament]{.underline}.

#### Broader assumptions more important than specifics of the 1AC

Violence]{.underline}, ed. Cooper & Mutimer)

[[My concern]{.underline}]{.mark} then, in the remainder of this
article, [[is not so much]{.underline}]{.mark} to interrogate [[the
success or failure of **particular**]{.mark} **humanitarian
[arms]{.mark} control [initiatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in terms of
their ability to produce]{.mark} **empirical [reductions]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the [availability]{.mark} and use of]{.underline} the
[particular weapons categories]{.underline} targeted for control.
Rather, [[it is to question]{.mark}]{.underline} the novelty of the
weapons taboos established by the HAC agenda, to examine the factors
that facilitate their production, and to interrogate the assumption that
taboos and even formal restraints on particular categories of
conventional weapons are unambiguously benevolent developments. Instead,
I will suggest that [[the current **regime of truth**]{.mark}
constructed around humanitarian arms control is not only extraordinarily
ahistorical but is one that depends on a rather **partial
understanding** of the way the relationship between power, ethics, and
specific models of economy have been expressed throughout the history of
arms trade regulation.]{.underline}

### A2 case outweighs

#### The aff assumes two fallacies: one, when there's peace, there's no violence and two, they can solve for peace by ignoring the root cause.

[Violence as a possible outgrowth of the notion of peace predominant in
the mainstream--that is, [peace as absence of]{.mark} [war--is an
insight long assumed]{.mark} in peace research and conflict
studies]{.underline}. In this view, content with the mere absence of
"tangible" conflict, this less than sufficient notion of peace serves
effectively to cover up violence that is perpetuated at a deeper level.
[Johan Galtung famously designated [this deep-seated violence]{.mark}
that [is]{.mark} part and parcel of the prevailing order as "[structural
violence]{.mark}." Voiceless, extant in relatively "tranquil waters," as
he puts it, [structural violence is]{.mark} perceived in everyday life
almost "[as natural as the air around us]{.mark}." 26 This invisible
violence is formed by a broad configuration of forces in society
responsible for generation myriad forms of inequality. Not interested in
this violence systemically produced, the conventional notion, dubbed
"[negative peace]{.mark}" by Galtung, [needs to be]{.mark} recognized as
simply [complicit in the ongoing violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Genuine
peace, what Galtung calls "positive peace," on the other hand, is a
clear departure from the established stance. Positive peace--peace that
is more than the mere absence of war--is peace that seeks to put an end
to, or is at least motivated by an awareness of, the continuing
structural violence.

This is a notion of violence linked to peace, peace as absence of war,
that treats the power behind violence exclusively as potestas, as the
power to control, in the Spinozist sense, as noted in the preceding
section of this article, rather than potential, as the elusive,
primordial power that is inevitably constitutive right, of the law, and,
hence, of peace. Subsequently, power understood exclusively as potestas,
as tangible power, enables an envisioning of the total evasion of power
and of its consequences. A direct result of this failure to incorporate
in a register of violence the more primordial, constitutive
power­--namely, power as potential, is the distinction between positive
and negative peace, a binary that not only places the argument by
Galtung within the otherwise refuted prevailing order via a metaphysics
of presence but also, and perversely, transforms the argument into an
ideology that functions to conceal a "deeper" level of violence that
comes with power as potential. Just as the repudiated, negative peace
ignores power that is not tangible. [Yet, [peace in any form is]{.mark}
ultimately [a regime of rights and privileges]{.mark} precisely [for
being generated by structures of power, which]{.mark} in turn, and
ineluctably, [issue types of "structural violence]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[Violence becomes attached to peace at a primordial level because, in
the first place, shaped by power as potential, peace is that which is
fixed]{.underline}. This is a characteristic of the notion conveyed and
reinforced in the etymology of the Latin root of the word, as pax,
peace, which stems from the verb pangere, "to fix." That which is fixed,
as communicated in this notion, effectively suppresses that which is not
fixed, or that which is excluded. That is, whatever regime is introduced
through peace, always and already this regime will manifest itself as
that which it is at the cost of what it is not, hiding various tensions
that will critically distinguish it in the final analysis. It will be a
regime of inclusion and exclusion, and inevitably an arbitrary,
power-generated one at that. This regime will in turn function as
pacification, as forced tranquility, as suppression, a sense of the term
peace as suggested in to keep \[or hold\] one's peace.
[[Tranquility]{.mark}, a form of which seems to be the objective of
peace generally, may [in turn exact a toll costlier than]{.mark}
outright, [plain violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. To recall the testimony
of Rousseau on the dilemma of inaction achieved in peace, this
tranquility, valorized to no end in the conventional peace thinking, may
itself have to be treated as one of the forms, if not the form, of
violence at the root of human misery. "Men live tranquilly also in
dungeons," Rousseau writes; "Is that enough to make them contented
there? The Greeks confined in the cave of the Cyclops lived peacefully
until their turn came to be devoured." 27 The peace Rousseau speaks of
is the "civil peace," as he names it in the same passage; namely, the
authority constitutive of the state fostered through a monopoly on the
legitimate use of violence per Weber. 28 [[This monopoly]{.mark}, and
the pacification achieved by it, understood along the lines indicated by
Rousseau, [is]{.mark} arguably a primordial, [generalized
violence]{.mark} that produces, or defines, and is in each and every
case prior to, both "conflict" (namely, the everyday, illicit violence)
and "peace" (violence that is acceptable]{.underline}).

[Disciplinarian by definition, [civil peace]{.mark} that forms, or
secures, state authority [is]{.mark} then [inevitably violent]{.mark}.
International peace, the benevolent peace that ends interstate,
intercommunal conflict, may not necessarily be different. In the first
place, let us remember that [international peace]{.mark} almost always
[builds on the domestic, centralized violence]{.mark} that marks civil
peace, emerging as a contract that relies on state
authority]{.underline}. That is, international peace comes about mostly
through the agency of the state, which originates in civil peace, the
pacification at the domestic level. International peace may therefore be
argued to be ultimately an extension of civil peace. Played out between
states, international peace as such is fundamentally a function and a
projection of the domestic monopoly of violence. Simultaneously, it
seems to be an unmistakable confirmation of the dungeon tranquility
described by Rousseau, for international peace is, among other things, a
bonding of states, bordering on what is practically an interstate
conspiracy to hush up, legitimize, and consolidate the domestic peace,
the authority, that defines each and every one of them.

A well-understood manifestation of this power is the power of ideology
in interstate relations in its normalizing, domesticating effect, via
knowledge, of peace, produced in alignment with power. [This effect not
only conceals a structure of power and domination that is at work but
also seeks constantly to reproduce and maintain that structure. By this
account, the assorted spectacles of peace, from the victor's peace to
the more recent purportedly non-state-led peace, may have to be
considered as simply "discourses" of peace, indicating various
governmentalities in historically specific alignments of power and
peace]{.underline}. This is a view of peace that departs markedly from
the mainstream vision in which diverse discourses are perceived as
phases in an evolving, progressive, Whig-like line of increasing freedom
from violence and increasing emancipation. The mainstream assumption is
in full keeping with the liberal postulate of tenable social harmony, a
society conceivably at peace with itself.

# \*\*\*AFF versus Weaponitis\*\*\*

### 2AC Weaponitis cards

#### Weapons matter -- they incite desire in people, thus producing the users

**Meiches**, professor at UW Tacoma and focuses on armed conflict,
genocide, and international law, **17'**, \[Benjamin Meiches, "Weapons,
desire, and the making of war", Critical Studies on Security, 13-15,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149>, Acc: 7.6.19, A.N.M.\]

This section develops a theory of weapon agency based in the work of JFC
Fuller, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and a number of other
contemporary theorists of violence[. It suggests that [weapons are
defined by distinctive]{.mark} affective [potentials,]{.mark} [which
exert]{.mark} formative [influence on social life]{.mark} rather than
passive instruments of violence.]{.underline} The section-uses this
[theory to demonstrate that [weapons do not merely impact human
calculations or facilitate politicsal violence, but actively contribute
to the production of]{.mark} subjectivity and, as a consequence,
security and [warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} Drawing together Fuller's
understanding of war instruments with Deleuze and Guattari's
[appreciation for the independence of objects provides an important
avenue for interpreting the affective implications of weaponry as a
distinct form of object.]{.underline} Indeed, as JFC Fuller puts it
nearly a century ago: 'From the javelin and the arrow to the
super-fortress and the rocket-bomb, [[the very power to]{.mark}
[destroy]{.mark}\... [has intoxicated]{.mark} man']{.underline} (Fuller
1998, x). Fuller adds a post-human twist: '[[We are entranced by their
cunning, their power and precision, also by the things they give us and
the profits we reap by means of them]{.mark}. Yet, how they influence
us, as living creatures, is left uncalculated']{.underline} (x--xi).
Fuller's description [notes the [various qualities]{.mark} of weapons
such as sublimity, cunning, and power, which [draw humans to
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Set next to this complex account of the
influences of weapons on 'living creatures', Fuller's definition of the
weapon as 'an instrument with striking power' seems reductive (16).
However, [this definition of weaponry offers a valuable starting point
to [theorise the capacity of weapons to incite
desire]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Deleuze and Guattari make a similar observation that weapons have a
privileged relationship to processes of propulsion in contrast to a
tool's introjective model of force (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Weapons
expend energy in relation to an exterior milieu whereas tools conserve
energy in the process of building a territory. The notion that a weapon
has a 'striking power' captures how the 'flight' of ballistics expels
force while the 'blow' of the hammer preserves it for another use.
Deleuze and Guattari further differ- entiate weapons and tools in terms
of the vectors of speed and gravity, free action and work, and
expression with jewellry rather than the order-words and signs
(396--401). These distinctions constitute the series of differential
relations that characterise a particular assemblage, which acts as the
formal cause of the weapons and tools distinc- tion. As they put it,
'the principle behind all technology is to demonstrate that a technical
element remains abstract, entirely undetermined, as long as one does not
relate it to an assemblage it presupposes \... weapons and tools are
consequences, nothing but consequences' (398--399).

The philosophers further distinguish tools and weapons by examining
different 'compositions of desire' as a defining aspect of both entities
(Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 399). By compositions of desire, they refer
to the peculiar forms of passion, drive, and meaning that glue weapons
and tools together. [With respect to desire, they argue that tools
presuppose a form of 'introspective feeling' while weapons operate as
'projectile affects'. [Affects discharge emotions and]{.mark}, as such,
[resonate with the explosive properties of the weapon while the tool
remains apathetic to the work it performs.]{.mark}]{.underline} These
differences are so stark that Deleuze and Guattari declare: 'weapons are
affects and affects weapons' (400).

This observation is critical because the affective capacities of weapons
and the weaponisation of affects take many forms. For instance, as
architect Léopold Lambert argues, the destructive expenditure unleashed
by weapons includes affective 'operation- \[s\] in which physical bodies
are being "broken down" into smaller material assemblages'. As Lambert
describes the process, an explosion is not defined by temporality or
speed, but by an exothermic reaction latent in a bomb's chemical
components. In a materialist sense, the exothermic reaction 'destroys'
by releasing forces that divide assemblages of one scale into
assemblages of another (Lambert 2013). In this sense, the weapon's
affective power consists of 'striking' organic and inorganic compounds
at a chemical level in order to deform them. Other weapons work
similarly. Swords cleave flesh, bullets pierce armour, and bombs produce
rubble and debris (Gordillo 2014). These affective 'striking' properties
of the weapon operate on multiple levels. [[Prior to detonating or
piercing, the process of targeting or even possessing]{.mark} [weapons
also discharges affects]{.mark} [that]{.mark} reconstitute somatic
postures, social narratives, and [incites other emotive responses such
as fear or terror]{.mark}]{.underline}. In order to account for the
affective power of weapons, I argue that contemporary understanding of
'striking power' needs to be expanded to include the capacity for
material agencies to divide and reconstitute habits and imaginaries.

Many traditional theories of weapons, such as nuclear deterrence,
implicitly presup- pose affective 'striking power' to describe the
function of weapons. For instance, a gap exists between the destructive
potential of weapons and the more limited, actual use of weapons. This
gap between actual and potential use produces a communicative differ-
ence, which relies entirely on affective force. Typically understood as
a form of threat, the gap between what weapons could do and what they
actually do sends signals between parties. These signals enable new
mechanisms of force, such as coercion, by affectively shifting the
habits of a targeted or vulnerable party. However, the possibility of
these affective signals depends on the weapons \'striking power,\' which
impacts a person or stated affected by a weapon prior to an explosion or
physical impact. Threat is thus a byproduct of the latent potential of
\'striking power.\'The entire concepts of threat gestures or postures
thus presuppose the affective capacity of the weapon, but they are not
the only products of this gap. For example, the difference between the
potential and actual use of weapons also establishes the distinctions
critical for laws and norms of war, but may also signal superiority in
battle or a different organisation of combat (DeLanda 2005). The
'striking power' of weapons consequently induces complex affects that
befall both human embodiment and relations of desire in ways that are
difficult to predeter- mine. Hence, the destructive aspects of weapons
constitute only a set of the affective relations that link humans and
weapons. [[Weapons similarly 'strike' humans in the form of obsessions,
profit, or art; weapons enchant, glimmer, and terrify.]{.mark} Arguably,
these affects also comprise forms of 'striking power' in the broad sense
of rearticulating the affective relations between bodies. [By forming
new kinds of desire, weapons also produce their
users.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### There is no trade-off between proximate reductions and interrogation of root cause -- vote to solve specific scenarios and make progress toward peace

**Quester** **'89** (George H., ChairGov&Politics@Maryland,
International-Security Criticisms of Peace Research The Annals of the
American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 504,Peace
Studies: Past and Future (Jul., 1989), pp. 98-105)

[[Advocates]{.underline}]{.mark} of peace research sometimes [justify
their approach by [assert]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [[they alone are
addressing the]{.mark} ultimate or [root causes]{.mark} of
conflict]{.underline}. Unless one eliminates injustice or racism or
prejudice or tyranny, they contend, there can never be a real peace or
positive peace. [This argument runs the risk]{.underline}, however, [of
becoming a play on words]{.underline}. [[Real peace]{.mark} can mean
that we approve of every step of the causal chain,]{.underline} going
back as far as it can be traced, [which [might]{.mark} indeed [be
ideal]{.mark}; [but]{.mark} this might [hardly]{.mark} be so [essential
for someone caught in the crossfire]{.mark} of Beirut,
someone]{.underline} **[who is merely pleading and praying that the
shooting might stop]{.underline}**. [To imply]{.underline} that a
[**termination of conventional** war and an **avoidance of nuclear war**
and an abatement of terrorism are **not somehow real would** be to blur
our understanding of a great deal of what most men and women indeed care
about.]{.underline} Similarly, [[to refer to]{.mark} such an
absence]{.underline} of warfare [as \"[negative
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}\"-as compared with something more positive in
\"positive peace\"-[[is to use these words]{.underline}]{.mark} of our
English language [[in a manner that substantially underrates the human
priority of eliminating warfare, whatever its causes and whatever the
remedy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Critics of peace studies would thus come
back to argue that these [ultimate]{.underline} and genuine [reforms of
human arrangements]{.underline} for which peace researchers claim such
priority [are]{.underline} all well and [good, but]{.underline} that
[these **may not be capable of being attained in anything less than
several centuries**.]{.underline} [[Rather than eliminating all
ideological suspicions]{.underline}]{.mark} between Marxists and
non-Marxists [or eliminating all ethnic dislikes]{.underline} between
Greeks and Turks, [[would it not be a major accomplishment in the
meantime to eliminate]{.mark} those kinds of [weapons that tend to make
wars]{.mark} between such contending factions more likely, and to stress
instead the defensive types that discourage military forces from
launching attacks? [Peace researchers]{.mark} then often [reply
that]{.mark} any such resignation to [intermediate and proximate
improvements]{.mark}]{.underline} [[implies a **welcoming of permanent
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} or even a relishing of it [or at least
an assumption that conflict and hostility are]{.underline} in the
[natural]{.underline} order of things. [[But]{.mark} the real issue is
surely much more one of **whether [certain kinds of improvements can be
made]{.mark} over certain ranges of time.**]{.underline} (103-4)

#### Policy key -- the alt fails -- changing representational practices hinders understanding of policy by overlooking questions of agency and material structures

**Tuathail '96** (Gearoid, Department of Georgraphy at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, Political Geography, 15(6-7), p. 664, science
direct)

[[While theoretical debates]{.mark} at academic conferences [are
important to academics, the discourse and concerns of foreign-policy
decision- makers are quite different]{.mark}, so different that they
constitute a distinctive problem- solving, theory-averse, policy-making
subculture. There is a danger that [academics assume that the discourses
they engage are more significant in the practice of foreign policy and
the exercise of power than they really are]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
not, however, to minimize the obvious importance of academia as a
general institutional structure among many that sustain certain
epistemic communities in particular states. In general, I do not
disagree with Dalby's fourth point about politics and discourse except
to note that his statement-'Precisely because reality could be
represented in particular ways political decisions could be taken,
troops and material moved and war fought'-evades the important question
of agency that I noted in my review essay. [[The assumption that]{.mark}
it is [representations]{.mark} that [make action possible is inadequate
by itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. Political, military and economic
structures, institutions, discursive networks and leadership are all
crucial in explaining social action and should be theorized together
with representational practices. Both here and earlier, Dalby's
reasoning inclines towards a form of idealism. In response to Dalby's
fifth point (with its three subpoints), it is worth noting, first, that
his book is about the CPD, not the Reagan administration. He analyzes
certain CPD discourses, root the geographical reasoning practices of the
Reagan administration nor its public-policy reasoning on national
security. Dalby's book is narrowly textual; the general contextuality of
the Reagan administration is not dealt with. Second, let me simply note
that I find that the distinction between critical theorists and post-
structuralists is a little too rigidly and heroically drawn by Dalby and
others. Third, Dalby's interpretation of the reconceptualization of
national security in Moscow as heavily influenced by dissident peace
researchers in Europe is highly idealist, an interpretation that ignores
the structural and ideological crises facing the Soviet elite at that
time. Gorbachev's reforms and his new security discourse were also
strongly self- interested, an ultimately futile attempt to save the
Communist Party and a discredited regime of power from disintegration.
The issues raised by Simon Dalby in his comment are important ones for
all those interested in the practice of critical geopolitics. While I
agree with Dalby that questions of discourse are extremely important
ones for political geographers to engage, [[there is a danger of
fetishizing this concern with discourse so that we neglect the
institutional]{.underline}]{.mark} and the sociological, the materialist
and the cultural, the political and the geographical contexts within
which particular discursive strategies become significant. Critical
geopolitics, in other words, should not be a prisoner of the sweeping
ahistorical cant that sometimes accompanies 'poststructuralism nor
convenient reading strategies like the identity politics narrative; it
needs to always be open to the patterned mess that is human history.

#### Human nature makes realism inevitable -- there is no escaping global contours of war and violence.

**Morgenthau '98** \-- Hans Morgenthau, Professor of Political Science
and Director of the Center for the Study of American Foreign Policy at
the University of Chicago, Winter 1998, Naval War College Review 51.1,
p. 16, ebsco.

This is another example of the belief that the difficulties which
confront us, the risks which threaten us, the liabilities which we must
face in international affairs are the result of some kind of ephemeral,
unique configuration; that if you do away with the latter you will have
done away with the liabilities, the risks, and the difficulties as well.
This belief is mistaken; for [it is the very essence of historic
experience that whenever you have disposed of one danger in foreign
policy another one is going to raise its head. Once we had disposed of
the Axis as a threat to American security, we were right away confronted
with a new threat]{.underline}: the threat of [the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. I daresay if we could, by some kind of miracle, do
away tomorrow with the threat which emanates from the Soviet Union, we
would very soon be confronted again with a new threat\--and perhaps from
a very unexpected quarter. [[At the foundation of the realist\'s
approach]{.mark} to foreign policy there [is the conviction that the
struggle for power on the international scene]{.mark}]{.underline}\--as
the struggle for power on all levels of social interaction\--[[is
not]{.mark} the result of [some historic accident]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[of some passing]{.underline}]{.mark} social, constitutional, legal, or
economic [[configuration]{.underline}]{.mark} (think, for instance, of
the utopian expectations of Marxism), [[but that it is part and parcel
of **human nature itself**]{.mark}; that the aspirations for power are
innate in human nature; that [it is futile to search for a]{.mark}
mechanical [device]{.mark} with which [to eliminate those
aspirations]{.mark}; that the wise approach to political problems lies
in taking the perennial character of those aspirations for granted\--in
trying to live with them, to redirect them into socially valuable and
beneficial channels, to transform them, to civilize them]{.underline}.
This is as much as a man can do with this psychological and social
heritage, which he cannot escape. In other words, [a realistic approach
to foreign policy starts with the assumption that **[international
politics is of necessity a struggle for power]{.mark}**]{.underline};
that the balance of power, for instance, is not the invention of some
misguided diplomats but is the inevitable result of a multiplicity of
nations living with each other, competing with each other for power, and
trying to maintain their autonomy. Now let me turn to some practical
problems which illustrate the characteristics of realism in foreign
policy as over against the utopian or idealistic approach. Take, again,
the balance of power. [The balance of power]{.underline}, you may say,
[is for foreign policy what the law of gravity is for
nature]{.underline}; that is, it is the very essence of foreign policy.
I remember very well that when I used the term "balance of power" at the
beginning of my academic career in the early 30\'s I met with an
unfavorable reaction. "Balance of power" was then a kind of dirty
word\--something which respectable scholars would not use, at least not
in an affirmative sense. It was something not to be investigated, not to
be practiced; it was something to be abolished. I remember again very
well a lecture I gave in Milwaukee (I think it was in 1944) in which I
made the point I just made: that when the war was over there would of
necessity be a new balance of power, a new set of problems which we
would have to solve\--and that more likely than not it would be the
Soviet Union which would raise the problems. Many in the audience seemed
to believe that I was a kind of Fascist agent who was trying to
perpetuate an evil that they were just in the process of getting rid of.

### 2AC Militarism

#### Militarism is mistaken as the complete opposite of what it is. Militarism is key to developing important relationships and understanding the everyday.

These articles and Encounters pieces all illustrate what it might mean
to understand the concepts of militarism, militarization, and war,
through the concept of embodiment. [[This **challenges**]{.mark}
prevailing ideas of [how militarism is]{.mark} often [understood as an
ideology **disconnected** from the embodied self and the
everyday]{.mark}. Discussions raised in these contributions trouble the
binaries of insider/outsider and civilian/military in various productive
ways, offering an understanding of [militarism]{.mark} and war that [is
responsive to]{.mark} the complex and [**interconnected** ways]{.mark}
in which they colour all our lives. With a view to [**neither
privileging** the 'mind' over the 'body', nor treating these as
**disparate entities**, the contributions rather analyse how embodiment
is a term that captures the intricate webs spun amongst senses,
emotions, experience, individuality, and
collectivity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC Perm cards -- human rights

#### Human rights framing is the most pragmatic challenge to the violence of war 

**Smith, PhD, 10**

(Thomas W., Gov&IntlAffairs@SouthFlorida, Can Human Rights Build a
Better War?, Journal of Human Rights, 9:1, 24-44)

"[Humanity's law]{.underline}," Ruti Teitel's felicitous term for the
marriage of human rights law and the laws ofwar, [is notable for its
ambivalence]{.underline}. "[The most pronounced change]{.underline} in
the international legal system," wrote Teitel, [is "the **dramatic
expansion** of humanitarian law's reach through its merger with
international human rights law]{.underline}" (Teitel 2002: 359). This
confluence of norms is widely seen as a tribute to the power of human
rights. Thus [even war, the most sovereign of prerogatives, is **not
immune** to]{.underline} the attractions of [what]{.underline} Zbigniew
[Brzezinski called "the **single most magnetic political idea** of the
contemporary time]{.underline}" (Forsythe 2006: 34). [Human rights and
war law speak in one voice]{.underline} with respect to genocide and
crimes against humanity, torture, and terrorism. [Landmines and chemical
weapons have been banned, human rights courts masquerade as war crimes
courts]{.underline}, and [humanitarian rhetoric infuses the conduct of
modern warfare]{.underline}. [State reciprocity has begun to **cede to
global norms**]{.underline}, [legal rules are increasingly recognizable
to human rights, and **accountability** has been
strengthened.]{.underline} While humanity's law is a model of
humanitarian norms, [they are norms of a certain kind, dealing with
gross rather than "ordinary" abuses,]{.underline} tending to criminalize
low-tech violence rather than hi-tech violence, and legalizing military
necessity on the battlefield. [The strategic utility of
violence,]{.underline} a principle that is carefully tended in the laws
of war but that rests uneasily with human rights, [comes through
unscathed]{.underline}; indeed it may be legitimized by its association
with rights[. Critics say]{.underline} the [human rights]{.underline}
movement has [got]{.underline}ten [too comfortable with the exercise of
military power]{.underline} in its calls for forcible humanitarian
intervention and "robust peacekeeping." Under the tutelage of
humanitarian law, human rights may grow accustomed to military norms
governing the use of force as well, narrowing the ideals of human rights
to fit the pragmatics and apologetics of war law. Although human rights
courts and commissions render "human rights" readings of humanitarian
law, [the **comparative advantage of** human rights]{.underline} [is
not]{.underline} necessarily [to]{.underline} do a [better]{.underline}
job of [apply]{.underline}ing [the laws of war]{.underline}, or to hold
belligerents to ever more rigorous readings of the Geneva Conventions.
What human rights does uniquely well [is to address the broad-based
effects of conflict and to **develop alternatives to war
itself.**]{.underline} As modern militaries increasingly adopt the
language of humanitarianism, the challenge for human rights may be to
preserve its normative and political independence in the face of "humane
war." (24-5)

#### Critics trade policy relevance for principle-human rights framing is powerful enough to challenge the logic of war 

**Smith, PhD, 10**

(Thomas W., Gov&IntlAffairs@SouthFlorida, Can Human Rights Build a
Better War?, Journal of Human Rights, 9:1, 24-44)

First, if "strategy" and "victory" come to inhabit human rights, the
merger of the regimes takes on a darker cast. [Rather than complement
the laws of war, human rights may bow to them]{.underline}. It is
sometimes said that human rights and humanitarian law speak different
languages (see, e.g., Lubell 2005). But [human rights activists
increasingly engage the military on military terms.]{.underline} [This
garners them **"relevance**" in the eyes of **policymakers** and real,
if limited, influence over the conduct of war, but the strategy can
muffle the message of human rights. The antiwar wing]{.underline} of the
human rightsmovement [has been especially skeptical of this
turn]{.underline}. Karima Bennoune, a former legal advisor for Amnesty
International, says that among human rights organizations IHL has become
"the primary, sometimes sole, mode of analysis of armed conflicts"
(Bennoune 2004: 173). David Kennedy suggests, conversely, that it is the
language of human rights that has been militarized. "Humanitarians
increasingly provide the terms in which global power is exercised.We
speak the same language as those who plan and fight wars, the language
of humanitarian objectives and proportional, even humane means" (Kennedy
2006: 132). At best, this results in confusion, as the constituents of
human rights and IHL use the same vocabulary to talk about different
things. At worst, the utility of violence is smuggled into human rights,
undercutting the philosophical as well as the political cause of the
movement. This "displacement of the established human rights vocabulary
by that of the law of war," notes Tietel (2002: 375), "goes to the very
heart of the meaning of 'human rights.'"(26)

[If these are the pitfalls]{.underline} of humanity's law, [the power of
human rights to protect civilians]{.underline} caught in war **[lies in
its absoluteness and autonomy]{.underline}**. While human rights bodies
may lack expertise in humanitarian law, "their very idealism and
na¨ıvet´e, however, are their greatest strength" (Meron 2000: 247). One
can envision a human rights reading of many of the principles of IHL.
Such an approach begins with an appreciation that there is room for
human rights. As Louise Doswald-Beck (2006: 882) notes, IHL is not
"crystal clear as to when and how force can be used in all areas of
armed conflict." [Facts]{.underline} as well as the application and
interpretation [of law often are in dispute]{.underline}. The idea "that
the nature of the threat and the resulting circumstances within which
force is applied will ultimately govern the choice of that framework" is
less straightforward than it sounds (Watkin 2004: 22). [Threats are
notoriously indeterminate]{.underline}. [**Naturally skeptical** of the
exercise of state power, unfettered by military mores]{.underline}, and
singularly humanitarian in aim, [human rights can **defend the
continuity of rights in extreme times**]{.underline}, [set frankly
higher standards required to infringe the right to life
(]{.underline}"absolute necessity" in the case of the European Court of
Human Rights) [and show greater skepticism toward the recourse to
war]{.underline} and distrust, perhaps [even incredulity, toward
military claims regarding the conduct of operations]{.underline}.As
Bennoune (2004: 174) notes, "clearly, the human impact of an armed
conflict is much larger than a sum of violations of the Geneva
Conventions." [Human rights brings the long-term and **cumulative
impacts of war into focus**]{.underline} in a way that IHL cannot[,
highlighting the terrorization of populations **even by lawful
attacks,**]{.underline} [pressing for **accountability for war
policies**, and raising basic questions about the militarization of
societies and economies]{.underline}. (28-9)

#### Human rights framing can effectively challenge modern justifications for war 

**Shaw, PhD, 02**

(Martin, IREmeritus@Sussex, Risk-transfer militarism, small massacres
and the historic legitimacy of war. International Relations, 16 (3). pp.
343-359. ISSN 1741-2862)

In an age of [human rights]{.underline}, this [concern for individuals
is in principle extended to]{.underline} individual [civilians,
and]{.underline} may even begin to apply to [enemy soldiers]{.underline}
too. After all, concern about illegitimate killing has been magnified in
the justification of recent wars: where they are not actually proclaimed
to halt human rights abuses, as in Kosovo, they may well be designed to
punish the perpetrators of killing against innocent civilians, as after
9/11. Alongside these wars there are legal proceedings: the activities
of the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) were
ratcheted up during the Kosovo War, and some at least of the al- Qaida
captives will face criminal cases (and there is evident inconsistency
and embarrassment in the US attempts to keep the Guantanamo Bay
prisoners away from the courts). Not surprisingly, the ICTY felt obliged
to consider the case against NATO itself for its 'accidental' massacres
of civilians in Serbia and Kosovo. The report of the Committee it
established made a case that there is no prima facie basis for formally
investigating NATO's conduct of that war. Whether, in terms of the
current law of war, that was a correct conclusion is not my concern
here. What is clear is that NATO could be held accountable, in principle
at least, for the deaths of the civilian victims. [What was driving the
demand for justice was not so much the legal norms as the perception
that all the individual lives mattered]{.underline}: the three people
killed in the Chinese embassy, the 16 killed in the Serbian TV station,
the 70 killed when a railway bridge was bombed, and so on. Incidents as
small as traffic accidents, in terms of numbers of victims, could be
matters for which the world's most powerful state could be brought to
account, and in basically the same way. No wonder that the US is
concerned about the establishment of the International Criminal Court.
The laws of war were never intended to be applied in criminal courts in
this manner. The drive to do this stems from general trends towards
intensified legal regulation, heightened awareness of individual rights
and extensive litigation - trends that derive much of their momentum
(ironically) from US society. But [criminalization involves treating war
like any other human activity**, no longer de facto or even de jure
excluded** from norms that apply in all other fields.]{.underline}
[Taking 'Thou shalt not kill' seriously]{.underline}, in the context of
war, does indeed [threaten to make the practice of war very
difficult]{.underline}. [If the means of war are]{.underline} generally
**[picked over with a fine toothcomb]{.underline}**, in the courts, in
the press and (indeed) **[in academia,]{.underline}** then **[the
legitimacy of war will be regularly undermined]{.underline}**. [It is
**difficult,**]{.underline} therefore, [to resist the conclusion that
the door has been **fundamentally opened to new kinds of
delegitimation** of war]{.underline}. Regardless of Western governments'
success in mobilising media and public opinion in particular cases, like
the opening phase of the 'war on terrorism', [the new Western way of war
is generally **vulnerable to new criticisms**]{.underline} [that
will]{.underline}, sooner or later, [challenge its **even its newly
refined** justifications]{.underline}. The failure of any of the
transfers of risk could expose the West to risk rebound. If airpower is
insufficient to break the enemy, if the local forces are incapable of
carrying out ground operations - or if they commit too many atrocities -
or if the fickle media turn away from their would-be masters, the risks
of the new mode of war will return to the West. In the 1960s, 1970s and
1980s, it appeared that war was fundamentally compromised by the
tendency of 'limited' wars like Vietnam, as well as of large-scale
\'conventional\' and nuclear war, to produce large numbers of civilian
casualties. Since the 1990s, Western governments and militaries have
developed a new mode that seems to have overcome this problem. What I
have tried to show in this paper is that [alongside this new mode have
come new bases for criticising war.]{.underline} The legacy of
degenerate war can still be identified in disparities of risk: [war\'s
legitimacy can be challenged through even the smallest episodes of
killing. Historical pacifism, though challenged by the reinvention of
war, is being renewed, as the tests for justly killing get ever
tighter]{.underline}. (13-16)

#### Human rights framing shifts debate from intentions to consequences- crucial to challenge "collateral damage" 

**Smith, PhD, 10**

(Thomas W., Gov&IntlAffairs@SouthFlorida, Can Human Rights Build a
Better War?, Journal of Human Rights, 9:1, 24-44)

The law of [war tends to focus on]{.underline} individual
**[intentions,]{.underline}** while [human rights addresses the **actual
impact** of wartime acts]{.underline}. As Koller (2005: 245) notes,
"human [rights theory does not provide a list of principles]{.underline}
guiding action, [but rather a list of ends]{.underline} to be attained."
Indeed, [h]{.underline}uman [r]{.underline}ights [is silent on the means
and methods of warfare]{.underline}; [what matters is the upshot, not
the tactics, of state power]{.underline} (Rowe 2007: 118). The [laws of
war bar direct, intended attacks on civilians, but they do not outlaw
killing]{.underline}, even widespread killing under other circumstances.
The modern theory of [collateral damage rests on the]{.underline}
philosophical concept known as "[double effect," which
distinguishes]{.underline} between those [consequences]{.underline} that
are [intended and those that are,]{.underline} as it is usually put,
"[merely" foreseen.]{.underline} What matters from a moral and legal
standpoint is that only the good effects are intended. As Paul Ramsey
argued (1968: 145), the principle of discrimination "never supposed that
\[noncombatants\] were to be roped off like ladies at a medieval
tournament." [Even fully anticipated death is permitted "on however
colossal a scale."]{.underline} "There is a significant moral difference
between the destruction in obliteration warfare which is deliberately
wanton and murderous, and the destruction and death that is among the
tragic consequences of counter-forces warfare. This distinction is not
determined by the amount of the devastation or the number of deaths, but
by the direction of the action itself" (Ramsey 1968: 153--154). [This
is,]{.underline} to say the least, [a **slippery** view of
intentions]{.underline}. Just [think of the history of aerial
bombing.]{.underline} If the killing of noncombatants is foreseen---even
"foreknown" or carried out with "certain knowledge" of its consequences,
to use Ramsey's language---by going forward with the act do we not
intend the consequence? [From the standpoint of human rights, it is
violence against civilians whether or not they are the intended
targets]{.underline}. (31-2)

### 1AR weapons are inciting

#### Weapons transform subjectivity, stimulate desire, and redefine self

**Meiches**, professor at UW Tacoma and focuses on armed conflict,
genocide, and international law, **17'**, \[Benjamin Meiches, "Weapons,
desire, and the making of war", Critical Studies on Security, 13-15,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149>, Acc: 7.6.19, A.N.M.\]

There are several ways to understand how [[weapons]{.mark} affectively
[mold subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Each perspective or model
explores a different mode of encounter between weapons and humans, which
reflects slightly distinct theoretical commitments regarding the role
weapons (or things) play in social life]{.underline}. The first mode of
encounter [concerns [weapons]{.mark}' ability to [augment and transform
human imagination]{.mark}. Put simply, weapons [introduce the
possibility for imagining otherwise by extending the capacities of human
beings]{.mark}]{.underline}. This interpretation adds a minimal degree
of weapon agency into the dominant expla- nation of weapons as tools.
[In this model, [weapons]{.mark} only a[lter operations of thought by
introducing new possibilities that change human designs, strategies, and
aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, Sven Lindqvist
subscribes to this model in his illustration of how the develop- ment of
bombing prompted the emergence of fantasies of mass murder and genocide
(2003, 31, 71, 126). [Here, [the weapon contributes to the remaking of
the world-image]{.mark} [and]{.mark}, by doing so, both [endow]{.mark}
weapon [possessors with a sense of omnipotence that necessitates certain
exercises in political violence]{.mark} (Chow 2006). This model also
[provides]{.mark} an [explanation of weapon fetishes]{.mark}, which
depends on an enamour with specific proper- ties [bound up in the
fantasy of using or ]{.mark}]{.underline}[possessing weapons]{.mark}.

Another model focuses on the proximity of weapons and humans. In this
case, living with weapons stimulates processes of becoming with weapons
that paradoxically take the form of a relationship of embodied care. The
soldier maintains and worries about her rifle and the nuclear scientist
for their Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). In this model,
proximity produces relations between humans and weapons that connect
dif- ferent affective properties of each entity, which become a habitual
expression of a lifeworld. The familiarity and everydayness of the
weapon thus changes the relationship between the weapon and the user.
Indeed, this relationship has been the principal object of weapon
socialisation processes such as training regiments, military exercises,
and martial arts, which rely on exposure and familiarity with weapons to
instruct a person in their proper use (Waal 2010; Grossman 2009). Each
of these [processes of familiarisation includes a potential for
[weapons]{.mark} to [redefine]{.mark} the [self]{.mark} thr[ough a set
of somatic habits and empathic links that make living with weapons a key
part of social life.]{.mark} The [proximity to weapons often fosters a
productive relationship to actual conflict]{.mark}, even in the form of
pure simulation, since proximity changes and invents a new reality or
field of conflict]{.underline} (Der Derian 2009). [[Similar
processes]{.mark} inadvertently [occur under]{.mark} duress or threat
where c[ontinuous exposure to the violence of weapons]{.mark} engenders
a change in social structures of empathy and care]{.underline}. [In this
model, [weapons]{.mark} not only [alter fantasies]{.mark} but also [the
corporeality and sociality of the bodies that encounter them]{.mark}.
The significant effort to decouple weapon users from their weapons,
through institutions such as training and legal distinctions under the
laws of war, reflects the potency of this relationship since, as
safeguards, they presuppose the capacity for the familiarity with
weapons to alter human conduct]{.underline} (Baker 2010; Lunasco et al.
2010). Put differently, [[weapons intervene on]{.mark} somatic rhythms
and [relations of embodiment via their proximity]{.mark} and therefore
require strict macro- and micropolitical regimes of
governance.]{.underline}

A third model understands the encounter between humans and weapons in
terms of a series of potentials introduced by weapons. This 'abstract'
reading derives from weapons ability to synthesise a variety of discrete
connections between objects, humans, and larger assemblages including
the construction, use, and care of weapons. These potentials, which
remain unactualised, produce contingent reactions to weapons, which
cannot be predefined by the function or purpose of the weapon. Put
differently[, [a weapon operates as a pluripotential object that
stimulates multiple forms of desire that cannot be derived from the
apparent utility of weapons for humans]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
'fantasy' and 'familiarity' models would thus be only a subset of the
broader relations formed by the potential opened by the 'striking power'
affects of the weapons. In this respect, it is important recall the
earlier point that as striking instruments, weapons emerge in relation
to an exterior milieu rather than an interior territory (Deleuze and
Guattari 1987). Unlike tools, which work towards a specific end in a
process of construction and must be freed from this model to perform
otherwise, the potentiality of the weapon hinges on a far wider and
arguably more creative form of expenditure, which involves the negative
rearticulation of possibility. [Put differently, [the
potentiality]{.mark} lingering on the cutting edge [of the
weapon]{.mark}, the capacity to void other relations, [strikes human
subjects]{.mark} [and alters desires]{.mark} irrespective of their
conscious acknowledgment of the process.]{.underline} This potentiality
grows with the expansion

of processes of weaponisation and, in effect, generates positive
feedback loops. [[Weapons' potential]{.mark} [stimulates greater
investment]{.mark} [(social, economic, military,]{.mark} and affective)
[in weap- ons, which augments the potential of weapons]{.mark} in
multiple forms. The [striking power of the weapon]{.mark} not only
[works as an instrument, unconscious fantasy]{.mark}, or because of the
proximity of arms but works [also]{.mark} on [the production of human
subjectivity and desire]{.mark} at the broadest and most intimate
levels]{.underline}.

Two examples show how [[this]{.mark} third model operates and d[irectly
challenge the presumption of human sovereignty over weapons by
demonstrating how weapons influence subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}.
First, Klaus Theweleit's work Male Fantasies unpacks the forms of desire
and weaponry at work in the freikorps and Nazi leadership (1989, 1987).
Theweleit's argument, which remains largely ignored in studies of war
and conflict, [is that the [freikorps conceptions of self, state, and
society were entangled with pro- cesses of weaponisatio]{.mark}n. The
[freikorps]{.mark}, according to Theweleit, were [not exclusively intent
on the destruction of]{.mark} the Weimar Republic, Jewish
[people]{.mark}, or the Soviet Union, [but with the articulation of self
through the process of destruction itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
sense, the freikorps [[enemies were liquid, potential]{.mark}, fluidly
targeted on account of their ontological difference rather than static,
eugenic categories]{.underline}. Their image of body, society, and state
defined by a rigid schema except, as Theweleit shows, during the act of
killing, which provided a space of creativity. Destruction thus formed a
crucial part of the freikorps articulation of identity as their very
purpose was to make war 'more than a profession, \[but\] a state of
being' (Theweleit 1989, 396). [As the means of destruction, [weapons
play a powerful role in the freikorps articulation of self such that
they identify with their weapons as vehicle of a perpetual seek and
destroy mission]{.mark}]{.underline}. The freikorps thus envision their
lives as means of destruction long before engage- ment with enemies
(Theweleit 1987, 218--225). In short, [[weapons reconstruct the
freikorps very capacity to desire, the forms desire takes, and the
ultimate form of life]{.mark} of the freikorps such that they discover a
virtually unlimited series of enemies and sources of danger to
destroy]{.underline}.

#### Weapons incite aggression -- studies prove

**Bushman '13**, Margaret Hall and Robert Randal Rinehart Chair of Mass
Communication Professor at Ohio State University, \["The 'weapons
effect', Research shows that the mere presence of weapons increases
aggression,
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-psyched/201301/the-weapons-effect>,
Acc: 7.8.10, A.N.M\]

In 1967, Leonard Berkowitz and Anthony LePage conducted a fascinating
study.\[1\] First, participants were angered by a person pretending to
be another participant (called a confederate). Next, participants were
seated at a table that had a shotgun and a revolver on it---or, in the
control condition, badminton racquets and shuttlecocks. The items on the
table were described as part of another experiment that the researcher
had supposedly forgotten to put away. The participant was supposed to
decide what level of electric shock to deliver to the confederate who
had angered them, and the electric shocks were used to
measure [aggression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger).
The experimenter told participants to ignore the items on the table, but
apparently they could not. [[Participants who saw]{.mark} the [guns were
more aggressive]{.mark} than were participants who saw
the [sports](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sport-and-competition) items.
This [effect was dubbed the "weapons effect]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[Research also shows that [drivers with guns in their cars more likely
to drive aggressively]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[2\] A nationally
representative sample of over 2,000 American drivers found that those
who had a gun in the car were significantly more likely to make obscene
gestures at other motorists (23% vs. 16%), aggressively follow another
vehicle too closely (14% vs. 8%), or both (6.3% vs. 2.8%), [even after
controlling for many other factors related to aggressive
driving]{.underline}
(e.g., [gender](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender), age,
urbanization, census region, driving frequency). Recent research
replicated this finding in a driving simulation experiment.\[3\]

Human beings can identify potentially dangerous, threatening stimuli
such as spiders and snakes very quickly. This makes sense from an
evolutionary perspective because some spiders and snakes are poisonous,
and our ancient ancestors who could identify them quickly were more
likely to avoid them and live to pass on
their [genes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/genetics).
Recent research shows that people can identify guns as quickly as they
can identify spiders and snakes.\[4\]^,^\[5\]^,^\[6\] These findings are
very interesting because guns are modern threats and cannot be explained
using evolutionary principles. Yet guns are a far more dangerous to
people today than spiders or snakes. Poisonous spiders (e.g., Black
Widows, Brown Recluses) kill about 6 Americans each year.\[7\] Poisonous
snakes (e.g., rattlesnakes) kill about 5 Americans each year.\[8\] In
comparison, guns kill about 31,000 Americans each year.\[9\]

[[Several studies have replicated the weapons effect.]{.mark} A review
of 56 published studies confirmed that [the mere sight of weapons
increases aggression in both angry and nonangry
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[10\] A more recent meta-analysis of a
larger sample of 151 effect-size estimates from 78 independent studies
involving 7,668 participants found strong support for the idea [that
[weapons increase the accessibility of aggressive thoughts and hostile
appraisals]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[11\] However, more research is needed
on the link between exposure to weapons and aggression in provoked
participants, especially in field settings. A recent field study found
that the presence of a TASER significantly increased the use of force in
police officers.\[12\] Perhaps [[the weapons effect occurs because
weapons are closely linked to aggression in our
brains]{.underline}.]{.mark}

### 1AR alt fails

#### Be skeptical of vague alts who's mechanism is "consciousness raising"- we aren't addicted to war, its just a hard problem to solve 

**Quester, PhD, 89**

(George H., ChairGov&Politics@Maryland, International-Security
Criticisms of Peace Research The Annals of the American Academy of
Political and Social Science, Vol. 504,Peace Studies: Past and Future
(Jul., 1989), pp. 98-105)

Related to this first criticism of peace studies is the possible
dismissal by someone from the international-security community of much
of what is offered in peace research or peace studies as
[\"consciousness raising]{.underline},\" that is, as [stemming from
an]{.underline} explicit or implicit [assumption that the rest of us are
**insufficiently aware** of the costs of war]{.underline} and of the
advantages of peace. [At the worst]{.underline}, this becomes almost [an
insulting accusation]{.underline} that we others do not dislike war, or
at least that we do not dislike it enough. [More generally]{.underline},
there seems to be a premise that [the way to be more successful at
avoiding war,]{.underline} and at achieving peace, [is to dwell in great
detail on the awful consequences]{.underline} of war, staring at
photographs of victims at Hiroshima or My Lai, and the like. Yet [would
we try to solve any other problems this way]{.underline}? [If we wish to
find a cure for cancer, should we require that cancer researchers spend
long periods of time sharing in the suffering and grief of cancer
victims?]{.underline} Is this really the way to speed positive research
breakthroughs? If, similarly, some family wanted to earn more money,
should it have long rap sessions on how bad it would be to have to wear
homespun or how dangerous it would be to have to hitch rides to work or
school if it could not afford to maintain the family car?
[Most]{.underline} of us would [agree]{.underline} that [the cancer
researcher should better spend]{.underline} his or her [time in the
lab]{.underline}oratory and that the family trying to enhance its income
should instead be looking for jobs that will produce some cash flow. The
[peace studies]{.underline} approach seems to be on the verge of
[blam]{.underline}ing our problems on [an insufficient aversion to war
among government officials]{.underline} and the establishment,
[and]{.underline} it [extends this accusation to]{.underline} the
[people who work on national security,]{.underline} international
security, **[or arms control]{.underline}**. If [this accusation is
unfair]{.underline}, it may indeed be **[a major barrier]{.underline}**
[to any serious communication]{.underline} here. [Do people who
disagree]{.underline} with the peace researchers-for example, on whether
an elimination of poverty is necessary or sufficient for an elimination
of war-[actually like war?]{.underline} Most of us would indeed admit
that [our subject areas have a certain fascination,]{.underline} but
[this hardly means that we are **reluctant to terminate**]{.underline}
the [evils we are watching]{.underline}. [Cancer researchers are often
fascinated]{.underline} by the disease; [are they]{.underline} therefore
[deliberately stalling]{.underline} in finding a cure, so as not to end
their entertainment? It was not a Prussian general but the beloved and
gentlemanly Robert E. Lee who said that \"it\'s good that war is so
horrible, for otherwise we would enjoy it too much\"; but would anyone
argue that he was prolonging the Civil War merely to amuse himself?
Speaking for the international-security research community, I propose
that it would be easy to claim that we all have had more than enough
wars in history to nourish our intellectual appetites, so that we hardly
need any more. [The peace studies approach]{.underline}, [in
its]{.underline} frequent [allusions to consciousness and
\"paradigms]{.underline},\" [tends to question the values]{.underline}
and the [priorities and]{.underline} the [sincerities of those who do
not accept its assumptions about **what is possible.**]{.underline} The
international-security community would normally counter that the
[disagreement is not about values or]{.underline} awareness or
[paradigms but]{.underline} about **[analysis.]{.underline}** Are the
questions so easy? Are the answers presented to students in peace
studies curricula so sure? For example, [would]{.underline} the [total
nuclear disarmament]{.underline} of the Soviet Union and the United
States [make it less likely that a Qaddafi would seek nuclear
weapons]{.underline} of his own, [or]{.underline} would it make it [more
likely?]{.underline} And [what are we then to do]{.underline} about
vertical and horizontal nuclear proliferation if there is no preordained
linkage that all of these threats to peace recede in the same move?

### 1AR realism

#### Turn---any move away from realism relies on a leap of faith that would lead to more violence.

This highlights the central difficulty with Wendt's constructivism. It
is not any form of unfounded idealism about the possibility of effective
a change in international politics. Wendt accepts that [the
intersubjective character of international institutions such as
self-help render them]{.underline} relatively [hard social
facts]{.underline}. Rather, [what is problematic is]{.underline} his
[faith that]{.underline} such [change]{.underline}, if it could be
achieved, [implies *progress*]{.underline}. **[Wendt's entire approach
is governed by the belief that the problematic elements of international
politics can be transcended]{.underline}**, that the competitive
identities which create these elements can be reconditioned, and that
the predatory policies which underlie these identities can be
eliminated. Everything, in his account, is up for grabs: there is no
core of recalcitrance to human conduct which cannot be reformed,
unlearnt, disposed of. [This generates a stance that so privileges the
possibility of a systemic transformation that it simply **puts aside the
difficulties which it recognises to be inherent in its
achievement**]{.underline}. Thus, even though Wendt acknowledges that
the intersubjective basis of the self-help system makes it reform
difficult, this does not dissuade him. He simply demands that states
adopt a strategy of 'altercasting', a strategy which 'tries to induce
alter to take on a new identity (and thereby enlist alter in ego's
effort to change itself) by treating alter *as if* it already had that
identity'. [Wendt's position effectively culminates in a demand that the
state undertake nothing less than a **giant leap of faith**. The fact
that its opponent might not take its overtures seriously, might not be
interested in reformulating its own construction of the world, or might
simply see such an opening as a weakness to be exploited, are completely
discounted]{.underline}. The prospect of achieving a system
transformation simply outweighs any adverse consequences which might
arise from the effort to achieve it. Wendt ultimately appears, in the
final analysis, to have overdosed on 'Gorbimania'.

#### We challenge a lot of their reasons why realism is bad by reducing arms sales in the first place

Potential of the Arms Trade Treaty Paterson Review of International

The [contemporary]{.underline} security [discourse
identifies]{.underline} the [control of SALW]{.underline} proliferation
[as a global security initiative]{.underline}.2 [Historically, however,
SALW were **irrelevant** to]{.underline} the international [security
discourse.]{.underline} The original [Cold War "arms
control]{.underline}" agenda of the 1960s [looked to reduce]{.underline}
the risks, severity, and [costs of war]{.underline} between states
through legally binding, verifiable treaties of agreed military
constraints in the "numbers, types, [deployment or use" of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} and related military technologies (Krause 2011,
26). [SALW were neglected]{.underline} since they were [perceived to be
inconsequential to the balance of military power]{.underline} between
the two blocs of states led by the United States and the Soviet Union,
respectively.3 [The Cold War was dominated by a realist]{.underline}, or
**[state-centric, security paradigm]{.underline}**, which conceived of
"the state as the subject of security and anarchy the eternal condition
of international relations" (Krause and Williams 1996, 232). According
to this view, states seek to increase their security vis-à-vis other
states by strengthening their relative military power. [The end of the
Cold War led to a **broadening and deepening** of the security
discourse.]{.underline} Types of security threats were broadened to
include non-state actors; and the subject of security was deepened, most
notably to define security in terms of the protection of civilians, or
"human security" (ibid., 230).4 Thus [it became popular]{.underline} in
the post--Cold War arms control discourse [to talk of "humanitarian arms
control]{.underline} and disarmament" to reduce the risks to civilians
of certain "inhumane" and "indiscriminate" weapons (Cooper and Mutimer
2011, 10; Krause 2011, 35). The Convention on the Prohibition of the
Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
their Destruction (MBT), signed in 1997, and the Convention on Cluster
Munitions (CCM), signed in 2008, are examples of this new arms control
agenda. Recently, [arms control has been reconceptualized as
"controlling the means of violence,"]{.underline} **[implying a broader
scope]{.underline}** [to address questions of "who can possess, use,
develop and transfer the technologies of violence, under what
circumstances, against whom, and for what ends]{.underline}" (ibid.,
29). [The objectives]{.underline} of this reconceptualization [are as
follows]{.underline}: "1. To [reduce the likelihood that the instruments
of armed violence are used against individuals, communities, or states;
2. To reduce the effects of armed violence]{.underline} should it be
employed; and 3. To [reduce the resources employed]{.underline} in the
development, acquisition and deployment of the instruments of armed
violence" (Cooper and Mutimer 2011, 11). [As the threats to global
security have changed, the arms control agenda has **followed
suit**]{.underline} in an effort to contain the primary tools of
destruction. SALW control has thus become an issue of prominence in the
contemporary security discourse (Garcia 2006, 29). In 1993, then Malian
president Alpha Oumar Konaré requested that then UN secretary-general
Boutros Boutros-Ghali send a UN mission to observe the effects of
uncontrolled SALW proliferation in his country. At the time, scholars
such as Edward Laurence (1992) were also beginning to focus on the
security implications of the international arms trade, particularly the
SALW trade. In 1995, Boutros-Ghali called for international attention to
the need to control SALW proliferation and for the disarmament of these
weapons, which "are actually killing people in the hundreds of
thousands," at the ground level (UNGA 1995). By the late 1990s, SALW
control became one of the most important security priorities of a large
number of states (Garcia 2006, 18--19). (37-8)
